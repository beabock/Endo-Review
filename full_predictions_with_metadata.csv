"The REMI method was used to introduce the plasmid pV2 harboring the hygromycin B phosphotransferase (hph) gene controlled by the Aspergillus nidulans trpC promoter and the trpC terminator into a taxol-producing endophytic fungus BT2. REMI transformation yielded stable transformants capable of continuing to grow on PDA medium containing 125 mu g mL(-1) hygromycin B. The transformation efficiency was about 5-6 transformants mu g(-1) plasmid DNA. The presence of hph gene in transformants was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analyses. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on the transformation of taxol-producing endophytic fungi by the REMI technique. This study provides an effective approach for improving taxol production of endophytic fungi by the genetic engineering of taxol biosynthetic pathway genes in the future.","J","Wang, YC; Guo, BH; Miao, ZQ; Tang, KX",NA,"","","Wang, Yechun; Guo, Binhui; Miao, Zhiqi; Tang, Kexuan",NA,NA,"Transformation of taxol-producing endophytic fungi by restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI)","FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tang, Kexuan/E-3555-2013; Wang, Ye/GWQ-7482-2022","Tang, Kexuan/0000-0002-8748-9624;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0378-1097","1574-6968","",NA,NA,"AUG",2007,273,"2",NA,"","",NA,"253","259","","10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00801.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00801.x","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,17608701,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000248800600017","View Full Record in Web of Science",1,"Presence"
"Patients suffering from inflammatory chronic diseases are classically treated with anti-inflammatory drugs but unfortunately are highly susceptible to becoming resistant to their treatment. Finding new drugs is therefore crucial and urgent and research on endophytic fungi is a promising way forward. Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that colonize healthy plants and live within their intercellular tissues. They are able to produce a large variety of secondary metabolites while allowing their host to stay healthy. A number of these molecules are endowed with antioxidant or antimicrobial as well as cytotoxic properties, making them very interesting/promising in the field of human therapy. The aim of our study was to investigate whether extracts from five endophytic fungi isolated from plants are endowed with anti-inflammatory activity. Extracts of the endophytic fungi Alternaria alternata from Calotropis procera leaves and Aspergillus terreus from Trigonella foenum-graecum seeds were able to counteract the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pro-inflammatory effect on THP-1 cells differentiated into macrophages. Moreover, they were able to induce an anti-inflammatory state, rendering them less sensitive to the LPS pro-inflammatory stimulus. Taken together, these results show that these both endophytic fungi could be interesting alternatives to conventional anti-inflammatory drugs. To gain more detailed knowledge of their chemical richness, phytochemical analysis of the ethyl acetate extracts of the five endophytic fungi studied was performed using HPTLC, GC-MS and LC-MS with the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) platform and the MolNetEnhancer tool. A large family of metabolites (carboxylic acids and derivatives, steroid derivatives, alkaloids, hydroxyanthraquinones, valerolactones and perylenequinones) were detected. The purification of endophytic fungus extract of Alternaria alternate, which diminished TNF-alpha production of 66% at 20 mu g/mL, incubated one hour before LPS addition, led to the characterization of eight pure compounds. These molecules are altertoxins I, II, III, tricycloalternarenes 3a, 1b, 2b, anthranilic acid, and o-acetamidobenzoic acid. In the future, all these pure compounds will be evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activity, while altertoxin II has been shown in the literature as the most active mycotoxin in terms of anti-inflammatory activity.","J","Spina, R; Ropars, A; Bouazzi, S; Dadi, S; Lemiere, P; Dupire, F; Khiralla, A; Yagi, S; Frippiat, JP; Laurain-Mattar, D",NA,"","","Spina, Rosella; Ropars, Armelle; Bouazzi, Sihem; Dadi, Safa; Lemiere, Pascal; Dupire, Francois; Khiralla, Afra; Yagi, Sakina; Frippiat, Jean-Pol; Laurain-Mattar, Dominique",NA,NA,"Screening of Anti-Inflammatory Activity and Metabolomics Analysis of Endophytic Fungal Extracts; Identification and Characterization of Perylenequinones and Terpenoids from the Interesting Active Alternaria Endophyte","MOLECULES","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Frippiat, Jean-Pol/0000-0002-4027-6269",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1420-3049","",NA,NA,"SEP",2023,28,"18",NA,"","",NA,"","","6531","10.3390/molecules28186531","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules28186531","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37764307,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001076799200001","View Full Record in Web of Science",2,"Presence"
"Sophora alopecuroides L. has great medicinal and ecological value in northwestern China. The host and its microbiota are mutually symbiotic, collectively forming a holobiont, conferring beneficial effects to the plant. However, the analysis of diversity, mycobiota composition, and the ecological function of endophytic fungi in the holobiont of S. alopecuroides is relatively lacking. In this article, the fungal community profiling of roots, stems, leaves, and seeds of S. alopecuroides (at the fruit maturity stage) from Huamachi and Baofeng in Ningxia, China were investigated based on the ITS1 region, using high-throughput sequencing technology. As a result, a total of 751 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained and further classified into 9 phyla, 27 classes, 66 orders, 141 families, 245 genera, and 340 species. The roots had the highest fungal richness and diversity, while the stems had the highest evenness and pedigree diversity. There also was a significant difference in the richness of the endophytic fungal community between root and seed (p < 0.05). The organ was the main factor affecting the community structure of endophytic fungi in S. alopecuroides. The genera of unclassified Ascomycota, Tricholoma, Apiotrichum, Alternaria, and Aspergillus made up the vast majority of relative abundance, which were common in all four organs as well. The dominant and endemic genera and biomarkers of endophytic fungi in four organs of S. alopecuroides were different and exhibited organ specificity or tissue preference. The endophytic fungi of S. alopecuroides were mainly divided into 15 ecological function groups, among which saprotroph was absolutely dominant, followed by mixotrophic and pathotroph, and the symbiotroph was the least. With this study, we revealed the diversity and community structure and predicted the ecological function of the endophytic fungi of S. alopecuroides, which provided a theoretical reference for the further development and utilization of the endophytic fungi resources of S. alopecuroides.","J","Wang, RT; Zhang, QC; Ju, MX; Yan, SY; Zhang, QQ; Gu, PW",NA,"","","Wang, Ruotong; Zhang, Qingchen; Ju, Mingxiu; Yan, Siyuan; Zhang, Qiangqiang; Gu, Peiwen",NA,NA,"The Endophytic Fungi Diversity, Community Structure, and Ecological Function Prediction of Sophora alopecuroides in Ningxia, China","MICROORGANISMS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Wang, Ruotong/0000-0002-1055-1856",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2076-2607","",NA,NA,"NOV",2022,10,"11",NA,"","",NA,"","","2099","10.3390/microorganisms10112099","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10112099","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36363690,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000881334900001","View Full Record in Web of Science",3,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi are an important component of plant microbiota, and have the excellent capacity for producing a broad variety of bioactive metabolites. These bioactive metabolites not only affect the survival of the host plant, but also provide valuable lead compounds for novel drug discovery. In this study, forty-two endophytic filamentous fungi were isolated from Ficus elastica leaves, and further identified as seven individual taxa by ITS-rDNA sequencing. The antimicrobial activity of these endophytic fungi was evaluated against five pathogenic microorganisms. Two strains, Fes1711 (Penicillium funiculosum) and Fes1712 (Trichoderma harzianum), displayed broad-spectrum bioactivities. Our following study emphasizes the isolation, identification and bioactivity testing of chemical metabolites produced by T. harzianum Fes1712. Two new isocoumarin derivatives (1 and 2), together with three known compounds (3-5) were isolated, and their structures were elucidated using NMR and MS. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli. Our findings reveal that endophytic fungi from the rubber tree F. elastica leaves exhibit unique characteristics and are potential producers of novel natural bioactive products.","J","Ding, Z; Tao, T; Wang, LL; Zhao, YN; Huang, HM; Zhang, DM; Liu, M; Wang, ZP; Han, J",NA,"","","Ding, Zhuang; Tao, Tao; Wang, Lili; Zhao, Yanna; Huang, Huiming; Zhang, Demeng; Liu, Min; Wang, Zhengping; Han, Jun",NA,NA,"Bioprospecting of Novel and Bioactive Metabolites from Endophytic Fungi Isolated from Rubber Tree Ficus elastica Leaves","JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zhang, Demeng/HHS-8711-2022; wang, lin/HZK-4145-2023; wang, lili/HDL-7210-2022","Han, Jun/0000-0001-9224-0033",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1017-7825","1738-8872","",NA,NA,"MAY",2019,29,"5",NA,"","",NA,"731","738","","10.4014/jmb.1901.01015","http://dx.doi.org/10.4014/jmb.1901.01015","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31030449,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000469201000007","View Full Record in Web of Science",4,"Presence"
"Sixty-one endophytic fungus strains with different colony morphologies were isolated from the leaves, stems and roots of Tephrosia purpurea with colonization rates of 66.95%, 37.50%, and 26.92%, respectively. Based on internal transcribed spacer sequence analysis, 61 isolates were classified into 16 genera belonging to 3 classes under the phylum Ascomycota. Of the 61 isolates, 6 (9.84%) exhibited antifungal activity against one or more indicator plant pathogenic fungi according to the dual culture test. Isolate TPL25 had the broadest antifungal spectrum of activity, and isolate TPL35 was active against 5 plant pathogenic fungi. Furthermore, culture filtrates of TPL25 and TPL35 exhibited greater than 80% growth inhibition against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum.

"Background: Plants with an ethnobotanical history are known to harbor diverse group of endophytic fungi, which constitute major natural sources of bioactive compounds. In the present study, we evaluated the antioxidant activity of endophytic fungi from eight Nigerian ethnomedicinal plants. Endophytic fungi were isolated from the leaves of Acalypha ornata, Albizia zygia, Alchornea cordifolia, Chrysophyllum albidum, Ficus exasperata, Gomphrena celosioides, Millettia thonningii, and Newbouldia laevis. Methods: Endophytic fungi were isolated from the leaves of selected plants via surface sterilization. Isolated fungi were identified by internal transcribed spacer (ITS-rDNA) sequence analysis. Pure fungal strains were subjected to fermentation process on solid rice medium and metabolites extracted using ethyl-acetate. Fungal crude extracts were screened for antioxidant activity using 2, 2- diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and reduction of ferric ion assays. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis was used to identify the major chemical constituents in active fungal extracts. Results: A total of eighteen fungal endophytes with fungal codes CU (061 and 062); ZA (161, 162, 163, and 164); LO (261); CA (041, 042, and 043); FE (081, 082, and 084); GE (091); MO (211 and 212); and NA (021 and 022) were isolated from the eight ethnomedicinal plants A. ornata, A. zygia, A. cordifolia, C. albidum, F. exasperata, G. celosioides, M. thonningii, and N. laevis respectively. ZA 163 and MO 211 fungal extracts showed significant (p < 0.05) radical scavenging activity with IC50 values of 50.53 +/- 0.01 and 86.69 +/- 0.02 mu g/ml respectively. Fungal extract CA 041 demonstrated significantly (p < 0.01) higher iron chelating activity than standard gallic acid with absorbance values of 0.803 and 1.107 at 250 and 500 mu g/ml concentrations respectively.

"Studies involving endophytic fungi isolated from endemic plants and their antibacterial potential are largely unknown in the Pampa biome. In this study, we identified endophytic fungi isolated from Kelissa brasiliensis (Iridaceae), an endemic species of the Brazilian Pampa, and assessed their antibacterial activity. Endophytic fungi were first grouped based on macro-and micro-morphology, and one representative of each morphospecies was analyzed using sequences from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA region. We then tested the fungal extracts against laboratory isolates of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli for antibacterial activity. A total of 30 endophytes were isolated from the tissues of K. brasiliensis, with the majority from the leaves. Endophytes were then grouped into seven morphospecies based on their morphological features and one representative from each was selected for phylogenetic analysis. The inference from the ITS rDNA sequences identified the endophytes of the seven selected morphospecies as belonging to six taxonomic groups: Colletotrichum (two), Diaporthe (one), Epicoccum (one), Fusarium (one), and Pestalotiopsis (one). The endophyte extracts revealed better results against E. coli than S. aureus, although the extracts from Colletotrichum and Pestalotiopsis sp. were statistically similar to the control antibiotic. Our study is a basis for endophytic fungi studies in Pampa.","J","de Andrade, GAK; Bezerra, JDP; de Vargas, MVM; Bernardes, BM; Goulart, SNB; Alves, RP; Küster, MCT; Pereira, AB; Victoria, FD",NA,"","","Kessler de Andrade, Guilherme Afonso; Pereira Bezerra, Jadson Diogo; Magalhaes de Vargas, Maria Victoria; Bernardes, Bruna Mota; Bohi Goulart, Sara Navarrete; Alves, Rodrigo Paidano; Tesche Kuster, Mariele Cristine; Pereira, Antonio Batista; Victoria, Filipe de Carvalho",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi from an overlooked plant species: A case study in Kelissa brasiliensis (Baker) Ravenna","ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bezerra, Jadson DP/A-5846-2019; Paidano Alves, Rodrigo/L-6987-2017; Victoria, Filipe/F-6066-2013","Bezerra, Jadson DP/0000-0002-7782-8602; Paidano Alves, Rodrigo/0000-0003-1009-5923; Pereira, Antonio/0000-0003-0368-4594; Victoria Magalhaes de Vargas, Maria/0000-0003-0651-4953; Victoria, Filipe/0000-0002-8580-1813; Bernardes, Bruna/0000-0001-9883-3649; Kessler de Andrade, Guilherme Afonso/0000-0003-3511-1774; Tesche Kuster, Mariele Cristine/0000-0003-3143-2300; Bohi, Sara/0000-0001-7259-2007",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0102-3306","1677-941X","",NA,NA,"",2022,36,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","e2020abb0426","10.1590/0102-33062020abb0426","http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0102-33062020abb0426","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000771776700001","View Full Record in Web of Science",7,"Presence"
"Over the last century, endophytic fungi have gained tremendous attention due to their ability to produce novel bioactive compounds exhibiting varied biological properties and are, therefore, utilized for medicinal, pharmaceutical, and agricultural applications. Endophytic fungi reside within the plant tissues without showing any disease symptoms, thus supporting the physiological and ecological attributes of the host plant. Ground breaking lead compounds, such as paclitaxel and penicillin, produced by endophytic fungi have paved the way for exploring novel bioactive compounds for commercial usage. Despite this, limited research has been conducted in this valuable and unique niche area. These bioactive compounds belong to various structural groups, including alkaloids, peptides, steroids, terpenoids, phenols, quinones, phenols, and flavonoids. The current review focuses on the significance of endophytic fungi in producing novel bioactive compounds possessing a variety of biological properties that include antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antiprotozoal, antiparasitic, antioxidant, immunosuppressant, and anticancer functions. Taking into consideration the portal of this publication, special emphasis is placed on the antimicrobial and antiviral activities of metabolites produced by endophytes against human pathogens. It also highlights the importance of utilization of these compounds as potential treatment agents for serious life-threatening infectious diseases. This is supported by the fact that several findings have indicated that these bioactive compounds may significantly contribute towards the fight against resistant human and plant pathogens, thus motivating the need enhance the search for new, more efficacious and cost-effective antimicrobial drugs.","J","Manganyi, MC; Ateba, CN",NA,"","","Manganyi, Madira Coutlyne; Ateba, Collins Njie",NA,NA,"Untapped Potentials of Endophytic Fungi: A Review of Novel Bioactive Compounds with Biological Applications","MICROORGANISMS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"MANGANYI, MADIRA COUTLYNE/AAE-3590-2022","MANGANYI, MADIRA COUTLYNE/0000-0002-0209-5547; Dlamini, Sicelo Beauty/0000-0002-0227-1432",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2076-2607","",NA,NA,"DEC",2020,8,"12",NA,"","",NA,"","","1934","10.3390/microorganisms8121934","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8121934","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33291214,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000602505600001","View Full Record in Web of Science",8,"Review"
"Background Rhizosphere fungi and endophytic fungi play key roles in plant growth and development; however, their role in the growth of Epimedium koreanum Nakai at different stages remains unclear. Here, we used the Illumina MiSeq system, a high-throughput sequencing technology, to study the endophytic fungi and rhizosphere microbiome of Korean Epimedium. Results Epimedium koreanum Nakai rhizosphere soil and leaves had highly diverse fungal communities during the growth process. The relative abundance of soil fungi in the rhizosphere stage was higher than that of leaf endophytic fungi in the early growth stage, but the overall abundance was basically equal. Sebacina is a significantly divergent fungal genera, and Sebacina sp. are present among leaf fungi species in the rhizosphere soil of Epimedium koreanum Nakai. Sebacina sp. can move to each other in rhizosphere soil fungi and leaf endophytes. VIF (variance inflation factor) analysis showed that soluble salt, whole nitrogen, alkaline lysis nitrogen, whole phosphorus, total potassium, and fast-acting potassium are useful environmental factors for rhizosphere soil and leaf endophytic fungi: potassium, total nitrogen, whole phosphorus, and three environmental factors were significantly and positively associated with the relative abundance of Sebacina sp. Conclusions (1) This study is the first to clarify the species diversity of fungi in Epimedium koreanum Nakai leaf and rhizosphere soil. (2) Different fungal communities of rhizosphere soil fungi and leaf endophytic fungi at different growth stages of Epimedium koreanum Nakai were examined. (3) Sebacina sp. can move to each other between rhizosphere soil fungi and leaf endophytic fungi.

"Cerrado is the second largest biome in Brazil, and it is known for harboring a wide variety of endemic plant and microbial species, among which are endophytic fungi. Endophytic fungi are microorganisms capable of colonizing the interior of plant tissues without causing disease in host plants. Especially in the Cerrado biome, this group of microorganisms is still poorly studied and information on species estimation, ecological and evolutionary importance is not accurate and remains unknown. Also, it is extremely important to emphasize that great part of studies available on Cerrado endophytic fungi are national literature, including master's dissertations, course conclusion works or unpublished doctoral theses. The majority of these studies has highlighted that the endemic plant species are an important habitat for fungal endophytes, and new species have increasingly been described. Due to the lack of international literature on Cerrado endophytic fungi, the present review brings a bibliographic survey on taxonomic diversity and bioprospecting potential of fungal endophytes from a unique environment.

"Current rates of population growth require the development of new agricultural strategies to feed the world human and livestock. The massive use of agricultural chemicals causes serious damage to the environment, and to human and animal health. For this reason, the use of endophytic fungi represents a biological alternative in increasing agricultural productivity in a sustainable way. This group of microorganisms, which inhabit plant tissues and organs without causing symptoms of damage, includes a great diversity of filamentous fungi and yeasts that are capable of increasing agricultural productivity. Some of the mechanisms involved in promoting plant growth by means of endophytic fungi include the increasing access to nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, iron, etc.), production of plant hormones, the ethylene amount reduction, or increase in water acquisition rate. This review tries to compile all the works carried out in the last decades on endophytic fungi use as plant growth promoters with great potential in agriculture.","J","Poveda, J; Eugui, D; Abril-Urías, P; Velasco, P",NA,"","","Poveda, Jorge; Eugui, Daniel; Abril-Urias, Patricia; Velasco, Pablo",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi as direct plant growth promoters for sustainable agricultural production","SYMBIOSIS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Velasco, Pablo/C-3902-2012; Poveda, Jorge/AAH-1159-2019","Velasco, Pablo/0000-0003-3046-8918; Poveda, Jorge/0000-0002-1415-3580; Eugui Arrizabalaga, Daniel/0000-0002-0100-5175",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0334-5114","1878-7665","",NA,NA,"SEP",2021,85,"1",NA,"","",NA,"1","19","","10.1007/s13199-021-00789-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-021-00789-x","","AUG 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000681528900001","View Full Record in Web of Science",11,"Review"
"We tested the hypothesis that an endophytic fungus, Acremonium starrii (White & Morgan Jones), deters redlegged grasshoppers, Melanoplus femurrubrum (De Geer), from feeding on Arizona fescue, Festuca arizonica (Vasey), a native grass, Arizona fescue plants were screened and classified according to their level of endophyte infection. In the laboratory, we presented grasshoppers with grass clippings from plants of high or low endophyte infection levels either simultaneously (choice) or separately (no choice), and we measured the amount of each eaten by the grasshoppers. In the held, we monitored the mass of grasshoppers placed in cages built around plants of high or low levels of infection. In all cases, we found that grasshoppers consumed similar amounts of grasses with high and low infection levels, contrary to the prediction that endophytic fungi deter herbivores.

"Endophytic fungi were isolated from roots of six halophytes in Suncheon Bay. The endophytic fungi of 35 species isolated from halophytes were identified by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) containing the ITSI, 5.8s, and ITS2 regions. All fungal strains were analyzed to diversity at the genus level. Fungal culture filtrates (FCF) of endophytic fungi were treated to Waito-c rice (WR) seedling for plant growth-promoting verification. It was confirmed that fungal strain Sj-2-2 provided plant growth promotion (PGP) to WR seedling. Then, PGP of Suaeda japonica was confirmed by treating culture filtrate of Sj-2-2. As a result, it was verified that culture filtrate of Sj-2-2 had more advanced PGP than positive control when treated to S. japonica. The secondary metabolites involved in culture filtrate of Sj-2-2 were identified by HPLC and GC-MS SIM analysis. The presence of physiologically bioactive gibberellins (GAs) and other inactive GAs in culture filtrate of Sj-2-2 was detected. The molecular analysis of sequences of Sj-2-2 showed the similarity to Penicillium sp. of 99% homology. The PGP of Sj-2-2 as well as symbiosis between endophytic fungi and halophytes growing naturally in salt marsh was confirmed. Sj-2-2 was identified as a new fungal strain producing GAs by molecular analysis of sequences. Consequently, the Sj-2-2 fungal strain was named as Penicillium sp. Sj-2-2. In this study, the diversity of endophytic fungi isolated from roots of halophytes in salt marsh and the PGP of a new gibberellin-producing fungal strain were confirmed.","J","You, YH; Yoon, H; Kang, SM; Shin, JH; Choo, YS; Lee, IJ; Lee, JM; Kim, JG",NA,"","","You, Young-Hyun; Yoon, Hyeokjun; Kang, Sang-Mo; Shin, Jae-Ho; Choo, Yeon-Sik; Lee, In-Jung; Lee, Jin-Man; Kim, Jong-Guk",NA,NA,"Fungal Diversity and Plant Growth Promotion of Endophytic Fungi from Six Halophytes in Suncheon Bay","JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Lee, In-Jung/GLS-0432-2022","Lee, In-Jung/0000-0001-7154-4820",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1017-7825","1738-8872","",NA,NA,"NOV",2012,22,"11",NA,"","",NA,"1549","1556","","10.4014/jmb.1205.05010","http://dx.doi.org/10.4014/jmb.1205.05010","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,23124347,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000311761600014","View Full Record in Web of Science",13,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi from Dragon's blood specimens of different locations of China were characterized taxonomically and investigated concerning their antimicrobial and antitumor activity against six pathogenic microbes and five tumor cells. A total of 49 endophytic fungi were obtained from Dragon's blood materials of Dracaena spp., 18 taxa were represented by 43 (87.8%) isolates and only six (12.2%) isolates were unknown. Twenty (40.8%) of the isolates displayed antimicrobial activity against at least one pathogenic microorganism. Three isolates YNDC07, BJDC06 and BJDC09 displayed significant antimicrobial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigates, respectively. The results of antitumor activity by the MTT assay revealed that 26.5%, 69.4%, 48.9%, 6.1% and 42.9% of isolate fermentation broths displayed growth inhibition on HepG2 cells, SKVO3 cells, MCF7 cells, HL-60 cells and 293-T cells, respectively. HNDC09 and HNDC10 showed very strong antitumor activity against MCF7 and 293-T, respectively.

"Many endophytic fungi have been reported with the biosynthetic potential to produce same or similar metabolites present in host plants. The adaptations that might have acquired by these fungi as a result of the long-term association with their host plants can be the possible basis of their biosynthetic potential. The bioactive compounds originated from endophytes are currently explored for their potential applications in pharmaceutical, agriculture and food industries. Piper nigrum, a plant of the Piperaceae is very remarkable because of the presence of the alkaloid piperine. Piperine has been reported to have broad bioactive properties ranging from antimicrobial, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory, antioxidative to anticancer activities. Interestingly, piperine also plays a vital role in increasing the bioavailability of many drugs which again is a promising property. The current study was carried out to identify piperine producing endophytic fungus from Piper nigrum L. By screening various endophytic fungi, the isolate which was identified as member of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was found to have the ability to form piperine and was confirmed by HPLC and LCMS. Considering the broad bioactive potential of piperine, the piperine producing fungi identified in the study can expect to have much industrial potential. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH.

"As mycorrhizal fungi, endophytic fungi are ubiquitous in natural forest ecosystems. A great number of foliar endophytic fungi (FEFs) have been isolated from leaves of forest trees, and some metabolites are also isolated and characterized from the FEFs. These metabolites show strong potential to inhibit or kill insects and pathogenic fungi, especially those causing decline or damage of forest trees. In addition, FEFs can inhabit in leaf litter for a short or long period depending on endophytic species, thus they affect decomposition rate of leaf litter. Some FEFs can colonize in plant roots and promote plant growth. In the review, we provide an overview of the ecological roles of FEFs and hope the resources of FEFs can be developed and be used in forestry and agriculture to reduce use of insectcides and fungicides and in pharmacology to maintain human health.","J","Jia, Q; Qu, JW; Mu, HN; Sun, HG; Wu, C",NA,"","","Jia, Qie; Qu, Jinwang; Mu, Hongna; Sun, Honggang; Wu, Chu",NA,NA,"Foliar endophytic fungi: diversity in species and functions in forest ecosystems","SYMBIOSIS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wu, Chu/AAE-6602-2022","Wu, Chu/0000-0001-7609-3336; Qu, Jin-wang/0000-0001-5331-2460",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0334-5114","1878-7665","",NA,NA,"MAR",2020,80,"2",NA,"","",NA,"103","132","","10.1007/s13199-019-00663-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-019-00663-x","","JAN 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000510092200001","View Full Record in Web of Science",16,"Review"
"Endophytic fungi and ectomycorrhizal fungi co-exist in the mycorrhizal root tips of boreal forest trees. However, very little is known about the functional role they play in their host's biology. The activity of enzymes responsible for important biochemical processes is used to determine the functional role of root-associated mycorrhizal fungi. However, enzyme activity is never studied in the presence of endophytic fungi in-planta. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) root-isolated fungal endophytes on the host plant root morphology, to determine their functional effects using host root-excreted enzyme activity measurements, and to compare them with roots colonized by decomposer and ectomycorrhizal fungal strains and noncolonised Scots pine root tips. Our results show that endophytic fungi did not damage the pine roots in contrast to the decomposer fungi. The endophytic fungi penetrated the cortical cells of the host plant. The roots colonised by endophytic fungi produce different exo-enzymes compared with those produced by roots colonized by other fungal groups or noncolonized control root tips. Our results indicate that endophytic fungi are clearly a distinctive ecological group of fungi that have functional traits different from those of ectomycorrhizal and decomposer fungi.","J","Heinonsalo, J; Buée, M; Vaario, LM",NA,"","","Heinonsalo, Jussi; Buee, Marc; Vaario, Lu-Min",NA,NA,"Root-endophytic fungi cause morphological and functional differences in Scots pine roots in contrast to ectomycorrhizal fungi","BOTANY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"孙, 晓茜/JLM-7573-2023","Heinonsalo, Jussi/0000-0001-8516-1388; Buee, Marc/0000-0001-8614-3886",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1916-2790","1916-2804","",NA,NA,"FEB",2017,95,"2",NA,"","",NA,"203","210","","10.1139/cjb-2016-0161","http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2016-0161","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000395447200010","View Full Record in Web of Science",17,"Presence"
"Plants cope with abiotic stress in several ways, including by collaborating with microorganisms. Epichloe, an endophytic fungus, has been shown to improve plant tolerance to extreme external environments. Hordeum bogdanii is a known salt-tolerant plant with the potential to improve alkaline lands. NHX1 plays a key role in the transport of ions in the cell and is overexpressed in plants with increased salt tolerance. However, the expression levels of HbNHX1 in Epichloe endophytic fungal symbionts in H. bogdanii have not been elucidated. We used Hordeum bogdanii (E+) with the endophytic fungi Epichloe bromicola and H. bogdanii (E-) without the endophytic fungi and compared the differences in the ion content and HbNHX1 expression between the shoots and roots of E+ and E- plants under alkaline stress. The absorption capacity of both K+ and Na+ of H. bogdanii with endophytic fungi was higher than that without endophytic fungi. In the absence of alkaline stress, endophytic fungi significantly reduced the Cl- content in the host H. bogdanii. Alkaline stress reduced SO42- content in H. bogdanii; however, compared with E-, endophytic fungi increased the content of SO42- in E+ plants. With an increase in the alkaline concentration, the expression of HbNHX1 in the roots of H. bogdanii with endophytic fungus exhibited an upward trend, whereas the expression in the shoots exhibited a downward trend first and then an upward trend. Under 100 mmol center dot L-1 mixed alkaline stress, the expression of HbNHX1 in E+ was significantly higher than that in E-, indicating that endophytic fungi could increase the Na+ region in vacuoles. The external environment affects the regulation of endophytic fungi in H. bogdanii and that endophytic fungi can play a key role in soil salinization. Therefore, the findings of this study will provide technical support and a theoretical basis for better utilization of endophytic fungi from H. bogdanii in saline land improvement.","J","Long, F; Hu, MF; Chen, S; Bao, GS; Dan, H; Chen, SH",NA,"","","Long, Feng; Hu, Meng-Fei; Chen, Sheng; Bao, Gen-Sheng; Dan, Han; Chen, Shui-Hong",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungi Regulate HbNHX1 Expression and Ion Balance in Hordeum bogdanii under Alkaline Stress","JOURNAL OF FUNGI","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hu, Mengfei/ABG-3590-2020; Long, Feng/AAN-4694-2021","Hu, Mengfei/0000-0003-4272-144X;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2309-608X","",NA,NA,"MAR",2023,9,"3",NA,"","",NA,"","","331","10.3390/jof9030331","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof9030331","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36983499,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000958230700001","View Full Record in Web of Science",18,"Presence"

The endophytic fungi were recovered using four different media, namely, Malt Extract Agar (MEA) media, Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) media, Water Agar (WA) media and media amended with the Plant Extract (PEA) from samples collected from three sites. Altogether, 18 isolates of endophytic fungi were isolated from 150 surface sterilized and healthy leaf fragments. Colletotrichum was found to be dominant endophytic genus with 7 different species. Other isolated endophytic fungal genera were Fusarium, Curvularia, Aspergillus, Corynespora and isolates belonging non-sporulating fungi categorised as Mycelia Sterilia. The endophytic fungi were determined for antimicrobial activity against selected clinically significant human pathogenic test organisms. Ethyl acetate crude extracts of all endophytic fungi exhibited antimicrobial activity by inhibiting a minimum of one of the four test pathogens. Amongst the isolates, crude extracts obtained from Fusarium sp. and five Colletotrichum spp. showed wide-spectrum antimicrobial activity against all the test organisms. The study indicated that Z. oxyphyllum harbours a wide range of endophytes capable of producing secondary metabolites with antimicrobial properties.

"Plant endophytic fungi are an important and novel resource of natural bioactive compounds with their potential applications in agriculture, medicine and food industry. In the past two decades, many valuable bioactive compounds with antimicrobial, insecticidal, cytotoxic, and anticancer activities have been successfully discovered from endophytic fungi. During the long period of co-evolution, a friendly relationship was formed between each endophyte and its host plant. Some endophytes have the ability to produce the same or similar bioactive compounds as those originated from their host plants. This review mainly deals with the research progress on endophytic fungi for producing plant-derived bioactive compounds such as paclitaxel, podophyllotoxin, camptothecine, vinblastine, hypericin, and diosgenin. The relations between endophytic fungi and their host plants, biological activities and action mechanisms of these compounds from endophytic fungi, some available strategies for efficiently promoting production of these bioactive compounds, as well as their potential applications in the future will also be discussed. It is beneficial for us to better understand and take advantage of plant endophytic fungi.","J","Zhao, J; Shan, T; Mou, Y; Zhou, L",NA,"","","Zhao, J.; Shan, T.; Mou, Y.; Zhou, L.",NA,NA,"Plant-Derived Bioactive Compounds Produced by Endophytic Fungi","MINI-REVIEWS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zhou, Ligang/AAF-1485-2019; shan, tijiang/R-9849-2019","Zhou, Ligang/0000-0003-4681-191X;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1389-5575","1875-5607","",NA,NA,"FEB",2011,11,"2",NA,"","",NA,"159","168","","10.2174/138955711794519492","http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/138955711794519492","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,21222580,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000287356300006","View Full Record in Web of Science",23,"Review"
"Background: Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge. f. alba is a traditional Chinese herbal drug with special pharmacological effect on thromboangiitis obliterans. However, the nature source of S. miltiorrhiza Bge. f. alba is now in short supply because of the over-collection of the wild plant. To better utilize this resource, the diversity and antioxidant activity of endophytic fungi isolated from S. miltiorrhiza Bge. f. alba were investigated. Results: A total of 14 endophytic fungi were isolated from different parts of S. miltiorrhiza Bge. f. alba. Based on morphological and molecular identification, the endophytic fungi isolated were classified into four genera (Alternaria sp., Fusarium sp., Schizophyllum sp. and Trametes sp.). These fungal extracts were prepared using ethanol and evaluated for their phytochemical compounds and antioxidant activity. Alternaria alternata SaF-2 and Fusarium proliferatum SaR-2 are of particular interest because they yielded all of nine phytochemicals including saponins, phenol, flavonoids, cardiac glycosides, steroids, tannins, alkaloids, anthroquinone and terpenoids. F. proliferatum SaR-2 and A. alternata SaF-2 also exhibited stronger antioxidant activities by FRAP and DPPH method, having the higher levels of phenol and flavonoid than those of plant root. The total amount of phenol and flavonoid quantified were of 21.75, 20.53 gallic acid equivalent per gram and 8.27 and 7.36 mu g/mg of quercetin equivalent respectively. These two endophytic fungi (SaR-2 and SaF-2) were found to have comparable scavenging abilities on both FRAP (1682.21 and 1659.05 mu mol/mg, respectively) and DPPH-free radicals (90.14% and 83.25%, respectively, at 0.1 mg/mL). This is the first report about isolation of endophytic fungi from S. miltiorrhiza Bge. f. alba and their antioxidant activities. Conclusions: These results indicate that the endophytic fungi associated with S. miltiorrhiza Bge.f. alba can be a potential source of novel natural antioxidants.","J","Li, YL; Xin, XM; Chang, ZY; Shi, RJ; Miao, ZM; Ding, J; Hao, GP",NA,"","","Li, Yan-Ling; Xin, Xiao-Ming; Chang, Zheng-Yao; Shi, Ren-Jiu; Miao, Zeng-Min; Ding, Jing; Hao, Gang-Ping",NA,NA,"The endophytic fungi of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge.f. alba are a potential source of natural antioxidants","BOTANICAL STUDIES","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1999-3110","",NA,NA,"APR 1",2015,56,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","5","10.1186/s40529-015-0086-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40529-015-0086-6","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28510814,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000355400600001","View Full Record in Web of Science",24,"Presence"
"Many medicinal plants possess antimicrobial activities, and have antagonistic endophytic fungi that help them protect from pathogen attack. The aim of this study was to examine endophytic fungi in traditional Chinese medicinal plants, and understand if these organisms have antimicrobial activities and they can be potentially used for biological control of plant diseases. A total of 208 endophytic fungal isolates were collected from stems (83), leaves (121) and flowers (4) of 26 medicinal plant species. The majority of the isolates belonged to Alternaria, Phomopsis, Colletotrichum, Phoma and Acremonium as well as several species allocated to Mycelia sterilia. A detached leaf assay was conducted by testing these isolates on wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, or Bgt). Fifteen isolates of endophytic fungi inhibited Bgt, exhibiting control efficacies ranging from 65.4% to 100%. Of these isolates, LPS-1, SCS-6 and 16-6, exhibited significant inhibition of Bgt proliferation (>90%). Isolate LPS-1 isolated from the stem of Ilex cornuta Lindl. ex Paxt. had the highest efficacy, resulting in 100% inhibition of Bgt growth on detached leaf segments. Based on morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analyses of the ITS rDNA sequences and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF-1 alpha) gene regions, LPS-1 was identified as Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae. A range of culture conditions for LPS-1 were examined and the results indicated that optimal antifungal activity resulted from static cultures in PDB (pH 7.0) inoculated with three mycelial plugs and incubated at 30 degrees C for 6 days. With further study, LPS-1 can be a candidate for biological control. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Background: Endophytic fungi, which have been reported in numerous plant species, are important components of the forest community and contribute significantly to the diversity of natural ecosystems. Objectives: The current study aimed to evaluate and characterize, at the molecular level, the diversity and antimicrobial activities of endophytic fungi from medicinal plants in Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: Fungi growing on plant segments were isolated and identified based on morphological and molecular characteristics. The isolates were grouped into 35 distinct operational taxonomic units, based on the sequence of the internal transcribed spacer regions in the rRNA gene. The colonization frequency and the dominant fungi percentage of these endophytic fungi were calculated. A dual culture technique was adopted to investigate the antifungal activity of these endophytes. Results: Tamarix nilotica showed the highest endophytic diversity with a relative frequency of 27.27%, followed by Cressa cretica with a relative frequency of 19.27%. The most frequently isolated species was Penicillium chrysogenum with an overall colonization rate of 98.57%. Seven out of 35 endophytic fungi exhibited strong antifungal activity to all plant fungal pathogens tested. P. chrysogenum, Fusarium oxysporum, and F. nygamai exhibited the highest inhibition against the human pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Aspergillus sydowii, P. chrysogenum, and Eupenicillium crustaceum showed strong antimicrobial activity against Enterococcus faecalis. Conclusions: The antimicrobial activity of these endophytic microorganisms could be exploited in biotechnology, medicine, and agriculture.","J","Gashgari, R; Gherbawy, Y; Ameen, F; Alsharari, S",NA,"","","Gashgari, Rukaia; Gherbawy, Youssuf; Ameen, Fuad; Alsharari, Salam",NA,NA,"Molecular Characterization and Analysis of Antimicrobial Activity of Endophytic Fungi From Medicinal Plants in Saudi Arabia","JUNDISHAPUR JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gherbawy, Youssuf/K-5692-2019; Ameen, Fuad/N-8881-2017","Gherbawy, Youssuf/0000-0003-3347-7908; Ameen, Fuad/0000-0002-5185-022X; AlSharari, Salam/0000-0001-7206-823X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2008-3645","2008-4161","",NA,NA,"JAN",2016,9,"1",NA,"","",NA,"","","e26157","10.5812/jjm.26157","http://dx.doi.org/10.5812/jjm.26157","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27099679,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000373926600003","View Full Record in Web of Science",26,"Presence"
"Coffee endophytes have been studied for almost 74 years, and several studies have demonstrated coffee-endophytic fungi with antibacterial and antifungal potential for human and plant pathogens. In this study, we isolated and identified a total of 235 strains of endophytic fungi from coffee leaf tissues collected in four coffee plantations in Pu'er city, Yunnan province, China. Molecular identification was carried out using maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2) sequences, while the colonization rate and the isolation frequency were also calculated. Two pathogenic fungi (Alternaria alternata and Penicillium digitatum) and two pathogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas syringae and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica) were used for screening the antagonistic activities of 61 strains of coffee-endophytic fungi by a dual-culture test assay while maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis confirmed their natural classification. This is the first study of coffee-leaf-endophytic fungal diversity in China, and the results revealed that coffee-endophytic fungi from this study belong to the Ascomycota, distributed among two classes, 10 orders, and 17 families. Concurrently, endophytic fungi isolates distributed in Arthrinium, Biscogniauxia, Daldinia, Diaporthe, and Nigrospora showed strong antagonistic activities against the pathogens. For the pathogens Alternaria alternata and Pseudomonas syringae, Nigrospora XCE-7 showed the best inhibitory effects with inhibition rates of 71.76% and 61.11%, respectively. For the pathogen Penicillium digitatum, Daldinia ME-9 showed the best inhibitory effect with a 74.67% inhibition rate, while Biscogniauxia PTE-7 and Daldinia T5E-1-3 showed the best inhibitory effect with a rate of 60.42% against the pathogen Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica. Overall, our study shows the diversity of coffee endophytes in four coffee-growing areas in Pu'er city, Yunnan province, China, and their potential use as biological control agents against two fungal and two bacterial pathogens.","J","Lu, L; Karunarathna, SC; Hyde, KD; Suwannarach, N; Elgorban, AM; Stephenson, SL; Al-Rejaie, S; Jayawardena, RS; Tibpromma, S",NA,"","","Lu, Li; Karunarathna, Samantha C.; Hyde, Kevin D.; Suwannarach, Nakarin; Elgorban, Abdallah M.; Stephenson, Steven L.; Al-Rejaie, Salim; Jayawardena, Ruvishika S.; Tibpromma, Saowaluck",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungi Associated with Coffee Leaves in China Exhibited In Vitro Antagonism against Fungal and Bacterial Pathogens","JOURNAL OF FUNGI","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Suwannarach, Nakarin/P-6078-2019; Karunarathna, Samantha Chandranath/JCE-5110-2023; Jayawardena, Ruvishika/V-3592-2018; Hyde, Kevin D/F-7890-2010; Elgorban, Abdallah M./C-6000-2013","Suwannarach, Nakarin/0000-0002-2653-1913; Jayawardena, Ruvishika/0000-0001-7702-4885; Elgorban, Abdallah M./0000-0003-3664-7853; Tibpromma, Saowaluck/0000-0002-4706-6547; lu, li/0000-0003-0977-6414; Karunarathna, Samantha Chandranath/0000-0001-7080-0781",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2309-608X","",NA,NA,"JUL",2022,8,"7",NA,"","",NA,"","","698","10.3390/jof8070698","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof8070698","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35887454,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000831379800001","View Full Record in Web of Science",27,"Presence"
"To know more about the potential roles of endophytic fungi in the formation mechanism of Daodi medicinal material, diversity and communities of culturable endophytic fungi in three types of tree peonies were investigated. Endophytic fungi of three types of tree peonies were isolated and identified. The diversity was analyzed. Bayesian trees constructed by MrBayes 3.2.6 after phylogenetic analysis of the ITS sequences. The endophytic fungi potential for synthesis of natural products was assessed by means of detecting NRPS and PKS gene sequences. In total, 364 endophytic fungi isolates representing 26 genera were recovered from Paeonia ostii 'Feng Dan', Paeonia ostii 'Luoyang Feng Dan', and Paeonia suffruticosa 'Luoyang Hong'. More culturable endophytic fungi appeared in P. suffruticosa 'Luoyang Hong' (206) compared with P. ostii 'Feng Dan' (60) and P. ostii 'Luoyang Feng Dan' (98). The fungal community of P. ostii 'Feng Dan' had the highest richness and diversity. PKSs and NRPS detection rates of endophytic fungi from P. ostii 'Feng Dan' are both the highest among the three types of tree peonies.

"Different endophytic fungi isolated from Himalayan Yew plants were tested for their ability to produce taxol. The BAPT gene (C-13 phenylpropanoid side chain-CoA acetyl transferase) involved in the taxol biosynthetic pathway was used as a molecular marker to screen taxol-producing endophytic fungi. Taxol extracted from fungal strain TBPJ-B was identified by HPLC and MS analysis. Strain TBPJ-B was identified as Fusarium redolens based on the morphology and internal transcribed spacer region of nrDNA analysis. HPLC quantification of fungal taxol showed that F. redolens was capable of producing 66 mu g/l of taxol in fermentation broth. The antitumour activity of the fungal taxol was tested by potato disc tumor induction assay using Agrobacterium tumefaciens as the tumor induction agent. The present study results showed that PCR amplification of genes involved in taxol biosynthesis is an efficient and reliable method for prescreening taxol-producing fungi. We are reporting for the first time the production of taxol by F. redolens from Taxus baccata L. subsp. wallichiana (Zucc.) Pilger.

"IntroductionAltitude, as a comprehensive ecological factor, regulates the growth and development of plants and microbial distribution. Dendrobium nobile (D. nobile) planted in habitats at different elevations in Chishui city, also shows metabolic differences and endophytes diversity. What is the triangular relationship between altitude, endophytes, and metabolites? MethodsIn this study, the diversity and species of endophytic fungi were tested by ITS sequencing and metabolic differences in plants were tested by UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Elevation regulated the colonization of plant endophytic fungal species and fatty acid metabolites in D. nobile. ResultsThe results indicate that and high altitude was better for the accumulation of fatty acid metabolites. Therefore, the high-altitude characteristic endophytic floras were screened, and the correlation with fatty acid metabolites of plants was built. The colonization of T. rubrigenum, P. Incertae sedis unclassified, Phoma. cf. nebulosa JZG 2008 and Basidiomycota unclassified showed a significantly positive correlation with fatty acid metabolites, especially 18-carbon-chain fatty acids, such as (6Z,9Z,12Z)-octadeca-6,9,12-trienoic acid, 3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-12-oxohexadeca-2,4-dienoic acid and Octadec-9-en-12-ynoic acid. What is more fascinating is these fatty acids are the essential substrates of plant hormones.

"Endophytic fungi from orchid plants are reported to secrete secondary metabolites which include bioactive antimicrobial siderophores. In this study endophytic fungi capable of secreting siderophores were isolated from Cymbidium aloifolium, a medicinal orchid plant. The isolated extracellular siderophores from orchidaceous fungi act as chelating agents forming soluble complexes with Fe3+. The 60% endophytic fungi of Cymbidium aloifolium produced hydroxamate siderophore on CAS agar. The highest siderophore percentage was 57% in Penicillium chrysogenum (CAL1), 49% in Aspergillus sydowii (CAR12), 46% in Aspergillus terreus (CAR14) by CAS liquid assay. The optimum culture parameters for siderophore production were 30 degrees C, pH 6.5, maltose and ammonium nitrate and the highest resulting siderophore content was 73% in P. chrysogenum. The total protein content of solvent-purified siderophore increased four-fold compared with crude filtrate. The percent Fe3+ scavenged was detected by atomic absorption spectra analysis and the highest scavenging value was 83% by P. chrysogenum. Thin layer chromatography of purified P. chrysogenum siderophore showed a wine-colored spot with R-f value of 0.54. HPLC peaks with R(t)s of 10.5 and 12.5 min were obtained for iron-free and iron-bound P. chrysogenum siderophore, respectively. The iron-free P. chrysogenum siderophore revealed an exact mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 400.46 and iron-bound P. chrysogenum siderophore revealed a m/z of 453.35. The solvent-extracted siderophores inhibited the virulent plant pathogens Ralstonia solanacearum, that causes bacterial wilt in groundnut and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae which causes bacterial blight disease in rice. Thus, bioactive siderophore-producing endophytic P. chrysogenum can be exploited in the form of formulations for development of resistance against other phytopathogens in crop plants.","J","Chowdappa, S; Jagannath, S; Konappa, N; Udayashankar, AC; Jogaiah, S",NA,"","","Chowdappa, Srinivas; Jagannath, Shubha; Konappa, Narasimhamurthy; Udayashankar, Arakere C.; Jogaiah, Sudisha",NA,NA,"Detection and Characterization of Antibacterial Siderophores Secreted by Endophytic Fungi from Cymbidium aloifolium","BIOMOLECULES","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Jogaiah, Sudisha/ABE-8334-2021","Jogaiah, Sudisha/0000-0003-2831-651X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2218-273X","",NA,NA,"OCT",2020,10,"10",NA,"","",NA,"","","1412","10.3390/biom10101412","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biom10101412","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33036284,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000584218200001","View Full Record in Web of Science",35,"Presence"

"Liverwort secondary metabolites play an important role in the peaceful relationship between liverwort endophytic fungi and the host. This study identified potential antifungal agents based on interactions between host plants and endophytic fungi. Two endophytic fungi strains and 25 metabolites, including nine new compounds, were isolated from the Chinese liverwort Herbertus herpocladioides. Endophytic fungi were identified using internal transcribed spacer and whole-genome sequencing, and the compound structures were determined using comprehensive spectroscopic analysis coupled with electronic circular dichroism calculations. Among these compounds, compounds 10-13 exhibited potent antifungal activities. Compound 10, the most potent antifungal agent, disrupted fungal mitochondrial respiration by inhibiting the activity of mitochondrial complexes I and IV and resulted in the intracellular ATP content of endophytic fungi being significantly reduced.

"Cotton plants were sampled and ranked according to their resistance to Verticillium wilt. In total, 642 endophytic fungi isolates representing 27 genera were recovered from Gossypium hirsutum root, stem, and leaf tissues, but were not uniformly distributed. More endophytic fungi appeared in the leaf (391) compared with the root (140) and stem (111) sections. However, no significant difference in the abundance of isolated endophytes was found among resistant cotton varieties. Alternaria exhibited the highest colonization frequency (7.9%), followed by Acremonium (6.6%) and Penicillium (4.8%). Unlike tolerant varieties, resistant and susceptible ones had similar endophytic fungal population compositions. In three Verticillium-wilt-resistant cotton varieties, fungal endophytes from the genus Alternaria were most frequently isolated, followed by Gibberella and Penicillium. The maximum concentration of dominant endophytic fungi was observed in leaf tissues (0.1797). The evenness of stem tissue endophytic communities (0.702) was comparatively more uniform than the other two tissues. Eighty endophytic fungi selected from 27 genera were evaluated for their inhibition activity against highly virulent Verticillium dahliae isolate Vd080 in vitro. Thirty-nine isolates exhibited fungistasis against the pathogen at varying degrees. Seven species, having high growth inhibition rates (>= 75%), exhibited strong antifungal activity against V. dahliae. The antifungal activity of both volatile and nonvolatile metabolites was also investigated. The nonvolatile substances produced by CEF-818 (Penicillium simplicissimum), CEF-325 (Fusarium solani), CEF-714 (Leptosphaeria sp.), and CEF-642 (Talaromyces flavus) completely inhibited V. dahliae growth.

"The bioprospecting of secondary metabolites from endophytic fungi received great attention in the 1990s and 2000s, when the controversy around taxol production from Taxus spp. endophytes was at its height. Since then, hundreds of reports have described the isolation and characterization of putative secondary metabolites from endophytic fungi. However, only very few studies also report the genetic basis for these phenotypic observations. With low sequencing cost and fast sample turnaround, genetics- and genomics-based approaches have risen to become comprehensive approaches to study natural products from a wide-range of organisms, especially to elucidate underlying biosynthetic pathways. However, in the field of fungal endophyte biology, elucidation of biosynthetic pathways is still a major challenge. As a relatively poorly investigated group of microorganisms, even in the light of recent efforts to sequence more fungal genomes, such as the 1000 Fungal Genomes Project at the Joint Genome Institute (JGI), the basis for bioprospecting of enzymes and pathways from endophytic fungi is still rather slim. In this review we want to discuss the current approaches and tools used to associate phenotype and genotype to elucidate biosynthetic pathways of secondary metabolites in endophytic fungi through the lens of bioprospecting. This review will point out the reported successes and shortcomings, and discuss future directions in sampling, and genetics and genomics of endophytic fungi. Identifying responsible biosynthetic genes for the numerous secondary metabolites isolated from endophytic fungi opens the opportunity to explore the genetic potential of producer strains to discover novel secondary metabolites and enhance secondary metabolite production by metabolic engineering resulting in novel and more affordable medicines and food additives.","J","Sagita, R; Quax, WJ; Haslinger, K",NA,"","","Sagita, Rosa; Quax, Wim J.; Haslinger, Kristina",NA,NA,"Current State and Future Directions of Genetics and Genomics of Endophytic Fungi for Bioprospecting Efforts","FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Haslinger, Kristina/ABC-1310-2020; Quax, Wim/K-2802-2012","Haslinger, Kristina/0000-0003-1361-1508; Quax, Wim/0000-0002-5162-9947",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2296-4185","","",NA,NA,"MAR 15",2021,9,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","649906","10.3389/fbioe.2021.649906","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2021.649906","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33791289,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000634274300001","View Full Record in Web of Science",39,"Review"

"In this study, we firstly reported the large-scale screening and isolation of endophytic fungi from nine wild and six cultivated soybeans in the cold regions of China. We totally isolated 302 endophytic fungal strains, of which 215 strains are isolated from the wild soybeans and 87 are identified from cultivated soybeans. Among these endophytic fungal strains, in the roots, stems, and leaves, 24.17% were isolated from roots, 28.8% were isolated from stems, and 47.01% were isolated from leaves, respectively. Most endophytic fungal strains isolated from the wild soybean roots were the species of Fusarium genus, and the fungal strains in the stems were the species of ascomycetes and Fusarium fungi, whereas most strains in the leaves were Alternaria fungi. To analyze the taxonomy of the obtained samples, we sequenced and compared their rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. The data showed that 6 strains are putatively novel strains exhibiting <= 97% homology with the known strains. We next measured the secondary metabolites produced by the different strains and we found 11 strains exhibited high-performance synthesis of triterpenoids, phenols, and polysaccharides. Furthermore, we characterized their tolerance to abiotic stresses. The results indicated that 4 strains exhibited high tolerance to cadmium, and some strains exhibited resistance to acid, and alkali.

"Shifting the drug discovery from plants to microorganisms due to minimizing the ecological effects has led to the increasing work on finding bioactive metabolites from endophytic fungi, especially those isolated from medicinal plants growing in arid and semi-arid land. An endophytic fungi Alternaria sp. isolated from dry land was cultivated on solid rice media and then extracted with ethyl acetate. From the fungal ethyl acetate crude extract of Alternaria sp., compounds altertoxin I (1) and II (2), and stemphyltoxin III (3), were isolated based on the bioactivity assay. The structures of compounds 1-3 were identified using UV, NMR, and mass spectral data and compared to those spectral data reported in the literature. The absolute configuration was determined to be the same as the previous report based on the comparison with the optical rotation value. The three compounds showed strong cytotoxic activity, with altertoxin II being the most active ones having the inhibition of growth observed at 94.4% against murine lymphoma L5178Y cell line at 10 mu g/mL.

"Medicines derived mostly from natural sources have played a major role in cancer chemotherapy for over 50 years. Against numerous ailments, plants have served as a source of bioactive compounds for centuries. However, it is not the plants themselves, but the microorganisms associated with them that offer material and products with high therapeutic potential. Endophytes are organisms that colonize internal plant tissues without causing disease symptoms. They constitute an endosymbiotic group of microorganisms which are the source of innovative natural products for use in modern industry, agriculture and medicine, indicating potential therapeutic properties, including anti-cancer and antimicrobial, as well as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Endophytic fungi are a rich source of bioactive metabolites that can be manipulated to obtain to produce desirable the desired new analogs used in chemotherapy, including: taxol, camptothecin, podophyllotoxin, vinblastine, vincristine, cytochalasin and many others.

"Endophytic fungi of selected Nigerian plants are important sources of bioactive products with enormous potentials for the discovery of new drug molecules for drug development. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the major causes of healthcare-associated bacterial infections, leading to increased mortality and morbidity In this study, isolated endophytic fungi from Cola nitida were screened for anti-pseudomonas properties. Endophytic fungi associated with healthy leaves of C. nitida were isolated using standard methods. Fungi were identified through their morphological, cultural and microscopic characteristics. The fungi were subjected to solid-state fermentation and secondary metabolites extracted using ethyl acetate and concentrated under vacuum. The crude extracts were screened for antimicrobial activity against clinical and laboratory strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa using the agar diffusion method. The bioactive components of the fungal extracts were identified using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Diode Array Detector (HPLC-DAD) analysis. Three endophytic fungi; Acremonium sp., Aspergillus sp. and Trichophyton sp. were isolated. At 1 mg/ml, extracts of the three fungi displayed antipseudomonal activity with inhibition zone diameter ranging from 6 - 4 mm. HPLC-DAD analysis revealed the presence of compounds, such as 4-hydroxyphenyl acetate. indole-3-acetic acid, and protocatechuic acid among others in the fungal extracts. The findings in this study reveal that endophytic fungi associated with C. nitida possess promising antipseudomonal properties.

"Endophytic fungi play an important role in terrestrial ecosystem, while little is known about those in hemi-parasitic plants, a group of special plants which absorb nutrients from its hosts by haustoria. The relationship of the endophytes in the two parts of the bipartite systems (hemiparasites together with their hosts) is also poorly understood. Endophytic fungi of a hemi-parasitic plant Macrosolen tricolor, and its host plant Camellia oleifera were investigated and compared in this study. M. tricolor contained rich and diversified endophytic fungi (H' = 2.829), which consisted mainly of ascomycetes, distributed in more than ten orders of four classes (Sordariomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Leotiomycetes and Eurotiomycetes) besides Incertae sedis strains (23.2 % of total). In addition, 2.2 % of isolates were identified to be Basidiomycota, all of which belonged to Agaricomycetes. Obvious differences were observed between the endophytic fungal assembles in the leaves and those in the branches of M. tricolor. The endophytic fungi isolated from C. oleifera distributed in nearly same orders of the four classes of Ascomycota and one class (Agaricomycetes) of Basidiomycota as those from M. tricolor with similar proportion. For both M. tricolor and C. oleifera, Valsa sp. was the dominant endophyte species in the leaves, Torula sp. 1 and Fusarium sp. 1 were the dominant endophytic fungi in the branches. The similarity coefficient of the endophyte assembles in the two host was 64.4 %. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that the endophyte assembles of M. tricolor and C. oleifera were significantly different (p < 0.01).","J","Zhou, SL; Yan, SZ; Wu, ZY; Chen, SL",NA,"","","Zhou Sheng-Liang; Yan Shu-Zhen; Wu Zhen-Ying; Chen Shuang-Lin",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi associated with Macrosolen tricolor and its host Camellia oleifera","WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0959-3993","1573-0972","",NA,NA,"JUN",2014,30,"6",NA,"","",NA,"1775","1784","","10.1007/s11274-014-1600-9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-014-1600-9","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24442818,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000338136800010","View Full Record in Web of Science",49,"Presence"
"Background: Endophytic fungi represent underexplored resource of novel lead compounds and have a capacity to produce diverse class of plant secondary metabolites. Here we investigated endophytic fungi diversity and screening of paclitaxel-producing fungi from Taxus x media. Results: Eighty-one endophytic fungi isolated from T. media were grouped into 8 genera based on the morphological and molecular identification. Guignardia and Colletotrichum were the dominant genera, whereas the remaining genera were infrequent groups. The genera Glomerella and Gibberella were first reported in Taxus. Three representative species of the distinct genera gave positive hits by molecular marker screening and were capable of producing taxol which were validated by HPLC-MS. Among these 3 taxol-producing fungi, the highest yield of taxol was 720 ng/l by Guignardia mangiferae HAA11 compared with those of Fusarium proliferatum HBA29 (240 ng/l) and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides TA67 (120 ng/l). This is the first report of taxol producer from Guignardia. Moreover, the lower similarities of ts and bapt between microbial and plant origin suggested that fungal taxol biosynthetic cluster might be repeatedly invented during evolution, nor horizontal gene transfer from Taxus species. Conclusions: Taxol-producing endophytic fungi could be a fascinating reservoir to generate taxol-related drug lead and to elucidate the remained 5 unknown genes or the potential regulation mechanism in the taxol biosynthesis pathway.","J","Xiong, ZQ; Yang, YY; Zhao, N; Wang, Y",NA,"","","Xiong, Zhi-Qiang; Yang, Ying-Ying; Zhao, Na; Wang, Yong",NA,NA,"Diversity of endophytic fungi and screening of fungal paclitaxel producer from Anglojap yew, Taxus x media","BMC MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Xiong, Zhi-Qiang/0000-0002-7984-3662",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1471-2180","","",NA,NA,"MAR 28",2013,13,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","71","10.1186/1471-2180-13-71","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2180-13-71","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,23537181,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000317132300001","View Full Record in Web of Science",50,"Presence"

Therefore, we analyzed the endophytic fungal community of SB and screened the endophytic fungi that might promote flavonoid synthesis in SB. ITS1/ITS4Blast was used to identify the endophytic fungi in SB. In total, 687 strains were identified in 57 genera. The dominant genus in the leaves and stems was Alternaria and that in the roots was Fusarium. Alternaria was the dominant genus in SB collected from all sites and in wild and cultivated SB. Alpha diversity indexes indicated more abundant endophytic fungi in samples from Chengde, the genuine producing area of SB, than in those from other sites. Beta diversity index analysis indicated that SB plants with closer geographical relationships showed more similar endophytic fungal community profiles. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that baicalin, wogonoside, wogonin, and oroxylin A contents were significantly correlated with the relative abundance of Alternaria. Overall, the results indicate the importance of geographical factors in influencing the endophytic fungal community of SB and suggest that the presence of Alternaria spp. might contribute to flavonoid synthesis in SB.","J","Cui, XX; Wang, L; Fang, HY; Zheng, YG; Su, CY",NA,"","","Cui, Xiao-Xuan; Wang, Lei; Fang, Hui-Yong; Zheng, Yu-Guang; Su, Chun-Yan",NA,NA,"The cultivable endophytic fungal community of Scutellaria baicalensis: diversity and relevance to flavonoid production by the host","PLANT SIGNALING & BEHAVIOR","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1559-2316","1559-2324","",NA,NA,"DEC 31",2022,17,"1",NA,"","",NA,"","","","10.1080/15592324.2022.2068834","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2022.2068834","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35531979,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000792012000001","View Full Record in Web of Science",54,"Presence"

"The vast biodiversity of endophytic fungi and its potential to improve the production of bioactive metabolites in host plants has attracted intense research of endophytic fungi. However, extensive research is needed to explore in detail the interaction between specific endophytic fungi, host physiological responses and changes to plant secondary metabolites. The present work shows that an endophytic fungus Trichoderma atroviride D16 can promote the accumulation of tanshinones in the root of S. miltiorrhiza, and also can induce the production of abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA) in the root of S. miltiorrhiza. Pre-treatment of plantlets with biosynthetic inhibitors of ABA or SA blocked the endophytic fungi-induced tanshinones production. ABA inhibitors not only inhibited the accumulation of tanshinones induced by endophytic fungi, but also inhibited the production of ABA and SA; However, SA inhibitors have no obvious inhibition on the biosynthesis of induced ABA, which means that SA plays a role in the downstream of ABA production. These results confirmed that exogenous ABA and SA can reversed the inhibition in the inhibitors on the accumulation of tanshinones induced by endophytic fungi. Endophytic fungi, ABA and SA treatments also significantly increased the transcriptional activity of genes in the tanshinone biosynthesis pathway, the main pathway for endophytic fungi to induce the synthesis of tanshinones was found to be the mevalonate pathway. These results indicate that T. atroviride D16, as an endogenous elicitor, stimulates the biosynthesis of tanshinones in the root of S. miltiorrhiza, thereby yielding additional insight into the interconnection between ABA and SA in biosynthesis-related signaling pathways.","J","Xie, XG; Sheng, KX; Lu, WL; Wang, HR; Rahman, K; Feng, KM; Han, T",NA,"","","Xie, Xing-Guang; Sheng, Ke-Xin; Lu, Wei-Lan; Wang, Hao-Ran; Rahman, Khalid; Feng, Kun-Miao; Han, Ting",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungus Trichoderma atroviride D16 increases tanshinone accumulation in Salvia miltiorrhiza plantlets by enhancing abscisic acid and salicylic acid signaling","SYMBIOSIS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0334-5114","1878-7665","",NA,NA,"JUN",2023,90,"2",NA,"","",NA,"171","181","","10.1007/s13199-023-00927-7","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-023-00927-7","","JUL 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001034382400001","View Full Record in Web of Science",57,"Presence"
"Some grasses harbor endophytic fungi living in intercellular spaces in the leaves, stems and reproductive organs. The fungi can dramatically affect the physiology and ecology of plants. For example, fungi may produce toxins that deter herbivores and they may alter the water status of the plant to increase drought tolerance. The distribution of fungal infection in natural plant populations is unknown for mana host species. We investigated the occurrence of endophytic fungi in Elymus canadensis L, (Canada wild rye) from 13 remnant prairie sites in the midwest and 23 sites in the southern Great Plains. Collections of plant tissue came from Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Illinois, Oklahoma, and Texas. All midwest plants were grown in a common garden site in eastern Nebraska. Seeds collected from Oklahoma and Texas accessions were planted in the greenhouse. At least 3 tillers from 2 plants of each accession were screened for endophytes, using light microscopy. The endophytic fungus was found in seed of all accessions and in plants from all but 4 accessions. The functional significance of the fungus is unclear, but it may affect plants by enhancing productivity or deterring herbivores. The widespread occurrence of endophytic fungi in natural populations of E, canadensis suggests that the plant-fungal association may be long-standing and important in the evolution and success of this native prairie species.","J","Vinton, MA; Kathol, ES; Vogel, KP; Hopkins, AA",NA,"","","Vinton, MA; Kathol, ES; Vogel, KP; Hopkins, AA",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi in Canada wild rye in natural grasslands","JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0022-409X","","",NA,NA,"JUL",2001,54,"4",NA,"","",NA,"390","395","","10.2307/4003108","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4003108","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000169679200011","View Full Record in Web of Science",58,"Presence"

A total of 158 endophytic fungal stains were isolated from 1088 tissue segments of 12 samples, and 28 taxa represented by 25 species and 15 genera were identified as Ascomycetes. Alternaria sp. was the dominant genus with generic abundance ranging from 20% to 65%. The colonization rate of root was significantly lower, but the root-endophytic fungi (19 species) conversely presented a higher diversity than stem and leaf (11 and 7 species, respectively). Endophytic fungi had pronounced relative host and tissue preferences, while tissue explained more endophytic fungal variation than plant species. Additionally, soil pH, organic carbon, and phosphatase elicited significant responses from fungal species, which significantly affected the species richness of Fusarium redolens, Alternaria chlamydospore, Didymella glomerata, and Xylariales sp. This research provides a basis for the further understanding of the ecological distribution of endophytic fungi associated with xerophytic plants and their potential application for vegetative restoration and agricultural cultivation in drylands.","J","Zuo, YL; Hu, QN; Zhang, KX; He, XL",NA,"","","Zuo, Yiling; Hu, Qiannan; Zhang, Kaixun; He, Xueli",NA,NA,"Host and Tissue Affiliations of Culturable Endophytic Fungi Associated with Xerophytic Plants in the Desert Region of Northwest China","AGRONOMY-BASEL","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hu, Qian/GWZ-7617-2022","he, Xueli/0000-0002-2783-3390",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2073-4395","",NA,NA,"MAR",2022,12,"3",NA,"","",NA,"","","727","10.3390/agronomy12030727","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12030727","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000775506700001","View Full Record in Web of Science",59,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi were isolated from healthy tissues of Lippia sidoides Cham. (Verbenaceae), a medicinal plant used as an antiseptic in the northeast of Brazil. From 480 fragments of leaves (240) and stems (240), a total of 203 endophytic fungi were isolated, representing 14 species belonging to the groups Ascomycota, Coelomycetes and Hyphomycetes. Endophytic colonization was greater in leaves (50.4%) than in stems (35.4%). Colletotrichum gloeosporiodes had the maximum colonization frequency (12.3%), followed by Alternaria alternata (7.08%), Guignardia bidwelli (6.87%) and Phomopsis archeri (5.41%). Some species showed specificity for the host tissue: Curvularia pallescens, Dreschlera dematioidea, G. bidwellii, Microascus desmosporum, Peacilomyces variotti, Periconia byssoides and Ulocladium oudemansii were only isolated from leaves while Fusarium lateritium and Phoma tracheiphila were only isolated from stems. Through a preliminary screening and fermentation assay, 16 isolates where found to produce antimicrobial metabolites against bacterial and fungi. The diversity and role of endophytes in medicinal plants is briefly discussed.

"Meliaceae plants are found worldwide in tropical or subtropical climates. They are important ethnobotanically as sources of traditional medicine, with 575 species and 51 genera. Previous research found that microorganisms are plant pioneers to produce secondary metabolites with diverse compound structures and bioactivities. Several plants of the Meliaceae family contain secondary metabolites isolated from endophytic fungi. Furthermore, related articles from 2002 to 2022 were collected from SciFinder, Google Scholar, and PubMed. About 276 compounds were isolated from endophytic fungi such as terpenoids, polyketides, lactones, pyrones, quinone, anthraquinones, xanthones, coumarines, isocoumarines, resorcylic acid lactones, cytochalasins, aromatics, ester, quinols, alkaloids, nitro compound, fatty acids, and sugars with bioactivities such as antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, anti-influenza, neuroprotective activities, anti-HIV, cytotoxic, allelopathic, anti-inflammatory, antifeedant effects, and BSLT toxicity.

"Background Endophytic fungi are diverse and ubiquitous in nature, yet studies simultaneously comparing endophyte communities in above- and below-ground plant tissues are relatively scarce. The main goal of our study was to compare the diversity and community composition of endophytic fungi associated with above- and below-ground tissues of the plant Aristolochia chilensis in an arid ecosystem. Endophytic fungi were isolated from healthy leaves and roots of A. chilensis, and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was sequenced for phylogenetic and taxonomic analysis. Results A combined total of 457 fungal isolates were cultured from leaf and root tissues, belonging to 54 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The genera Fusarium, Penicillium, Phialemonium and Trichoderma were the most representative endophyte taxa identified in A. chilensis tissues; nevertheless, Fusarium was significantly more dominant in the below-ground community, while foliar endophyte community was dominated by Penicillium. Whereas OTU richness and diversity were not different between below-ground and above-ground tissues, endophyte abundance was on average twice as high in below-ground tissue than in above-ground tissue. Fungal endophyte communities in the two tissue types were significantly dissimilar. Conclusions Results from this study indicate that A. chilensis harbors a similar diversity of endophytic fungi in above- and below-ground tissues. Dominant endophytic fungi were found to be dependent on tissue type, which potentially resulted in marked differences in community structure between above- and below-ground tissues. Ecological processes potentially affecting this pattern are discussed.","J","Guevara-Araya, MJ; Vilo, C; Urzúa, A; González-Teuber, M",NA,"","","Guevara-Araya, M.

"Plant roots are inhabited by a diversity of microorganisms known to be key drivers of plant growth and health. Although the rules governing root microbiota assembly have been investigated and the importance of abiotic determinants highlighted, the consequences of the biotic context of the plant community have often been overlooked. We tested the hypothesis that the abundance of species in a given plant neighborhood could leave a fingerprint on its root-endophytic fungal community, ultimately impacting its biomass. Outdoor experimental mesocosms, comprising a range of floristic compositions and spatially mapped plant distributions, were monitored for 2y. Medicago truncatula was used as trap-plant and grown under standardized conditions on soil samples collected in the mesocosms. The root-endophytic fungal community of M. truncatula was described by amplicon mass sequencing and M. truncatula performance was also assessed. The richness and evenness of M. truncatula's root-endophytic fungal community were explained by the small-scale plant neighborhood of the soil samples. For instance, the occurrence of Brachypodium pinnatum in the neighborhood induced higher and lower richness of Sordariomycetes and Glomeromycetes, respectively, whereas Holcus mollis decreased the OTU evenness of the entire mycobiota. These changes in fungal Glade OTU richness and evenness were related to modifications in the biomass of M. truncatula. These results indicate that a given plant endophytic fungal community is determined in part by the neighboring plants. Considering that changes in endophytic fungal community are correlated with the plant biomass, this suggests that plant-plant interactions (i.e. competition, facilitation) impacting plant biomass can be mediated by endophytic fungal community changes.

"Guava (Syzygium aqueum), a typical Indonesian crop plant, has diuretic properties. Plants used as diuretic medicines can also be valuable sources for endophytic fungi containing diuretic drugs. The aims of this study were to isolate and identify endophytic fungi from S. aqueum stems, to isolate their secondary metabolites, and to conduct in vivo tests of the diuretic activity of an endophytic fungus extract on white male rats of the Wistar strain. Endophytic fungi were isolated by a direct plating method, and fungal isolates were identified molecularly. A phenolic compound was isolated by chromatography, and the chemical structure was identified spectroscopically. Doses of 100, 200, and 300 mg/kg BW were administered to white male rats divided into six groups (normal control, negative control, positive control, and the three treatment groups). Diuretic tests included urine volume; sodium, chloride, and calcium electrolyte levels; and pH. Phylogenetic analysis identified the endophytic fungal isolate as Trichoderma ghanense (isolation code SA1). The secondary metabolite isolated from the T. ghanense extract was a phenolic compound. Diuretic tests using the endophytic fungus extract showed the highest urine volume with a dose of 300 mg/kg BW. The diuretic test results showed an increase in urine volume and levels of sodium, potassium, and chloride ions in the urine. The extract of T. ghanense isolated from the stem of S. aqueum has the potential as initial therapy for hypertension because it contains phenolic secondary metabolites that show diuretic activity.","J","Habisukan, UH; Elfita; Widjajanti, H; Setiawan, A; Salni; Oktiansyah, R",NA,"","","Habisukan, Ummi H.; Elfita; Widjajanti, Hary; Setiawan, Arum; Salni; Oktiansyah, Rian",NA,NA,"A Phenolic Compound of Endophytic Fungi Isolated from Stem of Syzygium aqueum and its Diuretic Activity","BIOINTERFACE RESEARCH IN APPLIED CHEMISTRY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"setiawan, arum/HJJ-1201-2023","setiawan, arum/0000-0001-6024-1090; Widjajanti, Hary/0000-0001-5555-1537; , salni/0000-0002-5509-7917; Oktiansyah, Rian/0000-0002-4747-396X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2069-5837","","",NA,NA,"NOV 11",2022,12,"5",NA,"","",NA,"7040","7051","","10.33263/BRIAC125.70407051","http://dx.doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC125.70407051","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000721362000033","View Full Record in Web of Science",64,"Presence"
"Traditional rice varieties, although low producers of yield, are more amenable to organic farming practices that cause less damage to the environment and human health. Improved growth and reduced disease incidence would produce higher yields, and endophytic fungi have proven to be effective in achieving these ends in wheat. With this in view, endophytic fungal assemblages of two traditional rice varieties of Sri Lanka i.e. Suwandel and Kaluheenati were evaluated for their effect on the growth and disease incidence of rice plants, because the endophytic mycoflora of these two traditional rice varieties and their effects have not been studied before. The most common and the highest occurring endophytes of both rice varieties i.e. Absidia and Cylindrocladium were tested to determine their effect on rice plant growth and the results showed that the plants inoculated with both fungal isolates showed significant increases (p <= 0.05) in plant height, fresh weight and dry weight. Twenty two endophytic fungal isolates common to both rice varieties were screened using dual culture assay for their ability to control the mycelial growth of Magnaporthe grisea, the causative agent of rice blast disease. All tested endophytes controlled pathogen growth by coiling the hyphae around the pathogen and forming clamps and loops. However, Absidia and Acremonium showed the highest growth inhibition of the pathogen (100 %) and showed an abundance of the above inhibitory structures. The effect of crude culture filtrates of thirteen endophytic fungi tested using the diffusion plate method indicated antagonistic activity against the rice pathogen. In planta tests were carried out to assess the effect of three endophytic fungi i.e. Acremonium, Absidia and Penicillium on infection by M grisea. Disease symptoms were observed only on the leaves of the rice plants grown from Penicillium inoculated seedlings and on plants used as controls sprayed with a 1 x 10(7) spores/mL suspension of the pathogen. Pre-inoculation with Acremonium and Absidia were effective in preventing infection by the blast fungus. No disease symptoms were observed in plants pre-inoculated with endophytes and in plants used as controls sprayed with a 1 x 10(5) spores/mL suspension of the pathogen. Twenty one endophytic fungi common to both rice varieties were assessed by the culture plate method in this study.","J","Atugala, DM; Deshappriya, N",NA,"","","Atugala, D.

"Epigenetic modifiers, including DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) or histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, are useful to induce the expression of otherwise dormant biosynthetic genes under standard laboratory conditions. We isolated several endophytic fungi from the medicinal plant Datura stramonium L., which produces pharmaceutically important tropane alkaloids, including scopolamine and hyoscyamine. Although none of the endophytic fungi produced the tropane alkaloids, supplementation of a DNMT inhibitor, 5-azacytidine, and/or a HDAC inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, to the culture medium induced the production of mycotoxins, including alternariol, alternariol-5-O-methyl ether, 3'-hydroxyalternariol-5-O-methyl ether, altenusin, tenuazonic acid, and altertoxin II, by the endophytic fungus Alternaria sp. This is the first report of a mycotoxin-producing endophytic fungus from the medicinal plant D. stramonium L.

This research objective is to discover active constituent of anticancer which selective in the ethyl acetate extract through cell cycle modulation of T47D cell. Identification of RL1 code endophytic fungi morphology was determined by using microscope. Secondary metabolite production was carried out through fermentation using PDB as medium during two weeks and the medium was extracted with ethyl acetate. Separate and purify method was done using TLC, TLC preparative, and liquid chromatography. Active isolate was characterized by IR, LC-MS, H-1 NMR, C-13-NMR, and DEPT. In cytotoxic assay, T47D and Vero cells were cultured in the presence of pure isolate and was evaluated by MTT assay, whereas IC50 and Selectivity Index were used as the parameters to evaluate effectivity of anticancer. Cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry and then analysed by using ModFit LT 3.0 program. Based on microscopic analysis, RL1 code of endophytic fungi is Aspergillus sp.

"Endophytic fungi are rich in orchids and have great impacts on their host plants. 53 endophytes (30 isolates from Dendrobium devonianum and 23 endophytic fungi from D. thyrsiflorum) were isolated, respectively, from roots and stems of Dendrobium species. All the fungi were identified by way of morphological and/or molecular biological methods. 30 endophytic fungi in D. devonianum were categorized into 11 taxa and 23 fungal endophytes in D. thyrsiflorum were grouped into 11 genera, respectively.

"BackgroundRevealing the relationship between plants and fungi is very important in understanding biodiversity maintenance, community stability, and ecosystem functioning. However, differences in the community and network structures of phyllosphere epiphytic and endophytic fungi are currently poorly documented. In this study, we examined epiphytic and endophytic fungal communities associated with the leaves of six mangrove species using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequences.ResultsA total of 635 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of endophytic and epiphytic fungi were obtained at a 97% sequence similarity level; they were dominated by Dothideomycetes and Tremellomycetes. Plant identity had a significant effect on the OTU richness of endophytic fungi, but not on epiphytic fungi. The community composition of epiphytic and endophytic fungi was significantly different, and plant identity had a greater effect on endophytic fungi than on epiphytic fungi. Network analysis showed that both epiphytic and endophytic network structures were characterized by significantly highly specialized and modular but lowly connected and anti-nested properties. Furthermore, the endophytic network had higher levels of specialization and modularity but lower connectance and stronger anti-nestedness than the epiphytic network.ConclusionsThis study reveals that the phyllosphere epiphytic and endophytic fungal communities differ, and plant identity has a greater effect on the endophytic fungi than on epiphytic fungi. These findings demonstrate the role of host plant identity in driving phyllosphere epiphytic and endophytic community structure.","J","Yao, H; Sun, X; He, C; Maitra, P; Li, XC; Guo, LD",NA,"","","Yao, Hui; Sun, Xiang; He, Chao; Maitra, Pulak; Li, Xing-Chun; Guo, Liang-Dong",NA,NA,"Phyllosphere epiphytic and endophytic fungal community and network structures differ in a tropical mangrove ecosystem","MICROBIOME","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sun, Xiang/J-9207-2012; Lu, Xiaomei/IUQ-2139-2023; Maitra, Pulak/HHM-2122-2022","Maitra, Pulak/0000-0001-7141-1497; sun (Sun), xiang (Xiang)/0000-0002-6875-4971; Guo, Liang-Dong/0000-0002-5203-3192",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2049-2618","","",NA,NA,"APR 9",2019,7,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","57","10.1186/s40168-019-0671-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40168-019-0671-0","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30967154,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000465446500001","View Full Record in Web of Science",69,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi are promising sources for the production of podophyllotoxin-an important anticancer compound, replacing depleted medical plants. In this study, the endophytes associated with Dysosma difformis-an ethnomedicinal plant species were isolated to explore novel sources of podophyllotoxin. Fifty-three endophytic fungi were isolated and identified by morphological observation and ITS-based rDNA sequencing, assigning them to 27 genera in 3 divisions. Fusarium was found the most prevalent genus with a colonization frequency of 11.11%, followed by Trametes (9.26%) and Penicillium (7.41%). Phylogenetic trees were constructed for the endophytic fungi community in two collection sites, Ha Giang and Lai Chau, revealing the adaptation of the species to the specific tissues and habitats. Cytotoxic activity of endophytic fungal extracts was investigated on cancer cell lines such as SK-LU-1, HL-60, and HepG2, demonstrating strong anti-cancer activity of six isolates belonging to Penicillium, Trametes, Purpureocillium, Aspergillus, and Ganoderma with IC50 value of lower than 10 mu g/mL. The presence of podophyllotoxin was indicated in Penicillium, Trametes, Aspergillus and for the first time in Purpureocillium and Ganoderma via high-performance liquid chromatography, which implied them as a potential source of this anti-cancer compound.","J","Tran, HT; Nguyen, GT; Nguyen, HHT; Tran, HT; Tran, QH; Tran, QH; Ninh, NT; Do, PT; Chu, HH; Pham, NB",NA,"","","Hoa Thi Tran; Giang Thu Nguyen; Hong Ha Thi Nguyen; Huyen Thi Tran; Quang Hong Tran; Quang Ho Tran; Ngoc Thi Ninh; Phat Tien Do; Ha Hoang Chu; Ngoc Bich Pham",NA,NA,"Isolation and Cytotoxic Potency of Endophytic Fungi Associated with Dysosma difformis, a Study for the Novel Resources of Podophyllotoxin","MYCOBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"CHU, Hoang Mau/P-1553-2019","CHU, Hoang Mau/0000-0002-8260-6369; Do, Phat/0000-0002-4227-7396; Nguyen, Thu Giang/0000-0002-6081-014X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1229-8093","2092-9323","",NA,NA,"SEP 3",2022,50,"5",NA,"","",NA,"389","398","","10.1080/12298093.2022.2126166","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/12298093.2022.2126166","","SEP 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36404896,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000862007700001","View Full Record in Web of Science",70,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungal assemblages were investigated in different leaf stages of eight species of Ericaceae (six species of Rhododendron, Enkianthus perulatus, and Pieris japonica). Guignardia sp. (anamorph: Phyllosticta sp.), Phomopsis sp., and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides were found in the leaves of all plants. The frequency of Guignardia sp. was highest in senescent leaves, while in young leaves it was lower than those of Phomopsis sp., and C. gloeosporioides. Discostroma tricellulare was isolated in high frequency from the leaves of Rhododendron obtusum. The colonization frequencies of these endophytic fungi on fallen leaves decreased as the leaves became old, while those of Pestalotiopsis, Alternaria, and others increased after the leaves fell. No significant differences were found among the compositions of endophytic fungal assemblages on ericaceous plants at the site investigated. It was considered that the endophytic fungi infect young leaves and remain latent in the leaves without producing symptoms while the hosts are physiologically active. Discostroma tricellulare was considered to be specific for R. obtusum. The colonization frequencies of the endophytic fungi were clearly lower on the leaves of P. japonica than on those of the other plants. it is considered that asebotoxin, which is known to be toxic to animals and insects, and other secondary metabolites retard fungal invasion in P. japonica.","J","Okane, I; Nakagiri, A; Ito, T",NA,"","","Okane, I; Nakagiri, A; Ito, T",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi in leaves of ericaceous plants","CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0008-4026","","",NA,NA,"APR",1998,76,"4",NA,"","",NA,"657","663","","10.1139/b98-032","http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b98-032","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000075420600012","View Full Record in Web of Science",71,"Presence"
"Root-knot nematodes limit horticultural crop production in Mexico where management is mainly based on nematicides that represent a risk to health and the environment. Thus, biological alternatives, such as the use of endophytic fungi, are currently being developed. The objective of this research was to isolate, identify and evaluate the antagonistic potential of endophytic fungi against the root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne enterolobii, M. incognita and the false root-knot nematode Nacobbus aberrans sensu lato (s.l.) occurring in Mexico. Endophytic fungi from chili pepper and tomato plants with a low root galling index were isolated from three localities in Sinaloa state (Villa Ju ' arez, Valle de Culiacan and La Cruz de Elota) and one in Mexico City (Xochimilco). Fourteen isolates from leaves and roots were evaluated to assess: i) the ability to promote growth in chili pepper and tomato plants, ii) the degree of parasitism on nematode eggs and second-stage juveniles (J2), and iii) the nematostatic and nematicidal effect of their filtrates on the J2. In the trials, the three most effective endophytic fungal isolates were Chaetomium globosum (S1TH2), Echria macrotheca (S3RT2) and Stagonospora trichophoricola (XRC3). All three fungal isolates increased growth on chili pepper plants after application, but only two (S3RT2 and XRC3) did so on tomato plants. S1TH2 parasitized M. enterolobii eggs; S3RT2 and XRC3 eggs of N. aberrans s. l.; S3RT2 also parasitized M. incognita eggs and J2 of N. aberrans s.l. The S1TH2 filtrate was nematostatic for M. incognita and N. aberrans s.l., the XRC3 filtrate was nematostatic for N. aberrans s.l., and the S3RT2 filtrate was nematostatic and nematicidal for the J2 of N. aberrans s.l. The results obtained indicate that these isolates could be involved in natural regulation and biological control of root-knot nematodes.","J","Silva-Valenzuela, M; Rojas-Martinez, RI; Manzanilla-Lopez, RH; Macias-Rubalcava, ML; Aranda-Ocampo, S; Zavaleta-Mejia, E",NA,"","","Silva-Valenzuela, Manuel; Rojas-Martinez, Reyna I.; Manzanilla-Lopez, Rosa H.; Macias-Rubalcava, Martha L.; Aranda-Ocampo, Sergio; Zavaleta-Mejia, Emma",NA,NA,"Antagonistic potential of endophytic fungi against Meloidogyne enterolobii, M. incognita and Nacobbus aberrans sensu lato","BIOLOGICAL CONTROL","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1049-9644","1090-2112","",NA,NA,"NOV",2023,186,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","105343","10.1016/j.biocontrol.2023.105343","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2023.105343","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001080473900001","View Full Record in Web of Science",72,"Presence"

"The microecology of endophytic fungi in special habitats, such as the interior of different tissues from a medicinal plant, and its effects on the formation of metabolites with different biological activities are of great importance. However, the factors affecting fungal community formation are unclear. This study is the first to utilize mini-community remodeling to understand the above phenomena. First, high-throughput sequencing technology was applied to explore the community composition and diversity of endophytic fungi in the above-ground tissues (Ea) and below-ground tissues (Eb) of Ephedra sinica. Second, fungi were obtained through culture-dependent technology and used for mini-community remodeling in vitro. Then, the effects of environmental factors, partner fungi, and plant tissue fluid (internal environment) on endophytic fungal community formation were discussed. Results showed that environmental factors played a decisive role in the selection of endophytic fungi, that is, in Ea and Eb, 93.8% and 25.3% of endophytic fungi were halophilic, respectively, and 10.6% and 60.2% fungi were sensitive to high temperature (33 & DEG;C), respectively. Meanwhile, pH had little effect on fungal commu-nities. The internal environment of the plant host further promoted the formation of endophytic fungal communities.& COPY; 2023 British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"Fungal endophytes inhabit living tissues of plants without any apparent symptoms and in many cases are known to produce secondary metabolites similar to those produced by their respective host plants. However on sub-culture, the endophytic fungi gradually attenuate their ability to produce the metabolites. Attenuation has been a major constraint in realizing the potential of endophytic fungi as an alternative source of plant secondary metabolites. In this study, we report attempts to restore camptothecine (CPT) production in attenuated endophytic fungi isolated from CPT producing plants, Nothapodytes nimmoniana and Miquelia dentata when they are passed through their host plant or plants that produce CPT and when treated with a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor. Attenuated endophytic fungi that traversed through their host tissue or plants capable of synthesizing CPT, produced significantly higher CPT compared to the attenuated fungi. Attenuated fungus cultured in the presence of 5-azacytidine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, had an enhanced CPT content compared to untreated attenuated fungus. These results indicate that the attenuation of CPT production in endophytic fungi could in principle be reversed by eliciting some signals from plant tissue, most likely that which prevents the methylation or silencing of the genes responsible for CPT biosynthesis.","J","Vasanthakumari, MM; Jadhav, SS; Sachin, N; Vinod, G; Shweta, S; Manjunatha, BL; Kumara, PM; Ravikanth, G; Nataraja, KN; Shaanker, RU",NA,"","","Vasanthakumari, M.

"Using endophytic fungal elicitors to increase the accumulation of valuable secondary metabolites in plant tissue culture is an effective biotechnology strategy. In this study, a collection of 56 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated from different organs of cultivated Panax ginseng, of which seven strains can be symbiotically co-cultured with the hairy roots of P. ginseng. Further experiments observed that strain 3R-2, identified as endophytic fungus Schizophyllum commune, can not only infect hairy roots but also promote the accumulation of specific ginsenosides. This was further verified because S. commune colonization significantly affected the overall metabolic profile of ginseng hairy roots. By comparing the effects of S. commune mycelia and its mycelia extract (EM) on ginsenoside production in P. ginseng hairy roots, the EM was confirmed to be a relatively better stimulus elicitor. Additionally, the introduction of EM elicitor can significantly enhance the expressions of key enzyme genes of pgHMGR, pgSS, pgSE, and pgSD involved in the biosynthetic pathway of ginsenosides, which was deemed the most relevant factor for promoting ginsenosides production during the elicitation period. In conclusion, this study is the first to show that the EM of endophytic fungus S. commune can be considered as an effective endophytic fungal elicitor for increasing the biosynthesis of ginsenosides in hairy root cultures of P. ginseng.","J","Xie, XG; Zhang, ZZ; Chen, L; Ming, QL; Sheng, KX; Chen, X; Rahman, K; Feng, KM; Su, J; Han, T",NA,"","","Xie, Xing-Guang; Zhang, Zhen-Zhen; Chen, Ling; Ming, Qian-Liang; Sheng, Ke-Xin; Chen, Xi; Rahman, Khalid; Feng, Kun-Miao; Su, Juan; Han, Ting",NA,NA,"An endophytic fungus Schizophyllum commune isolated from Panax ginseng enhances hairy roots growth and ginsenoside biosynthesis","CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0008-4166","1480-3275","",NA,NA,"2023 APR 14",2023,NA,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","","10.1139/cjm-2022-0194","http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjm-2022-0194","","APR 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37084415,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000995828300001","View Full Record in Web of Science",77,"Presence"
"As a traditional Chinese medicine, Salvia miltiorrhiza rhizome is mainly used to treat cardiovascular diseases. Symbiosis of endophytic fungi with their host plants, is an effectively regulatory means to promote the growth and secondary metabolism of medicinal plants. Here, an endophytic fungus Mucor circinelloides DF20 was cocultivated with the sterile seedlings of S. miltiorrhiza, to clarify the promoting mechanism on tanshinone biosynthesis and accumulation in S. miltiorrhiza root. The assay of promoting-growth activities in vitro showed that DF20 have the ability to produce IAA and siderophores. DF20 could significantly promote the biosynthesis and accumulation of tanshinones in the root of S. miltiorrhiza, especially the content of tanshinone IIA, reaching 4.630 ? 0.342 mg/g after 56 days of DF20 treatment, which is 22-fold of the control group. The result also showed that the hyphae of M. circunelloides DF20 mainly colonized in the root tissue interspace of S. miltiorrhiza, and a small amount of hyphae were located inside the cells. The results of florescent real-time quantitative RTPCR showed that DF20 colonization significantly increase the expression level of some key enzyme genes (DXS, DXR, HMGR, GGPPS) in tanshinone biosynthesis pathway, but the regulatory effect mainly occurred in the early stage of co-culture, while the expression level decreased in different degrees in the later stage. In conclusion, the endophytic fungus M. circunelloides DF20 can form an interaction relationship with its host, then to promote the biosynthesis and accumulation of tanshinones in root by upregulating the key enzyme genes expression levels of the biosynthesis pathway.","J","Chen, HM; Qi, Y; He, XY; Xu, LN; Zhang, WY; Lv, XM; Zhang, HH; Yang, DF; Zhu, YH; Liang, ZS",NA,"","","Chen, Haimin; Qi, Yao; He, Xiaoyi; Xu, Linna; Zhang, Wenyi; Lv, Xiaoman; Zhang, Haihua; Yang, Dongfeng; Zhu, Yonghong; Liang, Zongsuo",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungus Mucor circinelloides DF20 promote tanshinone biosynthesis and accumulation in Salvia miltiorrhiza root","PLANT SCIENCE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"liu, li/HGC-0900-2022","Chen, Haimin/0000-0002-5794-5254; Zhang, Wenyi/0000-0002-1107-0587; Lv, Xiaoman/0000-0003-3260-2594",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0168-9452","1873-2259","",NA,NA,"JUN",2021,307,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","110898","10.1016/j.plantsci.2021.110898","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plantsci.2021.110898","","APR 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33902857,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000644420600005","View Full Record in Web of Science",78,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi are present within all plants and more than one million species are predicted to be present. They are widely studied as they promote plant growth as well as resistance to environmental stress, produce bioactive compounds that have industrial applications and play a vital role in biogeochemical cycles. The medicinal plant Cassia (commonly known as seenas) belongs to the Order Fabales Family Caesalpiniaceae. This plant is a native of tropics which is useful as an ornamental plant, cassia gum, cuisines, etc. It is also a source for the laxative drug known as Sennosides complex, which has been used by Egyptians since ancient times. This drug is mainly obtained from Cassia augustifolia and Cassia fistula. The active constituents of this drug are dianthrone glycosides (Sennosides A, B, C, D, etc.), free anthraquinones (aloe-emodin, chrysophanol, rhein) and anthraquinones glycosides. However, due to urbanization the plant source has become scarce, so an attempt has been made to isolate endophytic fungi from this medicinal plant and screen for biosynthesis of Sennosides complex. Plants were collected from six (6) locations/sites at Ahmedabad, Anand (Boriavi), Bavla, Bhuj (Madhapur and Saiyadpur), Dantiwada in Gujarat; and Jodhpur in Rajasthan. 22 isolates were identified based on colony, microscopic/morphological characteristics; and identity of thirteen isolates was also done by phylogenetic analysis. The endophytes belonged to the genera Alterneria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Curvularia, Fusarium, Penicillium, Phellinus, etc. The isolates were obtained to screen for production of Sennosides (extracellular).

"Psychrophilic microorganisms are cold-adapted organisms that have an optimum growth temperature below 15 A degrees C, and often below 5 A degrees C. Endophytic microorganisms live inside healthy plants and biosynthesize an array of secondary metabolites which confer major ecological benefits to their host. We provide information, for the first time, on an endophytic association between bioactive psychrophilic fungi and trees in Cupressaceae plant family living in temperate to cold, semi-arid habitats. We have recovered psychrophilic endophytic fungi (PEF) from healthy foliar tissues of Cupressus arizonica, Cupressus sempervirens and Thuja orientalis (Cupressaceae, Coniferales). In total, 23 such fungi were found out of 110 endophytic fungal isolates. They were identified as ascomycetous fungi, more specifically Phoma herbarum, Phoma sp. and Dothideomycetes spp., all from Dothideomycetes. The optimal growth temperature for all these 23 fungal isolates was 4 A degrees C, and the PEF isolates were able to biosynthesize secondary metabolite at this temperature. Extracted metabolites from PEF showed significant antiproliferative/cytotoxic, antifungal and antibacterial effects against phytopathogenic fungi and bacteria. Of special interest was their antibacterial activity against the ice-nucleation active bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. Accordingly, we suggest that evergreen Cupressaceae plants may benefit from their psychrophilic endophytic fungi during cold stress. Whether such endosymbionts confer any ecological and evolutionary benefits to their host plants remains to be investigated in vivo.","J","Moghaddam, MSH; Soltani, J",NA,"","","Moghaddam, Mahdieh S.

"One hundred and twenty-one isolates of endophytic fungi were recovered from leaves of the bioactive Brazilian plant species Ageratum myriadenia, Palicourea tetraphylla, Piptadenia adiantoides, and Trixis vauthieri. All fungal isolates were cultivated in liquid media and crude extracts were obtained with ethyl acetate. The crude extracts were tested in bioassay panels using Leishmania amazonensis, Trypanosoma cruzi, the enzyme trypanothione reductase (TryR) from Trypanosoma cruzi, and three human cancer cell lines. Thirty-three extracts (27.2%) exhibited at least one biological activity. Seventeen extracts (14%) were cytotoxic against one or more human cancer cell line with the IC50 values ranged of >0.2 to 25 mu g/mL. Twenty-four extracts (19.8%) inhibited the activity of TryR, and three showed ability to inhibit the growth of T. cruzi above 60% and their IC50 values ranged among 1 to 10 mu g/mL. Eleven extracts (9%) were able to inhibit the growth of L. amazonensis and showed with IC50 values ranged among 4.6 to 24.4 mu g/mL. The endophytic fungi were identified as belonging to the genera Alternaria, Arthrinium, Cochliobolus, Colletotrichum, Penicillium, Fusarium, and Gibberella. An interesting result was obtained for the bioactive isolates UFMGCB 508, 537, 899 and 903, which were related to fungi associated with medicinal plants native to Asia, Australia, Africa, and Polynesia.

"As the population ages globally, there seem to be more people with Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, there is currently no specific treatment for the disease. At present, Huperzine A (HupA) is one of the best drugs used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and has been used in clinical trials for several years in China. HupA was first separated from Huperzia serrata, a traditional medicinal herb that is used to cure fever, contusions, strains, hematuria, schizophrenia, and snakebite for several hundreds of years in China, and has been confirmed to have acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity. With the very slow growth of H. serrata, resources are becoming too scarce to meet the need for clinical treatment. Some endophytic fungal strains that produce HupA were isolated from H. serrate in previous studies. In this article, the diversity of the endophytic fungal community within H. serrata was observed and the relevance to the production of HupA by the host plant was further analyzed. A total of 1167 strains were obtained from the leaves of H. serrata followed by the stems (1045) and roots (824). The richness as well as diversity of endophytic fungi within the leaf and stem were higher than in the root. The endophytic fungal community was similar within stems as well as in leaves at all taxonomic levels. The 11 genera (Derxomyces, Lophiostoma, Cyphellophora, Devriesia, Serendipita, Kurtzmanomyces, Mycosphaerella, Conoideocrella, Brevicellicium, Piskurozyma, and Trichomerium) were positively correlated with HupA content. The correlation index of Derxomyces with HupA contents displayed the highest value (CI = 0.92), whereas Trichomerium showed the lowest value (CI = 0.02). Through electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), it was confirmed that the HS7-1 strain could produce HupA and the total alkaloid concentration was 3.7 ug/g. This study will enable us to screen and isolate the strain that can produce HupA and to figure out the correlation between endophytic fungal diversity with HupA content in different plant organs. This can provide new insights into the screening of strains that can produce HupA more effectively.","J","Cui, LL; Noushahi, HA; Zhang, YP; Liu, JX; Cosoveanu, A; Liu, Y; Yan, L; Zhang, J; Shu, SH",NA,"","","Cui, Lingli; Noushahi, Hamza Armghan; Zhang, Yipeng; Liu, Jinxin; Cosoveanu, Andreea; Liu, Ying; Yan, Ling; Zhang, Jing; Shu, Shaohua",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungal Community of Huperzia serrata: Diversity and Relevance to the Production of Huperzine A by the Plant Host","MOLECULES","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zhang, Yanfei/IXW-5406-2023; NOUSHAHI, HAMZA ARMGHAN/GWR-3425-2022; Cosoveanu, Andreea/J-3093-2019","NOUSHAHI, HAMZA ARMGHAN/0000-0002-3179-5585; Cosoveanu, Andreea/0000-0002-6233-7296",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1420-3049","",NA,NA,"FEB",2021,26,"4",NA,"","",NA,"","","892","10.3390/molecules26040892","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules26040892","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33567664,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000624173600001","View Full Record in Web of Science",82,"Presence"
"The diversity and metal tolerance of endophytic fungi from six dominant plant species in a Pb-Zn mine wasteland in Yunnan, China were investigated. Four hundred and ninety-five endophytic fungi were isolated from 690 tissue segments. The endophytic fungal colonization extent and isolation extent ranged from 59 % to 75 %, and 0.42-0.93, respectively, and a positive correlation was detected between them. Stems harboured more endophytic fungi than leaves in each plant species, and the average colonization extent of stems was 82 %, being significantly higher than that of leaves (47 %) (P <= 0.001, chi-square test). The fungi were identified to 20 taxa in which Phoma, Alternaria and Peyronellaea were the dominant genera and the relative frequencies of them were 39.6 %, 19.0% and 20.4 %, respectively. Metal tolerance test showed that 3.6 mM Pb2+ or 11.5 mM Zn2+ exhibited the greatest toxicity to some isolates and they did not grow on the metal-amended media. In contrast, some isolates were growth stimulated in the presence of tested metals. The isolates of Phoma were more sensitive to Zn2+ than the isolates of Alternaria and Peyronellaea. However, the sensitivity of isolates to Pb2+ was not significantly different among Phoma, Alternaria, Peyronellaea and other taxa (P > 0.05, chi-square test). Our results suggested that fungal endophyte colonization in Pb-Zn polluted plants is moderately abundant and some isolates have a marked adaptation to Pb2+ and Zn2+ metals, which has a potential application in phytoremediation in this area.

"Endophytic fungi have the ability to co-exist with their host plants without causing any harm and are beneficial to both the plant and the fungi. The current study determined the antimicrobial properties and identify the chemical compounds of secondary metabolites produced by endophytic fungi isolated from Sceletium tortuosum L. A total of 60 endophytic fungi produced secondary metabolites that were detected after fermentation and extraction. Antibacterial properties of the secondary metabolites were determined using the disc diffusion assay against pathogenic environmental Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as control stains. The chemical compounds were characterized by GC-MS. Overall, 15% of fungal extracts displayed narrow spectrum of activity against the bacteria strains. Despite this, none of the fungal extracts inhibited growth of Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC S1299) and Enterococcus gallinarum (ATCC 700425) while Bacillus cereus (ATCC 10876) was the most susceptible against the fungal extracts. Fusarium oxysporum (GG 008) with accession no.

"Glioblastoma is the most devastating primary brain tumor. Current treatment is palliative, making necessary the development of new therapeutic strategies to offer alternatives to patients. Therefore, endophytes represent an interesting source of natural metabolites with anticancer potential. These microorganisms reside in tissues of living plants and act to improve their growth. Evidence revealed that several medicinal plants are colonized by endophytic fungi producer of antitumor metabolites. Achyrocline satureioides is a Brazilian medicinal plant characterized by its properties against gastrointestinal disturbances, anticancer and antioxidant effects. However, there are no reports describing the endophytic composition of A. satureioides. The present study proposes the isolation of endophytic fungus from A. satureioides, extract preparation, phytochemical characterization and evaluation of its antiglioma potential. Our data showed that crude extracts of endophyte decreased glioma viability with IC50 values of 1.60-1.63 mu g/mL to eDCM (dichloromethane extract) and 37.30-55.12 mu g/mL to eEtAc (ethyl acetate extract), respectively. Crude extracts induced cell death by apoptosis with modulation of redox status. In order to bioprospect anticancer metabolites, endophytic fungus extracts were subjected to guided fractionation and purification yielded five fractions of each extract. Six of ten fractions showed selective antiproliferative activity against glioma cells, with IC50 values ranged from 0.95 to 131.3 mu g/mL. F3(DCM) (from eDCM) and F3(EtA)(c) (from eEtAc) fractions promoted C6 glioma toxicity with IC50 of 1.0 and 27.05 mu g/mL, respectively. F3(EtA)(c) fraction induced late apoptosis and arrest in G2/M stage, while F3(DCM) promoted apoptosis with arrest in Sub-G1 phase. Moreover, F3(DCM) increased antioxidant defense and decreased ROS production. Additionally, F3(DCM) showed no cytotoxic activity against astrocytes, revealing selective effect. Based on promising potential of F3(DCM), we identified the production of Sch-642305, a lactone, which showed antiproliferative properties with IC50 values of 1.1 and 7.6 mu g/mL to C6 and U138MG gliomas, respectively. Sch-642305 promoted arrest on cell cycle in G2/M inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, this lactone decreased glioma cell migration and modulated redox status, increasing superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and enhancing sulfhydryl content, consequently suppressing reactive species of oxygen generation. Taken together, these results indicate that metabolites produced by endophytic fungus isolated from A. satureioides have therapeutic potential as antiglioma agent.","J","Pedra, NS; Galdino, KDC; da Silva, DS; Ramos, PT; Bona, NP; Soares, MSP; Azambuja, JH; Canuto, KM; de Brito, ES; Ribeiro, PRV; Souza, ASDQ; Cunico, W; Stefanello, FM; Spanevello, RM; Braganhol, E",NA,"","","Pedra, Nathalia Stark; Araujo Galdino, Kennia de Cassia; da Silva, Daniel Schuch; Ramos, Priscila Treptow; Bona, Natalia Pontes; Pereira Soares, Mayara Sandrielly; Azambuja, Juliana Hoffstater; Canuto, Kirley Marques; de Brito, Edy Sousa; Vasconcelos Ribeiro, Paulo Riceli; de Queiroz Souza, Ana Sheila; Cunico, Wilson; Stefanello, Francieli Moro; Spanevello, Roselia Maria; Braganhol, Elizandra",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungus Isolated From Achyrocline satureioides Exhibits Selective Antiglioma Activity-The Role of Sch-642305","FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"de Brito, Edy Sousa/I-3587-2012; Braganhol, Elizandra/C-6439-2013; Canuto, Kirley Marques/P-7090-2019; Cunico, wilson joao/M-7516-2015; Spanevello, Roselia M/H-1610-2018; Vasconcelos Ribeiro, Paulo Riceli/P-4672-2019","de Brito, Edy Sousa/0000-0003-4084-8076; Canuto, Kirley Marques/0000-0003-3194-6125; Cunico, wilson joao/0000-0003-2577-5323; Vasconcelos Ribeiro, Paulo Riceli/0000-0002-5258-4015; Spanevello, Roselia/0000-0002-5117-2000",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2234-943X","","",NA,NA,"OCT 29",2018,8,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","476","10.3389/fonc.2018.00476","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2018.00476","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30420941,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000448504900001","View Full Record in Web of Science",85,"Presence"
"Stipa purpurea is a unique and dominant herbaceous plant species in the alpine steppe and meadows on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). In this work, we analyzed the composition and diversity of the culturable endophytic fungi in S. purpurea according to morphological and molecular identification. Then, we investigated the bioactivities of these fungi against plant pathogenic fungi and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACCD) deaminase activities. A total of 323 fungal isolates were first isolated from S. purpurea, and 33 fungal taxa were identified by internal transcribed spacer primers and grouped into Ascomycota. The diversity of endophytic fungi in S. purpurea was significantly higher in roots as compared to leaves. In addition, more than 40% of the endophytic fungi carried the gene encoding for the ACCD gene.

"Background. Endophytic fungi influence the quality and quantity of the medicinal plant's bioactive compounds through specific fungus-host interactions. Nevertheless, due to the paucity of information, the composition of endophytic fungal communities and the mechanism by which effective ingredients regulate endophytic fungal communities in roots remains unclear. Methods. In this study, we collected root and soil samples (depth range: 0-20, 20-40, and 40-60 cm) of three Glycyrrhiza species (Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Glycyrrhiza inflata, and Glycyrrhiza glabra). Glycyrrhizic acid and liquiritin content were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and total flavonoid content was determined using ultraviolet spectrophotometry. High-throughput sequencing technology was employed to explore the composition and diversity of the endophytic fungal community in different root segments of three Glycyrrhiza species. Furthermore, soil samples were subjected to physicochemical analyses. Results. We observed that the liquiritin content was not affected by the root depth (0-20 cm, 20-40 cm, and 40-60 cm). Still, it was significantly affected by the Glycyrrhiza species (Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Glycyrrhiza inflata, Glycyrrhiza glabra) (P < 0:05). In Glycyrrhiza root, a total of eight phyla and 140 genera were annotated so far, out of which Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla, and the Fusarium, Paraphoma, and Helminthosporium genera were found to be significantly dominant. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that liquiritin content was accountable for the differences in the diversity of the endophytic fungal community. Furthermore, distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA) showed that physicochemical properties of the soil (available potassium and ammonium nitrogen) and the root factors (liquiritin and water content) were the main contributing factors for the variations in the overall structure of the endophytic fungal community. Our results showed that the effective ingredients of Glycyrrhiza root and physicochemical properties of the soil regulated the endophytic fungal community composition and medicinal licorice diversity.","J","Dang, HL; Zhang, T; Wang, ZK; Li, GF; Zhao, WQ; Lv, XH; Zhuang, L",NA,"","","Dang, Hanli; Zhang, Tao; Wang, Zhongke; Li, Guifang; Zhao, Wenqin; Lv, Xinhua; Zhuang, Li",NA,NA,"Differences in the endophytic fungal community and effective ingredients in root of three Glycyrrhiza species in Xinjiang, China","PEERJ","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2167-8359","","",NA,NA,"MAR 9",2021,9,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","e11047","10.7717/peerj.11047","http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11047","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33854843,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000626721800016","View Full Record in Web of Science",88,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi live symbiotically in the tissues of plants. Although a large amount of evidence suggests a mutualistic role for vertically transmitted endophytic fungi in agronomic grasses, the role of horizontally transmitted endophytic fungi as mutualists has been challenged. Recent studies, however, have shown that horizontally transmitted endophytic fungi can act as mutualists to their plant hosts by providing defense against pathogens and defoliators. In particular, several experimental studies have shown that endophytic fungi interact negatively with leaf-cutting ants and their fungal cultivar, but these studies were performed under laboratory conditions. Using field colonies of Atta colombica in Central Panama, we measured the fungal endophyte content in the forage material of leaf-cutting ants and compared it to ambient endophyte levels. We then used the collected data to model the area of plant material containing endophytes that enters a mature colony daily. We found that mature colonies collect leaf material that is 20% lower in endophyte abundance than surrounding leaves. A similar pattern was observed for newly emerged colonies. Our model suggests that via ant foraging preferences, leaf-cutting ants reduce the possible area of material containing endophytes entering the colony by 33%. Our results provide further evidence for a negative interaction between leaf-cutting ants and horizontally transmitted endophytes, suggesting that fungal endophytes have a defensive role in tropical plants by influencing leaf-cutting ant foraging preferences.","J","Coblentz, KE; Van Bael, SA",NA,"","","Coblentz, Kyle E.; Van Bael, Sunshine A.",NA,NA,"Field colonies of leaf-cutting ants select plant materials containing low abundances of endophytic fungi","ECOSPHERE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Coblentz, Kyle/AAU-5549-2021; Van Bael, Sunshine/K-1930-2019; Van Bael, Sunshine/M-5370-2019","Coblentz, Kyle/0000-0002-0069-8491; Van Bael, Sunshine/0000-0001-7317-3533",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2150-8925","","",NA,NA,"MAY",2013,4,"5",NA,"","",NA,"","","66","10.1890/ES13-00012.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/ES13-00012.1","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000327308300015","View Full Record in Web of Science",89,"Both"

Five representative species gave positive amplification hits by molecular marker screening with the bapt gene. These fungi were characterized and identified based on morphological and molecular identification. The taxol-producing capability of these endophytic fungi was validated by HPLC-MS.

"In the present study, four endophytic fungi (GM-1, GM-2, GM-3, and GM-4) were tested for their ability to improve soybean plant growth under salinity stress conditions. The seed germination and plant growth were higher in seeds pretreated with endophytic fungal cultures than their controls. The positive influence of fungi on plant growth was supported by gibberellins analysis of culture filtrate (CF), which showed wide diversity and various concentrations of GAs. Specifically, GA(4), GA(7), GA(8), GA(9), GA(12), and GA(20) were found in fungal CFs. Under salinity stress conditions, GM-1 significantly enhanced the length and fresh weight of soybean plants relative to other fungal treatments. GM-1 effectively mitigated the adverse effects of salinity by limiting lipid peroxidation and accumulating protein content. GM-2, GM-3, and GM-4 also counteracted the salinity induced oxidative stress in soybean plants through reduction of lipid peroxidation and enhancement of protein content, maintaining the length and fresh weight of shoots. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase were inhibited in salinity exposed plants, while GM-1 significantly enhanced these antioxidant enzyme activities in plants under salt stress. GM-1 treatment also showed lower levels of abscisic acid and elevated levels of salicylic acid in plants under salinity stress. Hence, GM-1 was identified as Fusarium verticillioides (teleomorph Gibberella moniliformis) isolate RK01 based on its DNA sequence homology. These results suggest that endophytic fungal (F. verticillioides) pre-treatment of soybean seeds would be an effective method to promote soybean plant growth under salinity stress conditions.","J","Radhakrishnan, R; Khan, AL; Lee, IJ",NA,"","","Radhakrishnan, Ramalingam; Khan, Abdul Latif; Lee, In-Jung",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungal pre-treatments of seeds alleviates salinity stress effects in soybean plants","JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Lee, In-Jung/GLS-0432-2022; Radhakrishnan, Ramalingam/A-2295-2019","Lee, In-Jung/0000-0001-7154-4820; Radhakrishnan, Ramalingam/0000-0003-4972-7967; Khan, Abdul Latif/0000-0001-9700-8903",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1225-8873","1976-3794","",NA,NA,"DEC",2013,51,"6",NA,"","",NA,"850","857","","10.1007/s12275-013-3168-8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12275-013-3168-8","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24385364,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000329238900020","View Full Record in Web of Science",91,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi are highly potential for the production of pharmaceutically valuable compounds such as anticancer, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antidiabetic and industrial enzymes, etc. Today human faces a lot of challenges for existence due to the appearance of new diseases, infections, drug resistances and imbalances in the ecosystems. Here endophytes were the potential sources for the new remedies. Endophytes are contemplated as a treasury for bioprospecting, and they assist in many forms to conquer many complications. Among the various endophytic microbes, fungi have been found most potential microorganisms which are a reservoir of largely untapped bioactive metabolites.

"Background: Paclitaxel (Taxol (TM)) is an important anticancer drug with a unique mode of action. The biosynthesis of paclitaxel had been considered restricted to the Taxus species until it was discovered in Taxomyces andreanae, an endophytic fungus of T. brevifolia. Subsequently, paclitaxel was found in hazel (Corylus avellana L.) and in several other endophytic fungi. The distribution of paclitaxel in plants and endophytic fungi and the reported sequence homology of key genes in paclitaxel biosynthesis between plant and fungi species raises the question about whether the origin of this pathway in these two physically associated groups could have been facilitated by horizontal gene transfer. Results: The ability of the endophytic fungus of hazel Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 to independently synthesize paclitaxel was established by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance. The genome of Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 was sequenced and gene candidates that may be involved in paclitaxel biosynthesis were identified by comparison with the 13 known paclitaxel biosynthetic genes in Taxus. We found that paclitaxel biosynthetic gene candidates in P. aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 have evolved independently and that horizontal gene transfer between this endophytic fungus and its plant host is unlikely. Conclusions: Our findings shed new light on how paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungi synthesize paclitaxel, and will facilitate metabolic engineering for the industrial production of paclitaxel from fungi.","J","Yang, YF; Zhao, HN; Barrero, RA; Zhang, BH; Sun, GL; Wilson, IW; Xie, FL; Walker, KD; Parks, JW; Bruce, R; Guo, GW; Chen, L; Zhang, Y; Huang, X; Tang, Q; Liu, HW; Bellgard, MI; Qiu, DY; Lai, JS; Hoffman, A",NA,"","","Yang, Yanfang; Zhao, Hainan; Barrero, Roberto A.; Zhang, Baohong; Sun, Guiling; Wilson, Iain W.; Xie, Fuliang; Walker, Kevin D.; Parks, Joshua W.; Bruce, Robert; Guo, Guangwu; Chen, Li; Zhang, Yong; Huang, Xin; Tang, Qi; Liu, Hongwei; Bellgard, Matthew I.; Qiu, Deyou; Lai, Jinsheng; Hoffman, Angela",NA,NA,"Genome sequencing and analysis of the paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungus Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431","BMC GENOMICS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wilson, Iain/D-4839-2009; Zhang, Yong/AAS-3454-2020; Zhang, Baohong/O-4948-2016","Wilson, Iain/0000-0002-4626-8059; Bellgard, Matthew/0000-0002-6303-9469; Zhang, Yong/0000-0002-2276-7187; Walker, Kevin/0000-0001-5208-6692; Barrero, Roberto/0000-0002-7735-665X; Tang, Qi/0000-0003-2385-4263",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1471-2164","","",NA,NA,"JAN 25",2014,15,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","69","10.1186/1471-2164-15-69","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-15-69","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24460898,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000332573300001","View Full Record in Web of Science",93,"Presence"
"The purpose of this study was to examine antimicrobial activity of endophytic fungi isolated from the leaves, stems, and roots of 54 species of Orchidaceae collected in a Brazilian tropical ecosystem. In total, 382 filamentous fungi and 13 yeast isolates were obtained and cultured to examine the production of crude extracts. Thirty-three percent of the isolates displayed antimicrobial activity against at least one target microorganism. The multivariate statistical analyses conducted indicate that the extracts of endophytic fungi isolated from leaves of terrestrial orchids in semideciduous forest were more active against Escherichia coli, whereas extracts of endophytic fungi from roots of rupicolous orchids collected in rock fields were more active against Candida krusei and Candida albicans. Among the fungi that were screened in the study, 22 isolates held their antimicrobial activities after replication and were therefore selected for assessment of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), which ranged from 62.5 to 250 mu g/mL and 7.8 to 250 mu g/mL against bacteria and fungi, respectively. One isolate of Alternaria sp. and one isolate of Fusarium oxysporum presented the strongest antibacterial activity. Three Fusarium isolates, Epicoccum nigrum, and Sclerostagonospora opuntiae showed the greatest MIC values against the pathogenic yeasts. This study is the first survey investigating the bioactive potential of endophytic fungi associated with tropical Orchidaceae species present in Brazilian ecosystems.","J","Vaz, ABM; Mota, RC; Bomfim, MRQ; Vieira, MLA; Zani, CL; Rosa, CA; Rosa, LH",NA,"","","Vaz, Aline B.

"To examine how host plant genotype, endophytic fungal species, and their interaction may affect growth and key chemical content and composition in an important orchid species, we assessed four Dendrobium catenatum cultivars co-cultured with three fungi previously isolated from D. catenatum. Fungal endophytes (Tulasnella sp., Leptosphaeria microscopica, and Guignardia sp.) specifically affected the growth and chemical composition of the four cultivars. Fungal infection significantly increased certain growth traits, especially mid-stem thickness, stem biomass, stem polysaccharide and ethanol-soluble extractive content, and leaf flavonoid and phenol content. Presence or abundance of some key chemical components was also altered by fungal treatment. These increases and alterations were highly dependent on the host genotype. The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of Dendrobium and endophytic fungi interactions, and provide vital information for improving the development and use of endophytic fungi in D. catenatum breeding.

"Plant-associated endophytes define an important symbiotic association in nature and are established bio-reservoirs of plant-derived natural products. Endophytes colonize the internal tissues of a plant without causing any disease symptoms or apparent changes. Recently, there has been a growing interest in endophytes because of their beneficial effects on the production of novel metabolites of pharmacological significance. Studies have highlighted the socio-economic implications of endophytic fungi in agriculture, medicine, and the environment, with considerable success. Endophytic fungi-mediated biosynthesis of well-known metabolites includes taxol from Taxomyces andreanae, azadirachtin A and B from Eupenicillium parvum, vincristine from Fusarium oxysporum, and quinine from Phomopsis sp. The discovery of the billion-dollar anticancer drug taxol was a landmark in endophyte biology/research and established new paradigms for the metabolic potential of plant-associated endophytes. In addition, endophytic fungi have emerged as potential prolific producers of antimicrobials, antiseptics, and antibiotics of plant origin. Although extensively studied as a production platform of novel pharmacological metabolites, the molecular mechanisms of plant-endophyte dynamics remain less understood/explored for their efficient utilization in drug discovery. The emerging trends in endophytic fungi-mediated biosynthesis of novel bioactive metabolites, success stories of key pharmacological metabolites, strategies to overcome the existing challenges in endophyte biology, and future direction in endophytic fungi-based drug discovery forms the underlying theme of this article.","J","Tiwari, P; Bae, H",NA,"","","Tiwari, Pragya; Bae, Hanhong",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungi: Key Insights, Emerging Prospects, and Challenges in Natural Product Drug Discovery","MICROORGANISMS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2076-2607","",NA,NA,"FEB",2022,10,"2",NA,"","",NA,"","","360","10.3390/microorganisms10020360","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10020360","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35208814,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000778712500001","View Full Record in Web of Science",98,"Review"
"The assembly of horizontally transmitted endophytic fungi within plant tissues may be affected by biotic filtering. In other words, only particular endophytic fungal taxa from the available inoculum pool may be able to colonize a given plant species. We tested that hypothesis in Bromus tectorum, an important invasive species in the arid, western United States. We collected seed from Bromus tectorum and sources of inoculum for endophytic fungi including soil and various kinds of plant litter at a field site in central Utah. We characterized, using Illumina sequencing, the endophytic fungal communities in the various inoculum sources, inoculated Bromus tectorum seedlings under gnotobiotic conditions with the various sources, and then characterized the communities of endophytic fungi that assembled in their roots and leaves. Different inoculum sources containing significantly different endophytic fungal communities produced complex communities of endophytic fungi in leaves and roots of Bromus tectorum. In leaves, the communities assembling from the various inoculum sources were not significantly different from each other and, in roots, they were only slightly different from each other, mainly due to variation in a single fungal OTU, Coprinopsis brunneofibrillosa. Consequently, there was significantly more variation in the structure of the communities of endophytic fungi among the inoculum sources than in the resultant endophytic fungal communities in the leaves and roots of Bromus tectorum. These results are consistent with biotic filtering playing a significant role in endophytic fungal community assembly.","J","Ricks, KD; Koide, RT",NA,"","","Ricks, Kevin D.; Koide, Roger T.",NA,NA,"Biotic filtering of endophytic fungal communities in Bromus tectorum","OECOLOGIA","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Koide, Roger/I-4033-2012; Koide, Roger/AAE-7763-2020","Koide, Roger/0000-0002-5209-5422; Koide, Roger/0000-0002-5209-5422; Ricks, Kevin/0000-0001-8067-8900",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0029-8549","1432-1939","",NA,NA,"APR",2019,189,"4",NA,"","",NA,"993","1003","","10.1007/s00442-019-04388-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-019-04388-y","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30900053,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000466216700013","View Full Record in Web of Science",99,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi act as seed endosymbiont, thereby playing a very crucial role in the growth and development of seeds. Seed-vectored endophytic fungi establish an everlasting association with seeds and travel from generation to generation. To explore the composition and diversity of endophytic fungi in Alpinia zerumbet seeds, high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing was employed for the following stages: fruit formation period (YSJ1), young fruit period (YSJ2), early mature period (YSJ3), middle mature period (YSJ4), and late mature period (YSJ5). A total of 906,694 sequence reads and 745 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained and further classified into 8 phyla, 30 classes, 73 orders, 163 families, 302 genera, and 449 species. The highest endophytic fungal diversity was observed at YSJ5. The genera with the highest abundance were Cladosporium, Kodamaea, Hannaella, Mycothermus, Gibberella, Sarocladium, and Neopestalotiopsis. Functional Guild (FUNGuild) analysis revealed that endophytic fungi were undefined saprotroph, plant pathogens, animal pathogen-endophyte-lichen parasite-plant pathogen-wood saprotroph, and soil saprotrophs. Alternaria, Fusarium, Cladosporium, and Sarocladium, which are potential probiotics and can be used as biocontrol agents, were also abundant.

"Cinnamomum longepaniculatum is an important commercial crop and main source of volatile terpenoids. Terpenoid biosynthesis constitutes a multi-step, multi-enzyme process affected by various factors. In this study two endophytic fungi (Penicillium commune 2J1 and Neurospora crassa 3J1) were used to treat the samples and transcriptome sequencing was performed to explore the differences in regulation of gene expression related to volatile terpenoid metabolism. Treatment with 2J1 and 3J1 resulted in 8315 and 6516 differentially expressed unigenes, respectively, with a greater proportion of upregulated genes in latter group. Both endophytic fungi upregulated genes involved in the monoterpene-biosynthetic pathway in C. longepaniculatum. Annotation of unigenes involved in plant hormone signal transduction revealed differential expression relative to the control in several key signaling pathways. NPR1 (nonexpressor of PR-1) and PR-1 (pathogenesis-related protein 1) were significantly upregulated following 2J1 treatment in the SA (salicylic acid) signal-transduction pathway, with TGA (TGA transcription factor) significantly downregulated, whereas all of these genes were upregulated after 3J1 treatment. JA (Jasmonic acid) signaling pathway genes JAR1 (jasmonic acid resistant 1), JAZ (jasmonate ZIM-domaincontaining protein) and MYC2 (transcription factor MYC2) showed upregulated expression following 2J1 treatment, whereas JAZ expression was downregulated following 3J1 treatment. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction validated the transcriptome results for genes involved in the monoterpene-biosynthetic pathway of C. longepaniculatum. Collectively, these annotations of unigenes associated with secondary metabolism, plant hormone-signal transduction and terpenoid biosynthesis provide valuable insight into the endophytic fungi-regulated biosynthesis of essential oils in C. longepaniculatum. These findings establish a foundation for the subsequent cloning of volatile terpenoid-metabolism-related genes in C. longepaniculatum.

"This study reports the isolation of 63 endophytic fungal isolates from two traditional medicinal plants, Ocimum sanctum and Sapindus detergens from different locations of Amritsar, India. The functional characterization of the fungi for their ability to produce anti bacterial and anti cancer agent was carried out. Sixteen strains were characterized at molecular level by sequencing the amplified ITSI-5.8-ITSII region of rDNA. The phylogenetic tree resolved the endophytic fungi into different clades. The fungal endophytes belonging to order Pleosporales (Alternaria sp., Phoma sojicola and Exserohilum sp.) were functionally versatile as they produced diverse biomolecules including antibacterial agent active against Mycobacterium smegmatis, as well as cytotoxic activity against different human cancer cell lines of lung, ovary, breast, prostrate, neuroblastoma and colon.","J","Bhagat, J; Kaur, A; Sharma, M; Saxena, AK; Chadha, BS",NA,"","","Bhagat, Jyoti; Kaur, Amarjeet; Sharma, Madhunika; Saxena, A.

"The aim of the present study was to screen for antimicrobial activity in endophytic fungi isolated from surface sterilized leaves and branches of five Garcillia plants, G. atroviridis, G. dulcis, G. mangostana, G. nigrolineata and G. scortechinii, found in southern Thailand. Fermentation broths from 377 isolated fungi were tested for antimicrobial activity by the agar diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were obtained for crude ethyl acetate extracts. Seventy isolates (18.6%) displayed antimicrobial activity against at least one pathogenic microorganism, such as Staphylococcus aureus, a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, C. andida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. The results revealed that 6-10%, 1-2% and 18% of the crude ethyl acetate extracts inhibited both strains of S. aureus (MIC 32-512 mu g mL(-1)), Ca. albicans and Cr. neoformans (MIC 64-200 mu g ml(-1)), and Microsporum gypseum (MIC 2-64 mu g mL(-1)), respectively. Isolates D15 and M76 displayed the strongest antibacterial activity against both strains of S. aureus. Isolates M76 and N24 displayed strong antiftingal activity against M. gypseum. Fungal molecular identification based on internal transcribed spacer rRNA gene sequence analysis demonstrated that isolates D15 (DQ480353), M76 (DQ480360) and N24 (DQ480361) represented Phomopsis sp., Botryosphaeria sp. and an unidentified fungal endophyte, respectively. These results indicate that some endophytic fungi from Garcinia plants are a potential source of antimicrobial agents.","J","Phongpaichit, S; Rungjindamai, N; Rukachaisirikul, V; Sakayaroj, J",NA,"","","Phongpaichit, Souwalak; Rungjindamai, Nattawut; Rukachaisirikul, Vatcharin; Sakayaroj, Jariya",NA,NA,"Antimicrobial activity in cultures of endophytic fungi isolated from Garcinia species","FEMS IMMUNOLOGY AND MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rungjindamai, Nattawut/GQG-8746-2022; Rukachaisirikul, Vatcharin/AAX-8587-2020; Sakayaroj, Jariya/D-1845-2012","Rungjindamai, Nattawut/0000-0002-2610-3214;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0928-8244","1574-695X","",NA,NA,"DEC",2006,48,"3",NA,"","",NA,"367","372","","10.1111/j.1574-695X.2006.00155.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-695X.2006.00155.x","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,17052267,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000242487500009","View Full Record in Web of Science",104,"Presence"
"Antibiotic resistance is a health problem experienced by living things, caused by long-term use of antibiotics. Thallasia hemprichii contains metabolites that have potential in the pharmaceutical field. Many studies show that seagrass has the activity of natural bioactive compounds as antifouling, antibacterial, and anti-fungal. The purpose of this study was to determine the number of isolates, morphological characteristics of endophytic fungi and to determine the antagonistic activity they produce against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli test bacteria. The study began on April -September 2021 using samples from the waters of Malang Rapat Village. The type of research conducted is descriptive. There were 4 stages of research, namely taking and preparation of roots and leaves of seagrass as hosts for endophytic fungi, isolation of endophytic fungi using direct planting method, observation of fungal morphology, and fungal antagonist test using the method of antagonist by fungi against test bacteria. The results obtained 3 isolates from root samples and 7 isolates from leaves, with isolates with septal hyphae belonging to D32.1, D32.2, A37, A35, A21, and D45.

"In the natural products research, a valuable approach is the prospection of uncommon sources and unexplored habitat. Special attention has been given to endophytic fungi because of their ability to produce new and interesting secondary metabolites, which have several biological applications. The endophytes establish exclusive symbiotic relationships with plants and the metabolic interactions may support the synthesis of some similar valuables compounds. Among secondary metabolites, phenol-derived structures are responsible for several bioactivities such as antioxidant, cytotoxic, antimicrobial, among others. Phenolic compounds might be biosynthesized from the shikimate pathway. Although shikimic acid is a common precursor in plants, it is described as rare in microorganisms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review about phenolic compounds produced by endophytic fungi and a comparison has been made with those produced by the plant host. This review covers 124 phenolic secondary metabolites produced by endophytic fungi. Considering the data analyzed by us, only seven of such compounds were isolated from fungi and from their hosts. These observations claim for more attention to phenolic compounds produced by endophytic fungi with a view to understand the real importance of these compounds to endophytes survival.","J","de Carvalho, PLN; Silva, ED; Chagas-Paula, DA; Luiz, JHH; Ikegaki, M",NA,"","","Negreiros de Carvalho, Patrcia Lunardelli; Silva, Eliane de Oliveira; Chagas-Paula, Daniela Aparecida; Hortolan Luiz, Jaine Honorata; Ikegaki, Masaharu",NA,NA,"Importance and Implications of the Production of Phenolic Secondary Metabolites by Endophytic Fungi: A Mini-Review","MINI-REVIEWS IN MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Luiz, Jaine H H/E-5599-2013; Ikegaki, Masaharu/R-2540-2019; Silva, Eliane/S-2675-2019; de Carvalho, Patrícia L.N./A-4056-2013; Chagas-Paula, Daniela/O-1754-2013","Luiz, Jaine H H/0000-0002-0448-5004; Silva, Eliane/0000-0001-9121-0481; Chagas-Paula, Daniela/0000-0003-2274-4919; Ikegaki, Masaharu/0000-0003-0688-1518",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1389-5575","1875-5607","",NA,NA,"",2016,16,"4",NA,"","",NA,"259","271","","10.2174/1389557515666151016123923","http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1389557515666151016123923","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,26471971,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000369072600001","View Full Record in Web of Science",106,"Review"
"L-asparaginase is an important anticancer enzyme that is used in the first line treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This study was conducted to isolate L-asparaginase-producing endophytic fungi from medicinal plants of family Asteraceae. Seven healthy medicinal plants from family Asteraceae were selected for the isolation of endophytic fungi using standard surface sterilization techniques. A total of 837 isolates belonging to 84 species were comprised of the stem (55.6%), leaf (31.1%), root (10.6%) and flower (2.7%). Initial screening of L-asparaginase-producing endophytes was performed by qualitative plate assay on modified Czapex dox's agar medium. L-asparaginase activity of fungal endophytes was quantified by the nesslerization method. Identification of endophytic fungi was performed using both morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data including ribosomal DNA regions of ITS (Internal transcribed spacer) and LSU (partial large subunit rDNA), TEF1 (Translation Elongation Factor) and TUB (beta-tubulin). Of the 84 isolates, 38 were able to produce L-asparaginase and their L-asparaginase activities were between 0.019 and 0.492 unit/mL with Fusarium proliferatum being the most potent. L-asparaginase-producing endophytes were identified as species of Plectosphaerella, Fusarium, Stemphylium, Septoria, Alternaria, Didymella, Phoma, Chaetosphaeronema, Sarocladium, Nemania, Epicoccum, Ulocladium and Cladosporium. This study showed that endophytic fungi from Asteraceae members have a high L-asparaginase-producing potential and they can be used as an alternative source for production of anticancer enzymes.","J","Hatamzadeh, S; Rahnama, K; Nasrollahnejad, S; Fotouhifar, KB; Hemmati, K; White, JF; Taliei, F",NA,"","","Hatamzadeh, Sareh; Rahnama, Kamran; Nasrollahnejad, Saeed; Fotouhifar, Khalil Berdi; Hemmati, Khodayar; White, James F.; Taliei, Fakhtalc",NA,NA,"Isolation and identification of L-asparaginase-producing endophytic fungi from the Asteraceae family plant species of Iran","PEERJ","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Fotouhifar, Khalil-Berdi/ABH-1857-2021; Taliei, Fakhtak/ABG-8927-2021","Fotouhifar, Khalil-Berdi/0000-0002-4790-6171; Taliei, Fakhtak/0000-0001-9043-6745",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2167-8359","","",NA,NA,"JAN 14",2020,8,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","e8309","10.7717/peerj.8309","http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8309","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31976175,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000507477600001","View Full Record in Web of Science",107,"Presence"
"Heavy metal contamination in soil is increasing rapidly due to increasing anthropogenic activities. Despite the importance of rose-scented geranium as a medicinal plant, little attention was paid to enhancing its productivity in heavy metal-polluted soil. In this regard, endophytes improve plant resistance to heavy metal toxicity and enhance its tissue quality. Here, the impact of the three endophytic fungi Talaromyces versatilis (E6651), Emericella nidulans (E6658), and Aspergillus niger (E6657) on geranium growth, tolerance, and tissue quality under cadmium (Cd) stress was investigated. In contrast to E. nidulans, T. versatilis and A. niger enhanced geranium growth and the stimulatory effect was more pronounced under Cd-stress. The three endophytes significantly alleviated Cd accumulation and increased mineral content in geranium leaves. In addition, endophytic fungi successfully alleviated Cd-induced membrane damage and reinforced the antioxidant defenses in geranium leaves. Inoculation with endophytes stimulated all the antioxidant enzymes under Cd-stress, and the response was more obvious in the case of T. versatilis and A. niger. To reduce the toxicity of tissue-Cd levels, T. versatilis and A. niger upregulated the detoxification mechanisms; glutathione-S-transferase, phytochelatin, and metallothionein levels. Moreover, endophytic fungi improved the medicinal value and quality of geranium by increasing total antioxidant capacity (TAC), phenolic compound biosynthesis (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase), and vitamin content as well as the quantity and quality of essential oil, particularly under Cd-stress conditions. The variation in the mechanisms modulated by the different endophytic fungi was supported by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Overall, this study provided fundamental insights into endophytes' impact as a feasible strategy to mitigate the phytotoxicity hazards of Cd-stress in geranium and enhance its quality, based on the growth and biochemical investigations.","J","El-Shafey, NM; Marzouk, MA; Yasser, MM; Shaban, SA; Beemster, GTS; AbdElgawad, H",NA,"","","El-Shafey, Nadia Mohamed; Marzouk, Marym A.; Yasser, Manal M.; Shaban, Salwa A.; Beemster, Gerrit T.

"The growth and yield of crops are severely threatened by drought stress. As the symbiotic partners of plants, the function of the symbiotic interaction between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM fungi) and endophytic fungi on host drought resistance is still unclear. Through high-throughput sequencing of peanuts cultivated in a natural soil environment with different soil water conditions, our study showed that the inoculation of an endophytic fungus not only reassembled the root-dwelling AM fungal community by driving the colonization of Gigaspora, but also enhanced peanut drought resistance under drought stress. Co-inoculation experiments revealed that the synergetic interaction between the endophytic fungus and the AM fungi promoted the ecological service of the extraradical hyphae of Gigaspora margarita. In addition, both endophytic fungal exudates and root exudates failed to differentially affect the pre-symbiotic growth of different AM fungi. Overall, our study enabled us to better understand the ecological importance of the tripartite symbiosis between endophytic fungi, AM fungi and the host.

"A sensitive and efficient colorimetric method was optimized for detection of esterase enzymes produced by endophytic fungi for development of High-Throughput Screening (HTS). The fungi were isolated and obtained previously from plant species of Cerrado and Atlantic Forest located in areas of environmental preservation in the State of Sao Paulo / Brazil, as part of the project Chemical and biological prospecting endophytic fungi associated to plant species of Cerrado and Atlantic Forest. The compounds ethyl butyrate, ethyl acetate and methyl propionate were used as standards esters which were hydrolyzed by extracellular enzyme from endophytic fungi (EC. 3.1.1.1 - carboxylesterases) for production of carboxylic acids. Thus, the reduction of the pH increases the protonated indicator concentration (bromothymol blue), changing the color of the reaction medium (from blue to yellow), that can be observed and measured by spectrophotometry at 616 nm. The methodology with acid-base indicator was performed on 13 microorganisms, aiming Periconia atropurpurea as a potential source of esterase for biotransformation of short chain esters. The results also evidenced that this methodology showed to be efficient, fast, cheap, having low consumption of reagents and easy development, and can be applied to screen carboxylic-ester hydrolases in a large number of microorganisms.","J","Lisboa, HCF; Biasetto, CR; de Medeiros, JB; Araújo, AR; Silva, DHS; Teles, HL; Trevisan, HC",NA,"","","Favero Lisboa, Helen Cristina; Biasetto, Carolina Rabal; de Medeiros, Joao Batista; Araujo, Angela Regina; Siqueira Silva, Dulce Helena; Teles, Helder Lopes; Trevisan, Henrique Celso",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi producing of esterases: Evaluation in vitro of the enzymatic activity using pH indicator","BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Silva, Dulce Helena Siqueira/AAZ-5978-2020; Silva, Dulce H S/F-2626-2012; Araujo, Angela R/E-6298-2012; TELES, HELDER LOPES/H-7896-2016","Silva, Dulce Helena Siqueira/0000-0002-1516-7765; Silva, Dulce H S/0000-0002-1516-7765; Araujo, Angela R./0000-0001-7616-9652",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1517-8382","1678-4405","",NA,NA,"JUL-SEP",2013,44,"3",NA,"","",NA,"923","926","","10.1590/S1517-83822013005000067","http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1517-83822013005000067","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24516461,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000332062100042","View Full Record in Web of Science",111,"Presence"
"Gentiana macrophylla is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant. Its dominant active constituents are secoiridoids, mainly gentiopicrin. The objective of this study was to determine whether endophytic fungi isolated from this plant produce the bioactive ingredient gentiopicrin. Primary screening was done by Dragendorff's reaction and the strain re-selection was done with thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to identify the fermentation products of the selected strains. In this study, 20 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated from G. macrophylla, and the extracts from five strains had a positive Dragendorff's reaction. Two strains (QJ 16 and QJ18) had a component with the same R-f value in TLC as that of authentic gentiopicrin and one ingredient of the QJ18 extract had a retention time identical with that of authentic gentiopicrin in HPLC. Therefore, the fungus appears to produce the bioactive ingredient gentiopicrin, as does its host plant, and could be used for the production of gentiopicrin by fermentation. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

"Plant endophytic fungi spend all or part of their lives inside host tissues without causing disease symptoms. They can colonize the plant to protect against predators, pathogens and abiotic stresses generated by drought, salinity, high concentrations of heavy metals, UV radiation and temperature fluctuations. They can also promote plant growth through the biosynthesis of phytohormones and nutrient acquisition. In recent years, the study of endophytic fungi for biological control of plant diseases and pests has been intensified to try to reduce the ecological and public health impacts due the use of chemicals and the emergence of fungicide resistance. In this review, we examine 185 patents related to endophytic fungi (from January 1988 to December 2019) and discuss their applicability for abiotic stress tolerance and growth promotion of plants, as agents for biocontrol of herbivores and plant pathogens and bio- and phytoremediation applications.","J","Ortega, HE; Torres-Mendoza, D; Cubilla-Rios, L",NA,"","","Ortega, Humberto E.; Torres-Mendoza, Daniel; Cubilla-Rios, Luis",NA,NA,"Patents on Endophytic Fungi for Agriculture and Bio- and Phytoremediation Applications","MICROORGANISMS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Torres-Mendoza, Daniel/AAU-7741-2020; Cubilla-Rios, Luis/AAU-8928-2021","Cubilla-Rios, Luis/0000-0003-1666-8948; Torres-Mendoza, Daniel/0000-0002-3540-4238; Ortega-Dominguez, Humberto/0000-0003-1385-0103",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2076-2607","",NA,NA,"AUG",2020,8,"8",NA,"","",NA,"","","1237","10.3390/microorganisms8081237","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8081237","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32823804,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000567127500001","View Full Record in Web of Science",113,"Review"
"The interaction between aboveground and belowground biotic communities drives community assembly of plants and soil microbiota. As an important component of belowground microorganisms, root-associated fungi play pivotal roles in biodiversity maintenance and community assembly of host plants. The Betulaceae plants form ectomycorrhizae with soil fungi and widely distribute in various ecosystems. However, the community assembly of endophytic fungi in ectomycorrhizae is less investigated at a large spatial scale. Here, we examined the endophytic fungal communities in ectomycorrhizae of 22 species in four genera belonging to Betulaceae in Chinese forest ecosystems, using Illumina Miseq sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 2 amplicons. The relative contribution of host phylogeny, climate and soil (environmental filtering) and geographic distance (dispersal limitation) on endophytic fungal community was disentangled. In total, 2,106 endophytic fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained at a 97% sequence similarity level, dominated by Leotiomycetes, Agaricomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, and Sordariomycetes. The endophytic fungal OTU richness was significantly related with host phylogeny, geographic distance, soil and climate. The endophytic fungal community composition was significantly affected by host phylogeny (19.5% of variation explained in fungal community), geographic distance (11.2%), soil (6.1%), and climate (1.4%). This finding suggests that environmental filtering by plant and abiotic variables coupled with dispersal limitation linked to geographic distance determines endophytic fungal community assembly in ectomycorrhizae of Betulaceae plants, with host phylogeny being a stronger determinant than other predictor variables at the regional scale.","J","Wang, YL; Gao, C; Chen, L; Ji, NN; Wu, BW; Lü, PP; Li, XC; Qian, X; Maitra, P; Babalola, BJ; Zheng, Y; Guo, LD",NA,"","","Wang, Yong-Long; Gao, Cheng; Chen, Liang; Ji, Niu-Niu; Wu, Bin-Wei; Lu, Peng-Peng; Li, Xing-Chun; Qian, Xin; Maitra, Pulak; Babalola, Busayo Joshua; Zheng, Yong; Guo, Liang-Dong",NA,NA,"Community Assembly of Endophytic Fungi in Ectomycorrhizae of Betulaceae Plants at a Regional Scale","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Lu, Peng/HNR-4786-2023; Babalola, Busayo Joshua/AHC-6478-2022; Chen, Liang/AES-9965-2022; Zheng, Yong/AAN-8928-2021; Maitra, Pulak/HHM-2122-2022; Wang, Yonglong/HRA-8995-2023; Babalola, Busayo/HNS-7900-2023; Zheng, Yong/E-3947-2012; Lu, Xiaomei/IUQ-2139-2023; Gao 高程, Cheng/J-9586-2012","Chen, Liang/0000-0002-5706-6559; Zheng, Yong/0000-0001-5239-9824; Maitra, Pulak/0000-0001-7141-1497; Babalola, Busayo/0000-0002-7331-8154; Zheng, Yong/0000-0001-5239-9824; Gao 高程, Cheng/0000-0003-2522-7909; Qian, Xin/0000-0001-5685-3588",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1664-302X","",NA,NA,"JAN 21",2020,10,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","3105","10.3389/fmicb.2019.03105","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.03105","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32038548,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000511329400001","View Full Record in Web of Science",114,"Presence"
"Saikosaponin d (SSd) is an important bioactive compound of traditional Chinese medicinal plant Bupleurum scorzonerifolium Willd. and exhibits many effects, such as anti-tumor, anti-inflammation and immunomodulatory. Since endophytic fungi possess the natural capacity to produce the similar secondary metabolite to that of their host plants, they are promising as alternative sources of plant bioactive natural products. In this study, in order to search for SSd-producing strains, endophytes were isolated from B. scorzonerifolium and were authenticated by the ITS sequence and the translation elongation factor-1alpha gene (TEF-1 alpha) sequence analysis. The profile of metabolites present in the crude exacts was carried out by ultra performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) analysis. The results showed that two strains, CHS2 and CHS3 from B. scorzonerifolium could produce SSd by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS analysis, and the amount of SSd produced by strain CHS2 and CHS3 were about 2.17 and 2.40 mu g/mL, respectively. CHS2 and CHS3 showed a close phylogenetic relationship to Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium acuminatum, respectively. According to our concern, no endophytic fungi capable of producing SSd from B. scorzonerifolium have been found before. Our clear intention was to isolate and identify these endophytic fungi that produce important active secondary metabolites, and then study the strains that produce this compound on a large scale through fermentation or even genetic study, to provide a feasible and more convenient way for the production of SSd.","J","Cheng, YP; Liu, GJ; Li, ZM; Zhou, YQ; Gao, N",NA,"","","Cheng, Yupeng; Liu, Guangjie; Li, Zhongmeng; Zhou, Yongqiang; Gao, Ning",NA,NA,"Screening saikosaponin d (SSd)-producing endophytic fungi from Bupleurum scorzonerifolium Willd","WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0959-3993","1573-0972","",NA,NA,"DEC",2022,38,"12",NA,"","",NA,"","","242","10.1007/s11274-022-03434-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-022-03434-x","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36280622,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000871419600002","View Full Record in Web of Science",115,"Presence"
"Due to increasingly limited water resources, diminishing farmland acreage, and potentially negative effects of climate change, an urgent need exists to improve agricultural productivity to feed the ever-growing population. Plants interact with microorganisms at all trophic levels, adapting growth, developmental, and defense responses within a complicated network of community members. Endophytic fungi have been widely reported for their ability to aid in the defense of their host plants. Currently, many reports focus on the application of endophytic fungi with the capability to produce valuable bioactive molecules, while others focus on endophytic fungi as biocontrol agents. Plant responses upon endophytic fungi colonization are also good for the immune system of the plant. In this paper, the possible mechanisms between endophytic fungi and their hosts were reviewed. During long-term evolution, plants have acquired numerous beneficial strategies in response to endophytic fungi colonization. The interaction of endophytic fungi with plants modulates the relationship between plants and both biotic and abiotic stresses. It has previously been reported that this endophytic relationship confers additional defensive mechanisms on the modulation of the plant immune system, as the result of the manipulation of direct antimicrobial metabolites such as alkaloids to indirect phytohormones, jasmonic acid, or salicylic acid. Furthermore, plants have evolved to cope with combinations of stresses and experiments are required to address specific questions related to these multiple stresses. This review summarizes our current understanding of the intrinsic mechanism to better utilize these benefits for plant growth and disease resistance. It contributes new ideas to increase plant fitness and crop productivity.","J","Yan, L; Zhu, J; Zhao, XX; Shi, JL; Jiang, CM; Shao, DY",NA,"","","Yan, Lu; Zhu, Jing; Zhao, Xixi; Shi, Junling; Jiang, Chunmei; Shao, Dongyan",NA,NA,"Beneficial effects of endophytic fungi colonization on plants","APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"yan, Lu/IQV-1421-2023","Shi, Junling/0000-0002-4643-1792",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0175-7598","1432-0614","",NA,NA,"MAR",2019,103,"8",NA,"","",NA,"3327","3340","","10.1007/s00253-019-09713-2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-019-09713-2","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30847542,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000463608200008","View Full Record in Web of Science",116,"Review"
"In order to explore whether endophytic fungi of Casuarina equisetifolia L. are involved in allelopathy, we investigated their diversity and composition of their metabolites. By Illumina Miseq high-throughput sequencing platform, a total of 318,972 sequences were obtained from 9 root samples of C. equisetifolia of different ages, which included 11 phyla, 32 families and 32 genera. Four fungi were isolated from the roots by the traditional method and identified by biolog microbial automatic analysis system as Aspergillus aculeatus lzuka, Penicillium melinii Thom, Neosartorya fisccheri (Wehmer) Malloch & Cain BGA and Penicillium solitum Westling BGB. Pyrogallic acid, dodecanoic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid, 2,4-Di-tert-butylphenol, 1,2,3,4-butanetetrol and globulol and other organic compounds were identified in the fermentation broths of four endophytic fungi by GC-MS analysis. Among them, 2, 4-Ditert-butylphenol, 1,2,3,4-butanetetrol and globulol were also found in soil, root and litter extract. These results imply that root-endophytic fungi are involved in the synthesis of substances that affect the host plants.

"Fungal endophytes were identified associated with leaves, stems and roots of wild grasses (Poaceae) and sedges (Cyperaceae) residing in Hyrcanian Forests, some of the most unique and unspoiled forest systems in the world. The plants grew in two climatically-distinct regions of Golestan and Semnan provinces of Iran. Endophytic fungi isolated from these plants were categorised into 27 morphogroups based on physical attributes measured in vitro. Sequence diversity was estimated from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA gene. Of the 53 isolates characterised in this study, identification of only one isolate was conclusive at the species level. Twenty-eight isolates were identified to the level of genus, belonging to seven families and six orders, six isolates to the level of family, 13 at the level of order, one to the super family, and four to the subphylum. Members of the genera Fusarium and Alternaria, and of the families Necteriaceae, Pleosporaceae and Trichocomaceae were the most abundant fungal endophytes identified.

"BackgroundEndophytic fungi play a vital role in plant defense system by secreting various antimicrobial agents. To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the endophytic fungi of the mangrove plant Heritiera fomes (Buch. -Ham), plants were collected from the Sundarbans, Bangladesh. The endophytic fungi were subsequently isolated and identified.ResultsFifty-five endophytic fungi were isolated from the leaves, root, and bark of H. fomes (Buch. -Ham). Genomic DNA was extracted for PCR (polymerase chain reaction) by specific primers to multiply ITS region and sequences were determined. Nucleotide sequence data were submitted to the Genbank and accession number for each fungal strain was obtained. Antimicrobial activity of the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and methanolic extracts of eleven species from both fermentation and mycelium, respectively, were analyzed by microtiter plate-based antimicrobial assay incorporating resazurin as an indicator of cell growth against two Gram-positive bacteria namely Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 12981 and Micrococcus luteus NCTC 7508, two Gram-negative bacteria namely Escherichia coli NCTC 12241 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 12903, and a fungus Candida albicans ATCC 90028. All the endophytic fungal extracts exhibited antimicrobial activities against more than one-tested pathogenic microbial strains. Overall, methanolic extracts showed greater activity than EtOAc extracts. Pseudopestalotiopsis camelliae-sinensis, Pestalotiopsis microspora, and Penicillium copticola were the most active endophytic fungal strains and exhibited strong inhibitory activity against the microorganisms under investigation and their MIC values ranged from 0.0024 to 5.0mg/mL. Methanolic extracts of both P. camelliae-sinensis and P. microspora showed the highest antibacterial activity (MIC value of 0.0024mg/mL) against P. aeruginosa NCTC 12903.ConclusionThis study showed that the isolated and identified endophytic fungi from H. fomes (Buch. -Ham) could be potential sources of antimicrobial agents.","J","Nurunnabi, TR; Sarwar, S; Sabrin, F; Alam, F; Nahar, L; Sohrab, H; Sarker, SD; Rahman, SMM; Billah, M",NA,"","","Nurunnabi, Tauhidur Rahman; Sarwar, Sabiha; Sabrin, Farah; Alam, Farzana; Nahar, Lutfun; Sohrab, Hossain; Sarker, Satyajit D.; Rahman, S.

"About 63 fungal endophytic isolates were separated from rhizomes of Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis, which is a traditional medicinal plant mainly distributed in China. The isolates were characterized and grouped based on the culture characteristics and the morphology of colony growth and conidia. Eleven representative ones were selected for further taxonomical identification. Five genera namely Fusarium, Gliocladiopsis, Gliomastix, Aspergillus and Cylindrocarpon were identified on the basis of their morphological characterizations. Of them, the most frequent genus was Fusarium (i.e. Ppf1, Ppf3 and Ppf14). Their ITS-rDNA sequences were compared with those available in the GeneBank databases to obtain the closest related species by BLAST analysis as well as to analyze their phylogenetic affiliation. The isolates were identified as Gliocladiopsis irregularis (Ppf2), Plectosphaerella cucumerina (Ppf4), Padospora sp.

"Main conclusionEF have been explored for its beneficial impact on environment and for its commercial applications. It has proved its worth in these sectors and showed an impact on biological properties of plants by producing various bioactive molecules and enzymes.Endophytes are plant mutualists that live asymptomatically within plant tissues and exist in almost every plant species. Endophytic fungi benefit from the host plant nutrition, and the host plant gains improved competitive abilities and tolerance against pathogens, herbivores, and various abiotic stresses. Endophytic fungi are one of the most inventive classes which produce secondary metabolites and play a crucial role in human health and other biotic aspects. This review is focused on systematic study on the biodiversity of endophytic fungi in plants, and their role in enhancing various properties of plants such as antimicrobial, antimycobacterial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, anticancer, and biological activity of secondary metabolites produced by various fungal endophytes in host plants reported from 1994 to 2021. This review emphasizes the endophytic fungal population shaped by host genotype, environment, and endophytic fungi genotype affecting host plant. The impact of endophytic fungi has been discussed in detail which influences the commercial properties of plants. Endophytes also have an influence on plant productivity by increasing parameters such as nutrient recycling and phytostimulation. Studies focusing on mechanisms that regulate attenuation of secondary metabolite production in EF would provide much needed impetus on ensuring continued production of bioactive molecules from a indubitable source. If this knowledge is further extensively explored regarding fungal endophytes in plants for production of potential phytochemicals, then it will help in exploring a keen area of interest for pharmacognosy.","J","Devi, R; Verma, R; Dhalaria, R; Kumar, A; Kumar, D; Puri, S; Thakur, M; Chauhan, S; Chauhan, PP; Nepovimova, E; Kuca, K",NA,"","","Devi, Reema; Verma, Rachna; Dhalaria, Rajni; Kumar, Ashwani; Kumar, Dinesh; Puri, Sunil; Thakur, Monika; Chauhan, Saurav; Chauhan, Prem Parkash; Nepovimova, Eugenie; Kuca, Kamil",NA,NA,"A systematic review on endophytic fungi and its role in the commercial applications","PLANTA","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kuca, Kamil/D-1396-2011; Verma, Rachna/AAA-6251-2021","Kuca, Kamil/0000-0001-9664-1109; Verma, Rachna/0000-0001-5321-9450",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0032-0935","1432-2048","",NA,NA,"APR",2023,257,"4",NA,"","",NA,"","","70","10.1007/s00425-023-04087-2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00425-023-04087-2","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36856911,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000941939100001","View Full Record in Web of Science",124,"Review"
"BackgroundMany studies have been carried out on the growth-modulating efficiency of plants by the colonization of an endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica. However, studies involving the co-culture of alga with endophytic fungal strains for enhanced biodiesel production are rare. In this study, the interaction between P. indica and Parachlorella kessleri-I, a marine algal strain, was assessed at metabolic level.ResultsIn association with an endophytic fungus, the algal biomass enhanced from 471.6 to 704mg/L, and the fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profile of P. kessleri-I increased substantially. In case of FAME profile of co-cultured P. kessleri-I, two essential components of biodiesel, i.e. elaidic acid and oleic acid, increased by 1.4- and 1.8-fold, respectively. To ascertain changes in the metabolic profile of P. kessleri-I by P. indica co-culture, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics study was performed to identify the metabolites involved; and differential nature of the essential metabolites was also confirmed using HPLC and LC-MS. Significant modulation of the bioactive metabolites such as succinate, oxo-propanoate, l-alanine, glutamate, acetate and 1,2 propanediol, hydroxy butane was observed.ConclusionThe metabolites like glutamate and succinate that usually belong to the GABA shunt pathway were observed to be upregulated. The pathway links nitrogen metabolism and carbon metabolism, thus influencing the growth and lipid profile of the algae. These differential metabolites thus indicated the important commensal association between the endophytic fungus and autotrophic marine alga, and established that endophytic fungus can be handy for the sustainability of algal biofuel industries.","J","Bhatnagar, VS; Bandyopadhyay, P; Rajacharya, GH; Sarkar, S; Poluri, KM; Kumar, S",NA,"","","Bhatnagar, Vipul Swarup; Bandyopadhyay, Prasun; Rajacharya, Girish H.; Sarkar, Sharanya; Poluri, Krishna Mohan; Kumar, Shashi",NA,NA,"Amelioration of biomass and lipid in marine alga by an endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica","BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Poluri, Krishna Mohan/H-6083-2013","Poluri, Krishna Mohan/0000-0003-3801-7134; Kumar, Shashi/0000-0001-7192-1526; Swarup Bhatnagar, Vipul/0000-0001-5133-261X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1754-6834","","",NA,NA,"JUL 8",2019,12,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","176","10.1186/s13068-019-1516-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13068-019-1516-6","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31316583,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000475526900001","View Full Record in Web of Science",125,"Presence"
"Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common systemic diseases in the world, and it occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or does not make enough insulin. As described by the World Health Organization, diabetes mellitus of all types has exponentially grown in the past decades across the globe and it is estimated to be 629 million by 2045. Despite this alarming prevalence of diabetes mellitus, there is still the lack of harmless preventive medicines. Natural products and compounds obtained from plants, fungi, bacteria, and other living organisms have been used for many decades in folklore medicine to prepare a varied range of natural formulations to treat multiple diseases and illnesses. Endophytic fungi reside inside the plant while causing no harm to the host plant and are relatively less explored as the primary source for the bioactive metabolites such as anticancer, antioxidant, antimicrobial, antidiabetic, and industrial enzymes. This mini-review summarizes the potential of compounds and extracts from endophytic fungi against diabetes mellitus. Not much research has been dedicated in-depth understanding of the role of extracts of endophytic fungi and their effect on diabetes mellitus. Therefore, this article will focus on recent work and warrant further commentaries on the published articles.","J","Agrawal, S; Samanta, S; Deshmukh, SK",NA,"","","Agrawal, Shivankar; Samanta, Sreeparna; Deshmukh, Sunil Kumar",NA,NA,"The antidiabetic potential of endophytic fungi: Future prospects as therapeutic agents","BIOTECHNOLOGY AND APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"AGRAWAL, SHIVANKAR/AAT-1977-2020; Deshmukh, Dr. Sunilkumar/M-3504-2018","AGRAWAL, SHIVANKAR/0000-0002-1584-691X; Deshmukh, Dr. Sunilkumar/0000-0001-5395-9512",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0885-4513","1470-8744","",NA,NA,"JUN",2022,69,"3",NA,"","",NA,"1159","1165","","10.1002/bab.2192","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bab.2192","","MAY 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33998044,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000653666200001","View Full Record in Web of Science",126,"Review"
"It is currently unclear whether the mechanism of endophytic fungi improving the alkali tolerance of Hordeum bogdanii affects secondary metabolites. Unveiling this knowledge is crucial for understanding the tolerance mechanism of H. bogdanii to alkaline stress. The aim of this study was to investigate how endophytic fungi affect secondary metabolites of H. bogdanii under alkaline stress at different concentrations. Endophyte-infected (E +) and endophyte-free (E-) individuals of H. bogdanii were used as materials in this study. The method of indoor vermiculite aseptic planting was adopted. After mixed alkali stress treatment, the roots, stems, and leaves of the plants were collected to measure the indicators related to secondary metabolites. The results showed that endophytic fungi improved the alkali resistance of H. bogdanii by improving the related indicators of secondary metabolites. endophytic fungi significantly increased the contents of phosphorus, polyphenols, and alkaloids, and the activities of polyphenol oxidase and acid phosphatase, and significantly reduced flavonoid content. The content of polyphenols and alkaloids in stems, polyphenol oxidase activity in stems and leaves, and acid phosphatase activity in leaves were significantly affected. The findings of this study may aid in amplifying the alkali resistance mechanism of endophytic fungi to H. bogdanii as well as provide insights into improving the alkali resistance of other plants.","J","Han, D; Wang, K; Long, F; Zhang, WB; Yao, X; Chen, SH",NA,"","","Han, Dan; Wang, Kai; Long, Feng; Zhang, Wangbin; Yao, Xiang; Chen, Shuihong",NA,NA,"Effects of endophytic fungi on the secondary metabolites of Hordeum bogdanii under alkaline stress","AMB EXPRESS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Long, Feng/AAN-4694-2021","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2191-0855","","",NA,NA,"JUN 14",2022,12,"1",NA,"","",NA,"","","73","10.1186/s13568-022-01414-w","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13568-022-01414-w","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35701557,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000811194100001","View Full Record in Web of Science",127,"Presence"
"Endophytes are bacteria or fungi which live inside the host plant and participate in many biological processes without causing disease or other adverse effects. Endophytes are recognised as a rich source of secondary metabolites with potentially useful pharmacological properties. Many South African medicinal plants are highly under-investigated sources of potentially useful endophytic microbes. In this report six endophytic fungi were obtained from the leaves, stems and roots of South African medicinal plants which are known for their traditional uses and pharmacological properties. The endophytic fungi were isolated from Cotyledon orbiculata L., Psychotria zombamontana (Kuntze) Petit, Tecomaria capensis (Thunb.) Lindl., Catha edulis (Vahl) Endl. and Melianthus comosus Vahl. The crude extracts of the isolated endophytic fungi were investigated for their antimicrobial potential, extracellular enzymatic activity and phosphate solubilization. Additionally, the present study used genetic screening to assess the ability of the endophytic fungi to synthesize bioactive compounds, indicated by the presence of the polyketide synthase type 1 (PKS 1) gene. In preliminary microbial inhibition screening the fungal extracts had promising antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans. Furthermore, the endophytic fungus Talaromyces funiculosus displayed extracellular enzymatic activity, namely xylanase and cellulase. Five fungal strains demonstrated ability to solubilize phosphate and three strains demonstrated the presence of polyketide synthase type 1 (PKS 1) gene. It is worth considering further investigation of their bioactive secondary metabolites. (c) 2020 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"Endophytic fungi are a taxonomically and ecologically heterogenous group of organisms; mainly belong to ascomycetes, coelomycetes and hypomycetes. The abundance of endophytic fungi in tropical regions has been studied. However, scant attentions have been given to medicinal plants of tropics. Synthesis of Indole acetic acid and metabolites showing antiviral, volatile metabolites, anticancer agents, anti-oxidants, insecticidal activities, antidiabetic and immunosuppressive compounds are widespread among the endophytic fungi. Now, more concentration has been given to the chemistry and bioactive compounds of endophytic fungi, mycodiversity and their ecological role.

"Foliar fungal endophytes are ubiquitous, but understudied symbionts of most plant species; relatively little is known about the factors affecting their occurrence, diversity and abundance. We tested the effects of soil nutrient content and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization on the occurrence of foliar endophytic fungi in Cirsium arvense in two field studies. In the first study, we assessed relationships between soil moisture, organic matter, carbon and nitrogen content and plant water, nitrogen and carbon content and AM colonization and the occurrence of foliar endophytic fungal species. In the second study, we manipulated soil nutrient content and AM colonization of potted seedlings and identified differences in endophytic fungal species composition of the leaves and stems. The results reveal that endophytes can occur either more or less frequently, de-pending on soil nutrient and plant water content and AM colonization. We propose that these patterns were the result of differences in fungal growth responses to nutrient availability in the leaves, which can be affected by resources obtained from the soil or symbiotic fungi in the roots.

"The biotransformation reactions are used as a successful alternative to derivatization by the traditional chemistry because they conduct to uncommon reactions, which would hardly be carried out by chemical synthesis. A wide diversity of compounds may be metabolized by fungi, leading to chemical derivatives through selective reactions that work under ecofriendly conditions. Endophytic fungi live in symbiosis with health tissues of plants. The employment of endophytic fungi as enzymatic sources to biotransformation reactions is very promising since these microorganisms came from uncommon and underexplored habitat. The environmental conditions directly influence the composition of the endophytic microbiota and its genetic expression, which could change also the production of the enzymes. The extraordinary richness of the Brazilian biodiversity is a key factor in the diversification of the endophytic community. The present review presents a mapping of the biotransformation reactions catalyzed by Brazilian endophytic fungi. Our findings contribute both to the appreciation of these fungi in the chemical derivatization and for the preservation of the Brazilian species.","J","dos Santos, VHP; Silva, ED",NA,"","","Pereira dos Santos, Valmore Henrique; Silva, Eliane de Oliveira",NA,NA,"ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI FROM THE BRAZILIAN FLORA AND THEIR EMPLOYMENT IN BIOTRANSFORMATION REACTIONS","QUIMICA NOVA","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Silva, Eliane/S-2675-2019","Silva, Eliane/0000-0001-9121-0481",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0100-4042","1678-7064","",NA,NA,"AUG",2019,42,"7",NA,"","",NA,"784","791","","10.21577/0100-4042.20170380","http://dx.doi.org/10.21577/0100-4042.20170380","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000483079600009","View Full Record in Web of Science",131,"Review"
"Arceuthobium americanum Nutt. ex Engelm. (lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe) is a dioecious plant parasitizing conifers in North America. Here, we documented changes in the taxonomic richness of culturable endophytic fungi in male and female A. americanum over the growing season. Endophytic fungi were isolated from vegetative stems of surface-sterilized aerial shoots from male and female A. americanum collected weekly from April to September. Isolated fungi were characterized macroscopically, generating a database of 48 morphologically unique forms that likely represented individual taxa. A random sample of endophytic fungi was sequenced to determine identity based on ITS rDNA. Richness increased throughout the growing season similarly in the stems of both sexes, suggesting that increased developmental age or time in the environment facilitates an increase in endophyte richness: male and female endophyte communities were 91% similar based on Sorensen's coefficient. Sequenced endophytes came from many diverse taxa, including Serpula, Alternaria, and Tremella, which may function as mutualistic symbionts within the mistletoe. An increase in fungal richness throughout the growing season has been observed in all flowering plants examined to date, although our observation is the first for the genus and for parasitic plants in general, and has also contributed to knowledge of fungal diversity in dioecious plants.","J","Hampel, LD; Cheeptham, N; Flood, NJ; Friedman, CR",NA,"","","Hampel, Lucas D.; Cheeptham, Naowarat; Flood, Nancy J.; Friedman, Cynthia Ross",NA,NA,"Plants, fungi, and freeloaders: examining temporal changes in the taxonomic richness of endophytic fungi in the dwarf mistletoe Arceuthobium americanum over its growing season","BOTANY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1916-2790","1916-2804","",NA,NA,"MAR",2017,95,"3",NA,"","SI",NA,"323","335","","10.1139/cjb-2016-0240","http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2016-0240","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000398183500011","View Full Record in Web of Science",132,"Presence"
"Aims: Endophytic fungi are the remarkable category of host-associated fungal community that invades the intercellular regions of host tissues, benefiting their host while obtaining an advantage. Fungal endophytes have lately attracted prominence as a source of active secondary metabolites. This investigation aimed to identify fungal endophytes that reside inside the leaves and stems of Aquilaria malaccensis.Methodology and results: Healthy A. malaccensis stems and leaves samples were collected. Clean leaves and stems were cut to a size of 1 cm, followed by sterilization using 75% ethanol for 1 min, 3% sodium hypochlorite solution for 1 min, and finally, rinsing with sterile water 3 times for 1 min and drying with sterile paper. The sterile samples were put onto Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) media containing chloramphenicol for 7-14 days until the mycelium grew for morphological identification under a light microscope. Five endophytic fungi were recovered from leaves, while nine endophytic fungi were obtained from stems. Using morphological approaches, nine of the endophytes had observed to produce conidia fungi, whereas the others did not. Neopestalotiopsis sp., Aspergillus sp., Arthrinium sp., Curvularia sp., Podospora sp., Mucor sp. and Verticillium sp. were identified as nine of the fourteen endophytes.Conclusion, significance and impact of study: The number of endophytic fungi discovered in different organs varies.

"The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), one of the most threatened mammalian species in the world, has adapted to herbivorous diet consisting mainly of bamboo (Poaceae: Bambusoidea). The most acute threats to the survival of the giant panda are habitat loss and fragmentation. However, changes in habitat may influence also the quality of giant panda diet through the bamboo species composition as well as their symbiotic leaf endophytes and plant chemical properties. Here we explore species composition and frequency of endophytic fungi and silica content in different bamboo species in the range of giant panda habitat in relation to panda food preference. Silica content of the bamboos varied from 3.7 g/kg to 45.7 g/kg and did not correlate with panda preference and altitudinal gradient. Systemic and vertically in seeds transmitted fungal endophytes or bacterial endophytes were not detected in bamboo leaves. Nearly half of the identified endophytic fungi belonged to genus Arthrinium. Pandas preferred bamboo species naturally occurring in higher altitudes. Furthermore, the total amount of endophytes tended to be lower in samples collected from bamboos in higher altitudes.

"Endophytic fungus represents microorganisms existing within the healthy plant organs, which can significantly influence metabolic product production in plants, a process with great research value and broad prospects for development. To investigate the effect of fermentation with probiotic cultures on the endophytic fungal diversity and composition of Astragalus membranaceus, we used single-molecular, real-time sequencing (Pacific Biosciences) for 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing. The results showed that the endophytic fungi of A. membranaceus mainly belonged to Aspergillus, Penicillium, Cystofilobasidium, Candida, Guehomyces, and Wallemia. Furthermore, the endophytic fungal diversity and abundance of A. membranaceus were more variable after fermentation with Enterococcus faecium and/or Lactobacillus plantarum.

"Medicines derived mostly from natural sources have played a major role in cancer chemotherapy for over 50 years. Against numerous ailments, plants have served as a source of bioactive compounds for centuries. However, it is not the plants themselves, but the microorganisms associated with them that offer material and products with high therapeutic potential. Endophytes are organisms that colonize internal plant tissues without causing disease symptoms. They constitute an endosymbiotic group of microorganisms which are the source of innovative natural products for use in modern industry, agriculture and medicine, indicating potential therapeutic properties, including anti-cancer and antimicrobial, as well as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Endophytic fungi are a rich source of bioactive metabolites that can be manipulated to obtain to produce desirable the desired new analogs used in chemotherapy, including: taxol, camptothecin, podophyllotoxin, vinblastine, vincristine, cytochalasin and many others.

"Endophytic fungi live symbiotically inside plants and are hidden source of natural bioactive molecules. The present study was carried out to investigate the phytochemical analysis and antioxidant activity of endophytic fungi isolated from the ethnomedicinal plant Dillenia indica L. The ethyl acetate crude extracts of the endophytic fungal strains were preliminarily evaluated for their phytochemical analysis, and the results showed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics, terpene, and saponins. The crude extracts of more than 60% of the isolates showed 50-90% antioxidant activity by DPPH and H2O2 assay. The inhibition percentage of ethyl acetate extracts ranges from 34.05 to 91.5%, whereas IC50 values vary from 72.2 to 691.14%. Among all the strains, Fomitopsis meliae crude extract showed a maximum inhibition percentage, i.e., 91.5%, with an IC50 value of 88.27 mu g/mL. Chaetomium globosum showed significant activity having an inhibition percentage of 89.88% and an IC50 value of 74.44 mu g/mL. The total phenolic and flavonoid content in the crude extract of Chaetomium globosum was 37.4 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g DW and 31.0 mg quercetin equivalent (GAE)/g DW. GC-MS analysis of crude extract of C. globosum revealed different compounds, such as squalene; butanoic acid, 2-methyl-; hexadecanoic acid; 2-propanone, 1-phenyl-; 5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester; 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (z)- etc. Many of these belong to phenolics, which are natural antioxidant compounds.

"Endophytic fungi inhabit plant tissues asymptomatically and confer a high diversity. They are polyphyletic in nature and primarily belong to the division Ascomycota. Endophytes are an important component of sustainable development in community ecology as they support the rich biodiversity and bioremediation of organic pollutants, wastewater, poisonous gases, industrial sewage, and heavy metals or in agricultural sufficiency. Endophytes are known to produce different kinds of secondary metabolites, and many of them are similar to what the host plants produce. Around 80% of the world's population, mostly those in the developing countries, still rely on herbal medicines for their primary healthcare. Usage of plant sources for commercial production of bioactive compounds requires sacrifice of several trees to obtain satisfactory amounts. This is more so if they were to be isolated from endemic and endangered plant species. Such an aspect poses a grave threat to biodiversity conservation and forces us to go for a judicious usage of plant resources. Hence, production of bioactive compounds by the microorganisms that are intrinsic to the host plant tissues gives us hope. This is because microbial fermentation is comparably cheaper and economically stable and offers a sustainable source to pharmaceutical industries. In this chapter current perspectives of endophytic fungi in sustainable usage such as bioactive compounds of therapeutic use, biotransformations, plant defense and protection mechanisms, biocontrol, and crop production and in sustainable development including nutrient recycling and ecosystem functioning are reviewed and discussed.","B","Mishra, R; Sarma, VV",NA,"Gehlot, P; Singh, J","","Mishra, Rashmi; Sarma, V.

"Endophytic fungi constitute an important source of structurally diverse and pharmacologically active secondary metabolites. Most medicinal plants possess antimicrobial activity and host a number of endophytic fungi used in defense mechanisms against attack by pathogens. The aim of this study was to determine biodiversity of endophytic fungi isolated from black seeds, using morphological and molecular-based tools. Each isolate was, thereafter, subjected to stress tolerance through varying conditions of pH (2,3 and 12), salinity (3%,8% and 10%) and temperature (2 degrees C,25 degrees C,37 degrees C and 50 degrees C). Four hundred and ninety-two (n=492) black seeds were used to isolate fungal strains on potato dextrose agar. A combination of microscopic examination and PCR amplification of Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS 1 and ITS 4) regions were used to identify fungal isolates. One hundred (n=100) endophytic fungi were successfully isolated with a 20% isolation rate. Under salt stress conditions, most isolates managed to grow at 3% concentration, representing 88% fungal growth, with a maximum of 75-80.5 mm growth diameter. Fifty-eight percent (58%) of the fungi survived at pH 2, 16% survived at 37 degrees C, while there was no survival at a temperature higher than 50 degrees C. All the fungi belonged to the Ascomycota phylum, classified under Dothideomycetes (46%), Eurotiomycetes (39%) and Sordariomycetes (11%). The predominant genera identified were Penicillium (35%), Alternaria (26%) and Cladosporium (17%). The findings revealed that medicinal plants, including Nigella sativa, are a source of untapped novel endophytic fungi, with abundant therapeutic and agricultural applications. (c) 2020 SAAB.

"Naturally, all plants harbor a diversity of endophytes and can produce a variety of compounds which positively affect the growth of their host plant. Endophytes can contribute in providing plant supplements, conflicting with pathogens, or directly influencing the growth and development of plants through synthesis of phytohormones. The present study aimed to explore the diversity of endophytic fungi from different parts of the three healthy halophytic plants i.e., Solanum surattense Burm. f., Chenopodium album L. and Zizyphus nummularia (Burm. f). As sa result, twenty-two endophytic fungi mostly belonging to ascomycetes were isolated from 92 samples with an overall colonization frequency of 23.02%. The endophytic fungi showed a relatively high percentage of colonization frequency (25%) in roots as compared to other parts. The isolated fungal strains were tested for salt tolerance and for their ability to produce plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Out of 12 different strains, five strains have salt tolerance potential and eight strains have shown to produce IAA in culture media. Further the isolated strains were also screened for their growth promoting activities such as 1-aminocyclopropane1-carboxylate deaminase, flavonoids, phenol, solubilize phosphate and to produce siderophores.","J","Ikram, M; Ali, N; Jan, G; Jan, FG; Pervez, R; Romman, M; Zainab, R; Yasmin, H; Khan, N",NA,"","","Ikram, Muhammad; Ali, Niaz; Jan, Gul; Jan, Farzana Gul; Pervez, Rainaz; Romman, Muhammad; Zainab, Rimsha; Yasmin, Humaira; Khan, Naeem",NA,NA,"Isolation of Endophytic Fungi from Halophytic Plants and their Identification and Screening for Auxin Production and Other Plant Growth Promoting Traits","JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Romman, Muhammad/AEE-1591-2022; Khan, Naeem/P-4791-2018; Yasmin, Humaira/ABB-1384-2021","Romman, Muhammad/0000-0002-1551-7235; Khan, Naeem/0000-0002-0379-4622; Yasmin, Humaira/0000-0002-4220-4808",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0721-7595","1435-8107","",NA,NA,"AUG",2023,42,"8",NA,"","SI",NA,"4707","4723","","10.1007/s00344-022-10685-3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-022-10685-3","","MAY 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000803812000001","View Full Record in Web of Science",143,"Presence"
"Background The experimental materials were a 60-year-old tea tree (Camellia sinensiscv. Shu Cha Zao; SCZ) (the mother plant) and 1-year-old and 20-year-old plants of SCZ that originated as mother plant cuttings. The aim of this study was to use high-throughput sequencing to study the spatial and dynamic distribution of endophytic fungi in different leaf niches (upper leaves, middle leaves, lower leaves) and rhizosphere soil on tea plants of different ages in the same garden. Results Ascomycota (83.77%), Basidiomycota (11.71%), and Zygomycota (3.45%) were the dominant fungal phyla in all samples.Cladosporium(12.73%),Zymoseptoria(9.18%), andStrelitziana(13.11%) were the dominant genera in the leaf. Alpha diversity analysis revealed that endophytic communities in leaves differed from those in rhizosphere soil and different leaf niches had similar fungal diversity. Shannon's indices and NMDS analysis indicated significant differences in fungal diversity and composition among the SCZ trees of different ages (p <= 0.01). The abundance ofCladosporiumandZymoseptoriadecreased with increasing SCZ age, whereas the abundance ofStrelitzianaincreased.

"Background To decipher the root and microbial interaction, secondary metabolite accumulation in roots and the microbial community's succession model during the plant's growth period demands an in-depth investigation. However, till now, no comprehensive study is available on the succession of endophytic fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) with roots of medicinal licorice plants and the effects of endophytic fungi and AMF on the secondary metabolite accumulation in licorice plant's root. Results In the current study, interaction between root and microbes in 1-3 years old medicinal licorice plant's root and rhizospheric soil was investigated. Secondary metabolites content in licorice root was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The composition and diversity of endophytic and AMF in the root and soil were deciphered using high-throughput sequencing technology. During the plant's growth period, as compared to AMF, time and species significantly affected the diversity and richness of endophytic fungi, such as Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Fusarium, Cladosporium, Sarocladium. The growth period also influenced the AMF diversity, evident by the significant increase in the relative abundance of Glomus and the significant decrease in the relative abundance of Diversispora. It indicated a different succession pattern between the endophytic fungal and AMF communities. Meanwhile, distance-based redundancy analysis and Mantel tests revealed root's water content and secondary metabolites (glycyrrhizic acid, liquiritin, and total flavonoids), which conferred endophytic fungi and AMF diversity. Additionally, plant growth significantly altered soil's physicochemical properties, which influenced the distribution of endophytic fungal and AMF communities. Conclusions This study indicated a different succession pattern between the endophytic fungal and AMF communities. During the plant's growth period, the contents of three secondary metabolites in roots increased per year, which contributed to the overall differences in composition and distribution of endophytic fungal and AMF communities. The endophytic fungal communities were more sensitive to secondary metabolites than AMF communities. The current study provides novel insights into the interaction between rhizospheric microbes and root exudates.","J","Dang, HL; Zhang, T; Wang, ZK; Li, GF; Zhao, WQ; Lv, XH; Zhuang, L",NA,"","","Dang, Hanli; Zhang, Tao; Wang, Zhongke; Li, Guifang; Zhao, Wenqin; Lv, Xinhua; Zhuang, Li",NA,NA,"Succession of endophytic fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi associated with the growth of plant and their correlation with secondary metabolites in the roots of plants","BMC PLANT BIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1471-2229","","",NA,NA,"APR 5",2021,21,"1",NA,"","",NA,"","","165","10.1186/s12870-021-02942-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-021-02942-6","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33820543,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000636942500001","View Full Record in Web of Science",146,"Presence"

The species composition is highly diversified with Simpson's diversity index reaching 0.959. Alternaria alternata is the dominant species accounting for 12.4% of the isolates. Twenty-four isolates exhibited antifungal activity against S. sclerotiorum in dual cultures on potato dextrose agar forming inhibition zones of 3-17 mm in width. The culture filtrates of Aspergillus flavipes CanS-34A, Chaetomium globosum CanS-73, Clonostachys rosea CanS-43 and Leptosphaeria biglobosa CanS-51 in potato dextrose broth exhibited consistent and effective suppression of oilseed rape leaf blight caused by S. sclerotiorum. Fusarium oxysporum CanR-46 was detected capable of production of volatile organic compounds highly inhibitory to S. sclerotiorum and B. cinerea. Moreover, A. alternata CanL-18, Fusarium tricinctum CanR-70 and CanR-71r, and L. biglobosa CanS-51 exhibited growth-promoting effects on oilseed rape. These results suggest that B. napus harbors diversified endophytic fungi, from which potential biocontrol agents against S. sclerotiorum and B. cinerea, and for promoting growth of B. napus can be screened.

"Background Taxol from Taxus species is a precious drug used for the treatment of cancer and can effectively inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. However, the growth of Taxus plants is very slow and the content of taxol is quite low. Therefore, it is of great significance to improve the yield of taxol by modern biotechnology without destroying the wild forest resources. Endophytic fungus which symbiosis with their host plants can promote the growth and secondary metabolism of medicinal plants. Results Here, an endophytic fungus KL27 was isolated from T. chinensis, and identified as Pseudodidymocyrtis lobariellae. The fermentation broth of KL27 (KL27-FB) could significantly promote the accumulation of taxol in needles of T. chinensis, reaching 0.361 +/- 0.082 mg/g center dot DW (dry weight) at 7 days after KL27-FB treatment, which is 3.26-fold increase as compared to the control. The RNA-seq and qRT-PCR showed that KL27-FB could significantly increase the expression of key genes involved in the upstream pathway of terpene synthesis (such as DXS and DXR) and those in the taxol biosynthesis pathway (such as GGPPS, TS, T5OH, TAT, T10OH, T14OH, T2OH, TBT, DBAT and PAM), especially at the early stage of the stimulation. Moreover, the activation of jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and JA signal transduction, and its crosstalk with other hormones, such as gibberellin acid (GA), ethylene (ET) and salicylic acid (SA), explained the elevation of most of the differential expressed genes related to taxol biosynthesis pathway. Moreover, TF (transcriptional factor)-encoding genes, including MYBs, ethylene-responsive transcription factors (ERFs) and basic/helix-loop-helix (bHLH), were detected as differential expressed genes after KL27-FB treatment, further suggested that the regulation of hormone signaling on genes of taxol biosynthesis was mediated by TFs. Conclusions Our results indicated that fermentation broth of endophytic fungus KL27-FB could effectively enhance the accumulation of taxol in T. chinensis needles by regulating the phytohormone metabolism and signal transduction and further up-regulating the expression of multiple key genes involved in taxol biosynthesis. This study provides new insight into the regulatory mechanism of how endophytic fungus promotes the production and accumulation of taxol in Taxus sp.","J","Cao, XY; Xu, LX; Wang, JY; Dong, MM; Xu, CY; Kai, GY; Wan, W; Jiang, JH",NA,"","","Cao, Xiaoying; Xu, Lingxia; Wang, Jingyi; Dong, Mengmeng; Xu, Chunyan; Kai, Guoyin; Wan, Wen; Jiang, Jihong",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungus Pseudodidymocyrtis lobariellae KL27 promotes taxol biosynthesis and accumulation in Taxus chinensis","BMC PLANT BIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kai, Guoyin/GWC-5827-2022; WANG, JINGYI/GSJ-1241-2022; wang, yi/HOF-6668-2023; wang, jiahui/IXD-1197-2023; Wang, Jing/IQW-3496-2023; wang, juan/IUO-6218-2023; wang, jing/HJA-5384-2022; wang, yue/ISA-4119-2023; Wang, Jin/GYA-2019-2022; wang, jie/HTQ-4920-2023; wang, jing/GVT-8700-2022; Wang, Jinguo/JED-9233-2023","Wang, Jing/0000-0002-8296-2961; Kai, Guoyin/0000-0001-5933-8178",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1471-2229","","",NA,NA,"JAN 3",2022,22,"1",NA,"","",NA,"","","12","10.1186/s12870-021-03396-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-021-03396-6","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34979929,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000738040100011","View Full Record in Web of Science",151,"Presence"
"This study assessed the diversity and distribution of endophytic fungal communities associated with the leaves and stems of four vascular plant species in the High Arctic using 454 pyrosequencing with fungal-specific primers targeting the ITS region. Endophytic fungal communities showed high diversity. The 76,691 sequences obtained belonged to 250 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Of these OTUs, 190 belonged to Ascomycota, 50 to Basidiomycota, 1 to Chytridiomycota, and 9 to unknown fungi. The dominant orders were Helotiales, Pleosporales, Capnodiales, and Tremellales, whereas the common known fungal genera were Cryptococcus, Rhizosphaera, Mycopappus, Melampsora, Tetracladium, Phaeosphaeria, Mrakia, Venturia, and Leptosphaeria.

"Endophytic fungi or endophytes exist widely inside the healthy tissues of living plants, and are important components of plant micro-ecosystems. Over the long period of evolution, some co-existing endophytes and their host plants have established a special relationship with one and another, which can significantly influence the formation of metabolic products in plants, then affect quality and quantity of crude drugs derived from medicinal plants. This paper will focus on the increasing knowledge of relationships between endophytic fungi and medicinal plants through reviewing of published research data obtained from the last 30 years. The analytical results indicate that the distribution and population structure of endophytes can be considerably affected by factors, such as the genetic background, age, and environmental conditions of their hosts. On the other hand, the endophytic fungi can also confer profound impacts on their host plants by enhancing their growth, increasing their fitness, strengthening their tolerances to abiotic and biotic stresses, and promoting their accumulation of secondary metabolites. All the changes are very important for the production of bioactive components in their hosts. Hence, it is essential to understand such relationships between endophytic fungi and their host medicinal plants. Such knowledge can be well exploited and applied for the production of better and more drugs from medicinal plants.","J","Jia, M; Chen, L; Xin, HL; Zheng, CJ; Rahman, K; Han, T; Qin, LP",NA,"","","Jia, Min; Chen, Ling; Xin, Hai-Liang; Zheng, Cheng-Jian; Rahman, Khalid; Han, Ting; Qin, Lu-Ping",NA,NA,"A Friendly Relationship between Endophytic Fungi and Medicinal Plants: A Systematic Review","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zheng, Chengjian/CAI-2262-2022; HAN, TINGTING/GQZ-8692-2022; Zheng, Chengjian/CAF-6160-2022","Zheng, Chengjian/0000-0002-7867-3438;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-302X","","",NA,NA,"JUN 9",2016,7,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","906","10.3389/fmicb.2016.00906","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2016.00906","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27375610,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000377362700001","View Full Record in Web of Science",153,"Review"

"Endophytic fungi residing in Panax quinquefolium (American ginseng) have not been well characterized. We collected American ginseng of one-, two-, three- and four-year-old plants cultivated in a forest reserve and identified the endophytic fungal isolates using traditional methods. The colonization frequency and the dominant endophytic fungal species were investigated. Endophytic fungal diversity indices and similarity coefficient were also assessed and all age groups of American ginseng studied were colonized by endophytic fungal assemblages; 134 fungal isolates were assigned to 27 taxa. The infection frequencies varied with the host age and tissue. The dominant endophytic fungi were recorded for each tissue and age of host. The roots of two- and four-year-old American ginseng exhibited the highest and the lowest Shannon-Wiener index respectively. Four-year-old American ginseng had a low similarity coefficient when compared with each of the other three ages classes.

"The emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus calls for inventive research and development strategies. Inhibition of this bacterial pathogenesis may be a promising therapeutic approach. The screening of antimicrobial compounds from endophytes is a promising way to meet the increasing threat of drug-resistant strains of human and plant pathogens. In the present study, a novel endophytic fungus, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, was isolated from the medicinal plant Vitex negundo L. Extracts of C. gloeosporioides were obtained using hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol solvents. The fungal extracts exhibited an effective antimicrobial activity against bacterial and fungal strains. The extracts were also analysed for antibacterial activity against methicillin-, penicillin- and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus strains (1-10). The methanol extract showed an effective antibacterial activity against S. aureus strain 9, with a minimal inhibitory concentration of 31.25 mu g mL-1. The synergistic action of endophytic fungal extract with antibiotics such as methicillin, penicillin and vancomycin was observed against S. aureus strain 6. The fractional inhibitory concentration index of methanol extract with methicillin, penicillin and vancomycin was 1.0, 0.5 and 0.375, respectively. These results clearly indicate that the metabolite of endophytic fungus C. gloeosporioides is a potential source of new antibiotics.","J","Arivudainambi, USE; Anand, TD; Shanmugaiah, V; Karunakaran, C; Rajendran, A",NA,"","","Arivudainambi, U.

"Endophytic fungi are those that live internally in apparently healthy and asymptomatic hosts. Endophytic fungi appear to be ubiquitous; indeed, no study has yet shown the existence of a plant species without endophytes. High species diversity is another characteristic of endophytic mycobiota which is depicted by the fact that it is quite common for endophyte surveys to find assemblages consisting of more than 30 fungal species per host plant species. Medicinal plants had been used to isolate and characterize directly the bioactive metabolites. However, the discovery of fungal endophytes inside these plants with capacity to produce the same compounds shifted the focus of new drug sources from plants to fungi. Bioactive natural products from endophytic fungi, isolated from different plant species, are attracting considerable attention from natural product chemists and biologists alike which is clearly depicted by the steady increase of publications devoted to this topic during the recent years. This review will highlight the chemical potential of endophytic fungi with focus on the detection of pharmaceutically valuable plant constituents as products of fungal biosynthesis. In addition, it will cover newly discovered endophytic fungi and also new bioactive metabolites reported in recent years from fungal endophytes. It summarizes the up-to-date and comprehensive information on bioactive compounds from endophytic fungi by having done a thorough survey of literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

"The endophytic fungal communities of Polygonum acuminatum and Aeschynomene fluminensis were examined with respect to soil mercury (Hg) contamination. Plants were collected in places with and without Hg+2 for isolation and identification of their endophytic root fungi. We evaluated frequency of colonization, number of isolates and richness, indices of diversity and similarity, functional traits (hydrolytic enzymes, siderophores, indoleacetic acid, antibiosis and metal tolerance) and growth promotion of Aeschynomene fluminensis inoculated with endophytic fungi on soil with mercury. The frequency of colonization, structure and community function, as well as the abundant distribution of taxa of endophytic fungi were influenced by mercury contamination, with higher endophytic fungi in hosts in soil with mercury. The presence or absence of mercury in the soil changes the profile of the functional characteristics of the endophytic fungal community. On the other hand, tolerance of lineages to multiple metals is not associated with contamination. A. fluminensis depends on its endophytic fungi, since plants free of endophytic fungi grew less than expected due to mercury toxicity. In contrast plants containing certain endophytic fungi showed good growth in soil containing mercury, even exceeding growth of plants cultivated in soil without mercury. The data obtained confirm the hypothesis that soil contamination by mercury alters community structure of root endophytic fungi in terms of composition, abundance and species richness. The inoculation of A. fluminensis with certain strains of stress tolerant endophytic fungi contribute to colonization and establishment of the host and may be used in processes that aim to improve phytoremediation of soils with toxic concentrations of mercury.","J","Pietro-Souza, W; Mello, IS; Vendruscullo, SJ; da Silva, GF; da Cunha, CN; White, JF; Soares, MA",NA,"","","Pietro-Souza, William; Mello, Ivani Souza; Vendruscullo, Suzana Junges; da Silva, Gilvan Ferreira; da Cunha, Catia Nunes; White, James Francis; Soares, Marcos Antonio",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungal communities of Polygonum acuminatum and Aeschynomene fluminensis are influenced by soil mercury contamination","PLOS ONE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Soares, Marcos Antonio/B-7683-2013; Soares, Marcos/Y-7844-2019","Soares, Marcos Antonio/0000-0002-8938-3188; Soares, Marcos/0000-0002-8938-3188; White, James/0000-0002-6780-7066; Pietro-Souza, William/0000-0002-8244-163X; Mello, Ivani/0000-0002-3355-0493; Vendruscolo, Suzana/0000-0002-2107-0046",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1932-6203","","",NA,NA,"JUL 25",2017,12,"7",NA,"","",NA,"","","e0182017","10.1371/journal.pone.0182017","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0182017","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28742846,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000406370000066","View Full Record in Web of Science",158,"Presence"

Endophytic fungi were isolated from roots, stems, and leaves of V.Vanda cristata and identified by both morphological and molecular study. Furthermore, the isolated endophytic fungi were subjected to auxin synthesis, phosphate solubilization, ammonia synthesis, and elicitor growth test for understanding their growth-promoting effect in a qualitative and quantitative manner. Altogether, 12 different endophytic fungi were isolated from roots, stems, and leaves of V. cristata of which most species belonged to Ascomycota. Unidentified II fungi were found to be most effective for auxin synthesis and phosphate solubilization while Agaricus bisporous and Mycolepto discus were most effective for ammonia synthesis. We have tested the plant growth-promoting activity of the twelve isolated endophytic fungi on Cymbidium aloifolium protocorms (12 weeks old). All the endophytic fungi showed growth-promoting activity. Plant growth of Cymbidium aloifolium was found higher on the MS medium supplemented with all fungal elicitors. Fungal elicitor CVS4, however, showed the highest plant growth-promoting activity toward C. aloifolium.","J","Chand, K; Shah, S; Sharma, J; Paudel, MR; Pant, B",NA,"","","Chand, Krishna; Shah, Sujit; Sharma, Jyotsna; Paudel, Mukti Ram; Pant, Bijaya",NA,NA,"Isolation, characterization, and plant growth-promoting activities of endophytic fungi from a wild orchid Vanda cristata","PLANT SIGNALING & BEHAVIOR","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Shah, Sujit/ACS-0932-2022","sharma, jyotsna/0000-0003-2691-7004; Shah, Sujit/0000-0002-6175-5242; Pant, Bijaya/0000-0001-5614-6031; Paudel, Mukti Ram/0000-0002-1739-9228",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1559-2316","1559-2324","",NA,NA,"MAY 3",2020,15,"5",NA,"","",NA,"","","e1744294","10.1080/15592324.2020.1744294","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15592324.2020.1744294","","MAR 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32208892,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000524695000001","View Full Record in Web of Science",160,"Presence"
"Brachypodium distachyon is a useful model organism for studying interaction of cereals with phytopathogenic fungi. The present study tested the possibility of a compatible interaction of B. distachyon with the endophytic fungus Microdochium bolleyi originated from wheat roots. There was evaluated the effect of this endophytic fungus on the intensity of the attack by pathogen Fusarium culmorum in B. distachyon and wheat, and also changes in expression of genes (in B. distachyon: BdChitinase1, BdPR1-5, BdLOX3, BdPAL, BdEIN3, and BdAOS; and in wheat: TaB2H2(chitinase), TaPR1.1, TaLOX, TaPAL, TaEIN2, and TaAOS) involved in defence against pathogens. Using light microscopy and newly developed specific primers was found to be root colonization of B. distachyon by the endophyte M. bolleyi. B. distachyon plants, as well as wheat inoculated with M. bolleyi showed significantly weaker symptoms on leaves from infection by fungus F. culmorum than did plants without the endophyte. Expression of genes BdPR1-5, BdChitinase1, and BdLOX3 in B. distachyon and of TaPR1.1 and TaB2H2 in wheat was upregulated after infection with F. culmorum. M. bolleyi-mediated resistance in B. distachyon was independent of the expression of the most tested genes. Taken together, the results of the present study show that B. distachyon can be used as a model host system for endophytic fungus M. bolleyi.","J","Matusinsky, P; Sedláková, B; Blesa, D",NA,"","","Matusinsky, Pavel; Sedlakova, Bozena; Blesa, Dominik",NA,NA,"Compatible interaction of Brachypodium distachyon and endophytic fungus Microdochium bolleyi","PLOS ONE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEDLÁKOVÁ, Božena/HJZ-3615-2023","Matusinsky, Pavel/0000-0002-9095-3934; Blesa, Dominik/0000-0003-1813-0981",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1932-6203","","",NA,NA,"",2022,17,"3",NA,"","",NA,"","","e0265357","10.1371/journal.pone.0265357","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265357","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35286339,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000799880200043","View Full Record in Web of Science",161,"Presence"

"Among several life-threatening diseases, vector-borne diseases play a significant role. Mosquito-borne conditions are dangerous and are more prevalent. Culex is the most prevalent and causative agent of many zoonotic diseases among various mosquito species. Endophytic fungi that reside in the healthy plant produce an array of bioactive compounds against several conditions causing pathogens. Thus, this study aimed to identify a novel antilarval combination from the endophytic fungi present in Leucas aspera leaves. The objectives include the isolation of endophytic fungi from leaf samples, selection of potent antilarval endophyte, and characterization of its bioactive compound. The exploration of the least studied fungi, Fusarium equiseti as an endophyte in the leaves of Leucas aspera with potent antilarval properties is an inquisitive discovery. A total of 10 endophytic fungi (EF-1 to EF-10) were isolated and screened for the larvicidal activity of the fungal broth and its spore. The best isolate, EF-2 was identified as Fusarium equiseti. The crude sample and the active fraction of the ethyl acetate extract exhibited potent antilarval properties against Culex mosquito larvae with 90% mortality. Phytochemical analysis and characterization studies by UV-Vis spectroscopy and GC-MS revealed bioactive compounds in the active fraction of the extract. Overall, this study suggested a new option for biocide formulation that could aid in the effort to control mosquitoes. Among several discoveries of bioactive compounds from the plant extracts, this study has identified novel compounds from its endophytic fungi rather than the plant itself. The extracts of endophytic fungi Fusarium equiseti isolated from Leucas aspera, has antilarvicidal activity.","J","Kavitha, K; Aarthi, P; Prakash, M",NA,"","","Kavitha, Kuppuswamy; Aarthi, Paneerselvam; Prakash, Mani",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungi Fusarium Equiseti EF2 Isolated from Leucas Aspera: A Novel Biocontrol Agent Against Culex Sp","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCE AND PHARMA RESEARCH","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2250-0480","","",NA,NA,"NOV",2022,12,"6",NA,"","",NA,"L107","L117","","10.22376/ijpbs/lpr.2022.12.6.L107-117","http://dx.doi.org/10.22376/ijpbs/lpr.2022.12.6.L107-117","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000886531700013","View Full Record in Web of Science",163,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi have the ability to live inside the host plant tissues without causing neither symptoms of diseases/or harm. Opportunistic infections are accountable for majority of the outbreaks, thereby putting a burden on the health system. To investigate and characterize the bioactive compounds for the control of bacteria of clinical importance, extracts from endophytic fungi were isolated from indigenous South African medicinal plants. Extracts from endophytic fungi were isolated from 133 fungal strains and screened against Gram positive and negative bacteria namely Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, and E. gallinarum using disk diffusion. Furthermore, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed to identify the bioactive compounds. Sixteen out of one hundred and thirty-three (12%) fungi extracts exhibited antibacterial properties against some of the selected bacteria. E. coli was found to be the most susceptible in contrast to E. faecium and E. gallinarum which were the most resistant. The isolate MHE 68, identified as Alternaria sp. displayed the greater spectrum of antibacterial activities by controlling selected clinical bacteria strains including resistant E. faecium and E. gallinarum. The chemical analysis of the extract from MHE 68 indicated that linoleic acid (9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Z,Z)) and cyclodecasiloxane could be accountable for the antibacterial activity. This is the first study conducted on the secondary metabolites produced by endophytic fungal strains isolated from the Pelargonium sidoides DC. possessing antibacterial properties.","J","Manganyi, MC; Tchatchouang, CDK; Regnier, T; Bezuidenhout, CC; Ateba, CN",NA,"","","Manganyi, Madira Coutlyne; Tchatchouang, Christ-Donald K.; Regnier, Thierry; Bezuidenhout, Cornelius Carlos; Ateba, Collins Njie",NA,NA,"Bioactive Compound Produced by Endophytic Fungi Isolated From Pelargonium sidoides Against Selected Bacteria of Clinical Importance","MYCOBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"MANGANYI, MADIRA COUTLYNE/AAE-3590-2022; Bezuidenhout, Cornelius C/D-3179-2011","MANGANYI, MADIRA COUTLYNE/0000-0002-0209-5547; Bezuidenhout, Cornelius C/0000-0002-6047-4991",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1229-8093","2092-9323","",NA,NA,"JUL 3",2019,47,"3",NA,"","",NA,"335","339","","10.1080/12298093.2019.1631121","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/12298093.2019.1631121","","JUL 2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31565469,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000475029500001","View Full Record in Web of Science",164,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi live inside vegetal tissues without causing damage to the host plant and may provide lead compounds for drug discovery. The co-culture of two or more endophytic fungi can trigger silent gene clusters, which could lead to the isolation of bioactive compounds. In this study, two endophytic strains isolated from Handroanthus impetiginosus leaves, identified as Talaromyces purpurogenus H4 and Phanerochaete sp. H2, were grown in mixed and axenic cultures. The meroterpenoid austin was detected only in the extracts from the mixed culture. Once isolated, austin displayed very interesting trypanocidal activity, with an IC50 value of 36.6 +/- 1.2 mu g/mL against Trypanosoma cruzi in the epimastigote form.

"Endophytic fungi are effective in plant growth and development by secreting various kinds of plant hormones and nutrients. However, the cellular and molecular interactions between the endophytic fungi and plant growth-promoting have remained less explored. The present study was designed to explore the effects of the infection and colonization events of Chaetomium globosum strain ND35 on cucumber growth and the expression pattern of some metabolically important genes in development of the cucumber radicle. The results demonstrated that strain ND35 can infect and colonize the outer layers (cortical cells) of cucumber root and form a symbiotic structure with the host cell, similar to a periarbuscular membrane and establish chemical communication with the plant. Through transcriptome analysis, we found the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) caused by strain ND35 were mainly enriched in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, plant hormone signal transduction, plant-pathogen interaction and photosynthesis. Correspondingly, the contents of reactive oxygen species (ROS), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), gibberellin (GA), zeatin (ZT), salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and the activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), 4-coumarate-CoA ligase (4CL), cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD), and peroxidase (POD) in ND35-colonized seedlings were generally higher than those of non-inoculated seedlings. Overall, the infection and colonization events of C. globosum strain ND35 increased cucumber growth through complex regulation of plant hormones biosynthesis and metabolism. Furthermore, although the endophytic fungus strain ND35 produced IAA, GA, ZT, and ergosterol in the fermentation broth, and there are enabled to promote growth of cucumber, it is uncertain whether there are ND35-derived microbial hormones in plants. This study of the interaction between cucumber and strain ND35 contributes to a better understanding of the plant-endophytic fungi interactions, and may help to develop new strategies for crop production.","J","Tian, YH; Fu, XS; Zhang, GC; Zhang, R; Kang, ZS; Gao, KX; Mendgen, K",NA,"","","Tian, Yehan; Fu, Xuesong; Zhang, Gongchen; Zhang, Rui; Kang, Zhensheng; Gao, Kexiang; Mendgen, Kurt",NA,NA,"Mechanisms in Growth-Promoting of Cucumber by the Endophytic Fungus Chaetomium globosum Strain ND35","JOURNAL OF FUNGI","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Gao, Kexiang/0000-0001-5592-3986; Kang, Zhensheng/0000-0001-5575-0122",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2309-608X","",NA,NA,"FEB",2022,8,"2",NA,"","",NA,"","","180","10.3390/jof8020180","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof8020180","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35205933,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000769712400001","View Full Record in Web of Science",166,"Presence"
"A study was designed to isolate potentially pathogenic, endophytic fungi of red alder (Alnus rubra). Apparently healthy leaves and 2- to 3-year-old twigs were collected at three and eight sites, respectively, surface sterilized, cut into small pieces, and incubated on 2% malt extract agar. Ninety percent of the leaves and more than 80% of the twigs were colonized by endophytic fungi; 40 different fungi were isolated and identified. Fungi previously recorded as plant pathogens dominated the endophyte community of leaves (Gnomonia setacea, Gnomoniella tubaeformis, and Septoria alni) but were only minor components of the fungal population of twigs (Melanconis alni and a Nectria species). Abundance of each fungus species and the species composition depended on the plant organ sampled and collection site. In twigs, three main types of endophyte associations occurred among sites: the first was dominated by the unidentified Black Mycelium 2, the second by Phomopsis sp. 2, and the third by Ophiovalsa suffusa, Pezicula livida, and Phloeosporella sp.

"The objective of this study was to evaluate the diversity of endophytic fungi of different parts of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort (CX) and further characterize their biological activities and identify chemical compounds produced by these endophytic fungi. A total of 21 endophytic fungi were isolated and identified from CX. Penicillium oxalicum, Simplicillium sp., and Colletotrichum sp. were identified as promising strains by the color reaction. Comparing different organic extracts of the three strains, it was observed that the ethyl acetate extract of Penicillium oxalicum and Simplicillium sp. and the n-butanol extract of Colletotrichum sp. showed significant antioxidant and antibacterial activities. The ethyl acetate extracts of Penicillium oxalicum had outstanding antioxidant and antibacterial effects, and its radical scavenging rates for ABTS and DPPH were 98.43 +/- 0.006% and 90.11 +/- 0.032%, respectively. At the same time, their IC50 values were only 0.18 +/- 0.02 mg/mL and 0.04 +/- 0.003 mg/mL. The ethyl acetate extract of Penicillium oxalicum showed MIC value of only 0.5 mg/mL against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. By liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we found that Penicillium oxalicum could produce many high-value polyphenols, such as hesperidin (36.06 mu mol/g), ferulic acid (1.17 mu mol/g), and alternariol (12.64 mu mol/g), which can be a potential resource for the pharmaceutical industry.

"Over the past 20 years, the biodiversity associated with shaded coffee plantations and the role of diverse agroforestry types in biodiversity conservation and environmental services have been topics of debate. Endophytic fungi, which are microorganisms that inhabit plant tissues in an asymptomatic manner, form a part of the biodiversity associated with coffee plants. Studies on the endophytic fungi communities of cultivable host plants have shown variability among farming regions; however, the variability in fungal endophytic communities of coffee plants among different coffee agroforestry systems is still poorly understood. As such, we analyzed the diversity and communities of foliar endophytic fungi inhabiting Coffea arabica plants growing in the rustic plantations and simple polycultures of two regions in the center of Veracruz, Mexico. The endophytic fungi isolates were identified by their morphological traits, and the majority of identified species correspond to species of fungi previously reported as endophytes of coffee leaves. We analyzed and compared the colonization rates, diversity, and communities of endophytes found in the different agroforestry systems and in the different regions. Although the endophytic diversity was not fully recovered, we found differences in the abundance and diversity of endophytes among the coffee regions and differences in richness between the two different agroforestry systems of each region. No consistent pattern of community similarity was found between the coffee agroforestry systems, but we found that rustic plantations shared the highest number of morphospecies. The results suggest that endophyte abundance, richness, diversity, and communities may be influenced predominantly by coffee region, and to a lesser extent, by the agroforestry system. Our results contribute to the knowledge of the relationships between agroforestry systems and biodiversity conservation and provide information regarding some endophytic fungi and their communities as potential management tools against coffee plant pests and pathogens.","J","Saucedo-García, A; Anaya, AL; Espinosa-García, FJ; González, MC",NA,"","","Saucedo-Garcia, Aurora; Luisa Anaya, Ana; Espinosa-Garcia, Francisco J.; Gonzalez, Maria C.",NA,NA,"Diversity and Communities of Foliar Endophytic Fungi from Different Agroecosystems of Coffea arabica L. in Two Regions of Veracruz, Mexico","PLOS ONE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Espinosa-Garcia, Francisco J/A-4954-2008; Espinosa-García, F.

"The effects of high vs. low levels of endophytic fungi on the phenotypic plasticity of cloned genotypes were examined in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The objectives were to determine whether endophytic fungi influence plastic responses of host genotypes to variable soil nutrients and whether or not endophyte infection and host genotype interact to determine the extent of this plasticity. Twelve infected genotypes were cloned into ramets: half the ramets were treated with the systemic fungicide Benomyl to reduce or eliminate the endophyte, while the other half were untreated. Ramets of each genotype were subjected to high, medium, or low levels of nutrients in the greenhouse for 11 wk. Tiller number, leaf area, and leaf mass were determined after 11 and 25 wk. The fungicide significantly reduced the level of endophyte infection. Responses to nutrient conditions in relation to fungicide treatment were genotype specific: for some genotypes, high levels of endophytic fungi appeared to reduce plasticity, while for other genotypes the endophyte had no effect. The potential for microscopic symbionts to affect phenotypic plasticity in genetically variable populations has not often been recognized. However, the clandestine effects of symbionts on the plasticity of host genotypes could impact microevolutionary processes occurring within plant populations that occupy heterogeneous environments.","J","Cheplick, GP",NA,"","","Cheplick, GP",NA,NA,"Effects of endophytic fungi on the phenotypic plasticity of Lolium perenne (Poaceae)","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0002-9122","1537-2197","",NA,NA,"JAN",1997,84,"1",NA,"","",NA,"34","40","","10.2307/2445880","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2445880","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1997WD68200004","View Full Record in Web of Science",170,"Presence"

"Endophytic fungi of medicinal plants are abundant, and their metabolites often have antioxidant, antibacterial, and antitumor effects and can produce secondary metabolites identical or similar to those of their hosts, which can mitigate the problem of insufficient supply of medicinal plants. In this study, we screened endophytic fungi for strains that produce the same diterpene lactones as Andrographis paniculata based on their biological activity. Firstly, the dominant group of endophytic fungi of Andrographis paniculata was screened and pathogenicity was studied using Koch's rule. Secondly, DPPH, ABTS, OH, PTIO radical scavenging, and FRAP assays were used to detect the antioxidant activity of the extracellular extracts of the strains, and total phenol and total flavonoid contents of the strains with high antioxidant capacity were determined. S. aureus, B. subtilis, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa were used to determine the antibacterial activity of the mycelial extracts of the strains. Finally, the secondary metabolites of the mycelial extracts of the strains were examined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that 32 strains of Andrographis paniculata were relatively isolated > 70% and non-pathogenic. Extracellular extracts of strains AP-1 and AP-4 showed vigorous antioxidant activity, and AP-4, AP-12, AP-47, and AP-48 showed antibacterial activity against four strains of bacteria. The HPLC results indicated that the mycelial extracts of AP-4 and AP-12 contained diterpene lactones. The two endophytic fungi were recognized as Colletotrichum sp. The study successfully obtained diterpene lactones from the endophytic fungus of Andrographis paniculata and confirmed the feasibility of using endophytic fungal strains to produce active substances consistent with the host. It was also useful for exploring endophytic fungi and medicinal plants. The relationship provides theoretical guidance.","J","Li, N; Xu, D; Huang, RH; Zheng, JY; Liu, YY; Hu, BS; Gu, YQ; Du, Q",NA,"","","Li, Na; Xu, Dan; Huang, Rui-Hua; Zheng, Jian-Yun; Liu, You-Yan; Hu, Bin-Sheng; Gu, Yuan-Qin; Du, Qin",NA,NA,"A New Source of Diterpene Lactones From Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.)

"The role of endophytic fungi in plant growth and development is well documented. However, endophytic fungi with growth promotion capacity have never been isolated from weeds previously. In the current study, we isolated 8 fungal endophytes from the roots of Monochoria vaginalis, a serious weed of rice paddy in Korea. These isolates were screened on Waito-C, in order to identify plant growth promoting metabolites. Two fungal isolates (M5.A & M1.5) significantly promoted the plant height and shoot length of Waito-C during preliminary screening experiments. The culture filtrates (CFs) of M5.A and M1.5 also promoted the shoot length of Echinocloa crusgalli. Gibberellins (GAs) analysis of the CFs of M5.A and M1.5 showed that these endophytic fungi secrete higher quantities of GAs as compared with wild-type G. fujikuroi KCCM12329. The CF of M5.A contained bioactive GAs (GA(3), 2.8 ng/ml; GA(4), 2.6 ng/ml, and GA(7), 6.68 ng/ml) in conjunction with physiologically inactive GA(9) (1.61 ng/ml) and GA(24) (0.18 ng/ml). The CF of M1.5 contained physiologically active GAs (GA(3), 1.64 ng/ml; GA(4), 1.37 ng/ml and GA(7), 6.29 ng/ml) in conjunction with physiologically inactive GA(9) (3.44 ng/ml), GA(12) (0.3 ng/ml), and GA(24) (0.59 ng/ml).

"Aims Loranthus tanakae Franch. & Sav is a medicinal plant that has a variety of pharmacological properties. However, its study is currently limited because of its relative shortage of natural abundance. The objective of this work was to find an alternative resource from this plant that could produce its bioactive ingredients. Methods and Results We isolated endophytic fungi from the twigs of Loranthus tanakae Franch. & Sav and eight flavonoid-producing endophytic fungi were selected. The eight endophytic fungi meeting the criteria were identified as Alternaria tenuissima, Dothiorella gregaria, Penicillium aethiopicum, Nothophoma quercina and Hypoxylon perforatum by morphological and molecular methods. The antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the flavonoid-producing endophytic fungi were investigated in vitro, where Alternaria tenuissima ZP28 and ZM148 demonstrated greater activities than the other six strains. Flavonoids of ZP28 and ZM148 were preliminarily identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Conclusion After screening the flavonoid-producing endophytic fungi, Alternaria tenuissima ZP28 and ZM148 were found to have good antioxidant and antibacterial activities. Overall, this study provided new direction and resources for the acquisition of flavonoids.

"of Medicinal plants have been known to act as a harbor for endophytic fungi, owing to their being able to produce bioactive compounds similar to those of their host. Thymus is a member of the Lamiaceae family. It enjoys a long history of traditional and modern medicine as a disinfectant that possesses antimicrobial properties. The pharmaceutical properties of this plant can be attributed to its endophytes. In this research, 89 endophytic fungi of Thymus spp. were tested and examined to investigate their biocontrol effects against the plant pathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea, the plant pathogenic bacteria Xanthomonas arboricola pv. juglandis and Streptomyces scabies and human pathogens Escherichia coli ATTCC 25922 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 33591. Thereafter, to control fungal and bacterial pathogens, the extracellular metabolites of the endophytic fungi were extracted and used in seven different concentrations. The effect of endophytic fungi on the growth of B. cinerea suggested that the M24 isolate (Fusarium subglutinans) was the one with the greatest percentage of inhibition. Out of the 89 isolates tested against bacteria, only one isolate affected X. arboricola, three of them affected E. coli, and eight isolates showed biocontrol effect on bacterium S. aureus. In the case of S. scabies, all Fusarium isolates prevented its growth. Among other isolates, only M32 and M33, which belong to mycelia sterilia, affected the growth of this bacterium. Endophytic extracellular metabolites had great potential to control plant pathogens as well.","J","Mirzaei, S; Masumi, S",NA,"","","Mirzaei, Soheila; Masumi, Sahar",NA,NA,"The Antimicrobial Activity of Endophytic Fungi Isolated from Thymus spp.","JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL PLANTS AND BY-PRODUCTS-JMPB","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2322-1399","2588-3739","",NA,NA,"APR",2023,12,"1",NA,"","",NA,"117","124","","10.22092/jmpb.2022.342405.1192","http://dx.doi.org/10.22092/jmpb.2022.342405.1192","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001035274000012","View Full Record in Web of Science",175,"Presence"
"Background Fungal endophytes produce many secondary metabolites that can reduce root rot diseases. Soybean is a particularly important crop worldwide. Endophytic fungi can be isolated, identified, and incorporated into sustainable agriculture for the biological control of many diseases. Results The aim of this study was to isolate some endophytic fungi for controlling the most important diseases of soybean plants and to study the mechanisms underlying this biocontrol regarding the suppression of pathogens. Ten endophytic fungi were isolated from soybean plants. Among them, the 3 fungi isolates that exhibited a high percentage of antagonistic activity against Rhizoctonia solani, the causal pathogen of root rot disease of soybean plants, were identified as Trichoderma longibrachiatum S12, T. asperellum S11, and T. atroviride PHYTAT7. The 3 fungi isolates had the ability to produce pectinase and chitinase and to solubilize phosphors. Moreover, they produced siderophores and indole acetic acid (IAA), which have a strong effect on the growth of the plants. The 3 isolates reduced disease severity by 64, 60, and 55%, respectively than the infected control. Conclusion The results suggest that certain endophytic fungi associated with soybean plants have potential for the management of root rot diseases in soybean. Moreover, these isolates can be considered as having a growth-promoting effect in soybean plants.","J","Sallam, N; Ali, EF; Seleim, MAA; Bagy, HMMK",NA,"","","Sallam, Nashwa; Ali, Esmat F.; Seleim, Mohamed A.

"Acacia mangium is an important wood for commercial products especially pulp and medium-density fibreboard. However, it is susceptible to Ceratocystis fimbriata infection, leading to Ceratocystis wilt. Therefore, the present work aimed to (i) establish the diversity of endophytic fungi in different plant parts of A. mangium,and (ii) evaluate the antifungal potentials of the isolated and identified endophytic fungi against C. fimbriata. Endophytic fungal identification was conducted by PCR amplification and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and ITS4 regions of nuclear ribosomal DNA. A total of 66 endophytic fungi were successfully isolated from different parts of A. mangium; leaf (21), stem (13), petiole (12), root (9), flower (6), and fruit (5). The endophytic fungal isolates belonged to Ascomycota (95.5%) and Zygomycota (4.5%). For Ascomycota 13 genera were identified: Trichoderma (28.6%), Nigrospora (28.6%), Pestalotiopsis (12.7%), Lasiodiplodia (9.5%), Aspergillus (6.3%), Sordariomycetes (3%), and Neopestalotiopsis, Pseudopestalotiopsis, Eutiarosporella, Curvularia, Fusarium, Penicillium, and Hypoxylon each with a single isolate. For Zygomycota, only Blakeslea sp. (5%) was isolated. Against C. fimbriata, Trichoderma koningiopsis (AC 1S) from stem, Nigrospora oryzae (AC 7L) from leaf, Nigrospora sphaerica (AC 3F) from the flower, Lasiodiplodia sp. (AC 2 U) from fruit, Nigrospora sphaerica (AC 4P) from petiole, and Trichoderma sp. (AC 9R) from root exhibited strong inhibition for C. fimbriata between 58.33 to 69.23%. Thus, it can be concluded that certain endophytic fungi of A. mangium have the potential to be harnessed as anti-Ceratocystis agent in future biotechnological applications.","J","Ahmad, MF; Zahari, R; Mohtar, M; Wan-Muhammad-Azrul, WA; Hishamuddin, MS; Samsudin, NIP; Hassan, A; Terhem, R",NA,"","","Ahmad, Mohd Farid; Zahari, Rozihawati; Mohtar, Mastura; Wan-Muhammad-Azrul, Wan Azhar; Hishamuddin, Muhammad Syahmi; Samsudin, Nik Iskandar Putra; Hassan, Affendy; Terhem, Razak",NA,NA,"Diversity of endophytic fungi isolated from different plant parts of Acacia mangium, and antagonistic activity against Ceratocystis fimbriata, a causal agent of Ceratocystis wilt disease of A. mangium in Malaysia","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1664-302X","",NA,NA,"NOV 8",2022,13,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","887880","10.3389/fmicb.2022.887880","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.887880","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36425026,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000889778900001","View Full Record in Web of Science",177,"Presence"
"This study investigated the diversity and host component-transforming activity of endophytic fungi in medicinal plant Kadsura angustifolia. A total of 426 isolates obtained were grouped into 42 taxa belonging to Fungi Imperfecti (65.96%), Ascomycota (27.00%), Zygomycota (1.64%), Basidiomycota (0.47%) and Mycelia Sterilia (4.93%). The abundance, richness, and species composition of endophytic assemblages were significantly dependent on the tissue and the sampling site. Many phytopathogenic species associated with healthy K angustifolia were found prevalent. Among them, Verticillium dahliae was dominant with 16.43% abundance. From 134 morphospecies selected, 39 showed remarkable biocatalytic activity and were further identified as species belonging to the genera Colletotrichum, Eupenicillium, Fusarium, Hypoxylon, Penicillium, Phomopsis, Trametes, Trichoderma, Umbelopsis, Verticillium and Xylaria on the basis of the sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2). The results obtained in this work show that K angustifolia is an interesting reservoir of pathogenic fungal species, and could be a community model for further ecological and evolutionary studies.

"Endophytic fungi are ubiquitously distributed in orchids and have a great impact on the host plant. The diversity of endophytic fungi in the medicinal orchid Dendrobium loddigesii Rolfe was investigated and their bioactivities in microbe and plant growth were explored here. Endophytic fungi were identified by using morphological and molecular biological methods. Antimicrobial activity was determined by a standard disk assay. Activity in promoting plant growth was confirmed by root inoculation of endophytic fungi in seedling tray and pot experiments. Overall, 48 isolates were isolated from D. loddigesii and identified to belong to 18 genera, with Fusarium and Acremonium being the most dominant populations. A total of 17 isolates belonging to 9 genera were screened for their antimicrobial activity, and Fusarium spp., 8 of the 17 isolates, was also the dominant population. In the seedling tray experiment, two isolates, one of Fusarium named DL26 and the other of Pyrenochaeta named DL351, were shown to enhance plant growth in alder bark-humus medium, and the latter displayed weak activity against Bacillus subtilis (As 1.308) and Aspergillus fumigatus (As 3.2910). In the pot experiment, after inoculation of DL26 and DL351, five out of seven media were fit for plant-endophyte symbionts. Medium #1 of red brick fragments and sphagna was optimal in accelerating plant growth. In conclusion, a great diversity of endophytic fungi in D. loddigesii was first confirmed in a considerable proportion of antimicrobial isolates.

"Today when the quest of new lead molecules to supply the development pipeline is driving the course of drug discovery, endophytic fungi with their outstanding biosynthetic potential seem to be highly promising avenues for natural product scientists. However, challenges such as the production of inadequate quantities of compounds, the attenuation or loss of ability of endophytes to produce the compound of interest when grown in culture and the inability of fungal endophytes to express their full biosynthetic potential in laboratory conditions have been the major constraints. These have led to the application of small chemical elicitors that induce epigenetic changes in fungi to activate their silent gene clusters optimizing the amount of metabolites of interest or inducing the synthesis of hitherto undescribed compounds. In this respect small molecular weight compounds which are known to function as inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC), DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and proteasome have proven their efficacy in enhancing or inducing the production of specialized metabolites by fungi. Moreover, organic solvents, metals and plants extracts are also acknowledged for their ability to cause shifts in fungal metabolism. We highlight the successful studies from the past two decades reporting the ability of structurally diverse small molecular weight compounds to elicit the production of previously undescribed metabolites from endophytic fungi grown in culture. This mini review argues in favor of chemical elicitation as an effective strategy to optimize the production of fungal metabolites and invigorate the pipeline of drug discovery with new chemical entities.","J","Toghueo, RMK; Sahal, D; Boyom, FF",NA,"","","Toghueo, Rufin Marie Kouipou; Sahal, Dinkar; Boyom, Fabrice Fekam",NA,NA,"Recent advances in inducing endophytic fungal specialized metabolites using small molecule elicitors including epigenetic modifiers","PHYTOCHEMISTRY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Toghueo, Rufin/ABA-3152-2021; SAHAL, DINKAR/GYD-7570-2022","Toghueo, Rufin/0000-0003-2144-0710;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0031-9422","","",NA,NA,"JUN",2020,174,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","112338","10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.112338","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2020.112338","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32179305,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000529798600030","View Full Record in Web of Science",181,"Review"
"Dendrobium are tropical orchid plants that host diverse endophytic fungi. The role of these fungi is not currently well understood in Dendrobium plants. We morphologically and molecularly identified these fungal endophytes, and created an efficient system for evaluating the pathogenicity and symptoms of endophytic fungi on Dendrobium nobile and Dendrobium officinale though in vitro co-culturing. ReThe colony morphological traits of Dendrobium myco-endophytes (DMEs) were recorded for their identification. Molecular identification revealed the presence of Colletotrichum tropicicola, Fusarium keratoplasticum, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, and Trichoderma longibrachiatum. The pathogenicity results revealed that T. longibrachiatum produced the least pathogenic effects against D. nobile protocorms. In seedlings, T. longibrachiatum showed the least pathogenic effects against D. officinale seedlings after seven days.

"Nature's degradation and environmental concerns have triggered the enormous interest among the researchers to pursue a sustainable solution for environmental monitoring. Combining biotechnology and analytical techniques encourage developing advanced biosensors to significantly improve the environmental monitoring at a lower cost. Herein, we made an effort to shed some light on endophytic fungi in biosensing applications based on optical and electrochemical detection signal mechanisms. Biosensors are hybrid devices that can generate specific qualitative or quantitative sensing signal about target analyte concentration (such as heavy metal or chemical toxicant in a sample) by integrating biological or biomimetic detection element with the physical/chemical transducer. There are only a few studies reported for the endophytes application in biosensor, which we have summarized in the current perspective. Concisely, endophytes are rich sources of metabolites that can be utilized for the biogenic synthesis of nanoparticles which can be further incorporated in sensing devices. In addition, the enzymatic extracts of endophytic fungi can be directly applied as bio-receptors upon immobilization. The studies on the endophytic fungi based sensing element indicates its potential use for efficient monitoring and treatment of emerging contaminants in the environment. (c) 2020 SAAB.

"Amylases are among the most important enzymes used in modern biotechnology particularly in the process involving starch hydrolysis. Fungal amylase has large applications in food and pharmaceutical industries. Considering these facts, endophytic fungi isolated from the plant Alpinia calcarata (Haw.) Roscoe were screened for amylolytic activity on glucose yeast extract peptone agar (GYP) medium. Among thirty isolates of endophytic fungi, isolate number seven identified as Cylindrocephalum sp. (Ac-7) showed highest amylolytic activity and was taken for further study. Influence of various physical and chemical factors such as pH, temperature, carbon and nitrogen sources on amylase production in liquid media were studied. The maximal amylase production was found to be at 30 degrees C and at pH 7.0 of the growth medium. Among the various carbon and nitrogen sources tested, maltose at 1.5% and Sodium nitrate at 0.3% respectively gave optimum amylase production.","J","Sunitha, VH; Ramesha, A; Savitha, J; Srinivas, C",NA,"","","Sunitha, V.

"Endophytic fungi live inside plants as symbionts for at least one period of their life cycle. They play an important role in plant defence and could be promising sources of valuable natural bioactive products. The present study aimed to select endophytic fungi antagonistic to Microcyclus ulei, the agent of South American Leaf Blight (SALB) responsible for the weak development of rubber plantations in Latin America. Endophytic fungi were isolated from leaves of three cultivars (FX3864, CDC312, MDF180) of Hevea brasiliensis (the rubber tree) with distinct resistance levels to the attack by Microcyclus ulei. Leaf samples were collected from a 5,000 ha area of the Michelin plantations (Igrapiuna, Bahia, Brazil). A total of 435 colonies of endophytic fungi were isolated, purified, and preserved in sterilized distilled water. Lyophilized culture filtrates obtained from 88 fungal isolates, grown in liquid malt extract medium, were tested in vitro at concentrations of 50% and 12.5% for their inhibitory potential against the germination of M. ulei PMB26 conidia. Thirteen filtered cultures of endophytic fungi that presented inhibitory activity above 80% (at the concentration 12.5%) were characterized taxonomically by sequencing the ITS regions of rDNA, revealing the following taxa: Fusarium sp., Gibberella sp., Glomerella cingulata, Microsphaeropsis sp., Myrothecium sp., Pestalotiopsis sp. and Phomopsis sp. Three taxa were detected only in the resistant cultivars: Microsphaeropsis sp., and Pestalotiopsis sp. in MDF180, and Myrothecium sp. in CDC312. The present work constitutes the first study showing inhibitory activity of rubber tree endophytic fungi on Microcyclus ulei. These results provide an encouraging basis for the identification of new bioactive molecules for an effective control of South American leaf blight.","J","Rocha, ACS; Garcia, D; Uetanabaro, APT; Carneiro, RTO; Araujo, IS; Mattos, CRR; Góes-Neto, A",NA,"","","Rocha, Anderson C.

"Objectives: Endophytic fungi are widely known to reside in plant tissues causing no harm to host plants or even no noticeable change. They may colonize host plants for a part of their life cycle or may complete the entire life cycle since host provide a variety of novel metabolites. Despite being in a close relationship with medicinal host plants, the diversity and metabolic spectrum of endophytic fungi have not been researched well. Their diversity and ecological niche as plant symbionts make them attractive targets in the search for novel biochemicals.Methods: We aimed to isolate, purify, and characterize the endophytic fungal population of medicinal host plants cultivated in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The goal was achieved through morphological identifica-tion and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions in rRNA analyses to determine phylogeny and diversity. Three aromatic and medicinal plants Jasminum sambac, Camellia sinensis, and Ocimum basilicum collected from the Riyadh region, Saudi Arabia were investigated. In total, 84 isolates were purified and they were grouped into 20 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) as per their sequences of ITS regions in rRNA. Results: Twenty species of endophytic fungi were grouped in 12 genera i.e. Neopestalotiopsis, Trichoderma, Fusarium, Colletotrichum, Myrothecium, Chaetomium, Alternaria, Phoma, Curvularia, Cladosporium, Neodidymelliopsis, and Aspergillus and all isolates belonged to Ascomycota phylum. J. sambac was found dominant among other and had a relative frequency of 27%. C. sinensis was next with 18.7% relative fre-quency. The diversity was prominently recorded in leaf organs over stem and roots while roots exhibited the lowest diversity. Isolates also produced indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase enzyme, and siderophores with variable magnitudes that could be assigned to their wide range of metabolic variations from species to species. Conclusion: Conclusively, J. sambac, C. sinensis, and O. basilicum are a good source of endophytic fungi with certain plant growth-promoting traits. Overall, Alternaria was found as the most predominant genus in terms of colonization rate. Further deternminations are required to screen the beneficial compounds released by these endophytic fungi.

"Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) is one of the most important economic crops in China; however, black shank caused by Phytophthora parasitica is major threat to its cultivation. So far, little is known regarding potential antagonistic effects of endophytes on plant pathogens. A total of 109 culturable endophytic fungal strains were recovered from various tissues of six tobacco cultivars that are commonly cultivated in southwestern China. Morphological and molecular identification showed that these isolates belonged to 18 different genera, including Aspergillus, Chaetomium, Gibellulopsis and Penicillium as predominant genera, which were frequently observed in stem, leaf and root tissues. Among them, only 17 endophytic fungal strains exerted antagonistic effects on P. parasitica in the dual-culture test, and the highest inhibition rate of 73% was produced by a Penicillium janthinellum strain isolated from stem tissue of a cultivar HD. Nevertheless, a field trial revealed that Shannon-Wiener indices were negatively correlated with the disease index and with the incidence of tobacco blank shank in cultivars K326, YUN85, D101 and GUI1, which was further supported by the evaluation of endophytic community similarity. Our results contribute to the understanding of functions and diversity of endophytic fungi, and culturable endophytic fungal strains may be considered potential libraries for screening novel bioactive and effective metabolites to control P. parasitica in crops which requires further research.","J","Wang, MS; Sun, JL; Wei, YL; Jia, YL; Zou, X",NA,"","","Wang, Maosheng; Sun, Jialong; Wei, Yali; Jia, Yanlong; Zou, Xiao",NA,NA,"Diversity and importance of culturable endophytic fungi of tobacco (Nicotinana tabacum) cultivated in southwestern China","JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sun, Jialong/IYS-1675-2023","Sun, Jialong/0000-0001-5854-6434",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0931-1785","1439-0434","",NA,NA,"SEP",2022,170,"9",NA,"","",NA,"614","625","","10.1111/jph.13126","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jph.13126","","JUN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000815358300001","View Full Record in Web of Science",192,"Presence"

The dual assay results showed that out of 110 fungal endophytes, Diaporthe phaseolorum BUP3/1 and Macrophomina phaseolina BUP2/3, isolated from Jerusalem artichoke and Daldinia eschscholtzii 2NTYL11 and Trichoderma erinaceum ST-KKU2, isolated from Stemona root and ginger could effectively inhibited the mycelial growth of S. rolfsii at 76.00, 41.20, 66.67 and 63.63%, respectively. The beta-1,3 glucanase and chitinase activities of all endophytic fungi was determined which reached the maximum after 2 and 7 days of incubation, respectively. In addition, Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) observation showed that T. erinaceum ST-KKU2 has predatory mechanism aginst S. rolfsii via coiling and invasion. Interestingly, our endophytic fungi T. erinaceum ST-KKU2 and D. eschscholtzii 2NTYL11 were the first species in their genera to produce polyketides group as 6-n-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one (6PAP) and 2,3-dihydro-5-hydroxy-2-methyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (DHMB), respectively, to control S. rolfsii. Moreover, the antagonistic mechanisms of all endophytes were determined in vivo under greenhouse condition. The endophytic fungi, T. erinaceum ST-KKU2 and D. eschscholtzii 2NTYL11 also showed high level of reduction of southern stem rot disease by 58.14% under pot experiment. Such effects were also higher than the effects of other endophytic fungi isolated from Jerusalem artichoke when tested under greenhouse condition. Our experiments showed the fungal endophytes isolated have potential for further development as a biocontrol agent in the future.","J","Suebrasri, T; Somteds, A; Harada, H; Kanokmedhakul, S; Jogloy, S; Ekprasert, J; Lumyong, S; Boonlue, S",NA,"","","Suebrasri, Thanapat; Somteds, Apisara; Harada, Hiroyuki; Kanokmedhakul, Somdej; Jogloy, Sanun; Ekprasert, Jindarat; Lumyong, Saisamorn; Boonlue, Sophon",NA,NA,"Novel endophytic fungi with fungicidal metabolites suppress sclerotium disease","RHIZOSPHERE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"; Hiroyuki, Harada/J-7684-2017","Ekprasert, Jindarat/0000-0002-9646-9078; Hiroyuki, Harada/0000-0003-0839-5193; Boonlue, Sophon/0000-0002-2411-6863",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2452-2198","",NA,NA,"DEC",2020,16,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","100250","10.1016/j.rhisph.2020.100250","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rhisph.2020.100250","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000595138700004","View Full Record in Web of Science",195,"Presence"
"Metal-resistant endophytic fungi from roots improved phytoremediation efficacy of host plants; however, the effects of endophytic fungi from plant aerial parts on host plants are unknown. The aim of this study was to develop a feasible method to screen fungal endophytes from stems and roots of Brassica napus and to investigate effects of the endophytic fungi on growth and phytoremediation efficiency of the plant. Endophytic Fusarium sp. CBRF44, Penicillium sp. CBRF65, and Alternaria sp. CBSF68 with different traits were isolated from roots and stems of rapes grown in a metal-contaminated soil. Fusarium sp. CBRF44 (resistant to 5 mM Cd and 15 mM Pb, isolated from roots) and Alternaria sp. CBSF68 (resistant to 1 mM Cd and 10 mM Pb, isolated from stems) could produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and siderophore; Penicillium sp. CBRF65 (tolerate 2 mM Cd and 20 mM Pb, isolated from roots) could not produce IAA and siderophore but showed the highest phosphate-solubilizing activities. Fusarium sp. CBRF44 and Penicillium sp. CBRF65 significantly increased the rape biomass and promoted the extraction efficacy of Pb and Cd, while Alternaria sp. CBSF68 did not show similar results. Penicillium sp. CBRF65 and Fusarium sp. CBRF44 could be frequently recovered from inoculated rape roots, while Alternaria sp. CBSF68 was scarcely recovered. The results indicate that the colonizing capacity of endophytic fungi in roots is important to improve phytoremediation efficacy of host plants.","J","Shi, YA; Xie, HR; Cao, LX; Zhang, RD; Xu, ZC; Wang, ZY; Deng, ZJ",NA,"","","Shi, Yanan; Xie, Huarong; Cao, Lixiang; Zhang, Renduo; Xu, Zaichao; Wang, Zhuoya; Deng, Zujun",NA,NA,"Effects of Cd- and Pb-resistant endophytic fungi on growth and phytoextraction of Brassica napus in metal-contaminated soils","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0944-1344","1614-7499","",NA,NA,"JAN",2017,24,"1",NA,"","",NA,"417","426","","10.1007/s11356-016-7693-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-016-7693-y","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27726080,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000392105700040","View Full Record in Web of Science",196,"Presence"
"The development of reliable and eco-friendly processes for the synthesis of metal sulphide quantum dots has been considered as a major challenge in the field of nanotechnology. In the present study, polycrystalline ZnS quantum dots were synthesized from an endophytic fungus Aspergillus flavus. It is noteworthy that apart from being rich sources of bioactive compounds, endophytic fungus also has the ability to mediate the synthesis of nanoparticles. TEM and DLS revealed the formation of spherical particles with an average diameter of about 18 nm and 58.9 nm, respectively. The ZnS quantum dots were further characterized using SEM, EDAX, XRD, UV-visible spectroscopy and FTIR. The obtained results confirmed the synthesis of polycrystalline ZnS quantum dots and these quantum dots are used for studying ROS activity. In addition this paper explains kinetics of metal sorption to study the role of biosorption in synthesis of quantum dots by applying Morris-Weber kinetic model. Since Aspergillus flavus is isolated from a medicinal plant Nothapodytes foetida, quantum dots synthesized from this fungus may have great potential in broad environmental and medical applications.

"Plant-associated fungi (endophytic fungi) are a biodiversity-rich group of microorganisms that are normally found asymptomatically within plant tissues or in the intercellular spaces. Endophytic fungi promote the growth of host plants by directly producing secondary metabolites, which enhances the plant's resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Additionally, they are capable of biosynthesizing medically important phytochemicals that were initially thought to be produced only by the host plant. In this review, we summarized some compounds from endophyte fungi with novel structures and diverse biological activities published between 2011 and 2021, with a focus on the origin of endophytic fungi, the structural and biological activity of the compounds they produce, and special attention paid to the exploration of pharmacological activities and mechanisms of action of certain compounds.

"Endophytic fungi are a remarkably diverse group of microorganisms that have imperceptible associations with their hosts for at least a part of their life cycle. The enormous biological diversity and the capability of producing bioactive secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, terpenoids, and polyketides have attracted the attention of different scientific communities, resulting in numerous investigations on these fungal endophytes. During our surveys of plant-root-based fungi in the mountain areas of Qingzhen, Guizhou Province, several isolates of endophytic fungi were identified. In this study, a novel endophytic fungus was discovered in the roots of a medicinal plant (Orixa japonica) in Southern China and introduced as a new species (Amphisphaeria orixae) based on morphological evidence and molecular phylogenetic analysis (combined ITS and LSU sequence data). To the best of our knowledge, A. orixae is the first reported endophyte as well as the first hyphomycetous asexual morph in Amphisphaeria. A new isocoumarin, (R)-4,6,8-trihydroxy-5-methylisochroman-1-one (1), and 12 known compounds (2-13) were isolated from the rice fermentation products of this fungus. Using 1D- and 2D-NMR, mass spectrometry, and ECD studies, their structures were identified. The antitumor activity of these compounds was tested. Unfortunately, none of the compounds tested showed significant antitumor activity.","J","Wang, XJ; Wanasinghe, DN; Zhang, JY; Ma, J; Zhou, PF; Zhang, LJ; Lu, YZ; Zhang, Z",NA,"","","Wang, Xiaojie; Wanasinghe, Dhanushka N.; Zhang, Jingyi; Ma, Jian; Zhou, Peifeng; Zhang, Lijuan; Lu, Yongzhong; Zhang, Zhen",NA,NA,"Insights from the Endophytic Fungi in Amphisphaeria (Sordariomycetes): A. orixae sp. nov. from Orixa japonica and Its Secondary Metabolites","MICROORGANISMS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wanasinghe, Dhanushka/P-1693-2017","Wanasinghe, Dhanushka/0000-0003-1759-3933",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2076-2607","",NA,NA,"MAY 11",2023,11,"5",NA,"","",NA,"","","1268","10.3390/microorganisms11051268","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11051268","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37317242,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000996681400001","View Full Record in Web of Science",199,"Presence"
"Camptothecine (Campothecin, CPT), a quinoline alkaloid, is a potent inhibitor of eukaryotic topoisomerase I. Several semi-synthetic derivatives of CPT are in clinical use against ovarian, small lung and refractory ovarian cancers. While CPT is produced by several plant species belonging to the Asterid clade, in recent years, efforts have been made to isolate endophytic fungi from some of these plants as possible alternative sources of CPT. In this study we report the isolation of three endophytic fungi from fruit and seed regions of Miquelia dentata (Icacinaceae), that produce CPT, 9-methoxy CPT (9-MeO-CPT) and 10-hydroxy CPT (10-OH-CPT). All the three fungi identified as, Fomitopsis sp. P. Karst (MTCC 10177), Alternaria alternate (Fr.) Keissl (MTCC 5477) and Phomposis sp. (Sacc.) produced CPT, 9-MeO-CPT and 10-OH-CPT in mycelial mats in shake flasks containing potato dextrose broth. Methanolic and ethyl acetate extracts of these fungal species were cytotoxic to colon and breast cancer cell lines.

"Huperzia serrata has many important medicinal properties with proven pharmacological potential. Some of these properties may be mediated by its endophytic fungi. To test this hypothesis, in the present study, we provided a first insights into evaluating the species composition and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory activity of the culturable endophytic fungi of H. serrata from the regional at Jinggang Mountain in southeastern China. A total number of 885 fungal isolates distributed across 44 genera and 118 putative species were obtained from 1422 fragments of fine H. serrata roots, stems and leaves base on ITS-rDNA sequences BLAST analysis. The endophytic fungi were phylogenetically diverse and species-rich, with high rate of colonization and isolation. The assemble of endophytic fungi consisted mainly of Ascomycota (97.15 %), followed by Basidiomycota (1.92 %) and unknown fungal species (0.90 %). Colletotrichum (64.29 %), Phyllosticta (3.39 %), Hypoxylon (2.81 %), Xylaria (2.25 %) and Nigrospora (2.04 %) were the most abundant genera, whereas the remaining genera were infrequent groups. Although, roots yielded low abundance strains, the diverse and species-rich were both higher than that of stems and leaves. In addition, out of the 247 endophytic fungi strains determinated, 221 fungal extracts showed AChE inhibition activities in vitro. Among them, 22 endophytic fungi strains achieved high inhibitory activity (>= 50 %) on AChE which belongs to 13 genera and five incertae sedis strains. Four endophytic fungi designated as JS4 (Colletotrichum spp.), FL14 (Ascomycota spp.), FL9 (Sarcosomataceae spp.) and FL7 (Dothideomycetes spp.) were displayed highly active (>= 80 %) against AChE, which the inhibition effects were even more intense than the positive control. Our findings highlight that H. serrata grown in Jinggang Mountain harbors a rich and fascinating endophytic fungus community with potential AChE inhibitory activity, which could further broaden the natural acetylcholinesterase inhibitors resources used for Alzheimer's disease treatment.","J","Wang, Y; Lai, Z; Li, XX; Yan, RM; Zhang, ZB; Yang, HL; Zhu, D",NA,"","","Wang, Ya; Lai, Zheng; Li, Xi-Xi; Yan, Ri-Ming; Zhang, Zhi-Bin; Yang, Hui-Lin; Zhu, Du",NA,NA,"Isolation, diversity and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity of the culturable endophytic fungi harboured in Huperzia serrata from Jinggang Mountain, China","WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Zhu, Du/0000-0003-3184-2844",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0959-3993","1573-0972","",NA,NA,"FEB",2016,32,"2",NA,"","",NA,"","","20","10.1007/s11274-015-1966-3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-015-1966-3","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,26745980,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000370168200003","View Full Record in Web of Science",201,"Presence"

"The objective of this study was to characterize an endophytic fungi producing-bioactive compound from the aquatic plant, Nelumbo nucifera. All parts of such plant were cleaned with surface sterilization technique and cultured on potato dextrose agar to isolate endophytic fungi. The identification was characterized by morphological and molecular technique. Fungal isolates were screened to discover antimicrobial activities by disc diffusion method against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus DMST20651 (MRSA). MIC and MBC for those crude fungal extracts were determined. Finally, the chemical profile of crude extract was determined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Six endophytic fungi were isolated from the surface-satirized parts of N. nucifera. Based on disc diffusion assay, the highest antibacterial activity against MRSA was isolate ST9.1 identified as Aspergillus cejpii. Results demonstrated that the ethyl acetate extraction had more active fractions with MIC of 2.5 mg/ml and MBC concentration of 50.0 mg/ml. The crude extracts were developed to identify the chemical constituents by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The major component of crude extract of endophytic fungi was 5-(1H-Indol-3-yl)-4,5-dihydro-[1,2,4]triazin-3-ylamine (C11H11N5). Thus, the plant could be used in the treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacterial pathogen. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

"Drought is one of the major constraints in rainfed paddyfield production. Drought stress condition caused by long drought that often happens lately andit was major problem causing decreased paddy productivity. The research aimed to determine the chlorophyll concentration of paddy plants treated with endophytic fungi and drought. The research was conducted on farmer's paddy field in Galesong Sub-district of Gowa Regency from August to November 2017. The research consisted of two treatment that puddle height and fungi application. The puddle height treatment consists of two levels i.e. puddle5 cm height (normal) and 1 cm (drought). Endophytic fungi treatment was applied to paddy seeds before planting. Leaf chlorophyll content was measured on 52 days after planting by using SP AD-502 Plus chlorophyll meter.

"In this study, we isolated 15 endophytic fungi from five Sudanese medicinal plants. Each fungal endophytic strain was identified by sequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of rDNA. Ethyl acetate extracts were prepared from each endophyte cultivated in vitro and tested for their respective antibacterial activities and antiproliferative activities against human cancer cells. Antibacterial screening was carried out against two bacterial strains: Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, by the broth dilution method. Cell viability was evaluated by the MTT procedure after exposure of MCF7 breast cancer cells and HT29 or HCT116 human colon adenocarcinoma cells to each endophytic extract. Of interest, Byssochlamys spectabilis isolated from Euphorbia prostata showed cytotoxicity (IC50 = 1.51 +/- 0.2 mu g mL(-1)) against MCF7 cells, but had a low effect against HT29 or HCT116 cells (IC50 > 20 mu g mL(-1)). Cladosporium cladosporioides 2, isolated from Vernonia amygdalina leaves, showed antiproliferative activities against MCF7 cells (IC50 = 10.5 +/- 1.5 mu g mL(-1)) only. On the other hand, B. spectabilis and Alternaria sp. extract had antibacterial activities against the S. aureus strain. The findings of this work revealed that endophytic fungi associated with medicinal plants from Sudan could be considered as an attractive source of new therapeutic compounds.","J","Khiralla, A; Mohamed, IE; Tzanova, T; Schohn, H; Slezack-Deschaumes, S; Hehn, A; André, P; Carre, G; Spina, R; Lobstein, A; Yagi, S; Laurain-Mattar, D",NA,"","","Khiralla, Afra; Mohamed, Ietidal E.; Tzanova, Tzvetomira; Schohn, Herve; Slezack-Deschaumes, Sophie; Hehn, Alain; Andre, Philippe; Carre, Gaelle; Spina, Rosella; Lobstein, Annelise; Yagi, Sakina; Laurain-Mattar, Dominique",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi associated with Sudanese medicinal plants show cytotoxic and antibiotic potential","FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Naselsky, Pavel D/M-4799-2014","Naselsky, Pavel D/0000-0002-8891-0273; Spina, Rosella/0000-0003-0969-2587; Hehn, Alain/0000-0003-4507-8031",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0378-1097","1574-6968","",NA,NA,"JUN",2016,363,"11",NA,"","",NA,"","","fnw089","10.1093/femsle/fnw089","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fnw089","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27190291,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000379032600001","View Full Record in Web of Science",207,"Presence"
"Endophytes that live with plants in a mutualistic symbiosis can be promising biological agents to improve biotic resistance. In this study, 157 endophytic fungi isolates were obtained from from root, stem, and leaf segments of E. japonicus, and they were grouped into 2 phyla, 4 classes, 9 orders, and 26 genera based on characterization of morphological features and variances of ITS1, ITS2, and 5.8 s nrDNA sequences, the Genbank accession numbers of 79 representative endophytic fungi were from MT919117 to MT919195. Of 157 islotates, Ascomycota (99.4%), Sordariomycete (64.3%), Hypocreales (26.8%), and Colletotrichum (14.7%) were the most abundant phylum, class, order, and genus, respectively. The isolation frequency, Species richness(S), Shannon index of diversity (H`) was significantly higher in root than in stem and leaf. Among them, 15 strains exhibited various levels of antagonicstic abilities against two major pathogens, Colletotrichum gloeosporoides and Neopestalotiopsis foedans of E. japonicus, and three others of Botrytis cinerea, Phomopsis sp. and Botryosphaeria dothidea. The isolate ER15, which was classified as Trichoderma sp., exhibited the strongest level of antifungal effect with up to 70% of growth inhibition against these six pathogens in a dual culture assay. These results suggest that ER15 could have potential applications in Anthracnose and branch blight control of E. japonicus.","J","Song, XH; Li, YK; Cao, Z; Wang, DJ",NA,"","","Song, Xiaohe; Li, Yankai; Cao, Zhe; Wang, Dejin",NA,NA,"Diversity assessment of endophytic fungi isolated from Euonymus japonicus","JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1861-3829","1861-3837","",NA,NA,"APR",2022,129,"2",NA,"","",NA,"261","269","","10.1007/s41348-022-00588-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41348-022-00588-6","","FEB 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000760706100001","View Full Record in Web of Science",208,"Presence"
"We isolated endophytic fungi from living healthy leaves, petioles, and current-year twigs of Ginkgo biloba L. from April to November 2004 with the objective of identifying the dominant endophytic fungal taxa, and monitoring their occurrence and frequency. A total of 9 fungal taxa were identified to the genus level. Diversity measures inferred from the Shannon-Wiener, Morisita-Horn, and Sorensen indices indicated that leaves and petioles harbored more diverse endophytic fungal assemblages than twigs, and that fungal taxa involved in twigs shared less with those in leaves and petioles. Among the organs, the occurrence pattern of overall endophytic fungi differed significantly, and two taxa, Phomopsis sp. and Phyllosticta sp., were the most frequently isolated and thus regarded as the dominant endophytic fungi. Phomopsis sp. was isolated frequently from twigs (84.8%) but rather few from leaves (16.1%) and petioles (24.3%). Phyllosticta sp. was isolated frequently from leaves (72.9%) and petioles (65.7%) but was never isolated from twigs. Temporal changes in relative frequency of total endophytic fungi tended to differ among sampling dates for all three organs. The occurrence of Phyllosticta sp. in both leaves and petioles was first detected in August and peaked in October. Phomopsis sp. was detected in twigs throughout the growing season. These results suggest that the distribution of the two dominant endophytic fungi was organ-specific and differed within seasons.","J","Thongsandee, W; Matsuda, Y; Ito, S",NA,"","","Thongsandee, W.; Matsuda, Y.; Ito, S.",NA,NA,"Temporal variations in endophytic fungal assemblages of Ginkgo biloba L.","JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","matsuda, yosuke/0000-0002-7001-3101",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1341-6979","","",NA,NA,"APR",2012,17,"2",NA,"","",NA,"213","218","","10.1007/s10310-011-0292-3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10310-011-0292-3","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000303146700012","View Full Record in Web of Science",209,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi isolated from desert plants are among the less known organisms with potentially valuable applications. The bioactivities of an endophytic fungus isolated from Aloe vera, a plant found in central regions of Asir desert, Saudi Arabia. Based on primary phytochemical screening, an efficient isolate was selected and identified according to the sequence analysis of the internal spacer regions ITS1, ITS4 and the 5.8S region as Preussia africana belonging to the family Sporormiaceae. The crude extract of this fungus was evaluated for its bioactivities. Under static conditions, the crude extract at a concentration of 500 mu g/mL had a strong 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging rate of 87%, whereas a higher concentration (100 mu g/mL) had an astounding wound healing effect (42.6% at 48 h) when compared to positive control. Moreover, the crude extract with a concentration of 50 mu g/mL was active against almost all cancer cell lines such as HeLa (cervical cancer), Hep G2 (liver cancer), MCF-7 (breast cancer), A549 (lung cancer), LN-229 (glioblastoma), A-431 (skin cancer), and kidney cell line (HEK 293T).

"Endophytic fungi are major contributors to fungal diversity and an important component of plant microbiota. Plants growing in biodiversity hotspots and having ethnobotanical utility are often explored for the presence of endophytic fungi with bioactive potential. Western Ghat mountains of India are one of the ten famous biodiversity hotspots in the world. Hence, in the present study, we investigated the diversity of endophytic fungi associated with tissues of Nothapodytes foetida (a tree), Hypericum mysorense (a shrub) and Hypericum japonicum (a herb) collected from forests of Western Ghats with emphasis on diversity of endophytic fungi harbored in different tissues of three plants and their antimicrobial and free radical scavenging activities. A total of 298 isolates belonging to 31 genera were isolated along with dark septate and sterile fungi. All isolates belonged to Dothidiomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes of the phylum Ascomycota. Most frequent colonizers were Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Gliocladium, Cladosporium, Trichoderma, Colletotrichum, and Pestalotiopsis. Endophytes showed neither any host preference nor any dominance of a single species. Ethyl acetate extracts of 39 endophytic fungi exhibited antimicrobial activity against one or more pathogens, of which the activity of Bionectria ochroleuca NOTL33, Chaetomium globosum HYML55, Alternaria brassicae HYMS01, Aspergillus sp. HYML56 was prominent against most of the pathogens tested. 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) free radicals were effectively quenched by the ethyl acetate extracts of 28 isolates and 34 isolates, respectively. This study is the first of its kind in H. mysorense and H. japonicum, and not only describes the endophytic diversity of these plants but also emphasizes the bioactive potential of endophytic isolates for future use in agricultural, pharmaceutical and industrial applications.","J","Samaga, PV; Rai, VR",NA,"","","Samaga, Pradeepa Vasudeva; Rai, Vittal Ravishankar",NA,NA,"Diversity and bioactive potential of endophytic fungi from Nothapodytes foetida, Hypericum mysorense and Hypericum japonicum collected from Western Ghats of India","ANNALS OF MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1590-4261","1869-2044","",NA,NA,"MAR",2016,66,"1",NA,"","",NA,"229","244","","10.1007/s13213-015-1099-9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13213-015-1099-9","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000370078700021","View Full Record in Web of Science",211,"Presence"

"Endophytic fungi have been explored not just for their ecological functions but also for their secondary metabolites as a new source of these pharmacologically active natural products. Accordingly, many structurally unique and biologically active compounds have been obtained from the cultures of endophytic fungi. Fusarium sp. and Lasiodiplodia theobromae were isolated from the root and stem of the mangrove plant Avicennia lanata, respectively, collected from Terengganu, Malaysia. High-resolution mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy were used as metabolomics profiling tools to identify and optimize the production of bioactive secondary metabolites in both strains at different growth stages and culture media. The spectral data was processed by utilizing Mzmine 2, a quantitative expression analysis software and an in house MS-Excel macro coupled with the Dictionary of Natural Products databases for dereplication studies. The investigation for the potential bioactive metabolites from a 15-day rice culture of Fusarium sp. yielded four 1,4- naphthoquinone with naphthazarin structures (1-4). On the other hand, the endophytic fungus L. theobromae grown on the 15-day solid rice culture produced dihydroisocoumarins (5-8). All the isolated compounds (1-8) showed significant activity against Trypanosoma brucei brucei with MIC values of 0.32-12.5 mu M. Preliminary cytotoxicity screening against normal prostate cells (PNT2A) was also performed. All compounds exhibited low cytotoxicity, with compounds 3 and 4 showing the lowest cytotoxicity of only 22.3% and 38.6% of the control values at 100 mu g/mL, respectively.

"Endophytic fungal communities have attracted a great attention to chemists, ecologists, and microbiologists as a treasure trove of biological resource. Endophytic fungi play incredible roles in the ecosystem including abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, eco-adaptation, enhancing growth and development, and maintaining the health of their host. In recent times, endophytic fungi have drawn a special focus owing to their indispensable diversity, unique distribution, and unparalleled metabolic pathways. The endophytic fungal communities belong to three phyla, namely Mucoromycota, Basidiomycota, and Ascomycota with seven predominant classes Agaricomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Mortierellomycotina, Mucoromycotina, Saccharomycetes, and Sordariomycetes. In a review of a huge number of research finding, it was found that endophytic fungal communities of genera Aspergillus, Chaetomium, Fusarium, Gaeumannomyces, Metarhizium, Microsphaeropsis, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Piriformospora, Talaromyces, Trichoderma, Verticillium, and Xylaria have been sorted out and well characterized for diverse biotechnological applications for future development. Furthermore, these communities are remarkable source of novel bioactive compounds with amazing biological activity for use in agriculture, food, and pharmaceutical industry. Endophytes are endowed with a broad range of structurally unique bioactive natural products, including alkaloids, benzopyranones, chinones, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and quinines. Subsequently, there is still an excellent opportunity to explore novel compounds from endophytic fungi among numerous plants inhabiting different niches. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing could be a tool to study interaction between plants and endophytic fungi which may provide further opportunities to reveal unknown functions of endophytic fungal communities.

Anti-mycobacterial activity of metabolites was determined by Microtitre Plate Alamar Blue Assay (MABA) against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC27294) and also evaluated the antioxidant potentials using 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging assay. The cytotoxicity test was performed against breast cancer cell line MCF-7 using MTT assay. Results: Three secondary metabolites were characterized as 6- (heptacosa- 18' Z enyl)- 2- (- 18 '' hydroxyl- 1 '' enyl- 19 '' oxy)- 3 hydroxy benzoquinone (1), (3 beta -5 alpha-dihydroxy -6 beta- phenyl acetyloxy - ergosta -7, 22 - diene) (2) and 2- dodecanol (3). The results of bio-assays revealed that the compound (1) and (2) exhibit significant inhibition of mycobacterium with MIC of 6.25 mu g/ml and 25 mu g/ml respectively, which is similar to the standard streptomycin drug. It also exhibit good DPPH scavenging potential of 72.07 +/- 1.95 and 71.63 +/- 1.40 % respectively. The cytotoxicity was tested against breast cancer cell line MCF-7 and found compound 1 and 2 had cytotoxicity of 52% and 49% respectively at 100 mu g/mL. Conclusion: The present study indicated that the isolated secondary metabolites from the endophytic fungus C. cupreum could be a potential lead molecule of antimicrobial agents.","J","Shylaja, G; Sathiavelu, A",NA,"","","Shylaja, Gunasekaran; Sathiavelu, Arunachalam",NA,NA,"Evaluation of Bioactive Metabolites Isolated from Endophytic Fungus Chaetomium cupreum of the Plant Mussaenda luteola","INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0019-5464","","",NA,NA,"JUL-SEP",2019,53,"3",NA,"2","",NA,"S255","S263","","10.5530/ijper.53.3s.95","http://dx.doi.org/10.5530/ijper.53.3s.95","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000484782400006","View Full Record in Web of Science",218,"Presence"
"Aims: Endophytic fungi are a diverse group of microorganisms that stay asymptomatically in the healthy tissues of the host. Many fungal endophytes are associated with the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) and the pathogens of the tea plant have the potential to grow as endophytes or act as latent pathogens during the initial growth of the plant. The present study aimed at screening tea endophytic fungi with the potential for control of a few critical phytopathogens, Fusarium sp., Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Pestalotiopsis sp. and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum while evaluating the efficiency of growth inhibition of these phytopathogens by the endophytic fungal isolates using in vitro assays.Methodology and results: Five endophytic fungal strains; Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. siamense, Daldinia eschscholtzii, Pseudopestalotiopsis chinensis and Phyllosticta capitalensis isolated from leaves of C. sinensis in Sri Lanka were evaluated for growth inhibition against plant pathogens; Fusarium sp., L. theobromae, Pestalotiopsis sp. and S. sclerotiorum using the dual culture assay and volatile compound-mediated inhibition assay. All the fungal endophytes used in this study exhibited antifungal activity against Fusarium sp., Pestalotiopsis sp. and S. sclerotiorum in the dual culture assay on PDA. Daldinia eschscholtzii (67.30%) and C. gloeosporioides (61.54%) showed strong antagonistic activity against S. sclerotiorum, while P. capitalensis (42.30%) demonstrated moderate activity. All the endophytic fungal strains showed moderate antifungal activities against Fusarium sp. The percentage growth inhibitions of Pestalotiopsis sp. by all the endophytic isolates tested were below 25.00%. In the volatile compound-mediated inhibition assay, none of the endophytic isolates showed visible inhibition against the phytopathogens used.Conclusion, significance and impact of study: In this study, the fungal endophytes which showed potential antagonistic activity against the tested phytopathogens can be used to develop commercialized products of fungal biocontrol agents (BCAs) for controlling plant fungal diseases.","J","Thambugala, K; Daranagama, D; Kannangara, S",NA,"","","Thambugala, Kasun; Daranagama, Dinushani; Kannangara, Sagarika",NA,NA,"Biocontrol potential of endophytic fungi in tea (Camellia sinensis (L.)

"Background: Many biologically important bioactive compounds have been identified in Calophyllum tomentosum extract. Hence, we aimed to identify different endophytic fungal species from different parts of the plants and their bioactive compounds. Objective: The study includes identification and characterization of bioactive compounds in the extracts of endophytic fungal species of Calophyllum tomentosum. Methods: Different parts were used to assess the different endophytic fungi. Two different solvents were used: extracts and qualitative solvents. TLC and GC -MS were employed to identify the bioactive compounds. The bioactive compounds producing endophytes were identified by usingl 8S rRNA. Results: In total, 13 different fungal species were identified from different parts of the Calophyllum tomentosum. The C. tomentosum leaf part showed seven different fungal endophytes from the barks (four) and stems (two). The methanol extract of Fusarium species (stem), Cladosporium species (bark) and hexane extract of Alternaria species (bark) showed a higher amount of coumarins in qualitative methods and TLC. Based on the above results, for further GC -MS and molecular identification studies, we selected three endophytes. In the GC -MS analysis, the methanol extract of Fusarium species (stem) showed psoralen, and furocoumarin (imperatonin or ammidin); Cladosporium species (bark) showed coumarin (2H-1-benzopyran-2-one), coumaric acid (3-benzofurancarboxylic acid), hynecromone (coumarin 4), 4-hydroxy-9-(3 -methy1-2-butyl)furo(3,2-g)chloronen-7one; and hexane extract of Alternaria species (bark) showed coumaric acid (3-benzofurancarboxylic acid). The three fungal endophytes were identified as Fusarium equiseti, Cladosporium uredinicola and Alternaria alternata from 18S rRNA analysis. Conclusion: Based on the above results, the three endophytic fungal species confirm the presence of coumarins and therefore, can be used for the production of coumarins instead of the plant.","J","Channabasava; Melappa, G",NA,"","","Channabasava; Melappa, Govindappa",NA,NA,"Identification of Bioactive Coumarin(s) from Three Endophytic Fungal Species of Calophyllum tomentosum","NATURAL PRODUCTS JOURNAL","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Melappa, Govindappa/AFU-5669-2022","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2210-3155","2210-3163","",NA,NA,"",2020,10,"4",NA,"","",NA,"502","512","","10.2174/2210315509666190430145906","http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/2210315509666190430145906","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000569090100016","View Full Record in Web of Science",220,"Presence"
"Aims: Endophytic fungi are organisms that colonize living plant tissues without causing significant symptoms of diseases. They are known as the repository of bioactive compounds. This study was aimed to isolate endophytic fungi associated with Aloe vera and to assess their antimicrobial activity against the diabetic wound pathogens that result to lower limb amputations. Methodology and results: In this study, 84 endophytic fungi were isolated from A. vera by using 5% sodium hypochlorite and 70% ethanol as surface sterilants. On preliminary antimicrobial screening by agar plug assay, 12 (14.3%) isolates showed significant antagonistic activity on the test microorganisms. Two of the endophytes were identified as Aspergillus flavus and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides through morphological and molecular techniques. The fungal cultures fermented in shake flask were extracted subsequently with hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol. Ethyl acetate and dichloromethane extracts of A. flavus and C. gloeosporioides inhibited all test bacteria. The compounds in the extracts were seemed to be semi-polar in nature. On broth microdilution assay, minimal inhibitory and minimal lethality concentration of ethyl acetate extracts of the fungi were found in the range of 0.63-2.50 and 1.25-5.00 mg/mL, respectively. Conclusion, significance and impact of study: This study reveals that A. vera harbours a wide diversity of endophytic fungi. A. flavus and C. gloeosporioides showing broad spectrum antimicrobial activity on wound pathogens may be potential sources of bioactive compounds.

"There is an intricate network of relations between endophytic fungi and their hosts that affects the production of various bioactive compounds. Plant-associated endophytic fungi contain industrially important enzymes and have the potential to fulfil their rapid demand in the international market to boost business in technology. Being safe and metabolically active, they have replaced the usage of toxic and harmful chemicals and hold a credible application in biotransformation, bioremediation and industrial processes. Despite these, there are limited reports on fungal endophytes that can directly cater to the demand and supply of industrially stable enzymes. The underlying reasons include low endogenous production and secretion of enzymes from fungal endophytes which have raised concern for widely accepted applications. Hence, it is imperative to augment the biosynthetic and secretory potential of fungal endophytes. Modern state-of-the-art biotechnological technologies aiming at strain improvement using cell factory engineering as well as precise gene editing like Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and its Associated proteins (Cas) systems which can provide a boost in fungal endophyte enzyme production. Additionally, it is vital to characterize optimum conditions to grow one strain with multiple enzymes (OSME). The present review encompasses various plants-derived endophytic fungal enzymes and their applications in various sectors. Furthermore, we postulate the feasibility of new precision approaches with an aim for strain improvement and enhanced enzyme production.","J","Raghav, D; Jyoti, A; Siddiqui, AJ; Saxena, J",NA,"","","Raghav, Divyangi; Jyoti, Anupam; Siddiqui, Arif Jamal; Saxena, Juhi",NA,NA,"Plant-associated endophytic fungi as potential bio-factories for extracellular enzymes: Progress, Challenges and Strain improvement with precision approaches","JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Siddiqui, Arif Jamal/Z-5214-2019","Siddiqui, Arif Jamal/0000-0002-6236-0920; Saxena, Juhi/0000-0001-7555-4292",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1364-5072","1365-2672","",NA,NA,"AUG",2022,133,"2",NA,"","",NA,"287","310","","10.1111/jam.15574","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.15574","","APR 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35396804,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000787777700001","View Full Record in Web of Science",222,"Review"
"Endophytic fungi from medicinal plants with specific pharmacological functions attract much attention to provide the possibility of discovering valuable natural drugs with novel structures and biological activities. Nervilia fordii is a rare and endangered karst endemic plant that is used as medicine and food homology in Guangxi, China. These plants have been reported to have antimicrobial, antitumor, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory activities. However, few studies have focused on the diversity and antibacterial activity of endophytic fungi from N. fordii. In the present study, 184 endophytic fungi were isolated from the healthy tissues of N. fordii, and their molecular diversity and antimicrobial activities were analyzed for the first time. These fungi were categorized into 85 different morphotypes based on the morphological characteristics and the similarity between the target sequence and the reference sequence in the GenBank database. With the exception of 18 unidentified fungi, the fungal isolates belonged to at least 2 phyla, 4 classes, 15 orders, 45 known genera, and 45 different species, which showed high abundance, rich diversity, and obvious tissue specificity. All isolates were employed to screen for their antimicrobial activities via the agar diffusion method against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida tropicalis. Among these endophytes, eight strains (9.41%) displayed inhibitory activity against E. coli, 11 strains (12.94%) against S. aureus, and two strains (2.35%) against C. tropicalis, to some extent. In particular, our study showed for the first time that the fungal agar plugs of Penicillium macrosclerotiorum 1151# exhibited promising antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus. Moreover, the ethyl acetate (EA) extract of P. macrosclerotiorum 1151# had antibacterial effects against E. coli and S. aureus with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.5 mg ml(-1). Further research also confirmed that one of the antimicrobial compounds of P. macrosclerotiorum 1151# was methyl chloroacetate and exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus up to 1.71-fold and 1.13-fold compared with tetracycline (TET) (5 mg ml(-1)), respectively. Taken together, the present data suggest that various endophytic fungi of N. fordii could be exploited as sources of novel natural antimicrobial agents.","J","Zhou, YQ; Yao, SC; Wang, J; Xie, XY; Tan, XM; Huang, RS; Yang, XF; Tan, Y; Yu, LY; Fu, P",NA,"","","Zhou, Ya-Qin; Yao, Shao-Chang; Wang, Jie; Xie, Xin-Yi; Tan, Xiao-Ming; Huang, Rong-Shao; Yang, Xin-Feng; Tan, Yong; Yu, Li-Ying; Fu, Peng",NA,NA,"Cultivable endophytic fungal community associated with the karst endemic plant Nervilia fordii and their antimicrobial activity","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"fu, peng/JER-6786-2023","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1664-302X","",NA,NA,"NOV 24",2022,13,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","1063897","10.3389/fmicb.2022.1063897","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1063897","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36504825,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000894111000001","View Full Record in Web of Science",223,"Presence"
"Subterranean rodents are considered major soil engineers, as they can locally modify soil properties by their burrowing activities. In this study, the effect of a subterranean rodent of the genus Ctenomys on soil properties and root endophytic fungal propagules in a shrub desert of northwest Argentina was examined. Our main goal was to include among root endophytic fungi not only arbuscular mycorrhiza but also the dark septate endophytes. We compared the abundance of fungal propagules as well as several microbiological and physicochemical parameters between soils from burrows and those from the surrounding landscape. Our results show that food haulage, the deposition of excretions, and soil mixing by rodents' burrowing promote soil patchiness by (1) the enrichment in both types of root endophytic fungal propagules; (2) the increase in organic matter and nutrients; and (3) changes in soil edaphic properties including moisture, field capacity, and texture. These patches may play a critical role as a source of soil heterogeneity in desert ecosystems, where burrows constructed in interpatches of bare soil can act, once abandoned, as islands of fertility, promoting the establishment of plants in an otherwise hostile environment.","J","Miranda, V; Rothen, C; Yela, N; Aranda-Rickert, A; Barros, J; Calcagno, J; Fracchia, S",NA,"","","Miranda, Victoria; Rothen, Carolina; Yela, Natalia; Aranda-Rickert, Adriana; Barros, Johana; Calcagno, Javier; Fracchia, Sebastian",NA,NA,"Subterranean Desert Rodents (Genus Ctenomys) Create Soil Patches Enriched in Root Endophytic Fungal Propagules","MICROBIAL ECOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Aranda Rickert, Adriana/0000-0001-7378-7519",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0095-3628","1432-184X","",NA,NA,"FEB",2019,77,"2",NA,"","",NA,"451","459","","10.1007/s00248-018-1227-8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-018-1227-8","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30003276,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000460479100016","View Full Record in Web of Science",224,"Presence"
"Forage plants is the base of beef and dairy cattle production.

"This study was intended to isolate and investigate endophytic fungi and its metabolite as an active biocontrol agent. Endophytic fungal secondary metabolites are considered as an effective and environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic chemicals for integrated pest management. In this study, different parts of medicinal plant Plectranthus amboinicus (Oregano) were selected to isolate twenty-three fungal endophytes. Out of twenty-three, one isolate demonstrates potent activities against cotton leaf worm Spodoptera litura (S. litura) an insecticides resistance pest. Identification of potent isolate was attained through the morphological, sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis of the ITS regions and confirmed as Aspergillus sojae (A. sojae). The GCMS analysis reveals the metabolites of A. sojae were rich in 2-Furancarboxaldehyde and Levoglucosenone then other compounds. The FTIR peaks of A. sojae crude extract shows the major peaks that corresponding to N-H, C-H, and O-H stretching and minor peaks are C-H bend (meta) and acetylenic C-H bend. FTIR analysis supports the presence of functional groups in accordance with GCMS data as dominating compound. The bioassay results showed that A. sojae metabolite affects third and fourth instar larvae of S. litura. In addition, antibiotic quality of A. sojae metabolite tested against five selective bacteria. Among five different bacteria, the maximum zone of inhibition was displayed for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in the higher concentration of 100 mu g/mL.

"Aquatic ecosystems contain tremendous plant and microbial diversity. However, little is known about endophyte diversity in aquatic plants. In this study, we investigated the diversity of endophytic fungi in aquatic plants in southwest China using both culture-based and culture-independent high-throughput sequencing methods. A total of 1,689 fungal isolates belonging to three phyla and 154 genera were obtained from 15,373 plant tissue segments of 30 aquatic plant species. The most abundant endophytic fungi were those in ascomycete genera Aspergillus, Ceratophoma, Fusarium, Penicillium, Phoma and Plectosporium. No difference in fungal isolation rates was observed among tissues from roots, stems, and leaves. Twenty tissue samples from three most common plant species were further subjected to culture-independent meta-barcode sequencing. The sequence-based analyses revealed a total of 1,074 OTUs belonging to six fungal phyla and 194 genera. Among the three plants, Batrachium bungei harbored the highest number of OTUs. Besides, a total of 66 genera were detected by two methods. Both the culture-dependent and independent methods revealed that aquatic plants in southwest China have abundant endophytic fungal diversity.

"Endophytic fungi associated with Nigerian plants have recently generated significant interest in drug discovery programmes due to their immense potential to contribute to the discovery of new bioactive compounds. This study was carried out to investigate the secondary metabolites of endophytic fungi isolated from leaves of Newbouldia laevis, Ocimum gratissimum, and Carica papaya. The plants were collected from Agulu, Anambra State, South-East Nigeria. Endophytic fungal isolation, fungal fermentation; and extraction of secondary metabolites were carried out using standard methods. The crude extracts were screened for antimicrobial activities using the agar well diffusion method, and were also subjected to high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis to identify their constituents. A total of five endophytic fungi was isolated, two from N. laevis (NL-L1 and NL-L2), one from O. gratissimum (SL-L1), and two from C. papaya (PPL-LAC and PPL-LE2). In the antimicrobial assay, the extracts of NL-L2, SL-L1, and PPL-LE2 displayed mild antibacterial activity against both Gram negative and Gram positive test bacteria. PPL-LAC extract showed mild activity only against S. aureus, while no antimicrobial activity was recorded for NL-L1 extract. All the endophytic fungal extracts showed no activity against the test fungi C. albicans and A. fumigatus. HPLC analysis of the fungal extracts revealed the presence of ethyl 4-hydroxyphenyl acetate and ferulic acid in NL-L1; ruspolinone in NL-L2; protocatechuic acid, scytalone, and cladosporin in SL-L1; indole-3-acetic acid and indole-3-carbaldehyde in PPL-LE2; and indole-3-acetic acid in PPL-LAC. The findings of this study revealed the potentials possessed by these plants as source of endophytes that express biological active compounds.

"Tropical ecosystems hold an extremely diverse array of endophytic fungi, but their potential use still remains to be explored. In this study, we isolated an endophytic fungus from the leaves of Otoba gracilipes, a medicinal tree from a tropical rainforest in Colombia. Following isolation and cultivation, we evaluated its extracellular crude extract for antioxidant activity. Using traditional and molecular methods (ITS1, NL1 regions), the endophyte was identified as Fusarium oxysporum. Fresh spores from the fungal isolate were inoculated in liquid media (potato dextrose broth [PDB] and potato dextrose-yeast extract broth [PDYB]) and centrifuged for recovering extracellular polysaccharides from the exhausted medium after 30 days of cultivation. Crude extracts were recovered, purified, lyophilized, and evaluated for their ability to inactivate the free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). The extracts obtained from PDB culture media had a 51.5% of scavenging effect on DPPH after 5 min of reaction compared with the extracts from PDBY (26.4%), which suggests a high antioxidant potential of these fungal extracts. Thus, our results suggest other fungi from tropical ecosystems should be explored as potential sources of novel enzymes and other metabolites with bioactivity.","J","Caicedo, NH; Davalos, AF; Puente, PA; Rodríguez, AY; Caicedo, PA",NA,"","","Caicedo, Nelson H.; Davalos, Andres F.; Puente, Paula A.; Rodriguez, Ana Y.; Caicedo, Paola A.",NA,NA,"Antioxidant activity of exo-metabolites produced by Fusarium oxysporum: An endophytic fungus isolated from leaves of Otoba gracilipes","MICROBIOLOGYOPEN","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","CAICEDO, PAOLA A/0000-0002-4517-427X; Davalos, Andres/0000-0001-5953-7900; Puente-Cantillo, Paula/0000-0002-8241-1481",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2045-8827","","",NA,NA,"OCT",2019,8,"10",NA,"","",NA,"","","e903","10.1002/mbo3.903","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mbo3.903","","JUL 2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31297981,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000475148400001","View Full Record in Web of Science",229,"Presence"
"Beneficial interactions between plants and microorganisms have been investigated under different ecological, physiological, biochemical, and genetic aspects. However, the systematic exploration of biomolecules with potential for biotechnological products from this interaction still is relatively scarce. Therefore, this study aimed the evaluation of the diversity and antimicrobial activity of the endophytic fungi obtained from roots, stems and leafs of Myrcia guianensis (Myrtaceae) from the Brazilian Amazon. 156 endophytic fungi were isolated and above 80% were identified by morphological examination as belonging to the genera Pestalotiopsis, Phomopsis, Aspergillus, Xylaria, Nectria, Penicillium and Fusarium. Fermented broth of those fungi were assayed for antimicrobial activity and four inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans and Penicillium avellaneum. As the strain named MgRe2.2.3B (Nectria haematococca) had shown the most promising results against those pathogenic strains, its fermented broth was fractioned and only its two low polar fractions demonstrated to be active. Both fractions exhibited a minimum bactericidal concentration of 50 mu g.mL(-1) against S. aureus and a minimum fungicidal concentration of 100 mu g.mL(-1) against P. avellaneum. These results demonstrate the diversity of fungal genera in M. guianensis and the potential of these endophytic fungi for the production of new antibiotics.","J","dos Banhos, EF; de Souza, AQL; de Andrade, JC; de Souza, ADL; Koolen, HHF; Albuquerque, PM",NA,"","","dos Banhos, Elissandro Fonseca; Lima de Souza, Antonia Queiroz; de Andrade, Juliano Camurca; Leao de Souza, Afonso Duarte; Ferreira Koolen, Hector Henrique; Albuquerque, Patricia Melchionna",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi from Myrcia guianensis at the Brazilian Amazon: Distribution and bioactivity","BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"de Souza, Afonso D.

"Purpose Balanophora polyandra Griff. is a holoparasitic medicinal plant that produces compounds with antibacterial and antioxidant activities. Plant endophytic fungi are an abundant reservoir of bioactive metabolites for medicinal exploitation, and an increasing number of novel bioactive compounds are being isolated from endophytic fungi. The present study investigated the diversity of culturable endophytic fungi from the roots of holoparasite B. polyandra to explore active strains and metabolites. In addition, the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of 22 strains cultured from B. polyandra were also evaluated. Methods The endophytic fungi were identified according to their colony morphology and ITS-5.8S rDNA sequencing. TLC-MTT-Bioautography assays and DPPH radical scavenging assays were employed to assess the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of ethyl acetate extracts of the endophytic fungi. Results One hundred and twenty-five endophytic strains were isolated from the roots of B. polyandra, including 70 from female samples and 55 from male samples. Of them, twenty-two distinct isolates representing 15 genera and 22 species based on their ITS-rDNA genomic sequence were successfully identified from female and male samples of B. polyandra. The genus Calonectria was the most prevalent genus, with a CF% of 18.3, followed by the genera Clonostachys and Botryosphaeria, with CF% values of 13.4 and 10.0, respectively. Interestingly, the fungal extracts exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as potential antioxidant activities with IC50 values ranging from 0.45 to 6.90 mg/mL. Among them, endophytes Bpf-10 (Diaporthe sp.) and Bpf-11 (Botryosphaeria sp.) showed the strongest biological activities and more abundant secondary metabolites. Conclusions This study reported the diversity of endophytic fungi from the roots of B. polyandra and the antibacterial and antioxidant activities of the crude extracts for the first time. The results revealed that B. polyandra contains diverse culturable endophytic fungi that potentially produce natural antibacterial and antioxidant compounds with great value to the agriculture and pharmaceutical industries.","J","Wu, CY; Wang, W; Wang, XQ; Shahid, H; Yang, YT; Wang, YW; Wang, SK; Shan, TJ",NA,"","","Wu, Chunyin; Wang, Wei; Wang, Xiaoqing; Shahid, Hamza; Yang, Yuting; Wang, Yangwen; Wang, Shengkun; Shan, Tijiang",NA,NA,"Diversity and communities of culturable endophytic fungi from the root holoparasite Balanophora polyandra Griff. and their antibacterial and antioxidant activities","ANNALS OF MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"yang, yuting/HTT-2479-2023","Wang, Wei/0000-0002-9932-2848; SHAHID, HAMZA/0000-0001-6638-9889",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1590-4261","1869-2044","",NA,NA,"DEC",2022,72,"1",NA,"","",NA,"","","19","10.1186/s13213-022-01676-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13213-022-01676-6","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000799804800001","View Full Record in Web of Science",235,"Presence"
"Halophilic fungi have evolved unique osmoadaptive strategies, enabling them to thrive in hypersaline habitats. Here, we conduct morphological and transcriptomic response of endophytic fungus (Aspergillus montevidensis ZYD4) in both the presence and absence of salt stress. Under salt stress, the colony morphology of the A. montevidensis ZYD4 changed drastically and exhibited decreased colony pigmentation. Extensive conidiophores development was observed under salt stress; conidiophores rarely developed in the absence of salt stress. Under salt stress, yellowcleistotheciumformation was inhibited, while glycerol and compatible sugars continued to accumulate. Among differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs), 733 of them were up-regulated while 1,619 unigenes were down-regulated. We discovered that genes involved in the accumulation of glycerol, the storage of compatible sugars, organic acids, pigment production, and asexual sporulation were differentially regulated under salt stress.

"Endophytic fungi (EF) are a group of fascinating host-associated fungal communities that colonize the intercellular or intracellular spaces of host tissues, providing beneficial effects to their hosts while gaining advantages. In recent decades, accumulated research on endophytic fungi has revealed their biodiversity, wide-ranging ecological distribution, and multidimensional interactions with host plants and other microbiomes in the symbiotic continuum. In this review, we highlight the role of secondary metabolites (SMs) as effectors in these multidimensional interactions, and the biosynthesis of SMs in symbiosis via complex gene expression regulation mechanisms in the symbiotic continuum and via the mimicry or alteration of phytochemical production in host plants. Alternative biological applications of SMs in modern medicine, agriculture, and industry and their major classes are also discussed.

"Nitric oxide (NO), salicylic acid (SA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important signal molecules that mediate plant resistance reactions and play important roles in secondary metabolism. To research the signal transduction pathway of the endophytic fungal elicitor from Fusarium sp. E5 promoting secondary metabolism in Euphorbia pekinensis suspension cells, the changes in NO, SA, ROS, and isoeuphpekinensin contents in the cells were investigated after elicitor addition to the cell suspension culture. The elicitor did not change H2O2 or O-2 (-) contents notably, whereas NO and SA contents were enhanced. Both the NO donator sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and SA enhanced isoeuphpekinensin content in the absence of the fungal elicitor, whereas the NO scavenger cPTIO and SA biosynthesis inhibitor cinnamic acid (CA) inhibited isoeuphpekinensin accumulation in the presence of the elicitor. In addition, cPTIO inhibited SA production induced by the fungal elicitor. CA did not inhibit NO production, but it significantly inhibited isoeuphpekinensin accumulation. The results demonstrated that in Euphorbia pekinensis suspension cells the endophytic fungal elicitor induced increased NO content and SA production, which promoted isoeuphpekinensin accumulation. ROS are clearly not involved in the endophytic fungus-host interaction signaling pathway.","J","Gao, FK; Ren, CG; Dai, CC",NA,"","","Gao, Fu-Kang; Ren, Cheng-Gang; Dai, Chuan-Chao",NA,NA,"Signaling Effects of Nitric Oxide, Salicylic Acid, and Reactive Oxygen Species on Isoeuphpekinensin Accumulation in Euphorbia pekinensis Suspension Cells Induced by an Endophytic Fungal Elicitor","JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0721-7595","1435-8107","",NA,NA,"DEC",2012,31,"4",NA,"","",NA,"490","497","","10.1007/s00344-012-9258-8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-012-9258-8","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000310544100003","View Full Record in Web of Science",239,"Presence"
"Background: The endophytes of medicinal plants, such as Justicia adhatoda L., represent a promising and largely underexplored domain that is considered as a repository of biologically active compounds. Objectives: The aim of present study was isolation, identification, and biological evaluation of endophytic fungi associated with the J. adhatoda L. plant for the production of antimicrobial, antioxidant, and cytotoxic compounds Materials and Methods: Endophytic fungi associated with the J. adhatoda L. plant were isolated from healthy plant parts and taxonomically characterized through morphological, microscopic, and 18S rDNA sequencing methods. The screening for bioactive metabolite production was achieved using ethyl acetate extracts, followed by the optimization of different parameters for maximum production of bioactive metabolites. Crude and partially purified extracts were used to determine the antimicrobial, antioxidant, and cytotoxic potential Results: Out of six endophytic fungal isolates, Chaetomium sp. NF15 showed the most promising biological activity and was selected for detailed study.

"In bromeliads, nothing is known about the associations fungi form with seeds and seedling roots. We investigated whether fungal associations occur in the seeds and seedling roots of two epiphytic Aechmea species, and we explored whether substrate and fungal associations contribute to seed germination, and seedling survival and performance after the first month of growth. We found a total of 21 genera and 77 species of endophytic fungi in the seeds and seedlings for both Aechmea species by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The fungal associations in seeds were found in the majority of corresponding seedlings, suggesting that fungi are transmitted vertically. Substrate quality modulated the germination and growth of seedlings, and beneficial endophytic fungi were not particularly crucial for germination but contributed positively to survival and growth. Overall, this study provides the first evidence of an endophytic fungal community in both the seeds and seedlings of two epiphytic bromeliads species that subsequently benefit plant growth.

"Background: Endophytes represent a complex community of microorganisms colonizing asymptomatically internal tissues of higher plants. Several reports have shown that endophytes enhance the fitness of their host plants by direct production of bioactive secondary metabolites, which are involved in protecting the host against herbivores and pathogenic microbes. In addition, it is increasingly apparent that endophytes are able to biosynthesize medicinally important phytochemicals, originally believed to be produced only by their host plants. Objective: The present review provides an overview of secondary metabolites from endophytic fungi with pronounced biological activities covering the literature between 2010 and 2017. Special focus is given on studies aiming at exploration of the mode of action of these metabolites towards the discovery of leads from endophytic fungi. Moreover, this review critically evaluates the potential of endophytic fungi as alternative sources of bioactive plant metabolites. Results: Over the past few years, several promising lead structures from endophytic fungi have been described in the literature. In this review, 65 metabolites are outlined with pronounced biological activities, primarily as antimicrobial and cytotoxic agents. Some of these metabolites have shown to be highly selective or to possess novel mechanisms of action, which hold great promises as potential drug candidates. Conclusion: Endophytes represent an inexhaustible reservoir of pharmacologically important compounds. Moreover, endophytic fungi could be exploited for the sustainable production of bioactive plant metabolites in the future. Towards this aim, further insights into the dynamic endophyte - host plant interactions and origin of endophytic fungal genes would be of utmost importance.","J","Ancheeva, E; Daletos, G; Proksch, P",NA,"","","Ancheeva, Elena; Daletos, Georgios; Proksch, Peter",NA,NA,"Bioactive Secondary Metabolites from Endophytic Fungi","CURRENT MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Proksch, Peter/AAR-4593-2020; Daletos, Georgios/AGV-0152-2022","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0929-8673","1875-533X","",NA,NA,"",2020,27,"11",NA,"","SI",NA,"1836","1854","","10.2174/0929867326666190916144709","http://dx.doi.org/10.2174/0929867326666190916144709","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31526342,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000528280500009","View Full Record in Web of Science",242,"Review"
"A total of 139 endophytic fungal isolates derived from 20 medicinal and aromatic plants were tested for their capacity to ferment rose oil distillation wastewater (RODW). Internal transcribed spacer sequence-based phylogenetic analysis affiliated the collected isolates to seven genera and nine different species, of which Alternaria alternata was the most widely represented. The fungal fermentation of RODW was evaluated through analysis of the sugar and phenolics content and phenolics composition. After cultivation in a small volume of RODW, the performed cluster analysis grouped the isolates in four distinct clusters according to their capacity to ferment RODW sugars and phenolics. Further larger volume shake-flask cultivation of a selected subset of fungi with a pronounced RODW fermentation capacity, outlined three groups of isolates with a distinct pattern and dynamics of sugars and phenolics fermentation. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of RODW phenolics extracts following the fermentation by the selected fungal isolates showed two main types of changes in phenolics composition: (1) changes in the relative abundance of part of the RODW phenolic compounds, mainly due to utilization of sugar residues from the RODW phenolic glycosides and (2) biosynthesis of new phenolic compounds, most of which are specific to the endophytic fungal isolates used for RODW fermentation. The overall results of the study clearly demonstrate that endophytic fungal isolates represent a rich and untapped source for efficient fermentation of RODW and other agro-industrial phenolics-rich wastewaters and highlight their capacity for directional changes and modification of RODW phenolics composition towards further wastewater phenolics valorization.","J","Rusanova, M; Rusanov, K; Butterweck, V; Atanassov, I",NA,"","","Rusanova, Mila; Rusanov, Krasimir; Butterweck, Veronika; Atanassov, Ivan",NA,NA,"Exploring the capacity of endophytic fungi isolated from medicinal plants for fermentation and phenolics biotransformation of rose oil distillation wastewater","BIOTECHNOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGICAL EQUIPMENT","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rusanov, Krasimir Emilov/AGU-1689-2022; Rusanova, Mila/GXV-5435-2022","Rusanov, Krasimir Emilov/0000-0001-8131-3364; Rusanova, Mila/0000-0001-8964-6411",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1310-2818","1314-3530","",NA,NA,"JAN 1",2019,33,"1",NA,"","",NA,"651","663","","10.1080/13102818.2019.1607778","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13102818.2019.1607778","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000467815700001","View Full Record in Web of Science",243,"Presence"
"Background The emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens and the lack of new antimicrobial drugs is a major public health concern that needs urgent and innovative solutions. Endophytic fungi living in unique niches such as in endosymbiosis with plants are increasingly drawing attention as alternative sources of novel and chemically diverse compounds with unique mechanisms of action. Methods In the present study, ten endophytic fungi isolated from the medicinal plant, Sclerocarya birrea were screened for bioactivity against a panel of indicator bacteria. Three bioactive endophytic fungi (strains P02PL2, P02MS1, and P02MS2A) were selected and identified through ITS-rDNA sequencing. The whole broth extracts of the three selected isolates were further screened against contemporary drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. This was followed by partial purification by solid phase extraction and GC-MS analysis of bioactive fractions. Results The bioactive endophytic fungi were identified as Alternaria alternata species (strains P02PL2 and P02MS1) and Nigrospora oryzae (strain P02MS2A). The whole broth extracts from N. oryzae P02MS2A exhibited a MIC of one mu g/mL and 16 mu g/mL against gram-negative, MDR Pseudomonas 5625574 and gram-positive MRSA 25775 clinical isolates, respectively. After partial purification and GC-MS analysis of whole broth extract from A. alternaria PO2MS1, 2-fluorobenzoic acid heptadecyl was putatively identified as the active compound in fraction C of this extract. This compound was also putatively identified in fraction E of A. alternata P02PL2, fraction B of A. alternata P02MS1 and fraction B of N. oryzae P02MS2A, and interestingly, all these fractions retained activity against the two MDR clinical isolates. Conclusion The putative identification of 2-fluorobenzoic acid heptadecyl compound showing a broad-spectrum of activity, more especially against gram-negative MDR contemporary pathogens is highly encouraging in the initiative at developing novel drugs to combat multi-drug resistance.","J","Fanele, A; Ndlovu, SI",NA,"","","Fanele, Asiphe; Ndlovu, Sizwe I.",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungal species Nigrospora oryzae and Alternaria alternata exhibit antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative multi-drug resistant clinical bacterial isolates","BMC COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE AND THERAPIES","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2662-7671","",NA,NA,"SEP 15",2023,23,"1",NA,"","",NA,"","","323","10.1186/s12906-023-04157-8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-023-04157-8","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37715184,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001067598800001","View Full Record in Web of Science",244,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi are an important class of microorganisms, able to interact with a host plant via a mutualistic mechanism without visible symptoms of the fungal colonization. The synergy between endophytic fungi and their host plant can promote morphological, physiological and biochemical changes through the expression of bioactive metabolites. This work aims to correlate metabolic changes in the Combretum lanceolatum plant metabolome with its endophytic fungi Diaporthe phaseolorum (Dp) and Trichoderma spirale (Ts), and to discover corresponding metabolite-biomarkers, with the principal focus being on its primary metabolism. The H-1-NMR metabolomic analysis of qualitative and quantitative changes was performed through multivariate statistical analysis and the identification of primary metabolites was achieved on the Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database. The presence of Dp significantly impacted the plant's metabolic pathways, improving the biosynthesis of primary metabolites such as threonine, malic acid and N-acetyl-mannosamine, which are precursors of special metabolites involved in plant self-defence. This work represents a valuable contribution to advanced studies on the metabolic profiles of the interaction of plants with endophytes.","J","Lacerda, JWF; Siqueira, KA; Vasconcelos, LG; Bellete, BS; Dall'Oglio, EL; Sousa, PT; Faraggi, TM; Vieira, LCC; Soares, MA; Sampaio, OM",NA,"","","Lacerda, Jhuly W.

"We isolated and examined two endophytic fungi for their potential to secrete phytohormones viz. gibberellins (GAs) and indoleacetic acid (IAA) and mitigate abiotic stresses like salinity and drought. The endophytic fungi Phoma glomerata LWL2 and Penicillium sp. LWL3 significantly promoted the shoot and allied growth attributes of GAs-deficient dwarf mutant Waito-C and Dongjin-beyo rice. Analysis of the pure cultures of these endophytic fungi showed biologically active GAs (GA(1), GA(3), GA(4) and GA(7)) in various quantities. The cultures of P. glomerata and Penicillium sp. also contained IAA. The culture application and endophytic-association with host-cucumber plants significantly increased the plant biomass and related growth parameters under sodium chloride and polyethylene glycol induced salinity and drought stress as compared to control plants. The endophytic symbiosis resulted in significantly higher assimilation of essential nutrients like potassium, calcium and magnesium as compared to control plants during salinity stress. Endophytic-association reduced the sodium toxicity and promoted the host-benefit ratio in cucumber plants as compared to non-inoculated control plants. The symbiotic-association mitigated stress by compromising the activities of reduced glutathione, catalase, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase. Under stress conditions, the endophyte-infection significantly modulated stress through down-regulated abscisic acid, altered jasmonic acid, and elevated salicylic acid contents as compared to control. In conclusion, the two endophytes significantly reprogrammed the growth of host plants during stress conditions.","J","Waqas, M; Khan, AL; Kamran, M; Hamayun, M; Kang, SM; Kim, YH; Lee, IJ",NA,"","","Waqas, Muhammad; Khan, Abdul Latif; Kamran, Muhammad; Hamayun, Muhammad; Kang, Sang-Mo; Kim, Yoon-Ha; Lee, In-Jung",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungi Produce Gibberellins and Indoleacetic Acid and Promotes Host-Plant Growth during Stress","MOLECULES","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kamran, Muhammad/AFN-3028-2022; Lee, In-Jung/GLS-0432-2022; Kamran, Muhammad/C-8121-2018; Waqas, Muhammad/IYS-9931-2023; Hamayun, Muhammad/I-8015-2015; Hamayun, Muhammad/B-1694-2010","Kamran, Muhammad/0000-0003-4511-7766; Lee, In-Jung/0000-0001-7154-4820; Kamran, Muhammad/0000-0003-4511-7766; Hamayun, Muhammad/0000-0003-4264-5870; Khan, Abdul Latif/0000-0001-9700-8903",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1420-3049","",NA,NA,"SEP",2012,17,"9",NA,"","",NA,"10754","10773","","10.3390/molecules170910754","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules170910754","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,22960869,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000309269700052","View Full Record in Web of Science",250,"Presence"
"The populations of endophytic fungi and actinomycetes from four rice cultivars in the Panyu district (Site 1) and Wushan district (Site 2) in Guangdong province, South China, were studied. The preponderant endophytic fungi and actinomycetes isolated belonged to Fusarium and Streptomyces respectively. The incidence of Streptomycetes griseofuscus ranged from 36.1 to 69% out of all the different rice cultivars from the two sites. It is the commonest population of endophytic actinomycetes, and constituted the greatest part of all the antagonistic communities. The distributions of endophytic fungi and actinomycetes in roots and leaves were different, endophytic fungi from leaves were diverse, some were organ-specific. More diverse endophytic actinomycetes were isolated from roots than from leaves. The endophytic fungi isolated from rice in Site 2 were more diverse than that in Site 1. The diversity of the endophytic actinomycetes, however, was less than that in Site 1. Acid soil in Site 2 is ideal for the growth and colonization of fungi while the alkaline soil in Site I is better for the growth and colonization of actinomycetes. The results suggested that differences in the chemical composition of soil could influence the endophytic microbial communities of rice plants. The endophytic fungi and actinomycetes isolated from poor-growing seedlings and susceptible rice cultivars were more abundant than that the disease-resistant counterparts.

"Simple Summary Endophytic fungi are fungi that live all or part of their life cycles within the tissues of their hosts. Although several endophyte-plant interactions are non-pathogenic in nature, it has been reported that upon infection, some endophytic fungi are able to adopt a pathogenic status resulting in disease symptoms in their host plants, ranging in severity from mild to severe. In the present study, light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to investigate the tissue colonization and cell damage of corn plants by three endophytic fungi, Fusarium verticillioides, Fusarium sacchari, and Penicillium citrinum, causing disease symptoms in the roots, stems, and leaves of infected corn plants. Tissue deterioration and cell collapse were produced by endophytic F. verticillioides, while significant cell proliferation and wall thickening were observed in corn plants infected by endophytic F. sacchari. Corn plants infected by P. citrinum showed reductions in cell diameter of the vascular bundles of infected corn tissues. The ability of endophytic fungi recovered from healthy corn plants to cause disease when inoculated in healthy tissues of other corn plants signifies their importance as determinants of corn health and productivity. Endophytic fungi inhabiting plant tissues show extensive functional diversity, ranging from mutualism to pathogenicity. The present study evaluated the histological responses of corn plants to colonization by three species of endophytic fungi isolated from corn. Corn seedlings were inoculated with 1 x 10(6) conidia per mL spore suspensions of endophytic Fusarium verticillioides, Fusarium sacchari, and Penicillium citrinum and observed for 14 days for the emergence of disease symptoms. Histological examination of diseased root, stem, and leaf tissues was conducted using light and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicated that the mean diameters of root phloem, stem vascular bundles, and leaf vascular bundles, of corn plants infected with endophytic P. citrinum (18.91 mu m, 146.96 mu m, and 107.86 mu m, respectively), F. verticillioides (18.75 mu m, 85.45 mu m, and 118.24 mu m, respectively), and F. sacchari (24.15 mu m root phloem, and 98.90 mu m stem vascular bundle diameters), were significantly lower than the root phloem (33.68 mu m), stem vascular bundle (186.77 mu m), and leaf vascular bundle (155.88 mu m) of the uninfected corn plants (p <= 0.05). Endophytic F. verticillioides was the most virulent, resulting in severe degradation and the eventual collapse of infected plant tissues. The study showed that endophytic fungi recovered from corn plants are capable of initiating significant disease responses in infected corn tissues.","J","Terna, TP; Nor, NMIM; Zakaria, L",NA,"","","Terna, Tersoo P.; Nor, Nik Mohd Izham Mohamed; Zakaria, Latiffah",NA,NA,"Histopathology of Corn Plants Infected by Endophytic Fungi","BIOLOGY-BASEL","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Nor, Nik Mohd Izham Mohamed/AAB-3638-2020","Nor, Nik Mohd Izham Mohamed/0000-0001-7848-5202; Zakaria, Latiffah/0000-0002-2388-1424",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2079-7737","",NA,NA,"MAY",2022,11,"5",NA,"","",NA,"","","641","10.3390/biology11050641","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology11050641","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35625369,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000803519000001","View Full Record in Web of Science",252,"Presence"
"Accumulating evidences from investigations in the last decade have revealed the significant role of endophytes in regulation of plant growth, communication and stress tolerance. Endophytes establish a mutualistic relationship with plants which is known to be beneficial for both the organisms. A large number of endophytic fungi inhabit various plant parts such as leaf, stem, roots. These endophytic fungi are highly assorted in terms of both diversity and specificity with respect to host association. Meta-genomics has made the procedure of identification of these endophytic fungi quick and reliable and furthermore, critical assessment of endophytic diversity associated with different crop plants and in different ecological niches has helped in developing gene pool of beneficial endophytic fungi. Endophytic fungi have been well characterized and offers great advantage to host plants in sustaining growth and development under diverse climatic conditions. Fungal endophytes play an active role in agriculture as biostimulants for augmenting crop production and protection. This will provide eco-friendly ways to the farmers to enhance both quality and quantity without compromising to plant health as well as without harming ecosystem. The present review summarizes the diverse roles of endophytic fungi in enhancement of growth, plant development and stress tolerance to adverse environmental conditions. Our current understanding of the diverse roles of endophytes shall appear beneficial in crop improvement and sustainability.","J","Toppo, P; Subba, R; Roy, K; Mukherjee, S; Mathur, P",NA,"","","Toppo, Prabha; Subba, Rewaj; Roy, Kuheli; Mukherjee, Soumya; Mathur, Piyush",NA,NA,"Elucidating the Strategies for Isolation of Endophytic Fungi and Their Functional Attributes for the Regulation of Plant Growth and Resilience to Stress","JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mathur, Piyush/GSN-1126-2022","SUBBA, REWAJ/0000-0002-8398-1056; MUKHERJEE, SOUMYA/0000-0002-4134-1157; Mathur, Piyush/0000-0002-4481-5506",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0721-7595","1435-8107","",NA,NA,"MAR",2023,42,"3",NA,"","",NA,"1342","1363","","10.1007/s00344-022-10638-w","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-022-10638-w","","MAR 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000773824300001","View Full Record in Web of Science",253,"Review"
"The ability of endophytic fungi isolated from cucurbit plants to suppress soilborne diseases and the relationship between antagonism and disease suppression were studied. In dual culture tests of 1044 strains of 90 genera and three pathogenic fungi, 47.1 % of the endophytic fungal strains showed antagonistic effects on at least one pathogen; 186 strains against Rhizoctonia solani, 371 strains against Sclerotinia sclerotiorwn, and 403 strains against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum. The main antagonistic type of the strains of one genus generally was identical to one pathogen. In the pot experiment of cucumber inoculated with It solani and endophytic fungi, 74.3 % and 33.3 % of 288 strains showed control efficacy of more than 50 % and more than 80 % on cucumber Rhizoctonia root rot respectively. These strains were mostly distributed in Fusarium, Chaetomium, Colletotrichum and Acrocalymma. There were some differences in the proportion of strains with better disease suppressive effects between strain sources. No significant correlation existed between the disease suppression of a strain in vivo and its antagonism against the pathogen in vitro. Most growth-promoting strains had good suppressive effects on cucumber Rhizoctonia root rot. In this study, 82 endophytic fungal strains had good disease suppressive effects and no obvious adverse effects on cucumber growth, and 35 of them showed obvious growth-promoting effects, which suggested that endophytic fungi from cucurbit plants have excellent potential for plant disease control.","J","Huang, LQ; Niu, YC; Su, L; Deng, H; Lyu, H",NA,"","","Huang, Lin-Qi; Niu, Yong-Chun; Su, Lei; Deng, Hui; Lyu, Heng",NA,NA,"The potential of endophytic fungi isolated from cucurbit plants for biocontrol of soilborne fungal diseases of cucumber","MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Su, Lei/AAZ-9766-2021","Su, Lei/0000-0002-8555-3135; Deng, Hui/0000-0002-6517-7937",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0944-5013","","",NA,NA,"",2020,231,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","126369","10.1016/j.micres.2019.126369","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2019.126369","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31733598,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000518491900006","View Full Record in Web of Science",254,"Presence"
"Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease and one of the leading causes of death compared to all health issues. Diabetes drugs can be used to regulate the activity of metabolic enzymes including amylase in diabetic patients. Endophytes are a group of microorganisms that reside in the internal tissue of all higher plants without causing any of the symptoms they live in. Endophytic fungi isolated from plants can serve as a reservoir of secondary metabolites since they can prevent diabetes through alpha-amylase activity. Current research has isolated endophytic fungi from the leaves of Bryophyllum pinnatum and extracts of dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EA), butanol (BuOH) and methanol (MeOH) were carried out to study antioxidant and antidiabetic activities. Twenty-two (BPL1-BPL22) endophytic fungi were isolated from the leaves and their phytochemical presence was examined.Based on the presence of phytoconstituents, 11 endophytic fungi were chosen to analyze their radical scavenging and antidiabetic activities. In a radical scavenging assay, the fungal crude extracts showed a dose-dependent activity. The fungal crude extracts were determined for their antidiabetic potential via alpha-amylase and glucose uptake by yeast cell studies. The maximum alpha inhibitory activity was shown by DCM, EA and MeOH extracts of BPL20 isolate of about 52.03 +/- 0.31, 52.72 +/- 0.81 and 57.67 +/- 0.66 respectively. The glucose uptake by yeast cells by fungal crude extracts was evaluated and MeOH extracts of BPL20 showed 54.27 +/- 0.19% of glucose uptake at 500 mu g/ml concentration. The results revealed the hypoglycemic activity of fungal crude extracts.","J","Settu, S; Arunachalam, S",NA,"","","Settu, Sugashini; Arunachalam, Sathiavelu",NA,NA,"In Vitro anti-diabetic and antioxidant potential of endophytic fungi isolated from Bryophyllum pinnatum L.","RESEARCH JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2278-4535","","",NA,NA,"APR",2023,18,"4",NA,"","",NA,"","","","10.25303/1804rjbt09018","http://dx.doi.org/10.25303/1804rjbt09018","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000975911800002","View Full Record in Web of Science",255,"Presence"
"Vincamine, a monoterpenoid indole alkaloid which had been marketed as nootropic drugs for the treatment of cerebral insufficiencies, is widely found in plants of the Apocynaceae family. Nerium indicum is a plant belonging to the Apocynaceae family. So, the purpose of this research was designed to investigate the vincamine alkaloids producing endophytic fungi from Nerium indicum, Apocynaceae. 11 strains of endophytic fungi, isolated from the stems and roots of the plant, were grouped into 5 genera on the basis of morphological characteristics. All fungal isolates were fermented and their extracts were preliminary screened by Dragendorffs reagent and thin layer chromatography (TLC). One isolated strain CH1, isolated from the stems of Nerium indicum, had the same R-f value (about 0.56) as authentic vincamine. The extracts of strain CH1 were further analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and the results showed that the strain CH1 could produce vincamine and vincamine analogues. The acetylcholinesterase (AchE) inhibitory activity assays using Ellman's method revealed that the metabolites of strain CH1 had significant AchE inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 5.16 mu g/mL. The isolate CH1 was identified as Geomyces sp. based on morphological and molecular identification, and has been deposited in the China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC M 2014676). This study first reported the natural compounds tabersonine and ethyl-vincamine from endophytic fungi CH1, Geomyces sp. In conclusion, the fungal endophytes from Nerium indicum can be used as alternative source for the production of vincamine and vincamine analogues. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH.

"Endophytic fungal communities have been shown to be highly diverse in almost every host plant species analyzed so far. However, the factors shaping their compositions are largely unknown. To elucidate the impact of various factors, 10 independent replicates of DNA extracts from each of 17 surface-sterilized leaf and stem samples were analyzed by pyrosequencing of fungal ITS1 rRNA gene amplicons. Altogether, 154 fungal OTUs (operational taxonomic units), represented by 953,385 sequences, were found in at least 2 samples from Viscum album ssp. austriacum and/or its host Pinus sylvestris. Deviating from earlier, cultivation-based assessments, the communities were dominated by OTUs related to the genus Mortierella and OTUs not assignable to a certain fungal phylum. However, Ascomycota were still the most diverse group in terms of OTU richness and already hypothesized organ and host preferences of certain endophytic Xylariaceae isolated from the Pinus-Viscum-system could be confirmed. Host species and organ type were also the major factors shaping the detected fungal communities. The two plant species clearly differed according to the endophytic fungal communities, but only stems and needles of Pinus were inhabited by significantly different fungal assemblages. Interestingly, only the 1 and 3 year old stem sections differed according to the endophytic fungal community, while differently aged leaves of both plants were indistinguishable in this regard. Size of the organs had no impact on fungal communities in Pinus, but shorter internodes and smaller leaves showed at least a tendency to differ from the corresponding larger organs in Viscum. Fungal communities also differed slightly between the two sampling sites, lying 200 km apart, and between the three sampling campaigns. Because the samples were drawn within 15 days, this finding indicates that seasonal shifts clearly outweigh aging effects in host plant with perennial leaves. The results therefore provide strong evidence against a linear development of the endophytic fungal communities in Pinus sylvestris and Viscum album over the years. The communities seem to establish themselves already in the year the respective organs emerge. Further study is required to clarify whether they predominantly establish anew each year, or if the core community persists throughout subsequent years. The most abundant endophytic OTUs are known from soil and/or dead plant material and are supposed to represent latent decomposers. The study reveals for the first time that host and/or organ preferences of putatively saprotrophic fungi are predominantly responsible for compositional differences in the endophytic fungal communities between host plants and organs. While the analyses are shown to provide rather robust results, the significance of genetic abundance, as revealed by high-throughput sequencing analyses, remains an unsettled issue. This is discussed in detail, as well as the challenges in assigning taxonomic names to OTUs.","J","Persoh, D",NA,"","","Persoh, Derek",NA,NA,"Factors shaping community structure of endophytic fungi-evidence from the Pinus-Viscum-system","FUNGAL DIVERSITY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Persoh, Derek/G-4527-2010","Persoh, Derek/0000-0001-5561-0189",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1560-2745","1878-9129","",NA,NA,"MAY",2013,60,"1",NA,"","SI",NA,"55","69","","10.1007/s13225-013-0225-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13225-013-0225-x","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000320112900007","View Full Record in Web of Science",257,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi are ubiquitous and live within host plants without causing any noticeable symptoms of disease. Little is known about the diversity and function of fungal endophytes in plants, particularly in economically important species. The aim of this study was to determine the identity and diversity of endophytic fungi in leaves, stems and roots of soybean and corn plants and to determine their infection frequencies. Plants were collected in six areas of the provinces of Buenos Aires and Entre Rios (Argentina) two areas were selected for sampling corn and four for soybean. Leaf, stem and root samples were surface-sterilized, cut into 1 cm(2) pieces using a sterile scalpel and aseptically transferred to plates containing potato dextrose agar plus antibiotics. The species were identified using both morphological and molecular data. Fungal endophyte colonization in soybean plants was influenced by tissue type and varieties whereas in corn plants only by tissue type. A greater number of endophytes were isolated from stem tissues than from leaves and root tissues in both species of plants. The most frequently isolated species in all soybean cultivars was Fusarium graminearum and the least isolated one was Scopulariopsis brevicaulis. Furthermore, the most frequently isolated species in corn plants was Aspergillus terreus whereas the least isolated one was Aspergillus flavus. These results could be relevant in the search for endophytic fungi isolates that could be of interest in the control of agricultural pests. (C) 2016 Asociacion Argentina de Microbiologia.

"The symbiont endophytic fungi in tobacco are highly diverse and difficult to classify. Here, we sequenced the genomes of Curvularia trifolii and Leptosphaerulina chartarum isolated from tobacco plants.

Meanwhile, we obtained 68,926 bp and 59,100 bp for their mitochondrial genomes. To more accurately classify C. trifolii and L. chartarum, we extracted seven nuclear genes and 12 mitochondrial genes from these two genomes and their closely related species. The genes were then used for calculation of evolutionary rates and for phylogenetic analysis. Results showed that it was difficult to achieve consistent results using a single gene due to their different evolutionary rates, while the phylogenetic trees obtained by combining datasets showed stable topologies. It is, therefore, more accurate to construct phylogenetic relationships for endophytic fungi based on multi-gene datasets.

"The presence and diversity of endophytic fungi associated with host plants are important not just for host plant growth and defense, but also impact the production of medicinal secondary metabolites. However, the correlation between endophytic fungi and crocin production in Crocus sativus (CS) remains underexplored. Here, we explore the relationship between endophytic fungal diversity and crocin content among different CS tissues and field sites. Specifically, we isolated endophytic fungi from five different field sites (Shanghai, Jiande, Huzhou, Anhui, and Hebei) and five different tissues (corm, scape, leaf, petal, and stigma) and analyzed fungal community diversity, richness, and evenness. We identified a total of 32 endophytic fungal taxa, assigned to 7 orders within 4 classes (Eurotiomycetes, Agaricomycetes, Dothideomycetes, and Sordariomycetes). The most dominant order was Eurotiales, and the most dominant genera were Penicillium and Talaromyces. Species richness tended to be highest in belowgrown tissues, such as corm and scape. Additionally, several fungal taxa were found to be either site- or tissue-specific. Three genera in particular were correlated with crocin content: Penicillium, Sistotrema, and Bjerkandera. Given the fact that endophytic microorganisms can both promote the production of secondary metabolites in host plants and potentially produce secondary metabolites themselves, further study is required to understand the mechanistic relationship between these and other fungal genera and crocin production.","J","Lu, JM; Wang, J; Zhang, JH; Zhu, YC; Qin, LP; Zhu, B",NA,"","","Lu, Jiemiao; Wang, Jie; Zhang, Jiahao; Zhu, Yichun; Qin, Lupin; Zhu, Bo",NA,NA,"Diversity of Culturable Endophytic Fungi in Crocus sativus and Their Correlation with Crocin Content","CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0343-8651","1432-0991","",NA,NA,"FEB",2023,80,"2",NA,"","",NA,"","","73","10.1007/s00284-023-03177-4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-023-03177-4","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36622432,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000911387500002","View Full Record in Web of Science",262,"Presence"

"Blueberries develop a shallow and fibrous root system, with sparse root hairs, normally colonized by mycorrhizal fungi. The presence of endophytic fungi in blueberry roots has been studied mainly in the area of origin of each species. The aims of the present study were to determine the occurrence of endophytic fungi in the roots of southern highbush blueberry (SHB) cultivars, in the three most important blueberry production areas of Argentina, and identify them. Soil samples with blueberry rootlets were obtained and endophytic fungi were isolated from them. Some of them by classical taxonomy identification, and, when this was not possible, PCR amplified material were sequenced (Macrogen laboratory), DNA fragments were analyzed with the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and identified, through GenBank. Blueberry roots were found to be colonized by a large number of fungal genera, which varied greatly among locations and cultivars. Some of the endophytic fungi identified have pathogenic function, others are only plant hosts, and some of them have mycorrhizal function as is the case of genus Oidiodendron where we found O. maius and O. echinulatum. We may conclude that SHB is associated with local ericoid fungi, some of which are mycorrhizal and some dark septate endophytes, which, in most cases, do not match with those found in production regions of their native area, but same of them are important to promote blueberry growth.","J","Pescie, MA; Fradkin, M; Lavado, RS; Chiocchio, VM",NA,"","","Pescie, Maria A.; Fradkin, Maia; Lavado, Raul S.; Chiocchio, Viviana M.",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi in blueberry cultivars, in three production areas of Argentina","PHYSIOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0885-5765","","",NA,NA,"AUG",2021,115,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","101662","10.1016/j.pmpp.2021.101662","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmpp.2021.101662","","MAY 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000713234100007","View Full Record in Web of Science",264,"Presence"

"The endophytic fungus Mucor sp. was isolated from Arabidopsis arenosa inhabiting post mining wastes lands. Its role in plant adaptation to toxic metal enriched environment was evaluated. Plants inoculated with the fungus yielded significantly more biomass. Their growth response was correlated with significant elongation of root hairs, an improved water and P status and a significant upregulation of the expression of genes associated with nutrient uptake. The mechanism of root hair elongation was investigated with auxin and ethylene insensitive Arabidopsis thaliana mutants. The results clearly indicate that the root hair elongation phenotype results from fungi induced alterations in ethylene metabolism. The upregulation of close to 50 genes associated with ethylene biosynthesis and signaling confirm these results. The accumulation of Zn and Fe was lower in endophyte inoculated plants. Additionally, root to shoot translocation of Fe, Cd and Zn was improved. The expression of metal transporters associated with metal influx, efflux and distribution within the plant corresponded with altered metal homeostasis. The results of this study clearly show that the endophytic fungus plays an important role in the adaptation of the non-mycorrhizal A. arenosa to metal toxicity.","J","Rozpadek, P; Domka, A; Wazny, R; Nosek, M; Jedrzejczyk, R; Tokarz, K; Turnau, K",NA,"","","Rozpadek, P.; Domka, A.; Wazny, R.; Nosek, M.; Jedrzejczyk, R.; Tokarz, K.; Turnau, K.",NA,NA,"How does the endophytic fungus Mucor sp improve Arabidopsis arenosa vegetation in the degraded environment of a mine dump?","ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ważny, Rafał/U-4360-2018; Tokarz, Krzysztof/AAJ-4541-2021; Domka, Agnieszka/AAP-6499-2020; Turnau, Katarzyna/ABG-6170-2020; Jędrzejczyk, Roman/HOC-9667-2023; Jędrzejczyk, Roman J./I-5419-2019","Ważny, Rafał/0000-0002-3213-3583; Domka, Agnieszka/0000-0002-7035-5339; Jędrzejczyk, Roman J./0000-0002-1776-1784; Nosek, Michal/0000-0002-6670-9667; Rozpadek, Piotr/0000-0002-9242-2571; Tokarz, Krzysztof/0000-0002-4937-1166; Turnau, Katarzyna/0000-0002-8875-0978",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0098-8472","1873-7307","",NA,NA,"MAR",2018,147,"",NA,"","",NA,"31","42","","10.1016/j.envexpbot.2017.11.009","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2017.11.009","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000424181300004","View Full Record in Web of Science",266,"Presence"
"The endophytic fungal community associated with the ethnomedicinal plant Echinacea purpurea was investigated as well as its potential for providing antifungal compounds against plant pathogenic fungi. A total of 233 endophytic fungal isolates were obtained and classified into 42 different taxa of 16 genera, of which Alternaria alternata, Colletotrichum dematium, and Stagonosporopsis sp. 2 are the most frequent colonizers. The extracts of 29 endophytic fungi displayed activities against important phytopathogenic fungi. Eight antifungal extracts were selected for chemical analysis. Forty fatty acids were identified by gas chromatography-flame-ionization detection (GC-FID) analysis. The compounds (-)-5-methylmellein and (-)(3R)-8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-3,4-dihydroisocoumarin were isolated from Biscogniauxia mediterranea EPU38CA crude extract. (-)-5-Methylmellein showed weak activity against Phomopsis obscurans, P. viticola, and Fusarium oxysporum, and caused growth stimulation of C. fragariae, C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and Botrytis cinerea. (-)-(3R)-8-Hydroxy-6-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-3,4-dihydroisocoumarin appeared slightly more active in the microtiter environment than 5-methylmellein. Our results indicate that E. purpurea lives symbiotically with different endophytic fungi, which are able to produce bioactive fatty acids and aromatic compounds active against important phytopathogenic fungi. The detection of the different fatty acids and aromatic compounds produced by the endophytic community associated with wild E. purpurea suggests that it may have intrinsic mutualistic resistance against phytopathogen attacks in its natural environment.","J","Carvalho, CR; Wedge, DE; Cantrell, CL; Silva-Hughes, AF; Pan, ZQ; Moraes, RM; Madoxx, VL; Rosa, LH",NA,"","","Carvalho, Camila R.; Wedge, David E.; Cantrell, Charles L.; Silva-Hughes, Alice F.; Pan, Zhiqiang; Moraes, Rita M.; Madoxx, Victor L.; Rosa, Luiz H.",NA,NA,"Molecular Phylogeny, Diversity, and Bioprospecting of Endophytic Fungi Associated with wild Ethnomedicinal North American Plant Echinacea purpurea (Asteraceae)","CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Ferreira-Silva, Alice/0000-0002-1927-3194",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1612-1872","1612-1880","",NA,NA,"JUL",2016,13,"7",NA,"","",NA,"918","930","","10.1002/cbdv.201500299","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cbdv.201500299","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27273012,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000383393100014","View Full Record in Web of Science",267,"Presence"
"Huperzine A (HupA), a natural Lycopodium alkaloid derived from Huperzia serrata (Thunb. ex Murray) Trev. plants, is a highly active acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and a key compound used for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, HupA has been reported in various endophytic fungi isolated from H. serrata. In the present study, 153 endophytic fungi were isolated from healthy tissues of H. serrata collected from natural populations in Lam Dong province of Central Vietnam. The endophytic fungi were identified based on morphological characteristics and Internal Transcribed Spacer sequences. Among them, 34 strains were classified into seven genera belonging to Ascomycota, including Alternaria, Fusarium, Trichoderma, Penicillium, Paecilomyces, and Phoma, and eight strains belonging to the genus Mucor (Zygomycota). The other strains remained unidentified. According to the results of thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, only one of the 153 strains, Penicillium sp. LDL4.4, could produce HupA, with a yield 1.38 mg l(-1) (168.9 mu g g(-1) dried mycelium) when cultured in potato dextrose broth, which was considerably higher than that of other reported endophytic fungi. Such a fungus is a promising candidate and alternative to presently available HupA production techniques for treating AD and preventing further memory decline.","J","Le, TTM; Hoang, ATH; Le, TTB; Vo, TTB; Quyen, DV; Chu, HH",NA,"","","Thanh Thi Minh Le; Anh Thi Hong Hoang; Thuy Thi Bich Le; Thuy Thi Bich Vo; Dong Van Quyen; Ha Hoang Chu",NA,NA,"Isolation of endophytic fungi and screening of Huperzine A-producing fungus from Huperzia serrata in Vietnam","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Quyen, Dong Van/0000-0003-1002-7517; CHU, HOANG HA/0000-0002-1103-5845",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2045-2322","","",NA,NA,"NOV 6",2019,9,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","16152","10.1038/s41598-019-52481-2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-52481-2","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31695105,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000494636900005","View Full Record in Web of Science",268,"Presence"
"Background: Endophytic fungi that live asymptomatically inside the plant tissues have novel bioactive metabolites exhibiting a variety of biological activities, especially against cancer. Cordia dichotoma G. Forst. play a significant role in traditional medicines and therapeutics. Leaves and bark have been used as anti-inflammatory and anticancer agents. Objectives: Isolation, screening, and in silico toxicity evaluation of camptothecin (CPT) from the endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis microspora MH458929. Materials and Methods: Endophytic fungus was isolated from leaves of C. dichotoma collected from Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve forest (STRF), Tamil Nadu. The wild strain was identified by 18S rDNA sequencing. Modified potato dextrose broth was used as a screening medium for the presence of CPT. CPT was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Compounds identified by ESI-MS from fungal extract were further studied for their in silico toxicity study against Daphnia magna, Tetrahymena pyriformis, Pimephales promelas, and Rattus sp. Bioaccumulation factors, developmental toxicity, and mutagenicity were studied by the quantitative structure-activity relationship model - Toxicity Estimation Software Tool. Results: Endophytic fungus P. microspora produced a maximum yield of 0.691 mg/L of CPT. CPT derivatives were identified at m/z of 349.10, 363.08, and 389.41 through ESI-MS analysis. In silico toxicity study revealed that compounds were of Category D and hence considered nontoxic to higher organisms. However, compounds showed high toxicity for lower organisms, with toxicity order D. magna > T. pyriformis > P. promelas > rat. Conclusion: The present study is the first report to screen, isolate, and analyze the CPT's in silico toxicity and its derivatives from endophytic fungus P. microspora from STRF. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are recommended to utilize CPT and its derivatives in pharmaceuticals.","J","Dhakshinamoorthy, M; Packiam, KK",NA,"","","Dhakshinamoorthy, Madhankumar; Packiam, Kannan Kilavan",NA,NA,"Camptothecin: An Anticancer Drug from Pestalotiopsis microspora Mh458929-An Endophytic Fungus Isolated from an Ethnopharmacologically Important Medicinal Plant Cordia dichotoma G.

"The mycota and decomposing potential of endophytic fungi associated with Acer truncatum, a common tree in northern China, were investigated. The colonization rate of endophytic fungi was significantly higher in twigs (77%) than in leaves (11%). However, there was no significant difference in the colonization rates of endophytic fungi between lamina (9%) and midrib (14%) tissues. A total of 58 endophytic taxa were recovered using two isolation methods and these were identified based on morphology and ITS sequence data. High numbers of leaf endophytes were obtained in the method to determine decomposition of leaves by the natural endophyte community (35 taxa) as compared to disk fragment methodology (9 taxa). The weight loss in A. truncatum leaves decomposed by endophyte communities increased with incubation time; the weight loss was significantly higher at 20 weeks than at 3 and 8 weeks. Both common and rare endophytic taxa produced extracellular enzymes in vitro and showed different leaf decay abilities. Our results indicated that the composition and diversity of endophytic fungi obtained differed using two isolation methods.

"Endophytic fungi play an important role in plant growth. The composition and structure of endophytes vary in different plant tissues, which are specific habitats for endophyte colonization. To analyze the diversity and structural composition of endophytic fungi from toothed clubmoss (Huperzia serrata) that was artificially cultivated for 3 years, we investigated endophytic fungi from the roots, stems and leaves using comparative sequence analysis of the ITS2 region of the fungal rRNA genes sequenced with high-throughput sequencing technology. Seven fungal phyla were identified, and fungal diversity and structure varied across different tissues, with the most distinctive community features found in the roots. A total of 555 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected, and 198 were common to all samples, and 43, 16, 16 OTUs were unique to the root, stem, leaf samples, respectively. Taxonomic classification showed that Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were dominant phyla, and Cladosporium, Oidiodendron, Phyllosticta, Sebacina and Ilyonectria were dominant genera. The relative abundance heat map at the genus level suggested that H. serrata had characteristic endophytic fungal microbiomes.

"Aloe dhufarensis Lavranos is an important medicinal plant, however, the endophytic microorganisms associated with this plant and their antagonistic activities are not known. In this study, endophytic fungi and bacteria were isolated from the leaf tissues of A. dhufarensis and their antagonistic activity against the plant pathogens Fusarium sp. and Cladosporium sp. were evaluated using a dual culture assay. A total of 3 fungal endophytes and 12 bacterial endophytes were isolated from the leaf tissue segments of A. dhufarensis. Among them, two endophytic fungal isolates designated as SQUCC-F2-2 and SQUCC-F3-1 exhibited inhibitory activity against the phytopathogenic fungi tested. In addition, scanning electron microscopy analysis showed that they induced shriveling, pit formation and disintegration of the hyphae of the phytopathogenic fungi. These two endophytic fungal isolates were identified as Sarocladium kiliense (SQUCC-F2-2) and Penicillium oxalicum (SQUCC-F3-1) on the basis of nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Analysis of the metabolites produced by these endophytes revealed the presence of fatty acids, fatty acid methyl esters, furfuryl alcohol, 1,2-diols and amide, which have been identified in the literature as antimicrobial compounds. P. oxalicum produced 7 compounds, of which 2-Furanmethanol, Dodecanoic acid and Tetradecanoic acid were dominant. S. kiliense produced 8 compounds with 2,3-Butanediol as the main constituent.

"Background Fungal endophytes produce a variety of secondary metabolites which can be explored for herbicidal activities. Parthenium is a very aggressive and fast-spreading weed in Pakistan. The endophytes of Parthenium made it superior over other weeds. Those endophytes can be isolated, identified, and incorporated in sustainable agriculture to biologically control other severe weeds. Main body The present study was conducted to isolate and identify the endophytic fungi from the roots of Parthenium hysterophorus (Family: Asteraceae) and evaluate their cultural filtrate against the growth of three selected weed species, i.e., Chenopodium album, Avena fatua, and Convolvulus arvensis. Moreover, pot experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of cultural filtrates of these endophytic fungi against the germination, growth, and other physiological parameters (cellular contents, respiration, and cellular leakage) of the abovementioned three weed species. Three endophytic fungi, i.e., Alternaria, Aspergillus, and Drechslera spp., were isolated from the roots of P. hysterophorus. Among these endophytic fungi, cultural (hyphal) filtrate of Alternaria spp. exhibited the strongest phytotoxic effect, followed by Drechslera spp. and Aspergillus spp. against the selected weeds. Moreover, all the three endophytic fungi showed significant reduction in the germination as well as other physiological parameters of the weed species. Conclusion It is concluded that the utilization of endophytic fungi could be a non-chemical, effective, ecofriendly, and low-cost biological control method that can be used for the biomanagement of fast-spreading and aggressive weeds.","J","Ahmad, Y; Ahmad, MN; Zia, A; Alam, SS; Khan, RAA; Riaz, M",NA,"","","Ahmad, Yaseen; Ahmad, Muhammad Nauman; Zia, Afia; Alam, Syed Sartaj; Khan, Raja Asad Ali; Riaz, Muhammad",NA,NA,"Biocontrol of economically important weed species through endophytic fungi isolated from Parthenium hysterophorus (Family: Asteraceae)","EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Khan, Raja Asad Ali/AAI-8285-2020; Alam, Syed Sartaj/AAK-4628-2021","Khan, Raja Asad Ali/0000-0001-5767-3466; ahmad, yaseen/0000-0003-1106-5494",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1110-1768","2536-9342","",NA,NA,"NOV 19",2020,30,"1",NA,"","",NA,"","","138","10.1186/s41938-020-00339-5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41938-020-00339-5","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000595117200001","View Full Record in Web of Science",274,"Presence"

"Tujia is a national minority, inhabiting in the mountainous Wuling area in China. Since 1978, Tujia medicine has been studied, summarized and developed, leading to numerous achievements by Chinese researchers, such as the publishing of approximately 30 monographs of Tujia medicine. These publications are focused on summarizing and improving the theory of Tujia medicine and developing clinical therapies from this system of medicine. The shortage of natural medicinal plants used in Tujia medicine has created the need to discover new resources to replace them and protect endangered natural plant species. Endophytic fungi are one of the conservation options, are considered a source of new bioactive natural products, and are a renewable and inexhaustible source of new drugs and agrochemicals. This review summarizes 260 compounds from endophytic fungi that have been previously isolated from the medicinal plants of Tujia.

"Success of targeted cancer treatment modalities has generated an ambience of plausible cure for cancer. However, cancer remains to be the major cause of mortality across the globe. The emergence of chemoresistance, relapse after treatment and associated adverse effects has posed challenges to the present therapeutic regimes. Thus, investigating new therapeutic agents of natural origin and delineating the underlying mechanism of action is necessary. Since ages and still in continuum, the phytochemicals have been the prime source of identifying bioactive agents against cancer. They have been exploited for isolating targeted specific compounds to modulate the key regulating signaling pathways of cancer pathogenesis and progression. Capsaicin (alkaloid compound in chilli), catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (phytochemicals in green tea), lutein (carotenoid found in yellow fruits), Garcinol (phenolic compound present in kokum tree) and many other naturally available compounds are also very valuable to develop the drugs to treat the cancer. An alternate repository of similar chemical diversity exists in the form of endophytic fungi inhabiting the medicinal plants. There is a high diversity of plant associated endophytic fungi in nature which are potent producers of anti-cancer compounds and offers even stronger hope for the discovery of an efficient anti-cancer drug. These fungi provide various bioactive molecules, such as terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, phenolic compounds, quinines, steroids etc. exhibiting anti-cancerous property. The review discusses the relevance of phytochemicals in chemoprevention and as modulators of miRNA. The perspective advocates the imperative role of anti-cancerous secondary metabolites containing repository of endophytic fungi, as an alternative route of drug discovery.","J","Tyagi, G; Kapoor, N; Chandra, G; Gambhir, L",NA,"","","Tyagi, Garima; Kapoor, Neha; Chandra, Girish; Gambhir, Lokesh",NA,NA,"Cure lies in nature: medicinal plants and endophytic fungi in curbing cancer","3 BIOTECH","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gambhir, Dr Lokesh/AAR-6374-2020; Kapoor, Dr. Neha/JMR-0589-2023","Gambhir, Dr Lokesh/0000-0003-3069-4456; Kapoor, Dr. Neha/0000-0002-9574-7056",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2190-572X","2190-5738","",NA,NA,"JUN",2021,11,"6",NA,"","",NA,"","","263","10.1007/s13205-021-02803-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-021-02803-x","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33996375,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000761700400005","View Full Record in Web of Science",277,"Review"
"Homoharringtonine (HHT), a natural plant alkaloid derived from Cephalotaxus, has demonstrated to have a broad antitumor activity and efficacy in treating human chronic myeloid leukemia. An alternative source is required to substitute for the slow-growing and scarce Cephalotaxus to meet the increasing demand of the drug market. The objective of this study was to screen HHTproducing endophytic fungi from Cephalotaxus hainanensis Li. By screening 213 fungal isolates obtained from the bark parts of Cephalotaxus hainanensis Li, one isolate was found to be capable of biosynthesizing HHT. The fungus was identified as Alternaria tenuissana by morphological characteristics and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analysis and was named as CH1307. HHT obtained from CH1307 was analyzed through the HPLC and LC MS/MS and NMR spectroscopy. The extract of the fermentation broth of CH1307 showed antiproliferative activities against K562 (chronic myelocytic leukemia), NB4 (acute promyelocytic leukemia), and HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia) human cancer cell lines with IC50 values of 67.25 +/- 4.26, 65.02 +/- 4.75, and 99.23 +/- 4.26 mu g/mL, respectively.

"Pennisetum sinese is a good forage grass with high biomass production and crude proteins. However, little is known about the endophytic fungi diversity of P. sinese, which might play an important role in the plant's growth and biomass production. Here, we used high throughput sequencing of the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequences based on primers ITS5-1737 and ITS2-2043R to investigate the endophytic fungi diversity of P. sinese roots at the maturity stage, as collected from four provinces (Shaanxi province, SX; Fujian province, FJ; the Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous prefecture, XJ and Inner Mongolia, including sand (NS) and saline-alkali land (NY), China). The ITS sequences were processed using QIIME and R software. A total of 374,875 effective tags were obtained, and 708 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were yielded with 97% identity in the five samples. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the two dominant phyla in the five samples, and the genera Khuskia and Heydenia were the most abundant in the FJ and XJ samples, respectively, while the most abundant tags in the other three samples could not be annotated at the genus level. In addition, our study revealed that the FJ sample possessed the highest OTU numbers (242) and the NS sample had the lowest (86). Moreover, only 22 OTUs were present in all samples simultaneously. The beta diversity analysis suggested a division of two endophytic fungi groups: the FJ sample from the south of China and the other four samples from north or northwest China. Correlation analysis between the environmental factors and endophytic fungi at the class level revealed that Sordariomycetes and Pucciniomycetes had extremely significant positive correlations with the total carbon, annual average precipitation, and annual average temperature, while Leotiomycetes showed an extremely significant negative correlation with quick acting potassium. The results revealed significant differences in the root endophytic fungi diversity of P. sinese in different provinces and might be useful for growth promotion and biomass production in the future.","J","Deng, ZS; Liu, XD; Zhang, BC; Jiao, S; Qi, XY; Sun, ZH; He, XL; Liu, YZ; Li, J; Chen, KK; Lin, ZX; Jiang, YY",NA,"","","Deng, Zhen-Shan; Liu, Xiao-Dong; Zhang, Bao-Cheng; Jiao, Shuo; Qi, Xiang-Ying; Sun, Zhi-Hong; He, Xiao-Long; Liu, Yu-Zhen; Li, Jing; Chen, Kai-Kai; Lin, Zhan-Xi; Jiang, Ying-Ying",NA,NA,"The Root Endophytic Fungi Community Structure of Pennisetum sinese from Four Representative Provinces in China","MICROORGANISMS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"He, Xiaolong/GLU-2516-2022","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2076-2607","",NA,NA,"SEP",2019,7,"9",NA,"","",NA,"","","332","10.3390/microorganisms7090332","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms7090332","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31505744,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000489131300059","View Full Record in Web of Science",279,"Presence"
"Endophytes are symptomless organisms thriving within the living host tissues. Some endophytic fungi have been shown to be producing the same compounds produced by their hosts, e.g., taxol produced by Pestalotiopsis microspora isolated from Taxus wallichiana. Hence, there has been lot of interest to screen the secondary metabolites of endophytic fungi. In recent times the focus on endophytic fungi and the secondary metabolites they produce has shifted to marine environments. Unlike terrestrial environments where more research has been conducted on secondary metabolites from living plant substrata, the secondary metabolites produced by endophytic fungi isolated from marine environments are equally from macroalgae (seaweeds) and sponges in addition to mangrove and different shoreline plant substrata. Many promising secondary metabolites that have therapeutic potential including in antimicrobial, antiviral, antimalarial, and anticancer applications have been reported from endophytic fungi isolated from seaweeds, sponges, and plants from maritime environments. For example, the compound 3-O-methylfunicone isolated from Talaromyces sp., in mangrove habitat, has shown antifungal, antitumor, and lipid-lowering properties and required beyond academic research wherein pharmaceutical industry needs to take it further. A Cladosporium L037 species from the brown alga Actinotrichia fragilis, collected off Seragaki Beach at Okinawa Island, Japan, produced two 12-membered macrolides, namely, sporiolides A and B. Both these metabolites exhibited potent cytotoxicity against murine lymphoma L1210 cells with IC50 values of 0.37 and 3.1 um, respectively. A cyclic tetrapeptide compound produced by Petriella sp., an endophyte of the sponge Suberites domuncula, showed cytotoxicity against murine L5178Y lymphoma cells at an ED50 value of < 0.1 mu g/ml. Th e present chapter updates and consolidates the information available on the secondary metabolites produced by endophytic fungi isolated from marine environments.","S","Rashmi, M; Kushveer, JS; Sarma, VV",NA,"Jha, S","","Rashmi, Mishra; Kushveer, J.

Total fungal frequency (TFF) and frequency of Gnomonia cerastis were lowest on hosts resembling Q. grisea, and increased linearly towards those resembling Q. gambelii. In contrast, Coccochorella quercicola was most frequently isolated from Q. grisea-like hosts and decreased in frequency across hybrids towards Q. gambelii. Frequency of G. cerastis and TFF covaried with Phyllonorycter density across the hybrid zone, but direct effects of endophytes on Phyllonorycter density were not detected. Associations between endophytes and unexplained mortality of Phyllonorycter varied according to endophyte species and stage of Phyllonorycter development. In the sap-feeding stage, unexplained mortality was negatively associated with TFF and frequencies of Hormonema sp. and Preussia funiculata; whereas, in the tissue-feeding stage, unexplained Phyllonorycter mortality was positively associated with G. cerastis frequency.

"There are many problems that result from the use of a large number of chemical pesticides to control plant diseases, including pathogenic bacteria resistance, environmental contamination, and human health effects. Recently, endophytic fungi have become a significant source of bioactive fungicide products and an invaluable resource for excavating microbial pesticides. In this study, endophytic fungi with biocontrol potential were isolated and screened from Mikania micrantha leaves, stems, and roots. Fifty endophytic fungi were isolated and their antagonistic activity was studied in vitro using the confrontation culture method. The J2-3 strains from stems exhibit broad-spectrum and high activity. The strain's biological characteristics were determined by various culture conditions, and it was identified as Fusarium proliferatum by both morphological and ITS sequence analysis. Biological characteristics of the J2-3 strain were also tested. The optimum temperature for mycelium growth and sporulation was 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C, respectively. For mycelium growth, starch was the optimum carbon source, and peptone was the optimum nitrogen source for sucrose, mycelium growth, and sporulation. Mycelium growth was killed by a temperature of 60 degrees C, and sporulation was killed by a temperature of 55 degrees C. The light aided mycelium growth, and the light alternated between light and dark cycles for sporulation. Further, pot experiments were conducted to determine the antagonistic and viable effects of highly antagonistic strains on cucumber. The spore suspension's final control efficacy on cucumber wilt disease was up to 62.79% and it also promoted cucumber growth significantly.

"Background: Drug resistance in bacteria has become a global concern and the search for new antibacterial agents is urgent and ongoing. Endophytes provide an abundant reservoir of bioactive metabolites for medicinal exploitation, and an increasing number of novel compounds are being isolated from endophytic fungi. Ophiopogon japonicus, containing compounds with antibacterial activity, is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant used for eliminating phlegm, relieving coughs, latent heat in the lungs, and alleviating diabetes mellitus. We investigated the antimicrobial activities of 30 strains of O. japonicus. Methods: Fungal endophytes were isolated from roots and stems of O. japonicus collected from Chongqing City, southwestern China. Mycelial extracts (MC) and fermentation broth (FB) were tested for antimicrobial activity using peptide deformylase (PDF) inhibition fluorescence assays and MTT cell proliferation assays. Results: A total of 30 endophytic strains were isolated from O. japonicus; 22 from roots and eight from stems. 53.33% of the mycelial extracts (MC) and 33.33% of the fermentation broths (FB) displayed potent inhibition of PDF. 80% of MC and 33.33% of FB significantly inhibited Staphylococcus aureus. 70% of MC and 36.67% of FB showed strong activities against Cryptococcus neoformans.

"Aim To obtain promising immunosuppressants from endophytic fungus. Methods and Results The endophytic fungus Mycosphaerella nawae (ZJLQ129) was isolated from the plant Smilax china L. and its secondary metabolites extracted and fractionated through column chromatography. The metabolites were further modified by a derivatization reaction with ammonium hydroxide. After isolation and derivatization, a new dibenzofuran named as (+)isomycousnine enamine (iME) was obtained. The structures of the derivatives were determined based on chemical evidences and extensive spectroscopic methods including 2D-NMR, DEPT and HRESI-MS spectra. The immune activities of iME were first evaluated on the proliferation and cytokines (IL-2 and IFN-gamma) production of T and B cells by using MTT and ELISA methods respectively. Then, its effects on the proliferation of T-cell subsets (CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells), as well as CD25 and CD69 expressions were also determined by flow cytometry. Finally, by using Cytometric Bead Array (CBA), the impacts of iME on the secretion of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines from purified CD4(+) T cells were assayed. The results showed that iME not only selectively suppressed the immune responses of T cells, but also preferentially inhibited the activation and proliferation of CD4(+) T cells. Conclusion A novel dibenzofuran derived from endophytic fungus Mycosphaerella nawae preferentially inhibits CD4(+) T-cell activation and proliferation. Significance and Impact of the Study This work obtained iME, a new dibenzofuran derived from endophytic fungus. iME has the capacity to inhibit CD4(+) T-cell activation and therefore is a novel potential immunosuppressant for development in the future.","J","Wang, LW; Li, J; Gao, LX; Chen, FY",NA,"","","Wang, Li-Wei; Li, Jie; Gao, Le-Xin; Chen, Feng-Yang",NA,NA,"A novel dibenzofuran from endophytic fungus Mycosphaerella nawae preferentially inhibits CD4+ T cell activation and proliferation","JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","chen, fengyang/0000-0003-4490-8443; wang, liwei/0000-0003-2112-0135",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1364-5072","1365-2672","",NA,NA,"DEC",2022,133,"6",NA,"","",NA,"3502","3511","","10.1111/jam.15782","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.15782","","AUG 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35973736,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000843220100001","View Full Record in Web of Science",286,"Presence"
"Gentiana scabra Bge. (gentian) is a Chinese medicinal plant. Endophytic fungi from the roots of gentian were isolated and cross-growth period inoculation was performed to study the roles of three Trichoderma spp. strains (F1, F2, and F9) in their original host plant. In treatments inoculated with F1, F2, and F9, gentiopicroside content increased 33.6, 23.7 and 13% than that in the control. Strains F1, F2, and F9 could also improve polysaccharide content by more than 6.6, 18.7 and 30% compared to the control. The incidence of spot blight in gentian inoculated with F1, F2, and F9 decreased by 31.2, 26.7 and 8.5%. Inconsistent changes in the activity of the three enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and peroxidase) were observed when the plants were attacked by pathogens or inoculated with fungi. High enzymatic activity did not reflect mild disease. Cross-growth period inoculation, which takes into account the original living environment (gentian plant as substrate and different microorganisms as symbionts) of endophytic fungi, provides a new idea for studying effects of endophytes on their original hosts. This is the first research about the role of endophytic fungi in Gentiana scabra bge. in vivo.","J","Wang, DM; Wang, H; Li, J; Zhang, W; Pan, YN; Liu, XQ",NA,"","","Wang, Dongmei; Wang, Huan; Li, Jing; Zhang, Wei; Pan, Yingni; Liu, Xiaoqiu",NA,NA,"Investigating the Role of Endophytic Fungi in Gentiana scabra bge. by Cross-Growth Period Inoculation","INDIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"wang, qiang/IZW-1751-2023","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0046-8991","0973-7715","",NA,NA,"SEP",2018,58,"3",NA,"","",NA,"319","325","","10.1007/s12088-018-0725-1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12088-018-0725-1","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30013276,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000436819400008","View Full Record in Web of Science",287,"Presence"
"In the light of the fast growing several applications of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) in different industrial and agricultural sectors, this paper was conducted to explore the suitability of endophytic fungi as nano-factories for SeNPs. Thus, 75 fungal isolates were recovered from plant tissues and tested for their efficacy to biosynthesize SeNPs. Four promising strains were found able to synthesis SeNPs with different characteristics and identified. These strains were Aspergillus quadrilineatus isolated from the twigs of Ricinus communis, Aspergillus ochraceus isolated from the leaves of Ricinus communis, Aspergillus terreus isolated from the twigs of Azadirachta indica, and Fusarium equiseti isolated from the twigs of Hibiscus rose-sinensis. The synthesized SeNPs were characterized by several techniques viz., UV-Vis, X-ray diffraction, Dynamic light scattering analyses, High resolution transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, to study their crystalline structure, particle sized distribution, and morphology. Furthermore, the in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities were evaluated. SeNPs synthesized by the four strains showed potent antifungal and antibacterial potentials against different human and phyto- pathogens. Moreover, SeNPs synthesized by the respective strains showed promising antioxidant power with IC50 values of 198.32, 151.23, 100.31, and 91.52 mu g mL(- 1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the use of endophytic fungi for SeNPs' biosynthesis.

"To examine the symbiotic relationship between Dendrobium huoshanense and its endophytic fungi, a total of 168 endophytic fungi were isolated and classified into 18 genera and 36 species via using pure culture and techniques of molecular biology. Among them, Stagonosporopsis oculihominis, Alternaria eichhorniae, Phyllosticta aristolochiicola, Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium lactis were the dominant genera. Further, the secondary metabolites produced by the dominant genera were screened for antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. The secondary metabolites of Stagonosporopsis oculihominis showed good inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus and the release of nitric oxide (NO). Three benzene ring derivatives were also identified using chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques, including (Z)-1- hydroxy-4-(2-nitroethenyl)-benzene (1), p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (2) and p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3).

Endophytic fungi were isolated from four different tea plant tissues (bark, xylem, old leaves, new leaves) collected from pesticide-treated and untreated plots. In pesticide-treated plot, the acaricides, fungicides, and insecticides are typically applied 3 times each year. The infection rate was slightly lower in the pesticide-treated plot, but the difference between plots was not statistically significant. Colletotrichum camelliae, Phyllosticta capitalensis, and Pleosporales sp. were common endophytes in both plots. Among a total of 41 fungal species, only 21 were considered common endophytes. Colletotrichum pseudomajus was the predominant endophyte in the bark tissue in the untreated plot, whereas C. camelliae was predominant in the pesticide-treated plot. Paraphaeosphaeria neglecta and Phoma bellendis were predominant in the xylem tissues of samples from the untreated and treated plots, respectively. Colletotrichum camelliae was the most commonly found species in leaf tissues in both plots, but the colonization frequency was significantly lower in the pesticide-treated plot.

The ethyl acetate extract of A.brassicicola was subjected to column chromatography. Among the different fractions, the fraction 7 showed positive to taxol, which was further confirmed by UV absorption, HPLC, FTIR spectra and LC-ESI-MS by comparing with the authentic taxol (Paclitaxel). The peaks of fraction 7 obtained by UV spectroscopy, FTIR and HPLC analysis were quite similar to that of standard taxol confirming the presence of taxol. A parent ion peak of m/z 854.95 was observed in the LC-ESI-MS spectrum which was similar to paclitaxel with reported m/z of 854 [M+H](+) ion.

The present study is the first research on endophytic fungi associated with C. mannii collected in Vietnam and their potent biological activities. A total of 18 endophytic fungi were isolated; according to the results of morphological and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analyses, they belonged to six genera: Penicillium, Fusarium, Aspergillus, Diaporthe, Megasporoporia, and Trichoderma. Among these strains, the ethyl acetate extracts of Penicillium citrinum WDF8 and Fusarium perseae WDF12 showed remarkable antibacterial activity against at least 5 tested bacteria. Of note, only the WDF12 extract displayed potential cytotoxicity against A549 and MCF7 cancer cell lines with IC50 values at 13.4 +/- 0.9 and 17.8 +/- 2 mu g/mL, respectively. Further cytotoxicity evaluation led to the identification of 10-deacetylbaccatin III-10-O-acetyl transferase (dbat) gene essential for the biosynthesis of the anti-cancer drug paclitaxel in the fungal strain WDF8. Both extracts also showed strong antioxidant activity against DPPH, hydroxyl, and superoxide anion radicals, attributed to a high level of polyphenols and flavonoids present.

"Endophytes are microorganisms that colonize the tissues of live host plants usually showing no apparent symptoms. These endophytes, both bacteria and fungus, can produce a variety of secondary metabolites having a wide range of essential properties. Thus, they can be used for various medicinal, environmental and agronomic purposes. Argemone mexicana, a plant of the family Papaveraceae is widespread across India, and blooms in the month of March. The study was carried out to isolate endophytic fungus living in the shoot and root areas of A. mexicana from Northeast India, and to identify and characterize these endophytes. A total of 20 types of fungal species were isolated from both the root and shoot parts of the plant. Endophytes were identified by 18SrDNA sequencing using ITS1 and ITS4 primers. Genomic DNA was isolated using Cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide method of the endophytes. The endophytic fungi were identified as belonging to Aspergillus and Penicillium sps by using sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region and Basic local alignment search tool. Aspergillus oryzaem A. niger, and A. flavus showed 100% relative abundance in root and shoot.

"Growing research suggests that endophytic fungi deeply affect plant physiology, development, and metabolism, which has become an indispensable subject in plant research. However, the micromolecular mechanisms remain vague due to the complexity of the interactions. This article summarizes the latest progress in the mechanism studies of the symbiotic relationships between endophytic fungi and plants. We address the aspects from signal generation, plant defense, to fungal coping strategies to establish the balanced constraint relationships between fungi and their hosts that finally form a community of shared future. These processes do not occur in isolation but in synergy. Both endophytic fungi and their host plants contribute to establishing the stable symbiosis. New insights have been provided into a deeper understanding of the occurrence of species interactions and their applications to solving practical problems.","J","Ji, X; Xia, Y; Zhang, H; Cui, JL",NA,"","","Ji, Xin; Xia, Ye; Zhang, Hui; Cui, Jin-Long",NA,NA,"The microscopic mechanism between endophytic fungi and host plants: From recognition to building stable mutually beneficial relationships","MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0944-5013","1618-0623","",NA,NA,"AUG",2022,261,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","127056","10.1016/j.micres.2022.127056","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2022.127056","","MAY 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35552099,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000805664200002","View Full Record in Web of Science",301,"Review"
"This study evaluated the antibacterial efficacy of methanolic extracts of isolated endophytic fungi from stem barks and leaves of Alstonia boonei De Wild and Greenwayodendron suaveolens (Engl. and Diels) Verdc. subsp. Suaveolens against Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 43816, Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, responsible for causing pneumonia. The endophytic fungi were isolated and characterized in the Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA), Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA), and Czapek Dox Agar (CDA) media. The fungi and their methanolic extracts were tested for in vitro antibacterial potential by antagonistic assay for endophytic fungi against bacterial pathogens and microdilution method. The phytochemical screening of extracts was carried out according to the colorimetric and precipitation methods to reveal the presence of secondary metabolites. The results showed that 24 macroscopically and microscopically distinct endophytic fungi were isolated, identified, and stored. These endophytic fungi possessed antibacterial activity against the selected bacterial strains with inhibition zones ranging from 7.00 to 25.00 mm. The endophytic fungi GS(15) and AB(24) have presented the inhibitions zones of 20.33mm and 25.00 mm, respectively, and these were better than the ones obtained for Levofloxacin((R)). The endophytes with inhibition zones greater than 10mm were used for extraction of their secondary metabolites. The endophytic fungi extracts showed antibacterial activity with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 6.25 Chi 10(-4) to 2 Chi 10(-2) g/L and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) ranging from 2.5 Chi 10(-3) to 2 Chi 10(-2) g/L. The endophytic fungi GS(15) extract was the most effective extract; it showed bactericidal effects on the tested bacterial strains. The phytochemical screening of the extracts revealed the presence of secondary metabolites classes, responsible for causing the obtained antibacterial activity. Thus, the endophytic fungi methanolic extracts from A. boonei and G. suaveolens have the potential to inhibit the growth of bacteria responsible for nosocomial pneumonia.","J","Demeni, PCE; Betote, PHD; Kom, CW; Tchamgoue, EN; Moni, EDN; Maniepi, JSF; Agbor, GA; Nyegue, MA",NA,"","","Demeni, Paola Cynthia Emoh; Betote, Patrick Herve Diboue; Kom, Christelle Wayoue; Tchamgoue, Eric Ngalani; Moni, Esther Del Florence Ndedi; Maniepi, Jacqueline Saurelle Foumane; Agbor, Gabriel A.; Nyegue, Maximilienne Ascension",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungi from Alstonia boonei De Wild and Greenwayodendron suaveolens (Engl. and Diels) Verdc. subsp.

"DNA isolated and amplified from higher plants may originate from symbiotic microbes occupying plant tissues. A recent report on the phylogeny of Picea contained sequence data that upon later analysis proved to originate from filamentous ascomycetes. Isolates of endophytic fungi from Picea foliage collected from the same location as the original samples were examined to identify the source of the contaminating DNA. The ITS region of isolates was screened by Southern blotting using an oligonucleotide probe homologous to a unique portion of the reported 'spruce' sequences. This study identifies a DNA sequence originally attributed to Picea engelmannii (Engelmann spruce) as Hormonema dematioides, a ubiquitous foliar endophyte of conifers. Infections of plants by endophytic fungi are common and their presence is not revealed by external symptoms.

"The present study proposes the use of endophytic fungi for mercury bioremediation in in vitro and host-associated systems. We examined mercury resistance in 32 strains of endophytic fungi grown in culture medium supplemented with toxic metal concentrations. The residual mercury concentrations were quantified after mycelial growth. Aspergillus sp. A31, Curvularia geniculata P1, Lindgomycetaceae P87, and Westerdykella sp. P71 were selected and further tested for mercury bioremediation and bioaccumulation in vitro, as well as for growth promotion of Aeschynomene fluminensis and Zea mays in the presence or absence of the metal. Aspergillus sp. A31, C. geniculata P1, Lindgomycetaceae P87 and Westerdykella sp. P71 removed up to 100% of mercury from the culture medium in a species-dependent manner and they promoted A. fluminensis and Z. mays growth in substrates containing mercury or not (Dunnett's test, p < 0.05). Lindgomycetaceae P87 and C geniculata P1 are dark septate endophytic fungi that endophytically colonize root cells of their host plants. The increase of host biomass correlated with the reduction of soil mercury concentration due to the metal bioaccumulation in host tissues and its possible volatilization. The soil mercury concentration was decreased by 7.69% and 57.14% in A. fluminensis plants inoculated with Lindgomycetaceae P87 + Aspergillus sp. A31 and Lindgomycetaceae P87, respectively (Dunnet's test, p < 0.05). The resistance mechanisms of mercury volatilization and bioaccumulation in plant tissues mediated by these endophytic fungi can contribute to bioremediation programs. The biochemical and genetic mechanisms involved in bioaccumulation and volatilization need to be elucidated in the future. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

"Objective(s): Salvia abrotanoides is considered as a new source of tanshinone-producing plants in Iran. Symbiosis of endophytic fungi with their host plants is an effective tool to promote the growth and secondary metabolism of medicinal herbs. Therefore, using endophytic fungi as a biotic elicitor is a proper solution to increase the yield of plant products. Materials and Methods: In this study, some endophytic fungi were first isolated from the root of S. abrotanoides, then two of them (Penicillium canescens and Talaromyces sp.) were co-cultivated with the sterile seedling of S. abrotanoides in pot culture. After proving the colonization of these fungi in the root tissues by microscopic studies, their effects on the production of critical medicinal compounds such as tanshinones and phenolic acids were investigated in the vegetation stage (120 days). Results: Our results showed that the content of cryptotanshinone (Cry) and tanshinone IIA (T-IIA) in plants inoculated with P. canescens increased by 77.00% and 19.64%, respectively, compared with non-inoculated plants (control). The contents of mentioned compounds in plants inoculated with Talaromyces sp. increased by 50.00% and 23.00%, respectively. In this case, in plants inoculated with P. canescens, it was found that the level of caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, and its PAL enzyme activity increased by 64.00%, 69.00%, and 50.00%, respectively, compared with the control. Conclusion: Endophytic fungi have specific modes of action and the ability to provide multiple benefits. Each of the two strains is a highly considerable microbial resource for the growth and accumulation of active compounds of S. abrotanoides.","J","Khorasani, FM; Ganjeali, A; Asili, J; Cheniany, M",NA,"","","Khorasani, Fatemeh Masoudi; Ganjeali, Ali; Asili, Javad; Cheniany, Monireh",NA,NA,"Beneficial effects of endophytic fungi inoculation on tanshinones and phenolic compounds of Salvia abrotanoides","IRANIAN JOURNAL OF BASIC MEDICAL SCIENCES","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cheniany, Monireh/ABG-5058-2020","Cheniany, Monireh/0000-0001-6390-1752",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2008-3866","2008-3874","",NA,NA,"APR",2023,26,"4",NA,"","",NA,"408","413","","10.22038/IJBMS.2023.67730.14828","http://dx.doi.org/10.22038/IJBMS.2023.67730.14828","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37009009,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000995383400003","View Full Record in Web of Science",306,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi were isolated from healthy, living, and symptomless tissues of inner bark, leaf, and roots of Aegle marmelos, a well-known medicinal plant, growing in different parts of India including Varanasi. A total of 79 isolates of endophytic fungi were isolated, representing 21 genera, adopting a standard isolation protocol. Members of the deuteromycotina were more prevalent than ascomycotina and others. The result was quite encouraging in terms of maximum isolates recovery from hyphomycetes (78.5%) followed by ascomycetes (8.9%) and coelomycetes (7.6%) respectively, which corroborates previous studies in same area. However, 5.1% isolates remained unidentified and were classified under Mycelia Sterilia. No isolate was obtained from either basidiomycotina or from zygomycotina. Fusarium spp. had maximum colonization frequency (8.00%) in this plant. The other dominant endophytic genera were Aspergillus spp., Alternaria sp., Drechslera sp., Rhizoctonia sp., Curvularia sp., Nigrospora sp., and Stenella sp. Only two ascomycetous members Chaetomium globosum and Emericella sp. (perfect state of Aspergillus sp.) were obtained from the bark sample.

"Huperzine A (HupA) is a drug used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. However, the biosynthesis of this medicinally important compound is not well understood. The HupA biosynthetic pathway is thought to be initiated by the decarboxylation of lysine to form cadaverine, which is then converted to 5-aminopentanal by copper amine oxidase (CAO). In this study, we cloned and expressed an SsCAO gene from a HupA-producing endophytic fungus, Shiraia sp. Slf14. Analysis of the deduced protein amino acid sequence showed that it contained the Asp catalytic base, conserved motif Asn-Tyr-Asp/Glu, and three copper-binding histidines. The cDNA of SsCAO was amplified and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), from which a 76 kDa protein was obtained. The activity of this enzyme was tested, which provided more information about the SsCAO gene in the endophytic fungus. Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) revealed that this SsCAO could accept cadaverine as a substrate to produce 5-aminopentanal, the precursor of HupA. Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that the SsCAO from Shiraia sp. Slf14 was closely related to Stemphylium lycopersici CAO. This is the first report on the cloning and expression of a CAO gene from HupA-producing endophytic fungi. Functional characterization of this enzyme provides new insights into the biosynthesis of the HupA an anti-Alzheimer's drug. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"Root rot caused by Fusarium sp., a ubiquitous soilborne disease, leads to huge economic losses for tobacco cultivation in China. However, comprehensive knowledge about the interactions between this fungal pathogen and other members of soil and endophytic fungal communities is very limited. In this study, how the invasion process of root rot disease affect the fungal communities of soils and endophytes was systematically studied by using both internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing and molecular ecological network analysis (MENA). The root endophytic fungal community diversity of root rot was 23.99 % and 76.27 % higher than healthy roots according to Shannon and Inv-Simpson indices, respectively. By integrating both community composition analysis and field disease symptoms, the root rot pathogen of this study was identified as Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. psidii. Soil and endophytic fungal communities affected by this pathogen showed more complex network structures and greater number of interaction relationships than those of healthy plants. Besides, the pathogen F. oxysporum had successfully invaded the roots and become a keystone species of endophytic fungal community during the invasion process. In addition, the genera Haematonectria and Ceratobasidium were positively correlated with the pathogen while the genera Eupenicillium, Alternaria, and two unclassified fungi were negatively corre-lated with the pathogen in the networks of infected roots.

"Endophytic fungi are a good source of bioactive compounds. A fungal, endophyte was isolated from stern sections of Garcinia lanceifolia and identified as Pestalotiopsis microspora based on morphological characteristics and nucleotide sequence of ITS1-5.85-ITS2 template region for r-RNA. A compound from the in vitro cultured fungal-biomass was purified and identified it as Ergosterol Peroxide (EP) based on H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR, H-1-C-13 HSQC, H-1-(1) DQFCOSY, DEPT-135 and IIR-ESI-MS spectra. EP exhibited cytotoxic activity against adherent tumor cell lines HeLa, MCF7, BT474 and A549 with IC50 values of 12.72 +/- 0.21, 14.78 +/- 0.22, 16 +/- 0.15 and 18.23 +/- 0.40 mu g/ml, respectively as well as a suspension cell line K562 (IC50 16.05 +/- 1.11 mu g/ml). EP also proved potent against drug resistant cell lines, K562-IR2 and K562-IR1 with IC50 values 9.42 +/- 0.12 and 12.69 +/- 0.23 mu g/ml, respectively. EP treatment showed dose-dependent reduction in phosphorylation of pro-survival STAT5 protein both in wild type and imatinib-resistant cell lines. An endophytic fungus, P. microspora, isolated in the present study can serve as a good source of bioactive molecule EP. For the first time, this study demonstrated potent cytotoxic activity of EP against imatinib resistant cell lines K562-IR1 and K562-IR2. EP can serve as a promising drug lead molecule for overcoming cancer drug-resistance.","J","Arolla, RG; Pallerla, PK; Cherukupalli, N; Kancha, RK; Sripadi, P; Sarma, AVS; Khareedu, VR; Vudem, DR",NA,"","","Arolla, Rajender Goud; Pallerla, Pavan Kumar; Cherukupalli, Neeraja; Kancha, Rama Krishna; Sripadi, Prabhakar; Sarma, Akella V.

"The diversity and cold adaptation of endophytic fungi associated with five dominant plant species collected from the Baima Snow Mountain (altitude 4,000-4,300 m), Southwest China, were investigated. A total of 604 culturable endophytic fungi were isolated from 800 stems and leaf segments. The colonization rate of endophytic fungi in the five plant species ranged from 54% to 91%, and the colonization rate of endophytic fungi in the stems was significantly higher (87%) than that in the leaves (67%) (X similar to aEuro parts per thousand 2 = 45.172, < 0.001, chi-squared test).

The Shannon-Weiner diversity indices and the Sorenson's coefficient similarity indices of the endophytic fungi from the five plant species ranged from 1.25 to 2.70 and 0.53 to 0.67, respectively. Growth temperature tests indicated that 75% of the isolates from the Baima Snow Mountain were psychrotrophs and 14% were the transitional type between psychrotrophs and mesophiles, whereas all of the isolates from the Yuanjiang Dry-hot Valley were mesophiles, which suggested that the endophytes from the Baima Snow Mountain possess a remarkable ability to adapt to cold environments.","J","Li, HY; Shen, M; Zhou, ZP; Li, T; Wei, YL; Lin, LB",NA,"","","Li, Hai-Yan; Shen, Mi; Zhou, Zuo-Ping; Li, Tao; Wei, Yun-lin; Lin, Lian-bing",NA,NA,"Diversity and cold adaptation of endophytic fungi from five dominant plant species collected from the Baima Snow Mountain, Southwest China","FUNGAL DIVERSITY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"jiang, lei/IWE-1124-2023","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1560-2745","1878-9129","",NA,NA,"MAY",2012,54,"1",NA,"","SI",NA,"79","86","","10.1007/s13225-012-0153-1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13225-012-0153-1","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000303881300008","View Full Record in Web of Science",311,"Presence"
"The valuable bioactive compounds produced by endophytic fungi hold huge potential, which may be utilized by pharmaceutical, agriculture or food industries. However, it has been observed that the genes responsible for the production of bioactive metabolites from fungal endophytes are not expressed in axenic cultures. The defined media used for the culture of fungal endophytes do not mimic nutrients available in their native hosts. Due to the lack of host stimulus in culture media, many genes encoding biosynthetic pathways become silent, thus limiting their capacity for the production of metabolites. These silent biosynthetic pathways of novel bioactive secondary molecules can be induced by the use of epigenetic modifiers. The epigenetic modulation can greatly induce endophytic fungi-derived bioactive metabolites. The chemical epigenetic methods are being developed for obtaining secondary metabolites from fungal endophyte cultures. The treatment of fungal endophytes with epigenetic modifiers such as DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors and/or his tone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors might be a favourable approach to trigger the biosynthetic pathways of bioactive metabolites that are quiescent under laboratory conditions. In addition, endophytic fungi are also known to modify plant gene expression and physical composition by causing epigenetic changes in the host. The use of epigenetic modifiers may boost our capacities to screen for medicinal compounds in plants and improve plant performance in changing climate conditions. (c) 2020 SAAB.

"Endophytic fungi represent ubiquitous microbial organisms able to live in the tissues of different plants around the world and represent a prolific source of bioactive metabolites. In the present study, the endophytic fungus Aspergillus calidoustus was isolated from the medicinal plant Acanthospermum australe (Asteraceae), and identified using molecular, physiological and morphological methods. A methylene chloride crude extract of A. calidoustus has been produced and subjected to antifungal bioassay-directed fractionation which resulted in the isolation of the two bioactive compounds: ophiobolin K and 6-epi-ophiobolin K. These pure compounds displayed antifungal activity against fungal plant pathogens, protozoal activity against Trypanosoma cruzi, and cytotoxic activity against human tumoral cell lines. The results show that A. calidoustus was able to produce the antifungal and cytotoxic metabolites ophiobolin K and 6-epi-ophiobolin K, which may help the fungus to colonise and occupy the substratum as well as survive in natural environments.","J","de Carvalho, CR; Vieira, MDA; Cantrell, CL; Wedge, DE; Alves, TMA; Zani, CL; Pimenta, RS; Sales, PA; Murta, SMF; Romanha, AJ; Rosa, CA; Rosa, LH",NA,"","","de Carvalho, Camila Rodrigues; Almeida Vieira, Mariana de Lourdes; Cantrell, Charles L.; Wedge, David E.; Alves, Tania M.

"In this study, enhancement of biodegradation and detoxification of recalcitrant anthraquinone dye was achieved by laccase from an electron beam irradiated (EBR) endophytic fungus without mediators. The partially purified laccase enzyme (160.8 +/- 1.15 U mg(-1)) from 0.2 kGy irradiated endophytic fungus Phomopsis sp. catalyzed more than 85% of Remazol Brilliant Blue R (RBBR) (50 mg(-1)) degradation into non-toxic molecules within 5 min. Laccase enzyme production increased to 1.6 fold (27.7 +/- 1.06 U mg(-1)) due to electron beam radiation (0.2 kGy) of Phomopsis sp. compared to the non-irradiated fungus (17.28 +/- 1.09 U mg(-1)). Laccase enzyme from electron beam irradiated fungus exhibited extreme tolerance for the metals Zn2+, Cu2+, Cr2+ and Ca2+ up to 10 mM concentration. The kinetic parameters V-max and K-m for enzymatic decolorization (0.2 kGy EBR) were estimated by Lineweaver-Burk plot and were found to be more potent than the laccase from non-irradiated fungus. The laccase enzyme retained activity in broad range of temperature (25-45 degrees C) and pH (4-8). The COD of the original dye was reduced to 60% after biodegradation by the irradiated fungus. The toxicity studies revealed that the degraded dye was non-toxic on plants and microbial growth. The data from LC-MS analysis clearly indicates partial degradation of dye into non-toxic molecules by laccase (0.2 kGy) following oxidation, hydroxylation, deamination and ring cleavage.","J","Navada, KK; Sanjeev, G; Kulal, A",NA,"","","Navada, Kavitha Keshava; Sanjeev, Ganesh; Kulal, Ananda",NA,NA,"Enhanced biodegradation and kinetics of anthraquinone dye by laccase from an electron beam irradiated endophytic fungus","INTERNATIONAL BIODETERIORATION & BIODEGRADATION","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kulal, Ananda/B-1140-2015","Kulal, Ananda/0000-0003-2628-1966",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0964-8305","1879-0208","",NA,NA,"AUG",2018,132,"",NA,"","",NA,"241","250","","10.1016/j.ibiod.2018.04.012","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2018.04.012","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000447358900028","View Full Record in Web of Science",315,"Presence"
"Fungal endophytes isolated from healthy Theobroma cacao tissues were screened in vitro for antagonism against major pathogens of cacao. Of tested endophytic morphospecies, 40% (21/52), 65% (28/43) and 27% percent (4/15) showed in vitro antagonism against Moniliophthora roreri (frosty pod rot), Phytophthora palmivora (black pod rot) and Moniliophthora perniciosa (witches broom), respectively. The most common antagonistic mechanism was simple competition for substrate. Nonetheless, 13%, 21%, and 0% of tested morphospecies showed clear antibiosis against M. roreri, P. palmivora, and M. perniciosa, respectively. One isolate of Trichoderma was observed to be parasitic on M. roreri. Endophyte species that were common in the host plants under natural conditions often are good colonizers and grow fast in vitro whereas antibiosis producers usually appear to be relatively rare in nature, tend to grow slowly in vitro, and often are not good colonizers. We suggest that there is an inherent general trade-off between fast growth (high colonization) and production of chemicals that produce antibiosis reactions. Finally, field trials assessing the effects of three endophytic fungi (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Clonostachys rosea and Botryosphaeria ribis) on pod loss due to M. roreri and Phytophthora spp. were conducted at four farms in Panama. Although the overall incidence of black pod rot was very low during the tests, treatment with C gloeosporioides significantly decreased pod loss due to that disease. We observed no decrease in pod loss due to frosty pod rot, but treatment with C rosea reduced the incidence of cacao pods with sporulating lesions of M. roreri by 10%. The observed reduction in pod loss due to Phytophthora spp., and sporulation by M. roreri, supports the potential of fungal endophytes as biological control agents. Further, these studies suggest that combined information from field censuses of endophytic fungi, in vitro studies, and greenhouse experiments can provide useful a priori criteria for identifying desirable attributes for potential biocontrol agents.

"Agricultural research of plant-derived endophytic fungi has grown in recent decades. We isolated 26 endophytic fungi from the leaves, stems and fruits of the tree of life, Camptotheca acuminata, and tested them for antimicrobial activities based on growth inhibition measurements in a modified agar diffusion method. Fermentation broths from most of the isolates exhibited antifungal activity and 50% exhibited antibacterial activity; some of them also exhibited strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. The strongest antimicrobial activity was exhibited by strains XSY10 and XSY15 against Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum, with 75% and 67% inhibition, respectively. Strain XSJ01 gave strong activity against pathogenic bacteria, with inhibition zones more than 20 mm in diameter. The isolates were identified by molecular methods as belonging to nine taxa: Nigrospora, Diaporthe, Alternaria, Colletotrichum, Pestalotiopsis, Sordariomycete, Guignardiai, Penicillium, and Zythia.

"Plant endophytic fungi have been recognized as an important and novel resource of natural bioactive products, especially in anticancer application. This review mainly deals with the research progress on the production of anticancer compounds by endophytic fungi between 1990 and 2013. Anticancer activity is generally associated with the cytotoxicity of the compounds present in the endophytic fungi. All strains of endophytes producing antitumor chemicals were classified taxonomically and the genera of Pestalotiopsis and Aspergillus as well as the taxol producing endophytes were focused on. Classification of endophytic fungi producing antitumor compounds has received more attention from mycologists, and it can also lead to the discovery of novel compounds with antitumor activity due to phylogenetic relationships. In this review, the structures of the anticancer compounds isolated from the newly reported endophytes between 2010 and 2013 are discussed including strategies for the efficient production of the desired compounds.

"Neuroprotection is one of the important protection methods against neuronal cells and tissue damage caused by neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and multiple sclerosis. Various bioactive compounds produced by medicinal plants can potentially treat central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Apart from these resources, endophytes also produce diverse secondary metabolites capable of protecting the CNS. The bioactive compounds produced by endophytes play essential roles in enhancing the growth factors, antioxidant defence functions, diminishing neuroinflammatory, and apoptotic pathways. The efficacy of compounds produced by endophytic fungi was also evaluated by enzymes, cell lines, and in vivo models. Acetylcholine esterase (AChE) inhibition is frequently used to assess in vitro neuroprotective activity along with cytotoxicity-induced neuronal cell lines.

"The endophytic fungi isolated from the medicinal plant are an essential part of the current drug discovery from natural products. The endophytic fungus isolated from the healthy leaves of Psidium guajava was identified based on microscopic and cultural characteristics. The phylogenetic analysis inferred based on the internal transcribed spacer rRNA region sequence showed close similarity to Fusarium oxysporum. The secondary metabolite produced in solid-state, and submerged fermentation was extracted using ethyl acetate and acetone. The antimicrobial activity of the crude extract was screened by the agar well diffusion method. The inhibitory effect of the extract against bacterial pathogens was evaluated by minimum bactericidal concentration MBC and microdilution MIC methods. The antibacterial activity of the crude extract is significant at p<0.05 level. The extract presented a broad spectrum of inhibition against all the tested bacteria with inhibition zone diameter from 6.67 +/- 0.58 mm to 22.00 +/- 1.00 mm. The extract showed strong antimicrobial activity with MIC value from 0.156 mg/ml to 5.0 mg/ml and the MBC from 0.625 mg/ml to 10.0 mg/ml. From the tested fungi, the crude extract showed inhibitory activity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but no inhibition to Candida albicans and Trichophyton interdigitale. Therefore, the fungus can be an ideal resource for the biological prospecting of antimicrobial agents.","J","Chutulo, EC; Chalannavar, RK",NA,"","","Chutulo, Eyob Chukalo; Chalannavar, Raju Krishna",NA,NA,"ANTIMICROBIAL ACTIVITY OF FUSARIUM OXYSPORUM, ENDOPHYTIC FUNGUS, ISOLATED FROM PSIDIUM GUAJAVA L.

"Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and endophytic fungi collectively symbiose well with plants and, thus, stimulate plant growth; however, it is not clear whether field inoculation of the fungi enhances the resistance potential of plants, particularly in citrus. In the present study, we inoculated AM fungi (Acaulospora scrobiculata, Diversispora spurca, and D. versiformis) and endophytic fungi (Piriformospora indica) on an eight-year-old lane late navel orange (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osb) trees grafted on Poncirus trifoliata in a field, and we analyzed the response of the leaf antioxidant defense system. Approximately 2 years after inoculation, the root fungal colonization rate and soil hyphal length significantly increased. Fungal inoculation significantly increased the activity of leaf antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase, and the content of non-enzymatic antioxidants, such as reduced ascorbic acid and reduced glutathione. As a result, fungi-inoculated plants maintained lower concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion radicals and lower levels of membrane lipid peroxidation (according to malondialdehyde level) in leaves than uninoculated plants. Among them, inoculation of D. spurca and A. scrobiculata showed relatively higher effects in enhancing the antioxidant defense system than the other fungi. Furthermore, inoculation of D. spurca induced expressions of CsFe-SOD, CsMn-SOD, CsPOD, CsCAT1, and CsPRR7; inoculation of A. scrobiculata and D. versiformis induced expressions of CsCAT1; CsCAT1 and CsPOD were also induced by inoculation of P. indica. All four inoculations almost upregulated expressions of CsFAD6. AM fungi had superior effects than endophytic fungi (e.g., P. indica). According to our findings, inoculation with beneficial fungi, specifically mycorrhizal fungus D. spurca, activated the antioxidant defense system of field citrus trees, thus, having potentially superior resistance in inoculated plants.","J","Li, QS; Xie, YC; Rahman, MM; Hashem, A; Abd Allah, EF; Wu, QS",NA,"","","Li, Qiu-Shuang; Xie, Ya-Chao; Rahman, Mohammed Mahabubur; Hashem, Abeer; Abd Allah, Elsayed Fathi; Wu, Qiang-Sheng",NA,NA,"Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi and Endophytic Fungi Activate Leaf Antioxidant Defense System of Lane Late Navel Orange","JOURNAL OF FUNGI","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Abd_Allah, Elsayed Fathi/N-6846-2017; Wu, Qiang-Sheng/A-1956-2012","Abd_Allah, Elsayed Fathi/0000-0002-8509-8953; Wu, Qiang-Sheng/0000-0002-3405-8409",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2309-608X","",NA,NA,"MAR",2022,8,"3",NA,"","",NA,"","","282","10.3390/jof8030282","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof8030282","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35330284,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000774882000001","View Full Record in Web of Science",326,"Presence"

"Endophytic fungi are those that inhabit within organs and tissues without causing damage, while mycorrhizal fungi develop hyphal complexes called pelotons within cortical cells of orchid roots. Although abundant and frequent in all plant organs, the role of endophytic fungi has been neglected in relation to orchid's early development. Pogoniopsis schenckii Cogn. is an aclorophyllated and mycoheterotrophic (MH) orchid. This study aimed at i) investigating the endophytic fungal community in organs of P. schenckii and its mycorrhizal fungi associated; ii) evaluating the ability of isolated fungus in the in vitro germination of the seeds of the species, and iii) describing the development of P. schenckii protocorm, analyzing the ultrastructure of the infected cells. Six genera of fungi were isolated and identified through the partial sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region, all belonging to the phylum Ascomycota. Also, Tulasnellaceae was identified through uncultured technique as potentially mycorrhizal in this MH orchid. Some isolates of the genera Trichoderma, Fusarium, and especially Clonostachys presented germinative potential on P. schenckii seeds, causing rupture of the external tegument. The protocorms showed complete absence of peloton formation, but fungal hyphae were clearly observed within living cells. This is the first report of germination of a MH and aclorophyllated orchid species stimulated by the presence of non-mycorrhizal endophytic fungi isolated from fruits and roots of the same species.","J","Sisti, LS; Flores-Borges, DNA; de Andrade, SAL; Koehler, S; Bonatelli, ML; Mayer, JLS",NA,"","","Sisti, Lais Soemis; Aline Flores-Borges, Denisele Neuza; Lopez de Andrade, Sara Adrian; Koehler, Samantha; Bonatelli, Maria Leticia; Sampaio Mayer, Juliana Lischka",NA,NA,"The Role of Non-Mycorrhizal Fungi in Germination of the Mycoheterotrophic Orchid Pogoniopsis schenckii Cogn.","FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mayer, Juliana L S/J-4822-2015; Andrade, Sara Adrián L./B-8509-2012; KOEHLER, SAMANTHA/D-3558-2012; Flores Borges, Denisele Neuza Aline/F-5579-2019","Mayer, Juliana L S/0000-0001-7439-5234; Andrade, Sara Adrián L./0000-0002-9895-9820; KOEHLER, SAMANTHA/0000-0003-0955-5339; Sisti, Lais Soemis/0000-0003-0859-9401; Flores Borges, Denisele Neuza Aline/0000-0002-8500-3205",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-462X","","",NA,NA,"NOV 29",2019,10,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","1589","10.3389/fpls.2019.01589","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2019.01589","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31850049,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000502757600001","View Full Record in Web of Science",329,"Presence"

"Agricultural crops including sunflower and soybean are facing thermal stress because of rapid change in climate caused by global warming. Some innovative steps should be taken on an emergency basis to prepare plants for such unfriendly stressful conditions. Use of endophytic fungi might be one of the successful weapons to protect food crops, susceptible to high temperature. These endophytes are known to secrete vital stress responsive secondary metabolites that not only provide resistance to crops against abiotic stresses but also help in promoting plants-growth and yield. Therefore, endophytic fungi were isolated from the leaves and roots of Adiantum capillus veneris L. and their potential were checked for secreting bioactive secondary metabolites and possessing plant-growth promoting potential. A high concentration of phenolics, flavonoids, salicylic acid (SA) and indole 3-acetic acid (IAA) were found in the culture filtrate of isolate AdR-1, thus confirming their growth promoting potential for plants. Later on, phylogenetic exploration and 18S rDNA sequence homology showed that the selected isolatic fungus is Rhizopus oryzae. This strain was inoculated to sunflower and soybean seedlings exposed to normal (25 degrees C) and high (40 degrees C) temperature stress in a growth chamber and their potential for thermal stress resistance was compared with control seedlings. Inoculated sunflower and soybean plants had shown low level of abscisic acid (ABA) while, high levels of ascorbic acid oxidase (AAO), catalase (CAT), proline, phenolics, flavonoids, sugars, proteins and lipids were noted. The endophytic fungus was also found stimulatory to chlorophyll content, shoot and root lengths, fresh and dry biomass as compared to un-inoculated plants. These results confirmed the beneficial role of R. oryzae for crop plants under thermal stress and suggested their use for sustainable agriculture in the future.","J","Ismail; Hussain, A; Mehmood, A; Qadir, M; Husna, H; Iqbal, A; Hamayun, M; Khan, N",NA,"","","Ismail; Hussain, Anwar; Mehmood, Asif; Qadir, Muhammad; Husna, Husna; Iqbal, Amjad; Hamayun, Muhammad; Khan, Naeem",NA,NA,"THERMAL STRESS ALLEVIATING POTENTIAL OF ENDOPHYTIC FUNGUS RHIZOPUS ORYZAE INOCULATED TO SUNFLOWER (HELIANTHUS ANNUUS L.)

"Centella asiatica (L.) Urban is a highly considered medicinal plant owing to its secondary metabolites asiaticoside, madecassoside, asiatic acid, and madecassic acid. The asiaticoside, one of the most important constituents of the plant, is a triterpenoid saponin having memory enhancement property. Given its medicinal properties, we isolated and characterized endophytic fungi from this plant with the aim to screen these microorganisms for asiaticoside production. In total, we isolated 13 endophytic fungi from the leaves of the plant, out of which one of the isolates produced asiaticoside. This asiaticoside producing isolate was identified as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides by internal transcribed spacer-based rDNA sequencing. The presence of asiaticoside in ethyl acetate extract of C. gloeosporioides was confirmed by LC-MS. The production of asiaticoside measured in relation to incubation time and subculture generation revealed presence of 62.29 +/- 3.36 A mu g/100 mL of asiaticoside by C. gloeosporioides on the 15th day in first subculture generation followed by a decrease in subsequent generations. A similar trend was also shown by yield and growth curve of C. gloeosporioides. The asiaticoside production and yield were found to be positively correlated. This paper reported the production of asiaticoside by an endophytic fungus C. gloeosporioides for the first time. The present findings definitely provide an impetus to the production of asiaticoside by utilizing the endophytic source.

"Objective: To isolate new endophytic fungus from Phaleria macrocarpa (P. macrocarpa) that is able to produce E2.2 compound. Methods: Endophytic fungi were isolated from P. macrocarpa. Morphological and molecular identification was done to determine the species of the endophytic fungus. High performance liquid chromatography was used to determine the ability of this fungus to produce E2.2 compound and to quantify the total yield of E2.2 from fungal fermentation. Fermentation process was optimized by observing suitable medium, pH and length of fermentation process. Phloroglucinol and gallic acid addition were examined to determine the effect of each compound on E2.2 production. Results: One endophytic fungus was successfully isolated from P. macrocarpa plant. Morphological and molecular identification showed that it was a Colletotrichum gloeosporioides which belonged to Glomerellaceae family. This fungus showed highest production of E2.2 when incubated in potato dextrose broth with initial pH value of the medium at 5, and was incubated for 15 days. Phloroglucinol was found to better enhance E2.2 production.

"Rohitukine is a chromane alkaloid possessing anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and immuno-modulatory properties. The compound was first reported from Amoora rohituka (Meliaceae) and later from Dysoxylum binectariferum (Meliaceae) and Schumanniophyton problematicum (Rubiaceae). Flavopiridol, a semi-synthetic derivative of rohitukine is a potent CDK inhibitor and is currently in Phase III clinical trials. In this study, the isolation of an endophytic fungus, Fusarium proliferatum (MTCC 9690) from the inner bark tissue of Dysoxylum binectariferum Hook.f (Meliaceae) is reported. The endophytic fungus produces rohitukine when cultured in shake flasks containing potato dextrose broth. The yield of rohitukine was 186 mu g/100 g dry mycelial weight, substantially lower than that produced by the host tissue. The compound from the fungus was authenticated by comparing the LC-HRMS and LC-HRMS/MS spectra with those of the reference standard and that produced by the host plant.

"Endophytic fungi are microorganisms located in the inter- or intracellular compartments of plant tissues but with no harmful effects. They are considered a potential source of biological compounds. The present study was conducted to investigate the molecular identification of endophytic fungi isolated from the roots of Lithospermum officinale and their potential production of shikonin. Phylogenetic analysis was performed based on the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region and the isolates were classified into five genera as follows: Alternaria, Chaetosphaeronema, Fusarium, Mucor, and Trichoderma. The study on the methanol extracts of endophytic fungi indicated that total polyphenol content had a positive relationship with antioxidant activities and the highest antioxidant activity belonged to the methanol extracts of Fusarium tricinctum and Alternaria altenata. Then, to investigate the ability of the fungal isolates to produce shikonin, a naphthoquinone compound with high biological activity, the extracts were subjected to HPLC. The results obtained from HPLC-mass spectrometry showed that shikonin could be produced only by F. tricinctum.

"Torreya grandis is a rare tree species of economic value. Its seeds are rich in lipids, although their use is limited by their high cost. Recent studies demonstrated that certain endophytic fungi can produce metabolites similar to those produced by the host plant. In the present study, endophytic fungal strains capable of producing lipids were isolated from wild Chinese Torreya grandis. Among these, the XF-38 strain had the highest lipid content at 17.68%. Comparative analysis of the fatty acid composition of lipids produced by endophytic fungi and Torreya seeds by GC-MS showed that the two sources shared some of the same components, including linoleic acid, oleic acid, and sciadonic acid (5c, 11c, 14c-eicosatrienoic acid). The morphology and internal transcribed spacer rDNA of the XF-38 strain were determined, and a BLAST search showed that this strain belongs to Bionectria ochroleuca.

"Endophytic fungi associated with Chinese medicinal plant Dendrobium officinale have been revealed using the culture-dependent approach and the diversity and antimicrobial activity have been examined in this study. A total of 105 endophytic isolates representing 16 fungal morphotypes were recovered from the roots, stems and leaves of D. officinale. Identification by ITS-rDNA sequencing showed 12 distinct operational taxonomic units, and most of them were classified into species level. Shannon's and Simpson's indices were calculated to quantify fungal diversity. The results demonstrated that endophytic fungi associated with D. officinale were moderately diverse, and fungal species among three tissues was also different which exhibited tissue-specificity. The composition of endophyte assemblages from the roots was most abundant and diverse, followed by the stems, while the leaves possessed relatively low isolation rate. Fusarium oxysporum (21.0%) and Xylaria cubensis (20.0%) were the most dominant species, while Colletotrichum sp. and Pestalotiopsis sp. were also frequently isolated. Three species (F. oxysporum, Aspergillus niger and Aureobasidium pullulan) showed broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, and F. oxysporum had acute inhibition to pathogens tested.

"Many endophytic fungi have the potential to function as saprotrophs when living host tissues senesce and enter the litter pool. The consumption of plant litter by fungi obviously requires moisture but, in the arid, western USA, the native range of Quercus gambelii Nutt., most of the precipitation occurs during the coldest months of the year. Therefore, we hypothesized that the endophytic fungi of Q. gambelii have the potential to function as psychrotolerant saprotrophs, which we defined in this study as an organism capable of significant growth on leaf litter at 5 degrees C. We further hypothesized that a tradeoff exists between growth of endophytic fungi at 5 degrees C and at 17 degrees C such that fungal isolates are either cold- or warm-temperature specialists. Consistent with our first hypothesis, we found that 36 of our 40 isolates consumed leaf litter at 5 degrees C, but there was a surprisingly high degree of variability among isolates in this ability, even among isolates of a given species. Contrary to our second hypothesis, there was no tradeoff between saprotrophic growth at 5 degrees C and saprotrophic growth at 17 degrees C. Indeed, the isolates that grew poorly as saprotrophs at 5 degrees C were generally those that grew poorly as saprotrophs at 17 degrees C. By virtue of being endophytic, endophytic fungi have priority in litter over decomposer fungi that colonize plant tissues only after they enter the litter pool. Moreover, by virtue of being psychrotolerant, some endophytic fungi may function as saprotrophs during the cold months of the year when moisture is temporarily available. Therefore, we suggest that some endophytic fungi of Q. gambelii could play significant ecosystem roles in litter decomposition and nutrient cycling.","J","Weatherhead, E; Davis, EL; Koide, RT",NA,"","","Weatherhead, Emily; Davis, Emily Lorine; Koide, Roger T.",NA,NA,"Many foliar endophytic fungi of Quercus gambelii are capable of psychrotolerant saprotrophic growth","PLOS ONE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Koide, Roger/AAE-7763-2020","Koide, Roger/0000-0002-5209-5422",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1932-6203","","",NA,NA,"OCT 12",2022,17,"10",NA,"","",NA,"","","e0275845","10.1371/journal.pone.0275845","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0275845","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36223398,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000891284400041","View Full Record in Web of Science",342,"Presence"

"BACKGROUNDThe European woodwasp, Sirex noctilio, is a global invasive pest, attacking a wide variety of pine species by inoculating spores of a symbiotic fungus (Amylostereum areolatum) at oviposition. The woodwasp larvae depend on the growth of the symbiotic fungus to feed. The relationship among host endophytic fungi, symbiotic fungus and woodwasp remain elusive. Here, the effects of endophytes in Mongolian pine on the growth of Amylostereum areolatum and the selection behavior of female woodwasp were investigated by quantifying the mycelium growth rates and olfactometry assays. RESULTSThe endophytic plant fungi, Trichoderma harzianum, Phlebiopsis gigantea, T. viride and T. atroviride, completely killed the mycelia of Amylostereum areolatum. Mycelium fermentation broth of Chaetomium globosum inhibited the growth of the symbiont. Moreover, we observed that volatiles of Ophiostoma minus and Aspergillus niger (acetophenone, acetylacetone, hexadecane, phenylethyl alcohol, and isopropyl myristate) had repellent effects on adult female woodwasp. While volatiles of Amylostereum areolatum ((-)-globulol, 2-hexene, cycloprop[e]indene-1a,2(1H)-dicarboxaldehyde, terpene and cyclopentanone) had a significant attractiveness to adult female woodwasp. CONCLUSIONSSome species of the host endophytic fungi had a significant negative effect on the growth and development of woodwasps, which could be useful in the monitoring and effective management of woodwasps.

"The growing threat arises due to diseases such as cancer and the infections around the world leading to a critical requirement for novel and constructive compounds with unique ways of action capable of combating these deadly diseases. At present, it is evident that endophytic fungi constitute an enormous as well as comparatively untapped source of great biodiversity that can be considered as a wellspring of effective novel natural products for medical, agricultural and industrial use. Marine endophytic fungi have been found in every marine plants (algae, seagrass, driftwood, mangrove plants), marine vertebrates (mainly, fish) or marine invertebrates (mainly, sponge and coral) inter- and intra-cellular without causing any palpable symptoms of illness. Since evolution of microbes and eukaryotes to a higher level, coevolution has resulted in specific interaction mechanisms. Endophytic fungi are known to influence the life cycle and are necessary for the homeostasis of their eukaryotic hosts and the chemical signals of their host have been shown to activate gene expression in endophytes to induce expression of endophytic secondary metabolites. Marine endophytic fungi are receiving increasing attention by chemists because of their varied and structurally unmatched compounds that have strong biological roles in life as lead pharmaceutical compounds, including anticancer, antiviral, insulin mimetic, antineurodegenerative, antimicrobial, antioxidant and immuno-suppressant compounds. Moreover, fungal endophytes proved to have different biological activities for exploitation in the environmental and agricultural sustainability.","J","El-Bondkly, EAM; El-Bondkly, AAM; El-Bondkly, AAM",NA,"","","El-Bondkly, Esraa Ahmed Mohamed; El-Bondkly, Alaa Ahmed Mohamed; El-Bondkly, Aya Ahmed Mohamed",NA,NA,"Marine endophytic fungal metabolites: A whole new world of pharmaceutical therapy exploration","HELIYON","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","El-Bondkly, Alaa Ahmed Mohamed/0000-0002-3285-3281; El-Bondkly, Esraa Ahmed Mohamed/0000-0001-5168-5685",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2405-8440","",NA,NA,"MAR",2021,7,"3",NA,"","",NA,"","","e06362","10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06362","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06362","","MAR 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33869822,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000638235800012","View Full Record in Web of Science",346,"Review"
"Insect association with fungi has a long history. Theories dealing with the evolution of insect herbivory indicate that insects used microbes including fungi as their principal food materials before flowering plants evolved. Subtlety and the level of intricacy in the interactions between insects and fungi indicate symbiosis as the predominant ecological pattern. The nature of the symbiotic interaction that occurs between two organisms (the insect and the fungus), may be either mutualistic or parasitic, or between these two extremes. However, the triangular relationship involving three organisms, viz., an insect, a fungus, and a vascular plant is a relationship that is more complicated than what can be described as either mutualism or parasitism, and may represent facets of both. Recent research has revealed such a complex relationship in the vertically transmitted type-I endophytes living within agriculturally important grasses and the pestiferous insects that attack them. The intricacy of the association depends on the endophytic fungus-grass association and the insect present. Secondary compounds produced in the endophytic fungus-grass association can provide grasses with resistance to herbivores resulting in mutualistic relationship between the fungus and the plant that has negative consequences for herbivorous insects. The horizontally transmitted nongrass type-II endophytes are far less well studied and as such their ecological roles are not fully understood. This forum article explores the intricacy of dependence in such complex triangular relationships drawing from well-established examples from the fungi that live as endophytes in vascular plants and how they impact on the biology and evolution of free-living as well as concealed (e. g., gall-inducing, gall-inhabiting) insects. Recent developments with the inoculation of strains of type-I fungal endophytes into grasses and their commercialization are discussed, along with the possible roles the endophytic fungi play in the galls induced by the Cecidomyiidae (Diptera).","J","Raman, A; Wheatley, W; Popay, A",NA,"","","Raman, A.; Wheatley, W.; Popay, A.",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungus-Vascular Plant-Insect Interactions","ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Raman, Anantanarayanan/0000-0002-7293-7412; Popay, Alison/0000-0002-0201-5308",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0046-225X","1938-2936","",NA,NA,"JUN",2012,41,"3",NA,"","",NA,"433","447","","10.1603/EN11317","http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EN11317","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,22732600,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000305475600004","View Full Record in Web of Science",347,"Review"
"Eighteen endophytic fungi were isolated from various tissues of Datura metel and genes encoding for putrescine N-methyltransferase (PMT), tropinone reductase 1 (TR1) and hyoscyamine 6 beta-hydroxylase (H6H) were used as molecular markers for PCR-based screening approach for tropane alkaloids (TAs) producing endophytic fungi. These fungi were identified taxonomically by sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) and also based on morphological characteristics of the fungal spore as Colletotrichum boninense, Phomopsis sp., Fusarium solani, Colletotrichum incarnatum, Colletotrichum siamense and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. The production of TAs hyoscyamine and scopolamine by the fungi has been ascertained using chromatography and spectroscopy methods by comparison with the standards. Among the fungi, the highest yields of hyoscyamine (3.9 mg/L) and scopolamine (4.1 mg/L) were found in C. incarnatum culture. This is the first report of endophytic fungi possess the PMT, TR1 and H6H genes and produces TAs.

"Endophytic fungi are an integral part and even seen as host organs of plant, influencing physiology, ecology, and development of host plants. However, little is known about micro-ecosystems and functional interactions of endophytic fungi in root-parasitic interactions of Cynomorium songaricum and its host Nitraria tangutorum. Here, distribution and dynamics of endophytic fungi were objectively investigated in their associations with C. songaricum and N. tangutorum based on mycobiome studies using high-throughput sequencing. Results suggest that endophytic fungi may be exchanged between C. songaricum and its host N. tangutorum probably through haustorium, connection of xylem and phloem in the vascular system. The similarity of endophytic fungal composition between C. songaricum and parasitized N. tangutorum was 3.88% which was significantly higher than the fungal similarity of 0.10% observed between C. songaricum and non-parasitized N. tangutorum. The similarities of fungal community in parasitized N. tangutorum were much closer to C. songaricum than to the non-parasitized N. tangutorum. The composition of endophytic fungi in these associations increased in progressive developmental stages of C. songaricum from sprouting to above ground emergence, and decreased subsequently probably due to host recognition and response by fungi. However, the shared fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) increased among interactions of C. songaricum with parasitized and non-parasitized N. tangutorum. Studies of bioactivity on culturable endophytic fungi showed that isolates such as Fusarium spp. possess the ability to promote seed germination of C. songaricum. Our study reports for the first time the special ecological system of endophytic fungi in C. songaricum and its host N. tangutorum. Overall, we hypothesize that a deeper understanding of the sharing, movement, and role of endophytic fungi between root-parasitic plant and its host may lead to finding alternative approaches to help increase the output of ethno-pharmacologically important medicinal plants.","J","Cui, JL; Vijayakumar, V; Zhang, G",NA,"","","Cui, Jin-Long; Vijayakumar, Vinod; Zhang, Gang",NA,NA,"Partitioning of Fungal Endophyte Assemblages in Root-Parasitic Plant Cynomorium songaricum and Its Host Nitraria tangutorum","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Vijayakumar, Vinod/0000-0002-4923-5551",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1664-302X","",NA,NA,"APR 5",2018,9,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","666","10.3389/fmicb.2018.00666","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2018.00666","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29686655,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000429288500003","View Full Record in Web of Science",349,"Presence"
"Symbiotic associations between endophytic fungi, hereon referred to as mycoendophytes, and their hosts involve several metabolic and regulatory processes. The exact molecular signal mechanisms that underlie these interactions are largely unidentified. Nevertheless, phytohormones seem to play key roles in the establishment and perpetuation of these symbiotic associations including plant-mycoendophyte symbiosis. Strigolactones, a group of apocarotenoid phytohormones, are known to influence both plant and fungal developmental processes e.g. modulation of host-root parasitic plant interactions and the activation of hyphae growth and branching. However, their role in plant-mycoendophyte interactions remains largely undescribed. Here, we provide a concise synthesis of current scientific knowledge on strigolactone influences in shaping plant-mycoendophyte symbiotic interactions, while also providing some perspective and research directions on critical molecular, physiological and ecological aspects that hold promise to deepen our understanding of this biologically and ecologically significant interaction.

"Tetrastigma hemsleyanum is a rare medicinal plant in China. Because it requires very strict environmental conditions to grow, it usually takes 3-5 years to form calabash-shaped roots and is difficult to meet the demand of Chinese medical market. Although it is known that endophytes can enhance the growth of the host plants, the molecular mechanism of the interplay between endophytes and their host plants growth is not completely understood yet. The aim of this study was to determine if endophytes can reduce the growth cycle and promote the medicinal ingredients in Tetrastigma hemsleyanum, and elucidate its underlying molecular mechanism. Endophytic fungi were isolated and identified from the calabash-shaped root of Tetrastigma hemsleyanum. The fermentation broth of 6 endophyte strains (named as TH09, TH12, TH14, TH15, TH17 and TH26) were added to the MS medium to culture axenic plantlets. After 30 days of culture, the net growth, expansin gene expression and the flavonoid content were measured. From the calabash-shaped roots, we isolated 31 endophytic fungi belonging to 10 genera: Fusarium, Rhizopycnis, Colletotrichum, Cylindrocarpon, Emericellopsi, Penicillium, Plectosphaerella, Aspergillus tubingensis, Alternaria and Sarocladium, of which Fusarium is the dominant genus. Addition of the fermentation broth from strains TH12, TH15 and TH26 significantly increased the plant growth. Strains TH15 and TH26's fermentation broth increased the expression of Th-exp (an expansin gene), while addition of the fermentation broth from TH14 increased Th-exp expression in leaves and stems, but decreased Th-exp expression in the root. Flavonoid content was increased in the presence of fermentation broth from strains TH09, TH14, TH17 and TH26. Particularly, the fermentation broth from TH26 can promote plant growth, enhance Th-exp expression and increase the flavonoid content in Tetrastigma hemsleyanum. The results demonstrated that endophytic fungi from the calabash-shaped root of Tetrastigma hemsleyanum can regulate plant growth, expression of expansin gene and flavonoid content.","J","Song, YL; Wu, P; Li, YF; Tong, XX; Zheng, YF; Chen, ZH; Wang, LL; Xiang, TH",NA,"","","Song, Yaling; Wu, Pan; Li, Yafei; Tong, Xiaxiu; Zheng, Yifang; Chen, Zhehao; Wang, Lilin; Xiang, Taihe",NA,NA,"Effect of endophytic fungi on the host plant growth, expression of expansin gene and flavonoid content in Tetrastigma hemsleyanum Diels & Gilg ex Diels","PLANT AND SOIL","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WANG, JIAXUAN/JMP-8599-2023; Lin, Xin/L-9950-2013; xin, li/JCO-3925-2023","Lin, Xin/0000-0002-7491-8928;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0032-079X","1573-5036","",NA,NA,"AUG",2017,417,"1-2",NA,"","",NA,"393","402","","10.1007/s11104-017-3266-1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-017-3266-1","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000407750900027","View Full Record in Web of Science",351,"Presence"

"To understand the distribution of the cultivable fungal community in plant tissues and the associations of these fungi with their surrounding environments during the geographical expansion of an invasive plant, Ageratina adenophora, we isolated the cultivable fungi from 72 plant tissues, 12 soils, and 12 air samples collected from six areas in Yunnan Province, China. A total of 4066 isolates were investigated, including 1641 endophytic fungi, 233 withered leaf fungi, 1255 fungi from air, and 937 fungi from soil. These fungi were divided into 458 and 201 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with unique and 97% ITS gene sequence identity, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the fungi belonged to four phyla, including Ascomycota (94.20%), Basidiomycota (2.71%), Mortierellomycota (3.03%), and Mucoromycota (0.07%). The dominant genera of cultivable endophytic fungi were Colletotrichum (34.61%), Diaporthe (17.24%), Allophoma (8.03%), and Fusarium (4.44%). Colletotrichum and Diaporthe were primarily isolated from mature leaves, Allophoma from stems, and Fusarium from roots, indicating that the enrichment of endophytic fungi is tissue-specific and fungi rarely grew systemically within A. adenophora. In the surrounding environment, Alternaria (21.46%), Allophoma (19.31%), Xylaria (18.45%), and Didymella (18.03%) were dominant in the withered leaves, Cladosporium (22.86%), Trichoderma (14.27%), and Epicoccum (9.83%) were dominant in the canopy air, and Trichoderma (27.27%) and Mortierella (20.46%) were dominant in the rhizosphere soils. Further analysis revealed that the cultivable endophytic fungi changed across geographic areas and showed a certain degree of variation in different tissues of A. adenophora. The cultivable fungi in mature and withered leaves fluctuated more than those in roots and stems. We also found that some cultivable endophytic fungi might undergo tissue-to-tissue migration and that the stem could be a transport tissue by which airborne fungi infect roots. Finally, we provided evidence that the fungal community within A. adenophora was partially shared with the contiguous environment. The data suggested a frequent interaction between fungi associated with A. adenophora and those in surrounding environments, reflecting a compromise driven by both functional requirements for plant growth and local environmental conditions.","J","Fang, K; Miao, YF; Chen, L; Zhou, J; Yang, ZP; Dong, XF; Zhang, HB",NA,"","","Fang, Kai; Miao, Yi-Fang; Chen, Lin; Zhou, Jie; Yang, Zhi-Ping; Dong, Xing-Fan; Zhang, Han-Bo",NA,NA,"Tissue-Specific and Geographical Variation in Endophytic Fungi of Ageratina adenophora and Fungal Associations With the Environment","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Chen, Lin/0000-0002-6352-4704; Fang, Kai/0000-0001-5030-6081",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-302X","","",NA,NA,"DEC 18",2019,10,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","2919","10.3389/fmicb.2019.02919","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.02919","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31921082,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000504977800001","View Full Record in Web of Science",353,"Presence"
"Bauhinia guianensis is a typical plant in the Amazon region belonging to the family Leguminosea, used by local populations for the treatment of infectious and renal diseases. Previous work on the plant B. guianensis led to the isolation of substances with anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities.

"Bauhinia forficata is native to South America and used with relative success in the folk medicine in Brazil. The diversity, antibacterial activity, and extracellular hydrolytic enzymes of endophytic fungi associated with this plant were studied. Plant samples, which included leaves, sepals, stems, and seeds, were used. Ninety-five endophytic fungal were isolated (18 from leaves, 22 from sepals, 46 from stems, and nine from seeds), comprising 28 species. The most frequently isolated species were Acremonium curvulum (9.5%), Aspergillus ochraceus (7.37%), Gibberella fujikuroi (10.53%), Myrothecium verrucaria (10.53%) and Trichoderma piluliferum (7.37%). Diversity and species richness were higher in stem tissues, and Sorensen's index of similarity between the tissues was low. Eleven fungi showed antibacterial activity. Aspergillus ochraceus, Gibberella baccata, Penicillium commune, and P. glabrum were those with the greatest antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and/or Streptococcus pyogenes. Thirteen species showed proteolytic activity, particularly Phoma putaminum. Fourteen species were cellulase positive, particularly the Penicillium species and Myrmecridium schulzeri. All isolates tested were xylanase positive and 10 showed lipolytic activity, especially Penicillium glabrum. It is clear that the endophytic fungi from B. forficata have potential for the production of bioactive compounds and may be a source of new therapeutic agents for the effective treatment of diseases in humans, other animals, and plants.

"Endophytic fungi, as a kind of fungi living in the healthy plant tissues and organs, are important sources of natural bioactive products and new microbial resources with high developing value. Therefore, exploration and utilization of endophytic fungi can not only alleviate the problems of resource shortage and ecological balance destruction caused by extracting large number of useful bioactive products from natural plants, but also benefit the protection of rare and endangered plant resources, which is of great significance and economic value. This review mainly expounds the concept of endophytic fungi, analyzes the research advances of endophytic fungi from antioxidant, antibacterial, insecticidal, regulating plant growth, anticancer and antitumor bioactivities and, furthermore, summarizes the existing problems in present research of endophytic fungi and corresponding solutions. We hope that this review could provide references for the development and utilization of endophytic fungi and their bioactive metabolites.

"Frequent anthropogenic activities have led to a rapid increase in atmospheric reactive N inputs in terrestrial ecosystems, negatively affecting plant and microbial communities. Endophytic fungi are important symbiotic microbes that are beneficial for improving host environmental adaptability. However, it remains poorly understood how endophytic fungi affect bacterial communities and related root metabolites contribute to improved plant adaptability to elevated N inputs. Here, we used 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and GC-MS platform to investigate the effects of Epichloe & BULL; gansuensis infection on Achnatherum inebrians response to N addition. The results showed E. gansuensis infected (E+) A. inebrians exhibited more biomass and less phosphorus (P) limitation than E. gansuensis uninfected (E-) A. inebrians under N enrichment conditions. Analysis of the bacterial community indicated that rhizosphere and endophyte bacterial community compositions and structures presented significant differences between E+ and E- plants. N addition enhanced the proportion of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Nitrospirae, and putative plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) (e.g. Bacillus and Lysobacter) in the E+ plant, facilitating the uptake of rhizosphere nutrients. Network analysis showed that E. gansuensisinfection enhanced the complexity and intraspecific cooperation of bacterial community under N addition conditions. Moreover, metabolomics analysis indicated that the compositions of root exudates of E- plant were more susceptible to N addition than those of E+ plant. Correlation analysis showed that root microbiota were also closely related to the accumulation of root metabolites. Our findings provide a significant understanding of the symbiotic relationship between host and endophytic fungi in the N enrichment environment.","J","Jin, J; Wang, JF; Niu, XL; Wang, C; Malik, K; Li, CJ",NA,"","","Jin, Jie; Wang, Jianfeng; Niu, XueLi; Wang, Chao; Malik, Kamran; Li, Chunjie",NA,NA,"Integrated microbiology and metabolomics analysis reveal patterns and mechanisms of improvement the Achnatherum inebrians adaptability to N addition by endophytic fungus Epichloe• gansuensis","ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Li, Chunjie/G-4988-2012; Wang, lili/IXD-9828-2023","Li, Chunjie/0000-0002-3287-2140;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0098-8472","1873-7307","",NA,NA,"SEP",2023,213,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","105421","10.1016/j.envexpbot.2023.105421","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2023.105421","","JUN 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001034925700001","View Full Record in Web of Science",360,"Presence"

"Dark septate endophytic fungi are symbiotes that play an important role in plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. In this study, 65 strains of endophytic fungi were obtained from tobacco roots using a tissue isolation method. Strains NYN8C05 and NYN8G01 were identified as Acrocalymma vagum based on ITS rDNA sequence analysis and morphological characteristics. Co-culture experiments showed that strains NYN8C05 and NYN8G01 can promote the growth of tobacco seedlings. Observations of roots after trypan blue staining showed that strains NYN8C05 and NYN8G01 colonized the roots and formed dark septate hyphae and microsclerotia. These results confirmed that strains NYN8C05 and NYN8G01 were dark septate endophytic fungi. Pot experiments showed that NYN8C05 and NYN8G01 significantly decreased the heavy metal content in leaves of tobacco plants.

"Herbivorous insects are known to be resistant to fungal endophytes that asymptomatically inhabit plant tissues. The insecticidal ability of the endophytic fungus Aspergillus terreus isolated from Catharanthus roseus against Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) was assessed in the current study. The survival and growth of S. litura were adversely impacted by the ethyl acetate extract of endophytic A. terreus. Fungal extract supplemented diet caused 14 to 94% larval mortality in comparison to 2% in control. Additionally, retarded insect growth was observed after ingestion of supplemented diet. The fungal metabolites were also observed to have an inhibitory influence on the adult emergence and reproductive potential of adults. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of phenolic compounds in the crude extract of endophytic fungus which may be responsible for toxicity. It was also determined how endophyte-infected cauliflower plants affected S. litura's survival and growth. Endophyte-infected plants exhibited resistance to S. litura by causing 54% larval mortality and delaying development by 5.2 days. In comparison to uninfected plants, adult emergence, lifespan, fecundity and egg hatchability of insects was significantly decreased on infected plants. There was a significant decrease in relative growth and consumption rates as well as in the efficiency of food conversion, which indicates toxic and antifeedant effect of the fungus on S. litura. This suggests that endophyte-inoculated plants exhibit antibiosis against S. litura. In conclusion, the endophytic fungi having insecticidal activity could be used to develop alternative ecologically safe control strategies.","J","Singh, S; Kaur, S; Kaur, R; Kaur, A",NA,"","","Singh, Surbjit; Kaur, Sanehdeep; Kaur, Rajvir; Kaur, Amarjeet",NA,NA,"Impact of Plant Symbiotic Endophytic Fungus, Aspergillus terreus on Insect Herbivore Spodoptera litura (Fabricius) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)","NEOTROPICAL ENTOMOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1519-566X","1678-8052","",NA,NA,"OCT",2023,52,"5",NA,"","",NA,"932","944","","10.1007/s13744-023-01070-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13744-023-01070-0","","AUG 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37530941,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001041417300001","View Full Record in Web of Science",364,"Presence"
"Leaf-cutting ants of the genera Acromyrmex and Atta forage vegetation for incorporation into their mutualistic fungal gardens. However, the presence of certain endophytic fungi in this predominantly leaf-based material could affect the fungal garden and thus the choice of material by the ants. The present study was conducted to document the endophytic fungal communities occurring in the vegetation being transported by workers of Atta laevigata into their nests and to compare this community structure with that of the vegetative material subsequently rejected from the nests. We found considerable diversity in the fungi isolated. Acremonium, Cylindrocladium, Drechslera, Epicoccum, Fusarium, Trichoderma, Ulocladium and two unidentified morphospecies were significantly more common in rejected compared with foraged material, and some of these genera include mycoparasites, which could represent a threat to the fungal gardens. Conversely, Colletotrichum, Pestalotiopsis, Phomopsis, Xylaria and an unidentified morphospecies were more common in carried compared with rejected material. The possibility that ants have a 'quality-control' mechanism based on the presence of antagonistic fungal endophytes is discussed, as is the potential use of these fungi as biocontrol agents against Attini pests.","J","Rocha, SL; Jorge, VL; Della Lucia, TMC; Barreto, RW; Evans, HC; Elliot, SL",NA,"","","Rocha, Silma L.; Jorge, Vanessa L.; Della Lucia, Terezinha M.

"Gannan navel orange is a famous brand in China but the isolation of its endophytic fungi was rarely reported. In this study, a total of 54 strains of endophytic fungi were successfully isolated from the pulp, peel, twig, and leaf of Gannan navel orange; they were successfully identified to belong to 17 species of 12 genera. All these strains were fermented using potato-dextrose agar (PDA) medium, and their secondary metabolites were then extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The antibacterial assays of Escherichia coli (E. coli), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc) were also performed for the EtOAc extracts of these strains. As a result, the extracts of both Geotrichum sp.

"(Distribution of the endophytic fungi community in leaves of Bauhinia brevipes (Fabaceae)). Endophytic fungi represent large, yet unexplored components of biodiversity. This work evaluated the richness and the distribution of endophytes in the leaves of Bauhinia brevipes (Fabaceae). A total of 1110 colonies were recovered from the samples and grouped by their morphological traits into 126 taxa. The total number of taxa according to leaf development was: 102 in mature leaves, 93 in recently expanded leaves and 79 for unfolded leaves. The major endophyte genera were Phomopsis, followed by Dothiorella, Pestalotiopsis and Acremonium. The richness and the isolate numbers of endophytes were not statistically affected by leaf region. However, some taxa were leaf-age specific; six were isolated only from unfolded leaves, nine from recently expanded leaves and 17 were exclusively found in mature leaves. The composition of endophytes varied with leaf region; the similarities (Jaccard's Index) among the leaf regions of different leaf ages ranged from 0.36 to 0.46, indicating a high spatial variation in the community of endophytic fungi inside the leaves. The high richness of endophytes in this host plant highlights a significant contribution of fungi to tropical biodiversity and the need for further research in this area.","J","Hilarino, MPA; Silveira, FADE; Oki, Y; Rodrigues, L; Santos, JC; Correa, A; Fernandes, GW; Rosa, CA",NA,"","","Amorim Hilarino, Mariana Patricia; de Oliveira e Silveira, Fernando Augusto; Oki, Yumi; Rodrigues, Leonardo; Santos, Jean Carlos; Correa Junior, Ary; Fernandes, Geraldo Wilson; Rosa, Carlos Augusto",NA,NA,"Distribution of the endophytic fungi community in leaves of Bauhinia brevipes (Fabaceae)","ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Santos, Jean Carlos/Y-6451-2019; Oki, Yumi/O-9295-2018; Fernandes, Geraldo/AAN-5602-2021; Santos, Jean/A-6528-2013; Silveira, Fernando A O/C-8157-2009","Santos, Jean Carlos/0000-0001-6031-9193; Fernandes, Geraldo/0000-0003-1559-6049; Santos, Jean/0000-0001-6031-9193; Silveira, Fernando/0000-0001-9700-7521",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0102-3306","1677-941X","",NA,NA,"OCT-DEC",2011,25,"4",NA,"","",NA,"815","821","","10.1590/S0102-33062011000400008","http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S0102-33062011000400008","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000299244800008","View Full Record in Web of Science",371,"Presence"
"Geophila repens (L.) I.M. Johnst (Rubiaceae) is a traditional medicinal plant used in Sri Lanka for the treatment of bacterial infections. Due to its rich endophytic fungi content, it was postulated that endophytically-produced specialized metabolites may be responsible for its purported antibacterial effects. To test this hypothesis, eight pure endophytic fungal cultures were isolated from G. repens then extracted and screened for antibacterial activity in a disc diffusion assay against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Large scale culturing, extraction, and purification of the most active fungal extract, obtained from Xylaria feejeensis, led to the isolation of 6 ',7 '-didehydrointegric acid (1), 13-carboxyintegric acid (2), and four known compounds including integric acid (3). Compound 3 was isolated as the key antibacterial component (MIC = 16 mu g/mL against Bacillus subtilis, 64 mu g/mL against Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus). Compound 3 and its analogues were devoid of hemolytic activity up to the highest tested concentration of 45 mu g/mL. This study demonstrates that specialized metabolites produced by endophytic fungi may contribute to the biological activity of some medicinal plants. Endophytic fungi should be evaluated as a potential source of antibiotics, especially from unexplored medicinal plants traditionally used for the treatment of bacterial infections.","J","Rajendran, S; Robertson, LP; Kosgahakumbura, L; Fernando, C; Göransson, U; Wang, HL; Hettiarachchi, C; Gunasekera, S",NA,"","","Rajendran, Sanjeevan; Robertson, Luke P.; Kosgahakumbura, Lakmini; Fernando, Chathurika; Goransson, Ulf; Wang, Helen; Hettiarachchi, Chamari; Gunasekera, Sunithi",NA,NA,"Antibacterial eremophilane sesquiterpenoids from Xylaria feejeensis, an endophytic fungi of the medicinal plant Geophila repens","FITOTERAPIA","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rajendran, Sanjeevan/HMD-8565-2023","Rajendran, Sanjeevan/0000-0002-7351-805X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0367-326X","1873-6971","",NA,NA,"JUN",2023,167,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","105496","10.1016/j.fitote.2023.105496","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fitote.2023.105496","","APR 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36990291,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000981474800001","View Full Record in Web of Science",372,"Presence"
"Endophytes are microorganisms that dwell within plant tissues by having a symbiotic association, one of the sources of secondary metabolites in plants. In this study, an attempt was made to isolate, characterize endophytic fungi, from leaves of Phyllanthus amarus Schum. and Thonn., and to screen the fungal fractions for hepatoprotective activity, followed by isolation of secondary metabolites from the endophytic fraction. An endophytic fungus, PALF-2 was identified as Nigrospora sp. CMH2 by molecular characterization. PALF-2 was fermented to get ethyl acetate (P2EA) and n butanol (P2nB) fractions. P2EA and P2nB were evaluated for hepatoprotective activity against paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity. Based on the activity, P2EA was subjected to column chromatography and analyzed by spectroscopic methods. P2EA and P2nB at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg reversed the elevated biochemical parameters as compared to CCl 4 treated groups. P2EA and P2nB restored endogenous enzyme levels. Chromatographic studies of P2EA led to the isolation of hypophyllanthin, phyllanthin, quercetin-3, 4di-O-glucoside, and kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, the structures were confirmed by spectroscopic analysis. LC-MS studies of the oil confirmed the presence of seven constituents. This is the first report on the isolation of these constituents from the endophytic fungus of P. amarus.

"This article describes isolation and pancreatic lipase (PL) inhibitory potential of 18 endophytic fungi isolated from the various parts of six indigenous medicinal plants. PL catalyzes absorption and hydrolysis of triglycerides into di-glycerides into mono-glycerides and free fatty acids. PL inhibitors are well-known for the disruption of pancreatic lipase activity. The quest for novel pancreatic lipase inhibitors is crucially important owing to their therapeutic potential in the treatment of obesity and related chronic diseases. The present dataset provides information about the presence of endophytic fungi in the internal tissues of selected plants and the PL inhibitory potential of their metabolites using bioassay based screening. Absence of the yellow zone surrounding the standard Orlistat and test extract indicated PL inhibition due to the cumulative effect of metabolites present in the extract. The data suggests that TLC bio-autographic method is simple, rapid and reproducible and therefore it could be effectively used for high throughput screening of PL inhibitors from natural sources.

"Background: The present study involves diversity and bioactivity of the endophytic fungal community from Catharanthus roseus inhabiting the coastal region. This study has been conducted hypothesizing that the microbial communities in the coastal regions would tolerate a range of abiotic stress such as salinity, humidity, temperature and soil composition, and it may produce new metabolites, which may possess bioactive property. Therefore in the current study, the cytotoxicity and free radical scavenging potential of the fungal organic extracts have been investigated. Moreover, the apoptotic and the antioxidant potential of the fungus that exhibited the best activity in preliminary screening has also been demonstrated. Results: Twenty endophytic fungal isolates were obtained from different parts of the plant, and identified using internal transcribed spacer region analysis. Based on the colonization frequency, the dominant genera were found to be Colletotrichum, Alternaria and Chaetomium with colonization frequency % of 8.66, 7.00 and 6.33, respectively. It was observed that the species diversity and richness was the highest in bark followed by leaf and stem regions of the plant. On screening the fungal ethyl acetate extracts for cytotoxicity against the HeLa cells, the Chaetomium nigricolor extract exhibited potent cytotoxic activity of 92.20% at 100 mu g mL(-1) concentration. Comparison between the different organic extracts (ethyl acetate, chloroform, dichloromethane and hexane) of Chaetomium nigricolor mycelial and culture filtrate, it was observed that the mycelial as well the culture filtrate ethyl acetate extracts and the culture filtrate hexane extract showed significant cytotoxic potential against the HeLa and MCF-7 cells, respectively. The apoptotic-and mitochondrial membrane depolarisation-induction potential of the Chaetomium nigricolor ethyl acetate extract has also been demonstrated in this study. Further the screening of antioxidant potential of the ethyl acetate fungal extracts using DPPH scavenging assay showed that Chaetomium nigricolor extract exhibited potential activity with a significant EC50 value of 22 mu g mL(-1). The ethyl acetate extract of Chaetomium nigricolor also exhibited superoxide radical scavenging potential. Conclusion: These results indicated that diverse endophytic fungal population inhabits Catharanthus roseus. One of the fungal isolate Chaetomium nigricolor exhibited significant cytotoxic, apoptotic and antioxidant potential.","J","Dhayanithy, G; Subban, K; Chelliah, J",NA,"","","Dhayanithy, Geethanjali; Subban, Kamalraj; Chelliah, Jayabaskaran",NA,NA,"Diversity and biological activities of endophytic fungi associated with Catharanthus roseus","BMC MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Subban, Kamalraj/0000-0003-2720-0697",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1471-2180","","",NA,NA,"JAN 21",2019,19,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","22","10.1186/s12866-019-1386-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12866-019-1386-x","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30665368,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000466957000004","View Full Record in Web of Science",375,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi are not only ubiquitous in plants, but also play an important role in the balancing of plant microecosystems. Numerous studies have shown that plant species and environment have a significant influence on the richness of endophytic fungi, and endophytic fungi often provide different forms of fitness benefits to their associated host plants. The present work aimed to isolate and identify endophytic fungi harboured in the tissues of the native medicinal plantCornus officinalisand screen beneficial fungi to inhibit cornel pathogens. A total of 208 strains were recovered from 720 tissue segments. The overall colonisation and isolation rates of endophytic fungi were 33.89% and 28.89%, with triennial twigs (53.33%, 55%) and fruits (6.67%, 3.33%) having the highest and lowest rates, respectively. On the basis of morphological characteristics and internal transcribed spacer sequence analysis, 183 isolates were classified into 13 genera. Amongst them,Alternaria,BotryosphaeriaandTalaromyceswere dominant communities, and their relative abundances were 31.25%, 26.92% and 10.10%, respectively. A detailed calculation of the Shannon diversity (H ' = 1.65) and Margalef's richness indices (Dmg = 2.30) revealed that the overall biodiversity of fungal endophytes inC. officinaliswas relatively high, with the stems harbouring the highest diversity. The antagonism assay of 75 representative endophytes on the four main fungal pathogens ofC. officinalisindicated that nine strains with antibiosis and eight strains with inhibition rate of more than 50% were obtained by the dual culture.

"Endophytic fungi are internal inhabitants of plant tissues that do not apparently cause harm to the host. Ecologically they provide a number of benefits to the plants by decreasing herbivory, increasing drought and disease resistance and enhancing the growth of plants. Endophytes have emerged as an exciting research topic as they have the potential to provide numerous metabolites with different biological activities. This study is focused on taxonomic novelties and new host or geographical records of endophytic fungi associated with Magnolia candolli collected from Yunnan Province, China and M. garrettii from Chiang Mai Province, Thailand. Magnolia plants are economically important and used in furniture, ornamental plants in gardens, temple trees, flowers for decorations and valuable medicine in China. In this study, 56 fungal endophytic isolates were obtained from Magnolia species, of which 54 belong to ascomycetes and two to basidiomycetes. The 56 endophytic fungal isolates were identified in 31 taxa that are distributed in eight orders, ten families, 13 genera, including eight new species (Colletotrichum chiangmaiense, C. xishuangbannaense, Coprinellus magnolia, Diaporthe chinensis, Epicoccum endophyticum, Letendraea magnoliae, Nigrospora magnoliae and Pestalotiopsis endophytica) and 23 new host and or geographical records. The results indicate that members of Sordariomycetes are dominant groups of endophytic fungi in Magnolia candolli and M. garrettii. Considering the total fungal endophytic isolates from Magnolia candolli and M. garrettii, Sordariomycetes comprises the the highest number of isolates of 82%, following Dothideomycetes 14% and Agaricomycetes 4%.

"AimTo explore the potential of Rosellinia sanctae-cruciana an endophytic fungus associated with Albizia lebbeck for pharmaceutically important cytotoxic compounds. Methods and ResultsOne novel cytochalasin, named jammosporin A (1) and four known analogues (2-5) were isolated from the culture of the endophytic fungus R. sanctae-cruciana, harboured from the leaves of the medicinal plant A. lebbeck. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analyses including one-dimensional and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance data along with MS data and by comparison with literature reports. In preliminary screening the ethyl acetate extract of the fungal culture was tested for cytotoxic activity against a panel of four cancer cell lines (MOLT-4, A549, MIA PaCa-2 and MDA-MB-231), and found to be active against MOLT-4 with an IC50 value of 10gml(-1). Owing to the remarkable cytotoxic activity of the extract the isolated compounds (1-5) were evaluated for their cytototoxicity against the MOLT-4 cell line by MTT assay. Interestingly, compounds 1-2, 4 and 5 showed considerable cytotoxic potential against the human leukaemia cancer cell line (MOLT-4) with IC50 values of 200, 100, 80 and 60moll(-1), respectively, while compound 3 showed an IC50 value of 25moll(-1). This is the first report of the existence of this class of secondary metabolites in R. sanctae-cruciana fungus. ConclusionThis study discovered a novel compound, named jammosporin A, isolated for the first time from R. sanctae-cruciana, an endophytic fungus of A. lebbeck with anticancer activity against the MOLT-4 cell line. Significance and Impact of the StudyRosellinia sanctae-cruciana represents an interesting source of a new compound with bioactive potential as a therapeutic agent against a human leukaemia cancer cell line (MOLT-4).","J","Sharma, N; Kushwaha, M; Arora, D; Jain, S; Singamaneni, V; Sharma, S; Shankar, R; Bhushan, S; Gupta, P; Jaglan, S",NA,"","","Sharma, N.; Kushwaha, M.; Arora, D.; Jain, S.; Singamaneni, V.; Sharma, S.; Shankar, R.; Bhushan, S.; Gupta, P.; Jaglan, S.",NA,NA,"New cytochalasin from Rosellinia sanctae-cruciana, an endophytic fungus of Albizia lebbeck","JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Shankar, Ravi/HSF-1169-2023","Jaglan, Sundeep/0000-0002-5691-7980; Shankar, Ravi/0000-0001-9428-0354; Sharma, Nisha/0000-0001-7674-5007; SINGAMANENI, VENUGOPAL/0000-0003-4655-5960; Jain, Shreyans K./0000-0001-6160-8755",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1364-5072","1365-2672","",NA,NA,"JUL",2018,125,"1",NA,"","",NA,"111","120","","10.1111/jam.13764","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.13764","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29573314,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000435274900009","View Full Record in Web of Science",381,"Presence"
"The main objective of this research work is to discover novel and efficient phytochemical substances from endophytic fungus found in medicinal plants. Curvularia geniculata L. (C. geniculata L.), an endophytic fungus isolated from Phyllanthus niruri L. (P. niruri L.), was tested against hepatoma cell lines (HepG2) in order to screen their antioxidant and anticancer potentials. The profiling of phytochemicals from the fungal extract was characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and molecular docking was done for the identified compounds against one of the potential receptors predominantly present in the hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines. Among the phytochemicals found, 2-methyl-7-phenylindole had the highest binding affinity (- 8.8 kcal mol(-1)) for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The stability of 2-methyl-7-phenylindole in the EGFR-binding pockets was tested using in silico molecular dynamics simulation. The fungal extract showed the highest antioxidant activity as measured by DPPH, ABTS radical scavenging, and FRAP assays. In vitro cytotoxicity assay of fungal extract demonstrated the concentration-dependent cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells after 24 h, and the IC50 (50% cell death) value was estimated to be 62.23 mu g mL(-1). Typical morphological changes such as condensation of nuclei and deformed membrane structures are indicative of ongoing apoptosis. The mitochondria of HepG2 cells were also targeted by the endophytic fungal extract, which resulted in substantial generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to the destruction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential integrity. These outcomes suggest that the ethyl acetate extract of C. geniculata L. has the potential to be an antioxidant agent and further to be exploited in developing potential anticancer agents.","J","Kalimuthu, AK; Parasuraman, P; Sivakumar, P; Murugesan, S; Arunachalam, S; Pandian, SRK; Ravishankar, V; Ammunje, DN; Sampath, M; Panneerselvam, T; Kunjiappan, S",NA,"","","Kalimuthu, Arjun Kumar; Parasuraman, Pavadai; Sivakumar, Pandian; Murugesan, Sankaranarayanan; Arunachalam, Sankarganesh; Pandian, Sureshbabu Ram Kumar; Ravishankar, Vigneshwaran; Ammunje, Damodar Nayak; Sampath, Muthukumar; Panneerselvam, Theivendran; Kunjiappan, Selvaraj",NA,NA,"In silico, in vitro screening of antioxidant and anticancer potentials of bioactive secondary metabolites from an endophytic fungus (Curvularia sp.) from Phyllanthus niruri L","ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pavadai, Parasuraman/AAF-5979-2019; Arunachalam, Sankarganesh/AAC-5702-2019; Theivendren, Panneerselvam/A-8117-2011; Pandian, Sureshbabu Ram Kumar/ABF-6543-2020; Pandian, Sivakumar/B-9367-2013; A, Damodar Nayak/AAF-6666-2019; S, Sathianarayanan/GQA-8699-2022","Pavadai, Parasuraman/0000-0002-0779-4750; Arunachalam, Sankarganesh/0000-0003-2857-4877; Theivendren, Panneerselvam/0000-0002-8197-4688; Pandian, Sureshbabu Ram Kumar/0000-0002-8458-4546; Pandian, Sivakumar/0000-0002-4469-4126; A, Damodar Nayak/0000-0002-3904-4700; S, Sathianarayanan/0000-0002-2279-2999; Ravishankar, Vigneshwaran/0000-0003-1017-6109; Kunjiappan, Selvaraj/0000-0002-6741-5118",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0944-1344","1614-7499","",NA,NA,"JUL",2022,29,"32",NA,"","",NA,"48908","48925","","10.1007/s11356-022-19249-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-19249-0","","FEB 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35201581,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000761870400003","View Full Record in Web of Science",382,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi associated with healthy leaf tissues of Cymbidium aloifolium was investigated for their antimicrobial and indole acetic acid (IAA) production potential. Altogether, 39 endophytic fungal isolates were obtained from the 150 surfaced sterilized inoculated leaf fragments. The dominant endophytic fungal genera were Colletotrichum, Rhizoctonia and Fusarium. Non-sporulating endophytic fungi were also isolated and categorized as morphotype. Among the fungi, the colonization frequency (CF%) of the genus Colletotrichum was found to be the highest. All the isolates were determined for antimicrobial and IAA activity. Amongst the isolates, an endophytic fungus, identified as Colletotrichum gleosporioides showed promising antimicrobial and IAA producing activity. The crude metabolite obtained from the fungus was characterized by GCMS and HPLC analyzes. GCMS chromatogram revealed presence of squalene, farnesol, indole-acetic acid, tryptophan and benzene-ethanol-4-hydroxy as major components. These compounds were reported to have significant bioactive properties. HPLC study revealed presence of IAA in the crude fungal extract.

"A total of 4,009 endophytic fungal isolates were recovered from healthy leaves, bark and xylem of Citrus sinensis in different seasons and age-classes. Corresponding to those factors, the majorities of fungal isolates were recovered from leaves, 2-yr-old trees and winter, respectively. Fungal isolates were initially categorized based on cultural and morphological characters, and representatives of each morphotype were subjected to molecular identifications based on ITS-rDNA and beta-tubulin sequences. All isolates obtained in this study belonged to the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota assigned to 30 fungal taxa. The most abundant fungal species were Alternaria spp. Species diversity indices of Margalef richness and Shannon-Wiener revealed a high diversity of fungal taxa recovered from leaf and during winter. Frequency (%) of fungal endophytes was highest in winter followed by summer, autumn, and spring significantly, whereas the corresponding sequence was winter, autumn, summer and spring for the diversity of endophytic fungi. Overall, the results of this study based on the community and diversity of endophytic fungal species in C. sinensis showed that the type of plant tissue, season of sampling and age of tree play a driving role on their abundance while their diversity was mainly dependent on the type of plant tissue, season of sampling than on the age of tree.","J","Juybari, HZ; Ghanbary, MAT; Rahimian, H; Karimi, K; Arzanlou, M",NA,"","","Juybari, Hakimeh Ziaie; Ghanbary, Mohammad Ali Tajick; Rahimian, Heshmatollah; Karimi, Kaivan; Arzanlou, Mahdi",NA,NA,"Seasonal, tissue and age influences on frequency and biodiversity of endophytic fungi of Citrus sinensis in Iran","FOREST PATHOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tajick Ghanbary, Mohammad Ali/HGE-4609-2022; Arzanlou/AAW-2768-2021; karimi, kaivan/P-6396-2016; karimi, kaivan/AAC-7975-2019","Tajick Ghanbary, Mohammad Ali/0000-0001-9360-8696; Arzanlou/0000-0001-6159-3629; karimi, kaivan/0000-0001-7142-2575; karimi, kaivan/0000-0001-7142-2575",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1437-4781","1439-0329","",NA,NA,"DEC",2019,49,"6",NA,"","",NA,"","","e12559","10.1111/efp.12559","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/efp.12559","","SEP 2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000487446600001","View Full Record in Web of Science",385,"Presence"
"The biodiversity of plant endophytic fungi is enormous, numerous competent endophytic fungi are capable of providing different forms of fitness benefits to host plants and also could produce a wide array of bioactive natural products, which make them a largely unexplored source of novel compounds with potential bioactivity. In this study, we provided a first insights into revealing the diversity of culturable endophytic fungi in Dongxiang wild rice (Oryza rufipogon Griff.) from China using rDNA-ITS phylogenetic analysis. Here, the potential of fungi in producing bioactive natural products was estimated based on the beta-ketosynthase detected in the polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster and on the bioassay of antagonistic activity against two rice phytopathogens Thanatephorus cucumeris and Xanthornonas oryzae. A total of 229 endophytic fungal strains were validated in 19 genera. Among the 24 representative strains, 13 strains displayedantagonistic activity against the phytopathogens. Furthermore, PKS genes were detected in 9 strains, indicating their potential for synthesising PKS compounds. Our study confirms the phylogenetic diversity of endophytic fungi in O. rufipogon G. and highlights that endophytic fungi are not only promising resources of biocontrol agents against phytopathogens of rice plants, but also of bioactive natural products and defensive secondary metabolites.

"Endophytic fungi from three commonly found seagrasses in southern Thailand were explored for their ability to produce antimicrobial metabolites. One hundred and sixty endophytic fungi derived from Cymodocea serrulata (Family Cymodoceaceae), Halophila ovalis and Thalassia hemprichii (Family Hydrocharitaceae) were screened for production of antimicrobial compounds by a colorimetric broth microdilution test against ten human pathogenic microorganisms including Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, a clinical isolate of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Escherichia coli ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Candida albicans ATCC 90028 and NCPF 3153, Cryptococcus neoformans ATCC 90112 and ATCC 90113 and clinical isolates of Microsporum gypseum and Penicillium marneffei. Sixty-nine percent of the isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity against at least one test strain. Antifungal activity was more pronounced than antibacterial activity. Among the active fungi, seven isolates including Hypocreales sp. PSU-ES26 from C. serrulata, Trichoderma spp. PSU-ES8 and PSU-ES38 from H. ovalis, and Penicillium sp. PSU-ES43, Fusarium sp. PSU-ES73, Stephanonectria sp. PSU-ES172 and an unidentified endophyte PSU-ES190 from T. hemprichii exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against human pathogens with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of less than 10 mu g/ml. The inhibitory extracts at concentrations of 4 times their MIC destroyed the targeted cells as observed by scanning electron microscopy.

"Dendrobium is the largest genus of tropical epiphytic orchid, some of which are traditional Chinese medicinal plants. The therapeutic components varied significantly among species. Endophytic microbes (fungi) hidden in medicinal plants may play an important effect on the overall quality of herb. Investigation of fungal composition in host plants is the first step toward elucidating the relationship endophyte-therapeutic content of herbal medicine. In this study, 401 culturable fungal endophytes were isolated and identified from 10 species of medicinal Dendrobium based on morphological and molecular techniques. The results showed that endophytic fungi from Dendrobium plants exhibited high biodiversity (37 genera, about 80 species). Acremonium, Alternaria, Ampelomyces, Bionectria, Cladosporium, Colletotrichum, Fusarium, Verticillium and Xylaria were the dominant fungal endophytes.

"Endophytic fungi associated with Pinus tabulaeformis Carr. were investigated in the Dongling Mountains of Beijing. A total of 16 200 tissue segments of P. tabulaeformis from four sample collections were processed, and 10 659 fungal isolates were recovered. The overall colonization and isolation rates of endophytic fungi from high to low were spring > winter > autumn > summer and in different tissues were bark > needle > xylem, irrespective of sampling seasons. The colonization rates of endophytic fungi of needles increased with age in the four sample collections. There were no significant differences of the colonization rates of endophytic fungi among 1-, 2-, and 3-year-old bark and xylem, except for significantly lower colonization rates in 1-year-old bark than in 2- and 3-year-old bark in summer. A similar trend of the isolation rates of endophytic fungi occurred. A total of 24 fungal taxa were recorded, of these five taxa Alternaria alternata, Leptostroma sp., Pestalotiopsis besseyi, Phoma lingam, and Phomopsis archeri, were consistently isolated as the common fungi in each sample collection.

"Endophytic fungi were isolated from healthy leaves of lndigofera suffruticosa Miller, a medicinal plant found in Brazil which is used in folk medicine to treat various diseases. Among 65 endophytic fungi isolated, 18 fungi showed activity against at least one tested microorganism in preliminary screening, and the best results were obtained with Nigrospora sphaerica (URM-6060) and Pestalotiopsis maculans (URM-6061). After fermentation in liquid media and in semisolid media, only N. sphaerica demonstrated antibacterial activity (in Potato Dextrose Broth-PDB and in semisolid rice culture medium). In the next step, a methanolic extract from rice culture medium (NsME) and an ethyl acetate extract (NsEAE) from the supernatant of PDB were prepared and both exhibited antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. The best result was observed against Staphylococcus aureus, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of 1.56 mg/mL and 6.25 mg/mL, respectively, for NsME and MIC and MBC values of 0.39 mg/mL and 3.12 mg/mL, respectively, for NsEAE.

"Salvia miltiorrhiza is one of the most commonly used medicinal materials in China. In recent years, the quality of S. miltiorrhiza has attracted much attention. Biotic and abiotic elicitors are widely used in cultivation to improve the quality of medicinal plants. We isolated an endophytic fungus, Mucor fragilis, from S. miltiorrhiza. We compared the effects of endophytic fungal elicitors with those of yeast extract together with silver ion, widely used together as effective elicitors, on S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots. Seventeen primary metabolites (amino acids and fatty acids) and five secondary metabolites (diterpenoids and phenolic acids) were analyzed after elicitor treatment. The mycelium extract promoted the accumulation of salvianolic acid B, rosmarinic acid, stearic acid, and oleic acid in S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots. Additionally, qPCR revealed that elicitors affect the accumulation of primary and secondary metabolites by regulating the expression of key genes (SmAACT, SmGGPPS, and SmPAL). This is the first detection of both the primary and secondary metabolites of S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots, and the results of this work should help guide the quality control of S. miltiorrhiza. In addition, the findings confirm that Mucor fragilis functions as an effective endophytic fungal elicitor with excellent application prospect for cultivation of medicinal plants.","J","Xu, WJ; Jin, XY; Yang, M; Xue, S; Luo, LL; Cao, XP; Zhang, CJ; Qiao, SY; Zhang, C; Li, JL; Wu, JH; Lv, LQ; Zhao, FY; Wang, N; Tan, ST; Lyu-Bu, AG; Wang, CG; Wang, XY",NA,"","","Xu, Wenjuan; Jin, Xiaoyan; Yang, Miao; Xue, Song; Luo, Linglong; Cao, Xupeng; Zhang, Caijuan; Qiao, Sanyang; Zhang, Chi; Li, Junling; Wu, Jiahui; Lv, Liqiao; Zhao, Fangyuan; Wang, Nan; Tan, Shuting; Lyu-Bu, A.

"Rhizospheric and endophytic fungi are key factors which influence plant fitness and soil fertility. Atractylodes macrocephala is one of the best-known perennial herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine. Continuous cropping has been shown to have a negative effect on its growth and renders it more susceptible to microbial pathogen attacks. In this study, we investigated the effects of continuous cropping on the endophytic and rhizospheric fungi associated withA. macrocephala using culture-independent Illumina MiSeq. Continuous cropping was found to decrease fungal diversity inside plant roots, stems, leaves and tubers. Additionally, we found that the structure and diversity of rhizospheric and endophytic fungal communities were altered by root-rot disease. Fusarium was overrepresented among root-rot rhizospheric and endophytic fungi, indicating that it has a major negative impact on plant health during A. macrocephala monocropping. Canonical correspondence analysis of the control and diseased samples revealed that pH, hydrolysis N, electrical conductivity and Hg content were well-correlated with fungal community composition during continuous cropping. Taken together, these results highlight the ecological significance of fungal communities in maintaining plant fitness and will guide the development strategies to attenuate the negative impacts of A. macrocephala continuous cropping.","J","Zhu, B; Wu, JJ; Ji, QY; Wu, W; Dong, SH; Yu, JY; Zhang, QY; Qin, LP",NA,"","","Zhu, Bo; Wu, Jianjun; Ji, Qingyong; Wu, Wei; Dong, Shihui; Yu, Jiayan; Zhang, Qiaoyan; Qin, Luping",NA,NA,"Diversity of rhizosphere and endophytic fungi in Atractylodes macrocephala during continuous cropping","PEERJ","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zhu, Bo/GOG-4717-2022; Dong, Shihui/T-4864-2017; Wu, Jian/AAU-5221-2020; Wu, Jian/AAU-5221-2020","Wu, Jian/0000-0001-9933-7364; Wu, Jian/0000-0002-3394-1507",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2167-8359","","",NA,NA,"APR 6",2020,8,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","e8905","10.7717/peerj.8905","http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8905","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32292655,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000523618200006","View Full Record in Web of Science",394,"Presence"

"Cancer is one of the most eminent diseases of modern times and a considerable natural products derived from medicinal plants have been identified as potential substances of antitumor drugs. In the present study, we prepared the biologically active component from fermentation broth of endophytic fungi and identified the endophytic fungi isolated from Dendrobium officinale as Ty5. We found that the extract, fraction of ethyl acetate, of metabolites could induce death of HepG2 cells. We performed MTT assay and flow cytometric assay to illustrate the effect of the compounds extracted through ethyl acetate on cancer cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay and Western blot assay were conducted to clarify the mechanism of the extract in cancer cell apoptosis. The results showed that extracts of the secondary metabolites obtained from ethyl acetate have a marked dose-dependent inhibitory effect on viability of HepG2 cells. Early and late apoptosis processes were displayed by flow cytometry (FCM). The ethyl acetate extract from metabolites of endophytic fungi was evaluated for anticancer activity and the extract displayed more potent cytotoxicity than the control associated with cell proliferation arrest.

"A CE method is described for the enantioselective analysis of propranolol (Prop) and 4-hydroxypropranolol (4-OH-Prop) in liquid Czapek medium with application in the study of the enantioselective biotransformation of Prop by endophytic fungi. The electrophoretic conditions previously optimized were as follows: an uncoated fused-silica capillary, 4%w/v carboxymethyl-beta-CD in 25 mmol/L triethylamine/phosphoric acid (H3PO4) buffer at pH 9 as running electrolyte and 17 kV of voltage. UV detection was carried out at 208 nm. Liquid-liquid extraction using diethyl ether: ethyl acetate (1:1 v/v) as extractor solvent was employed for sample preparation. The calibration curves were linear over the concentration range of 0.25-10.0 mu g/mL for each 4-OH-Prop enantiomer and 0.10-10.0 mu g/mL for each Prop enantiomer (r >= 0.995). Within-day and between-day relative standard deviations and relative errors for precision and accuracy were lower than 15% for all the enantiomers. Finally, the validated method was used to evaluate Prop biotransformation in its mammalian metabolite 4-OH-Prop by some selected endophytic fungi. The screening of five strains of endophytic fungi was performed and all of them could biotransform Prop to some extent. Specifically, Glomerella cingulata (VA1) biotransformed 47.8% of (-)-(S)-Prop to (-)-(S)-4-OH-Prop with no formation of (+)-(R)4-OH-Prop in 72 h of incubation.","J","Borges, KB; Pupo, MT; Bonato, PS",NA,"","","Borges, Keyller Bastos; Pupo, Monica Tallarico; Bonato, Pierina Sueli",NA,NA,"Enantioselective analysis of propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol by CE with application to biotransformation studies employing endophytic fungi","ELECTROPHORESIS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Borges, Keyller Bastos/A-7712-2012; Inbeqmedi, Inct/I-1929-2013; Pupo, Monica/D-8628-2012; 4, INCT/H-4499-2013","Borges, Keyller Bastos/0000-0003-1067-1919; Pupo, Monica/0000-0003-2705-0123;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0173-0835","1522-2683","",NA,NA,"NOV",2009,30,"22",NA,"","SI",NA,"3910","3917","","10.1002/elps.200900216","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.200900216","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19876961,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000272474900015","View Full Record in Web of Science",397,"Presence"
"The plant Pseudowintera colorata is well known for its antimicrobial and medicinal properties and is endemic to New Zealand. Using PCR-Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), we investigated the factors influencing the composition of endophytic fungal communities in P. colorata from ten distinct sites across New Zealand. Our results showed that plant organs of P. colorata influenced the diversity and richness of endophytic fungi (PERMANOVA, p < 0.05). In addition, plant maturity and its interactions revealed that endophytic fungal communities formed discrete clusters in leaves, stems, and roots of mature and immature P. colorata plants (PERMANOVA; p = 0.002, p = 0.001 and p = 0.039, respectively). For identifying isolates with biocontrol potential, dual culture tests were set up against four different phytopathogenic fungi. Isolates with high activity (zone of inhibition > 10 mm) were sequenced and identified as Trichoderma harzianum, Pezicula neosporulosa, Fusarium tricinctum, Metarhizium sp., and Chaetomium sp. Applying selected endophytic fungi (n = 7) as soil drenchers significantly increased the growth of P. colorata seedlings and produced more internodes. Seedling shoots treated with Trichoderma sp. PRY2BA21 were 2.2 x longer (8.36 cm) than the untreated controls (3.72 cm). Our results elucidate the main plant factors influencing fungal community composition and demonstrate a role for endophytic fungi in P. colorata growth and further demonstrate that medicinal plants are a rich source of endophytes with potential as biocontrol agents.","J","Purushotham, N; Jones, E; Monk, J; Ridgway, H",NA,"","","Purushotham, Neeraj; Jones, Eirian; Monk, Jana; Ridgway, Hayley",NA,NA,"Fungal Communities in the Native New Zealand Medicinal Plant Pseudowintera colorata (Horopito) Are Determined by Plant Organ Type and Host Maturity with Key Members Promoting Plant Growth","MICROORGANISMS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"; Jones, Eirian/K-6721-2012","Purushotham, Neeraj/0000-0002-4435-4340; Jones, Eirian/0000-0002-1879-4537",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2076-2607","",NA,NA,"DEC",2021,9,"12",NA,"","",NA,"","","2576","10.3390/microorganisms9122576","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9122576","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34946177,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000735940700001","View Full Record in Web of Science",398,"Presence"
"The association of plant with microorganisms, such as dark septate endophytic fungi, has mitigated the harmful effects of chemical, physical, and biological agents on the host. The objective of this work was to evaluate the interaction of the dark septate endophytic fungi with cowpea plants under salt stress. Endophytic fungi were isolated from Vochysia divergens root system, and molecular identification of fungi was performed by sequencing the ITS region. We selected and identified Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and Melanconiella elegans-21W2 for their ability to infect V. divergens root in vitro with development of typical dark septate fungi structures. Cowpea plants-inoculated or not inoculated with Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and M. elegans 21W2-were cultivated in 5-L pots under greenhouse conditions and submitted to four different electrical conductivities of irrigation water (1.2, 2.2, 3.6, and 5.0 dS m(-1)). The salinity caused decrease in leaf concentration of K and increased leaf concentration of calcium, sodium, and chlorine; and no influence of dark septate endophytic fungi was observed in these responses. On the other hand, root colonization with Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and M. elegans 21W2 resulted in improved nutrition with N and P in cowpea under salt stress, favoring the growth and rate of liquid photosynthesis.

"Pepper yellow leaf curl disease caused by Pepper yellow leaf curl virus becomes a major problem on chilli pepper in Indonesia since 1999. Endophytic fungi has the potency to suppress plant diseases by acting as induced resistant agent. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of endophytic fungi application on incidence of yellow leaf curl disease of chilli pepper. Four isolates of endophytic fungi, i.e. Cercospora nicotianae isolate H5, Curvularia sp. isolate H12, Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 and AC-4.5 were applied as seed treatment and leaf spray on 2 chilli varieties, 'Biola' and 'Luwes'. Observations of incubation period showed that delayed symptom occurred on application of Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 and Curvularia sp. isolate H12. Disease incidence reached 100 % in all treatments. Less severe symptom was observed on application of Curvularia sp. isolate H12. Most plants infected by PYLCIV showed obvious symptoms of yellow mosaic, leaf curling and stunting. Plant productivity analysis showed that application of Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 resulted higher fruit weight and this treatment may induce tolerant response of the plants to PYLCIV infection. Initial effort to evaluate endophytic fungi as biocontrol agents for pepper yellow leaf curl disease should be studied further.","J","Lestari, SM; Hidayat, H; Widodo, W",NA,"","","Lestari, Susanti Mugi; Hidayat, Hendrastuti; Widodo, Widodo",NA,NA,"Determination of Endophytic Fungi as Induce Resistance Agent of Chilli Pepper Against Pepper Yellow Leaf Curl Disease","AGRIVITA","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Widodo, Widodo/AIB-4133-2022; WIDODO, WIDODO/JGL-6847-2023; Lestari, Susanti Mugi/JKH-8021-2023; Widodo, Widodo/GPW-6341-2022","Widodo, Widodo/0000-0001-5479-6815; Mugi Lestari, Susanti/0000-0003-0722-8545",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0126-0537","","",NA,NA,"JUN",2018,40,"2",NA,"","",NA,"249","256","","10.17503/agrivita.v40i2.989","http://dx.doi.org/10.17503/agrivita.v40i2.989","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000438777200008","View Full Record in Web of Science",403,"Presence"
"Epigenetic regulation plays a critical role in controlling fungal secondary metabolism. Here, we report the pleiotropic effects of the epigenetic regulator HdaA (histone deacetylase) on secondary metabolite production and the associated biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) expression in the plant endophytic fungusPenicillium chrysogenumFes1701. Deletion of thehdaAgene in strain Fes1701 induced a significant change of the secondary metabolite profile with the emergence of the bioactive indole alkaloid meleagrin. Simultaneously, more meleagrin/roquefortine-related compounds and less chrysogine were synthesized in the Delta hdaAstrain. Transcriptional analysis of relevant gene clusters in Delta hdaAand wild strains indicated that disruption ofhdaAhad different effects on the expression levels of two BGCs: the meleagrin/roquefortine BGC was upregulated, while the chrysogine BGC was downregulated. Interestingly, transcriptional analysis demonstrated that different functional genes in the same BGC had different responses to the disruption ofhdaA. Thereinto, theroqOgene, which encodes a key catalyzing enzyme in meleagrin biosynthesis, showed the highest upregulation in the Delta hdaAstrain (84.8-fold). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the upregulation of HdaA inactivation on meleagrin/roquefortine alkaloid production in the endophytic fungusP. chrysogenum. Our results suggest that genetic manipulation based on the epigenetic regulator HdaA is an important strategy for regulating the productions of secondary metabolites and expanding bioactive natural product resources in endophytic fungi.","J","Ding, Z; Zhou, HB; Wang, X; Huang, HM; Wang, HT; Zhang, RY; Wang, ZP; Han, J",NA,"","","Ding, Zhuang; Zhou, Haibo; Wang, Xiao; Huang, Huiming; Wang, Haotian; Zhang, Ruiyan; Wang, Zhengping; Han, Jun",NA,NA,"Deletion of the Histone Deacetylase HdaA in Endophytic Fungus Penicillium chrysogenum Fes1701 Induces the Complex Response of Multiple Bioactive Secondary Metabolite Production and Relevant Gene Cluster Expression","MOLECULES","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"He, Chen/JLM-5059-2023; Liu, Shao/JFK-0166-2023; zhang, rui/HZI-0079-2023; Zhang, Ruiyan/HHC-5329-2022; JIN, LIYING/JFB-1980-2023","Zhou, Haibo/0000-0001-9656-6479; Ding, Zhuang/0000-0002-0227-692X; Han, Jun/0000-0001-9224-0033",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1420-3049","",NA,NA,"AUG",2020,25,"16",NA,"","",NA,"","","3657","10.3390/molecules25163657","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules25163657","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32796640,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000577775800001","View Full Record in Web of Science",404,"Presence"
"The endophytic niches of plants are a rich source of microbes that can directly and indirectly promote plant protection, growth and development. The diversity of culturable endophytic fungi from stems and branches of Theobroma cacao (cacao) and Theobroma grandiflorum (cupuacu) trees growing in the Amazon region of Brazil was assessed. The collection of fungal endophytic isolates obtained was applied in field experiments to evaluate their potential as biocontrol agents against Phytophthora palmivora, the causal agent of the black-pod rot disease of cacao, one of the most important pathogens in cocoa-producing regions worldwide. The isolated endophytic fungi from 60 traditional, farmer-planted, healthy cacao and 10 cupuacu plants were cultured in PDA under conditions inducing sporulation. Isolates were classified based upon the morphological characteristics of their cultures and reproductive structures. Spore suspensions from a total of 103 isolates that could be classified at least up to genus level were tested against P. palmivora in pods attached to cacao trees in the field. Results indicated that similar to 70% of isolates showed biocontrol effects to a certain extent, suggesting that culturable endophytic fungal biodiversity in this system is of a mostly mutualistic type of interaction with the host. Eight isolates from genera Trichoderma (reference isolate), Pestalotiopsis, Curvularia, Tolypocladium and Fusarium showed the highest level of activity against the pathogen, and were further characterized. All demonstrated their endophytic nature by colonizing axenic cacao plantlets, and confirmed their biocontrol activity on attached pods trials by showing significant decrease in disease severity in relation to the positive control. None, however, showed detectable growth-promotion effects. Aspects related to endophytic biodiversity and host-pathogen-endophyte interactions in the environment of this study were discussed on the context of developing sustainable strategies for biological control of black-pod rot of cacao.

"Microorganisms interact with each other via metabolic exchange. Several studies have revealed that microbial metabolites may act as mediators of microbial interactions. During our previous work with endophytes isolated from the Brazilian medicinal plant Lychnophora ericoides, we demonstrated that the well-known antifungal compound amphotericin B, produced by the endophytic actinobacterium Streptomyces albospinus RLe7, may trigger chemical responses in endophytic fungi. In this study, we cultured endophytic fungi in amphotericin B-enriched media to verify whether other chemical responses could be induced. Interestingly, one fungal strain showed a differential response under the tested conditions. When the fungus Xylaria cubensis FLe9 was cultured in amphotericin B-enriched media, a mycelial guttate was observed. Investigation of the fungal extracts from X. cubensis FLe9 and purification of fungal metabolites were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a diode array detector. Isolated compounds were characterized on the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry data. Therefore, we report on the overproduction of the fungal metabolites griseofulvin (1) and dechlorogriseofulvin (2) when the endophytic fungus Xylaria cubensis FLe9 was exposed to amphotericin B. Both fungal compounds 1 and 2 were also detected in the mycelial guttate produced when X. cubensis FLe9 was exposed to amphotericin B. Since the amphotericin B-producing actinobacterium S. albospinus RLe7 and the griseofulvin-producing fungus X. cubensis FLe9 are endophytes from the same host, biosynthetic induction of fungal compounds may suggest a potential signaling role for amphotericin B in natural environments. However, this hypothesis needs to be further investigated in field experiments.","J","Caraballo-Rodríguez, AM; Mayor, CA; Chagas, FO; Pupo, MT",NA,"","","Caraballo-Rodriguez, Andres M.; Mayor, Cassia A.; Chagas, Fernanda O.; Pupo, Monica T.",NA,NA,"Amphotericin B as an inducer of griseofulvin-containing guttate in the endophytic fungus Xylaria cubensis FLe9","CHEMOECOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Chagas, Fernanda/V-6059-2019; Pupo, Monica/D-8628-2012; Chagas, Fernanda Oliveira/P-2589-2016; Chagas, Fernanda/GYV-0091-2022; Caraballo-Rodriguez, Andres Mauricio/ADB-1204-2022; Chagas, Fernanda Oliveira/GYV-0042-2022","Chagas, Fernanda/0000-0001-9534-3521; Pupo, Monica/0000-0003-2705-0123; Chagas, Fernanda Oliveira/0000-0001-9534-3521; Caraballo-Rodriguez, Andres Mauricio/0000-0001-5499-2728; Chagas, Fernanda Oliveira/0000-0001-9534-3521",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0937-7409","1423-0445","",NA,NA,"OCT",2017,27,"5",NA,"","",NA,"177","185","","10.1007/s00049-017-0243-3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00049-017-0243-3","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000409558400001","View Full Record in Web of Science",407,"Presence"

"Endophytic fungi are the endogenous micro-organisms to interacting with the plant cells, which do not exhibit any symptoms on the host plant and may produce some of the main secondary metabolites of the host plant cells. Ferula assa-foetida is a perennial and endemic medicinal plant of Iran, which is a rich source of sesquiterpene, coumarins, polysulfides and phenolic acids.

"Lawn grass (Axonopus compressus) is a widely distributed grass species from the family Poaceae that is ubiquitous in Malaysia. We isolated endophytic fungi from the leaves of A. compressus and molecularly identified them as Fusarium parceramosum, Colletotrichum siamense, C. gigasporum, C. endophyticum, Curvularia lunata, Stagonospora bicolor, Calonectria gracilis, and Albifimbria verrucari. These fungal endophytes are considered host generalists, as they have been isolated from other plants and have also been reported to be latent plant pathogens. We tested the pathogenicity of selected endophytic fungal isolates on A. compressus leaves, chili (Capsicum annum), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and found that they were pathogenic to wounded A. compressus leaves with low to moderate virulence, and several were pathogenic to wounded and unwounded chili and tomato fruits. This indicated that the endophytes could infect both vegetable fruits with low to very high virulence. Pathogenicity tests demonstrated that endophytic fungi from the leaves of A. compressus can become pathogenic and infect the host and other plant species. The findings also indicated that leaves of A. compressus may harbor pathogens with latent ability that can become active due to changes in environmental conditions, thereby disrupting the balance between host-endophyte antagonism.","J","Azuddin, NF; Azmy, MSMN; Zakaria, L",NA,"","","Azuddin, Nurul Farizah; Azmy, Mohamad Syahril Mohamad Noor; Zakaria, Latiffah",NA,NA,"Molecular identification of endophytic fungi in lawn grass (Axonopus compressus) and their pathogenic ability","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Azuddin, Nurul Farizah/AAV-7012-2021","Azuddin, Nurul Farizah/0000-0002-3638-3993",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2045-2322","","",NA,NA,"MAR 14",2023,13,"1",NA,"","",NA,"","","4239","10.1038/s41598-023-31291-7","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31291-7","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36918601,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000984342100025","View Full Record in Web of Science",410,"Presence"
"Medicinal plants of the genus Hypericum are rich sources of bioactive naphthodianthrones, which are unique in the plant kingdom, but quite common in fungal endophytes. Cultivable endophytic fungi were isolated from 14 different Hypericum spp. originating from seeds grown under in vitro conditions and further acclimated to outdoor conditions. Among 37 fungal isolates yielded from the aerial and underground plant organs, 25 were identified at the species level by the fungal bar-code marker internal transcribed spacer rDNA and protein-coding gene region of tef1 alpha. Ten of them were isolated from Hypericum spp. for the first time. The axenic cultures of the isolated endophytes were screened for the production of extracellular enzymes, as well as bioactive naphthodianthrones and their putative precursors by Borntrager's test and HPLC-HRMS. Traces of naphthodianthrones and their intermediates, emodin, emodin anthrone, skyrin, or pseudohypericin, were detected in the fungal mycelia of Acremonium sclerotigenum and Plectosphaerella cucumerina isolated from Hypericum perforatum and Hypericum maculatum, respectively. Traces of emodin, hypericin, and pseudohypericin were released in the broth by Scedosporium apiospermum, P. cucumerina, and Fusarium oxysporum during submerged fermentation.

"Aims Alzheimer's disease is considered one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders and dementia is the core symptom of this disease. This study was aimed to test the bioactive compounds produced by endophytic fungus for the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and to identify the compound responsible for this activity. Methods and Results Endophytic fungi were isolated from the medicinal plant Tinospora cordifolia and screened for AChE inhibition and antioxidant activity. The extract of one of the isolates Nigrospora oryzae (GL15) showed maximum AChE inhibition as well as antioxidant activity. The compound responsible for AChE inhibition (fraction 3) was identified as quercetin based on UV, FTIR spectra, HPLC and ESI-MS analyses. Furthermore, the identification of quercetin in the extract of fraction 3 was confirmed by H-1 NMR analysis. This extract showed anti-dementia-like activity in scopolamine (SCO) model. The minimal effective dose of the extract of fraction 3 modulated the SCO-provoked cognitive deficits such as impairments in spatial recognition memory and latency period in Y-maze test and passive avoidance test, respectively. The SCO-induced modulation in cholinergic pathway was ameliorated by the extract of N. oryzae in hippocampus, resulting in decrease in AChE activity and restoration of cytoarchitecture of hippocampus.

"Dendrobium catenatum, which belongs to the Orchidaceae family, has been used as a traditional medicine and healthy food in China for over 2000 years, and is of enormous economic value. Polysaccharides and flavonoids are two major functional ingredients in D. catenatum stems that contribute to its health benefits. D. catenatum lives in close association with endophytic fungi, but the literature regarding the further relations between them, especially the fungal-induced accumulation of metabolites in the host plant, is sparse. Our previous study showed that Pestalotiopsis sp. DO14 isolated from D. catenatum improved the host plant growth and metabolite accu-mulation. This study was performed to investigate dynamic variations of the growth traits, key metabolites (polysaccharides and flavonoids), and expression of key genes of D. catenatum under conditions of the DO14 colonization. Colonization with DO14 promoted D. catenatum growth as indicated by increased leaf area, mid-stem thickness, and plant height. The content of polysaccharides, mannose, and sucrose increased even without DO14 entering the host cells or forming a mature symbiotic relationship concurrent with improved photosynthesis rate. Furthermore, DO14 induced upregulation of genes involved in sugar and flavonoid meta-bolism, especially phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCKA), chalcone synthase (CHS) and UDP-glycose flavonoid glycosyltransferase (UFGT). These observations suggested that endophytic fungi induce the accumulation of polysaccharides and flavonoids by plants, increasing the efficiency of carbon assimilation and carbon turnover. The findings of this study provide insight into the mechanisms underlying Orchidaceae-endophyte interactions, and suggest potential novel applications of endophytic fungi in D. catenatum breeding to improved plant quality.","J","Chen, XL; Wang, SY; Farag, MA; Han, ZG; Chen, DH; Zhang, XF; Si, JP; Wu, LS",NA,"","","Chen, Xueliang; Wang, Shuyuan; Farag, Mohamed A.; Han, Zhigang; Chen, Donghong; Zhang, Xinfeng; Si, Jinping; Wu, Lingshang",NA,NA,"Interactions between endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis sp.

"Growing data suggest that Aspergillus niger, an endophytic fungus, is a rich source of natural compounds with a wide range of biological properties. This study aimed to examine the antimicrobial and antibiofilm capabilities of the Phragmites australis-derived endophyte against a set of pathogenic bacteria and fungi. The endophytic fungus Aspergillus sp. AP5 was isolated from the leaves of P. australis. The chemical profile of the fungal crude extract was identified by spectroscopic analysis using LC-HRESIMS. The fungal-derived extract was evaluated for its antimicrobial activity towards a set of pathogenic bacterial and fungal strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella sp., Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger. Moreover, antibiofilm activity toward four resistant biofilm-forming bacteria was also evaluated. Additionally, a neural-networking pharmacophore-based visual screening predicted the most probable bioactive compounds in the obtained extract. The AP5-EtOAc extract was found to have potent antibacterial activities against S. aureus, E. coli, and Klebsiella sp., while it exhibited low antibacterial activity toward P. Vulgaris and P. aeruginosa and displayed anticandidal activity. The AP5-EtOAc extract had significant antibiofilm activity in S. aureus, followed by P. aeruginosa.

"This study was aimed to investigate whether host plant species and lifestyles, and environmental conditions in the desert affect endophytic fungi composition. Endophytic fungal communities from parasitic plant Cynomorium songaricum and its host Nitraria tangutorum were investigated from three sites including Tonggu Naoer, Xilin Gaole, and Guazhou in Tengger and Badain Jaran Deserts in China using the next-generation sequencing of a ribosomal RNA gene region. Similarity and difference in endophytic fungal composition from different geographic locations were evaluated through multivariate statistical analysis. It showed that plant genetics was a deciding factor affecting endophytic fungal composition even when C. songaricum and N. tangutorum grow together tightly. Not only that, the fungal composition was also greatly affected by the local environment and rainfall. However, the distribution and richness of fungal species indicated that the geographical distance exerted little influence on characterizing the fungal composition. Overall, the findings suggested that plant species, parasitic or non-parasitic lifestyles of the plant, and local environment strongly affected the number and diversity of the endophytic fungal species, which may provide valuable insights into the microbe ecology, symbiosis specificity, and the tripartite relationship among parasitic plant, host, and endophytic fungi, especially under desert environment.","J","Miao, SM; Zhang, YY; Cui, JL; Zhang, G",NA,"","","Miao, Shuang-Man; Zhang, Yan-Yan; Cui, Jin-Long; Zhang, Gang",NA,NA,"Species and geographic specificity between endophytic fungi and host supported by parasitic Cynomorium songaricum and its host Nitraria tangutorum distributed in desert","ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Cui, Jin-Long/0000-0001-5050-3384",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0302-8933","1432-072X","",NA,NA,"JUL",2021,203,"5",NA,"","",NA,"2511","2519","","10.1007/s00203-021-02224-7","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-021-02224-7","","MAR 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33677636,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000625925300004","View Full Record in Web of Science",416,"Presence"
"Previous studies on the mechanisms of birch resistance to herbivores and foliar micro-fungi (both pathogenic and endophytic) have focused mainly on the role of internal leaf chemistry. In the present study, we examined genetic correlations between leaf surface traits (glandular trichome density and total concentrations of surface flavonoid aglycones) and occurrence of three species of foliar micro-fungi, one pathogenic rust (Melampsoridium betulinum) and two endophytic fungi (Fusicladium sp. and Melanconium sp.), and performance of autumnal moth larvae (Epirrita autumnata) in two birch species, Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii and B. pendula. The performance of autumnal moth larvae on B. pubescens ssp. czerepanovii was negatively correlated with density of glandular trichomes (RGR: r=-0.855; pupal mass: r=-0.709). In addition, rust infection was negatively correlated with trichome density in B. pendula (r=-0.675) and with epicuticular flavonoid aglycones in B. pubescens ssp. czerepanovii (r=-0.855). The frequency of the endophytic fungus Fusicladium sp., was related to epicuticular flavonoid aglycones (r=-0.782), while another endophytic fungus, Melanconium sp., showed no associations with any of the studied variables in B. pubescens ssp. czerepanovii. Our results indicate that leaf surface traits may be at least as important determinants of herbivore performance and micro-fungi abundance in birch as leaf internal chemistry.","J","Valkama, E; Koricheva, J; Salminen, JP; Helander, M; Saloniemi, I; Saikkonen, K; Pihlaja, K",NA,"","","Valkama, E; Koricheva, J; Salminen, JP; Helander, M; Saloniemi, I; Saikkonen, K; Pihlaja, K",NA,NA,"Leaf surface traits: overlooked determinants of birch resistance to herbivores and foliar micro-fungi?","TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Saloniemi, Irma/C-8893-2011; Koricheva, Julia/G-6754-2011; Valkama, Elena/ABB-4520-2021; Salminen, Juha-Pekka/N-3313-2017","Koricheva, Julia/0000-0002-9033-0171; Valkama, Elena/0000-0002-8337-8070; Salminen, Juha-Pekka/0000-0002-2912-7094; Saikkonen, Kari/0000-0001-5203-9984; Helander, Marjo/0000-0002-9759-4321",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0931-1890","1432-2285","",NA,NA,"MAR",2005,19,"2",NA,"","",NA,"191","197","","10.1007/s00468-004-0380-5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00468-004-0380-5","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000226912200009","View Full Record in Web of Science",417,"Presence"
"Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide, with an increasing number of cases being reported annually. The elevated rate of mortality necessitates a global challenge to explore newer sources of anticancer drugs. Recent advancements in cancer treatment involve the discovery and development of new and improved chemotherapeutics derived from natural or synthetic sources. Natural sources offer the potential of finding new structural classes with unique bioactivities for cancer therapy. Endophytic fungi represent a rich source of bioactive metabolites that can be manipulated to produce desirable novel analogs for chemotherapy. This review offers a current and integrative account of clinically used anticancer drugs such as taxol, podophyllotoxin, camptothecin, and vinca alkaloids in terms of their mechanism of action, isolation from endophytic fungi and their characterization, yield obtained, and fungal strain improvement strategies. It also covers recent literature on endophytic fungal metabolites from terrestrial, mangrove, and marine sources as potential anticancer agents and emphasizes the findings for cytotoxic bioactive compounds tested against specific cancer cell lines.","J","Uzma, F; Mohan, CD; Hashem, A; Konappa, NM; Rangappa, S; Kamath, PV; Singh, BP; Mudili, V; Gupta, VK; Siddaiah, CN; Chowdappa, S; Alqarawi, AA; Abd Allah, EF",NA,"","","Uzma, Fazilath; Mohan, Chakrabhavi D.; Hashem, Abeer; Konappa, Narasimha M.; Rangappa, Shobith; Kamath, Praveen V.; Singh, Bhim P.; Mudili, Venkataramana; Gupta, Vijai K.; Siddaiah, Chandra N.; Chowdappa, Srinivas; Alqarawi, Abdulaziz A.; Abd Allah, Elsayed F.",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungi-Alternative Sources of Cytotoxic Compounds: A Review","FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rangappa, Shobith/AAI-2169-2020; Mohan, Chakrabhavi Dhananjaya/AGO-1276-2022; Singh, Bhim Pratap/G-7268-2016; Abd_Allah, Elsayed Fathi/N-6846-2017; Hashem, Abeer/AAX-5952-2021; Gupta, Vijai Kumar/O-2445-2014","Rangappa, Shobith/0000-0002-9800-7192; Singh, Bhim Pratap/0000-0002-9911-4125; Abd_Allah, Elsayed Fathi/0000-0002-8509-8953; Hashem, Abeer/0000-0001-6541-347X; Gupta, Vijai Kumar/0000-0003-1565-5918; Mohan, Chakrabhavi Dhananjaya/0000-0002-6810-9219; ALQARAWI, ABDULAZIZ/0000-0002-2027-694X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1663-9812","",NA,NA,"APR 26",2018,9,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","309","10.3389/fphar.2018.00309","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2018.00309","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29755344,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000430951900001","View Full Record in Web of Science",418,"Review"

"Endophytic fungi are capable of increasing the growth and secondary metabolite production of medicinal plants in an ecofriendly and sustainable manner. Although these responses have been demonstrated in many plant species, they are not well understood in the medicinal plant Bletilla striata (Thunb.) Reichb.F.. Co -culture of B.striata with three endofungal isolates was carried out to evaluate the effects of endophytic fungal interaction on the plant growth and accumulation of phenols. The plant growth-promoting traits of isolated fungi were investigated, and the isolates had the ability to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), siderophore and cellulolytic enzyme. The fungal strain Byssochlamys spectabilis 1-N2 co-cultured with plantlets of B. striata significantly increased certain growth properties, including shoot length by 71.40%, pseudobulbs dry weight by 52.58%, number of new roots by 5.25-fold, pseudobulbs diameter by 30.94% and improved the total phenolic content of the medicinal part by 25.41%. The fungal polysaccharide elicitor prepared from B. spectabilis 1-N2 mycelium also altered the accumulation of total phenolic content at different time points. Polysaccharide elicitor treatment significantly enhanced the accumulation of nitric oxide (NO) and salicylic acid (SA), which are involved in the plant defence response and significantly upregulated the activities of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) and tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL). The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of B. striata and endophytic fungi interactions and provide vital information for the use of endophytic fungi to improve plant growth and active component accumulation in B.striata cultivation.

"As compared to organic farming system, conventional farming system relies on higher inputs of synthetic agrochemicals, which may reduce the abundance, diversity, and beneficial effects of plant endophytic fungal communities. This study compares the diversity and abundance of culturable endophytic fungal communities associated with four plant species - corn, tomato, pepper, and watermelon grown in separate organic and conventional fields. In all, 740 fungal isolates were identified, of which 550 were from the organic fields and 190 from the conventional ones. These fungal isolates were grouped into eight orders and 22 species, with the two most abundant species being Trichoderma sp. and Pichia guilliermondi. The fungal species diversity and abundance were both significantly higher in the organic than in the conventional fields. All the isolated endophytic fungi improved tomato plants' shoot growth and biomass significantly, as compared with the water control. Six fungal isolates also exhibited activity that enhanced tomato fruit yields. These results suggest that these endophytic fungi might be a considerable boost to sustainable agricultural production, while also reducing the agricultural application of chemicals and thus benefiting the environment and human health.","J","Xia, Y; Sahib, MR; Amna, A; Opiyo, SOB; Zhao, ZZ; Gao, YG",NA,"","","Xia, Ye; Sahib, Mohammad Radhi; Amna, Amna; Opiyo, Stephen O.

"Podophyllotoxin, a naturally occurring aryl tetralin lignan produced by few plant species and endophytic fungi is used as precursor for the chemical synthesis of the anticancer drugs. In the present study, for the isolation of podophyllotoxin producing endophytic fungi 30 plant (Podophyllum hexandrum) samples were collected from different localities of Pakistan. About 261 fungal strains isolated, among them 22 strains had the ability to produce podophyllotoxin. Maximum podophyllotoxin production (88.14 mu g/ml) was shown by fungal strain P-18, which was later identified as Penicillium sp. through 18S rRNA gene sequencing. Optimum growth conditions and parameters such as fermentation medium, pH, temperature, inoculum size, carbon and nitrogen sources were optimized to attain maximum production of podophyllotoxin. The maximum production of 566.23 mu g/ml was achieved with yeast extract sucrose broth medium with 15% and 5% supplementation of glucose and peptone as carbon and nitrogen source, respectively at pH 5.5 and temperature 25 degrees C.

"Endophytic fungi are ubiquitous organisms found in the plants, residing intercellular or intracellular, at least for a portion of their lives without causing apparent symptoms of infection. Almost all plants are known to harbor endophytes. The choice of the plant to be used for exploring endophytes for bioactives is important. Therefore, medicinal plants which are known to be used since centuries as an alternative source of medicine, are a valuable source for bioprospecting endophytes. Nevertheless, due to many reasons there is a dire need for novel resources for novel drugs which can be an answer to many deadly diseases. It is in this context that the present review was envisaged. The review reveals the importance of endophytic fungi from medicinal plants as a source of bioactive and chemically novel compounds. The bioactive metabolites produced by endophytic fungi originate from different biosynthetic pathways and belong to diverse structural groups such as terpenoids, steroids, quinones, phenols, coumarins etc. Endophytes therefore, represent a chemical reservoir for new compounds such as, anticancer, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, antiparasitic, antiviral, antitubercular, insecticidal etc. for use in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Although, efforts have been made to accommodate as many examples as possible but the depth of the subject is so vast that it cannot be covered in one single review. This in itself speaks of the fact that endophytic fungi from medicinal plants is indeed a treasure worth searching. In the present review only some selected examples have been covered.","J","Kaul, S; Gupta, S; Ahmed, M; Dhar, MK",NA,"","","Kaul, Sanjana; Gupta, Suruchi; Ahmed, Maroof; Dhar, Manoj K.",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi from medicinal plants: a treasure hunt for bioactive metabolites","PHYTOCHEMISTRY REVIEWS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1568-7767","1572-980X","",NA,NA,"DEC",2012,11,"4",NA,"","SI",NA,"487","505","","10.1007/s11101-012-9260-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11101-012-9260-6","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000317742500011","View Full Record in Web of Science",426,"Review"
"Purpose: To evaluate in situ macroporous resin adsorption for enhancement of palmarumycins C-12 and C-13 production in mycelial liquid culture of the endophytic fungus Berkleasmium sp. Dzf12. Methods: Ten macroporous adsorption resins (D-101, D1300, HPD-100, X-5, AB-8, DM130, ADS-17, DA-201, NKA-9 and S-8) were tested for absorption of palmarumycins C12 and C13 in mycelial liquid culture of the endophytic fungus Berkleasmium sp. Dzf12. Results: Among the resins, DA-201 showed the most significant enhancing effect on accumulation of palmarumycins C12 and C13 in mycelial liquid culture of endophytic fungus Berkleasmium sp. Dzf12. When resin DA-201 was applied to the medium at a concentration of 4.17 % on day 11 and then harvested on day 15, the maximal yield of palmarumycins C12 and C13 was 149.86 and 55.78 mg/L, which correspond to 70.69- and 1.82-fold higher than for control (2.12 and 30.70 mg/L, respectively). Approximately 95.81 % of palmarumycin C12 and 87.20 % of palmarumycin C13 were distributed in resin DA-201. Conclusion: The results indicate that in situ resin adsorption is an effective strategy for enhancing the production of palmarumycins C12 and C13, and also for facilitating their recovery from the mycelial liquid culture of Berkleasmium sp.

"This study describes 32 fungal endophytes isolated from different tissues of Brugmansia aurea Lagerh. Each fungal strain was authenticated based on internal transcribed spacer rDNA sequence. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these fungi are distributed in three classes, seven orders and 12 genera. The dichloromethane extracts of endophytic strains were screened for anticancer and antimicrobial activity. Anticancer activity of extracts against human cancer cell lines revealed that 50% strains are active with IC50 <10 mu g/mL. While analysing antimicrobial potential against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, 56.25% endophytic strains displayed activity at least against one of the tested human pathogenic bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentration of 12.5-100 mu g/mL. In vitro antagonistic activity of endophytes was analysed against Sclerotinia sp., Aspergillus fumigatus, Fusarium solani, A. flavus and F. oxysporum pathogen.

"A multitude of plants from the Brazilian savanna are known for their medicinal properties. Many plants contain endophytic fungi, which lead to the production of bioactive compounds by both the fungi and their hosts. This study investigated the bioprospecting of endophytic fungi recovered from the leaves of Palicourea rigida, a native medicinal plant of the Brazilian savanna. Four fungal taxa (Colletotrichum sp. SXS649, Pestalotiopsis sp. SXS650, the order Botryosphaeriales SXS651, and Diaporthe sp. SXS652) were recovered. The phenolic, flavonoid, extracellular degrading enzymes (amylase, cellulase, protease, and tannase) and antioxidant activity of these taxa were determined. Evaluation of the antimicrobial activity showed that the Botryosphaeriales SXS651 extract displays a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 23.20 mg mL(-1) against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the Diaporthe sp. SXS652 extract exhibited an MIC of 27.00 mg mL(-1) against Escherichia coli. The Colletotrichum sp. SXS649 isolate inhibited tumors in potato discs by 69% at a concentration of 9.70 mg mL(-1). All isolates had potential bioremediation criteria against soil contaminated with soybean oil, as proved by a high percentage of germination of Lactuca sativa and a reduction in phytotoxicity. Furthermore, the taxa under investigation demonstrated antagonistic action to phytopathogenic fungi, namely, Aspergillus niger, Inonotus rickii, Pestalotiopsis mangiferae, and Coniophora puteana, with an inhibition range between 34.2% and 76.9%. The preliminary toxicity assessment showed that all isolates possessed an LC50 of less than 100 mg mL(-1) to the microcrustacean Artemia salina. These results indicate that the endophytic fungi of the Brazilian savanna are promising candidates for biotechnological and industrial applications and, in agricultural applications, for the biological control of phytopathogenic fungi.","J","dos Santos, IR; Abdel-Azeem, AM; Mohesien, MT; Piekutowska, M; Sheir, DH; da Silva, LL; Castro, CD; Carvalho, DDC; Bezerra, JDP; Saad, HA; Borges, LL; Xavier-Santos, S",NA,"","","dos Santos, Igor Romeiro; Abdel-Azeem, Ahmed M.; Mohesien, Marwa T.; Piekutowska, Magdalena; Sheir, Donia H.; da Silva, Lucas Leonardo; Castro, Camila da Silva; Costa Carvalho, Daniel Diego; Pereira Bezerra, Jadson Diogo; Saad, Hosam A.; Borges, Leonardo Luiz; Xavier-Santos, Solange",NA,NA,"Insights into the Bioprospecting of the Endophytic Fungi of the Medicinal Plant Palicourea rigida Kunth (Rubiaceae): Detailed Biological Activities","JOURNAL OF FUNGI","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Leonardo da Silva, Lucas/ABB-2674-2021; Saad, Hosam A./HGT-8795-2022; Silva, Lucas Gomes da/IUM-2802-2023; Bezerra, Jadson DP/A-5846-2019; Xavier-Santos, solange/D-2610-2013; Abdel-Azeem, Ahmed Mohamed Ahmed/I-3637-2015; Piekutowska, Magdalena/AAR-9116-2020; Coasta Carvalho, Daniel Diego/G-1035-2012","Saad, Hosam A./0000-0002-5600-7477; Bezerra, Jadson DP/0000-0002-7782-8602; Xavier-Santos, solange/0000-0002-3397-0885; Abdel-Azeem, Ahmed Mohamed Ahmed/0000-0003-2897-3966; Piekutowska, Magdalena/0000-0002-5301-4719; Coasta Carvalho, Daniel Diego/0000-0003-0564-4051; Romeiro dos Santos, Igor/0000-0002-4249-7639; T.

"Salinization of soil with sodium chloride ions inhibits plant functions, causing reduction of yield of crops. Salt tolerant microorganisms have been studied to enhance crop growth under salinity. This review describes the performance of endophytic fungi applied to crops as a supplement to plant genetics or soil management to alleviate salt stress in crops. This is achieved via inducing systemic resistance, increasing the levels of beneficial metabolites, activating antioxidant systems to scavenge ROS, and modulating plant growth phytohormones. Colonization by endophytic fungi improves nutrient uptake and maintains ionic homeostasis by modulating ion accumulation, thereby restricting the transport of Na(+)to leaves and ensuring a low cytosolic Na+:K(+)ratio in plants. Participating endophytic fungi enhance transcripts of genes encoding the high Affinity Potassium Transporter 1 (HKT1) and the inward-rectifying K(+)channels KAT1 and KAT2, which play key roles in regulating Na(+)and K(+)homeostasis. Endophytic-induced interplay of strigolactones play regulatory roles in salt tolerance by interacting with phytohormones. Future research requires further attention on the biochemical, molecular and genetic mechanisms crucial for salt stress resistance requires further attention for future research. Furthermore, to design strategies for sustained plant health with endophytic fungi, a new wave of exploration of plant-endophyte responses to combinations of stresses is mandatory.","J","Gupta, S; Schillaci, M; Walker, R; Smith, PMC; Watt, M; Roessner, U",NA,"","","Gupta, Sneha; Schillaci, Martino; Walker, Robert; Smith, Penelope M.

"BackgroundAcanthus ilicifolius var. xiamenensis (Acanthaceae) is an old world mangrove species and has long been used as a folk remedy for treating various ailments in traditional medicine. The nature source of A. ilicifolius var. xiamenensis is now in short supply because of the urban development and habitat destruction. To better utilize this resource, biodiversity and bioactivity of endophytic fungi isolated from A. ilicifolius var. xiamenensis were investigated.ResultsA total of 168 fungal isolates were cultured from leaves and stems of the mangrove plant collected in January (winter) and July (summer) 2014 at Kinmen County, Taiwan. Spent culture extract of 28 isolates were found to have bioactivities against one of the following pathogenic microorganisms: the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) and Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) and the fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. These positive extracts were mostly active against the Gram-positive bacteria and C. albicans. Corynespora cassiicola NTOU4889 and Xylaria sp. NTOU4900 inhibited growth of all 3 test bacteria whereas Phellinus noxius NTOU4917 inhibited both test fungi. A further anti-inflammatory study of culture extracts of these 28 isolates revealed that extracts with a high iNOS inhibition caused a low viability of cells, and those with a low iNOS inhibition had a high cell viability. Three extracts showed low cytotoxicity (i.e.>100% cell viability) and high iNOS inhibition (<15% of NO production) of cells and they were Phoma sp. 2 NTOU4338, Nodulisporium sp.

"Recent investigations carried out all over the world have disclosed the capacity of a multitude of endophytic fungal species/strains to produce bioactive compounds which are the same or structurally related to those synthesized by their host plants. This intriguing phenomenon has implemented huge research activity aimed at ascertaining the nature of the biological processes underlying this convergence, as well as to characterize the genetic bases of the biosynthetic schemes. Insights on these basic issues may support the biotechnological exploitation of wild strains, and their eventual improvement through genome editing. Aspects concerning the use of next generation sequencing technologies for the comparative elucidation of the biosynthetic pathways operating in endophytic fungi and their host plants are reviewed in this paper in view of applicative perspectives. Our literature search yielded 21 references dealing with at least 26 strains which have been the subject of experimental activities involving massively parallel genome and transcriptome sequencing methods in the last eight years.","J","Bielecka, M; Pencakowski, B; Nicoletti, R",NA,"","","Bielecka, Monika; Pencakowski, Bartosz; Nicoletti, Rosario",NA,NA,"Using Next-Generation Sequencing Technology to Explore Genetic Pathways in Endophytic Fungi in the Syntheses of Plant Bioactive Metabolites","AGRICULTURE-BASEL","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bielecka, Monika/ABC-2507-2021; Nicoletti, Rosario/H-6500-2019","Bielecka, Monika/0000-0002-0067-6073; Nicoletti, Rosario/0000-0002-3049-4641; Pencakowski, Bartosz/0000-0002-6166-0454",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2077-0472","",NA,NA,"FEB",2022,12,"2",NA,"","",NA,"","","187","10.3390/agriculture12020187","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture12020187","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000763376400001","View Full Record in Web of Science",437,"Review"
"Nitric oxide (NO) is a signal molecule that plays crucial roles in plant secondary metabolism. In order to explore the signaling mechanism of endophytic fungal elicitors (Penicillium commune 2J1 and Neurospora crassa 3J1) for promoting essential oil accumulation in Cinnamomum longepaniculatum, changes in the contents of NO and essential oil were investigated after the addition of elicitors to the C. longepaniculatum cultures. The essential oil contents in C. longepaniculatum cells were increased upon addition of the NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) into the culture. The release of NO was suppressed and the essential oil contents decreased after the NO-specific scavenger 2-4-calboxypheny1-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimiclazol ine-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO) was added into the cell cultures. cPTIO did not completely inhibit essential oil accumulation in C. longepaniculatum cells induced by endophytic fungal elicitors. Based on these experimental results, adding elicitors were found to significantly stimulate NO release and essential oil synthesis in C. longepaniculatum cells. Reliable evidence that NO can effectively mediate endophytic fungal elicitors to promote essential oil synthesis in C. longepaniculatum cells is presented in this study. It is further demonstrated that endophytic fungal elicitors may facilitate essential oil synthesis in C. longepaniculatum suspension cells through other signal transduction pathways.

"Objective: The aim of the present study was to test the antioxidant and cytotoxic and DNA protection activities of ethyl acetate extracts of endophytic fungi isolated from Tragia involucrata Linn. (Euphorbiaceae). Materials and Methods: The 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl scavenging, reducing power, and total antioxidant assay were used to evaluate the antioxidant activity. Cytotoxic activity of endophytic fungal extracts against MCF-7 and MOLT-4 cell lines was carried out using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide method. Results: We have successfully isolated four endophytic fungi from 7 involucrata, namely Penicillium citrinum CGJ-C1 (GenBank accession No. KT780618), P citrinum CGJ-C2 (GenBank accession No. KP739821), Cladosporium sp. CGJ-D1 (GenBank accession No. KP739822), and Cryptendoxyla hypophia CGJ-D2 (GenBank accession No. KT780619). The ethyl acetate extract of P citrinum CGJ-C2 showed the highest antioxidant as well as cytotoxic activity among the four fungal extracts taken for the study. All the extracts showed moderate DNA protection activity. Conclusions: Further studies on the isolation and purification of the lead molecule will help in designing the novel therapy for different ailments associated with free radical generation.","J","Danagoudar, A; Joshi, CG; Ravi, SK; Kumar, HGR; Ramesh, BN",NA,"","","Danagoudar, Ananda; Joshi, Chandrashekhar G.; Ravi, Sunil Kumar; Kumar, Heggodu G.

"The endophytic fungi live inside plant tissues and do not develop any disease to their hosts. These microorganisms can produce bioactive compounds. In this work, we aimed to evaluate the leaf endophytic fungi microbiota from J. brandegeana using the culture-dependent method and multilocus sequence analysis. The endophyte's isolation was performed by the fragmentation method and the MLSA phylogeny was made using ITS, elongation factor 1-alpha, beta-tubulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and, actin genes. For the screening selection, agar piece test was performed and, amongst the strains, JB06 isolate was chosen for metabolic extraction from the fermented culture and the evaluation of the antibacterial, antioxidant, antiproliferative activities and, phenolic compounds assay. Through the MLSA analysis, there were five genera of fungi identified, with Colletotrichum the higher isolated. For the antioxidant assay using the fungal extract obtained from Mycoleptodiscus indicus (JB06), the best results were obtained with the ABTS method. Antiproliferative effects by the crude extract of the endophyte against the tumor hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2/C3A) were found. In summary, our findings revealed highly diverse endophytic fungi associated with J. brandegeana, with the bioprospection of the endophyte M. indicus with biotechnological potential for the health field.

"This study aimed to increase the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants through inoculation with endophytic fungi. As endophytes influence medicinal plants' biological properties, twenty fungal strains were isolated from the medicinal plant Ocimum tenuiflorum. Among all fungal isolates, the R2 strain showed the highest antagonistic activity towards plant pathogenic fungi Rosellinia necatrix and Fusarium oxysporum. The partial ITS region of the R2 strain was deposited in the GenBank nucleotide sequence databases under accession number ON652311 as Fusarium fujikuroi isolate R2 OS. To ascertain the impact of an endophytic fungus on the biological functions of medicinal plants, Stevia rebaudiana seeds were inoculated with Fusarium fujikuroi (ON652311). In the DPPH assay, the IC50 value of the inoculated Stevia plant extracts (methanol, chloroform, and positive control) was 72.082 mu g/mL, 85.78 mu g/mL, and 18.86 mu g/mL, respectively. In the FRAP assay, the IC50 value of the inoculated Stevia extracts (methanol, chloroform extract, and positive control) was 97.064 mu M Fe2+ equivalents, 117.662 mu M Fe2+ equivalents, and 53.384 mu M Fe2+ equivalents, respectively. In the extracts of the plant inoculated with endophytic fungus, rutin and syringic acid (polyphenols) concentrations were 20.8793 mg/L and 5.4389 mg/L, respectively, which were higher than in the control plant extracts. This approach can be further utilized for other medicinal plants to increase their phytochemical content and hence medicinal potential in a sustainable way.","J","Devi, R; Abdulhaq, A; Verma, R; Sharma, K; Kumar, D; Kumar, A; Tapwal, A; Yadav, R; Mohan, S",NA,"","","Devi, Reema; Abdulhaq, Ahmed; Verma, Rachna; Sharma, Kiran; Kumar, Dinesh; Kumar, Ajay; Tapwal, Ashwani; Yadav, Rahul; Mohan, Syam",NA,NA,"Improvement in the Phytochemical Content and Biological Properties of Stevia rebaudiana (Bertoni) Bertoni Plant Using Endophytic Fungi Fusarium fujikuroi","PLANTS-BASEL","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kumar, Ajay/JFB-0059-2023; Kumar, Dinesh/AAA-7914-2021; Verma, Rachna/AAA-6251-2021","Kumar, Dinesh/0000-0003-3485-6408; Verma, Rachna/0000-0001-5321-9450; Tapwal, Ashwani/0000-0002-7267-0500",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2223-7747","",NA,NA,"MAR",2023,12,"5",NA,"","",NA,"","","1151","10.3390/plants12051151","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants12051151","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36904011,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000948191200001","View Full Record in Web of Science",444,"Presence"
"We investigated whether variation in foliar endophyte frequency among mountain birch trees from different maternal families was due in part to genetic differences among trees. The effect of different environmental conditions on the susceptibility of these mountain birch families to foliar endophytes was tested. The 3-year study was conducted in two tree gardens (altitudinal difference 180 m) with ten families of mountain birch. The frequency of the commonest endophytic fungus in mountain birch leaves, Fusicladium sp., was significantly affected by mountain birch family, with the ranking of families relative to Fusicladium sp. frequency being consistent from environment to environment. Variation in the frequency of Melanconium sp. was difficult to interpret because of significant family x garden x year interaction. Fusicladium sp. and Melanconium sp. endophytes were most frequent in different tree individuals, families and gardens. We conclude that mountain birch trees show heritable variation in their foliar endophyte frequency, and thus one of the conditions necessary for foliar endophytes of mountain birch trees to be able to affect the evolution of their host plant is fulfilled. However, the effect of mountain birch family on the frequency of endophytic fungi varies depending on the endophytic genera in question and partially also on environmental conditions.","J","Elamo, P; Helander, ML; Saloniemi, I; Neuvonen, S",NA,"","","Elamo, P; Helander, ML; Saloniemi, I; Neuvonen, S",NA,NA,"Birch family and environmental conditions affect endophytic fungi in leaves","OECOLOGIA","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Saloniemi, Irma/C-8893-2011","Helander, Marjo/0000-0002-9759-4321",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0029-8549","","",NA,NA,"FEB",1999,118,"2",NA,"","",NA,"151","156","","10.1007/s004420050713","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s004420050713","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28307689,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000078978400005","View Full Record in Web of Science",445,"Presence"
"Taxillus chinensis (DC.) Danser is an extensively used medicinal shrub in the traditional as well as modern systems of medicines. It is a perennial hemiparasitic plant, which is difficult to propagate artificially because of its low parasitic rate. Successful parasitism of parasitic plants is to fuse their tissues and connect their vasculature to the host vasculature building a physiological bridge, which can efficiently withdraw water, sugars and nutrients from their host plants. It is reported that endophytic fungi play an important role in cell wall degradation and fusion, which is the key forming process of the physiological bridge. Therefore, in this study, the endophytic fungi from T. chinensis of different hosts were isolated, and then the organisms that could degrade the main components of the cell walls were screened out using a medium consisting of guaihuol and cellulose degradation capacity. The results showed that five strains were screened out from 72 endophytic fungi of T. chinensis which with high enzyme activities for lignocellulosic degradation. The laccase and cellulase activities of five strains reached their peaks at day 7, and the highest enzyme activities of these two enzymes were found in strain P6, which was 117.66 and 1.66 U/mL, respectively. Manganese peroxidase of strain 4 and lignin peroxidase of strain N6 also reached their peaks at day 7 and were the highest among the 5 strains, with enzyme activities of 11.61 and 6.64 U/mL, respectively. Strains 4, 15, 31, N6 and P6 were identified as Colletotrichum sp., Nigerrospora sphaerica, Exserohilum sp., Diaporthe phaseolorum and Pestalotiopsis sp., respectively, according to their morphological and molecular biology properties. The endophytic fungi may secrete efficient cell wall degradation enzymes, which promote the dissolution and relaxation of the cell wall between T. chinensis and host, thus contributing to the parasitism of T. chinensis.","J","Song, LS; Pan, LM; Jiang, N; Fu, JN; Wan, LY; Wei, SG",NA,"","","Song, Lisha; Pan, Limei; Jiang, Ni; Fu, Jine; Wan, Lingyun; Wei, Shugen",NA,NA,"Effects of endophytic fungi on parasitic process of Taxillus chinensis","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Wei, Shugen/0000-0003-3233-8017",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2045-2322","","",NA,NA,"MAY 11",2022,12,"1",NA,"","",NA,"","","7744","10.1038/s41598-022-11940-z","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-11940-z","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35546173,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000794011500091","View Full Record in Web of Science",446,"Presence"
"A Cinnamomum longepaniculatum (Gamble) N. Chao cell suspension culture system was established using four endophytic fungal elicitor strains, Penicillium commune (2J1), Neurospora crassa (3J1), Aspergillus fumigatus (5J2) and Penicillium paneum (YB) to explore the mechanisms underlying the effects of endophytic fungal elicitors on essential oil (1,8-cineole and alpha-terpineol) accumulation in suspension cells. Essential oil content reached a peak at 21d after treating cells with 40 mg/L 2J1 and 3J1. The contents of 1,8-cineole increased by 68.21 and 54.96% and those of a-terpineol increased by 218.51 and 207.65%, respectively. Synthesis of the essential oil of C. longepaniculatum was significantly enhanced within the elicitor concentration range of 20-60 mg/L and reached a maximum at 40 mg/L. Furthermore, the peroxidase (POD) content, catalase (CAT) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content of suspension cells increased significantly, and these increases were to an extent positively correlated with essential oil accumulation. No significant differences were detected between C. longepaniculatum cells treated with 5J2 and YB elicitors and the control group in terms of essential oil accumulation, CAT activity, and POD and MDA contents. The results showed that treatment with 2J1 and 3J1 elicitors could significantly increase the accumulation of essential oil in C. longepaniculatum cells.

"In a natural ecosystem, endophytic fungi in the internal tissues of plants help to improve the growth of the host plants and to decrease the negative effects of biotic and abiotic stresses without having adverse effects. In Japan, Vicia villosa (hairy vetch), a legume plant with a high capacity to fix nitrogen, is usually used as a cover crop before soybeans to enhance the fertility and structure of the soil. This study aimed to isolate endophytic fungi associated with different tissues of hairy vetch and to evaluate their potential for growth-promoting and biocontrol effects in plants. Thirty-three fungal endophytes belonging to Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were isolated from the leaf, stem, and root tissues of hairy vetch grown under both greenhouse and field conditions. The highest colonization frequency in both the greenhouse and field-grown hairy vetch plants was obtained from the root tissues. All isolates were checked for indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and siderophore production. The maximum IAA content in the culture filtrate (4.21 mu g mL(-1)) was produced by the isolate hvef7 (Cladosporium cladosporioides), followed by hvef18 (Penicillium simplicissimum) (3.02 mu g mL(-1)) and hvef1 (Cladosporium pseudocladosporioides) (2.32 mu g mL(-1)). Nineteen isolates among a total of thirty-three isolates produced siderophores. Moreover, some of the isolated strains could solubilize phosphate and potassium. Most of the isolates showed antagonistic potential against Calonectria ilicicola. The results of this study show that endophytic fungi isolated from hairy vetch have the potential for application as plant growth promotion fungi (PGPF) to promote plant growth and control disease in sustainable agriculture.","J","Taheri, P; Kaida, R; Dastogeer, KMG; Appiah, KS; Yasuda, M; Tanaka, K; Korrani, HM; Azizi, M; Okazaki, S; Fujii, Y",NA,"","","Taheri, Parisa; Kaida, Rumi; Dastogeer, Khondoker M.

"Orchidaceous plants have symbiotic relationships with endophytic fungi, including mycorrhizal fungi, which play important roles in the seed germination and growth of the host plants. In this study, endophytic fungal communities isolated from the roots of Cephalanthera longibracteata collected from three different sites in Korea were analyzed, and it was determined whether fungal communities were preferentially correlated with the sites. The fungal isolates were identified by sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer regions of rDNA. In total, 30 species of endophytic fungi, including two species of mycorrhizal fungi belonging to the genus Tulasnella, were identified. Leptodontidium orchidicola showed the highest frequency and was isolated from all root samples. Species diversity and richness were not significantly different among sites. However, the community structure of the endophytic fungi significantly differed among sites, suggesting that the site characteristics affected the community composition of the endophytic fungi colonizing the roots of C. longibracteata. Our findings will aid in developing methods involving the use of symbiotic fungi for orchid conservation and restoration in native habitats.","J","Lee, BH; Kwon, WJ; Kim, JY; Park, JS; Eom, AH",NA,"","","Lee, Bong-Hyung; Kwon, Woo-Jin; Kim, Jin-Young; Park, Jin-Seo; Eom, Ahn-Heum",NA,NA,"Differences among Endophytic Fungal Communities Isolated from the Roots of Cephalanthera longibracteata Collected from Different Sites in Korea","MYCOBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Eom, Ahn-Heum/0000-0002-6821-1088",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1229-8093","2092-9323","",NA,NA,"DEC",2017,45,"4",NA,"","",NA,"312","317","","10.5941/MYCO.2017.45.4.312","http://dx.doi.org/10.5941/MYCO.2017.45.4.312","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29371798,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000423322400008","View Full Record in Web of Science",449,"Presence"

LG41, harbored in the roots of the Chinese medicinal plant Xanthium sibiricum. Their structures were confirmed through combined spectroscopic analysis (NMR and HRMS(n)), and their absolute configurations were deduced by ECD calculations or optical rotation data.

"The genus Artemisia, a collection of similar to 400 hardy herbaceous plant and shrub species, is an important resource contributing to chemistry, medicine, agriculture, industry, and ecology. Its communities of endophytic fungi have only recently begun to be explored. Summarized from studies conducted on the fungal endophytes in Artemisia species, both fungal phylogenetic diversity and the associated bioactivity was examined. Isolations from 14 species of Artemisia have led to 51 genera of fungal endophytes, 28 families, and 18 orders. Endophytes belonged mainly to Ascomycota, except for two taxa of Cantharellales and Sporidiobolales, one taxon of Mucoromycota, and one species of Oomycota. The mostly common families were Pleosporaceae, Trichocomaceae, Leptosphaeriaceae, and Botryosphaeriaceae (relative abundance = 14.89, 8.51, 7.14 and 6.38, respectively). In the search for bioactive metabolites, 27 novel compounds were characterized and 22 metabolites were isolated between 2006 and 2017.

"Purple blotch disease caused by Alternaria porri is the main destructive foliar disease of genus Allium, causing significant losses in yield of the crops. Recently, purple blotch disease is controlled by synthetic fungicides. However, fungicides have negative effects on the environment. Endophytic fungi can be used as an alternative control because a close symbiosis with the internal tissue of the host can minimize competition in new and complex ecosystems. This study aimed to explore and identify endophytic fungi that have the highest inhibition ability against A. porri and investigate the antagonistic mechanism. The method used in this study is an exploration of endophytic fungi, isolation of A. porri, in vitro antagonism tests, observation of the antagonistic mechanism, extraction of crude protein, SDS-PAGE, and identification. The antagonistic fungi that had the highest inhibition ability were identified as Peniciffium citrinum with an inhibitory of 60.04%. Crude protein extracted from P. citrinum which showed inhibitory activity against A. porri is saturation level of ammonium sulfate 80% with a molecular weight of 40 kDa.

"Aims: Isolation, identification and characterization of an endophytic fungus from Juniperus communis L. Horstmann, as a novel producer of deoxypodophyllotoxin and its in vitro antimicrobial assay. Methods and Results: The methodology for the isolation, identification and characterization of a novel endophytic fungus from the twigs of the J. communis L. Horstmann plant, which specifically and consistently produces deoxypodophyllotoxin, was unequivocally established. The fungus was identified as Aspergillus fumigatus Fresenius by molecular, morphological and physiological methods. Deoxypodophyllotoxin was identified and quantified by high-resolution LC-MS, LC-MS2 and LC-MS3. The antimicrobial efficacy of the fungal deoxypodophyllotoxin against a panel of pathogenic bacteria was established. Conclusions: The production of deoxypodophyllotoxin (found in the host) by the cultured endophyte is an enigmatic observation. It demonstrates the transfer of gene(s) for such accumulation by horizontal means from the host plant to its endophytic counterpart. It would be interesting to further study the deoxypodophyllotoxin production and regulation by the cultured endophyte in J. communis and in axenic cultures. Significance and Impact of the Study: This endophyte is a potential handle for scientific and commercial exploitation.

"The purpose of this study was to isolate and characterize endophytic fungi from the stem tissue which can produce fragrant ingredients in Aquilaria sinensis (also called agarwood) to determine their antitumor and antimicrobial activities. Twenty-eight fungal endophytes were isolated from agarwood by strict sterile sample preparation and were classified into 14 genera and 4 taxonomic classes (Sordariomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Saccharomycetes, and Zygomycetes) based on molecular identification. Of the 28 isolates, 13 (46.4%) showed antimicrobial activity against at least one of the test strains by the agar well diffusion method, and 23 isolates (82.1%) displayed antitumor activity against at least one of five cancer cell lines by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The diameters of inhibition zones of YNAS07, YNAS14, HNAS04, HNAS05, HNAS08, and HNAS11 were equal to or higher than 14.0 mm against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, B. subtilis, Aspergillus fumigatus, and B. subtilis, respectively. The inhibition rates of YNAS06, YNAS08, and HNAS06 were not less than 60% to 293-T, 293-T, and SKVO3 cells, respectively. These results suggest that the endophytic fungi associated with agarwood will provide us with not only useful micro-ecological information, but also potential antimicrobial and antitumor agents.","J","Cui, JL; Guo, SX; Xiao, PG",NA,"","","Cui, Jin-long; Guo, Shun-xing; Xiao, Pei-gen",NA,NA,"Antitumor and antimicrobial activities of endophytic fungi from medicinal parts of Aquilaria sinensis","JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE B","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1673-1581","","",NA,NA,"MAY",2011,12,"5",NA,"","",NA,"385","392","","10.1631/jzus.B1000330","http://dx.doi.org/10.1631/jzus.B1000330","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,21528493,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000290277400007","View Full Record in Web of Science",458,"Presence"

"Ectomycorrhizal and endophytic fungi of Betula platyphylla Sukatchev var. japonica Hara seedlings were investigated by bioassay using soils from sites where the surface layer had been removed by destructive disturbances. Soil samples were taken from sites A, B, C and D, where 1, 2-3, 4-5, and 7-8 years, respectively had passed since disturbance. Naturally regenerated B. platyphylla var. japonica seedlings grew at sites C and D, but not at sites A or B. The percentages of ectomycorrhizal formation in seedlings were significantly lower in the soils from site A (4%) and site B (13%), compared to those in the soils from site C (53%) and site D (37%). The numbers of ectomycorrhizal morphologic types in sites A, B, C, and D were eight, five, one, and seven, respectively. The same dominant type of ectomycorrhiza was found in sites C and D, and this type was different from those in sites A and B. The frequencies of colonization of seedling roots by endophytic fungi, especially Mycelium radicis atrovirens Melin (MRA) in soils from sites A and B were 31 and 33%, respectively; these frequencies were significantly higher than those for site C (0%) and site D (2%). During the initial stage of establishment of vegetation following disturbance, the quantities and types of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the field that have the potential to associate with B. platyphylla var. japonica might rapidly change after invasion of the host plant.

"Fast-growing populations of phytophagous insects can be limited by the presence of natural enemies and by alkaloids that are produced by symbiotic associations of many temperate grass species with endophytic fungi. It is unclear if and how acquired plant defences derived from endophytic fungi interact with natural enemies to affect phytophagous insect populations. To assess the relative importance of endophytic fungi compared to that of natural enemies on the population dynamics of phytophagous insects, we carried out a fully factorial field experiment, in which the presence of natural enemies and the presence of endophytic fungi were manipulated simultaneously. Target colonies of aphids were monitored for 8 weeks starting from their natural appearance in the field to the end of the aphid season. We show that on Lolium perenne increased natural enemy densities reduced the individual numbers of two common cereal aphids, Rhopalosiphum padi and Metopolophium festucae. The presence of the endophytic fungi Neotyphodium lolii reduced the number of M. festucae but did not affect the number of R. padi. The reduction in R. padi numbers by predators and parasitoids was not influenced by the presence of endophytes. For adult M. festucae, however, the negative effects of natural enemies were significant only in the absence of endophytes. Over the duration of the experiment, the effect of natural enemies on aphid colony growth was much stronger than the effect of the endophytic fungi N. lolii, presumably because predator and parasitoid action on aphid colonies is much faster than any effects of endophytes. Our results demonstrate that with simultaneous action of acquired endosymbionts and natural enemies, both factors can control aphid colony growth but they generally act independently of each other.","J","Härri, SA; Krauss, J; Müller, CB",NA,"","","Haerri, Simone A.; Krauss, Jochen; Mueller, Christine B.",NA,NA,"Natural enemies act faster than endophytic fungi in population control of cereal aphids","JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Krauss, Jochen/C-6216-2014; Harri, Simone/A-6960-2010","Krauss, Jochen/0000-0003-2304-9117;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0021-8790","1365-2656","",NA,NA,"MAY",2008,77,"3",NA,"","",NA,"605","611","","10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01373.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01373.x","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18312338,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000254990300021","View Full Record in Web of Science",461,"Presence"

"Calotropis procera has many important medicinal properties with proven pharmacological potential. Some of these properties may be mediated by its fungal endophytes. This study analyzed, for the first time, the community of endophytic fungi of C. procera outside its region of origin. A total of 156 fungal isolates distributed across 19 taxa were obtained from 468 fragments of C. procera leaves at different stages of maturation. The rate of endophyte colonization increased with the leaf age/development. The dominant species of endophytic fungi of C. procera introduced in Northeast Brazil were different from those found in studies on the same species and other species of the same genus in native regions. The dominant endophyte was Phaeoramularia calotropidis (63.5 %), followed by Guignardia bidwellii (21.1 %). Six isolates of endophytic fungi showed antimicrobial activity against human pathogenic micro-organisms and one plant pathogenic fungus. The antibacterial activity was more intense than the antifungal activity. The endophytic Curuularia pallescens (URM 6048) stood out inhibited Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyo genes, the plant pathogenic fungus Colletotrichum dematium.

"Context: Plants harbor endophytes with potential bioactivity. Markhamia tomentosa (Benth) K. Schum ex. Engl. (Bignoniaceae) is reported to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticancer activities. Objective: The antifungal and antiproliferative properties of endophytic fungi extracts and fractions from M. tomentosa were evaluated. Material and methods: Endophytic fungi were isolated from the leaves of M. tomentosa and identified by ITS-rDNA sequence analysis. The antagonistic effect of the fungal strains was investigated against pathogenic fungi viz, Fusarium oxysporum, Sclerotinia sclerotiorium, Rhizoctonia solani, and Botrytis cinerea using the dual culture assay for 5-7 days. Antiproliferative effect of the fungal extracts and fractions (3.91-250 mu g/mL) on HeLa cancer cell line was tested and IC50 was calculated. Poisoning food assay and antifeedant activity against the pathogenic fungi and Spodoptera litura larvae, for 7 days and 2 h, respectively, was also tested at concentrations of 250, 500 and 1000 mu g/mL. Results: Fungal endophytes Trichoderma longibrachiatum and Syncephalastrum racemosum were isolated from the leaves of M. tomentosa. Isolated endophytic fungal strains and solvent extracts showed MIC value of 1000 mu g/mL against tested pathogenic fungi in the dual culture and poisoning food assays. Methanol fraction of S. racemosum isolate showed the most effective antiproliferative activity with IC50 of 43.56 mu g/mL. Minimal feeding deterrent activity against S. litura larvae was also observed. Discussion and conclusion: These findings showed that the leaves of Markhamia tomentosa harbor strains of endophytic fungi with promising health benefits, and suggest their antifungal and antiproliferative effects against pathogenic fungi and HeLa cancer cell line.","J","Ibrahim, M; Kaushik, N; Sowemimo, A; Chhipa, H; Koekemoer, T; van de Venter, M; Odukoya, OA",NA,"","","Ibrahim, Mutiat; Kaushik, Nutan; Sowemimo, Abimbola; Chhipa, Hemraj; Koekemoer, Trevor; van de Venter, Maryna; Odukoya, Olukemi A.",NA,NA,"Antifungal and antiproliferative activities of endophytic fungi isolated from the leaves of Markhamia tomentosa","PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kaushik, Nutan/H-7271-2012; Chhipa, Hemraj/U-5364-2019","Chhipa, Hemraj/0000-0001-7591-848X; van de Venter, Maryna/0000-0003-3816-1419; Kaushik, Nutan/0000-0002-3870-8093; Koekemoer, Trevor/0000-0002-8540-3276; Ibrahim, Mutiat/0000-0001-5900-7950",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1388-0209","1744-5116","",NA,NA,"",2017,55,"1",NA,"","",NA,"590","595","","10.1080/13880209.2016.1263671","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2016.1263671","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27937112,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000390846600071","View Full Record in Web of Science",467,"Presence"
"Over the last decades, endophytic fungi represent a new source of pharmacologically active secondary metabolites based on the underlying assumption that they live symbiotically within their plant host. In the present study, a new endophytic fungus was isolated from Rauwolfia macrophylla, a medicinal plant from Cameroon. The fungus showed a highest homology to Curvularia sp. based on complete nucleotide sequence data generated from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of ribosomal DNA region. Large scale fermentation, working-up and separation of the strain extract using different chromatographic techniques afforded three bioactive compounds: 2'-deoxyribolactone (1), hexylitaconic acid (2) and ergosterol (3). The chemical structures of compounds 1-3 were confirmed by 1 and 2D NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, and comparison with corresponding literature data.

"Endophytic fungi live inside plant tissues but do not cause any disease. Several reports have now revealed that they have great influence on host. In this study, the beneficial role of endophytic fungi is highlighted and explored. Endophytic fungi isolated from healthy plants were identified as Aspergillus terreus, Curvularia lunata, C. hawaiiensis, Macrophomina phaseolina, Fusarium solani, Talaromyces assiutensis, and T. trachyspermus using 18S rRNA gene sequencing. In vitro, fungi evaluated for antimicrobial activity, showed significant activity. These fungi were tested in field application by exploring their broad spectrum. Talaromyces assiutensis and T. trachyspermus were applied in pots and field plot experiments using sunflower as test plants, along with endophytic Cephalosporium sp., and Chaetomium sp. Endophytic fungi showed significant activity against root rot pathogens affecting sunflower and improved plant biomass. They also improved production of plant defense biochemical markers (polyphenolic content and salicylic acid) with improvement in antioxidant potential. These fungi are used as biological control agents, so their culture filtrates are used to check the presence of metabolites by GC-MS. Several new compounds were isolated from T. assiutensis. The major bioactive compounds are Coumarin, 3,4-dihydro-6-methoxy-4,4-dimethyl, 1-Monolinoleoylglycerol trimethylsilyl ether, 1,2-Propanediol, 3-(octadecyloxy), Ethyl iso-allocholate, and 1H-Pyrazole, which possess antioxidant, antitumor, antibacterial, anticancer, and antimicrobial properties.

"Most plants in nature establish symbiotic associations with endophytic fungi in soil. Beneficial endophytic fungi induce a systemic response in the aboveground parts of the host plant, thus promoting the growth and fitness of host plants. Meanwhile, temperature elevation from climate change widely affects global plant biodiversity as well as crop quality and yield. Over the past decades, great progresses have been made in the response of plants to high ambient temperature and to symbiosis with endophytic fungi. However, little is known about their synergistic effect on host plants. The endophytic fungus Serendipita indica colonizes the roots of a wide range of plants, including Arabidopsis. Based on the Arabidopsis-S. indica symbiosis experimental system, we analyzed the synergistic effect of high ambient temperature and endophytic fungal symbiosis on host plants. By transcriptome analysis, we found that DNA replication-related genes were significantly upregulated during the systemic response of Arabidopsis aboveground parts to S. indica colonization. Plant hormones, such as jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET), play important roles in plant growth and systemic responses. We found that high ambient temperature repressed the JA and ET signaling pathways of Arabidopsis aboveground parts during the systemic response to S. indica colonization in roots. Meanwhile, PIF4 is the central hub transcription factor controlling plant thermosensory growth under high ambient temperature in Arabidopsis. PIF4 is also involving JA and/or ET signaling pathway. We found that PIF4 target genes overlapped with many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during the systemic response, and further showed that the growth promotion efficiency of S. indica on the pif4 mutant was higher than that on the wild-type plants. In short, our data showed that high ambient temperature strengthened the growth promotion effect of S. indica fungi on the aboveground parts of the host plant Arabidopsis, and the growth promotion effect of the systemic response under high ambient temperature was regulated by PIF4.","J","Chen, XJ; Yin, YQ; Zhu, XM; Xia, X; Han, JJ",NA,"","","Chen, Xiao-Jie; Yin, Yue-Qing; Zhu, Xin-Meng; Xia, Xue; Han, Jia-Jia",NA,NA,"High Ambient Temperature Regulated the Plant Systemic Response to the Beneficial Endophytic Fungus Serendipita indica","FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"xia, xue/HNR-4662-2023","Han, Jia Jia/0000-0002-3904-6642",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-462X","","",NA,NA,"MAR 16",2022,13,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","844572","10.3389/fpls.2022.844572","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.844572","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35371134,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000777688600001","View Full Record in Web of Science",474,"Presence"

"Background Endophytic fungi are excellent sources of new natural bioactive products with potential for exploitation in medical, agricultural, and industrial fields. Beneficial effects of endophytes are not only limited to promoting plant growth, but also to react as plant protection agents against phytopathogenic microorganisms and plant pests. The tomato leaf miner, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is one of the main tomato pests in South America and in the Mediterranean basin. Results In the present work, the effectiveness of two endophytic fungi Clonostachys spp. and Beauveria bassiana were tested against T. absoluta larvae. Evaluation of the larvicidal effect in the laboratory by spraying 3 concentrations (D-1 = 4 x 10(7) spores/ml, D-2 = 4 x 10(6) spores/ml and D-3 = 4 x 10(5) spores/ml) of fungal suspensions showed remarkable efficacy, which varied depending on the tested strain, concentration of application and time of exposure. Statistical analysis showed highly significant results on larval mortality rates for both endophytic than the control. After 15 days, dead larvae were mummified. Applications of tested isolates in greenhouse experiments confirmed their marked biological control efficacy than the synthetic insecticide (Emamectin benzoat). Number of mined leaves decreased depending on the contact time of the larvae with the fungal spores. Conclusion Results suggest that the two endophytic fungi B. bassiana and Clonostachys spp. were very effective entomopathogenic fungi against T. absoluta. Indeed, the present study revealed the pathogenicity of Clonostachys spp. against T. absoluta larvae for the first time.","J","Mahmoud, FM; Bendebbah, R; Benssaci, B; Toudji, F; Tafifet, L; Krimi, Z",NA,"","","Mohamed Mahmoud, Fadhela; Bendebbah, Rachida; Benssaci, Bouchra; Toudji, Fethia; Tafifet, Lamia; Krimi, Zoulikha",NA,NA,"Entomopathogenic efficacy of the endophytic fungi: Clonostachys sp. and Beauveria bassiana on Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) larvae under laboratory and greenhouse conditions","EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Mohamed Mahmoud, Fadila/0000-0001-5086-5596",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1110-1768","2536-9342","",NA,NA,"FEB 25",2021,31,"1",NA,"","",NA,"","","43","10.1186/s41938-021-00392-8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41938-021-00392-8","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000621815200001","View Full Record in Web of Science",479,"Presence"

"Endophytic fungi have been perceived as a potential source of bioactive secondary metabolites. Whereas Rhizopus as the endophytic fungi were isolated from the medicinal plant Abutilon indicum (L.) Sweet. under the family Malvaceae found in tropical areas. This work aims to isolate and identify the fungal endophyte Rhizopus sp. from the medicinal plant Abutilon indicum at the molecular level, and the second objective is to test the Plant Growth Promoting activity like Indole Acidic Acid A, Hydrogen cyanide, Phosphate solubility (PO4), Catalase test, and it is the proof for plant endophyte association, lastly to analyse the extract of Rhizopus in phytochemical and pharmacology activity using Gas chromatography and Mass spectrometry study. The isolated fungal plant growth-promoting activity like Indole acetic acid production, Phosphate solubility assay, HCN production and Catalase enzyme synthesis was tested. As compared to IAA, PO4 solubility assay, HCN and Catalase synthesis test culture gave positive results. It described endophytic fungal within-hosts that are actively responsible against pathogens and stress tolerance conditions. Isolated fungal culture was able to synthesize catalase enzymes and HCN compounds. Rhizopus can act as a Phyto stimulator, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, increased stress tolerance capacity and also can increase the water availability in the nutrition supply to the host plant. In the qualitative screening test, there are about 12 phytochemicals that showed positive results. It gives the effort of the plant to act as a defensive mechanism against pathogens. Based on morphological and phylogenetic analyses, fungal species were identified: as Rhizopus delemer UICC 26. Accession no: LC514308. It is an unfamiliar mutant strain. Further GC-MS analysis revealed that the Identification of 20 bioactive compounds in the ethanolic extract of fungus Rhizopus delemer was Butane, 1,1-diethoxy-2-methyl-. 3,3-diethoxy-2-butanone. identified.

"BackgroundIpomoea pes-caprae is a plant of sand coasts and it can tolerate stresses, such as high salinity, strong wind and sand movements and lack of nutrients. It plays an important role in coast protection and preventing erosion. Fungal endophytes show high biodiversity and have a strong influence on the survival of plants under different stress factors. Although this plant is important for sand coast ecosystems, little is known about the associated fungi. In this study, we isolated and identified endophytic fungi of Ipomoea pes-caprae, a dominant plant along the shore of Taiwan. The dataset contains 896 records, which correspond to 177 species. The geographical scope of the dataset covers the northern subtropical area of the main island of Taiwan, with its sand coasts in New Taipei, Taoyuan, Hsinchu and Taichung and two botanical gardens in Taipei and Taichung. The detailed original data of fungal diversity are rarely publicly shared under strictly formalised and, thus, reusable standards. As an example for such an approach, the complete occurrence dataset was made available in the Darwin Core Archive format via the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) under Version 1.13, Taiwan Biodiversity Information Facility (TaiBIF) https://doi.org/10.15468/9h9rcg. In this first data paper on endophytic fungi, the scientific name and associated DNA sequence in the dataset were directly linked to other free online resource (Index Fungorum, GenBank), which shows the potential of GBIF for linking together different online data repositories.","J","Yeh, YH; Kirschner, R",NA,"","","Yeh, Yu -Hung; Kirschner, Roland",NA,NA,"The diversity of cultivable endophytic fungi of the sand coast plant Ipomoea pes-caprae in Taiwan","BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1314-2836","1314-2828","",NA,NA,"FEB 17",2023,11,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","e98878","10.3897/BDJ.11.e98878","http://dx.doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.11.e98878","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000946313400001","View Full Record in Web of Science",482,"Presence"

"Endophytic fungi represent a diverse group of Fungi belonging primarily to the Phylum Ascomycota, and exist asymptomatically within tissues of plants. Clavicipitaceous fungal endophytes can promote plant productivity in grasses. Less is known about non-clavicipitaceous endophytes, which are the dominant fungal endophytes in many plants. Panicum uirgatum (switchgrass), a prairie grass native to North America, is a potential candidate as a biofuel crop. Our knowledge of the endophytic fungi of switchgrass and their potential effects on biomass production in this species is limited. To characterize and evaluate endophytic fungi in switchgrass, tillers were collected from a range of habitats across Indiana and Illinois in 2008 and 2009. Endophytic fungi were cultured from surface disinfected aboveground tissues. Morphological characters and sequences of the fungal ITS region were used to identify endophydc fungal isolates. In total, 31 operational taxonomic units were identified, representing fungi belonging to over 11 taxonomic orders. All fungi were members of Ascomycota and most belonged to common genera such as Alternaria, Epicoccum, Phoma, Phaeosphaeria and Stagonospora. No members of the Clavicipitaceae were detected. A greenhouse assay was carried out with a subset of endophyte isolates to determine their impacts on switchgrass biomass production. Experimental inoculations demonstrated that fungi had a range of effects on switchgrass biomass, with 12.5 % and 62.5 % of isolates significantly promoting versus reducing biomass production of test seedlings over controls. Some endophytic fungi of switchgrass may have potential to enhance plant productivity, but net effects of endophyte communities under field conditions need to be explored.

"Damping-off diseases caused huge losses in crop production in numerous countries. Pythium aphanidermatum represents a major cause of these diseases. In the present investigation, two endophytic fungi Talaromyces omanensis and Aspergillus fumigatus isolated from a desert plant, Rhazya stricta, were investigated for their efficiency in suppressing P. aphanidermatum and its stimulated damping-off diseases in cucumber and radish. The results proved the ability of both endophytes to inhibit P. aphanidermatum growth in both solid and liquid forms, inhibit its oospore production, induce abnormal patterns in its hyphae and suppress its induced damping-off diseases. Moreover, T. omanensis produced an inhibition zone area against P. aphanidermatum and enhanced the fresh weight of cucumber and length, fresh weight and dry weight of radish. Further, A. fumigatus caused cellular leakage in P. aphanidermatum mycelium. The previous results were interpreted through the secretion of beta-1,3-glucanase, cellulase and siderophore by both endophytic fungi.","J","Halo, BA; Al-Yahyai, RA; Al-Sadi, AM",NA,"","","A.

"Context: Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Labiatae) is a traditional Chinese herb. Endophytic fungi, which are biotic elicitors, can induce accumulation of secondary metabolites in their host plants. Objective: To analyze the interaction mechanism between S. miltiorrhiza and endophytic fungi. Materials and methods: Endophytic fungi U104 producing tanshinone IIA were isolated from the healthy disease-free tissue of root of S. miltiorrhiza by conventional methods. The endophytic fungus U104 of S. miltiorrhiza was co-cultured with the sterile seedlings of S. miltiorrhiza for 20?d (temp:day/night = 26??C/18??C, photoperiod:12/12?h, illuminance:2000?Lx). Transcriptome sequencing of S. miltiorrhiza seedlings after 20?d of co-cultivation was performed using the Illumina platform. Results: A total of 3713 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained. These different expression genes, such as STPII, LTP2, MYB transcription factors, CNGC, CDPK, Rboh, CaM, MAP2K1/MEK1, WRKY33, SGT1/SGT and Hsp90/htpG, showed that host S. miltiorrhiza had biological defence response in the initial stage of interaction. Under the induction of endophytic fungi, 14?key enzyme genes were up-regulated in the tanshinone biosynthesis pathway: DXS, DXS2, DXR, HMGR3, AACT, MK, PMK, GGPPS2, GPPS, KSL, IDI, IPII, FDPS and CPS. Discussion and conclusions: A total of 14?key genes were obtained from the tanshinone component synthesis and metabolic pathways, providing a reasonable explanation for the accumulation of tanshinone components, an accumulation induced by endophytic fungi, in the host plants. The large amounts of data generated in this study provide a strong and powerful platform for future functional and molecular studies of interactions between host plants and their endophytic fungi.","J","Jiang, Y; Wang, L; Lu, SR; Xue, YZ; Wei, XY; Lu, J; Zhang, YY",NA,"","","Jiang, Yan; Wang, Lei; Lu, Shaorong; Xue, Yizhe; Wei, Xiying; Lu, Juan; Zhang, Yanyan",NA,NA,"Transcriptome sequencing of Salvia miltiorrhiza after infection by its endophytic fungi and identification of genes related to tanshinone biosynthesis","PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1388-0209","1744-5116","",NA,NA,"JAN 1",2019,57,"1",NA,"","",NA,"760","769","","10.1080/13880209.2019.1680706","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13880209.2019.1680706","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31694427,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000494878600001","View Full Record in Web of Science",488,"Presence"
"Iron (Fe) deficiency in alkaline calcium soil is a problem that needs to be solved urgently as Fe is an essential and commonly limiting nutrient for plants. Endophytic fungus, Phomopsis liquidambaris (P. liquidambaris), has been reported to promote Fe absorption in peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.), however, the mechanisms remain unclear. Under prolonged Fe deficiency, an increase in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) often triggers a series of signaling events and leads to the inhibition of Fe acquisition. The main purpose of this study was to explore whether and how the endophytic fungus P. liquidambaris promote Fe absorption in peanut through regulating H2O2 and assisting in resisting oxidative stress. In this study, we detected the Fe deficiency-induced transcription factor (FIT), Fe2+ transporter (IRT1), and ferric reduction oxidase 2 (FRO2) of peanuts, and confirmed that they were negatively related to Fe concentration. Similarly, FIT, IRT1, and FRO2 were also inhibited by H2O2. The addition of P. liquidambaris reduces H2O2 under Fe-deficiency with an increase in Fe content, while the exogenous addition of H2O2 further decreases it, and the addition of catalase (CAT) under Fe-deficiency reverses this phenomenon. Through transcriptome analysis, we proved that the expression of FIT, IRT1, FRO2 and CAT are consistent with our hypothesis, and P. liquidambaris has a stress-mitigating effect on peanuts mainly via CAT, glutathione peroxidase, and malondialdehyde. Our study proved the Fe-absorption promoting effect and stress mitigation effect of P. liquidambaris under Fe-deficiency in peanuts, and their combined usage may help peanuts grow better","J","Du, YC; Kong, LJ; Cao, LS; Zhang, W; Zhu, Q; Ma, CY; Sun, K; Dai, CC",NA,"","","Du, Ying-Chun; Kong, Ling-Jie; Cao, Ling-Sen; Zhang, Wei; Zhu, Qiang; Ma, Chen-Yu; Sun, Kai; Dai, Chuan-Chao",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris Enhances Fe Absorption in Peanuts by Reducing Hydrogen Peroxide","FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-462X","","",NA,NA,"APR 29",2022,13,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","872242","10.3389/fpls.2022.872242","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.872242","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35574149,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000795660600001","View Full Record in Web of Science",489,"Presence"

"Dust storms have major effects on terrestrial ecosystems through the long-distance transport and deposition of particulate matter. It is unclear how dust deposition affects plant-associated microbiomes in downwind ecosystems. Here we show that dust deposition may negatively influence the isolation, richness, and diversity of endophytic fungal communities of Persian oak. We used culture-based methods paired with Sanger sequencing to examine these effects on fungal assemblages isolated from leaf, branch and deposited dust. Increased amounts of dust deposition led to decreased endophytic fungal diversity in plant tissues but increased fungal diversity in deposited dust layers on leaves. Dust deposition decreased the abundance of a dominant endophyte in branches with promising biocontrol properties. Endophytic fungal communities found in leaves were more similar to fungal assemblages of deposited dust in comparison to branch endophytes. Our results suggest that dust storms may have ecosystem-wide effects by altering the fungal microbiomes of forest-forming trees. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

"Baliospermum montanum (Willd.) Muell. Arg, a medicinal plant distributed throughout India from Kashmir to peninsular-Indian region is extensively used to treat jaundice, asthma, and constipation. In the current study, 203 endophytic fungi representing twenty-nine species were isolated from tissues of B. montanum. The colonization and isolation rate of endophytes were higher in stem followed by seed, root, leaf and flower. The phytochemical analysis revealed 70% endophytic isolates showed alkaloids and flavonoids, 13% were positive for phenols, saponins and terpenoids. Further, these endophytes produced remarkable extracellular enzymes such as amylase, cellulase, phosphates, protease and lipase. The most promisive three endophytic fungi were identified by ITS region and secreted metabolites were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). The GC-MS profile detected twenty-five bioactive compounds from ethyl acetate extracts. Among endophytic fungi, Trichoderma reesei isolated from flower exhibited nine bioactive compounds namely, 2-Cyclopentenone, 2-(4-chloroanilino)-4-piperidino, Oxime-methoxy-Phenyl, Methanamine N-hydroxy-N-methyl, Strychane, Cyclotetrasiloxane, Octamethyl and 1-Acetyl-20a-hydroxy-16-methylene. The endophyte, Aspergillus brasiliensis isolated from root and Fusarium oxysporum isolated from seed produced nine and seven bioactive compounds, respectively.

"Aims In this study, we sought to determine the pathogenic ability of endophytic fungi recovered from the spines of Calamus castaneus, a common rattan palm growing in the forests of Peninsula Malaysia. Methods and Results Ten endophytic fungal isolates were selected for pathogenicity tests: Colletotrichum boninense, Colletotrichum fructicola, Colletotrichum cliviae, Diaporthe hongkongensis, Diaporthe arengae, Diaporthe cf. nobilis, Neopestalotiopsis saprophytica, Neopestalotiopsis formicarum, Fusarium solani and Fusarium oxysporum. These endophytes were tested against leaves of bertam (Eugeissona sp.), oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) and mango (Mangiferae indica) and the fruits of chilli (Capsicum annum), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and banana (Musa acuminata). The fungal isolates showed infectivity against bertam, oil palm and mango leaves with degrees of virulence ranging from low to moderate, whereas infectivity against chilli, tomato and banana ranged from low to very high. Conclusions Fungal endophytes isolated from the spines of C. castaneus are pathogenic to different crop plants with differing degrees of virulence or aggressiveness. Significance and Impact of the Study Spines of C. castaneus can harbour fungal pathogens of a number of different crops as endophytes. The ability of the fungal endophytes to colonize and infect different crops demonstrate their importance towards agricultural crops. There is a possibility the endophytes behave as latent pathogen. When conditions become favourable, the fungal endophytes transform to pathogenic form and potentially infect other plants.","J","Azuddin, NF; Mohd, MH; Rosely, NFN; Mansor, A; Zakaria, L",NA,"","","Azuddin, Nurul Farizah; Mohd, Masratul Hawa; Rosely, Nik Fadzly Nik; Mansor, Asyraf; Zakaria, Latiffah",NA,NA,"Evaluation of the pathogenicity of endophytic fungi isolated from spines of rattan (Calamus castaneus) against other plant hosts","JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Azuddin, Nurul Farizah/AAV-7012-2021; MOHD, MASRATUL HAWA/C-4032-2016; Fadzly, Nik/E-4100-2010","Azuddin, Nurul Farizah/0000-0002-3638-3993; MOHD, MASRATUL HAWA/0000-0003-2250-2821; Mansor, Asyraf/0000-0003-1255-7239; Fadzly, Nik/0000-0002-6282-8423; Zakaria, Latiffah/0000-0002-2388-1424",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1364-5072","1365-2672","",NA,NA,"NOV",2022,133,"5",NA,"","",NA,"3228","3238","","10.1111/jam.15777","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.15777","","AUG 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35957553,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000843221500001","View Full Record in Web of Science",493,"Presence"
"Fungal endophytes are friendly microorganisms that colonize plants and are important in the interactions between plants and their environment. They generate valuable secondary metabolites that are valuable to both plants and humans. Endophytic fungi with bioactivities were isolated from the leaves of the medicinal plant Ziziphus spina-christi. An efficient isolate was selected and identified as Pestalotiopsis neglecta based on nucleotide sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS 1-5.8S-ITS 2) of the 18S rRNA gene (NCBI accession number OP529850); the 564 bp had 99 to 100% similarity with P. neglecta MH860161.1, AY682935.1, KP689121.1, and MG572407.1, according to the BLASTn analysis, following preliminary phytochemical and antifungal screening. The biological activities of this fungus' crude ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract were assessed. With an efficient radical scavenging activity against 2,2 '-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and an IC50 value of 36.6 mu g mL(-1), P. neglecta extract has shown its potential as an antioxidant. Moreover, it displayed notable cytotoxic effects against MCF-7 (breast carcinoma, IC50 = 22.4 mu g mL(-1)), HeLa (cervical carcinoma, IC50 = 28.9 mu g mL(-1)) and HepG-2 (liver carcinoma, IC50 = 28.9 mu g mL(-1)). At 10 mu g mL(-1), EtOAc demonstrated significant DNA protection against hydroxyl radical-induced damage. Based on FT-IR and GC-MS spectral analysis, it was detected that the EtOAc of P. neglecta product contains multiple bioactive functional groups. Subsequently, this validated the features of major different potent compounds; tolycaine, 1H-pyrazol, 1,3,5-trimethyl-, eugenol, 2,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-dione, 2,6-bis(1,1-dimethyl), and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate. Since these compounds are biologically relevant in various aspects, and distinct biological activities of fungal extract were acceptable in vitro, this suggests that endophytic fungus P. neglecta may be a viable source of bioactive natural products. This could be a good starting point for pharmaceutical applications.","J","Almustafa, HI; Yehia, RS",NA,"","","Almustafa, Hibah I.; Yehia, Ramy S.",NA,NA,"Antioxidant, Cytotoxic, and DNA Damage Protection Activities of Endophytic Fungus Pestalotiopsis neglecta Isolated from Ziziphus spina-christi Medicinal Plant","MICROORGANISMS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2076-2607","",NA,NA,"JAN",2023,11,"1",NA,"","",NA,"","","117","10.3390/microorganisms11010117","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11010117","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36677409,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000916255600001","View Full Record in Web of Science",494,"Presence"
"The study aimed to characterize a novel vitexin-producing endophytic fungus Fusarium solani G6 from Cajanus cajan, improve its capability for producing vitexin and evaluate its osteoblastic proliferation activity. A total of 153 endophytic fungi, classified into 6 genera, were isolated from C. cajan. Among them, only one strain, endophyte G6 identified as Fusarium solani, was found to produce vitexin. After the optimization of fermentation conditions, the highest vitexin yield (18.72 mg/L) for the strain was observed in PDB liquid medium containing 20.54 g/L of glucose and 8.90 g/L of ammonium sulfate, at an initial medium pH of 5.1 and at 28 degrees C for 6 days of cultivation. Moreover, the fungal vitexin exhibited notable osteoblastic proliferation stimulating activity.

"Endophytic fungi are thought to interact mutualistically with host plants by producing alkaloid metabolites that deter herbivory. Since such fungi are transmitted via seed in some grasses, the presence of endophytes may also protect plants from seed predators. We conducted seed choice experiments for two dominant seed harvesting ants, Pogonomyrmex rugosus in the Sonoran desert and Pogonomyrmex occidentalis at a higher elevation, riparian zone in Arizona, USA. Noninfected fescue (Festuca arundinacea) seeds and seeds infected with the endophytic fungus, Acremonium coenophialum, were presented to ant colonies in three different populations. Infected seeds were harvested less frequently than non-infected seed for the two populations of Pogonomyrmex rugosus but not for the population of Pogonomyrmex occidentalis. We also a conducted seed dispersal experiment for one population of Pogonomyrmex rugosus. Of the seeds that were harvested. most of the colonies discarded more infected seeds into refuse piles than expected by chance. Seeds discarded into refuse piles have greater germination success than surrounding areas. The most important interaction of endophytes and grasses may be deterrence of seed predation and enhancing the probability of germinating in favorable sites, since these processes directly increase plant fitness.","J","KNOCH, TR; FAETH, SH; ARNOTT, DL",NA,"","","KNOCH, TR; FAETH, SH; ARNOTT, DL",NA,NA,"ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI ALTER FORAGING AND DISPERSAL BY DESERT SEED-HARVESTING ANTS","OECOLOGIA","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Arnott, Diane L/J-5820-2015","Arnott, Diane/0000-0002-9272-2363",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0029-8549","1432-1939","",NA,NA,"OCT",1993,95,"4",NA,"","",NA,"470","473","","10.1007/BF00317429","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00317429","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28313285,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1993MB23600003","View Full Record in Web of Science",496,"Presence"
"BackgroundTo explore the community composition and diversity of the endophytic fungi in Taxillus chinensis, samples of the parasites growing on seven different hosts, Morus alba, Prunus salicina, Phellodendron chinense, Bauhinia purpurea, Dalbergia odorifera, Diospyros kaki and Dimocarpus longan, were isolated. The strains were identified by their morphological characteristics and their internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences.Results150 different endophytic fungi were isolated from the haustorial roots of the seven hosts with a total isolation rate of 61.24%. These endophytic fungi were found to belong to 1 phylum, 2 classes, 7 orders, 9 families, 11 genera and 8 species. Among of them, Pestalotiopsis, Neopestalotiopsis and Diaporthe were the dominant genera, accounting for 26.67, 17.33 and 31.33% of the total number of strains, respectively. Diversity and similarity analyses showed that the endophytic fungi isolated from D. longan (H'=1.60) had the highest diversity index. The highest richness indexes were found in M. alba and D. odorifera (both 2.23). The evenness index of D. longan was the highest (0.82). The similarity coefficient of D. odorifera was the most similar to D. longan and M. alba (33.33%), while the similarity coefficient of P. chinense was the lowest (7.69%) with M. alba and D. odorifera. Nine strains showed antimicrobial activities. Among them, Pestalotiopsis sp., N. parvum and H. investiens showed significant antifungal activity against three fungal phytopathogens of medicinal plants. At the same time, the crude extracts from the metabolites of the three endophytic fungi had strong inhibitory effects on the three pathogens. Pestalotiopsis sp., N. parvum and H. investiens had the strongest inhibitory effects of S. cucurbitacearum, with inhibitory rates of 100%, 100% and 81.51%, respectively. In addition, N. parvum had a strong inhibitory effect on D. glomerata and C. cassicola, with inhibitory rates of 82.35% and 72.80%, respectively.ConclusionsThese results indicate that the species composition and diversity of endophytic fungi in the branches of T. chinensis were varied in the different hosts and showed good antimicrobial potential in the control of plant pathogens.","J","Song, LS; Huo, J; Wan, LY; Pan, LM; Jiang, N; Fu, J; Wei, SG; He, LL",NA,"","","Song, Li-sha; Huo, Juan; Wan, Lingyun; Pan, Limei; Jiang, Ni; Fu, Jine; Wei, Shugen; He, Lili",NA,NA,"Differences and biocontrol potential of haustorial endophytic fungi from Taxillus Chinensis on different host plants","BMC MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1471-2180","","",NA,NA,"MAY 13",2023,23,"1",NA,"","",NA,"","","128","10.1186/s12866-023-02878-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12866-023-02878-x","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37173641,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000985744900002","View Full Record in Web of Science",497,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi of medicinal plants have attracted wide attention due to their various active biochemical substances that are similar to those of the host plants and can be easily fermented and cultured. As a traditional medicine and food homologous plant in Xinjiang, Brassica rapa L. has a long history of applications. Recently, it has been shown that B. rapa L. has hypoglycemic, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant properties. However, there are no studies on the function and diversity of enophytic fungi of B. rapa L. Four endophytic fungus (pr6, pr7, pr8, and pr10) strains were isolated from B. rapa L. in our laboratory. The metabolic extracts from pr10 have significant effects in terms of antitumor activity. In this study, in terms of types and contents, compared with those of the other three endophytic fungi, the dominant metabolites of pr10 were determined by comparative metabolomics analysis. The results of metabolomics analysis indicated that the metabolites of pr10 are rich in amino acids and sugar derivatives such as trehalose, whose ability to inhibit the A549 cell line has been proved. This study provides a theoretical basis for the development and utilization of B. rapa L. and its endophytic fungi to form antitumor agents.","J","Wei, J; Chen, F; Liu, YM; Abudoukerimu, A; Zheng, Q; Zhang, XB; Sun, YP; Yimiti, D",NA,"","","Wei, Jie; Chen, Feng; Liu, Yumei; Abudoukerimu, Azierguli; Zheng, Qian; Zhang, Xiaobo; Sun, Yuping; Yimiti, Delixiati",NA,NA,"Comparative Metabolomics Revealed the Potential Antitumor Characteristics of Four Endophytic Fungi of Brassica rapa L.","ACS OMEGA","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"wei, jie/AAM-4724-2020","wei, jie/0000-0002-1283-4526",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2470-1343","","",NA,NA,"MAR 24",2020,5,"11",NA,"","",NA,"5939","5950","","10.1021/acsomega.9b04258","http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.9b04258","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32226874,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000521782400040","View Full Record in Web of Science",498,"Presence"
"Stellera chamaejasme L. is a widely distributed poisonous plant in Chinese degraded grasslands. To investigate the role of endophytic fungi (EF) in S. chamaejasme's quick spread in grasslands, the endophytic fungal community of S. chamaejasme was studied through culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, and the plant-growth-promoting (PGP) traits of some culturable isolates were tested. Further, the growth-promoting effects of 8 isolates which showed better PGP traits were evaluated by pot experiments. The results showed that a total of 546 culturable EF were isolated from 1114 plant tissue segments, and the colonization rate (CR) of EF in roots (33.27%) was significantly higher than that in shoots (22.39%). Consistent with this, the number of specific types of EF was greater in roots (8 genera) than in shoots (1 genus). The same phenomenon was found in culture-independent study. There were 95 specific genera found in roots, while only 18 specific genera were found in shoots. In addition, the dominant EF were different between the two study methods. Cladosporium (18.13%) and Penicillium (15.93%) were the dominant EF in culture-dependent study, while Apiotrichum (13.21%) and Athelopsis (5.62%) were the dominant EF in culture-independent study. PGP trait tests indicated that 91.30% of the tested isolates (69) showed phosphorus solubilization, IAA production, or siderophores production activity. The benefit of 8 isolates on host plants' growth was further studied by pot experiments, and the results indicated that all of the isolates can improve host plants' growth. Among them, STL3G74 (Aspergillus niger) showed the best growth-promotion effect; it can increase the plant's shoot and root dry biomass by 68.44% and 74.50%, respectively, when compared with the controls. Our findings revealed that S. chamaejasme has a wide range of fungal endophytic assemblages, and most of them possess PGP activities, which may play a key role in its quick spread in degraded grasslands.","J","Tang, WT; Gong, WJ; Xiao, RT; Mao, WQ; Zhao, LZ; Song, JZ; Awais, M; Ji, XL; Li, HY",NA,"","","Tang, Wenting; Gong, Weijun; Xiao, Ruitong; Mao, Wenqin; Zhao, Liangzhou; Song, Jinzhao; Awais, Muhammad; Ji, Xiuling; Li, Haiyan",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungal Community of Stellera chamaejasme L. and Its Possible Role in Improving Host Plants' Ecological Flexibility in Degraded Grasslands","JOURNAL OF FUNGI","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"jiang, lei/IWE-1124-2023","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2309-608X","",NA,NA,"APR",2023,9,"4",NA,"","",NA,"","","465","10.3390/jof9040465","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof9040465","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37108919,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000977755100001","View Full Record in Web of Science",499,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi Cladosporium cladosporioides (F1-MH810309) and Cladosporium tenuissimum (F2-MN715834) from the leaf of wild Cymbopogon martinii (MT90507) were isolated and selected based on the persistent occurrence during different seasons of the year. They were identified based on the morphological features and molecular characterization (ITS sequence), and later deposited at NCBI. Phytochemical studies on F1, F2 and host extracts showed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, terpenoids and tannins. The GC-MS of F1 extract (control) under the axenic condition revealed compounds like hexadecane, heptadecane,2,4-Ditert-butylphenol, E-14 hexadecenal, geraniol, geranyl acetate and cubenol similar to the host. The GC-MS of F2 extract (control) revealed metabolites that were unique. Further, both F1 and F2 were cultured in the supplementation of different concentrations (5%, 10%, 15% and 20%) of the host plant extract (an-axenic condition). The GC-MS of F1 extracts (test) exhibited good growth and showed the gradual increased production of terpenoid compounds whereas the F2 (test) did not show any growth. These compounds such as hyrdoxymenthol, nor-borneol, cedralacetate, alpha-cyclogeraniol, campesterol, beta-cyclogeraniol, linalool oxide,2,3-boranediol, citronellyltiglate and 2,3-pinanediol were produced in a minor quantity and were known as biotransformed forms of the precursor compounds present in the host extract. In comparison, only F1 was able to produce terpenoids similar to the host species both in axenic and an-axenic conditions. Hence from the current study, the endophytic fungus F1 isolated from wild C. martinii for the first time can serve as a better resource for the bioprospection of an important terpenoid and its metabolites.","J","Jayaram, H; Marigowda, V; Saraswathi, KJT",NA,"","","Jayaram, Hemalatha; Marigowda, Vinutha; Thara Saraswathi, Kunigal Jagadishchandra",NA,NA,"Secondary Metabolite Production and Terpenoid Biosynthesis in Endophytic Fungi Cladosporium cladosporioides Isolated from Wild Cymbopogon martinii (Roxb.)

"Candida albicans is a most common cause of fungal infections in animals and birds. Understanding the increasing resistance of C. albicans to various antifungal therapeutic agents is important to discover new anti-candidal alternatives. The present study investigated the anti-candidal potential of five endophytic fungi extracts, isolated from the tropical ethnoveterinary plant, Calotropis gigantea. We firstly evaluated the in vitro antifungal activities of endophytic fungi extracts by the well diffusion method. Secondly, the cells of C. albicans were treated with the potent extract to observe significant ultrastructural changes. To further investigate the in vivo antifungal activity of the extract, some laboratory experiments with mice were undertaken, and posteriourly, the different organs were studied under the electron microscope for any deformities. Phomopsis asparagi showed the best anti-candidal activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 46.9 mu g/mL. The fungal test pathogen (C. albicans) exhibited various cell deformities when treated with the extract of P. asparagi. Histopathological studies of the vital organs of mice treated with the potent fungal extract did not show any significant pathological conditions when viewed under scanning electron microscope. Thus, P. asparagi can be a potential candidate for anti-candidal agents against C. albicans. Future studies will focus on the isolation of the bioactive components of the extract.","J","Nath, A; Joshi, S",NA,"","","Nath, Archana; Joshi, Santaram",NA,NA,"Anti-candidal effect of endophytic fungi isolated from Calotropis gigantea","REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Joshi/F-2097-2015","Joshi, Santa Ram/0000-0001-8080-484X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0034-7744","2215-2075","",NA,NA,"DEC",2017,65,"4",NA,"","",NA,"1437","1447","","10.15517/rbt.v65i4.26269","http://dx.doi.org/10.15517/rbt.v65i4.26269","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000418999900016","View Full Record in Web of Science",505,"Presence"
"Many wild ornamental plant species have been introduced to improve the landscape of cities; however, until now, no study has been performed to explore the composition and function of foliar endophytes associated with cultivated rare plants in cities after their introduction. In this study, we collected the leaves of the healthy ornamental plant Lirianthe delavayi from wild and artificially cultivated habitats in Yunnan and compared their diversity, species composition, and functional predictions of their foliar endophytic fungal community based on high-throughput sequencing technology. In total, 3125 ASVs of fungi were obtained. The alpha diversity indices of wild L. delavayi populations are similar to those of cultivated samples; however, the species compositions of endophytic fungal ASVs were significantly varied in the two habitats. The dominant phylum is Ascomycota, accounting for more than 90% of foliar endophytes in both populations; relatively, artificial cultivation trends to increase the frequency of common phytopathogens of L. delavayi, such as Alternaria, Erysiphe. The relative abundance of 55 functional predictions is different between wild and cultivated L. delavayi leaves (p < 0.05); in particular, chromosome, purine metabolism, and peptidases are significantly increased in wild samples, while flagellar assembly, bacterial chemotaxis, and fatty acid metabolism are significantly enhanced in cultivated samples. Our results indicated that artificial cultivation can greatly change the foliar endophytic fungal community of L. delavayi, which is valuable for understanding the influence of the domestication process on the foliar fungal community associated with rare ornamental plants in urban environments.","J","Wu, NN; Zeng, ZY; Xu, QB; Zhang, HB; Xu, T",NA,"","","Wu, Nan-Nan; Zeng, Zhao-Ying; Xu, Qin-Bin; Zhang, Han-Bo; Xu, Tao",NA,NA,"Artificial Cultivation Changes Foliar Endophytic Fungal Community of the Ornamental Plant Lirianthe delavayi","MICROORGANISMS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Wu, Nannan/0000-0002-6154-2503",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2076-2607","",NA,NA,"MAR",2023,11,"3",NA,"","",NA,"","","775","10.3390/microorganisms11030775","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11030775","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36985348,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000958167700001","View Full Record in Web of Science",506,"Presence"

"It is know that many plants live in symbiosis with microorganisms that can be found on their interior, the endophytes. Environment and tissue type are modulating factors of this community, in which most of these microorganisms produce important antimicrobial molecules and they may be powerful biocontrol agents in agriculture. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the community of Endophytic fungi from Eremanthus erythropappus in anthropogenic and natural areas (with human interaction, natural habitat and planned planting) of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, through cultivation-based approach and verify their antimicrobial activity against phytopathogenic fungal and pathogenic bacteria. The endophytic fungi isolated were identified by sequencing of the ITS region and subjected an in vitro antagonism test. The antagonisms that show antibiosis were submitted to tests on split plates to verify the volatile compound production. In the pairing testes, the endophytic fungi of the genera Cryptosporiopsis, Diaporthe, Xylaria, Paraconiothyrium and Camarosporium presented antibiosis against phytopathogenic fungi by releasing compounds in the medium. To our knowledge, this paper is the first report on the isolation of twelve genera fungi in E erythropappus besides verifying their antagonist capacity, which opens the way for discovery of bioactive substances produced by endophytic fungi that inhibit pathogens.","J","Godinho, BTV; Santos, IAFM; Gomes, EA; Piccoli, RH; Cardoso, PG",NA,"","","Vilarino Godinho, Barbara Temponi; Ferrer Melo Santos, Italo Augusto; Gomes, Eliane Aparecida; Piccoli, Roberta Hilsdorf; Cardoso, Patricia Gomes",NA,NA,"ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI COMMUNITY IN Eremarrthus erythropappus TREE FROM ANTHROPOGENIC AND NATURAL AREAS OF MINAS GERAIS","CERNE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cardoso, Patrícia/AAV-6174-2021","Cardoso, Patrícia/0000-0002-0797-2502; Augusto Ferrer Melo Santos, Italo/0000-0001-5433-3562",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0104-7760","","",NA,NA,"JUL-AUG",2019,25,"3",NA,"","",NA,"283","293","","10.1590/01047760201925032642","http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/01047760201925032642","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000503860800003","View Full Record in Web of Science",508,"Presence"
"The diversity and plant growth-promoting ability of endophytic fungi associated with the five flower plant species growing in Yunnan, Southwest China, were investigated. A total of 357 culturable endophytic fungi were isolated from 1000 segments of healthy leaves and stems of the five plant species. Based on the morphological characteristics and the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) analysis, the isolates were identified to 24 taxa, of which Alternaria, Phomopsis, Cladosporium, and Colletotrichum were the dominant genera. The Sorenson's coefficient similarity indices of the endophytic fungi from the five flower plant species ranged from 0.36 to 0.80. It was found that the similarity index between two cultivated flowers (0.8) or the similarity index between two wild flowers (0.71-0.76) was higher than the similarity index between one cultivated flower and one wild flower (0.36-0.48). The Shannon indices (H) of the endophytic fungi from the five plant species ranged from 1.73 to 2.45, and the diversity indices of the wild flowers were higher than those of the cultivated flowers.

"Rohitukine, a chromone alkaloid, has gained considerable international attention in recent years because of its novel semi-synthetic derivative, flavopiridol and P-276-00. Both these molecules are in advanced stages of clinical development and trial for cancer treatment. Recently, flavopiridol was approved as an orphan drug for treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cancer. The natural occurrence of rohitukine is restricted to only four plant species, Amoora rohituka and Dysoxylum binectarzferum (both from the Meliaceae family) and from Schumanniophyton magnificum and Schumanniophyton pro blematicum (both from the Rubiaceae family). Recently, an endophytic fungi isolated from D. binectanferum was reported to produce rohitukine in culture. In this study, we report the production of rohitukine and its subsequent attenuation by endophytic fungi, Fusarium oxysporum (MTCC-11383), Fasarium oxysporum (MTCC-11384) and Fusarium solani (MTCC-11385), all isolated from D. binectanferum and Gibberella fujikuroi (MTCC11382) isolated from Amoora rohituka. The fungal rohitukine which was analyzed by HPLC, LC-MS and LC-MS/MS was identical to reference rohitukine and that produced by the plant. The rohitukine content in the mycelial samples ranged from 192.78m to 359.55 tig 100 g-1 of dry weight of and in broth it ranged from 14.10 to 71.901.1,g 100 m1-1. In all the fungal cultures, the production declined from first to fourth sub-culture. Studies are underway to unravel the mechanism by which the fungi produce the host metabolite in culture.

"In the pursuit of sustainable agriculture through environment and human health friendly practices, we evaluated the potential of a novel gibberellins (GAs) producing basidiomycetous endophytic fungus Porostereum spadiceum AGH786, for alleviating salt stress and promoting health benefits of soybean. Soybean seedlings exposed to different levels of NaCl stress (70 and 140 mM) under greenhouse conditions, were inoculated with the AGH786 strain. Levels of phytohormones including GAs, JA and ABA, and isoflavones were compared in control and the inoculated seedlings to understand the mechanism through which the stress is alleviated. Gibberellins producing endophytic fungi have been vital for promoting plant growth under normal and stress conditions. We report P. spadiceum AGH786 as the ever first GAs producing basidiomycetous fungus capable of producing six types of GAs. In comparison to the so for most efficient GAs producing Gibberella fujikuroi, AGH786 produced significantly higher amount of the bioactive GA(3). Salt-stressed phenotype of soybean seedlings was characterized by low content of GAs and high amount of ABA and JA with reduced shoot length, biomass, leaf area, chlorophyll contents, and rate of photosynthesis. Mitigation of salt stress by AGH786 was always accompanied by high GAs, and low ABA and JA, suggesting that this endophytic fungus reduces the effect of salinity by modulating endogenous phytohormones of the seedlings. Additionally, this strain also enhanced the endogenous level of two isoflavones including daidzen and genistein in soybean seedlings under normal as well as salt stress conditions as compared to their respective controls. P. spadiceum AGH786 boosted the NaCl stress tolerance and growth in soybean, by modulating seedlings endogenous phytohormones and isoflavones suggesting a valuable contribution of this potent fungal biofertilizer in sustainable agriculture in salt affected soils.","J","Hamayun, M; Hussain, A; Khan, SA; Kim, HY; Khan, AL; Waqas, M; Irshad, M; Iqbal, A; Rehman, G; Jan, S; Lee, IJ",NA,"","","Hamayun, Muhammad; Hussain, Anwar; Khan, Sumera A.; Kim, Ho-Youn; Khan, Abdul L.; Waqas, Muhammad; Irshad, Muhammad; Iqbal, Amjad; Rehman, Gauhar; Jan, Samin; Lee, In-Jung",NA,NA,"Gibberellins Producing Endophytic Fungus Porostereum spadiceum AGH786 Rescues Growth of Salt Affected Soybean","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hamayun, Muhammad/B-1694-2010; Rehman, Gauhar/AAW-9173-2020; Iqbal, Amjad/E-2010-2014; Waqas, Muhammad/IYS-9931-2023; Lee, In-Jung/GLS-0432-2022; Hussain, Anwar/N-1605-2019","Hamayun, Muhammad/0000-0003-4264-5870; Rehman, Gauhar/0000-0001-8059-9591; Iqbal, Amjad/0000-0001-6141-8337; Lee, In-Jung/0000-0001-7154-4820; Hussain, Anwar/0000-0002-2539-2843; Khan, Abdul Latif/0000-0001-9700-8903",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1664-302X","",NA,NA,"APR 20",2017,8,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","686","10.3389/fmicb.2017.00686","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.00686","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28473818,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000399532400002","View Full Record in Web of Science",513,"Presence"

Primary screening was done by antibacterial and antifungal reactions, and the strain reselection was done with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to identify the fermentation products of the selected strains. Extracts of the leaf and cortex of Eucommia ulmoides Oliver were also deteted by HPLC, then positive results of HPLC were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS. In this study, 29 strains were isolated from Eucommia ulmoides Oliver. Most of them had antibacterial activity, and a few of them had antifungal activity. One ingredient of the B5 extract had a retention time identical to that of authentic chlorogenic acid. With GC-MS, other ingredients, isocoumarin and p-chlorocinnamide, were found. With LC-MS, chlorogenic acid and geniposide related to Eucommia ulmoides Oliver were found. The strain B5 was identified as Sordariomycete sp. Thus, endophytic fungi may produce the bioactive compound chlorogenic acid, as their host plant does, and could be used for the production of chlorogenic acid by fermentation in the future.","J","Chen, XM; Sang, XX; Li, SH; Zhang, SJ; Bai, LH",NA,"","","Chen, Xiaomin; Sang, Xiaoxue; Li, Shaohe; Zhang, Shujun; Bai, Linhan",NA,NA,"Studies on a chlorogenic acid-producing endophytic fungi isolated from Eucommia ulmoides Oliver","JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Chen, Xiaomin/Z-2734-2019","Chen, Xiaomin/0000-0002-9731-6989",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1367-5435","1476-5535","",NA,NA,"MAY",2010,37,"5",NA,"","",NA,"447","454","","10.1007/s10295-010-0690-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10295-010-0690-0","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20127271,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000276722200003","View Full Record in Web of Science",516,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi became an attractive source for the discovery of new leads, because of the complexity and the structural diversity of their secondary metabolites. The genus Fusarium comprising about 70 species is extremely variable in terms of genetics, biology, ecology, and consequently, secondary metabolism and have been isolated from countless plants genera from diverse habitats. These endophytic microbes may provide protection and survival strategies in their host plants with production of a repertoire of chemically diverse and structurally unprecedented secondary metabolites reported to exhibit an incredible array of biological activities including antimicrobial, anticancer, antiviral, antioxidants, antiparasitics, immunosuppressants, immunomodulatory, antithrombotic, and biocontrol ability against plants pathogens and nematodes.

"Medicinal plants are an important source of bioactive compounds and have been used to isolate various bioactive compounds having industrial applications. The demand for plants derived bioactive molecules is increasing gradually. However, the extensive use of these plants to extract bioactive molecules has threatened many plant species. Moreover, extracting bioactive molecules from these plants is laborious, costly, and time-consuming. So, some alternative sources and strategies are urgently needed to produce these bioactive molecules similar to that of plant origin. However, the interest in new bioactive molecules has recently shifted from plants to endophytic fungi because many fungi produce bioactive molecules similar to their host plant. Endophytic fungi live in mutualistic association within the healthy plant tissue without causing disease symptoms to the host plant. These fungi are a treasure house of novel bioactive molecules having broad pharmaceutical, industrial, and agricultural applications. The rapid increase in publications in this domain over the last three decades proves that natural product biologists and chemists are paying great attention to the natural bioactive products from endophytic fungi. Though endophytes are source of novel bioactive molecules but there is need of advanced technologies like clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) and epigenetic modifiers to enhance the production of compounds having industrial applications. This review provides an overview of the various industrial applications of bioactive molecules produced by endophytic fungi and the rationale behind selecting specific plants for fungal endophyte isolation. Overall, this study presents the current state of knowledge and highlights the potential of endophytic fungi for developing alternative therapies for drug-resistant infections.","J","Anand, K; Kumar, V; Prasher, IB; Sethi, M; Raj, H; Ranjan, H; Chand, S; Pandey, GK",NA,"","","Anand, Kumar; Kumar, Vijay; Prasher, Indu Bhushan; Sethi, Megha; Raj, Harsh; Ranjan, Himanshu; Chand, Subhash; Pandey, Gaurav Kumar",NA,NA,"Bioactive molecules from fungal endophytes and their applications in pharmaceutical industries: challenges and future scope","JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Kumar, Vijay/0000-0001-7935-3711",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0233-111X","1521-4028","",NA,NA,"JUL",2023,63,"7",NA,"","SI",NA,"690","708","","10.1002/jobm.202200696","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.202200696","","MAR 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36998101,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000961385800001","View Full Record in Web of Science",519,"Review"
"To obtain secondary metabolites with diverse structures, the chemical investigations of a plant endophytic fungus Alternaria sp. LS-Y-1 was carried out. Five known compounds were separated from the fermentation product of LS-Y-1 by chromatographic separation techniques. Based on the results of H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR spectrometry, their structures were determined as 2,4-dimethyldodecan-1-ol (1), mannitol (2), 4-O-beta-D-gal-actopyranosyl-erythritol (3), alternariol 9-O-methyl ether (4), allantoin (5). Then, the contact toxicities and feeding deterrent activities of compounds 1-5 were evaluated, and the results of bioassays showed that 4-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-erythritol (3) exerted good feeding deterrent activities against T. castaneum. The feeding deterrence index (FDI) of 4-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-erythritol (3) can reach up to 84.62% when concentrations were 2 mg/mL, while contact toxicity assays showed that alternariol 9-O-methyl ether (4) exhibited most noticeable contact activity against the adults of T. castaneum (lethal dose 50 (LD50 = 38.26 mg/adult). Furthermore, mannitol (2) and 9-O-methyl ether (4) exhibited synergistic activity against T. castaneum at a 6:2 ratio. Altogether, the results demonstrated that plant endophytic fungi have great potential in the research of new anti-insect active substances and have certain research value in the green control of tradi-tional Chinese medicine pests.

"Background: Endophytic fungi play an important role in balancing the ecosystem and boosting host growth. In the present study, we investigated the endophytic fungal diversity of healthy Panax notoginseng and evaluated its potential antimicrobial activity against five major phytopathogens causing rootrot of P. notoginseng. Methods: A culture-dependent technique, combining morphological and molecular methods, was used to analyze endophytic fungal diversity. A double-layer agar technique was used to challenge the phytopathogens of P. notoginseng. Results: A total of 89 fungi were obtained from the roots, stems, leaves, and seeds of P. notoginseng, and 41 isolates representing different morphotypes were selected for taxonomic characterization. The fungal isolates belonged to Ascomycota (96.6%) and Zygomycota (3.4%). All isolates were classified to 23 genera and an unknown taxon belonging to Sordariomycetes. The number of isolates obtained from different tissues ranged from 12 to 42 for leaves and roots, respectively. The selected endophytic fungal isolates were challenged by the root-rot pathogens Alternaria panax, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, Phoma herbarum, and Mycocentrospora acerina. Twenty-six of the 41 isolates (63.4%) exhibited activity against at least one of the pathogens tested. Conclusion: Our results suggested that P. notoginseng harbors diversified endophytic fungi that would provide a basis for the identification of new bioactive compounds, and for effective biocontrol of notoginseng root rot.

"Salvia miltiorrhiza is a traditional medicinal plant mainly used for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease treatment. Tanshinones are the main bioactive constituents of S. miltiorrhiza, which mainly accumulate around its root periderm tissue. Endophytic fungi are important bioelicitors or probiotics that can promote the accumulation of secondary metabolites and sustainable cultivation of medicinal plants. Among them, endophytic Cladosporium spp., possessing a variety of biotransformation and metabolic abilities, is an ideal elicitor source. Here, we used a gnotobiotic system to investigate the effects of the endophytic fungus Cladosporium tenuissimum DF11 on tanshinone biosynthesis in S. miltiorrhiza roots. The results showed that C. tenuissimum DF11 mainly colonizes the intercellular space of the root tissues and promotes tanshinone biosynthesis and accumulation in S. miltiorrhiza roots by upregulating the expression of the genes encoding for key enzymes HMGR, DXS, DXR, GGPPS, CPS, KSL and CYP76AH1 of the tanshinone biosynthesis pathway. The expression levels of almost all genes encoding for key enzymes reached the response peak in the first or second week after DF11 colonization. Taken together, the endophytic fungus C. tenuissimum DF11 could promote secondary metabolite accumulation in S. miltiorrhiza roots. These results indicate that DF11 will be a potential biofertilizer fungus to regulate and stabilize the quality of cultivated S. miltiorrhiza medicinal materials.","J","Chen, HM; Chen, JL; Qi, Y; Chu, SY; Ma, Y; Xu, LN; Lv, SY; Zhang, HH; Yang, DF; Zhu, YH; Mans, DR; Liang, ZS",NA,"","","Chen, Haimin; Chen, Jialing; Qi, Yao; Chu, Siyuan; Ma, Yao; Xu, Linna; Lv, Shiyi; Zhang, Haihua; Yang, Dongfeng; Zhu, Yonghong; Mans, Dennis Ra; Liang, Zongsuo",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungus Cladosporium tenuissimum DF11, an efficient inducer of tanshinone biosynthesis in Salvia miltiorrhiza roots","PHYTOCHEMISTRY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"liu, li/HGC-0900-2022; Mans, Dennis/GQP-0917-2022; Chen, Jia-Ling/F-2742-2010","Mans, Dennis/0000-0001-5080-5227; Chen, Haimin/0000-0002-5794-5254; Ma, Yao/0000-0003-0393-5269",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0031-9422","1873-3700","",NA,NA,"FEB",2022,194,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","113021","10.1016/j.phytochem.2021.113021","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2021.113021","","NOV 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34826795,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000723419500008","View Full Record in Web of Science",525,"Presence"

Apart from its use in the biopharmaceutical industry, it is also used to reduce the formation of a carcinogenic substance called acrylamide in fried, baked, and roasted foods. L-asparaginase is derived from many organisms including plants, bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes. Currently, L-asparaginase preparations from Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi are used in the clinical treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, they are associated with low yield and immunogenicity problems. At this juncture, endophytic fungi from medicinal plants have gained much attention as they have several advantages over the available bacterial preparations. Many medicinal plants have been screened for L-asparaginase producing endophytic fungi and several studies have reported potent L-asparaginase producing strains. This review provides insights into fungal endophytes from medicinal plants and their significance as probable alternatives for bacterial L-asparaginase.","J","Parashiva, J; Nuthan, BR; Rakshith, D; Satish, S",NA,"","","Parashiva, Javaraiah; Nuthan, Bettadapura Rameshgowda; Rakshith, Devaraju; Satish, Sreedharamurthy",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungi as a Promising Source of Anticancer L-Asparaginase: A Review","CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Satish, Sreedharamurthy/0000-0003-1164-4701",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0343-8651","1432-0991","",NA,NA,"SEP",2023,80,"9",NA,"","",NA,"","","282","10.1007/s00284-023-03392-z","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-023-03392-z","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37450223,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001030541200001","View Full Record in Web of Science",528,"Review"
"Background. Conyza blinii H. Lev is a medicinal plant that has a variety of pharmacological activities, but its study is at a standstill due to the shortage of resources. Method. This study utilized the surface sterilization method to isolate endophytic fungi, and they were preliminarily identified by morphology. Flavonoid-producing strains were screened by NaNO2-Al(NO)(3) colorimetry and further identified by the ITS sequence. Additionally, we used five antioxidant assays (DPPH, Hydroxyl radical, ABTS, FRAP and T-AOC assays) to systematically evaluate the antioxidant capacity of total flavonoids, and we also determined their antibacterial activity. Results. In this study, 21 endophytic fungi were isolated from wild Conyza blinii H. Lev for the first time. There were six flavonoid-producing strains, especially CBL11, whose total flavonoid content reached 50.78 +/- 2.4 mg/L. CBL12, CBL12-2 and CBL1-1 all exhibited excellent antioxidant activity. The effect of CBL12 was similar to that of ascorbic acid at low concentrations, and its radical scavenging rates for DPPH and ABTS were 94.56 +/- 0.29 % and 99.88 +/- 0.27%, respectively, while its IC50 values were only 0.11 +/- 0.01 mg/mL and 0.2 +/- 0.01 mg/mL. Through LC-MS, we found that CBL12 could produce many high-value flavonoids, such as 3-methoxyflavone, nobiletin, formononetin, scopoletin, and daidzein. Additionally, CBL9 had good antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Notably, we obtained the high-yield strains CBL12 and CBL9, which not only had high yields (10.64 +/- 1.01 mg/L and 10.17 +/- 0.11 mg/L, respectively) but also had excellent biological activity. Hence, the results of this study provide new ideas for endophytic fungi that can be exploited as a source of flavonoids and other medicinal components from Conyza blinii H. Lev. Moreover, this study can serve as a reference for the development of rare medicinal materials.","J","Tang, ZZ; Wang, YS; Yang, JY; Xiao, YR; Cai, Y; Wan, YJ; Chen, H; Yao, HP; Shan, Z; Li, CL; Wang, G",NA,"","","Tang, Zizhong; Wang, Yinsheng; Yang, Jingyu; Xiao, Yirong; Cai, Yi; Wan, Yujun; Chen, Hui; Yao, Huipeng; Shan, Zhi; Li, Chenglei; Wang, Gang",NA,NA,"Isolation and identification of flavonoid-producing endophytic fungi from medicinal plant Conyza blinii H.Lev that exhibit higher antioxidant and antibacterial activities","PEERJ","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wang, Yin/HCI-9352-2022; YANG, JINGYU/AAD-3341-2021","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2167-8359","","",NA,NA,"APR 15",2020,8,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","e8978","10.7717/peerj.8978","http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8978","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32328352,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000525836600005","View Full Record in Web of Science",529,"Presence"
"Aims: The aim of this study is to isolate and identify an endophytic fungus with antibacterial activity from the Asian medicinal and culinary plant Lilium lancifolium and to study the characteristics of its major antibacterial fractions. Methods and Results: After strict sample sterilization, an endophytic fungus BH-3 with great antibacterial activity against Leuconostoc mesenteroides was isolated from the bulbs of L. lancifolium and was identified as Fusarium oxysporum on the basis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA sequence and morphological traits. After partial purification including superfiltration and gel filtration, the major antibacterial fractions were found to be the substances with the molecular mass ranging from 35 to 60 kDa, mainly 55 kDa. The partially purified antibacterial fractions were stable at thermal processes, with more than 80% of activity left at 60 degrees C for 1 h, and even 70.75% left at 121 degrees C for 15 min. 90.33-98.97% of activity was observed in the pH range of 4.0-7.0. But the fractions were sensitive to different proteases. Conclusions: Endophytic strain F. oxysporum BH-3 isolated from the bulbs of L. lancifolium produced protein-like antibacterial metabolites. The antibacterial assay against Leuc. mesenteroides indicated that the fractions were stable at thermal processes and wide pH conditions, but sensitive to proteolyses. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study provides an increasing understanding of endophytic F. oxysporum in L. lancifolium and its metabolites, which have a great potential in food industry as antibacterial agents.","J","Liu, XL; Huang, KH; Zhou, JZ; Meng, L; Wang, Y; Zhang, LX",NA,"","","Liu, X.

"Taxol is a rare but extremely effective antitumor agent extracted from Taxus yew barks. Taxus plants are valuable and rare species, and the production of taxol from them is a complex process. Therefore, taxol-producing endophytic fungi seem to be a promising alternative because of their high practical value and convenient progress. In this study, the transcriptome of an endophytic fungus, Aspergillus aculeatinus Tax-6 was analyzed in order to understand the molecular mechanisms of producing fungal taxol. The results showed that genes involved in the mevalonate (MVA) pathway and non-mevalonate (MEP) pathway were expressed, including isopentenyl pyrophosphate transferase, geranyl pyrophosphate transferase, and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthetase. However, those downstream genes involved in the conversion of taxa-4(5)-11(12)-diene from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate were not expressed except for taxane 10-beta-hydroxylase. Additionally, a mutant strain, A. aculeatinus BT-2 was obtained from the original strain, A. aculeatinus Tax-6, using fungicidin as the mutagenic agent. The taxol yield of BT-2 was 560 mu g L-1, which was higher than that of Tax-6. To identify the mechanism of the difference in taxol production, we compared the transcriptomes of the two fungi and explored the changes in the gene expression between them. When compared with the original strain, Tax-6, most genes related to the MVA pathway in the mutant strain BT-2 showed upregulation, including GGPPS. Moreover, most of the downstream genes were not expressed in the mutant fungi as well. Overall, the results revealed the pathway and mechanism of taxol synthesis in endophytic fungi and the potential for the construction of taxol-producing genetic engineering strains.","J","Qiao, WC; Tang, TH; Ling, F",NA,"","","Qiao, Weichuan; Tang, Tianhao; Ling, Fei",NA,NA,"Comparative transcriptome analysis of a taxol-producing endophytic fungus, Aspergillus aculeatinus Tax-6, and its mutant strain","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2045-2322","","",NA,NA,"JUN 29",2020,10,"1",NA,"","",NA,"","","10558","10.1038/s41598-020-67614-1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-67614-1","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32601443,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000548359400031","View Full Record in Web of Science",531,"Presence"

"Muscodor yucatanensis, an endophytic fungus, was isolated from the leaves of Bursera simaruba (Burseraceae) in a dry, semideciduous tropical forest in the Ecological Reserve El Eden, Quintana Roo, Mexico. We tested the mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by M. yucatanensis for allelochemical effects against other endophytic fungi, phytopathogenic fungi and fungoids, and plants. VOCs were lethal to Guignardia mangifera, Colletotrichum sp., Phomopsis sp., Alternaria solani, Rhizoctonia sp., Phytophthora capsici, and P. parasitica, but had no effect on Fusarium oxysporum, Xylaria sp., the endophytic isolate 120, or M. yucatanensis. VOCs inhibited root elongation in amaranth, tomato, and barnyard grass, particularly those produced during the first 15 days of fungal growth. VOCs were identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and included compounds not previously reported from other Muscodor species and the previously reported compounds octane, 2-methyl butyl acetate, 2-pentyl furan, caryophyllene, and aromadendrene. We also evaluated organic extracts from the culture medium and mycelium of M. yucatanensis on the same endophytes, phytopathogens, and plants. In general, extracts inhibited plants more than endophytic or phytopathogens fungi. G. mangifera was the only organism that was significantly stimulated by both extracts regardless of concentration.

"Golden buckwheat (Fagopyrum dibotrys, also known as F. acutatum) is a traditional edible herbal medicinal plant with a large number of secondary metabolites and is considered to be a source of therapeutic compounds. Different ecological environments have a significant impact on their compound content and medicinal effects. However, little is known about the interactions between soil physicochemical properties, the rhizosphere, endophytic fungal communities, and secondary metabolites in F. dibotrys. In this study, the rhizosphere soil and endophytic fungal communities of F. dibotrys in five different ecological regions in China were identified based on high-throughput sequencing methods. The correlations between soil physicochemical properties, active components (total saponins, total flavonoids, proanthocyanidin, and epicatechin), and endophytic and rhizosphere soil fungi of F. dibotrys were analyzed. The results showed that soil pH, soil N, OM, and P were significantly correlated with the active components of F. dibotrys. Among them, epicatechin, proanthocyanidin, and total saponins were significantly positively correlated with soil pH, while proanthocyanidin content was significantly positively correlated with STN, SAN, and OM in soil, and total flavone content was significantly positively correlated with P in soil.

"Vetiver grass is a member of the grass family Poaceae. Its fast development is probably due to the interaction with native microbiota, whose influence has not been studied yet. The objective of this work was to evaluate the colonization and development of the vetiver grass (Chrysopogon zizanioides (L.) Roberty) inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophytic fungi. The experimental design was a completely randomized design with six treatments (control, without mycorrhizal fungi, native inoculants, UFLA05 - Gigaspora albida, UFLA351 - Rhizoglomus clarum, UFLA372 - Claroideoglomus etunicatum, and UFLA401 - Acaulospora morrowiae), with three replicates each. Vetiver grass tillers as well as the native microbial inoculum were obtained from the Lower Sao Francisco river experimental area, located in Sergipe state, Northeastern Brazil. There was a negative interaction between all tested UFLAs mycorrhizal isolates and the native microbiota (mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi) in the treatments, especially when taking into consideration plant height and volume of roots. The effects of inoculation with UFLA isolates may have been influenced by the presence of the native mycorrhizal fungi and the dark septate endophytic fungi. Vetiver grass was responsive to the native inoculant. The mycorrhizal colonization of the vetiver grass was vesicular, but the formation of the arbuscules can be influenced by the interaction between the fungus, plant, and the environment.","J","Santos, JS; Santos, JFS; Lopes, LJD; Mendonça, JD; Holanda, FSR; Marino, RH",NA,"","","Santos, Jessica Silva; Souza Santos, Jacilene Francisca; de Oliveira Lopes, Lazara Jossikarla; Mendonca, Johny de Jesus; Rodrigues Holanda, Francisco Sandro; Marino, Regina Helena",NA,NA,"ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI AND DARK SEPTATE ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI ON THE BIOMASS DEVELOPMENT OF VETIVER GRASS","REVISTA CAATINGA","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mendonça, Johny/HKV-5609-2023","Mendonça, Johny/0000-0002-7690-6234; Francisca, Jacilene/0000-0001-5109-3663; Holanda, Francisco/0000-0001-6812-6679; Lopes, Lazara/0000-0002-2413-0016; Silva Santos, Jessica/0000-0001-8789-0146",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0100-316X","1983-2125","",NA,NA,"JUL-SEP",2018,31,"3",NA,"","",NA,"602","611","","10.1590/1983-21252018v31n308rc","http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1983-21252018v31n308rc","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000433357100008","View Full Record in Web of Science",539,"Presence"
"The distribution and diversity of endophytic fungi in native hydrophytes from Korea were investigated. Fourteen hydrophytes (i.e., Hydrocharis dubia, Iris pseudacorus, Miscanthus sacchariflorus, Miscanthus sinensis, Nymphoides peltata, Nymphaea tetragona, Nelumbo nucifera, Pistia stratiotes, Salvinia natans, Sagittaria trifolia, Trapa japonica, Typha orientalis, Vallisneria natan, and Zizania latifolia) were sampled from freshwater marshes. A total of 216 fungal endophytes, isolated purely on the basis of morphological differences, were identified by ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA sequence similarity. The hydrophytes harbored a variety of endophytic fungi, most of which belonged to three phyla, seven classes, and 43 genera. Dramatic differences in diversity values were found among the six marshes, even within the same hydrophyte species. This distinguishing diversity or distribution of endophytes correlated with the specific environmental features but not the plant taxon. Several endophyte genera that have been reported to have biological activity (PGPR, ISR) were identified.

"Lawsone (2-hydroxy-1, 4-napthoquinone), also known as hennotannic acid, is an orange red dye used as a popular skin and hair colorant. The dye is produced in the leaves of Lawsonia inermis L, often referred to as the henna tree. In this study, we report the production of lawsone by an endophytic fungus, Gibberella moniliformis isolated from the leaf tissues of Lawsonia inermis. The fungus produced the orange-red dye in potato dextrose agar and broth, independent of the host tissue. Presence of lawsone was confirmed spectrometrically using HPLC and ESI-MS/MS analysis. The fragmentation pattern of lawsone was identical to both standard lawsone and that extracted from plant tissue. This is a first report of lawsone being produced by an endophytic fungus, independent of the host tissue. The study opens up interesting questions on the possible biosynthetic pathway through which lawsone is produced by the fungus.","J","Sarang, H; Rajani, P; Vasanthakumari, MM; Kumara, PM; Siva, R; Ravikanth, G; Shaanker, RU",NA,"","","Sarang, Hatnagar; Rajani, Pijakala; Vasanthakumari, Madhugiri Mallaiah; Kumara, Patel Mohana; Siva, Ramamoorthy; Ravikanth, Gudasalamani; Shaanker, R.

"Endophytic fungi play an important role in plant survival and reproduction, but the role of their metabolites in plant growth and immunity, as well as in crop quality formation, is poorly understood. Zhinengcong (ZNC) is a crude ethanol extract from the endophytic fungus Paecilomyces variotii, and previous studies have shown that it can improve the growth and immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana. The aim of the study was to reveal the trade-off balance between plant growth and immunity by evaluating the mechanisms of ZNC on potato growth, yield, and priming immunity against the oomycete Phytophthora infestans indoors and in the field. ZNC maintained a good balance between plant growth and resistance against P. infestans with high activity. It induced the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, promoted plant growth, yield and quality parameters, enhanced the expression of indoleacetic acid (IAA) related genes, and increased the absorption of nitrogen from the soil. Moreover, the plant endophytic fungus extract ZNC stimulated the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity (PTI) pathway and contributed to the ZNC-mediated defense response. Two years of field trials have shown that irrigation with ZNC at one of two optimal concentrations of 1 or 10ng/ml could significantly increase the output by 18.83% or more. The quality of potato tubers was also greatly improved, in which the contents of vitamin C, protein, and starch were significantly increased, especially the sugar content was increased by 125%. Spray application of ZNC onto potato plants significantly reduced the occurrence of potato blight disease with 66.49% of control efficacy at 200ng/ml and increased the potato yield by 66.68% or more in the field. In summary, plant endophytic fungus extract ZNC promoted potato immunity, yield, and quality and presented excellent potential in agricultural applications.","J","Cao, J; Liu, BY; Xu, XN; Zhang, XY; Zhu, CX; Li, Y; Ding, XH",NA,"","","Cao, Juan; Liu, Baoyou; Xu, Xinning; Zhang, Xiaoying; Zhu, Changxiang; Li, Yang; Ding, Xinhua",NA,NA,"Plant Endophytic Fungus Extract ZNC Improved Potato Immunity, Yield, and Quality","FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ding, xinhua/AAV-2612-2020; zhang, wb/JGM-5316-2023; Yan, Jing/JFA-6705-2023","ding, xinhua/0000-0002-6510-5992;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-462X","","",NA,NA,"SEP 16",2021,12,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","707256","10.3389/fpls.2021.707256","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.707256","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34621283,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000704194100001","View Full Record in Web of Science",542,"Presence"
"Background: Endophytic fungi are receiving attention as sources of structurally novel bioactive secondary metabolites towards drug discovery from natural products. This study reports the isolation and characterization of secondary metabolites from an endophytic fungus Aspergillus nidulans, associated with Nyctanthes arbor-tristis Linn., a plant which has a traditional use to cure many ailments including cancer. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of the metabolites of A. nidulans from N. arbor-iristis on three human cancer cell lines, lung (NCI-H460), breast (MCF-7) and uterine cervix (HeLa), and carry out their characterization. Methods: The extracts of the endophytic fungus cultured on potato dextrose agar were subjected to various chromatographic techniques. Structures of pure compounds were determined using spectroscopic techniques. The non-polar constituents were analyzed by GC-MS. Antiproliferative activity was determined by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Results: The extracts and fractions showed moderate to good growth inhibition of the aforementioned human cancer cell lines. The broth extract was most potent (IC50 = 10 +/- 3.1 mu g/mL and LC50 = 95 +/- 3.9) against HeLa whereas petroleum ether insoluble fraction of mycelium was most active against NCI-H460 and MCF-7 (IC50 = 10 +/- 2.1 mu g/mL and 18 +/- 3.1 mu g/mL respectively). GC-MS led to identify 12 compounds in mycelium and 19 compounds in broth. Four pure compounds were isolated and characterized one compound 5, 10-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylic acid (1) from broth and three 1-hydroxy-3-methylxanthone (2), ergosterol (3) and sterigmatocystin (4) from mycelium. 1 has not been reported earlier as a plant/fungal metabolite while 2-4 are new from this source. Sterigmatocystin exhibited growth inhibitory effect (IC50 = 50 +/- 2.5 mu M/mL) against only MCF-7 cell line whereas other compounds had IC50 > 100. Conclusions: In this paper, the cytotoxicity of mycelium and broth constituents of endophytic fungus Aspergillus nidulans from Nyctanthes arbor-tristis is reported for the first time. The study shows that fungus Aspergillus nidulans from Nyctanthes arbor-trisils is capable of producing biologically active natural compounds and provides a scientific rationale for further chemical investigations of endophyte-producing natural products.","J","Sana, T; Siddiqui, BS; Shahzad, S; Farooq, AD; Siddiqui, F; Sattar, S; Begum, S",NA,"","","Sana, Talea; Siddiqui, Bina S.; Shahzad, Saleem; Farooq, Ahsana D.; Siddiqui, Faheema; Sattar, Samia; Begum, Sabira",NA,NA,"Antiproliferative Activity and Characterization of Metabolites of Aspergillus nidulans: An Endophytic Fungus from Nyctanthes arbor-tristis Linn.

"Endophytic fungi strains (n = 81) were isolated from the leaves, barks, and fruits of Camellia oleifera from Hunan province (China) to delineate their species composition and potential as biological control agents of C. oleifera anthracnose. The fungi were identified by morphological and phylogenetic analyses. Fungal colonization rates of the leaves, barks, and fruits were 58.02, 27.16, and 14.81%, respectively. The isolates were identified as 14 genera, belonging to two subdivisions, Deuteromycotina and Ascomycotina; 87.65% of all isolates belonged to Deuteromycotina. The dominant species, occurring with a high relative frequency, were Pestalotiopsis sp. (14.81%), Penicillium sp. (14.81%), and Fusarium sp. (12.35%). The Simpson's and Shannon's diversity indices revealed the highest species diversity in the leaves, followed by the barks and fruits. The similarity index for the leaves versus barks comparison was the highest, indicating that the number of endophytic fungal species shared by the leaves and barks was higher than barks and fruits or leaves and fruits. Based on the results of dual culture experiments, only five strains exhibited antifungal activity against C. oleifera anthracnose pathogen, with isolate ty-64 (Oidium sp.) generating the broadest inhibition zones.

"BackgroundRhizosphere soil physicochemical, endophytic fungi have an important role in plant growth. A large number of endophytic fungi play an indispensable role in promoting plant growth and development, and they can provide protection for host plants by producing a variety of secondary metabolites to resist and inhibit plant pathogens. Due to the terrain of Gansu province is north-south and longitudinal, different climatic conditions, altitude, terrain and growth environment will affect the growth of Codonopsis pilosula, and the changes in these environmental factors directly affect the quality and yield of C. pilosula in different production areas. However, In C. pilosula, the connection between soil nutrients, spatiotemporal variation and the community structure of endophytic fungi isolated from C. pilosula roots has not been well studied.ResultsSeven hundred six strains of endophytic fungi were obtained using tissue isolation and the hyphaend-purification method from C. pilosula roots that picked at all seasons and six districts (Huichuan, HC; Longxi, LX; Zhangxian, ZX; Minxian, MX; Weiyuan, WY; and Lintao, LT) in Gansu Province, China. Fusarium sp. (205 strains, 29.04%), Aspergillus sp. (196 strains, 27.76%), Alternaria sp. (73 strains, 10.34%), Penicillium sp. (58 strains, 8.22%) and Plectosphaerella sp. (56 strains, 7.93%) were the dominant genus. The species composition differed from temporal and spatial distribution (Autumn and Winter were higher than Spring and Summer, MX and LT had the highest similarity, HC and LT had the lowest). physical and chemical of soil like Electroconductibility (EC), Total nitrogen (TN), Catalase (CAT), Urease (URE) and Sucrase (SUC) had significant effects on agronomic traits of C. pilosula (P < 0.05). AK (Spring and Summer), TN (Autumn) and altitude (Winter) are the main driving factors for the change of endophytic fungal community. Moreover, geographic location (such as altitude, latitude and longitude) also has effects on the diversity of endophytic fungi.ConclusionsThese results suggested that soil nutrients and enzyme, seasonal variation and geographical locations have an impact on shaping the community structure of culturable endophytic fungi in the roots of C. pilosula and its root traits. This suggests that climatic conditions may play a driving role in the growth and development of C. pilosula.","J","Fan, LL; Li, YL; Wang, XL; Leng, FF; Li, SW; Zhu, N; Chen, K; Wang, YG",NA,"","","Fan, Lili; Li, Yuanli; Wang, Xiaoli; Leng, Feifan; Li, Shaowei; Zhu, Ning; Chen, Kai; Wang, Yonggang",NA,NA,"Culturable endophytic fungi community structure isolated from Codonopsis pilosula roots and effect of season and geographic location on their structures","BMC MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yang, Fan/JMA-9594-2023; zhang, xinyu/JKI-8403-2023; li, yifan/JHU-9272-2023; zhang, xiao/JCN-8822-2023; Li, Yao/JJC-2927-2023; yang, rui/JHI-3328-2023; Liu, Jie/JCP-1070-2023; Zhang, Yunyi/JHS-3626-2023; yang, xiao/JLL-7721-2023; Zhang, Wei/JKI-3565-2023; Li, Wei/JLL-4365-2023; sun, chen/JCP-0396-2023; Zhang, Yun/JCN-7026-2023; WANG, YING/JLM-9219-2023; yuanyuan, Li/JEZ-6497-2023; YI, J/JJE-7713-2023; liu, yang/JMB-9083-2023; liu, xiao/JLL-2119-2023; Zhou, Yue/JHS-8791-2023; zheng, yan/JKJ-3632-2023; wang, xiaoqiang/JMT-2783-2023; zhao, lin/JJF-0406-2023; Yang, Ying/JLL-3724-2023; wang, xiaoxuan/JMP-6531-2023","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1471-2180","","",NA,NA,"MAY 15",2023,23,"1",NA,"","",NA,"","","132","10.1186/s12866-023-02848-3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12866-023-02848-3","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37189022,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000987150800001","View Full Record in Web of Science",545,"Presence"
"Drought is one of the major constraints in rice production in the rainfed areas. Water shortages due to long drought are the main problem causing the decline in rice productivity. One effort that can be done to overcome the drought is the use of endophytic fungi. This study aimed to determine the effect of the application of local aromatic rice endophytic fungi on growth and production of rice in limited water conditions. This study was arranged in a Randomized Block Design with four treatments of field inundation combined with the fungi. Treatment were consisted of four levels: inundation with water level of 5 cm, inundation with water level of 1 cm, inundation with water level of 5 cm + endophytic fungi, and inundation with water level of 1 cm + endophytic fungi. Rice seedlings were planted using Legowo 4 : 1 with the distance within rows of 25 cm x 25 cm and the distance between rows of 50 cm. The results show that the application of endophytic fungi produced plant height, tiller number, root length, root weight, number of filled grains and production per hectare were higher and significantly different from the treatment without application of endophytic fungi.

"Endophytic fungi have been used to obtain novel bioactive secondary metabolites with potential applications in medical and agricultural sectors, which can also act as lead targets for pharmaceutical and medicinal potential. In the present study, the endophytic fungus Paecilomyces formosus LHL10 isolated from the root of cucumber plant was tested for its enzyme inhibitory potential. The ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract of LHL10 was screened for its inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase (AChE), alpha-glucosidase, urease, and anti-lipid peroxidation. The findings suggest that the EtOAc extract from LHL10 possesses significant inhibitory potential against urease and alpha-glucosidase. The EtOAc extract was thus, subjected to advanced column chromatographic techniques for the isolation of pure compounds. The structure elucidation was carried out through spectroscopic analysis and comparison with literature data, and these compounds were confirmed as known a sester-terpenoid (1) and a known cyclic peptide (2). The enzyme inhibition bioassay indicated that Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited remarkable inhibitory rate against alpha-glucosidase and urease, with an IC50 value of 61.80 +/- 5.7, 75.68 +/- 6.2 and 74.25 +/- 4.3, 190.5 +/- 10.31 mu g/g, respectively.

"Breeding on mountains, cultivation in dam areas is a unique propagation method for the vegetatively propagated plant Ligusticum chuanxiong, including two transplants between the mountain and the dam area. It is well known that the environment can influence the endophytic community structure of plants. However, the change of host endophytic flora caused by transplanting in different places and its influence on asexual reproduction are still poorly understood. We carried out three cycles of cultivation experiments on L. chuanxiong and collected stem nodes (LZ), immature rhizomes (PX), medicinal rhizomes (CX), and rhizosphere. High-throughput sequencing was performed to analyze the endophytic fungi in all samples. We observed that the diversity and richness of endophytic fungi in L. chuanxiong increased as a result of transplanting cultivation from dam areas to mountains. Local transplantation caused minor changes in the endophytic fungus structure of L. chuanxiong, while remote transplantation caused significant changes. Compared with LZ after breeding in the dam area, the LZ after breeding on mountains has more abundant Gibberella, Phoma, Pericona, Paraphoma, and Neocosmospora. The regular pattern of the relative abundance of endophytic fungi is consistent with that of the fungus in the soil, while there are also some cases that the relative abundance of endophytic fungi is the opposite of that of soil fungi. In addition, there is a significant correlation among certain kinds of endophytic fungi whether in the soil or the plants. We have isolated more gibberellin-producing and auxin-producing fungi in the LZ cultivated in the mountains than that in the LZ cultivated in the dam area. The results of pot experiments showed that the three fungi isolated from LZ cultivated in mountainous areas can promote the development of shoots, stem nodes, and internodes of LZ, and increase the activity of plant peroxidase, catalase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, and other enzymes. We can conclude that transplantation leads to the recombination of the host endophytic fungus, the more significant the difference in the environment is, the greater the reorganization caused by transplanting. Reorganization is determined by the soil environment, hosts, and the interaction of microorganisms. Remote transplantation is a crucial opportunity to reshuffle the micro-ecological structure of the asexual reproduction of plants, and regulate the growth, development, and resistance of plants, and prevent germplasm degradation caused by asexual reproduction.","J","Kang, L; He, DM; Wang, H; Han, GQ; Lv, HY; Xiao, WT; Zhang, ZL; Yan, ZY; Huang, LQ",NA,"","","Kang, Lei; He, Dongmei; Wang, Hai; Han, Guiqi; Lv, Hongyang; Xiao, Wanting; Zhang, Zhanling; Yan, Zhuyun; Huang, Luqi",NA,NA,"Breeding on Mountains Resulted in the Reorganization of Endophytic Fungi in Asexually Propagated Plants (Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort.)","FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-462X","","",NA,NA,"NOV 10",2021,12,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","740456","10.3389/fpls.2021.740456","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.740456","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34858448,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000726035800001","View Full Record in Web of Science",548,"Presence"
"Fungal endophytes have been isolated from almost every plant, infecting their hosts without causing visible disease symptoms, and yet have still proved to be involved in plant secondary metabolites accumulation. To decipher the possible physiological mechanisms of the endophytic fungus-host interaction, the role of protein phosphorylation and the relationship between endophytic fungus-induced kinase activity and nitric oxide (NO) and brassinolide (BL) in endophyte-enhanced volatile oil accumulation in Atractylodes lancea plantlets were investigated using pharmacological and biochemical approaches. Inoculation with the endophytic fungus Gilmaniella sp. AL12 enhanced the activities of total protein phosphorylation, Ca2+-dependent protein kinase, and volatile oil accumulation in A. lancea plantlets. The upregulation of protein kinase activity could be blocked by the BL inhibitor brassinazole. Furthermore, pretreatments with the NO-specific scavenger cPTIO significantly reduced the increased activities of protein kinases in A. lancea plantlets inoculated with endophytic fungus. Pretreatments with different protein kinase inhibitors also reduced fungus-induced NO production and volatile oil accumulation, but had barely no effect on the BL level. These data suggest that protein phosphorylation is required for endophyte-induced volatile oil production in A. lancea plantlets, and that crosstalk between protein phosphorylation and the NO pathway may occur and act as a downstream signaling event of the BL pathway.","J","Ren, CG; Dai, CC",NA,"","","Ren, Cheng-Gang; Dai, Chuan-Chao",NA,NA,"Nitric Oxide and Brassinosteroids Mediated Fungal Endophyte-Induced Volatile Oil Production Through Protein Phosphorylation Pathways in Atractylodes lancea Plantlets","JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE PLANT BIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1672-9072","1744-7909","",NA,NA,"NOV",2013,55,"11",NA,"","",NA,"1136","1146","","10.1111/jipb.12087","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jipb.12087","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,23773784,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000328148600012","View Full Record in Web of Science",549,"Presence"

The results clearly revealed that co-culture of C. avellana cells and E. nigrum was more effective than elicitation of C. avellana cells by only cell extract or culture filtrate of this fungal strain. Co-culture of C. avellana cells and E. nigrum surpassed monocultures in terms of paclitaxel production designating their synergistic interaction potential. Fungal inoculum amount, co-culture establishment time and co-culture period were important factors for achieving the maximum production of paclitaxel in this co-culture system. The highest total yield of paclitaxel (404.5 mu gL(-1)) was produced in co-culture established on 13th day using 3.2% (v/v) of E. nigrum mycelium suspension, which was about 5.5 and 136.6 times that in control cultures of C. avellana cells and E. nigrum, respectively. This is the first report on positive effect of co-culture of paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungus and non-host plant cells for enhancing paclitaxel production.

"Schinus terebinthifoliusRaddi is a medicinal plant widely used for the treatment of various diseases. The secondary metabolites responsible for the pharmacological properties can be produced directly by the plant or by endophytic fungi. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diversity of endophytic fungi of different parts ofS. terebinthifoliusand to identify chemical compounds produced by endophytes and their antioxidant and antibacterial activities. For this, fruits, stem bark and roots were dried, ground and placed in fungal growth medium. The selected endophytes were grown and subjected to extraction with ethyl acetate. DPPH, FRAP, beta-carotene bleaching and antimicrobial assays were performed. The phylogenetic tree was elaborated, encompassing 15 different species. The fungal extracts showed hydroxybenzoic acids and 1-dodecanol as predominant compounds. All fungal extracts exhibited antioxidant activity. The fungal extracts exhibited bactericidal and bacteriostatic activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial ATCC strains and against methicillin-resistant nosocomial bacteria. Among the 10 endophytic fungi evaluated, the extract of the fungusOchrocladosporium elatumshowed higher phenolic content and exhibited higher antioxidant and antibacterial activities in all tests. Together, the results increase the known diversity ofS. terebinthifoliusendophytic fungi, secondary metabolites produced and their antioxidant and antibacterial activities.","J","Rocha, PD; Paula, VMB; Olinto, SCF; dos Santos, EL; Souza, KD; Estevinho, LM",NA,"","","Rocha, Paola dos Santos; Branco Paula, Vanessa Marina; Figueira Olinto, Silvia Cristina; dos Santos, Edson Lucas; Souza, Kely de Picoli; Estevinho, Leticia Miranda",NA,NA,"Diversity, Chemical Constituents and Biological Activities of Endophytic Fungi Isolated fromSchinus terebinthifoliusRaddi","MICROORGANISMS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"dos Santos, Edson Lucas/AAU-5857-2020; de Picoli Souza, Kely/I-1248-2015; de Picoli Souza, Kely/AAU-5978-2020; Rocha, Paola dos Santos da/GWV-6262-2022","dos Santos, Edson Lucas/0000-0002-6557-7914; de Picoli Souza, Kely/0000-0001-5764-2125; de Picoli Souza, Kely/0000-0001-5764-2125; Rocha, Paola dos Santos da/0000-0003-1019-1202; B.

"Endophytes are microbes that live inside the tissues of plants without causing any disease. Many of these belonging to fungi have been exploited earlier for their biological activities. This study focused on the exploration and characterization of culturable endophytic fungi inhabiting the medicinal plant Dillenia indical. during four different seasons (summer, monsoon, autumn, and winter) from 2018 to 2019. A total of 2360 segments from different parts (leaves, fruits, and stem) were screened to isolate endophytic fungi. During the study, 25 species of fungi belonging to 20 genera were isolated from the selected plant. The identification of these fungi was validated at morphological, microscopic, and molecular levels. Results indicate the plant has the highest affinity for Daldinia eschscholtzii, followed by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Cladosporium cladosporioides. Further, the percent frequency was highest in leaves, followed by stem and fruits. The results were further supported by a similar trend of colonization rate for different plant parts. The monsoon season had the highest number of isolates (312), followed by summer (208), winter (164), and autumn (114). Species diversity was highest during the monsoon season and lowest during the winter. These fungi also produce amylase, lipase, protease, asparaginase, cellulase, and ligninolytic enzymes. This study focused only on culturable fungal endophytes, yet the scope can be extended for other non-culturable microbes and their interaction by using high-throughput genomics and novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) tools. The results indicate that Dillenia indical. harbors novel endophytic fungi having industrial applications.","J","Kumar, V; Prasher, IB",NA,"","","Kumar, Vijay; Prasher, I.

"Plant endophytic fungi are reservoirs of novel bioactive natural products, which may be used directly or indirectly to treat numerous diseases. However, it is difficult to rapidly obtain the natural products of interest from enormous endogenic fungi by conventional chemical extraction and separation methods when the overall biosynthetic potential is unknown. There is a lack of systematic studies on the biosynthetic and metabolic potential of endophytic fungi of Salvia miltiorrhiza. Therefore, untargeted metabolomics and metagenomic binning technology were used in this study to analyze the biosynthetic potential of endophytic fungi isolated from S. miltiorrhiza, including 47 species and 166 strains of 24 genera. Metabolomics analysis showed that 3016 metabolites were annotated, involving multiple primary and secondary metabolic pathways.

"Endophytes are fungi and bacteria that inhabit plant tissues without causing disease. Endophytes have characteristics that are important for the health of the plant and have been isolated from several plants of economic and medicinal interest but rarely from ornamental plants. The current study isolates and identifies endophytic fungi from the leaves of Pachystachys lutea and evaluates the antagonistic activity of these endophytes as well as cellulase production by the endophytes. Fungi were isolated by fragmentation from surface-disinfected leaves and were identified by the sequencing of the ITS gene and the genes coding for EF 1-alpha and beta-tubulin followed by multilocus sequence analysis. Molecular taxonomic analysis revealed that 78% of the identified fungi belonged to the genus Diaporthe. We also identified strains belonging to the genera Colletotrichum, Phyllosticta, Xylaria, Nemania, and Alternaria. Most of the strains tested were able to inhibit the growth of pathogenic fungi, especially PL09 (Diaporthe sp.), which inhibited the growth of Colletotrichum sp., and PL03 (Diaporthe sp.), which inhibited the growth of Fusarium oxysporum. The production of cellulase ranged from 0.87 to 1.60 mu mol/min. Foliar endophytic fungal isolates from P. lutea showed promising results for the in vitro control of plant pathogens and for cellulase production.

"This work describes the distribution and diversity of fungal endophytes associated with leaves of Colobanthus quitensis, a dicotyledonous plant that lives in Antarctica. A total of 188 fungal isolates were obtained from six different sites located across a 25.5-km transect through Admiralty Bay, at King George Island. The ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 nuclear ribosomal gene was sequenced and the endophytic fungi were identified as species belonging to the genera Aspergillus, Cadophora, Davidiella, Entrophospora, Fusarium, Geomyces, Gyoerffyella, Microdochium, Mycocentrospora, and Phaeosphaeria. Davidiella tassiana was the prevalent species with 20.2% abundance. The endophytic fungal community showed low richness and high dominance indexes. Eleven endophytic taxa (58%) were fungi able to produce melanin in their hyphae, which may confer resistance against freezing temperatures and high rates of UV radiation and may increase their fitness in the extreme conditions of the Antarctic environment. In addition, phytopathogenic and decomposer species associated with healthy leaves of C. quitensis were found. The results obtained in this work show that C. quitensis is an interesting reservoir of saprobic and pathogenic fungal species, and could be a community model for further ecological and evolutionary studies, as well as studies of the adaptation mechanisms these microorganisms have to the extreme conditions in Antarctica.","J","Rosa, LH; Vieira, MDA; Santiago, IF; Rosa, CA",NA,"","","Rosa, Luiz Henrique; Almeida Vieira, Mariana de Lourdes; Santiago, Iara Furtado; Rosa, Carlos Augusto",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi community associated with the dicotyledonous plant Colobanthus quitensis (Kunth) Bartl.

"Purpose: To study the effect of palmarumycin C-13, an elicitor from the endophytic fungus Berkleasmium sp. Dzf12, on growth and diosgenin production in plantlet or cell cultures of its host plant, Dioscorea zingiberensis. Methods: Palmarumycin C-13 was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of the endophytic fungus Berkleasmium sp. Dzf12 using a combination of high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC), Sephadex LH-20 chromatography and preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The biomass of the plantlet and cell cultures of D. zingiberensis as well as their diosgenin content and yield were analyzed after treatment with palmarumycin C-13. Results: Optimal elicitation of diosgenin production by palmarumycin C-13 in D. zingiberensis plantlet and cell cultures was achieved when palmarumycin C-13 was added to the medium at a concentration of 60 mg/L (for plantlet culture) at the beginning of culturing or 10 mg/L (for cell culture) on day 25 after inoculation. By using these optimal concentrations, the diosgenin yield of the cultured plantlets reached its maximum of 6.44 mg/L, that is, > 1.4-fold increase, while diosgenin yield of the cultured cells reached a maximum of 10.73 mg/L, which is an > 8.0-fold increase.

"Despite the continuing interest in various plant and natural products, only a small portion of the biologically active compounds from nature has been discovered and exploited. In this study, antioxidant and antibacterial properties of aqueous fractions of three endophytic fungi isolated from the roots of 8-year-old Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris) growing on a drained peatland were investigated. The endophytic fungi species were Acephala applanata, Phialocephala fortinii, and Humicolopsis cephalosporioides/Coniochaeta mutabilis. The bioactivities were examined using hydrogen peroxide scavenging and oxygen radical absorbance capacity tests as well as sensitive Escherichia coli-based biosensors, which produce a luminescent signal in the presence of substances with oxidative or genotoxic properties. In addition, cell models for Parkinson's disease, age-related macular degeneration, and osteoarthritis were used to evaluate the potential for pharmaceutical applications. The aqueous extracts of fungi and 19 out of 42 fractions were found to be active in one or more of the tests used. However, no activity was found in the age-related macular degeneration and osteoarthritis cell model tests. Additionally, bioactivity data was connected with metabolites putatively annotated, and out of 330 metabolites, 177 were interesting in view of the bioactivities investigated. A majority of these were peptides and all three fungal species shared a highly similar metabolome. We propose that Scots pine endophytic fungi are a rich source of interesting metabolites, and synergistic effects may cause the bioactivities, as they were found to vary after the fractionation process.","J","Tienaho, J; Karonen, M; Muilu-Mäkelä, R; Kaseva, J; de Pedro, N; Vicente, F; Genilloud, O; Aapola, U; Uusitalo, H; Vuolteenaho, K; Franzén, R; Wähälä, K; Karp, M; Santala, V; Sarjala, T",NA,"","","Tienaho, Jenni; Karonen, Maarit; Muilu-Makela, Riina; Kaseva, Janne; de Pedro, Nuria; Vicente, Francisca; Genilloud, Olga; Aapola, Ulla; Uusitalo, Hannu; Vuolteenaho, Katriina; Franzen, Robert; Wahala, Kristiina; Karp, Matti; Santala, Ville; Sarjala, Tytti",NA,NA,"Bioactive Properties of the Aqueous Extracts of Endophytic Fungi Associated with Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) Roots","PLANTA MEDICA","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Franzen, Robert G/G-4226-2014; Kaseva, Janne/GLT-5462-2022","Kaseva, Janne/0000-0002-8167-5434; Franzen, Robert/0000-0002-4845-2976; Tienaho, Jenni/0000-0002-7089-7832; Aapola, Ulla/0000-0001-7691-3170; Muilu-Makela, Riina/0000-0003-4879-5482; Vuolteenaho, Katriina/0000-0003-0017-1291; Santala, Ville/0000-0002-9084-931X; Wahala, Kristiina/0000-0003-4082-8622",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0032-0943","1439-0221","",NA,NA,"SEP",2020,86,"13/14",NA,"","",NA,"1009","1024","","10.1055/a-1185-4437","http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1185-4437","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32521558,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000571792100011","View Full Record in Web of Science",562,"Presence"
"Interactions among the component members of different symbioses are not well studied. For example, leaf-cutting ants maintain an obligate symbiosis with their fungal garden, while the leaf material they provide to their garden is usually filled with endophytic fungi. The ants and their cultivar may interact with hundreds of endophytic fungal species, yet little is known about these interactions. Experimental manipulations showed that (i) ants spend more time cutting leaves from a tropical vine, Merremia umbellata, with high versus low endophyte densities, (ii) ants reduce the amount of endophytic fungi in leaves before planting them in their gardens, (iii) the ants' fungal cultivar inhibits the growth of most endophytes tested. Moreover, the inhibition by the ants' cultivar was relatively greater for more rapidly growing endophyte strains that could potentially out-compete or overtake the garden. Our results suggest that endophytes are not welcome in the garden, and that the ants and their cultivar combine ant hygiene behaviour with fungal inhibition to reduce endophyte activity in the nest.","J","Van Bael, SA; Fernández-Marín, H; Valencia, MC; Rojas, EI; Wcislo, WT; Herre, EA",NA,"","","Van Bael, Sunshine A.; Fernandez-Marin, Hermogenes; Valencia, Mariana C.; Rojas, Enith I.; Wcislo, William T.; Herre, Edward A.",NA,NA,"Two fungal symbioses collide: endophytic fungi are not welcome in leaf-cutting ant gardens","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Van Bael, Sunshine/K-1930-2019; Van Bael, Sunshine/M-5370-2019","Van Bael, Sunshine/0000-0001-7317-3533",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0962-8452","1471-2954","",NA,NA,"JUL 7",2009,276,"1666",NA,"","",NA,"2419","2426","","10.1098/rspb.2009.0196","http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2009.0196","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19364739,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000266990700012","View Full Record in Web of Science",563,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi of three tissues (petiole, bark and leaf) of Alstonia scholaris were assessed. A total number of 1,152 endophytic fungi were isolated from 1,002 different plant segments of seven different localities of Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, India. The isolated fungi belong to nineteen genera, including four unidentified fungi and yeast. Colletotrichum sp. (20.39%) and Sordaria sp. (29.68%) were most commonly isolated from this plant. Hyalopus sp., Fusarium sp. and Curvularia sp. were also isolated. The colonization frequency of endophytic fungi is much higher in leaves (44.66%) in comparison to petioles (32.16%) and barks (23.17%). The study provided evidence for tissue specificity of endophytic fungi. The endophytic fungal species diversity was higher in plant segments collected from Gopegarh and Khoirullahchak, while diversity was the lowest in Rice mill area. Screenings of antimicrobial activity of these isolated endophytic fungi were done. Eight endophytic fungi showed antimicrobial activity.

"Dendrobium nobile, an epiphytic plant, is a traditional medicinal herb with abundant endophytes. It is unclear whether the variation in the diversity and abundance of endophytes could stimulate the biosynthesis of medicinal compounds in the plant. In this study, we collected fresh stems of D. nobile from four habitats for investigating the fungal community structure, dendrobine content, and environment factors and their correlations. The results indicated no significant difference in endophytic fungal diversity among the habitats; however, different dominant or special endophytic genera were observed in the hosts from different habitats. The altitude was observed to be positively related to the dendrobine content, as the stems collected from the altitude of 692 m exhibited the highest level of dendrobine. Furthermore, the relative abundance of Toxicocladosporium was found to be positively correlated with the altitude and dendrobine content. The epiphytic matrix exhibited a significant negative correlation with the relative abundance of the endophytic fungus Gibberella but did not exhibit any significant correlation with the dendrobine content. The results indicated that the abundance of endophytes in D. nobile was affected by the altitude and epiphytic matrix and that high Toxicocladosporium abundance and high altitude were conducive to dendrobine production.","J","Li, L; Liu, CB; Wen, WE; Li, QQ; Pan, TT; Li, ZG; Qian, G; He, YQ; Xu, DL",NA,"","","Li, Lin; Liu, Chaobo; Wen, Wei'e; Li, Qingqing; Pan, Tiantian; Li, Zhaogao; Qian, Gang; He, Yuqi; Xu, Delin",NA,NA,"Dendrobine biosynthesis in Dendrobium nobile in four different habitats is affected by the variations in the endophytic fungal community","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Xu, Delin/0000-0003-3695-2997",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1664-302X","",NA,NA,"SEP 13",2022,13,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","981070","10.3389/fmicb.2022.981070","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.981070","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36177465,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000866227000001","View Full Record in Web of Science",566,"Presence"
"Cananga odorata (Annonaceae), Terminalia catappa and Terminalia mantaly (Combretaceae) aremedicinal plants used in Cameroon to treat several diseases. In this study endophytic fungi associated with these plants were isolated and identified, and their enzymatic activities were determined. For this purpose, endophytes isolated from samples of leaves, stems, bark, roots, and flowers of each species were classified according to culture morphology and nucleotide sequences of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of ribosomal genes. With this technique, the isolates were classified into 21 genera of ascomycetes. The fungal collection was further characterized on the basis of amylase, cellulose, lipase, and laccase enzymatic activity. Isolates positive for all or some of these activities were detected. The results indicate that these medicinal plants contain a high diversity of endophytic fungi, and could be a repository of valuable bioactive chemicals. In addition, this study showed that these fungi could be useful for the production of enzymes of industrial importance. (C) 2016 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Doses of AA (0, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mM) were introduced in agar-water 0.5% medium and weed seeds treated with and without external sterilization by sodium hypochloride. Four replications of fifty seeds of each species by treatment were sown in plastic boxes with cover and maintained in germination chamber for 12 days. Reduction in germination rate, root and stem growth were observed in both species, as well as reduction in root number in morningglory were also observed at 2.0 mM concentration of AA. An increase in number of seeds with presence of endophytic fungi was also observed in both species, independently of seed sterilization, mainly of a green type fungi coloration in wild poinsettia.

"Endophytic fungi in symbiotic association with their host plant are well known to improve plant growth and reduce the adverse effects of both biotic and abiotic stresses. Therefore, fungal endophytes are beginning to receive increased attention in an effort to find growth-promoting strains that could be applied to enhance crop yield and quality. In our study, the plant growth-promoting activities of endophytic fungi isolated from various parts of Sophora flavescens (a medicinally important plant in Mongolia and China) have been revealed and investigated. Fungal isolates were identified using molecular taxonomical methods, while their plant growth-promoting abilities were evaluated in plate assays. Altogether, 15 strains were isolated, representing the genera Alternaria, Didymella, Fusarium and Xylogone. Five of the isolates possessed phosphate solubilization activities and twelve secreted siderophores, while all of them were able to produce indoleacetic acid (IAA) in the presence or absence of tryptophan. The endogenous and exogenous accumulation of IAA were also monitored in liquid cultures using the HPLC-MS/MS technique to refine the plate assay results. Furthermore, for the highest IAA producer fungi, the effects of their extracts were also examined in plant bioassays. In these tests, the primary root lengths of the model Arabidopsis thaliana were increased in several cases, while the biomasses were significantly lower than the control IAA treatment. Significant alterations have also been detected in the photosynthetic pigment (chlorophyll-a, -b and carotenoids) content due to the fungal extract treatments, but these changes did not show any specific trends.","J","Turbat, A; Rakk, D; Vigneshwari, A; Kocsubé, S; Thu, H; Szepesi, A; Bakacsy, L; Skrbic, BD; Jigjiddorj, EA; Vágvölgyi, C; Szekeres, A",NA,"","","Turbat, Adiyadolgor; Rakk, David; Vigneshwari, Aruna; Kocsube, Sandor; Huynh Thu; Szepesi, Agnes; Bakacsy, Laszlo; Skrbic, Biljana D.; Jigjiddorj, Enkh-Amgalan; Vagvolgyi, Csaba; Szekeres, Andras",NA,NA,"Characterization of the Plant Growth-Promoting Activities of Endophytic Fungi Isolated from Sophora flavescens","MICROORGANISMS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Szepesi, Agnes/AAK-8966-2020; Szepesi, Ágnes/L-8814-2018; Skrbic, Biljana/ABE-9412-2020; Szekeres, András/I-8956-2012; Bakacsy, László/AAW-3995-2021; Skrbic, Biljana/T-1660-2019","Szepesi, Agnes/0000-0003-3043-4857; Szepesi, Ágnes/0000-0003-3043-4857; Szekeres, András/0000-0003-1651-4623; Bakacsy, László/0000-0003-2593-1795; Skrbic, Biljana/0000-0002-8615-8989; Kocsube, Sandor/0000-0001-7839-0510; Turbat, Adiyadolgor/0000-0002-2072-9689; Vagvolgyi, Csaba/0000-0003-0009-7773; RAMASAMY, ARUNA VIGNESHWARI/0000-0002-8131-1518",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2076-2607","",NA,NA,"MAY",2020,8,"5",NA,"","",NA,"","","683","10.3390/microorganisms8050683","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8050683","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32392856,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000540222300064","View Full Record in Web of Science",573,"Presence"
"Dry environments have plants with special adaptations which enable them to live on nutrient-poor soils, in high temperatures, and with a scarcity of water. One of the most important features is the ability to establish symbiosis with different microorganisms. Studies on the diversity of endophytic fungi from dry environments are recent and scarce. The endophytic community (fungi and bacteria) of cacti has been studied in Australia, the United States, Brazil, and Mexico, revealing special features in their composition. Bioprospecting studies on these organisms are just as scarce as the ecological studies, but have shown promising results. In the United States and Brazil, endophytes isolated from cacti were selected for the production of enzymes, antimicrobials, and anticancer substances. The purpose of this chapter is to review the literature on this subject, highlight the benefits of endophytic fungi species for plants on dry environments (mainly the Cactaceae family), and to emphasize the usefulness of endophytes in biotechnological processes.","B","Bezerra, JDP; de Azevedo, JL; Souza-Motta, CM",NA,"DeAzevedo, JL; Quecine, MC","","Pereira Bezerra, Jadson Diogo; de Azevedo, Joao Lucio; Souza-Motta, Cristina Maria",NA,NA,"Why Study Endophytic Fungal Community Associated with Cacti Species?","DIVERSITY AND BENEFITS OF MICROORGANISMS FROM THE TROPICS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Souza-Motta, Cristina Maria/C-3503-2013; Bezerra, Jadson DP/A-5846-2019","Bezerra, Jadson DP/0000-0002-7782-8602; Souza-Motta, Cristina/0000-0002-0964-8271",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","978-3-319-55804-2; 978-3-319-55803-5",NA,NA,"",2017,NA,"",NA,"","",NA,"21","35","","10.1007/978-3-319-55804-2_2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-55804-2_2","10.1007/978-3-319-55804-2","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000431800000003","View Full Record in Web of Science",574,"Review"
"There are many species of Chinese traditional leguminosae family plants that are well known for their medicinal applications, such as Astragalus membranaceus, Catsia tora, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Sophora flavescens and Albacia acacia. Their unique bioactive composition and internal phenological environment contribute to the formation of specific and unique endophytic fungal communities, which are important resources for new compounds used in a variety of pharmacological activities. Nonetheless, they have not been systematically studied. In the last decade, nearly 64 genera and thousands of species of endophytic fungi have been discovered from leguminosae plants, as well as 138 secondary metabolites (with 34 new compounds) including flavonoid, alkaloids, phenol, anthraquinone, macrolide, terpenoid, phytohormone and many more. These were shown to have diverse applications and benefits, such as antibacterial, antitumor, antioxidative, immunoregulatory and neuroprotective properties. Here, we provide a summarized overview with the aim of raising awareness of endophytic fungi from medicinal leguminosae plants and providing a comprehensive review of the discoveries of new natural products that may be of medicinal and pharmaceutical importance. This review presents the diversity, secondary metabolites and biological activities of endophytic fungi of medicinal leguminosae plants.","J","Zhou, ZY; Liu, X; Cui, JL; Wang, JH; Wang, ML; Zhang, G",NA,"","","Zhou, Zhong-Ya; Liu, Xi; Cui, Jin-Long; Wang, Jun-Hong; Wang, Meng-Liang; Zhang, Gang",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi and their bioactive secondary metabolites in medicinal leguminosae plants: nearly untapped medical resources","FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wang, JunHong/HKE-0286-2023","Liu, Xi/0000-0003-0432-1744; Cui, Jin-Long/0000-0001-5050-3384",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0378-1097","1574-6968","",NA,NA,"JUL 28",2022,369,"1",NA,"","",NA,"","","fnac052","10.1093/femsle/fnac052","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fnac052","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35746878,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000834465200004","View Full Record in Web of Science",575,"Review"

"Background: Opuntia dillenii is an invasive plant well established in the harsh South-Eastern arid zone of Sri Lanka. Evidence suggests it is likely that the endophytic fungal populations of O. dillenii assist the host in overcoming biotic and abiotic stress by producing biologically active metabolites. With this in mind there is potential to discover novel natural products with useful biological activities from this hitherto poorly investigated source. Consequently, an investigation of the antimicrobial activities of the endophytes of O. dillenii, that occupies a unique ecological niche, may well provide useful leads in the discovery of new pharmaceuticals. Methods: Endophytic fungi were isolated from the surface sterilized cladodes and flowers of O. dillenii using several nutrient media and the antimicrobial activities were evaluated against three Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria and Candida albicans. The two most bioactive fungi were identified by colony morphology and DNA sequencing. The secondary metabolite of the endophyte Fusarium sp. exhibiting the best activity was isolated via bioassay guided chromatography. The chemical structure was elucidated from the ESIMS and NMR spectroscopic data obtained for the active metabolite. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the active compound were determined. Results: Eight endophytic fungi were isolated from O. dillenii and all except one showed antibacterial activities against at least one of the test bacteria. All extracts were inactive against C. albicans. The most bioactive fungus was identified as Fusarium sp. and the second most active as Aspergillus niger. The structure of the major antibacterial compound of the Fusarium sp. was shown to be the tetramic acid derivative, equisetin. The MIC's for equisetin were 8 mu g mL(-1) against Bacillus subtilis, 16 mu g mL(-1) against Staphylococcus aureus and Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Conclusions: O. dillenii, harbors several endophytic fungi capable of producing antimicrobial substances with selective antibacterial properties. By producing biologically active secondary metabolites, such as equisetin isolated from the endophytic Fusarium sp., the endophytic fungal population may be assisting the host to successfully withstand stressful environmental conditions. Further investigations on the secondary metabolites produced by these endophytes may provide additional drug leads.","J","Ratnaweera, PB; de Silva, ED; Williams, DE; Andersen, RJ",NA,"","","Ratnaweera, Pamoda B.; de Silva, E.

"Mycorrhizae are an important energy source for orchids that may replace or supplement photosynthesis. Most mature orchids rely on mycorrhizae throughout their life cycles. However, little is known about temporal variation in root endophytic fungal diversity and their trophic functions throughout whole growth periods of the orchids. In this study, the community composition of root endophytic fungi and trophic relationships between root endophytic fungi and orchids were investigated in Bletilla striata and B. ochracea at different phenological stages using stable isotope natural abundance analysis combined with molecular identification analysis. We identified 467 OTUs assigned to root-associated fungal endophytes, which belonged to 25 orders in 10 phyla. Most of these OTUs were assigned to saprotroph (143 OTUs), pathotroph-saprotroph (63 OTUs) and pathotroph-saprotroph-symbiotroph (18 OTUs) using FunGuild database. Among these OTUs, about 54 OTUs could be considered as putative species of orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF). For both Bletilla species, significant temporal variation was observed in the diversity of root endophytic fungi. The florescence and emergence periods had higher fungal community richness of total species and endemic species than did other periods. Both Bletilla species were dominated by Agaricomycetes and Basidiomycota fungi throughout the whole year; however, their abundances varied between two Bletilla species and among phenological stages. Meanwhile, the ranges of C-13 and N-15 natural abundance were also highly dynamic across all growth stages of Bletilla species. Compared with the surrounding autotrophic plants, significant C-13 enrichments (epsilon C-13) were found across all phenological stages, while significant N-15 enrichment in the florescence period and strong N-15 depletion during the fruiting period were found for both Bletilla species. We can deduce that both Bletilla species obtained carbon from root endophytic fungi during the whole year. Additionally, the temporal varying tendency of root endophytic fungal diversity was consistent with C-13 enrichments, which was also accord with the nutritional requirement of plant.","J","Zeng, XH; Diao, HX; Ni, ZY; Shao, L; Jiang, K; Hu, C; Huang, QJ; Huang, WC",NA,"","","Zeng, Xinhua; Diao, Haixin; Ni, Ziyi; Shao, Li; Jiang, Kai; Hu, Chao; Huang, Qingjun; Huang, Weichang",NA,NA,"Temporal Variation in Community Composition of Root Associated Endophytic Fungi and Carbon and Nitrogen Stable Isotope Abundance in Two Bletilla Species (Orchidaceae)","PLANTS-BASEL","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Jiang, Kai/G-1073-2012","Jiang, Kai/0000-0001-9795-9290",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2223-7747","",NA,NA,"JAN",2021,10,"1",NA,"","",NA,"","","18","10.3390/plants10010018","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants10010018","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33374219,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000610718500001","View Full Record in Web of Science",579,"Presence"

"The chronic nature of diabetes mellitus motivates the quest for novel agents to improve its management. The scarcity and prior uncontrolled utilization of medicinal plants have encouraged researchers to seek new sources of promising compounds. Recently, endophytes have presented as eco-friendly leading sources for bioactive metabolites. This article reviewed the endophytic fungi associated with Morus species and their isolated compounds, in addition to the biological activities tested on their extracts and chemical constituents. The relevant literature was collected from the years 2008-2022 from PubMed and Web of Science databases. Notably, no antidiabetic activity was reported for any of the Morus-associated endophytic fungal extracts or their twenty-one previously isolated compounds. This encouraged us to perform an in silico study on the previously isolated compounds to explore their possible antidiabetic potential. Furthermore, pharmacokinetic and dynamic stability studies were performed on these compounds. Upon molecular docking, Colletotrichalactone A (14) showed a promising antidiabetic activity due to the inhibition of the alpha-amylase local target and the human sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (hSGT2) systemic target with safe pharmacokinetic features. These results provide an in silico interpretation of the possible anti-diabetic potential of Morus endophytic metabolites, yet further study is required.","J","AbdelRazek, MMM; Elissawy, AM; Mostafa, NM; Moussa, AY; Elanany, MA; Elshanawany, MA; Singab, ANB",NA,"","","AbdelRazek, Mohamed M.

"Aims This study evaluated the control effect of the endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris B3 against rice bakanae disease (RBD) caused by Fusarium proliferatum and the disease control result of different inoculation times of beneficial micro-organisms. Methods and Results Rice seedlings preinoculated, coinoculated and noninoculated with B3 were exposed to F. proliferatum stress and grown under controlled conditions. Greenhouse experimental results showed that rice preinoculation with B3 significantly reduced rice bakanae disease by 21.45%, inhibited the colonization of F. proliferatum, increased defence-related enzyme activities, upregulated the expression of defence genes and promoted plant photosynthesis. However, bakanae disease in rice coinoculation with B3 increased by 11.45%, resulted in excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) bursts and plant cell death. Conclusions Preinoculation with the endophytic fungus P. liquidambaris B3 significantly reduced rice bakanae disease by triggering the SA-dependent defence pathways of plants, and promoted plant growth. However, coinoculatiton with P. liquidambaris B3 activated excessive defence responses, resulting in plants cell death and aggravation of bakanae disease. Significance and Impact of the Study This study indicated that P. liquidambaris B3 was an effective method for agricultural control against rice bakanae disease caused by F. proliferatum, and provides an experimental basis for the development of sustainable endophytic fungal resources to effectively control plant diseases caused by pathogenic fungi, and suggests that precise application of beneficial micro-organisms may be become a key factor in farmland crop disease management.","J","Zhu, Q; Wu, YB; Chen, M; Lu, F; Sun, K; Tang, MJ; Zhang, W; Bu, YQ; Dai, CC",NA,"","","Zhu, Qiang; Wu, Yi-Bo; Chen, Man; Lu, Fan; Sun, Kai; Tang, Meng-Jun; Zhang, Wei; Bu, Yuan-Qing; Dai, Chuan-Chao",NA,NA,"Preinoculation with Endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris reduced rice bakanae disease caused by Fusarium proliferatum via enhanced plant resistance","JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"wu, yi/JEP-1581-2023; Zhang, Yanchao/JMB-7717-2023","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1364-5072","1365-2672","",NA,NA,"SEP",2022,133,"3",NA,"","",NA,"1566","1580","","10.1111/jam.15656","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jam.15656","","JUN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35686661,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000815858500001","View Full Record in Web of Science",582,"Presence"
"Cynanchum bungei Decne. and its related species C. auriculatum Royle ex Wight. and C. wilfordii (Maxim.) Hemsl. are well known Chinese herbal medicines known by the name Baishouwu, and have a beneficial effect on health. Endophytic fungi exist widely inside host plants and are important components of plant micro ecosystems. Previous studies have shown that there are significant differences among the isolated fungi from the three species of Baishouwu. To explore the fungal diversity in Cynanchum genus, we characterized and compared the endophytic fungal communities among different plant organs, species and localities of Baishouwu by a High-throughput 18S rDNA gene Illumina MiSeq sequencing technique. The results showed that the main factor affecting the distribution and population structure of endophytes was plant organs, rather than the species and localities. Moreover, Rank abundance curves demonstrated that the richness and evenness of JTG was the highest, while the evenness of JTY was the lowest, the richness of JTJ was the lowest. Furthermore, the samples from three localities had relatively similar fungal communities, as indicated by PCA and UPGMA analysis. The Fusarium, Exophiala, Plectosphaerella, Botryosphaeria, and Filobasidium were the predominant fungal genera in the seven samples, which might play an important role in the plant micro -ecosystems and were beneficial to their host plant. These findings contribute to an understanding of the diversity of the endophyte microbiome of Baishouwu and may be beneficial to the rational development and utilization of the medicinal plants.

"Biodegradation of plastic waste through fungal strains offer a solution to serious issues of pollution as fungi are known to release plastic degrading enzymes. In the present study, the isolated endophytic fungi from two endemic plants, Psychotria flavida and Humboldtia brunonis which produced laccase enzymes and grew profusely over hydrophobic surface of plastic films were tested for biodegrading ability. The fungi were inoculated on the polythene and polypropylene films irradiated with different doses of radiation, (0-1000 kGy for Low Density Polyethylene and 0-100 kGy for Polypropylene) and incubated for 90 days. The extent of biodegradation pattern of endophytic fungi was measured for the highest dose mainly by analyzing changes using FUR spectroscopy, DSC, SEM, alteration in viscosity and thereby average molecular weight. The decrease in intrinsic viscosity and average molecular weight of gamma irradiated LDPE strips inoculated with Aspergillus sp., Paecilomyces lilacinus from H. brunonis and Lasiodiplodia theobromae from Psychotria flavida indicate fungal efficiency in plastic degradation. Only L theobromae from P. flavida could degrade irradiated polypropylene film with 0.3 mg on actual weight loss basis.

"Gentian spot blight is a disease that decreases yields. Soil treatment can improve both plant growth and resistance to this disease. We investigated the effectiveness of endophytic fungi fermentation broth combined with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) extractions in the biological control of gentian spot blight. We tested the anti-pathogen and growth-promoting properties of the endophytic fungi 3714, 272 fermentation broth, and 12 different TCM extractions in various solvents alone or in combination. The experiment was conducted in the field by treating gentian with various mixtures and examining their effect in controlling gentian spot blight. The combination of TCM water extractions and endophytic fungi fermentation broth, Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bge (ZM), ZM-272, Cnidium monnieri (L.). Cuss. (SCZ)-3714 and ZM-SCZ-3714 significantly controlled gentian spot blight at a control rate of more than 70%. Analyses of physiological and biochemical indexes, defense enzymes, soil enzymes, and soil properties suggest a mechanism for disease resistance and growth promotion. Specifically, different combination generally increases the number of microorganisms and soil enzyme activities in the rhizosphere of gentian, resulting in improvements in the accumulation of nutrients in soil, as well as the living environment of plants. The accumulation of nutrients in soil was improved by activating defense enzymes. The levels of secondary metabolites such as gentiopicrin increased, thus improving the disease resistance of gentian. Disease resistance was accomplished by directly suppressing the pathogen causing gentian spot blight on the surface of gentian plants and in the soil. These results provide a theoretical foundation for the biological control of gentian spot blight.","J","Wang, FQ; Hu, TS; Han, YY; Zhao, ZL; Ren, SM; Pan, YN; Wang, DM; Liu, XQ",NA,"","","Wang, Fuqi; Hu, Tianshuai; Han, Yangyang; Zhao, Zilu; Ren, Shumeng; Pan, Yingni; Wang, Dongmei; Liu, Xiaoqiu",NA,NA,"Biological control of gentian spot blight by the combination of endophytic fungi fermentation broth and traditional Chinese medicine extractions","PHYSIOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0885-5765","","",NA,NA,"NOV",2023,128,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","102149","10.1016/j.pmpp.2023.102149","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmpp.2023.102149","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001081730100001","View Full Record in Web of Science",585,"Presence"
"Aims: The main objective of the present study was to study the diversity of endophytic fungi from Ruta graveolens, an important medicinal plant. The alkaloids produced by this plant have been used in many medical applications. The endophytic fungi that inhabit the plants are also recognized as rich sources of secondary metabolites. This study was aimed to isolate, identify and study the diversity of endophytic fungi in R. graveolens and to screen the isolates for their antimicrobial activities. Methodology and results: A total of 12 different fungal genera were isolated from R. graveolens collected from various sites in and around Bangalore. The species richness and colonizing frequency of endophytic fungi in this plant are comparatively less than other plants. This may be due to the secretion of the plant's phytochemicals, as it has antimicrobial activity and more than 120 phytochemicals in it. Screening of antimicrobial activity of all 10 isolates was done by agar well diffusion method, of which 80% of the fungal isolates could produce antimicrobials. Conclusion, significance and impact of study: To conclude R. graveolens being a good medicinal plant along with its rich source of endophytes and their medicinal properties, can be exploited for the therapeutic applications.","J","Hanumanthaiah, P; Alurappa, R; Saha, S; Das Chowdhury, C; Guha, P; Hazarika, PR; Hanumaiah, RTD",NA,"","","Hanumanthaiah, Pushpa; Alurappa, Ramesha; Saha, Suchetana; Das Chowdhury, Chandrika; Guha, Pallavi; Hazarika, Pol Robson; Hanumaiah, Ramesh Thirumalesh Dadamudike",NA,NA,"Studies on the biodiversity of endophytic fungi from Ruta graveolens and screening for their antimicrobial activities","MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1823-8262","2231-7538","",NA,NA,"AUG",2023,19,"4",NA,"","",NA,"415","420","","10.21161/mjm.221409","http://dx.doi.org/10.21161/mjm.221409","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001043899800009","View Full Record in Web of Science",586,"Presence"

"Endophytic fungi from Nyctanthes arbor-tristis were isolated and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. A total of 19 endophytic fungi were isolated from 400 segments of healthy leaf and stem tissues of N. arbor-tristis. Eighteen endophytic fungi were obtained from leaf, while only ten from stem. Alternaria alternata had the highest colonization frequency (15.0%) in leaf, whereas Cladosporium cladosporioides ranked first in stem with a colonization frequency of 12%. The diversity and species richness were found higher in leaf tissues than in stem. The similarity indices between leaf and stem were 0.473 for Jaccard's and 0.642 for the Sorenson index, respectively. Of 16, 12 (75%) endophytic fungal extracts showed antibacterial activity against either one or more pathogenic bacteria. The endophytic Nigrospora oryzae showed maximum inhibition against Shigella sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The leaf endophytes Colletotrichum dematium and Chaetomium globosum exhibited a broad range of anibacterial activity and were active against Shigella flexnii, Shigella boydii, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella paratyphi, and P. aeruginosa. Nine out of 16 (56.25%) endophytic fungi exhibited antifungal activity to one or more fungal pathogens.

"Fungal endophytes are attracting much attention and increasingly recognized for their biopharmaceutical potential, especially when their host plants are traditionally used for their medicinal purposes. The relationship between endophytes and their host plants has fascinated many among us especially for their ability to produce structurally unique phytocompounds of significant biopharmaceutical and biomedical importance. This review attempts at providing a comprehensive account on the mangrove fungal endophytic community by compiling research and review articles (from 1990 to 2019). It also covers past and recent publications related to antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxicity properties and emphasizing the potential of isolated metabolites from numerous mangrove fungal endophytes against a panel of human pathogenic microbes and cancer cell lines. It was found that mangrove endophytic fungi are capable to produce an impressive panoply of metabolites with promising biological activities including antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticancer. For instance, Sumalarins A-C isolated from Penicillium sumatrense of Lumnitzera racemosa Willd. and dimethylincisterol, ergosta-5,7,22-trien-3-ol, stigmast-4-en-3-one, stigmast-4-en-6,3-one, flufuran isolated from Pestalotiopsis sp. recovered from Rhizophora mucronata Lam. displayed potent cytotoxic activities against a panel of human cancer cell lines. However, there is stilla dearth of knowledge that necessitates deeper investigation to further understand the relationship between mangrove endophytes and their host plants, especially those pertaining to phytochemicals. The endophytic fungi associated with mangroves are still at an infancy stage since only 27 mangrove species have been pharmacologically validated in terms of their endophytic fungi and thus this marked gap requires more in-depth investigations for a better understanding and clarification of their mechanisms of action.

"Purpose: To isolate and identify the fungal endophytes of Fagopyrum tataricum and assess their antimicrobial activity. Methods: The fungal isolates were identified according to their morphological characters and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analysis. Both broth-dilution-colorimetric assay and spore germination test were employed to assess the antimicrobial activity of fungal mycelia extracts.. Results: A total of 72 endophytic fungal isolates were successfully obtained from the healthy tissues of F. tataricum. On the basis of their morphological and molecular characteristics, thirteen distinct fungal isolates were identified, and belonged to Alternaria, Bionectria, Botryosphaeria, Fusarium, Guignardia, Nectria, Neonectria, Phomopsis, Pseudocercospora and Verticillium spp. Of these, Pseudocercospora owned the maximum colonization frequency (15.3 %), next for Alternaria (12.5 %) and Neonectria (11.1 %). Through antimicrobial screening assays, six endophytes (Fataf-4, 6, 9, 11, 12 and 15) were active against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas lachrymans, and their minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) ranged from 0.125 to 2.00 mg/mL. Furthermore, the endophytes, Fataf-9 and Fataf-11, also displayed strong inhibitory activity on the spore germination of F. oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum and F. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum, and their median effective inhibitory concentration (IC50) was 0.356, 0.463, 0.451 and 0.489 mg/mL, respectively.

"Introduction: Fungus-derived secondary metabolites are fascinating with biomedical potential and chemical diversity. Mining endophytic fungi for drug candidates is an ongoing process in the field of drug discovery and medicinal chemistry. Endophytic fungal symbionts from terrestrial plants, marine flora, and fauna tend to produce interesting types of secondary metabolites with biomedical importance of anticancer, antiviral, and anti-tuberculosis properties. Methods: An organic ethyl acetate extract of Penicillium verruculosum sponge-derived endophytic fungi from Spongia officinalis yielded seven different secondary metabolites which are purified through HPLC. The isolated compounds are of averufin (1), aspergilol-A (2), sulochrin (3), monomethyl sulochrin (4), methyl emodin (5), citreorosein (6), and diorcinol (7). All the seven isolated compounds were characterized by high-resolution NMR spectral studies. All isolated compounds', such as anticancer, antimicrobial, anti-tuberculosis, and antiviral, were subjected to bioactivity screening. Results: Out of seven tested compounds, compound (1) exhibits strong anticancer activity toward myeloid leukemia. HL60 cell lines have an IC50 concentration of 1.00 mu m, which is nearly significant to that of the standard anticancer drug taxol. A virtual computational molecular docking approach of averufin with HL60 antigens revealed that averufin binds strongly with the protein target alpha, beta-tubulin (1JFF), with a -10.98 binding score. Consecutive OSIRIS and Lipinski ADME pharmacokinetic validation of averufin with HL60 antigens revealed that averufin has good pharmacokinetic properties such as drug score, solubility, and mutagenic nature. Furthermore, aspergilol-A (2) is the first report on the Penicillium verruculosum fungal strain. Discussion: We concluded that averufin (1) isolated from Penicillium verruculosum can be taken for further preliminary clinical trials like animal model in-vivo studies and pharmacodynamic studies. A future prospect of in-vivo anticancer screening of averufin can be validated through the present experimental findings.","J","Kaliaperumal, K; Salendra, L; Liu, YH; Ju, ZR; Sahu, SK; Elumalai, S; Subramanian, K; Alotaibi, NM; Alshammari, N; Saeed, M; Karunakaran, R",NA,"","","Kaliaperumal, Kumaravel; Salendra, Limbadri; Liu, Yonghong; Ju, Zhiran; Sahu, Sunil Kumar; Elumalai, Sanniyasi; Subramanian, Kumaran; M.

"Claviceps paspali, a common fungal pathogen of Paspalum grasses, attracts moth vectors by producing sugary exudates in the grass florets it infects. These exudates also support mycoparasitic Fusarium species that may negatively influence C. paspali fitness. We examined the potential for moths on which C. paspali depends to also transmit mycoparasitic Fusarium and fungal endophytes, which inhabit asymptomatic plant tissue and may influence host susceptibility to pathogens. We quantified infections by C. paspali, Fusarium spp., and endophytic fungi associated with Paspalum spp. at focal sites in the southeastern USA and used data from the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS rDNA) to compare communities of plant-associated and moth-borne fungi. ITS sequences of moth-borne fungi were identical to reference sequences of mycoparasitic Fusarium heterosporum and to three distinct endophytic fungi isolated from Paspalum species. Our results demonstrate an unexpected overlap of fungal communities between disparate locations and among plant species and plant tissues, and suggest an unexpected role of moths, which vector a plant pathogen, to transmit other guilds of fungi. In turn, the potential for insects to transmit plant pathogens as well as mycoparasites and endophytic fungi suggests complex interactions underlying a commonly observed grass-pathogen system.","J","Feldman, TS; O'Brien, HE; Arnold, AE",NA,"","","Feldman, Tracy S.; O'Brien, Heath E.; Arnold, A.

"Endophytic fungi play important roles in the modification of ecosystem productivity; however, the underlying mechanisms are only partly understood. A 2-year field plot experiment verified that the endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris increased peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) yields and significantly increased nodulation and N-2 fixation regardless of whether N fertilizers were added. Root exudates collected from P. liquidambaris-colonized plants significantly improved nodulation and N-2 fixation. Rhizosphere stimulation experiments further showed that colonized root exudates had significantly decreased soil nitrate (NO3-) concentrations, with decreased abundance and diversity of ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA). In contrast, the abundance and diversity of diazotrophs significantly increased, and most diazotrophs identified were peanut nodulation-related strains (Bradyrhizobium sp.). P. liquidambaris symbiosis increased the expression of phenolic and flavonoid synthesis-related genes, and the derived phenolics and flavonoids could effectively increase the chemotaxis, biofilm formation, and nodC gene expression (nodulationrelated biological processes) of the Bradyrhizobium strain. Metabolic pattern analysis showed that phenolics and flavonoids are more likely to accumulate to higher levels in the rhizosphere soil of peanuts colonized with P. liquidambaris. Finally, a synthetic root exudate experiment further confirmed the underlying mechanisms for the P. liquidambaris-induced improvement in nodulation and N-2 fixation, i.e., that the specific root exudates derived from P. liquidambaris colonization decrease nitrate concentration and increase the population and biological activities of peanut nodulation-related Bradyrhizobium species, which beneficially enhance peanut-Bradyrhizobium interactions. Therefore, this study is the first to provide new insight into a positive relationship between an exotic endophytic fungus, crop nodulation, and N-2 fixation increase. IMPORTANCE Endophytic fungi play an important role in balancing the ecosystem and boosting host growth; however, the underpinning mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we found that endophytic fungal colonization with P. liquidambaris significantly increased the productivity, nodulation, and N-2 fixation of peanuts through the secretion of specific root exudates. We provide a reasonable mechanism explaining how P. liquidambaris promotes peanut nodulation and N-2 fixation, whereby the specific root exudates produced by P. liquidambaris colonization decrease rhizosphere soil nitrate (NO3(-)) and increase the population and biological activities of peanut-nodulating-related Bradyrhizobium strains, which is beneficial to enhancing the peanut-Bradyrhizobium symbiotic interaction. Our study provides reliable empirical evidence to show the mechanism of how an exotic endophytic fungus drives an increase in nodulation and N-2 fixation, which will be helpful in erecting a resource-efficient and sustainable agricultural system.","J","Xie, XG; Zhang, FM; Yang, T; Chen, Y; Li, XG; Daia, CC",NA,"","","Xie, Xing-Guang; Zhang, Feng-Min; Yang, Teng; Chen, Yan; Li, Xiao-Gang; Daia, Chuan-Chao",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungus Drives Nodulation and N2 Fixation Attributable to Specific Root Exudates","MBIO","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yang, Teng/ABW-3028-2022; 王, 娅冰/JGE-0541-2023; li, xiaogang/ABH-2977-2020","Yang, Teng/0000-0002-8617-4698; Chen, Yan/0000-0001-8354-940X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2150-7511","","",NA,NA,"JUL-AUG",2019,10,"4",NA,"","",NA,"","","e00728-19","10.1128/mBio.00728-19","http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mBio.00728-19","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31311876,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000481617000008","View Full Record in Web of Science",600,"Presence"
"Introduction In addition to the mycotoxin swainsonine, the locoweed endophytic fungus Alternaria oxytropis (Pleosporaceae) also produces a series of rarely reported, highly oxygenated bicyclic guaiane sesquiterpenoids. Few investigations on the electrospray tandem mass fragmentation pattern of this sesquiterpenoid have been reported. Objectives We aimed to analyze and detect new guaiane sesquiterpenoid analogues from crude extracts of the locoweed endophytic fungus A. oxytropis by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS experiments. Materials and Methods Oxytropiols A-J (1-10) and the extract of the locoweed endophytic fungus A. oxytropis were analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS in positive mode. Results Typical neutral losses, McLafferty rearrangement, 1,2-rearrangement, and 1,3-rearrangement were considered to be the main fragmentation patterns for the [M + H](+)/[M + Na](+) ions of 1-10 by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS experiments, and possible fragmentation pathways of 1-10 were suggested. A unique and undescribed analogue named oxytropiol K (11) was found in the extract based on UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis. Compound 11 was isolated and elucidated by NMR spectrometry, and its UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis was consistent with the fragmentation pathways of 1-10. Conclusion The results further support that UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS is a powerful and sensitive tool for the characterization of known compounds (dereplication) and the detection of new analogues from crude extracts and imply that the locoweed endophytic fungus A. oxytropis, with few chemical investigations, is an important resource for undescribed metabolites.","J","Tan, XM; Li, Q; Wang, YD; Wang, TL; Yang, J; Sun, BD; Guo, LP; Ding, G",NA,"","","Tan, Xiang-Mei; Li, Qi; Wang, Yan-Duo; Wang, Tie-Lin; Yang, Jian; Sun, Bing-Da; Guo, Lan-Ping; Ding, Gang",NA,NA,"UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis of the guaiane sesquiterpenoids oxytropiols A-J and detection of undescribed analogues from the locoweed endophytic fungus Alternaria oxytropis (Pleosporaceae)","PHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"tan, xiangmei/GZA-7369-2022","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0958-0344","1099-1565","",NA,NA,"APR",2022,33,"3",NA,"","",NA,"344","354","","10.1002/pca.3092","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.3092","","NOV 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34755399,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000716097400001","View Full Record in Web of Science",601,"Presence"
"Bletilla striata is a terrestrial orchid with high ornamental and medicinal values that is widely interplanted in bamboo forests. However, little is known about the effects of bamboo forest type and density on the growth of B. striata and its symbiotic relationship with root endophytic fungi. In this study, the growth state of B. striata, the community composition and diversity of its root endophytic fungal, and the fungal nutritional function were investigated in Phyllostachys edulis, P. iridescens and P. glauca forests with three densities. We found that the type and density of the bamboo forest had significant effects on the growth of B. striata, with the biomass, leaf width, root quantity and width being the highest in the low-density of the P. edulis forest. The community composition and abundance of root endophytic fungi in B. striata varied among different bamboo forests and densities, with P. edulis and P. iridescens forests dominated by Basidiomycota and Serendipita, while P. glauca prevailed by Ascomycota and Dactylonectria. The trophic modes of root endophytic fungi were also affected by forest types and densities. The abundance of symbiotroph fungi was the highest in P. edulis and P. iridescens forests and greatly varied with density gradient, and saprotrophic fungi comprised the highest proportion in the Ph. glauca forest. These results provide basic data for further research and the configuration between bamboo species and terrestrial orchids.","J","Fu, H; Song, ZL; Li, SM; Lan, SR; Zeng, XH; Huang, WC",NA,"","","Fu, Hao; Song, Zhilin; Li, Shanmin; Lan, Siren; Zeng, Xinhua; Huang, Weichang",NA,NA,"Effects of Bamboo Forest Type and Density on the Growth of Bletilla striata and Root Endophytic Fungi","DIVERSITY-BASEL","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1424-2818","",NA,NA,"MAY",2022,14,"5",NA,"","",NA,"","","391","10.3390/d14050391","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14050391","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000802500200001","View Full Record in Web of Science",602,"Presence"
"Background: Present study focuses on diversity and distribution analysis of endophytic fungi associated with different tissues of Eugenia jambolana. The influence of season and geographical location on diversity and distribution of endophytic fungi has been analyzed. Antibacterial activity of isolated fungal species has also been investigated against MDR bacterial strains. Result: A total of 1896 endophytic fungal isolates were obtained from healthy, surface sterilized tissues of leaf, stem and petiole tissues during summer, monsoon and winter season. Out of 24 fungal species isolated, 20 species belong to class Ascomycetes, 2 to Basidiomycetes and 2 to Zygomycetes. Maximum species diversity was in rainy season whereas colonization frequency was in winter. All the diversity indices showed maximum species diversity at site 5 (Yamunanager), rainy among the seasons and leaf among the tissues studied. Aspergillus genus was most frequently isolated. Aspergillus niger and Alternaria alternata were most dominant species. Three way ANOVA results showed that effect of season was highly significant on species diversity in relation to sites and tissues. 60 % endophytic fungal extracts showed significant antibacterial activity against one or more than one MDR bacterial strain. Conclusion: Different fungal species were recovered from different sites but the inter-site comparisons were not significant according to Jaccard similarity coefficient. Diversity of such fungal endophytes indicates that Eugenia jambolana plant acts as an ecosystem facilitating survival of many microbes with impressive antibacterial potential.","J","Yadav, M; Yadav, A; Kumar, S; Yadav, JP",NA,"","","Yadav, Manila; Yadav, Amita; Kumar, Sandeep; Yadav, Jaya Parkash",NA,NA,"Spatial and seasonal influences on culturable endophytic mycobiota associated with different tissues of Eugenia jambolana Lam. and their antibacterial activity against MDR strains","BMC MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yadav, J.

"Endophytic fungi inside a plant can degrade a portion of plant lignin and cellulose. Endophytic Penicillium is one of the industrial microorganisms with the advantage of producing enzymes with a complete enzyme system that can be secreted into the extracellular space. The natural evolution of ancient tree species from special natural geographic environments to screen out cellulase-producing strains with excellent characteristics provides a promising direction for future industrial enzymes. The present study successfully isolated and screened a novel fungal endophyte, Penicillium oxalicum R4, with higher cellulase activity from Taxus cuspidata. Under the optimized culture conditions obtained by a Box-Behnken design (BBD) and an artificial neural network-genetic algorithm (ANN-GA), yields of Filter Paperase (FPase), Carboxymethyl Cellulase (CMCase) and beta-glucosidase (beta GLase) produced by P. oxalicum R4 were 1.45, 5.27 and 6.35 U/mL, which were approximately 1.60-fold, 1.59-fold and 2.16-fold higher than those of the non-optimized culture, respectively.

"Mutualistic fungi are known to increase plant tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress. Therefore, it is expected that along aridity gradients the diversity and composition of symbiotic fungal community will be associated with climate. We examined the diversity of foliar endophytic fungi, inhabiting an annual grass, growing in three different climates (arid, Mediterranean, and wet Mediterranean) along the Israeli aridity gradient. Among the identified endophyte taxa, some were unique to each site, some were common to the two sites located in the extremes of the gradient, but none was common to all sites. Although most fungal endophyte taxa identified were not related to stress adaptation, we detected two that are considered to benefit plants by mitigating stress: Cladosporium and Trichoderma. Cladosporium is highly osmotolerant, frequently found in saline environments. Trichoderma is a biocontrol agent, frequently found in mesic environments. These findings support the hypothesis that species composition of foliar endophytic fungi is associated with stress adaptation of plants.","J","Penner, S; Sapir, Y",NA,"","","Penner, Shira; Sapir, Yuval",NA,NA,"Foliar Endophytic Fungi Inhabiting an Annual Grass Along an Aridity Gradient","CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Penner, Shira/0000-0001-5360-5415",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0343-8651","1432-0991","",NA,NA,"MAY",2021,78,"5",NA,"","",NA,"2080","2090","","10.1007/s00284-021-02437-5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-021-02437-5","","MAR 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33765191,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000632787000004","View Full Record in Web of Science",605,"Presence"
"Wheat production is influenced by changing environmental conditions, including climatic conditions, which results in the changing composition of microorganisms interacting with this cereal. The group of these microorganisms includes not only endophytic fungi associated with the wheat endosphere, both pathogenic and symbiotic, but also those with yet unrecognized functions and consequences for wheat. This paper reviews the literature in the context of the general characteristics of endophytic fungi inhabiting the internal tissues of wheat. In addition, the importance of epigenetic regulation in wheat-fungus interactions is recognized and the current state of knowledge is demonstrated. The possibilities of using symbiotic endophytic fungi in modern agronomy and wheat cultivation are also proposed. The fact that the current understanding of fungal endophytes in wheat is based on a rather small set of experimental conditions, including wheat genotypes, plant organs, plant tissues, plant development stage, or environmental conditions, is recognized. In addition, most of the research to date has been based on culture-dependent methods that exclude biotrophic and slow-growing species and favor the detection of fast-growing fungi. Additionally, only a few reports of studies on the entire wheat microbiome using high-throughput sequencing techniques exist. Conducting comprehensive research on the mycobiome of the endosphere of wheat, mainly in the context of the possibility of using this knowledge to improve the methods of wheat management, mainly the productivity and health of this cereal, is needed.","J","Blaszczyk, L; Salamon, S; Mikolajczak, K",NA,"","","Blaszczyk, Lidia; Salamon, Sylwia; Mikolajczak, Katarzyna",NA,NA,"Fungi Inhabiting the Wheat Endosphere","PATHOGENS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Błaszczyk, Lidia/ABF-3544-2020","Błaszczyk, Lidia/0000-0001-5972-4896; Mikolajczak, Katarzyna/0000-0003-1962-9856; Salamon, Sylwia/0000-0002-1792-0845",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2076-0817","",NA,NA,"OCT",2021,10,"10",NA,"","",NA,"","","1288","10.3390/pathogens10101288","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10101288","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34684238,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000713860900001","View Full Record in Web of Science",606,"Presence"
"Myricaria laxiflora is distributed along the riverbanks of the Yangtze River valley. The Three Gorges Dam has dramatically changed the habitat of M. laxiflora, which has evolved to develop increased resistance to flooding stress. In order to elucidate the relationship between plant endophytic fungi and flooding stress, we isolated and taxonomically characterized the endophytic fungi of M. laxiflora. One hundred and sixty-three fungi were isolated from healthy stems, leaves and roots of M. laxiflora grown under pre- and post-flooding conditions. Culture and isolation were carried out under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Based on internal transcribed spacer sequence analysis and morphological characteristics, the isolates exhibited abundant biodiversity; they were classified into 5 subphyla, 7 classes, 12 orders, 17 families, and 26 genera. Dominant endophytes varied between pre- and post-flooding plants, among different plant tissues, and between aerobic and anaerobic culture conditions. Aspergillus and Alternaria accounted for more than 55% of all isolates. Although the number of isolates from post-flooding plants was greater, endophytes from pre-flooding plants were more diverse and abundant. Endophytes were distributed preferentially in particular tissues; this affinity was constrained by both the host habitat and the oxygen availability of the host.","J","Tian, W; Bi, YH; Zeng, W; Jiang, W; Xue, YH; Wang, GX; Liu, SP",NA,"","","Tian, W.; Bi, Y.

"Endophytic fungal communities of Dysphania ambrosioides, a hyperaccumulator growing at two Pb-Zn-contaminated sites, were investigated through culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. A total of 237 culturable endophytic fungi (EF) were isolated from 368 tissue (shoot and roots) segments, and the colonization rate (CR) ranged from 9.64% to 65.98%. The isolates were identified to 43 taxa based on morphological characteristics and rDNA ITS sequence analysis. Among them, 13 taxa (30.23%) were common in plant tissues from both sites; however, dominant EF were dissimilar. In culture-dependent study, 1989 OTUs were obtained through Illumina Miseq sequencing, and dominant EF were almost same in plant tissues from both sites. However, some culturable EF were not observed in total endophytic communities. We suggest that combination of both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods will provide more chances for the precise estimation of endophytic fungal community than using either of them. The tissue had more influence on the culturable fungal community structure, whereas the location had more influence on the total fungal community structure (including culturable and unculturable). Both culture-dependent and culture-independent studies illustrated that endophytic fungal communities of D.ambrosioides varied across the sites, which suggested that HM concentration of the soil may have some influence on endophytic fungal diversity.","J","Parmar, S; Li, QH; Wu, Y; Li, XY; Yan, JP; Sharma, VK; Wei, YL; Li, HY",NA,"","","Parmar, Shobhika; Li, Qiaohong; Wu, Ying; Li, Xinya; Yan, Jinping; Sharma, Vijay K.; Wei, Yunlin; Li, Haiyan",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungal community of Dysphania ambrosioides from two heavy metal-contaminated sites: evaluated by culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches","MICROBIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"jiang, lei/IWE-1124-2023; Sharma, Vijay Kumar K/E-3541-2019; Sharma, Vijay Kumar/J-5353-2019","Sharma, Vijay Kumar K/0000-0002-2330-5830; Wei, Yunlin/0000-0003-3745-9707; Parmar, Shobhika/0000-0002-5557-7363",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1751-7915","","",NA,NA,"NOV",2018,11,"6",NA,"","",NA,"1170","1183","","10.1111/1751-7915.13308","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1751-7915.13308","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30256529,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000447866700020","View Full Record in Web of Science",608,"Presence"
"Endophyte fungi reside in the tissues beneath the epidermal cell layers and live within a plant for at least part of its life without causing apparent diseases. Eight morphologically distinct endophytic fungi were selected from the medicinal plants Elaeocarpus sphaericus coded as ELSPF 1 to 4 and Myristica fragrans coded as MYFRF 1 to 4. The highest colonization frequencies (CF %) were found to be 12.69%, and 8.33% for ELSPF 1 and MYFRF 2. Internal transcribed spacer-polymerase chain was performed for molecular identification and similar to 600 bp amplified products were obtained. The sequences were analysed by BLAST and the phylogenetic tree was constructed with neighbour joining method. The fungi were cultured on Potato Dextrose broth for production metabolites. The metabolites were extracted with ethyl acetate and constituent phytochemicals were analyzed. The crude extracts were tested for antimicrobial activity by agar well diffusion method. The test organisms used for the antimicrobial activity studies were E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebliella pneumonia. The ethyl acetate extracts of all endophytic fungi showed antimicrobial activity except MYFRF-1 against E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebliella pneumonia.","J","Deepthi, VC; Sumathi, S; Faisal, M; Elyas, KK",NA,"","","Deepthi, V.

"Cherry-red  tobacco is the superior variant of tobacco, appearing with the apperance of red dapples on cured leaves due to the demethylation of nicotine to nornicotine during maturation and curing. Fungi are known to have the capacity to convert nicotine to nornicotine. However, an endophytic fungal community of cherry-red  tobacco has never been reported to our best knowledge. Here, we sampled mature leaves from both cherry-red  and ordinary tobacco at lower, center, and upper plant sections, and we analyzed the ITS diversity using high-throughput sequencing. Results revealed a significantly different fungal community of foliar endophyte in cherry-red  and ordinary tobacco. In comparison to the ordinary control, higher diversity and a co-occurrence network complex were found in cherry-red  samples, especially in the center and upper leaves, where the red dapples mainly emerged. More taxa were enriched in the cherry-red  than ordinary tobacco leaves at all plant sections. In particular, Aspergillus, some strains of which are reported capable of converting nicotine to nornicotine, was specifically enriched in upper cherry-red  tobacco leaves, which showed most red dapples after curing. A less robust network structure was detected in the cherry-red  tobacco compared to ordinary tobacco. The nearest taxon index (NTI) and beta NTI indicated that the local community structuration of tobacco endophytic fungi mainly driven by deterministic process, while the community turnover among plant sections was stochastic. In conclusion, our study provides the earliest information of endophytic fungal community in cherry-red  tobacco leaf, and the community diversity, composition, and network features are synchronously varied with the appearance of red dapples, which is suggestive of their relationship to the formation of cherry-red  tobacco.","J","Jiang, YL; Chen, X; Zhao, GK; Liu, JH; Xie, Y; Li, Y; Gu, HG; Zou, CM",NA,"","","Jiang, Yonglei; Chen, Xing; Zhao, Gaokun; Liu, Jiahong; Xie, Yan; Li, Yong; Gu, Huaguo; Zou, Congming",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungal Community of Tobacco Leaves and Their Potential Role in the Formation of Cherry-Red Tobacco","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1664-302X","",NA,NA,"JUL 16",2021,12,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","658116","10.3389/fmicb.2021.658116","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.658116","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34335492,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000679964400001","View Full Record in Web of Science",612,"Presence"

"Seed treatment with endophytic fungi has been regarded as an effective method for plant parasitic nematode control. Endophytic fungi from cucumber seedlings were isolated and screened for their potential to be used as seed treatment agents against Meloidogyne incognita. Among the 294 isolates screened, 23 significantly reduced galls formed by M. incognita in greenhouse test. The 10 most effective isolates were Fusarium (5), Trichoderma (1), Chaetomium (1), Acremonium (1), Paecilomyces (1), and Phyllosticta (1). Their control efficacies were repeatedly tested and their colonizations as well as in vitro activity against M. incognita were studied. They reduced the number of galls by 24.0%-58.4% in the first screening and 15.6%-44.3% in the repeated test, respectively. Phyllosticta Ph511 and Chaetomium Ch1001 had high colonizations on both the roots and the aboveground parts of cucumber seedlings. Fusarium isolates had colonization preference on the roots, their root colonizations ranging from 20.1% to 47.3% of the total root area. Trichoderma Tr882, Paecilomyces Pa972, and Acremonium Ac985 had low colonizations on both the roots and the aboveground parts. Acremonium Ac985, Chaetomium Ch1001, Paecilomyces Pa972, and Phyllosticta Ph511 produced compounds affecting motility of the second stage juveniles of M. incognita.

"Aim To investigate the bioactive metabolite of endophytic fungus from Kalimeris indica. Methods and Results A strain ZJLQ336 was separated from the leaves of K. indica. It was identified as Cadophora orchidicola based on the phylogenetic analysis of ITS-rDNA sequences. From the fermentation broth a metabolite cercosporamide (compound 1) was isolated, and its structure was determined by spectroscopic analysis. Additionally, this compound was subjected to bioactivity assays, including antifungal activity against seven plant pathogenic fungi, as well as its potential immunoregulatory effects on HEK-BLUE (TM)-hTLR4 cells, splenocytes and macrophages. The results showed that cercosporamide had strong growth inhibition against five common plant pathogenic fungi, including Pestalotia diospyri, Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum, Sclerotium rolfsii and Penicillum digitatum with EC50 values of 5 center dot 29 x 10(-3), 0 center dot 61, 0 center dot 93, 2 center dot 89 and 6 center dot 7 mu g ml(-1) respectively. Among which S. rolfsii was one of the main pathogens in K. indica. Moreover, cercosporamide not only significantly stimulated TLR4 activation, splenocyte proliferation and production of cytokines, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, but also up-regulated the production of TNF-alpha and NO in RAW264.7 macrophages clearly. Conclusions This is the first report of endophytic C. orchidicola from K. indica and its metabolite cercosporamide. The results of pharmacological tests highlight the potential fungicide and TLR4 agonist of cercosporamide.

"Foliar fungal endophytes are an important plant-associated fungal group. However, little is known about these fungi in hemi-parasitic plants, a unique plant group which derive nutrients from living plants of its hosts by haustoria while are photosynthetic to some degree. In this paper, the endophytic fungi in the leaves of a species of hemi-parasitic plant, Macrosolen cochinchinensis, were studied by both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. By culture-dependent method, a total of 511 isolates were recovered from 452 of 600 leaf fragments (colonization rate = 75.3 %) and were identified to be 51 taxa. Valsa sp. was the most abundant (relative abundance = 38.4 %), followed by Cladosporium sp. 1 (13.5 %), Ulocladium sp. (4.3 %), Phomopsis sp. 2 (3.7 %), Hendersonia sp. (3.5 %), and Diaporthe sp. 4 (3.5 %). The Shannon index (H') of the isolated endophytic fungi was 2.628, indicating a moderate diversity. By culture-independent method, Aspergillus spp., Cladosporium sp., Mycosphaerella sp., Acremonium strictum, and Tremella sp. were detected. To our knowledge, the Tremella species have never been detected as endophytes so far. In addition, a cloned sequence was not similar with any current sequence in the Genbank, which may represent a novel species.

"Throughout history, mankind has used plants as their primary source of sustainability, in agricultural commodities, clothing, fragrances, fertilizers, flavours, and providing shelter. There is a strong symbiotic relationship between the plant and its endophytes. Endophytes are harboured within the living plant tissues without causing neither diseases nor symptoms. They produce bioactive compounds that protect the host plants against attack of insects, pathogens and herbivores. The bioactive compounds might be utilized for pharmaceutical, agricultural, or biotechnological applications.This paper reported on the various endophytic fungi strains that were isolated from isolated from a medicinal plant, Sceletium tortuosum. Fifty Sceletium tortuosum plants were collected from three different provinces in South Africa and leaves and roots used to isolate culturable endophytes. Morphological characteristics and a genus specific PCR designed to amplify fungal internal transcribe spacer (ITS) region (ITS1 and ITS4) and elongation factor (EF 1 and 2) was used for identification. A total of 60 fungal isolates belonging to 16 genera were identified and classified. Isolates were identified to species level based on similarities with known sequences in GenBank and a large proportion of the fungi were Fusarium species (37%) followed Aspergillus (25%) and Penicillium (7%) species.

"Endophytic fungi are those fungi that are able to grow in plant tissue without causing symptoms of disease. It is thought that these fungi may confer on the host plants degree of resistance to parasitic invasion. Endophytic fungi have been isolated from stem tissue and these fungi are known to be antagonistic to pathogenic fungi. These endophytes produce chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase enzymes. Based on the fact that chitin and beta-1,3-glucan are the main skeletal polysaccharides of the cell walls of fungal patogen. The aim of this research is to do potential test on some of isolates of Trichoderma's endophytic (L-1,L-2, Is-1, Is-2 and Is-7) in the chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase activity in effort to determine endophytic which be chossen to be gene resource for the next research. The gene will be transformed to citrus plant japanese citroen in effort to make citrus plant transgenic resistance to phytopatogenic invasion. The result of this research is endofit namely L-1 is the most potential endophytic fungi with chitinase activities is 4,8 10(-2) Unit and glucanase 24,2. 10(12) Unit. The addition of chitin and cell wall of phytophtora causes chitinase activity significantly increase, and also addition of laminarin and cell wall of phytophtora makes glucanase activity increase.","C","Prasetyawan, S; Sulistyowati, L; Aulanni'am",NA,"","IOP","Prasetyawan, Sasangka; Sulistyowati, Lilik; Aulanni'am",NA,NA,"Glucanase and Chitinase from Some Isolates of Endophytic Fungus Trichoderma spp.","INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CHEMISTRY AND MATERIAL SCIENCE (IC2MS) 2017","IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering",NA,NA,NA,"International Conference on Chemistry and Material Science (IC2MS)","NOV 04-05, 2017","Malang, INDONESIA","Brawijaya Univ, Chem Dept,Brawijaya Univ,Collaborat Res Ctr Adv Syst & Mat Technol,PT Ditek Jaya,DJ Labware","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Aulanni'am, Aulanni'am/AEV-6139-2022","Aulanni'am, Aulanni'am/0000-0002-8715-4592; Prasetyawan, Sasangka/0000-0002-9490-5876",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1757-8981","","",NA,NA,"",2018,299,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","12026","10.1088/1757-899X/299/1/012026","http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/299/1/012026","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000446181700025","View Full Record in Web of Science",619,"Presence"
"In this study, a total of 161 endophytic fungal isolates from Camptotheca acuminata were obtained and classified to 16 taxa according to morphological and molecular analysis. These taxa were composed of 2 frequent genera (Botryosphaeria and Fusarium) and 14 infrequent groups such as Xylaria, Diaporthe, Rhizopus, Epicoccum, and Preussia, demonstrating that fungal endophytes in C. acuminata were highly abundant and diverse. Antimicrobial activity screening using filter-paper diffusion method showed that 47.6 % of the tested isolates had antimicrobial activity against at least one of the test microorganisms. Screening of fungal endophyte-derived camptothecin analogues by TLC and LC-MS/MS3 demonstrated that a strain Botryosphaeria dothidea, X-4 could produce 9-methoxycamptothecin (9-MCPT) when cultured in Sabouraud's dextrose broth for 12 days under shake flask and bench-scale fermention conditions. This work showed that the fungal endophytes from C. acuminata could be an alternative source for the production of 9-MCPT and other natural antimicrobial compounds.","J","Ding, XW; Liu, KH; Deng, BW; Chen, WQ; Li, WJ; Liu, FH",NA,"","","Ding, Xiaowei; Liu, Kaihui; Deng, Baiwan; Chen, Wenqiang; Li, Wenjun; Liu, Feihu",NA,NA,"Isolation and characterization of endophytic fungi from Camptotheca acuminata","WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Li, Wen-Jun/ACA-8525-2022","Li, Wen-Jun/0000-0002-1233-736X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0959-3993","","",NA,NA,"OCT",2013,29,"10",NA,"","",NA,"1831","1838","","10.1007/s11274-013-1345-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-013-1345-x","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,23579767,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000325035100010","View Full Record in Web of Science",620,"Presence"

"Many compounds produced by fungi have relevant pharmaceutical applications. The purpose of this study was to collect and isolate endophytic fungi from different regions of Panama and then to test their potential therapeutic activities against Leishmania donovani, Plasmodium falciparum, and Trypanosoma cruzi as well as their anticancer activities in MCF-7 cells. Of the 25 fungal isolates obtained, ten of them had good anti-parasitic potential, showing selective activity against L. donovani; four had significant anti-malarial activity; and three inhibited the growth of T. cruzi. Anticancer activity was demonstrated in four isolates. Of the active isolates, Edenia sp. strain F0755, Xylaria sp. strain F1220, Aspergillus sp. strain F1544, Mycoleptodiscus sp. strain F0194, Phomopsis sp. strain F1566, Pycnoporus sp. strain F0305, and Diaporthe sp. strain F1647 showed the most promise based on their selective bioactivity and lack of toxicity in the assays.

"Antiretroviral treatment has significantly reduced human immunodeficiency virus infection and mortality. However, the current treatment regimen is limited by adverse side effects, the emergence of drug resistance, and the inability to eliminate viral reservoirs. Here, fifteen endophytic fungi were isolated from Sclerocarya birrea and Hypoxis plants. Crude extracts of Alternaria alternata (strain ID PO4PR1, PO4PR2, and PO2PL1) of the fifteen isolate's crude extracts showed anti-HIV-1 activity in TZM-bl cell line at inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging from 0.017 to 1.170 mu g/ml. The three crude extracts also maintained the virus replication inhibition profile on PBMCs and CD4(+) T cells at concentrations ranging from 0.3 to 50.2 ng/ml. Partial purification using the solid phase extraction and analysis with Gas Chromatography-Mass spectrophotometry showed a diverse profile. The bioactive compounds were identified based on peak area, retention time, similarity index. The major compounds from GC-MS analysis of A. Alternata revealed the existence of cyclotrisiloxane octamethyl (22.92%); Propaninitrile (16,67%); Pyrrolol[1,2-a]pyrazine-1,4-dione, hexahydro-3-(2-methyl propyl) (10.42%); Silane, diethylethoxy(2-ethoxyethyloxy) (4.17%); Coumarin, 3,4-dihydro-4,5,7-trimethyl- 4,5,7-Trimethyl-2-chromanone (13.7%) and 1,2-Cyclobutanedicarbonitrile (2.08%) with previously reported biological activities such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Therefore, these bioactive compounds from A. alternata fungal endophytes could be repurposed as potential anti-HIV agents. This study showed the potential of endophytic fungi, Alternaria alternata from S. birrea, and Hypoxis species as producers of anti-HIV compounds.","J","Nzimande, B; Kumalo, HM; Ndlovu, SI; Mkhwanazi, NP",NA,"","","Nzimande, Bruce; Kumalo, Hezekiel M.; Ndlovu, Sizwe I.; Mkhwanazi, Nompumelelo P.",NA,NA,"Secondary metabolites produced by endophytic fungi, Alternaria alternata, as potential inhibitors of the human immunodeficiency virus","FRONTIERS IN GENETICS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Kumalo, Hezekiel/0000-0002-4037-1549; NZIMANDE, BRUCE/0000-0002-6584-1308; Mkhwanazi, Nompumelelo Prudence/0000-0002-0808-9201; Ndlovu, Sizwe/0000-0002-2323-282X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1664-8021","",NA,NA,"DEC 13",2022,13,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","1077159","10.3389/fgene.2022.1077159","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2022.1077159","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36583026,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000900400400001","View Full Record in Web of Science",623,"Presence"
"Polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) released from vehicular emissions and oil refineries deposit on the phyllosphere, compromising the quality of leaf-based food products by posing many health issues. Nevertheless, the tea phyllosphere harbours a variety of endophytes that are highly effective at degrading polyaromatic hydrocarbons, anthracene, and pyrene. The present study attempts to analyse the pyrene and anthracene degrading capability of phyllosphere endophytic fungi that inhabit Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze leaves. The frequency of occurrence of endophytic fungi in different leaf tissue layers was examined using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The best pyrene and anthracene degrading strains were selected based on the High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) results, and further kinetic assays. Light microscopy and SEM observations highlighted a heterogeneous endophytic fungal distribution among leaf tissue layers; the upper epidermis had the highest fungal distribution compared to other leaf layers. HPLC results revealed that Phyllosticta capitalensis, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Colletotrichum siamense, Pseudopestalotiopsis chinensis, and Daldinia eschscholtzii, have higher pyrene and anthracene degradation respectively and their PAH degradation kinetics follow the first-order kinetic model. The best anthracene and pyrene degrader, P. capitalensis showed the lowest half-life. The present investigation highlights the potential of P. capitalensis, the best pyrene and anthracene degrader that can remediate PAHs deposited on the phyllosphere of tea leaves.","J","Undugoda, L; Thambugala, K; Kannangara, S; Munasinghe, J; Premarathna, N; Dharmasiri, N",NA,"","","Undugoda, Lanka; Thambugala, Kasun; Kannangara, Sagarika; Munasinghe, Jayantha; Premarathna, Nadeeka; Dharmasiri, Nadeema",NA,NA,"Phylloremediation of pyrene and anthracene by endophytic fungi inhabiting tea leaves (Camellia sinensis (L.)

"Background: Endophytic fungi are associated within plant tissues without any harmful effects. They produce a diversity of metabolites and are well known as rich source of bioactive substances. This study aimed to identify fungal isolates from different medicinal plants, evaluate their antioxidant potency and detect components responsible for antioxidant activity. Results: In the present investigation, 4 endophytic fungal isolates were obtained from different medicinal plants Rumex nervosus, Pulicaria crispa and Withania somnifera. Those isolates were characterized as Penicilluim commune, Penicilluim glaucoroseum, Aspergillus flavipes and Fusarium chlamydosporum according to morphological and phylogenetic bases. These strains were propagated on humified rice and their crude ethyl acetate extracts were assayed for their total phenols, flavonoids and antioxidant potency against DPPH free radicals. The results showed that the elevated constituent of phenolics was found in P. commune (148.24 mg/g), followed by F. chlamydosporum (124.25 mg/g), while the highest total flavonoids were determined in A. flavipes, followed by F. chlamydosporum, P. glaucoroseum, P. commune, respectively. Moreover, the maximum hydroxyl radical-scavenging assay was IC50 = 2.13 mg/mL exhibited by P. commune, followed by F. chlamydosporum (2.68 mg/mL). Weak antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects were reported by the studied strains against pathogenic isolates and (HepG2) hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. The fungal EtOAc extracts were characterized quantitatively by the incidence of different phenols, flavonoids, and phenolic acids, as detected by HPLC. Conclusions: Endophytic fungi derived from medicinal plants are a promising candidate for the wide industrial production of antioxidant agents with several useful medical and pharmaceutical applications.

"Endophytic fungi of crops can promote plant growth through various mechanisms of action (i.e., improve nutrient uptake and nutrient use efficiency, and produce and modulate plant hormones). The genus Brassica includes important horticultural crops, which have been little studied in their interaction with endophytic fungi. Previously, four endophytic fungi were isolated from kale roots (Brassica oleracea var. acephala), with different benefits for their host, including plant growth promotion, cold tolerance, and induction of resistance to pathogens (Xanthomonas campestris) and pests (Mamestra brassicae). In the present work, the molecular and morphological identification of the four different isolates were carried out, describing them as the species Acrocalymma vagum, Setophoma terrestris, Fusarium oxysporum, and the new species Pyrenophora gallaeciana. In addition, using a representative crop of each Brassica U's triangle species and various in vitro biochemical tests, the ability of these fungi to promote plant growth was described. In this sense, the four fungi used promoted the growth of B. rapa, B. napus, B. nigra, B. juncea, and B. carinata, possibly due to the production of auxins, siderophores, P solubilization or cellulase, xylanase or amylase activity. Finally, the differences in root colonization between the four endophytic fungi and two pathogens (Leptosphaeria maculans and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum) and the root glucosinolate profile were studied, at different times. In this way, how the presence of progoitrin in the roots reduces their colonization by endophytic and pathogenic fungi was determined, while the possible hydrolysis of sinigrin to fungicidal products controls the colonization of endophytic fungi, but not of pathogens.","J","Poveda, J; Rodríguez, VM; Díaz-Urbano, M; Sklenár, F; Saati-Santamaría, Z; Menéndez, E; Velasco, P",NA,"","","Poveda, Jorge; Rodriguez, Victor M.; Diaz-Urbano, Maria; Sklenar, Frantisek; Saati-Santamaria, Zaki; Menendez, Esther; Velasco, Pablo",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi from kale (Brassica oleracea var. acephala) modify roots-glucosinolate profile and promote plant growth in cultivated Brassica species.

"Managing triphenylmethane class of dyes such as aniline blue present in the effluents is a nightmare for the industries and environmentalists. There are physical and chemical approaches available for degrading these recalcitrant dyes. However, these methods become expensive process and also degraded products are not ecofriendly in nature. Laccase from white rot fungi had been used for biotransformation of triphenylmethane class of dyes except for aniline blue. This study focussed on laccase from gamma irradiated endophytic fungus (Phomopsis sp.) and its enhanced activity in degrading aniline blue as well as textile dye effluent. Laccase production was increased in 1.2 kGy gamma irradiated endophytic fungus (2 fold) and hence dye degradation was enhanced when compared to the non-irradiated (wild) fungus. The laccase activity exhibited appreciable stability for metal ions (Zn2+, Cu2+, Cr2+ and Ca2+) up to 10 mM concentration. The highest laccase activity and dye decolourisation rate was observed around 30 degrees C temperature at pH 5. The degraded intermediates were identified and a mechanism of degradation was proposed based on UV-vis, FTIR and LC-MS analysis. The aniline blue degradation kinetics strictly followed Michaelis-Menten model. The degraded aniline blue dye samples had reduced COD and were non-toxic to plants and microorganisms. To substantiate the industrial application, textile effluent was treated with laccase from the endophytic fungus and found 99 % decolourisation within 2.5 h. There was a 67 % reduction in COD and a 47 % reduction in BOD in laccase mediated textile effluent treatment.","J","Navada, KK; Kulal, A",NA,"","","Navada, Kavitha Keshava; Kulal, Ananda",NA,NA,"Enhanced production of laccase from gamma irradiated endophytic fungus: A study on biotransformation kinetics of aniline blue and textile effluent decolourisation","JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kulal, Ananda/B-1140-2015","Kulal, Ananda/0000-0003-2628-1966",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2213-2929","2213-3437","",NA,NA,"APR",2020,8,"2",NA,"","",NA,"","","103550","10.1016/j.jece.2019.103550","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jece.2019.103550","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000524743700041","View Full Record in Web of Science",627,"Presence"
"There is continuing need for new and improved drugs to tackle malaria, which remains a major public health problem, especially in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Natural products represent credible sources of new antiplasmodial agents for antimalarial drug development. Endophytes that widely colonize healthy tissues of plants have been shown to synthesize a great variety of secondary metabolites that might possess antiplasmodial benefits. The present study was carried out to evaluate the antiplasmodial potential of extracts from endophytic fungi isolated from Symphonia globulifera against a chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum (PfINDO). Sixty-one fungal isolates with infection frequency of 67.77% were obtained from the bark of S. globulifera. Twelve selected isolates were classified into six different genera including Fusarium, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Mucor, and Bipolaris. Extracts from the 12 isolates were tested against PfINDO, and nine showed good activity (IC50 < 10 mu g.mL(-1)) with three fungi including Paecilomyces lilacinus (IC50 = 0.44 mu g.mL(-1)), Penicillium janthinellum (IC50 = 0.2 mu g.mL(-1)), and Paecilomyces sp. (IC50 = 0.55 mu g.mL(-1)) showing the highest promise. These three isolates were found to be less cytotoxic against the HEK293T cell line with selectivity indices ranging from 24.52 to 70.56. Results from this study indicate that endophytic fungi from Symphonia globulifera are promising sources of hit compounds that might be further investigated as novel drugs against malaria. The chemical investigation of active extracts is ongoing.","J","Ateba, JET; Toghueo, RMK; Awantu, AF; Mba'ning, BM; Gohlke, S; Sahal, D; Rodrigues, E; Tsamo, E; Boyom, FF; Sewald, N; Lenta, BN",NA,"","","Ateba, Joel E.

"Opuntia ficus-indica Mill. (forage cactus) is farmed with relative success in the semi-arid region of the Brazilian northeast for commercial purposes, particularly as forage and food. Endophytic microorganisms are those that can be isolated inside plant tissues and can be a new source to production of enzymes with different potentialities. The objective of this study was to describe the richness of endophytic fungi from O. ficus-indica and to detect the capacity of these species to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. Forty-four endophytic fungi species were isolated. Among them, the most commonly found were Cladosporium cladosporioides (20.43%) and C. sphaerospermum (15.99%). Acremonium terricola, Monodictys castaneae, Penicillium glandicola, Phoma tropica and Tetraploa aristata are being reported for the first time as endophytic fungi for Brazil. The majority of isolated fungi exhibited enzymatic potential. Aspergillus japonicus and P. glandicola presented pectinolytic activity. Xylaria sp. was the most important among the other 14 species with positive cellulase activity. All 24 isolates analysed were xylanase-positive. Protease was best produced by isolate PF103.

"We investigated the diversity of endophytic fungi found on grape (Vitis labrusca cv. Niagara Rosada) leaves collected from Salesopolis, SP, Brazil. The fungi were isolated and characterized by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis, followed by sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA. In addition, the ability of these endophytic fungi to inhibit the grapevine pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp herbemontis was determined in vitro. We also observed that the climatic factors, such as temperature and rainfall, have no effect on the frequency of infection by endophytic fungi. The endophytic fungal community that was identified included Aporospora terricola, Aureobasidium pullulans, Bjerkandera adusta, Colletotrichum boninense, C. gloeosporioides, Diaporthe helianthi, D. phaseolorum, Epicoccum nigrum, Flavodon flavus, Fusarium subglutinans, F. sacchari, Guignardia mangiferae, Lenzites elegans, Paraphaeosphaeria pilleata, Phanerochaete sordida, Phyllosticta sp, Pleurotus nebrodensis, Preussia africana, Tinctoporellus epiniltinus, and Xylaria berteri. Among these isolates, two, C. gloeosporioides and F. flavus, showed potential antagonistic activity against F. oxysporum f. sp herbemontis. We suggest the involvement of the fungal endophyte community of V. labrusca in protecting the host plant against pathogenic Fusarium species. Possibly, some endophytic isolates could be selected for the development of biological control agents for grape fungal disease; alternatively, management strategies could be tailored to increase these beneficial fungi.","J","Brum, MCP; Araújo, WL; Maki, CS; Azevedo, JL",NA,"","","Brum, M.

"Endophytic fungi stimulate the production of an enormous number of bioactive metabolites in medicinal plants and affect the different steps of biosynthetic pathways of these secondary metabolites. Endophytic fungi possess a number of biosynthetic gene clusters that possess genes for various enzymes, transcription factors, etc., in their genome responsible for the production of secondary metabolites. Additionally, endophytic fungi also modulate the expression of various genes responsible for the synthesis of key enzymes involved in metabolic pathways of such as HMGR, DXR, etc. involved in the production of a large number of phenolic compounds as well as regulate the expression of genes involved in the production of alkaloids and terpenoids in different plants. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of gene expression related to endophytes and their impact on metabolic pathways. Additionally, this review will emphasize the studies done to isolate these secondary metabolites from endophytic fungi in large quantities and assess their bioactivity. Due to ease in synthesis of secondary metabolites and their huge application in the medical industry, these bioactive metabolites are now being extracted from strains of these endophytic fungi commercially. Apart from their application in the pharmaceutical industry, most of these metabolites extracted from endophytic fungi also possess plant growth-promoting ability, bioremediation potential, novel bio control agents, sources of anti-oxidants, etc. The review will comprehensively shed a light on the biotechnological application of these fungal metabolites at the industrial level.","J","Toppo, P; Kagatay, LL; Gurung, A; Singla, P; Chakraborty, R; Roy, S; Mathur, P",NA,"","","Toppo, Prabha; Kagatay, Lahasang Lamu; Gurung, Ankita; Singla, Priyanka; Chakraborty, Rakhi; Roy, Swarnendu; Mathur, Piyush",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi mediates production of bioactive secondary metabolites via modulation of genes involved in key metabolic pathways and their contribution in different biotechnological sector","3 BIOTECH","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Singla, Priyanka/G-1461-2015","Singla, Priyanka/0000-0002-4142-4614; Roy, Swarnendu/0000-0001-8239-6683; Chakraborty, Rakhi/0000-0002-3980-9961; Mathur, Piyush/0000-0002-4481-5506",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2190-572X","2190-5738","",NA,NA,"JUN",2023,13,"6",NA,"","",NA,"","","191","10.1007/s13205-023-03605-z","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-023-03605-z","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37197561,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000986487900001","View Full Record in Web of Science",632,"Review"
"The endophytic microbiome is thought to play an important role in promoting plant growth and health. Using culture-independent and culture-dependent protocols, this study characterized the seasonal shifts in the endophytic fungal microbiota of four mulberry (Morus L.) cultivars having different levels of resistance to mulberry fruit sclerotiniosis. Core endophytes can be obtained by two approaches, and they were divided into two clusters by season. Spring samples harbored higher operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and alpha-diversity, while autumn samples had more sequences or isolates of the fungal class Dothideomycetes with the representative orders Capnodiales and Pleosporales. While comparing different mulberry cultivars, we found that the total number of OTUs in susceptible cultivars was higher than that of resistant cultivars, and Cladosporium sp. were observed in all. Notably, the causal agent of fruit sclerotiniosis (Scleromitrula shiraiana) was only detected in susceptible cultivars. Collectively, our work elucidated significant variations in the mulberry endophytic microbiome, mainly because of seasonal shifts, and the fact that the host cultivars and mulberry endophytic fungal community appeared to have a certain connection with the resistance level of mulberry fruit to sclerotiniosis. These results provided valuable information on the isolation and culturing of mulberry endophytes that could be applied to improve mulberry fruit production and health.","J","Xu, WF; Wang, F; Wang, RL; Sui, Y; Zhou, ZY; Xie, J; Xiang, ZH",NA,"","","Xu, Weifang; Wang, Fei; Wang, Ruolin; Sui, Yuan; Zhou, Zeyang; Xie, Jie; Xiang, Zhonghuai",NA,NA,"Seasonal Characterization of the Endophytic Fungal Microbiome of Mulberry (Morus spp.) Cultivars Resistant and Susceptible to Sclerotiniosis","MICROORGANISMS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Xu, weifang/HNB-7798-2023","zhou, zeyang/0000-0003-2296-0742",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2076-2607","",NA,NA,"OCT",2021,9,"10",NA,"","",NA,"","","2052","10.3390/microorganisms9102052","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms9102052","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34683372,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000711880600001","View Full Record in Web of Science",633,"Presence"

"Root-associated endophytic fungi like Serendipita indica and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can improve plant growth and root con-struction, but the potential mechanism is unclear. In this study, Funneliformis mosseae (an AM fungus) and S. indica, singly or in combination were inoculated into trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata) seedlings, to assess changes in biomass and root morphological traits, coupled with auxins and cytokinins concentrations in leaves and roots and the expression of auxin synthesis and transporter protein genes. After 20 weeks of inoculation with these fungi, shoot and root biomass, root total length, taproot length, average diameter, surface area, volume, and the number of lateral roots in 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-order were improved, and S. indica showed a relatively greater effect than F. mosseae and dual inoculation. Endophytic fungal inoculation also significantly increased the concentration of indoleacetic acid, indole butyric acid, trans-zeatin, dihydrozeatin, and isopentenyl adenine in leaves and roots, whilst F. mosseae and S. indica exhibited relatively greater effects on leaves and roots, respectively. Correlation analysis revealed that both biomass and root morphological traits (except root projected area) were significantly positively associated with endogenous auxins and cytokinins. In addition, the inoculated plants recorded comparatively higher expression levels of indoleacetic acid synthesis genes (PtTAA1, PtTAR2, PtYUC3, PtYUC4, PtYUC6, and PtYUC8) and indoleacetic acid transporter protein genes (PtAUX1, PtLAX1, PtLAX2, PtLAX3, PtPIN1, PtPIN3, PtPIN4, PtABCB1, and PtABCB19) than the non-inoculated plants, among which F. mosseae and S. indica showed better effects in leaves and roots, respectively.

"The common (or English) walnut (Juglans regia L.) is an economically important hardwood tree species cultivated worldwide for its edible nuts and high-quality wood. However, walnut trees are attacked by many pathogens causing economic damage. Among these pathogens, the most important fungal disease agent of walnut is Ophiognomonia leptostyla (Fr.) Sogonov (formerly Gnomonia leptostyla (Fr.) Ces. et de Not), which causes walnut anthracnose. In this study, endophytic fungi from various walnuts tissues (leaves, roots, twigs, shoots, fruits, and petioles) were isolated and molecularly identified by ITS gene sequencing. Additionally, the isolated fungi were tested for their in vitro antagonistic potential against O. leptostyla. A total of 35 endophytic fungi were isolated and species richness of endophytic fungi in roots was found to be higher than in aboveground organs. The most frequently isolated species was Fusarium sp. Seven isolates (Alternaria sp. CC-3, A. chlamydosporigena CC-8 and CC-9, Fusarium acuminatum CC-11, unidentified CC-16, Neonectria sp. CC-22 and unidentified CC-44) showed the antagonistic effects on O. leptostyla at different rates and the highest inhibition rate was obtained from Alternaria sp. CC-3 with 52.5%. Also, the presence of polyketide synthase I-II and non-ribosomal peptide synthase genes (possible antifungal-related genes) was investigated by PCR. From seven isolates showing antagonistic activity, PKS-I gene was detected in 3 isolates (Alternaria sp. CC-3, A. chlamydosporigena CC-8 and CC-9), PKS-II in one isolate (F. acuminatum CC-11), NRPS in two isolates (unidentified CC-16 and Neonectria sp. CC-22). None of three genes was detected in one isolate (unidentified CC-44). This is the first study to determine the antagonistic activity of the endophytic fungi isolated from walnuts against O. leptostyla. It is thought that the results will be beneficial in the future biological control programs for walnut anthracnose disease.","J","Yabaneri, C; Sevim, A",NA,"","","Yabaneri, Cafer; Sevim, Ali",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi from the common walnut and their in vitro antagonistic activity against Ophiognomonia leptostyla","BIOLOGIA","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0006-3088","1336-9563","",NA,NA,"FEB",2023,78,"2",NA,"","",NA,"361","371","","10.1007/s11756-022-01218-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11756-022-01218-0","","OCT 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000876109400001","View Full Record in Web of Science",639,"Presence"

"Aims: To isolate, characterize and determine the antibacterial activities of compounds produced by the endophytic fungus Diaporthe sp. F2934, cultivated on malt extract agar. Methods and Results: The fungus was cultivated aseptically in Petri dishes containing malt extract agar at 25 degrees C for 15 days. Crude extract was obtained from mycelium using ethyl acetate and sonication, and was fractioned using classic chromatography and HPLC. The structures of phomosines and chromanones were established by NMR experiments including HMQC, HMBC and COSY. Their molecular formulas were determined by ESI-TOFMS. We obtained six compounds: (1) 4H-1-benzopyra-4-one-2,3-dihydro-5-hydroxy-2,8-dimetyl, (2) 4H-1-benzopyran-4-one-2,3-dihydro-5-hydroxy-8-(hydroxy-lmethyl)-2-methyl, (3) 4H-1-benzopyra-4-one-2,3-dihydro-5-methoxyl-2,8-dimetyl, (4) phomosine A, (5) phomosine D and (6) phomosine C. Isolated compounds 1, 2 and 5 were inactive against 15 micro-organisms, but phomosines A and C were active against diverse Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Conclusions: A group of new chromanones and known phomosines have been isolated from the genus Diaporthe (Diaporthe sp. F2934). The results obtained confirm the wide chemical diversity produced by endophytic fungi, specifically the genus Diaporthe. In addition, phomosines A and C may be considered as antimicrobial agents that can be used to guide the development of new antibiotics. Significance and Impact of the Study: Our phylogenetic analysis places Diaporthe sp. F2934 as sister to the Diaporthe cynaroidis clade. Three chromanones were isolated and identified, for the first time, using crude extract obtained from Diaporthe F2934. From this extract phomosines A, C and D were also purified. Regarding Staphylococcus aureus, the inhibition zone diameter (IZD) for phomosine A was 20% higher than the standard drug, vancomycin. When cultivated as described here, Diaporthe sp. F2934 produced new and antimicrobial compounds.","J","Sousa, JPB; Aguilar-Pérez, MM; Arnold, AE; Rios, N; Coley, PD; Kursar, TA; Cubilla-Rios, L",NA,"","","Sousa, J. P. B.; Aguilar-Perez, M.

The results illustrated that three endophytic fungal strains were isolated and identified morphologically and genetically as Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Aspergillus flavus and deposited in gene bank under accession numbers MZ045561, MZ045562, and MZ045563 respectively. Moreover, cell-free filtrates of endophytic fungal strains were extracted using ethyl acetate, where these crude extracts exhibited promising antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Candida albicans at a concentration of 1000 mu g/mL. Furthermore, these endophytic strains exhibited a potential antioxidant activity where IC50 of the crude extract of A. nidulans, A. fumigatus, and A. flavus were (166.3, 68.4, and 347.1 mu g/mL) and (151.2, 77.9, and 246.3 mu g/mL) using DPPH and ABTS methods, respectively. Furthermore, the ethyl acetate crude extracts of these endophytic fungi did not exhibit any cytotoxic effect against Vero and Wi 38 normal cells. GC-MS analysis of the crude extract of A. nidulans, A. fumigatus, and A. flavus indicated the presence of 22, 22, and 20 active compounds, respectively. The major compounds in the fungal extracts are belonging to fatty acids, fatty acid esters, tetrahydrofurans, and sterols. In conclusion, the isolated endophytic A. nidulans, A. fumigatus, and A. flavus from Ocimum basilicum are promising sources for bioactive compounds.","J","Sharaf, MH; Abdelaziz, AM; Kalaba, MH; Radwan, AA; Hashem, AH",NA,"","","Sharaf, Mohamed H.; Abdelaziz, Amer M.; Kalaba, Mohamed H.; Radwan, Ahmed A.; Hashem, Amr H.",NA,NA,"Antimicrobial, Antioxidant, Cytotoxic Activities and Phytochemical Analysis of Fungal Endophytes Isolated from Ocimum Basilicum","APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hashem, Amr Hosny/ABD-3475-2020; Sharaf, Mohamed/HDO-3658-2022; kalaba, Mohamed H./HDM-8913-2022; Abdelaziz, Amer/GOJ-8888-2022","Hashem, Amr Hosny/0000-0002-0024-3606; Sharaf, Mohamed/0000-0002-1254-6831; kalaba, Mohamed H./0000-0002-1984-8103; Abdelaziz, Amer/0000-0003-2410-5168; Radwan, Ahmed A/0000-0002-0483-4059",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0273-2289","1559-0291","",NA,NA,"MAR",2022,194,"3",NA,"","SI",NA,"1271","1289","","10.1007/s12010-021-03702-w","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12010-021-03702-w","","OCT 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34661866,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000708398300004","View Full Record in Web of Science",642,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi are now recognized as an excellent source of widely occurring natural products. Fungi are wonderful producers of natural products, mostly secondary metabolites. The vital use of these fungi may provide benefit to current demand for novel biomolecules in agriculture, medical and pharmaceutical industries. In this study, endophytic fungi Aspergillus terreus, Cephalosporium sp., Chaetomium sp., Curvularia lunata, Curvularia hawaiiensis, Macrophomina phaseolina, Fusarium solani, Talaromyces assiutensis and Talaromyces trachyspermus isolated from healthy plants and evaluated for nematicidal activity against Meloidogyne javanica, a root-knot nematode. In vitro culture filtrates of these fungi showed strong nematicidal activity by killing juveniles of nematode to varying degree, where F.solani caused 100% mortality after 48 hours. n-Hexane fraction of culture filtrate and n-hexane extract of mycelium of F. solani were subjected to GC-MS analysis, resulted in the identification of several compounds and some are not reported before from this fungus. Metabolites from endophytic F. solani could be used in the development of antimicrobial agents that can be used in medicine or agrochemicals. The use of fungal based products offers a unique opportunity to discover novel therapeutic agents to combat various infectious agents and agricultural pests. (c) 2021 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"To explore the biogeographical patterns of endophytic fungal communities on a large scale, we surveyed fungal endophytes in roots of Stipa krylovii from six vegetation types in grassland along a 3200 km west-east transect in northern China. Pyrosequencing of samples collected from 18 sites (three sites per vegetation type) revealed that Pleosporales, Hypocreales, Agaricales, and Xylariales were the dominant fungal orders in roots of S. krylovii. The dominant genera were Marasmius, Fusarium, Acremonium, Sarcinomyces, and Monosporascus, and these genera were distributed differently among the six vegetation types. In a variation partitioning analysis, vegetation type, geographical distance, and environmental parameters (mean annual precipitation and air temperature, soil organic carbon, soil total nitrogen, pH, elevation) explained 98.2% of variation in the endophyte fungal community, and environmental parameters explained more variation than did vegetation type or geographical distance. Mean annual precipitation was the major significant factor influencing endophytic fungal communities. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

"Endophytic fungi have been recognized as prolific producers of chemically diverse secondary metabolites. In this work, we describe a new representative of the order Helotiales isolated from the medicinal plant Bergenia pacumbis. Several bioactive secondary metabolites were produced by this Helotiales sp. BL 73 isolate grown on rice medium, including cochlioquinones and isofusidienols. Sequencing and analysis of the approximately 59-Mb genome revealed at least 77 secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters, of which several could be associated with detected compounds or linked to previously reported molecules. Four terpene synthase genes identified in the BL73 genome were codon optimized and expressed, together with farnesyl-, geranyl-, and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate synthases, in Streptomyces spp. An analysis of recombinant strains revealed the production of linalool and its oxidized form, terpenoids typically associated with plants, as well as a yet unidentified terpenoid. This study demonstrates the importance of a complex approach to the investigation of the biosynthetic potential of endophytic fungi using both conventional methods and genome mining. IMPORTANCE Endophytic fungi represent an as yet underexplored source of secondary metabolites, of which some may have industrial and medical applications. We isolated a slow-growing fungus belonging to the order Helotiales from the traditional medicinal plant Bergenia pacumbis and characterized its potential to biosynthesize secondary metabolites. We used cultivation of the isolate with a subsequent analysis of compounds produced, bioinformatics-based mining of the genome, and heterologous expression of several terpene synthase genes. Our study revealed that this Helotiales isolate has enormous potential to produce structurally diverse natural products, including polyketides, nonribosomally synthesized peptides, terpenoids, and ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptides (RiPP5). Identification of meroterpenoids and xanthones, along with establishing a link between these molecules and their putative biosynthetic genes, sets the stage for investigation of the respective biosynthetic pathways. The heterologous production of terpenoids suggests that this approach can be used for the discovery of new compounds belonging to this chemical class using Streptomyces bacteria as hosts.","J","Oberhofer, M; Malfent, F; Zehl, M; Urban, E; Wackerlig, J; Reznicek, G; Vignolle, GA; Rückert, C; Busche, T; Wibberg, D; Zotchev, SB",NA,"","","Oberhofer, Martina; Malfent, Fabian; Zehl, Martin; Urban, Ernst; Wackerlig, Judith; Reznicek, Gottfried; Vignolle, Gabriel A.; Rueckert, Christian; Busche, Tobias; Wibberg, Daniel; Zotchev, Sergey B.",NA,NA,"Biosynthetic Potential of the Endophytic Fungus Helotiales sp.

"Research on the active components of medicinal plants has always been the focus of research, and research on the active components of medicinal plant endophytic fungi and their secondary metabolites has also attracted widespread attention. Endophytic fungi of medicinal plants are widely distributed and are ubiquitous in various biological groups in nature. Rehmannia glutinosa contains a variety of active ingredients, which are regarded as the top grade of Chinese medicinal materials. It is of certain significance to study endophytic fungi and their metabolites of Rehmannia glutinosa. In this paper, endophytic fungi and their secondary metabolites of Rehmannia glutinosa were studied using fingerprint technology, which initially understands the diversity of endophytic fungi in Rehmannia glutinosa. In this paper, the roots and leaves of Rehmannia glutinosa were used as experimental materials. The fungi were cultured in the medium, the fungi were isolated and purified by the tissue block method, the fungal growth of Rehmannia glutinosa in different parts was determined, and the types of endophytic fungi were identified by microscopic identification and fingerprinting. The isolated strains were tested for biological activity using oryza oryzae spores, and highly active strains were screened. Fermentation products of endophytic fungi were separated and purified by chromatography, and the structure of the compounds was identified by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Through the above studies, the population structure of endophytic fungi of Rehmannia glutinosa was determined, 3 highly active strains were found, and the structures of 7 endophytic fungi metabolites were identified, of which 3 were newly discovered compounds.","J","Geng, XT",NA,"","","Geng, Xiaotong",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungi and Secondary Metabolites of Rehmannia Glutinosa Based on Traditional Chinese Medicine Fingerprints","CONTRAST MEDIA & MOLECULAR IMAGING","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1555-4309","1555-4317","",NA,NA,"AUG 30",2022,2022,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","7701198","10.1155/2022/7701198","http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2022/7701198","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36110979,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000884316500007","View Full Record in Web of Science",648,"Presence"
"As an important resource for screening microbial strains capable of conferring stress tolerance in plants, the fungal community associated with the plants grown in stressful environments has received great attention. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was employed to study the rhizosphere fungal community in the reclaimed area (i.e., sites F, H, and T) of the eastern coast of China. Moreover, endophytic fungi from the root of six plant species colonizing the investigated sites were isolated and identified. The differences in soil physicochemical parameters, fungal diversity, and community structure were detected among the sampling sites and between the seasons. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi (e.g., genera Tuber and Geopora) were dominant at site F, which was characterized by high soil total carbon (SC) and total nitrogen (SN) contents and low soil electrical conductivity (EC) value. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, including genera Glomus, Rhizophagus, and Entrophospora were dominant at sites H (winter), H (summer), and T (summer), respectively. The positive relationship between the EC value and the abundance of genus Glomus indicated the ability of this AM fungus to protect plants against the salt stress. Endophytic fungi at sites F (Aspergillus and Tetracladium), H (Nigrospora), and T (Nigrospora, Coniochaeta and Zopfiella) were recognized as the biomarkers or keystone taxa, among which only genus Aspergillus was isolated from the plant roots. The aforementioned AM fungi and endophytic fungi could contribute to the promotion of plant growth in the newly reclaimed land.","J","Zhong, F; Fan, XL; Ji, WH; Hai, ZX; Hu, NC; Li, XT; Liu, GY; Yu, CM; Chen, YH; Lian, BL; Wei, H; Zhang, J",NA,"","","Zhong, Fei; Fan, Xinlei; Ji, Wenhui; Hai, Zhixing; Hu, Naican; Li, Xintong; Liu, Guoyuan; Yu, Chunmei; Chen, Yanhong; Lian, Bolin; Wei, Hui; Zhang, Jian",NA,NA,"Soil Fungal Community Composition and Diversity of Culturable Endophytic Fungi from Plant Roots in the Reclaimed Area of the Eastern Coast of China","JOURNAL OF FUNGI","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Fan, Xinlei/AAE-1835-2022","Fan, Xinlei/0000-0002-4946-4442; Zhong, Fei/0000-0003-3313-0904",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2309-608X","",NA,NA,"FEB",2022,8,"2",NA,"","",NA,"","","124","10.3390/jof8020124","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof8020124","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35205878,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000767503500001","View Full Record in Web of Science",649,"Presence"
"Heritiera fomes Buch.-Ham., a mangrove plant from the Sundarbans, has adapted to a unique habitat, muddy saline water, anaerobic soil, brackish tidal activities, and high microbial competition. Endophytic fungal association protects this plant from adverse environmental conditions.

"Fungal endophytes have been found to exist in many plant species and appear to be important to their plant hosts. However, the diversity and biological activities of these fungi remain largely unknown. Zanthoxylum simulans Hance, a popular natural spice and medicinal plant, commonly known as Szechuan pepper or Chinese-pepper, grows on Kinmen Island, Taiwan. In this study, leaf and stem samples of Z. simulans, collected in summer and winter, were screened for antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory metabolite-producing endophytic fungi. A total of 113 endophytic strains were isolated and cultured from Z. simulans, among which 23 were found to possess antimicrobial activity, belonging to six fungal genera: Penicillium (26.09%, 6), Colletotrichum (21.74%, 5), Diaporthe (21.74%, 5), Daldinia (17.39%, 4), Alternaria (8.70%, 2), and Didymella (4.34%, 1). We also found that the number of species with antimicrobial activity and their compositions differed between summer and winter. Our study demonstrated that Z. simulans might contain large and diverse communities of endophytic fungi, and its community composition varies seasonally. In addition, fungal endophytes produce antimicrobial agents, which may protect their hosts against pathogens and could be a potential source of natural antibiotics.","J","Kuo, J; Chan, CF; Chi, WC",NA,"","","Kuo, Jimmy; Chan, Chin-Feng; Chi, Wei-Chiung",NA,NA,"Isolation of endophytic fungi with antimicrobial activity from medicinal plant Zanthoxylum simulans Hance","FOLIA MICROBIOLOGICA","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Chi, Wei-Chiung/0000-0001-9297-0917",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0015-5632","1874-9356","",NA,NA,"JUN",2021,66,"3",NA,"","",NA,"385","397","","10.1007/s12223-021-00854-4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12223-021-00854-4","","FEB 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33544301,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000615161400001","View Full Record in Web of Science",651,"Presence"
"Background: Establishing the contribution of host plant genotype to the assembly of root-associated microbial communities can be challenging, since multiple ecological factors may confound the effects purely due to the host, and plant species often do not occur sympatrically.Aims: We aimed to measure the relative importance of host plant species on driving the assembly of natural root-endophytic fungal communities, as compared to other habitat conditions that depend on the local environment.Methods: Species of annual wild Brassicaceae and the cultivated Brassica napus were collected in two separate locations, where they grew in close proximity. Arrhentherum elatius (Poaceae) was also collected in both sites and used as outgroup. The root-endophytic fungal communities of these plants were characterised using Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing and cultivation, and compared between locations and hosts.Results: Plant family and sampling location were the factors driving most variation in fungal communities, affecting both community composition and the proportion of cultivable fungi. Whether Brassicaceae were wild or domesticated had little effect on endophytic communities, although its contribution increased when cultivable fungi were considered. No strong specificity of endophytes towards hosts was found, because a core mycobiome was shared by different species.Conclusions: Plant species is a limited predictor of the structure and composition of fungal endophytic communities in roots of annual Brassicaceae, as compared to geographic location. However, the host effect on endophytic assemblages increases with phylogenetic distance between hosts.","J","Glynou, K; Thines, M; Maciá-Vicente, JG",NA,"","","Glynou, Kyriaki; Thines, Marco; Macia-Vicente, Jose G.",NA,NA,"Host species identity in annual Brassicaceae has a limited effect on the assembly of root-endophytic fungal communities","PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Macia-Vicente, Jose Gaspar/I-5665-2019","Macia-Vicente, Jose Gaspar/0000-0002-7174-7270",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1755-0874","1755-1668","",NA,NA,"NOV 2",2018,11,"5-6",NA,"","SI",NA,"569","580","","10.1080/17550874.2018.1504332","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17550874.2018.1504332","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000471941900003","View Full Record in Web of Science",652,"Presence"
"Endophytes contribute to the synthesis of significant metabolites in symbiotic association with their host plants. On considering the medicinal importance of the prominent tree species Pajanelia longifolia (WilId.) K. Schuman, the study was conducted to isolate and identify the endophytic bacteria and fungi for their bioactivity. The isolation of endophytic bacteria and fungi were performed by surface sterilisation of the stem and leaf samples of P. longifolia. The obtained bacterial and fungal endophytic isolates were maintained in nutrient agar and Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) media and were examined for colony morphology and microscopic appearances with varied biochemical characterisations. Furthermore, both the fungal and bacterial isolates were subjected to solvent extractions to evaluate antibacterial activity. Also, anti-proliferative effects due to apoptotic induction by the endophytic fungal extracts were checked against proliferative yeast cells. Moreover, endophytic bacteria belonging to Enterococcaceae had shown antibacterial activity against Salmonella species. In the present study, fungal species belonging to Cladosporium predominantly found to inhabit as endophytic fungi in the plant samples. Also, this particular fungus among other selected endophytic fungi attributed to causing effective anti-proliferative activity. The endophytic bacteria belonging to Enterococcus and Micrococcus genera showed significant antimicrobial activity against Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 23564).","J","Gowthami, GA; Das, S; Karthik, Y; Kalyani, MI",NA,"","","Gowthami, G.

"Understanding the effects of root-associated microbes in explaining plant community patterns represents a challenge in community ecology. Although typically overlooked, several lines of evidence point out that nonmycorrhizal, root endophytic fungi in the Ascomycota may have the potential to drive changes in plant community ecology given their ubiquitous presence, wide host ranges, and plant species-specific fitness effects. Thus, we experimentally manipulated the presence of root endophytic fungal species in microcosms and measured its effects on plant communities. Specifically, we tested whether (1) three different root endophyte species can modify plant community structure; (2) those changes can also modified the way plant respond to different soil types; and (3) the effects are modified when all the fungi are present. As a model system, we used plant and fungal species that naturally co-occur in a temperate grassland. Further, the soil types used in our experiment reflected a strong gradient in soil texture that has been shown to drive changes in plant and fungal community structure in the field. Results showed that each plant species responded differently to infection, resulting in distinct patterns of plant community structure depending on the identity of the fungus present. Those effects depended on the soil type. For example, large positive effects due to presence of the fungi were able to compensate for less nutrients levels in one soil type. Further, host responses when all three fungi were present were different from the ones observed in single fungal inoculations, suggesting that endophyte-endophyte interactions may be important in structuring plant communities. Overall, these results indicate that plant responses to changes in the species identity of nonmycorrhizal fungal community species and their interactions can modify plant community structure.","J","Aguilar-Trigueros, CA; Rillig, MC",NA,"","","Aguilar-Trigueros, Carlos A.; Rillig, Matthias C.",NA,NA,"Effect of different root endophytic fungi on plant community structure in experimental microcosms","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rillig, Matthias C./AAE-6980-2019; Rillig, Matthias C./B-3675-2009; Aguilar, Carlos/AAZ-6531-2021","Rillig, Matthias C./0000-0003-3541-7853; Rillig, Matthias C./0000-0003-3541-7853; Aguilar-Trigueros, Carlos A/0000-0003-0512-9500",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2045-7758","","",NA,NA,"NOV",2016,6,"22",NA,"","",NA,"8149","8158","","10.1002/ece3.2416","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.2416","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27878084,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000387664500020","View Full Record in Web of Science",658,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi have bioactive compounds in the form of secondary metabolites that come from reciprocal relationships with their host plants.

"This research was designed to screen for strains that produce microbial oil by using straw as the substrate. One hundred and forty-one isolates of endophytic fungi were obtained from stems of seven oleaginous plant species. Sixty-nine isolates (48.9% of the total isolates) could be clearly seen having lipid bodies in their hyphae when examined with optical microscopy. Twenty-six isolates which had bigger and more oil bodies in their hyphae were selected for further research. These isolates belong to five genera including Microsphaeropsis, Phomopsis, Cephalosporium, Sclerocystis and Nigrospora. Their oil contents ranged from 21.3 to 35.0% of dry cell weights when cultured in potato dextrose broth. When cultured on the solid-state medium composed of steam-exploded wheat straw (20% w/w), wheat bran (5%) and water (75%) they were able to produce cellulase and microbial oil with yields of 0.31 similar to 0.69 filter paper unit and 19 similar to 42 mg/g initial dry substrate, respectively.

"Nitrogen (N) is a crucial nutrient for soil biota, and its cycling is determined by the organic carbon decomposing process. Some endophytic fungi are latent saprotrophs that trigger their saprotrophic metabolism to promote litter organic matter cycling as soon as the host tissue senesces or dies. However, the effects of endophytic fungi on litter and soil N dynamics in vitro have rarely been investigated. In this study, we investigated N dynamics (total and mineral N) in both litter and soil in incubations of a pure culture of an endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambari with litter and following soil burial of the litter. Soil enzymes and microbial communities participating in the N transformations were also investigated. A pure culture of P. liquidambari released litter NH (4) (+) -N in the initial stages (10 days) of the incubation. However, following soil burial, the presence of both P. liquidambari and soil ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) resulted in an increase in soil NO (3) (-) -N. These results indicate that the endophytic fungus P. liquidambari in vitro stimulates organic mineralization and promote NH (4) (+) -N release.

"Endophytic fungi are capable of producing a great diversity of bioactive metabolites. However, the presence of silent and lowly expressed genes represents a main challenge for the discovery of novel secondary metabolites with different potential uses. Epigenetic modifiers have shown to perturb the production of fungal metabolites through the induction of silent biosynthetic pathways leading to an enhanced chemical diversity. Moreover, the addition of bioprecursors to the culture medium has been described as a useful strategy to induce specific biosynthetic pathways. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of different chemical modulators on the metabolic profiles of an endophytic fungal strain of Cophinforma mamane (Botryosphaeriaceae), known to produce 3 thiodiketopiperazine (TDKP) alkaloids (botryosulfuranols A-C), previously isolated and characterized by our team. Four epigenetic modifiers, 5-azacytidine (AZA), sodium butyrate (SB), nicotinamide (NIC), homoserine lactone (HSL) as well as 2 amino acids, L-phenylalanine and L-tryptophan, as bioprecursors of TDKPs, were used. The metabolic profiles were analysed by UHPLC-HRMS/MS under an untargeted metabolomics approach. Our results show that the addition of the two amino acids in C. mamane culture and the treatment with AZA significantly reduced the production of the TDKPs botryosulfuranols A, B and C. Interestingly, the treatment with HSL significantly induced the production of different classes of diketopiperazines (DKPs). The treatment with AZA resulted as the most effective epigenetic modifier for the alteration of the secondary metabolite profile of C. mamane by promoting the expression of cryptic genes.(c) 2022 British Mycological Society.

"Plants have a diverse endophytic microbiome that is functionally important for their growth, development, and health. In this study, the diversity and specificity of culturable endophytic fungal communities were explored in one of the most important biofuel crops, switchgrass plants (Panicum virgatum L.), which have been cultivated on a reclaimed coal-mining site for more than 20 years. The endophytic fungi were isolated from the surface-sterilized shoot (leaf and stem), root, and seed tissues of switchgrass plants and then cultured for identification. A total of 1339 fungal isolates were found and 22 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were sequence identified by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers and grouped into 7 orders and 4 classes. Although a diverse range of endophytic fungi associated with switchgrass were documented, the most abundant class, order, and species were Sordariomycetes, Hypocreales, and Fusarium spp. respectively. About 86% of the isolated endophytic fungi were able to enhance the heights of the shoots; 69% could increase the shoot fresh weights; and 62% could improve the shoot dry weights after being reintroduced back into the switchgrass plants, which illustrated their functional importance. Through the Shannon Diversity Index analysis, we observed a gradation of species diversity, with shoots and roots having the similar values and seeds having a lesser value. It was observed that the switchgrass plants showing better growth performance displayed higher endophytic fungal species diversity and abundance. It was also discovered that the rhizosphere soil organic matter content was positively correlated with the fungal species diversity. All these data demonstrate the functional association of these beneficial endophytic fungi with switchgrass and their great potential in improving the switchgrass growth and biomass to benefit the biofuel industry by reducing chemical inputs and burden to the environment.","J","Xia, Y; Amna, A; Opiyo, SO",NA,"","","Xia, Ye; Amna, Amna; Opiyo, Stephen Obol",NA,NA,"The culturable endophytic fungal communities of switchgrass grown on a coal-mining site and their effects on plant growth","PLOS ONE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Xia, Ye/B-8217-2016","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1932-6203","","",NA,NA,"JUN 14",2018,13,"6",NA,"","",NA,"","","e0198994","10.1371/journal.pone.0198994","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198994","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29902231,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000435424900071","View Full Record in Web of Science",664,"Presence"
"Eighteen species of endophytic fungi were isolated from bark, stem and leaf segments of five medicinal plant species growing within the Kudremukh range in the Western Ghats of India. The dominant endophytic fungal species isolated from these plant species were Curvularia clavata, C. lunata, C. pallescens and Fusarium oxysporum. The highest species richness as well as frequency of colonization of endophytic fungi was found in the leaf segments, rather than the stem and bark segments, of the host plant species. The greatest number of endophytic fungal species were found within Callicarpa tomentosa (11 species), whereas Lobelia nicotinifolia harbored the lowest number of fungal endophytes (5 species). This study provides evidence that fungal endophytes are host and tissue specific.","J","Raviraja, NS",NA,"","","Raviraja, NS",NA,NA,"Fungal endophytes in five medicinal plant species from Kudremukh Range, Western Ghats of India","JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0233-111X","1521-4028","",NA,NA,"",2005,45,"3",NA,"","",NA,"230","235","","10.1002/jobm.200410514","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.200410514","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,15900544,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000229755500007","View Full Record in Web of Science",665,"Presence"
"The endophytic fungus, Beauveria bassiana has been found to occur endophytically in hundreds of plant species tissues and has been inoculated for establishment in different plants. It has negative effect on piercing-sucking insects in grapevine plants. Thus, the present study aimed to detect the endophytic fungus, B. bassiana throughout ITS genes analysis in the grapevine plant, Vitis venifera cv. Taify and assess its potential for controlling the grapevine aphid, Aphis illinoisensis Shimer (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The obtained 5 isolates were DNA sequenced for ITS region. Data analysis showed that there were 2 different isolates (accession number: MN900613 for isolate Bb-Taif1 and MN900614 for isolate Bb-Taif2). The values of LC50 were 6.041 x 10(4), 3.199 x 10(5) spores/ml while those of LC90 were 6.13 x 10(6) and 7.474 x 10(7) spores/ml after 3 days of treatment by Bb-Taif1 and Bb-Taif2, respectively. These values showed that the virulence of Bb-Taif1 isolate was higher in its efficacy than the Bb-Taif2 isolate. Further investigations are needed to evaluate its efficacy on other piercing sucking or chewing insect pests throughout conidia spraying, soil inoculation, and/or root immersion for grapevine plants.","J","Sayed, S; El-Shehawi, A; Al-Otaibi, S; El-Shazly, S; Al-Otaibi, S; Ibrahim, R; Alorabi, M; Baazeem, A; Elseehy, M",NA,"","","Sayed, Samy; El-Shehawi, Ahmed; Al-Otaibi, Saad; El-Shazly, Samir; Al-Otaibi, Saqer; Ibrahim, Reda; Alorabi, Mohammed; Baazeem, Alaa; Elseehy, Mona",NA,NA,"Isolation and efficacy of the endophytic fungus, Beauveria bassiana (Bals.)

"Chemical investigation of the mycelium of Edenia gomezpompae, a newly discovered endophytic fungus isolated from the leaves of Callicarpa acuminata (Verbenaceac) collected from the ecological reserve El Eden, Quintana Roo, Mexico, resulted in the isolation of four naphthoquinone spiroketals, including three new compounds and palmarumycin CP2 (4). We elucidated the structures of the metabolites by extensive NMR spectroscopy studies, including DEPT, COSY, NOESY, HSQC, HMBC, and chiroptical methods. The trivial names proposed for these compounds are preussornerin EG(1) (1), preussornerin EG(2) (2) and preussomerin EG(3) (3). In addition, the X-ray data for 4 were obtained. The bioactivity of the mycelial organic extracts and the pure compounds was tested against three endophytic fungi (Colletotrichum sp., Phomopsis sp., and Guignardia manguifera) isolated from the same plant species (C acuminata, Verbenaceae) and against four economically important phytopathogenic microorganisms (two fungoid oomycetes, Phythophtora capsici and Phythophtora parasitica, and the fungi Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria solani). Spiroketals 1-3 displayed significant growth inhibition against all the phytopathogens. IC50 values for the four phytopathogens were from 20 to 170 mu g/ml. Palmarumycin CP2 (4) was not bioactive against any of the fungi tested. Compound I showed the strongest bioactivity. The acetylated derivatives of preussornerin EG, (1), la and 1b, were obtained and their biological activity was tested on endophytes and phytopathogens. Preussomerin EG(1) 1, la and 1b exhibited significant bioactivity against all microorganisms tested with the exception of Alternaria solani.

"BACKGROUND Endophytic fungi, present mainly in the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla, are associated with different plants and represent important producers of bioactive natural products. Brazil has a rich biodiversity of plant species, including those reported as being endemic. Among the endemic Brazilian plant species, Vellozia gigantea (Velloziaceae) is threatened by extinction and is a promising target to recover endophytic fungi. OBJECTIVE The present study focused on bioprospecting of bioactive compounds of the endophytic fungi associated with V. gigantea, an endemic, ancient, and endangered plant species that occurs only in the rupestrian grasslands of Brazil. METHODS The capability of 285 fungal isolates to produce antimicrobial and antimalarial activities was examined. Fungi were grown at solid-state fermentation to recover their crude extracts in dichloromethane. Bioactive extracts were analysed by chromatographic fractionation and NMR and displayed compounds with antimicrobial, antimycobacterial, and antimalarial activities. FINDINGS Five fungi produced antimicrobial and antimalarial compounds. Extracts of Diaporthe miriciae showed antifungal, antibacterial, and antimalarial activities; Trichoderma effusum displayed selective antibacterial activity against methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium intracellulare; and three Penicillium species showed antibacterial activity. D. miriciae extract contained highly functionalised secondary metabolites, yielding the compound epoxycytochalasin H with high antimalarial activity against the chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum, with an IC50 approximately 3.5-fold lower than that with chloroquine. MAIN CONCLUSION Our results indicate that V. gigantea may represent a microhabitat repository hotspot of potential fungi producers of bioactive compounds and suggest that endophytic fungal communities might be an important biological component contributing to the fitness of the plants living in the rupestrian grassland.","J","Ferreira, MC; Cantrell, CL; Wedge, DE; Gonçalves, VN; Jacob, MR; Khan, S; Rosa, CA; Rosa, LH",NA,"","","Ferreira, Mariana C.; Cantrell, Charles L.; Wedge, David E.; Goncalves, Vivian N.; Jacob, Melissa R.; Khan, Shabana; Rosa, Carlos A.; Rosa, Luiz H.",NA,NA,"Antimycobacterial and antimalarial activities of endophytic fungi associated with the ancient and narrowly endemic neotropical plant Vellozia gigantea from Brazil","MEMORIAS DO INSTITUTO OSWALDO CRUZ","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Khan, Ikhlas/AAA-1829-2020","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0074-0276","1678-8060","",NA,NA,"OCT",2017,112,"10",NA,"","",NA,"692","697","","10.1590/0074-02760170144","http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/0074-02760170144","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28953997,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000411575900006","View Full Record in Web of Science",668,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi are known to be a rich source for anti-infective drugs. In this study, Aptenia cordifolia associated endophytic fungi were explored for the first time. Seven isolates were identified morphologically followed by screening of these fungi by plug diffusion assay which revealed their potential activity against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 9144), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 14579), Serratia marcescens (ATCC 14756), Fusarium oxysporum (ATCC 48112), and Aspergillus flavus (ATCC 22546). Additionally, the crude ethyl acetate extract of the most potent three isolates in plug diffusion assay showed that Aspergillus sp. ACEFR2 was the most potent as anti-infective in disc diffusion assay; Accordingly, Aspergillus sp. ACEFR2 was investigated using phylogenetic analysis and LC-HR-ESI-MS. The phylogenetic analysis placed the strain into the Aspergillus section Niger close related to few species including A. niger. Whereas the metabolomic profiling revealed the presence of diverse pool of metabolites. Furthermore, in silico molecular docking study was carried out to predict which compounds most likely responsible for the anti-infective activity.","J","Yousef, MM; Abdelhafez, OH; Alsenani, F; Al Mouslem, AK; Hisham, M; El Zawily, A; Glaeser, SP; Kämpfer, P; Abdelmohsen, UR; El-Katatnye, MH",NA,"","","Yousef, Miram Magdy; Abdelhafez, Omnia Hesham; Alsenani, Faisl; Al Mouslem, Abdulaziz K.

"Locoweed is a perennial herbaceous plant included in Astragalus spp. and Oxytropis spp. that contains the toxic indolizidine alkaloid swainsonine. The livestock that consume locoweed can suffer from a type of toxicity called locoism. There are aliphaticnitro compounds, selenium, selenium compounds, and alkaloids in locoweed. The toxic component in locoweed has been identified as swainsonine, an indolizidine alkaloid. Swainsonine inhibits lysosomal a-mannosidase and mannosidase II, resulting in altered oligosaccharide degradation and incomplete glycoprotein processing. Corresponding studies on endophytic fungi producing swainsonine have been isolated from a variety of locoweed, and these endophytic fungi and locoweed have a close relationship. Endophytic fungi can promote the growth of locoweed and increase swainsonine production. As a result, livestock that consume locoweed exhibit several symptoms, including dispirited behavior, staggering gait, chromatopsia, trembling, ataxia, and cellular vacuolar degeneration of most tissues by pathological observation. Locoism results in significant annual economic losses. Therefore, in this paper, we review the current research on locoweed, including that on locoweed species distribution in China, endophyte fungus in locoweed, the toxicology mechanism of locoweed, and the swainsonine effect on reproduction.

"Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that colonize the interior of plant tissues (e.g. leaves, seeds, stem, trunk, roots, fruits, flowers) in intracellular and/or extracellular spaces without causing symptoms of disease in host plants. These microorganisms have been isolated from plant species in a wide variety of habitats worldwide, and it is estimated that all terrestrial plants are colonized by one or more species of endophytic fungus. In addition, these microorganisms have been drawing the attention of researchers because of their ability to synthesize a wide range of bioactive molecules with potential for applications in agriculture, medicine and biotechnology. However, several obstacles come up when studying the diversity and chemical potential of endophytic fungi. For example, the usage of an inappropriate surface disinfection method for plant tissue may not eliminate the epiphytic microbiota or may end up interfering with the endophytic mycobiota, which consequently generates erroneous results. Moreover, the composition of the culture medium and the culture conditions can favor the growth of certain species and inhibit others, which generates underestimated results. Other inconsistencies can arise from the fungus misidentification and consequent exploration of its chemical potential. Based on the methodological biases that may occur at all stages of studies dealing with endophytic fungi, the objective of this review is to discuss the main methods employed in these studies as well as highlight the challenges derived from the different approaches.

"Endophytic fungi possess favorable effects on their host plants, including disease-resistance improvement, secondary metabolite induction, and growth promotion. It is therefore a promising and sustainable strategy to utilize endophytic fungi for the quality improvement of medicinal herbs or important crops. In our study, a collection of 277 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated from Anoectochilus and Ludisia orchids. Two strains J162 and J211 can be symbiotically cocultured with the tissue culture seedlings of Anoectochilus roxburghii, a popular medicinal and edible plant in southern China. Both strains can significantly enhance the biomass of A. roxburghii and induce the biosynthesis and accumulation of its active ingredients, including flavonoids, kinsenoside, and polysaccharides. J162 and J211 were further identified as Chaetomium globosum and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides based on multilocus phylogenetic analysis. Immunocytochemical staining indicated that J162 and J211 mainly colonized the intercellular gap of xylem parenchyma cells of A. roxburghii roots without obvious harm. In addition, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression of three growth-related genes, namely, uracil phosphoribosyl transferase, amino acid transmembrane transporter, and maturase K, were significantly altered in A. roxburghii plants when treated with J162 and J211. In conclusion, the two strains are highly beneficial microbial resources for the growth and accumulation of active ingredients of A. roxburghii in agricultural cultivation.","J","Ye, BZ; Wu, YB; Zhai, X; Zhang, RQ; Wu, JZ; Zhang, C; Rahman, K; Qin, LP; Han, T; Zheng, CJ",NA,"","","Ye, Bingzhu; Wu, Yanbin; Zhai, Xin; Zhang, Ruoqing; Wu, Jinzhong; Zhang, Chao; Rahman, Khalid; Qin, Luping; Han, Ting; Zheng, Chengjian",NA,NA,"Beneficial Effects of Endophytic Fungi from the Anoectochilus and Ludisia Species on the Growth and Secondary Metabolism of Anoectochilus roxburghii","ACS OMEGA","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zheng, Chengjian/CAI-2262-2022; Zheng, Chengjian/CAF-6160-2022; HAN, TINGTING/GQZ-8692-2022","Zheng, Chengjian/0000-0002-7867-3438;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2470-1343","","",NA,NA,"FEB 25",2020,5,"7",NA,"","",NA,"3487","3497","","10.1021/acsomega.9b03789","http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.9b03789","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32118163,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000517796000038","View Full Record in Web of Science",673,"Presence"

"In recent years, more and more researches focus on endophytic fungi derived from important medicinal plants, which can produce the same bioactive metabolites as their host plants. Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge is a traditional medicinal plant with versatile pharmacological effects. But the wild plant resource has been in short supply due to the overcollection for bioactive metabolites. Our study was therefore conducted to isolate endophytic fungi from S. miltiorrhiza and get candidate strains that produce the same bioactive compounds as the plant. As a result, an endophyte that produces salvianolic acid C was obtained and identified as Phoma glomerata D14 based on its morphology and internal transcribed spacer analysis. Salvianolic acid C was found present in both the mycelia and fermentation broth. Our study indicates that the endophytic fungus has significant industrial potential to meet the pharmaceutical demands for salvianolic acid C in a cost-effective, easily accessible, and reproducible way.","J","Li, XQ; Zhai, X; Shu, ZH; Dong, RF; Ming, QL; Qin, LP; Zheng, CJ",NA,"","","Li, Xiuqing; Zhai, Xin; Shu, Zhiheng; Dong, Ruifang; Ming, Qianliang; Qin, Luping; Zheng, Chengjian",NA,NA,"Phoma glomerata D14: An Endophytic Fungus from Salvia miltiorrhiza That Produces Salvianolic Acid C","CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zheng, Chengjian/CAF-6160-2022; li, xq/AAL-6475-2020; Zheng, Chengjian/CAI-2262-2022; ming, qianliang/HZL-9230-2023","Zheng, Chengjian/0000-0002-7867-3438;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0343-8651","1432-0991","",NA,NA,"JUL",2016,73,"1",NA,"","",NA,"31","37","","10.1007/s00284-016-1023-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-016-1023-y","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,26979309,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000377410300005","View Full Record in Web of Science",675,"Presence"

"Endophytic fungi are a kind of fungi that colonizes living plant tissues presenting a myriad of microbial adaptations that have been developed in such a hidden environment. Owing to its large diversity and particular habituation, they present a golden mine for research in the field of drug discovery. Endophytic fungal communities possess unique biocatalytic machinery that furnishes a myriad of complex natural product scaffolds. Xanthone compounds are examples of endophytic secondary metabolic products with pronounced biological activity to include: antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antiulcer, choleretic, diuretic, and monoamine oxidase inhibiting activity. The current review compiles the recent progress made on the microbiological production of xanthones using fungal endophytes obtained from both marine and terrestrial origins, with comparisons being made among both natural resources. The biosynthesis of xanthones in endophytic fungi is outlined along with its decoding enzymes. Biotransformation reactions reported to be carried out using different endophytic microbial models are also outlined for xanthones structural modification purposes and the production of novel molecules. A promising application of novel computational tools is presented as a future direction for the goal of optimizing microbial xanthones production to include establishing metabolic pathway databases and the in silico analysis of microbial interactions. Metagenomics methods and related bioinformatics platforms are highlighted as unexplored tools for the biodiversity analysis of endophytic microbial communities that are difficult to be cultured.","J","Khattab, AR; Farag, MA",NA,"","","Khattab, Amira R.; Farag, Mohamed A.",NA,NA,"Marine and terrestrial endophytic fungi: a mine of bioactive xanthone compounds, recent progress, limitations, and novel applications","CRITICAL REVIEWS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0738-8551","1549-7801","",NA,NA,"APR 3",2022,42,"3",NA,"","",NA,"403","430","","10.1080/07388551.2021.1940087","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07388551.2021.1940087","","JUL 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34266351,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000673794300001","View Full Record in Web of Science",678,"Review"
"Endophytic fungi reside in a symbiotic fashion inside their host plants, mimic their chemistry and interestingly, produce the same natural products as their hosts and are thus being screened for the production of valuable compounds like taxol, camptothecin, podophyllotoxin, etc. Vinblastine and vincristine are excellent anti-cancer drugs but their current production using plants is non-abundant and expensive. In order to make these drugs readily available to the patients at affordable prices, we isolated the endophytic fungi from Catharanthus roseus plant and found a fungus AA-CRL-6 which produces vinblastine and vincristine in appreciable amounts. These drugs were purified by TLC and HPLC and characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, ESI-MS, MS/MS and H-1 NMR. One liter of culture filtrate yielded 76 mu g and 67 mu g of vinblastine and vincristine respectively. This endophytic fungal strain was identified as Fusarium oxysporum based upon its cultural and morphological characteristics and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analysis.","J","Kumar, A; Patil, D; Rajamohanan, PR; Ahmad, A",NA,"","","Kumar, Ashutosh; Patil, Deepak; Rajamohanan, Pattuparambil Ramanpillai; Ahmad, Absar",NA,NA,"Isolation, Purification and Characterization of Vinblastine and Vincristine from Endophytic Fungus Fusarium oxysporum Isolated from Catharanthus roseus","PLOS ONE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Patil, Deepak S/C-5688-2019","Patil, Deepak S/0000-0002-7019-9081",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1932-6203","","",NA,NA,"SEP 16",2013,8,"9",NA,"","",NA,"","","e71805","10.1371/journal.pone.0071805","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0071805","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24066024,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000324494000004","View Full Record in Web of Science",679,"Presence"
"Forty endophytic fungi isolated from ginseng plants were screened to identify metabolites that had antifungal activity against ginseng microbial pathogens. The metabolites from the fungi were extracted from the liquid culture filtrates using ethyl acetate and then evaluated in vitro for antimicrobial activity against ginseng pathogens (Alternaria panax, Botrytis cinerea, Colletotri chum panacicola, Cylindrocaipon destructans, Rhizoctonia solani, and Phytophthora cactorum). Six of the fungi (Colletotrichum pisi, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, Phoma terrestris, unknown 1 and 2) showed effective antimicrobial activity against all or some of the ginseng pathogens, with the extract of P. terrestris showing the strongest antimicrobial activity. The extract also showed inhibitory activity against spore germination of the pathogens. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of P. terrestris extract revealed that forty-one compounds were present in metabolites containing mainly N-amino-3-hydroxy-6-meth oxyphthalimide (32% of the total metabolites) and 5H-dibenz [B, F] azepine (7%). Treatment with P. terrestris extract also caused morphological changes and reduced expression of the genes involved in mycelial growth and virulence. Treatment also induced defense-related genes in detached Arabidopsis leaves that were inoculated with the pathogens. These results indicate the antimicrobial potential for use of metabolites extracted from the ginseng endophytic fungi as alternatives to chemicals for biocontrol. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

"Searching of novel bioactive compounds from natural sources is increasing day by day for overcoming multi -drug resistant microorganisms and endophytic fungi are considered as important sources in this regard. In the present study, one potent endophytic fungal isolate PE2 was isolated from the leaves of Psidium guajava L. which was identified as Alternaria tenuissima by 28S rDNA sequence homology. The isolate was found to produce thermostable, non-proteinacious antimicrobial substances. Ethyl acetate (EA) extract of the cell free supernatant (CFS) of the isolate was found effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with MIC values of-500 mg/mL and-800 mg/mL, respectively. Degradations of bacterial cells upon treat-ment were supported by the release of intracellular materials as well as scanning electron microscopic (SEM) studies. EA extract also exhibited an adverse effect on bacterial central carbohydrate metabolic pathway enzymes viz. phospho fructokinase, isocitrate dehydrogenase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Production of inhibition zones against pathogenic fungi including human pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, inhibition of fungal radial growth and conidial germination upon treatment suggested antifungal potential of the EA extract of the isolate. SEM study revealed massive deformation of cellular integrity of C. albicans, indicated the probable effect of antimicrobial compounds. Thin layer chromatographic (TLC) separation and GC-MS analysis revealed the production of numbers of bioactive compounds by the isolate. Based on the present study, isolate Alternaria tenuissima PE2 could be considered as a promising source of natural bioactive metab-olites. (c) 2022 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"To investigate the biodiversity of endophytic fungi isolated from indigenous Pelargonium sidoides plants using morphological and molecular techniques and also screen isolates for antibacterial activities. In the present study, a total of 50 Pelargonium sidoides plants were collected and the roots were analysed for the presence of endophytic fungi. The fungi were initially sorted according to morphological characteristics. Fungal identities were further confirmed through amplification of sequences encoding Translation Elongation Factor-1 alpha (TEF-1 alpha) gene for Fusarium species and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) regions for all other fungi. Fungi were screened for antibacterial activity by adopting the standard Kirby-Bauer agar disc diffusion method using a pathogenic Escherichia coil strain (Code from the collection) previously isolated from cattle. A total of 133 fungi belonging to 32 genera were successfully isolated and identified in the study based morphological analyses. Fungi belonging to the genus Penicillium were dominant (23%) among the isolates when compared with Fusarium species (12%) as well as Alternaria and Aspergillus that were detected at 11% respectively. Antibacterial agent producing data revealed that Aspergillu.s sp.

"Because of disturbance and plant species loss at the local level, many arid ecosystems in the western USA benefit from revegetation. There is a growing interest in improving revegetation success by purposefully inoculating revegetation plants with mutualistic endophytic fungi that increase plant stress tolerance. However, inoculant fungi must compete against fungi that indigenous to the habitat, many of which may not be mutualistic. Our overall goal, therefore, is to learn how to efficiently colonize revegetation plants using endophytic fungal inoculum. The goal will be facilitated by understanding the factors that limit colonization of plants by endophytic fungi, including inoculum dispersal and host compatibility. We analyzed endophytic fungal communities in leaves of Bromus tectorum and Elymus elymoides (Poaceae), Chrysothamnus depressus and Artemisia tridentata (Asteraceae), Alyssum alyssoides (Brassicaceae) and Atriplex canescens (Amaranthaceae), each occurring in each of 18 field plots. We found that dispersal limitation was significant for endophytic fungal communities of Atriplex canescens and Bromus tectorum, accounting for 9 and 17%, respectively, of the variation in endophytic fungal community structure, even though the maximum distance between plots was only 350 m. Plant species identity accounted for 33% of the variation in endophytic fungal community structure. These results indicate that the communities of endophytic fungi assembling in these plant species depend significantly on proximity to inoculum source as well as the identity of the plant species. Therefore, if endophytic fungi are to be used to facilitate revegetation by these plant species, land managers may find it profitable to consider both the proximity of inoculum to revegetation plants and the suitability of the inoculum to targeted host plant species.","J","Ricks, KD; Koide, RT",NA,"","","Ricks, Kevin D.; Koide, Roger T.",NA,NA,"The role of inoculum dispersal and plant species identity in the assembly of leaf endophytic fungal communities","PLOS ONE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Koide, Roger/AAE-7763-2020; Koide, Roger/I-4033-2012","Koide, Roger/0000-0002-5209-5422; Koide, Roger/0000-0002-5209-5422; Ricks, Kevin/0000-0001-8067-8900",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1932-6203","","",NA,NA,"JUL 16",2019,14,"7",NA,"","",NA,"","","e0219832","10.1371/journal.pone.0219832","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0219832","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31310633,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000484969300036","View Full Record in Web of Science",688,"Presence"
"The present study was conducted to explore the seasonal distribution of culturable endophytic fungi in roots of invasive plants and to investigate the antimicrobial potential of endophytic fungi against some bacterial strains.

The colonization frequency of wet season was higher with white sterile hyphae having highest relative percentage occurrence. In dry season, Cladosporium sp. was dominant followed by Penicillium sp. In total, there were 13 species isolated from both the season. Out of 13 species, the extracellular mycelial extract of 7 species showed antimicrobial activity. The maximum inhibition was exhibited by Fusarium sp. against Escherichia coli. The least inhibition was shown by Cladosporium sp. against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Three isolates showed strong antibacterial activity, which were molecularly identified as Diaporthe phaseolorum (USt1) Aspergillus fumigatus (USt2) and Aspergillus versicolor (USt3), respectively. Comparison of the components of the extracts between three isolates was made using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Thirty eight compounds were found in A. fumigatus, thirty six compounds in D. phaseolorum and fourty two compounds were found in A. versicolor. The most prevalent compounds were acetol, hexanoic acid and acetic acid in all three fungi. Hexanoic acid (39.52%), acetic acid (8.95%) and acetol (8.10%), were found in A. fumigatus. However, the D. phaseolorum extract contained mainly hexanoic acid (42.35%) and acetic acid (11.89%) and acetol (9.52%), while A. versicolor contained hexanoic acid (34.44%), acetic acid (13.44%) and acetol (10.61%). Our results suggest that the three active endophytic fungi isolates provide a basis for the identification of new bioactive compounds, and for the effective biocontrol of bacterial spot of tomato.","J","Rashid, TS",NA,"","","Rashid, Tavga Sulaiman",NA,NA,"Bioactive metabolites from tomato endophytic fungi with antibacterial activity against tomato bacterial spot disease","RHIZOSPHERE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rashid, Tavga/AAF-8411-2021; Rashid, Tavga Sulaiman/GPK-4596-2022","Rashid, Tavga/0000-0001-5105-1594;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2452-2198","",NA,NA,"MAR",2021,17,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","100292","10.1016/j.rhisph.2020.100292","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rhisph.2020.100292","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000621755200001","View Full Record in Web of Science",690,"Presence"

"Plants are all inhabited by endophytic fungi in the interior of their tissues. The neem tree Azadirachta is an Indian lilac used for various therapeutic purposes in different forms of preparations. This plant hosts different types of endophytic fungi. In some cases, different tissues of a given plant are inhabited by different endophytic fungi which are discussed in this paper. Recently, there have been new reports on endophytic fungi and their bioactive compounds from Azadirachta indica. The biological function of bioactive compounds was discussed in view of their future industrial prospects. There are a number of different research investigations that examine the endophytes isolated and screened for their potential bioactive secondary metabolites from neem, but there is no comprehensive review on neem endophytes and their secondary metabolites to bring all trends from different researchers together. Therefore, in this review, we have discussed the endophytic fungi from the different tissues of neem, in view of the latest understandings of antimicrobial, antioxidant, and pathogenicity target compounds. Importantly, tracing the previous findings would pave the way to forecast the missing link for future work by researchers.","J","Chutulo, EC; Chalannavar, RK",NA,"","","Chutulo, Eyob Chukalo; Chalannavar, Raju Krishna",NA,NA,"Endophytic Mycoflora and Their Bioactive Compounds from Azadirachta Indica: A Comprehensive Review","JOURNAL OF FUNGI","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Chalannavar, Raju/AAL-8126-2020","Chutulo, Eyob Chukalo/0000-0002-8548-2509; Chalannavar, Raju/0000-0001-6682-4537",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2309-608X","",NA,NA,"JUN",2018,4,"2",NA,"","",NA,"","","42","10.3390/jof4020042","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof4020042","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29587361,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000452634900003","View Full Record in Web of Science",692,"Review"

"Endophytic fungi are a group of microbial plant symbionts that occur in living tissues of plants without causing visible disease symptoms. The mechanism underlying the anti-insect properties of endophytes is mainly attributed to the production of various alkaloid- based defensive compounds. The current study reveals the cytotoxic effects of endophytic Nigrospora oryzae- and Cladosporium uredinicola- infected cauliflower plants on larval hemocytes of Spodoptera litura (F.). Larvae fed on leaves of endophyte- infected plants exhibited abnormalities such as change in shape, extensive vacuolization, and necrosis in significantly higher percentage of hemocytes. The percentage of abnormal hemocytes increased with increase in feeding duration. Thecytotoxic effect of endophytic fungi on the hemocytes ultimately leads to adverse effects on survival and fitness of the insect.","J","Thakur, A; Singh, V; Kaur, A; Kaur, S",NA,"","","Thakur, Abhinay; Singh, Varinder; Kaur, Amarjeet; Kaur, Sanehdeep",NA,NA,"Suppression of Cellular Immune Response in Spodoptera litura (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Larvae by Endophytic Fungi Nigrospora oryzae and Cladosporium uredinicola","ANNALS OF THE ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"THAKUR, ABHINAY/AAG-5613-2021","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0013-8746","1938-2901","",NA,NA,"MAY",2014,107,"3",NA,"","",NA,"674","679","","10.1603/AN13164","http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/AN13164","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000335662600015","View Full Record in Web of Science",694,"Presence"
"Assam, India being the pool for ethnomedicinal plants harbors diverse endophytic fungi constituting major bioactive metabolites. The present study was designed to screen the antioxidant, antibacterial activities along with the chemical constituents of the endophytic fungi isolated from the fruits of Dillenia indica (commonly known as Otenga in Assam). Screening of such metabolic compounds and their antioxidant, antibacterial activities can have tremendous potential in suppressing certain diseases. Agar well diffusion method has been used to carry out the antibacterial assay against three pathogenic bacteria two gram positive [Bacillus subtilis (MTCC No. 441); Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC No. 740)] and one gram negative [Escherichia coli (MTCC No. 739)]. Aspergillus fumigatus of ethyl acetate extract showed a prominent activity against Staphylococcus aureus followed by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. Antioxidants have the potential to neutralize and inhibit the action of free radicals. The highest scavenging activity was exhibited by ethyl acetate extract of Aspergillus fumigatus in DPPH assay. Furthermore, the phytochemical screening revealed the presence of flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids and saponins. Result showed that ethyl acetate extract of Aspergillus fumigatus showed the highest phenolic content (236.81 +/- 0.2 mg.g(-1)) and least was shown by Aspergillus flavus (92.12 +/- 1.4 mg.g(-1)). Total flavonoids content for Aspergillus fumigatus (39.08 +/- 0.2 mg.g(-1)) was found to be highest compared to other isolates. Molecular identification of the endophytic fungus showing highest activity was done based on 18S rRNA. The sequenced was submitted in Genbank with accession number MH540721 showing high similarities with Aspergillus fumigatus strain 3,162,954. A. fumigatus strain is subjected to GC/MS analysis that revealed the chemical constituents 2-isopropyl-5-methyl-1-heptanol, dodecane, 1-fluoro-pentanoic acid, 2-ethylhexyl ester, 1-octanol, 2-butyl-1-dodecanol. Thus, the present work reveals that endophytic fungi colonizing in ethnomedicinal plant Dillenia indica could be a promising source for antioxidant and antibacterial activity.

"Amaryllidaceae family comprises many crops of high market potential for the food and pharmaceutical industries. Nowadays, the utilization of plants as a source of bioactive compounds requires the plant/endophytic microbiome interactions, which affect all aspects of crop's quantity and quality. This review highlights the taxonomy, ecology, and bioactive chemicals synthesized by endophytic fungi isolated from plants of the Amaryllidaceae family with a focus on the detection of pharmaceutically valuable plant and fungi constituents. The fungal microbiome of Amaryllidaceae is species- and tissue-dependent, although dominating endophytes are ubiquitous and isolated worldwide from taxonomically different hosts. Root sections showed higher colonization as compared to bulbs and leaves through the adaptation of endophytic fungi to particular morphological and physiological conditions of the plant tissues. Fungal endophytes associated with Amaryllidaceae plants are a natural source of ecofriendly bioagents of unique activities, with special regard to those associated with Amarylloidae subfamily. The latter may be exploited as stimuli of alkaloids production in host tissues or can be used as a source of these compounds through in vitro synthesis. Endophytes also showed antagonistic potential against fungal, bacterial, and viral plant diseases and may find an application as alternatives to synthetic pesticides. Although Amaryllidaceae crops are cultivated worldwide and have great economic importance, the knowledge on their endophytic fungal communities and their biochemical potential has been neglected so far.","J","Caruso, G; Golubkina, N; Tallarita, A; Abdelhamid, MT; Sekara, A",NA,"","","Caruso, Gianluca; Golubkina, Nadezhda; Tallarita, Alessio; Abdelhamid, Magdi T.; Sekara, Agnieszka",NA,NA,"Biodiversity, Ecology, and Secondary Metabolites Production of Endophytic Fungi Associated with Amaryllidaceae Crops","AGRICULTURE-BASEL","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Abdelhamid, Magdi T./F-5710-2011; Sekara, Agnieszka/F-2436-2016","Abdelhamid, Magdi T./0000-0003-1714-3932; Sekara, Agnieszka/0000-0002-9655-5742",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2077-0472","",NA,NA,"NOV",2020,10,"11",NA,"","",NA,"","","533","10.3390/agriculture10110533","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agriculture10110533","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000592329500001","View Full Record in Web of Science",696,"Review"
"Huperzine A (HupA) is an effective inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase and has attracted great interest as a therapeutic candidate for Alzheimer's disease. However, the use of HupA is limited by resource scarcity as well as by its low yields fromHuperzia serrata,its primary plant source. Recent studies have shown that this compound is produced by various endophytic fungi, thereby providing a promising alternative source, as fungi are much more amenable than plants owing to their simpler genetics and the ease of manipulation. In this review, we summarize the progress in research on the methods to increase HupA production, including fermentation conditions, fungal elicitors, gene expression, and the activation of key enzymes. This review provides guidance for further studies on HupA-producing endophytic fungi aimed at efficient HupA synthesis and accumulation, and offers new approaches for studies on the regulation of high-value bioactive secondary metabolites.","J","Sang, X; Yang, MH; Su, JQ",NA,"","","Sang, Xiao; Yang, Minhe; Su, Jingqian",NA,NA,"Research on endophytic fungi for producing huperzine A on a large-scale","CRITICAL REVIEWS IN MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Su, Jingqian/AAR-3115-2021","Su, Jingqian/0000-0002-0920-7177",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1040-841X","1549-7828","",NA,NA,"NOV 1",2020,46,"6",NA,"","",NA,"654","664","","10.1080/1040841X.2020.1819771","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1040841X.2020.1819771","","SEP 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32970952,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000572522800001","View Full Record in Web of Science",697,"Review"
"BACKGROUND: Rice spikelet rot disease (RSRD) is an emerging disease that significantly reduces rice yield and quality. In this study, we evaluated the potential use of the broad-spectrum endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris B3 as a biocontrol agent against RSRD. We also compared the control effects of different treatments, including chemical fungicides and treatment with multiple strains and single strains in combination or individually, against RSRD. The objective of this study was to find an effective and environmentally friendly control strategy to reduce the occurrence of RSRD and improve the rice yield. RESULTS: In pot experiments, the effect of B3 alone was better than that of fungicide or combined measures. The results showed that root colonization by B3 significantly reduced the incidence and disease index of RSRD by 41.0% and 53.8%, respectively. This was related to enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, and to significantly upregulated expression levels of OsAOX, OsLOX, OsPAL, and OsPR10 in rice. Moreover, B3 improved the diversity of the bacterial community rather than the fungal community in the rice rhizosphere. It also led to a decrease in Fusarium proliferatum colonization and fumonisin content in the grain. Finally, root development was markedly promoted after B3 inoculation, and the yield improved by 48.60%. The result of field experiments showed that the incidence of RSRD and the fumonisin content were observably reduced in rice receiving B3, by 24.41% and 37.87%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris B3 may become an effective tool to relieve rice spikelet rot disease.

"Endophytic fungi constitute a major part of the still unexplored fungal diversity and have gained interest as new biological sources of natural active compounds, including enzymes. Endophytic fungi were isolated from soybean leaves and initially screened on agar plates for the production of CMCase (carboxymethylcellulase), xylanase, amylase and protease. The highest Enzymatic Indexes (IE) were verified for xylanase (2.14 and 1.31) with the fungi M6-A6P5F2 and M12-A5P3F1.2 and CMCase (1.92 and 1.62) with the fungi M13-A9P2F1 and M12-A5P3F1.2, respectively. The production of xylanase and CMCase by the selected fungi was evaluated in submerged cultivation using beechwood xylan and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), as well as sugarcane straw and bagasse in different ratios as carbon sources. Both types of lignocellulosic biomass proved to be good inducers of enzymatic activity. The best xylanase producer among the isolates was identified as Colletotrichum boninense. With this fungus, the highest xylanase activity was obtained with a sugarcane straw-bagasse mixture in a 50:50 ratio (383.63 U mL(-1)), a result superior to that obtained with the use of beechwood xylan (296.65 U mL(-1)). Regardingthe kinetic behavior of the crude xylanase, there was found optimal pH of 5.0 and optimal temperatures of 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C. At 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C, xylanase retained 87% and 76% of its initial catalytic activity, respectively.

"The aim of our study was to examine the different concentrations of AuNPs as a new antimicrobial substance to control the pathogenic activity. The extracellular synthesis of AuNPs performed by using Phoma sp. as an endophytic fungus. Endophytic fungus was isolated from vascular tissue of peach trees (Prunus persica) from Baft, located in Kerman province, Iran. The UltraViolet-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis spectroscopy) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy provided the absorbance peak at 526 nm, while the X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy images released the formation of spherical AuNPs with sizes in the range of 10-100 nm. The findings of inhibition zone test of Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) showed a desirable antifungal and antibacterial activity against phytopathogens including Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IA (AG1-IA has been identified as the dominant anastomosis group) and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. The highest inhibition level against sclerotia formation was 93% for AuNPs at a concentration of 80 mu g/mL. Application of endophytic fungus biomass for synthesis of AuNPs is relatively inexpensive, single step and environmentally friendly. In vitro study of the antifungal activity of AuNPs at concentrations of 10, 20, 40 and 80 mu g/mL was conducted against rice fungal pathogen R. solani to reduce sclerotia formation. The experimental data revealed that the Inhibition rate (RH) for sclerotia formation was (15, 33, 74 and 93%), respectively, for their corresponding AuNPs concentrations (10, 20, 40 and 80 mu g/mL). Our findings obviously indicated that the RH strongly depend on AuNPs rates, and enhance upon an increase in AuNPs rates. The application of endophytic fungi biomass for green synthesis is our future goal.","J","Nejad, MS; Najafabadi, NS; Aghighi, S; Pakina, E; Zargar, M",NA,"","","Soltani Nejad, Meysam; Samandari Najafabadi, Neda; Aghighi, Sonia; Pakina, Elena; Zargar, Meisam",NA,NA,"Evaluation of Phoma sp.

"Endophytes are isolated from every plant species investigated to date, so the metabolome coevolution has been affecting the plants' (microbiota) ethnobotanic, especially therapeutic, usage. Asteraceae fulfill the rationale for plant selection to isolate endophytes since most of the species of this family have a long tradition of healing usage, confirmed by modern pharmacognosy. The present review compiles recent references on the endophyte-Asteraceae spp. interactions, targeting the secondary metabolites profile as created by both members of this biological system. Endophyte fungi associated with Asteraceae have been collected globally, however, dominant taxa that produce bioactive compounds were specific for the plant populations of different geographic origins. Endophytic fungi richness within the host plant and the biological activity were positively associated. Moreover, the pharmacological action was linked to the plant part, so differential forms of biological interactions in roots, stem, leaves, inflorescences were developed between endophytic fungi and host plants. The comparative analysis of the Asteraceae host and/or fungal endophyte therapeutic activity showed similarities that need a future explanation on the metabolome level.","J","Caruso, G; Abdelhamid, MT; Kalisz, A; Sekara, A",NA,"","","Caruso, Gianluca; Abdelhamid, Magdi T.; Kalisz, Andrzej; Sekara, Agnieszka",NA,NA,"Linking Endophytic Fungi to Medicinal Plants Therapeutic Activity.

"The potential for endophytes to initiate changes in host secondary metabolism has been well documented. However, the mechanisms underlying endophyte-plant metabolic interactions are still poorly understood. Here, we analysed the effects of fungal endophytes on the metabolite profiles of grape cells from two cultivars: 'Cabernet Sauvignon' (CS) and 'Rose honey' (RH). Our results clearly showed that co-culture with endophytic fungi greatly modified the metabolic profiles in grape cells of both varieties. Treatments with endophytic fungal strains caused the numbers of detected metabolites to vary from 10 to 19 in CS cells and from 8 to 14 in RH cells. In addition, 5 metabolites were detected in all CS cell samples, while 4 metabolites were detected in all RH cell samples. Some endophytic fungal strains could even introduce novel metabolites into the co-cultured grape cells. The metabolic profiles of grape leaves shaped by endophytic fungi exhibited host selectivity and fungal strain specificity. In this assay, the fungal strains RH32 (Alternaria sp.) and MDR36 (Colletotrichum sp.) triggered an increased response of the detected metabolites, including the greatest increase in the metabolite contents in grape cells of both cultivars. No obvious effects in terms of metabolite numbers and contents in grape cells when co-cultured with fungal strains RH7 (Epicoccum sp.) and RH48 (Colletotrichum sp.) were observed. The results of this experiment suggest that endophytic fungi could be used to control the metabolic profiles of grapes and thus increase grape quality.","J","Pan, XX; Yuan, MQ; Chen, JC; Yu, M; Qu, JZ; Liu, F; Xiang, SY; Zhu, YY; Yang, MZ",NA,"","","Pan, Xiao-Xia; Yuan, Ming-Quan; Chen, Jing-Chao; Yu, Man; Qu, Jin-Zhuo; Liu, Fang; Xiang, Si-Yu; Zhu, You-Yong; Yang, Ming-Zhi",NA,NA,"Diverse and strain-specific metabolites patterns induced by fungal endophytes in grape cells of different varieties","VITIS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0042-7500","","",NA,NA,"",2020,59,"4",NA,"","",NA,"155","162","","10.5073/vitis.2020.59.155-162","http://dx.doi.org/10.5073/vitis.2020.59.155-162","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000611972800003","View Full Record in Web of Science",706,"Presence"

"Asari Radix et Rhizoma is commonly used in classic prescriptions of herbal medicine in several Asian countries for resuscitation, pain relief, and sore treatment, and Asarum heterotropoides (A. heterotropoides) is an important source material of Asari Radix et Rhizoma. However, the plants of the Asari Radix et Rhizoma and some plants in Asarum spp. contain aristolochic acid I (AAI), which is considered as a carcinogen. The objective of the current study is to detoxify Asarum spp. through microbial degradation of AAI in order to ensure drug safety. Based on the observation of the close correlation between endophytic fungi of A. heterotropoides and AAI, we identified an AAI-degrading fungus and screened for candidate genes involved in AAI degradation. Full-length O-demethylase genes (ODMs) were cloned including A.h-ODM-5, Fs-ODM-4, and Fs-ODM-1, and their ability to degrade AAI was tested in vitro. The results showed that the AAI-degrading fungus was identified as Neocosmospora solani (A.h-Fs-1, endophytic fungi of A. heterotropoides), and verified the capability of specific O-demethylation to modify the structure of AAI. We further identified the functional ODMs in A.h-Fs-1 capable of degrading AAI and uncovered the AAI degradation mechanism of A.h-Fs-1. The microbial degradation of AAI demonstrated in the present study offers a new method to detoxify plant materials used for herbal medicine, and would enhance the regulation of toxic ingredients content in herbal medicine source materials.","J","Wang, XH; Jiang, D; Shi, QJ; Ren, GX; Liu, CS",NA,"","","Wang, Xiaohan; Jiang, Dan; Shi, Qijin; Ren, Guangxi; Liu, Chunsheng",NA,NA,"Microbial degradation of aristolochic acid I by endophytic fungus A.h-Fs-1 of Asarum heterotropoides","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1664-302X","",NA,NA,"JUL 22",2022,13,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","917117","10.3389/fmicb.2022.917117","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.917117","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35935204,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000837139100001","View Full Record in Web of Science",708,"Presence"
"Sophora alopecuroides L. is a traditional Chinese medicine used for the treatment of several different disease states including bacillary dysentery and enteritis. But importantly, it also plays a role as an anti-tumor agent. That said, little is known about the role endophytes play regarding the clinically bioactive metabolites in S. alopecuroides. In order to explore the effects of endophytic fungi on the accumulation, quality, and correlation in the content of the medicinal compounds, the structural diversity of endophytic fungi in S. alopecuroides was analyzed. The relationship between endophytes and quinolizidine alkaloids (QAs), housed within the seeds of S. alopecuroides, which were interpreted based on established methods of high-throughput sequencing and high-performance liquid chromatography. A total of 1,034,418 effective sequence reads and 257 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained from 33 samples which were sourced from 11 different sampling sites and further classified into 9 phyla, 20 classes, 45 orders, 85 families, and 118 genera. Ascomycota was found to be the dominant phylum of endophytic fungi in S. alopecuroides, with a relative abundance ranging from 60.85 to 98.30%. Alternaria, Cladosporium, Filobasidium, and an unidentified Ascomycota were the core-shared endophytes, accounting for 49.96, 27.12, 14.83, and 7.88%, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that the Simpson's diversity index of endophytic fungal community in S. alopecuroides was significantly positively correlated with the Oxymatrine (OMA) content in different areas, while the Chao and Shannoneven indexes were significantly negatively correlated with OMA. The endophytic fungi of Alternaria were positively correlated with the content of OMA, Oxysophocarpine (OSC), and total QAs. This study has mastered the endophytic fungi resources of S. alopecuroides, explored potential functional endophytic fungi, and provided a scientific basis for using biological fertilization strategies to improve the quality of S. alopecuroides.","J","Ju, MX; Zhang, QC; Wang, RT; Yan, SY; Li, ZN; Li, P; Gu, PW",NA,"","","Ju, Mingxiu; Zhang, Qingchen; Wang, Ruotong; Yan, Siyuan; Li, Zhengnan; Li, Peng; Gu, Peiwen",NA,NA,"Correlation in endophytic fungi community diversity and bioactive compounds of Sophora alopecuroides","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Li, Zheng-Nan/JGD-6461-2023","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1664-302X","",NA,NA,"AUG 31",2022,13,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","955647","10.3389/fmicb.2022.955647","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.955647","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36118208,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000864085600001","View Full Record in Web of Science",709,"Presence"

"The present work studied the characterization and bioactivities of the mycogenic silver nanoparticles (PREAgNPs) synthesized from the endophytic fungus Penicillium radiatolobatum. The maximum UV-spectrum absorption peak at 410-420 nm indicated the formation of PRE-AgNPs. The average zeta potential, size, and PDI of -22.2 +/- 0.8 mV, 72.04 nm, and 0.143 were found for PRE-AgNPs respectively. The face-centered cubic crystal structure of PRE-AgNPs was indicated by XRD analysis. TEM micrograph showed the polydispersed and anisotropic structure of PRE-AgNPs with size ranged from 5.09 to 24.85 nm. FTIR evidenced that involvements of functional molecules from the PRE in the synthesis of PRE-AgNPs. The PRE-AgNPs inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica higher than the Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. Further, the higher concentration of PRE-AgNPs (120 mu g/mL) did not show any cytotoxicity to HEK293 cells. But it caused significant cytotoxicity to the human lung carcinoma cell line (A549) with the IC50 of 19.67 +/- 3.09 mu g/ mL through activation of ROS-induced cell death. Overall, this work proved the antibacterial and cytotoxicity activity of the PRE-AgNPs derived from P. radiatolobatum and which is deserved for the further molecular elucidation of bioactivities.","J","Naveen, KV; Sathiyaseelan, A; Mariadoss, AVA; Xiaowen, H; Saravanakumar, K; Wang, MH",NA,"","","Naveen, Kumar Vishven; Sathiyaseelan, Anbazhagan; Mariadoss, Arokia Vijaya Anand; Xiaowen, Hu; Saravanakumar, Kandasamy; Wang, Myeong-Hyeon",NA,NA,"Fabrication of mycogenic silver nanoparticles using endophytic fungal extract and their characterization, antibacterial and cytotoxic activities","INORGANIC CHEMISTRY COMMUNICATIONS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sathiyaseelan, Anbazhagan/AAP-4479-2020; Anand, Mariadoss Arokia Vijaya/AAA-7033-2020; Saravanakumar, Kandasamy/P-6745-2018","Sathiyaseelan, Anbazhagan/0000-0001-8142-0063; Anand, Mariadoss Arokia Vijaya/0000-0001-6154-7366; Saravanakumar, Kandasamy/0000-0002-4465-4378; Myeong-Hyeon, Wang/0000-0003-1760-1622",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1387-7003","1879-0259","",NA,NA,"JUN",2021,128,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","108575","10.1016/j.inoche.2021.108575","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.inoche.2021.108575","","MAR 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000649670400005","View Full Record in Web of Science",715,"Presence"
"Deschampsia antarctica Desv. (Poaceae) represents one of the two vascular plants that have colonized the Antarctic continent, which is usually exposed to extreme environmental conditions. In this work, we have characterized the endophytic fungi associated with the leaves of D. antarctica. Endophytic fungi were recovered from 91 individual plants from different points of Admiralty Bay at King George Island, Antarctica. A total of 26 fungal isolates were obtained from 273 leaf fragments. All isolates were identified by analysis of the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the rDNA. Alternaria and Phaeosphaeria were the most frequent genera associated with the plant. Other fungal isolates were identified as Entrophospora sp. and several undescribed Ascomycete species. An interesting result was obtained for the isolates UFMGCB 215 and UFMGCB 262, which were related to fungi associated with bryophytes present in boreal ecosystems. Some isolates showed low identity in the ITS sequences to sequences of fungal species deposited in GenBank, suggesting that these fungi could be new species.

"Taxol or paclitaxel, an approved drug by the Food and Drug Administration, is being used for the treatment of human cancers. This study aimed to isolate and determine different species of native endophytic fungi from Iranian Taxus baccata (yew) plants located in the northern forests of Iran. To do so, a novel molecular screening approach was performed for 50 isolated endophytic fungi through amplification of exon No. 1 of taxadine synthase as a key gene in taxol production pathway. We used effective colony-polymerase chain reaction technique for rapid screening of potent taxol-producing fungi instead of genomic DNA extraction. Production of taxol was performed in batch culture by selected fungi individually and produced taxol was assayed quantitatively by high-performance liquid chromatography using standard taxanes. We found that only six fungi could produce taxol and baccatin III. Interestingly, after 7 days of incubation, the highest level of taxol was found to be 129 and that of baccatin 139.2 mg/kg dw for two native isolated Cladosporium sp. named F1 and F3. The fungal taxols could decrease cell viability in MTT assay same as commercial taxol. The fungal taxols semi-quantitatively showed antimitotic effects on MCF-7 cells as human breast cancer cell line. The expression of bcl-2 anti-apoptotic gene, in contrast to bax pro-apoptotic gene, significantly decreased after treatment by standard and fungal taxols. As fungal taxol was produced simpler than other methods and could significantly affect viability and specific genes expression profile, it is recommended that using of taxol-producing fungi from Iranian yew could be a safe and confident procedure to overcome challenges of using other methods.","J","Kasaei, A; Mobini-Dehkordi, M; Mahjoubi, F; Saffar, B",NA,"","","Kasaei, Abdollah; Mobini-Dehkordi, Mohsen; Mahjoubi, Foruzandeh; Saffar, Behnaz",NA,NA,"Isolation of Taxol-Producing Endophytic Fungi from Iranian Yew Through Novel Molecular Approach and Their Effects on Human Breast Cancer Cell Line","CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mahjoubi, frouzandeh/AHC-2557-2022; Mobini-Dehkordi, Mohsen/N-5332-2019","Mobini-Dehkordi, Mohsen/0000-0002-0739-7878; Mahjoubi, Frouzandeh/0000-0002-6880-3606",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0343-8651","1432-0991","",NA,NA,"JUN",2017,74,"6",NA,"","",NA,"702","709","","10.1007/s00284-017-1231-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-017-1231-0","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28332162,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000400072000006","View Full Record in Web of Science",717,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi of 3 age classes (seeds, seedlings, and mature plants) and 5 tissue classes (cotyledons, seed coats, roots, stems, and leaves) of coastal sand dune legumes Canavalia cathartica and Canavalia maritima were assessed by plating surface-sterilized segments on malt extract agar. Forty-six fungal taxa comprising 6 ascomycetes, 33 mitosporic fungi, 2 zygomycetes, and 5 sterile morphospecies were recovered. There was no significant difference in the colonization frequency of endophytes between plant species (p = 0.4098, Student's t test). Among the age classes, endophytic fungi colonized over 90% of seedlings and mature plants. Similarly, among tissue classes, endophytic fungi colonized over 90% of root, stem, and leaf segments. Diversity and richness of endophytic fungi were higher in C. cathartica than in C. maritima. Rarefaction curves revealed a higher expected number of species in mature plants of C. cathartica and seedlings of C. maritima, whereas it was highest in leaves of both plant species. The most dominant endophyte, Chaetomium globosum, colonized over 50% of the root, stem, and leaf segments of C. maritima and over 50% of the root segments of C. cathartica. The colonization frequency of C. globosum was found to be 5%-12.5% in seeds and increased up to 40%-64.4% in seedlings or mature plants.

"The purpose of the present study was to discover antimicrobial endophytic fungi from Astragalus chinensis. Three fungal endophytes with antibacterial activity were isolated and determined as Chaetomium sp. HQ-1, Fusarium sp. HQ-7 and Fusarium sp. HQ-9 based on the neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree. Chaetomium sp. HQ-1 showed the best antibiotic potential and was thus selected for large-scale fermentation. Bioactivity-directed separation of ME fermentation of strain HQ-1 led to the discovery of three compounds, which were identified as differanisole A (1), 2,6-dichloro-4-propylphenol (2) and 4,5-dimethylresorcinol (3), from the HR-ESI-MS and NMR data analysis. All three compounds exhibited moderate antibacterial activity against Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, with MIC values ranging from 16 to 128 mu g/mL. Compounds 1 and 3 also displayed promising antifungal activity against Selerotium rolfsii with IC50 values of less than 16 and 32 mu g/mL, respectively, which were comparable to that of actidione (8 mu g/mL).

"Endophytes may play important roles in phytoremediation: however, little information is available on the endophytes of phosphorus (P)-accumulating plants and their potential application in P-phytoextraction. Here, 30 endophytic fungi were isolated from Polygonum hydropiper and classified into 24 taxonomic groups, with 76.7% being Ascomycota and 23.3% being Basidiomycota. Metarhizium anisopliae, Guignardia mangiferae and Phaeophlebiopsis peniophoroides were the dominant species. The Simpson and Shannon diversity indices were higher in shoots than in roots. The isolates had varied plant-growthpromoting traits with all being indole-3-acetic acid positive and only 18 exhibiting siderophore activities. P solubilization capability varied with fungal species and P sources; it correlated negatively with pH but positively with organic acids in a tricalcium phosphate medium. However, in a phytin medium, it did not correlate with pH, but positively with phosphatase activities.

A total of 360 fragments of leaflets and branches were analysed and 189 endophytic fungi were isolated and distributed among 21 ascomycetous genera based on their ITS and LSU rDNA sequences. Diaporthe was the most frequently identified genus, followed by Didymella and Rhytidhysteron. The colonisation rate of plant fragments was higher in the branches (74 %) than in leaflets (14 %). The richness of the genera of endophytic fungi was also higher in the branches than in leaflets, whereas no difference was observed in endophyte diversity between the plant parts, based on Shannon-Wiener and Fisher alpha diversity indices.

"Endophytic fungi reside in the intercellular space of plant nourished by the plant. In return, they provide bioactive molecules which can play critical roles on plant defense system. Fifty six endophytes were isolated from the leaves, root, bark and fruits of Sonneratia apetala, a pioneer mangrove plant in the Sundarbans, Bangladesh. A total of 56 isolates were obtained and 12 different species within 8 genera were identified using morphological and molecular characteristics. Antimicrobial activity of ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and methanolic (MeOH) extracts of these 12 different species were analyzed by resazurin assay and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined. The fungal extracts showed antimicrobial activities against more than one tested bacterium or fungus among 5 human pathogenic microbes, i.e. Escherichia coli NCTC 12241, Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 12981, Micrococcus lutus NCTC 7508, Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCTC 7508 and Candida albicans ATCC 90028. Overall, methanolic extracts showed greater activity than that of ethyl acetate extracts. Of the isolates identified, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Aspergillus niger and Fusarium equiseti were the most active isolates and showed activity against microorganisms under investigation. Methanolic extracts of C. gloeosporioides and A. niger showed the lowest MIC (0.0024 mg/mL) against P. aeruginosa. The study indicates that endophytic fungi isolated from S. apetala species possess potential antimicrobial properties, which could be further investigated.","J","Nurunnabi, TR; Sabrin, F; Sharif, DI; Nahar, L; Sohrab, MH; Sarker, SD; Rahman, SMM; Billah, MM",NA,"","","Nurunnabi, Tauhidur R.; Sabrin, Farah; Sharif, Dilara I.; Nahar, Lutfun; Sohrab, Md.

"Five halophytic plant species, Suaeda maritima, Limonium tetragonum, Suaeda australis, Phragmites australis, and Suaeda glauca Bunge, which are native to the Muan salt marsh of South Korea, were examined for fungal endophytes by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region containing ITS1, 5.8S rRNA, and ITS2. In total, 160 endophytic fungal strains were isolated and identified from the roots of the 5 plant species. Taxonomically, all 160 strains belonged to the phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota. The most dominant genus was Fusarium, followed by the genera Penicillium and Alternaria. Subsequently, using 5 statistical methods, the diversity indices of the endophytes were determined at genus level. Among these halophytic plants, P. australis was found to host the greatest diversity of endophytic fungi. Culture filtrates of endophytic fungi were treated to Waito-C rice seedlings for plant growth-promoting effects. The fungal strain Su-3-4-3 isolated from S. glauca Bunge provide the maximum plant length (20.1 cm) in comparison with wild-type Gibberella fujikuroi (19.6 cm). Consequently, chromatographic analysis of the culture filtrate of Su-3-4-3 showed the presence of physiologically active gibberellins, GA 1 (0.465 ng/mL), GA 3 (1.808 ng/mL) along with other physiologically inactive GA 9 (0.054 ng/mL) and GA 24 (0.044 ng/mL).

"Objectives This study aimed to evaluate endophytic fungi isolated from Tocoyena bullata and Humiria balsamifera plant species for their antimycobacterial and anti-inflammatory activities, focusing on severe pulmonary tuberculosis cases which are often associated with exacerbated inflammation. Methods Mycobacterium suspensions were incubated with the samples for 5 days. RAW 264.7 macrophages stimulated with LPS were also incubated with them for 24 h to assess the inhibition of inflammatory mediator production and cytotoxicity. C57BL/6 mice were infected with Mtb M299 and treated for 15 days with lasiodiplodin (Lasio). Key findings Endophytic fungus Sordaria tamaensis, obtained from T. bullata, was the most promising. Its ethanolic extract impaired mycobacterial growth with MIC50 (mu g/ml): 1.5 +/- 0.6 (BCG), 66.8 +/- 0.1 (H37Rv) and 80.0 +/- 0.1 (M299). (R)-(+)-Lasio showed MIC50 92.2 +/- 1.8 mu g/ml (M299). In addition, Lasio was able to inhibit NO, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha production and was not cytotoxic for macrophages. M. tuberculosis-infected C57BL/6 animals treated by Lasio reduced the number of acid-fast bacilli, lung pathology, leucocyte influx and proinflammatory cytokine production in the lungs. The class IIa fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase was the predicted hypothetical target of Lasio. Conclusions (R)-(+)-Lasio stood out as a promising anti-TB compound, exhibiting anti-inflammatory and antimycobacterial effects, as well as low cytotoxicity.","J","Calixto, SD; Simao, TLBV; De Almeida, FM; Antunes, SS; Romeiro, NC; Borges, WD; Das Chagas, FO; Seldin, L; De Carvalho, ECQ; Andrioli, WJ; Guimaraes, DO; Lasunskaia, E; Muzitano, MF",NA,"","","Calixto, Sanderson Dias; Bia Ventura Simao, Thatiana Lopes; de Almeida, Fabricio Moreira; Antunes, Stella Schuenck; Romeiro, Nelilma Correia; Borges, Warley de Souza; das Chagas, Fernanda Oliveira; Seldin, Lucy; Queiroz de Carvalho, Eulogio Carlos; Andrioli, Willian Jonis; Guimaraes, Denise Oliveira; Lasunskaia, Elena; Muzitano, Michelle Frazao",NA,NA,"(R)-(+)-Lasiodiplodin isolated from the endophytic fungus Sordaria tamaensis exhibits potent antimycobacterial and anti-inflammatory activities in vitro and in vivo: a dual approach for the treatment of severe pulmonary tuberculosis","JOURNAL OF PHARMACY AND PHARMACOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Chagas, Fernanda/GYV-0091-2022; Chagas, Fernanda Oliveira/GYV-0042-2022; Romeiro, Nelilma C/H-8719-2013; Guimarães, Denise/AAW-4576-2021; Chagas, Fernanda/V-6059-2019","Chagas, Fernanda Oliveira/0000-0001-9534-3521; Chagas, Fernanda/0000-0001-9534-3521; Schuenck Antunes, Stella/0000-0001-9568-9928",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0022-3573","2042-7158","",NA,NA,"MAR 3",2022,74,"3",NA,"","",NA,"446","457","","10.1093/jpp/rgab165","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jpp/rgab165","","NOV 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34850064,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000764264100015","View Full Record in Web of Science",730,"Presence"

"The emergence of bacterial infections caused by resistant strains poses a threat to the development of new antibiotics. The majority of antibiotics being produced has been accelerated through the finding of newly reported natural products, especially those originated and produced by biological sources. Endophytic fungi residing in medicinal plants may be regarded as potential sources and encourage the exploration of more plant species for their antimicrobial activity. Our current study reports on the assemblage of endophytic fungi that colonize the rhizomes, using Globba patens a representative of Zingiberaceous species from North Sumatra. Twenty-six fungal morphotypes were obtained and differentiated by their morphological features. Each isolate was tested against human pathogenic bacteria namely Staphylococcus aureus ATCC? 29213TM, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) ATCC? 43300*, Escherichia coli ATCC? 25922*, and Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) K11 in a dual culture assay. The results revealed that the majority of fungal isolates were strong antagonists against S. aureus and E. coli but not against MRSA and EPEC. Isolate Gp07 was the most potential fungus with a wide range of antibacterial activities and was subjected to further species-level identification based on its morphological characteristics and DNA sequence in the ITS-rDNA region. The isolate Gp07 was identified as Colletotrichum siamense, yet the presence of C. siamense in the rhizome of G. patens is not fully understood while possibly being characterized as the antibiotics-producing agent in the future.","J","Lutfia, A; Munir, E; Yurnaliza, Y; Basyuni, M",NA,"","","Lutfia, Anisa; Munir, Erman; Yurnaliza, Yurnaliza; Basyuni, Mohammad",NA,NA,"Antagonistic Activity of Endophytic Fungi Isolated from Globba patens Miq.

"Submerged cultures of some 1500 Ascomycota and Basidiomycota isolated from their fruit-bodies or as soil-borne, coprophilous or endophytic fungi were screened for activity against Candida albicans and a range of other pathogenic and saprotrophic fungi. Considerably more Ascomycota (11-16%) than Basidiomycota (3.5%) produced metabolites with activity against C. albicans. From five species of endophytes, six bioactive compounds were isolated and identified, viz. cerulenin (1), arundifungin (2), sphaeropsidin A (3), 5-(1,3-butadiene-1-yl)-3-(propene-1-yl)-2-(5H)-furanone (4), ascosteroside A (formerly called ascosteroside; 5) and a derivative of 5, ascosteroside B (6). 1, 3 and 5 were isolated from fungi belonging to different orders than previously described producers. Antifungal activities of 2 and 4-6 in the agar diffusion test were comparable with those of amphotericin B. Compound 6 exhibited a similar antifungal activity as 5 but its cytotoxicity towards Hep G2 cells was considerably lower.

"Endophytic fungi are found in most, if not all, plant species on the planet. They colonise inner plant tissues without causing symptoms of disease, thus providing benefits to the host plant while also benefiting from this interaction. The global concern for the development of more sustainable agriculture has increased in recent years, and research has been performed to decipher ecology and explore the potential of endophytic interactions in plant growth. To date, many studies point to the positive aspects of endophytic colonisation, and in this review, such research is summarised based on the direct (acquisition of nutrients and phytohormone production) and indirect (induced resistance, production of antibiotics and secondary metabolites, production of siderophores and protection for abiotic and biotic stresses) benefits of endophytic colonisation.

"Endophytic fungi are extremely diverse in natural biomes, which display a unique plant-microbe association inside different living host tissues. Among the plants that shelter endophytes, the endophytic fungal assemblages of Cactaceae remain poorly understood. Our study characterized the taxonomy, diversity, and ecology of endophytic fungal assemblages living in different tissues of the cactus Melocactus ernestii present in the Brazilian Caatinga biome. A total of 222 endophytic fungi were obtained from roots, stems, and spines, which were identified in 99 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla. Most of the fungal taxa were recovered from root tissues, followed by stems and spines. The most abundant orders from Ascomycota were Xylariales, Dothideomycetes, and Eurotiomycetes. Basidiomycota is represented by Cantharellales, Agaricales, and Geastrales. Only Nigrospora sp. and Preussia sp. 1 were common among the three plant tissues, and 78.41% of the species were not shared among the populations and tissues. We detected similar richness patterns among the same tissue types using sample-based rarefaction and extrapolation curves. The multiple site dissimilarity across the plants and tissues showed greater disparities in species richness among M. ernestii fungal assemblages.

"The present paper deals with the endophytic fungi of Litsea glutinosa, a medicinal plant highly valued in Ayurvedic system. A total of 21 fungal endophytes were extracted from different parts of the plant. The following eight species viz, Aspergillus oryzae, A. terreus, Curvularia sp, Fusarium oxysporum, Gliocladium solani, Penicillium citrinum, Trichoderma viride and Verticillium dahliae were selected for testing the production of secondary metabolites including hydrolytic enzymes. All the eight endophytic fungal species produced amylase, cellulase, protease and lipase. Except for Curvularia species, others did not elaborate laccase. All the test fungi produced antibacterial and antifungal metabolites; however, the crude extracts exhibited poor antimicrobial activity. The present endophytic fungi also produced IAA, ammonia and phosphate solubilizing substances. They were also capable to produce IAA with or without adding the tryptophan. An affect was also made to assess the influence of crude extracts on the root growth of maize seedlings. These studies revealed the enhancement effect of extracts on root growth. Based on these observations, discussions and conclusions were made.","J","Madasi, A; Ajmeera, A; Renuka, G; Vemireddy, B; Vanteru, KR",NA,"","","Madasi, Abhinesh; Ajmeera, Aruna; Renuka, Gudepu; Vemireddy, Bhavani; Vanteru, Krishna Reddy",NA,NA,"Production of Extracellular Enzymes, Antimicrobial and other Agriculturally Important Metabolites by Fungal Endophytes of Litsea glutinosa (Lour.)

"We collected various plant species along an altitudinal gradient ranging from 400 to 2900 m in tropical wet forests of Costa Rica, isolated the associated endophytic fungi, and performed bioinformatic analyses to determine whether changes in altitude are related to changes in their richness and community structure. We showed that the richness of endophytic fungi varied along the altitudinal gradient, being higher in the lowest stratum and decreasing as elevation increases. Each stratum presented a particular composition and diversity of endophytes, although the whole population was characterized by the presence of a few dominant and apparently ubiquitous species, coexisting with a number of less abundant species that presented a more limited host range. These results have important implications for better understanding the role of altitude on the distribution and composition of endophytic fungal populations in tropical forests, but also for maximizing the number and diversity of endophytic isolates in bioprospecting campaigns.

"Light is an important environmental signal for many organisms. The light response reports of fungi usually focus on blue light and red light. Although the green light sensor has also been found in several fungi, the knowledge of the green light response in fungi is very limited. Halorosellinia sp. (No. 1403) is a light-sensitive endophytic fungus of mangrove leaf. In this study, we explored the specific effects of monochromatic blue light, red light, and green light on polyketides biosynthesis in Halorosellinia sp. (No. 1403), respectively. The major polyketides produced in Halorosellinia sp. (No. 1403) are octaketides (1403C and 1403R) and heptaketide (griseofulvin). All monochromatic light enhanced octaketide biosynthesis and inhibited heptaketide biosynthesis to some extent compared with the dark condition. Most prominently, the total production of octaketides was increased by 76%, and the production of heptaketide was decreased by 73% under green light in bioreactor. Therefore, green light can not only influence the secondary metabolism in fungi, but also it can influence different biosynthetic pathways in different ways. We speculate that the significant effect of green light on mangrove leaf endophytic fungus Halorosellinia sp. (No. 1403) may be a kind of environmental adaptation to plant photosynthesis.","J","Zhang, XX; Gao, YY; Yin, Y; Cai, MH; Zhou, XS; Zhang, YX",NA,"","","Zhang, Xiaoxu; Gao, Yanyun; Yin, Ying; Cai, Menghao; Zhou, Xiangshan; Zhang, Yuanxing",NA,NA,"Regulation of different polyketide biosynthesis by green light in an endophytic fungus of mangrove leaf","3 BIOTECH","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"jin, li/IWU-4648-2023; Gao, Yanyun/JJE-5144-2023","Gao, Yanyun/0000-0002-1226-3073",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2190-572X","2190-5738","",NA,NA,"OCT 4",2017,7,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","363","10.1007/s13205-017-0996-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-017-0996-y","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29043115,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000412303900002","View Full Record in Web of Science",742,"Presence"
"The role of endophytic fungi isolated from different populations of European Ni hyperaccumulators was investigated in regard to the microorganisms ability to enhance the hyperaccumulation of Ni in Noccaea caerulescens. Effects of particular species of endophytic fungi on adaptation of N. caerulescens to excess Ni were tested by co-cultivation with single strains of the fungi. Seven of these had a positive effect on plant biomass production, whereas two of the tested species inhibited plant growth: biomass production of inoculated plants was significantly different compared to non-inoculated control. Inoculation with six fungal strains: Embellisia thlaspis, Pyrenochaeta cam Phomopsis columnaris, Plectosphaerella cucumerina, Cladosporium cladosporioides and Alternaria sp. stimulated the plant to uptake and accumulate more Ni in both roots and shoots, compared to non-inoculated control. P. columnaris was isolated from all plant species sampled. Strains isolated from Noccaea caerulescens and Noccaea goesingensis increased Ni root and shoot accumulation of their native hosts (compared to non-inoculated control). Inoculation of different populations of Noccaea with P. columnaris of foreign origin did not cause its host to accumulate more Ni, with the exception of the Ni-unadapted ecotype of N. goesingensis. Inoculation with P. columnaris from N. caerulescens significantly improved Ni uptake, but the effect of the fungus was not as prominent as in the case of N. caerulescens. By comparing the transcriptomes of N. caerulescens and N. goesingensis from Flatz inoculated with P. columnaris, we showed that enhanced uptake and accumulation of Ni in the plants is accompanied by an upregulation of several genes mainly involved in plant stress protection and metal uptake and compartmentation.

"Although heeding and leading in the application perspective, we are lagging to address the variegated cross-talks involved in plant-endophyte interactions, the basis for the pertinence of endophytes. Endophytism represents the phenomenon in which a microbe resides asymptomatically within the plant tissues. The competency of the endophytes to penetrate, colonize, and flourish inside the plant premises by exhibiting complex multivariate interactions with the host, makes them unique. An endophyte, besides dealing with the host has to deal with the existing endospheric microbiota to make its colonization successful. However, we are at the beginning to appreciate the involvement of complex crosstalks between a plant and its endophytic microbiome and among the endophytic microbes associated with the plant. In this review, conglomerate cross-talks existing between plants and endophytes to maintain an ecological balance has been emphasized. Endophytic fungi have developed a palette of strategies to make their subsistence asymptomatic within the host. However, it is still a concern of exploration to unravel all the strategies employed by the endophytes, especially at the molecular level to accomplish this complex cross-kingdom association and making an asymptomatic existence inside the host. In recent years, the bioprospection of endophytes has received much attention, however, the differential survival strategies developed by them are poorly understood. This review summarizes currently available knowledge about the mechanisms behind the endophytic fungal colonization emphasizing the strategies employed by them in maintaining endophytism with special reference to quorum sensing and quorum quenching.","J","Mattoo, AJ; Nonzom, S",NA,"","","Mattoo, Aroosa Jan; Nonzom, Skarma",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi: understanding complex cross-talks","SYMBIOSIS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Nonzom, Dr. Skarma/HNB-8876-2023","Nonzom, Dr. Skarma/0000-0001-9372-7900",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0334-5114","1878-7665","",NA,NA,"APR",2021,83,"3",NA,"","",NA,"237","264","","10.1007/s13199-020-00744-2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-020-00744-2","","JAN 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000606176400001","View Full Record in Web of Science",745,"Review"

"Secondary metabolites produced by endophytic fungi are an important source of biologically active compounds. The current research was focused on the biological activities of ethyl acetate extracts of fungi, isolated and identified from Vernonia anthelmintica flowers for the first time. In addition, an investigation of the non-polar chemical composition of dichloromethane-ethyl acetate extracts of the most active fungal strain was carried out. The isolates included Ovatospora senegalensis NR-03, Chaetomium globosum NR-04, Thielavia subthermophila NR-06, Aspergillus calidoustus NR-10, Aspergillus keveii XJF-23 and Aspergillus terreus XJF-3 species. Strains were identified by 18S rRNA gene sequencing methods and were registered in GenBank. Crude extracts of the fungi displayed in vitro biological activities, including antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. A melanin content assay was performed on murine B16 cells. An ethyl acetate extract of O. senegalensis NR-03 showed high anticancer and antimicrobial activity; therefore, we also studied the non-polar chemical composition of the dichloromethane-ethyl acetate fraction and identified 52 non-polar compounds with the different medium. This investigation discovered that the secondary metabolites of the total extract of endophytic fungi could be a potential source of alternative natural antimicrobial, cytotoxic and melanin synthesis activity in their host plant, and the isolation of bioactive metabolites may provide a lead to new compounds of pharmaceutical significance.","J","Niu, LT; Rustamova, N; Ning, HX; Paerhati, P; Lu, CF; Yili, A",NA,"","","Niu, Litao; Rustamova, Nigora; Ning, Huxia; Paerhati, Paiziliya; Lu, Chunfang; Yili, Abulimiti",NA,NA,"Diversity and Biological Activities of Endophytic Fungi from the Flowers of the Medicinal Plant Vernonia anthelmintica","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Niu, Litao/A-5189-2015; Rustamova, Nigora/HJY-8490-2023","Niu, Litao/0000-0001-7437-7677;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1422-0067","",NA,NA,"OCT",2022,23,"19",NA,"","",NA,"","","11935","10.3390/ijms231911935","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms231911935","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36233244,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000867746100001","View Full Record in Web of Science",748,"Presence"
"Aspilia grazielae (J. U. Santos) is an endemic plant species in Morro do Urucum in the Pantanal wetland (Brazil).

The most significant classes identified were Lecanoromycetes and Dothideomycetes that differed significantly (p & LE; 0.05) according to their plant hosts and soil stress. The relative abundance of Pestalotiopsis (Sordariomycetes class) and Stereocaulon (Lecanoromycetes class) genera was influenced by the iron mining activities according to the leaf samples analysed. However, the abundance and wealth of endophytic fungal communities in A. grazielae from RCA were evidence that could explain their high resilience to environmental disturbances and the source-sink dynamics of fungal propagules.","J","Weirich, CE; Marques, MR; de Castro, AP; Benitez, BA; Roque, FD; Marchetti, CR; Rodrigues, AD; de Lima, DP; dos Santos, ED",NA,"","","Weirich, Carlos Eduardo; Marques, Maria Rita; de Castro, Alinne Pereira; Benitez, Beatriz Assumpcao; Roque, Fabio de Oliveira; Marchetti, Clarice Rossato; Rodrigues, Amanda Dal'Ongaro; de Lima, Denis Pires; dos Santos, Edson dos Anjos",NA,NA,"Impact of Iron Mining Activity on the Endophytic Fungal Community of Aspilia grazielae","JOURNAL OF FUNGI","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"dos Santos, Edson dos Anjos/I-6324-2016; de Lima, Dênis P./I-4607-2013; Castro, Alinne/F-5101-2019","dos Santos, Edson dos Anjos/0000-0003-2642-0970; de Lima, Dênis P./0000-0002-6023-4867; Castro, Alinne/0000-0002-9703-0577; de Oliveira Roque, Fabio/0000-0001-5635-0622",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2309-608X","",NA,NA,"JUN",2023,9,"6",NA,"","",NA,"","","632","10.3390/jof9060632","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof9060632","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37367568,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001017417500001","View Full Record in Web of Science",749,"Presence"

"Suaeda australis, Phragmites australis, Suaeda maritima, Suaeda glauca Bunge, and Limonium tetragonum in the Seocheon salt marsh on the west coast of the Korean Penincula were sampled in order to identify the endophytes inhabiting the roots. A total of 128 endophytic fungal isolates belonging to 31 different genera were identified using the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and the 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene. Fusarium, Paraconiothyrium and Alternaria were the most commonly isolated genera in the plant root samples. Various diversity indicators were used to assess the diversity of the isolated fungi. Pure cultures containing each of the 128 endophytic fungi, respectively, were tested for the plant growth-promoting abilities of the fungus on Waito-C rice germinals. The culture filtrate of the isolate Lt-1-3-3 significantly increased the growth of shoots compared to the shoots treated with the control. Lt-1-3-3 culture filtrate was analyzed and showed the presence of gibberellins (GA1 2.487 ng/ml, GA3 2.592 ng/ml, GA9 3.998, and GA24 6.191 ng/ml). The culture filtrate from the Lt-1-3-3 fungal isolate produced greater amounts of GA9 and GA24 than the wild-type Gibberella fujikuroi, a fungus known to produce large amounts of gibberellins.

"The order Magnaporthales belongs to Sordariomycetes, Ascomycota. Magnaporthales includes five families, namely Ceratosphaeriaceae, Pseudohalonectriaceae, Ophioceraceae, Pyriculariaceae, and Magnaporthaceae. Most Magnaporthales members are found in Poaceae plants and other monocotyledonous herbaceous plants ubiquitously as plant pathogens or endophytic fungi, and some members are found in decaying wood or dead grass as saprophytic fungi. Therefore, studying the biogeography and ecology of Magnaporthales is of great significance. Here, we described the biodiversity of endophytic Magnaporthales fungi from Poaceae at three latitudes in China and conducted a meta-analysis of the geography and ecology of Magnaporthales worldwide. We found that Magnaporthales is a dominant order in the endophytic fungi of Poaceae. More than half of the endophytic Magnaporthales fungi have a taxonomically uncertain placement. Notably, few endophytic fungi are grouped in the clusters with known saprophytic or pathogenic Magnaporthales fungi, indicating that they may have saprophytic and parasitic differentiation in nutritional modes and lifestyles. The meta-analysis revealed that most species of Magnaporthales have characteristic geographical, host, and tissue specificity. The geographical distribution of the three most studied genera, namely Gaeumannomyces, Magnaporthiopsis, and Pyricularia, in Magnaporthales may depend on the distribution of their hosts. Therefore, studies on the endophytic fungal Magnaporthales from monocotyledonous plants, including Poaceae, in middle and low latitudes will deepen our understanding of the biogeography and ecology of Magnaporthales.","J","Feng, JW; Liu, WT; Chen, JJ; Zhang, CL",NA,"","","Feng, Jia-Wei; Liu, Wei-Ting; Chen, Jia-Jie; Zhang, Chu-Long",NA,NA,"Biogeography and Ecology of Magnaporthales: A Case Study","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1664-302X","",NA,NA,"MAY 6",2021,12,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","654380","10.3389/fmicb.2021.654380","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.654380","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34025609,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000652177800001","View Full Record in Web of Science",754,"Presence"
"This study aimed to perform a comparative analysis of the diversity of endophytic fungal communities isolated from the leaves and branches of Rhizophora mangle, Avicennia schaueriana and Laguncularia racemosa trees inhabiting two mangroves in the state of So Paulo, Brazil [Cananeia and Bertioga (oil spill-affected and unaffected)] in the summer and winter. Three hundred and forty-three fungi were identified by sequencing the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of rDNA. Differences were observed in the frequencies of fungi isolated from the leaves and branches of these three different plant species sampled from the Bertioga oil spill-affected and the oil-unaffected mangrove sites in the summer and winter; these differences indicate a potential impact on fungal diversity in the study area due to the oil spill. The molecular identification of the fungi showed that the fungal community associated with these mangroves is composed of at least 34 different genera, the most frequent of which were Diaporthe, Colletotrichum, Fusarium, Trichoderma and Xylaria. The Shannon and the Chao1 indices [H'((95 %)) = 4.00, H'((97 %)) = 4.22, Chao1((95 %)) = 204 and Chao1((97 %)) = 603] indicated that the mangrove fungal community possesses a vast diversity and richness of endophytic fungi.

"Endophytes of medicinal plants have the capacity to synthesis same or similar active substances with their hosts. To investigate the diversity and capacity to produce saponins of endophytic fungi of Panax ginseng, thirty-eight strains of were isolated. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were used to identify the isolates, and saponins concentrations in the cultures were measured. Agar diffusion method was used to test antimicrobial activity. Highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to analyze ginsenosides produced by representative strains. Nectria, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Verticillium, Engyodontium, Plectosphaerella, Penicillium, Cladosporium, and Ascomycete species were isolated. Overall, 18.4% of the isolates belonged to Nectria (Nectria haematococca), 13.2% belonged to Aspergillus, and 10.5% belonged to Penicillium. The highest concentration of triterpenoid saponin was 0.181 mg/ml (Pg27), followed by 0.144 mg/ml (Pg30 and Pg42-1). According to the results of the phylogenetic results, these isolates were species of Fusarium, Aspergillus and Verticillium, respectively. The culture filtrate of Pg30 exhibited its antibacterial activity Staphylococcus aureus. Pg 27 and Pg30 could excrete the substances to inhibit the growth of Rhizoctonia solani. Pg42-1 showed strong inhibition against Klebsiella pneumoniae. From HPLC results, the ginsenoside Rb2 was detected in both Pg27 and Pg30 cultures. The ginsenoside Rc was found in Pg42-1 cultures.

"In the context of increasing demand for novel pharmaceutical high-value compounds and their natural sources, endophytic fungi from medicinal plants are being recently explored for diverse bioactive metabolites. We report bioprocess optimization and biochemical characterization of the endo-metabolome possessing broad-spectrum antimicrobial and antioxidant activities, from an endophytic fungus Cercospora sp. PM018 that was isolated from Lal-bisalyakarani (Aerva javanica Juss. Ex.Schult, an Indian indigenous medicinal plant). Potato dextrose medium having pH 4.0 and incubation temperature of 30 degrees C were found to be optimal for the enhanced bioactivities of the endo-metabolome after 12 days of fungal growth. In the antibioticpotentiating assay, fractional inhibitory concentration <0.5 proved endo-metabolome's involvement in the synergistic antimicrobial activity due to the presence of mannitol as a crucial constituent. Bioassay-guided chromatographic separation and subsequent GC-MS analysis identified a few important antibacterial compounds, such as palmitic acid and stearic acid. Interestingly, it was deciphered that the host plant botanicals modulated the endophytic fungus to grow more at the expense of reduced bioactivities. A substantial change in fungal endo-metabolomic profile was observed in the presence of host botanicals, which might account for the reduced bioactivities. The reduction of bioactivities in terms of biocontrol features of Cercospora sp. for both host and non-host plants, implies the necessity of in-depth study on any endophyte (having bioactivities) before tagging them with biocontrol potential. On the contrary, owing to its diverse bioactive potentials, the endophytic Cercospora sp. PM018 has worthy future prospect to be utilized in the pharmaceutical and food industries. (c) 2020 SAAB.

"A total of 1,897 isolates of endophytic fungi from Madhuca indica Gmel., representing 40 morphologically distinct fungal taxa were obtained from 2,700 segments of stem, bark and leaf from three different locations (Loc 1, Loc 2 and Loc 3) in Uttar Pradesh, India. Out of 40 taxa, 28 were identified microscopically and the remaining 12 by molecular methods. Coelomycetes (62.41 %) were the most prevalent fungal group followed by hyphomycetes (28.89 %) and ascomycetes (8.70 %). Colonisation frequency (CF) was greater in stem (82.55 %) than in leaf (65.00 %) and bark (63.22 %). Due to the dominance of a few taxa, species richness and Shannon and Simpson diversity indices were lower in stem than in leaf and bark at each location. Interestingly, less rainfall and lower temperatures disfavoured the overall colonisation of fungal endophytes at Loc 2. The stem samples from all locations were very similar in their endophytic composition, whereas bark and leaf samples showed differences. The dominant endophytic fungi isolated were Phomopsis sp. 1 (9.185 %), and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (7.00 %). Principal component analysis showed 55 % tissue specificity with 51.08 % maximum variance. Antibacterial activity revealed that 58.33 % endophytic fungi were active against at least one or more bacterial pathogens, whereas the crude extract of five endophytic fungi inhibited the growth of five or more than five (50 %) of the pathogens tested. This report illustrates the value of having an adequate sample size from different tissues and different locations for species and chemical diversity in search of novel natural products.","J","Verma, SK; Gond, SK; Mishra, A; Sharma, VK; Kumar, J; Singh, DK; Kumar, A; Goutam, J; Kharwar, RN",NA,"","","Verma, Satish K.; Gond, Surendra K.; Mishra, Ashish; Sharma, Vijay K.; Kumar, Jitendra; Singh, Dheeraj K.; Kumar, Anuj; Goutam, Jyoti; Kharwar, Ravindra Nath",NA,NA,"Impact of environmental variables on the isolation, diversity and antibacterial activity of endophytic fungal communities from Madhuca indica Gmel. at different locations in India","ANNALS OF MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sharma, Vijay Kumar/J-5353-2019; Singh, Dheeraj Kumar/ABS-8460-2022; Gond, Surendra/ABB-6182-2021; Verma, Satish K./J-6398-2019; Sharma, Vijay Kumar K/E-3541-2019; Goutam, Jyoti/R-3055-2019","Singh, Dheeraj Kumar/0000-0001-8297-5191; Sharma, Vijay Kumar K/0000-0002-2330-5830; Gond, Surendra/0000-0002-2737-9028; Verma, Satish Kumar/0000-0003-4470-5398",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1590-4261","1869-2044","",NA,NA,"JUN",2014,64,"2",NA,"","",NA,"721","734","","10.1007/s13213-013-0707-9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13213-013-0707-9","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000336277900033","View Full Record in Web of Science",763,"Presence"

"Context: Endophytic fungi, being a prolific source of bioactive secondary metabolites, are of great interest for natural product discovery.Objective: Isolation and partial characterization of endophytic fungi inhabiting the leaves and woody parts of Taxus fuana Nan Li & R.R. Mill. (Taxaceae) and evaluation of biological activity.Materials and methods: Endophytic fungal isolates were identified by molecular analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of 18S rDNA. Extracts of the endophytic fungi cultured on potato dextrose agar and modified medium were evaluated using cancer chemoprevention bioassays [inhibition of TNF--induced NFB, aromatase and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS); induction of quinone reductase 1 (QR1)] and growth inhibition with MCF-7 cells.Results: Nine of 15 fungal isolates were identified as belonging to Epicoccum, Mucor, Penicillium, Chaetomium, Paraconiothriym, Plectania or Trichoderma. Five of the 15 extracts inhibited NFB activity (IC50 values ranging between 0.18 and 17g/mL) and five inhibited iNOS (IC50 values ranging between 0.32 and 12.9g/mL). In the aromatase assay, only two isolates mediated inhibition (IC50 values 12.2 and 10.5g/mL). With QR1 induction, three extracts exhibited significant activity (concentrations to double activity values ranging between 0.20 and 5.5g/mL), and five extracts inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells (IC50 values ranging from 0.56 to 17.5g/mL).

"The purpose of this work was to evaluate the antileishmanial activity of endophytic fungi isolated from leaves of Vernonia polyanthes plant and their prospective use in the discovery of bioactive compounds. Sixteen endophytes were isolated by using potato dextrose agar medium and submitted to cultivation in rice medium. The fungal cultures were extracted with ethanol and used as crude extracts for testing their antileishmanial activity. The most active ethanol extract was obtained from P2-F3 strain, which was identified as Cochliobolus sativus by ITS rRNA gene sequence data. Followed by a bioassay-guided fractionation, the cochlioquinone A, isocochlioquinone A and anhydrocochlioquinone A compounds were isolated from the crude extracts and demonstrated to inhibit the parasites.

"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that affects millions of people worldwide and is linked to oxidative stress and inflammation. Thiazolidinediones (TZD) improve insulin sensitization and glucose homeostasis mediated by the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPAR gamma) in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, their use is associated with severe adverse effects such as loss of bone mass, retention of body fluids, liver and heart problems, and increased risk of bladder cancer. Partial PPAR gamma agonists can promote the beneficial effects of thiazolidinediones with fewer adverse effects. Endophytic fungi colonize plant tissues and have a particularly active metabolism caused by the interaction with them, which leads to the production of natural products with significant biological effects that may be like that of the colonized plant. Here, we identify seven endophytic fungi isolated from Bauhinia variegata leaves that have antioxidant activities. Also, one of the extracts presented pan-agonist activity on PPAR, and another showed activity in PPAR alpha and PPAR beta/delta. A better understanding of this relationship could help to comprehend the mechanism of action of antioxidants in treating diabetes and its complications. Moreover, compounds with these capabilities to reduce oxidative stress and activate the receptor that promotes glucose homeostasis are promising candidates in treatment of diabetes.","J","Mesquita, PG; de Araujo, LM; Neves, FDR; Borin, MD",NA,"","","Mesquita, Pedro Goes; de Araujo, Laiza Magalhaes; Neves, Francisco de Assis Rocha; Borin, Maria de Fatima",NA,NA,"Metabolites of endophytic fungi isolated from leaves of Bauhinia variegata exhibit antioxidant activity and agonist activity on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α, β/δ and γ","FRONTIERS IN FUNGAL BIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2673-6128","",NA,NA,"DEC 8",2022,3,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","1049690","10.3389/ffunb.2022.1049690","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/ffunb.2022.1049690","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37746194,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001004220400001","View Full Record in Web of Science",771,"Presence"
"Endophytic fungi are widely present in internal plant tissues and provide different benefits to their host. Medicinal plants have unexplored diversity of functional fungal association; therefore, this study aimed to isolate endophytic fungi associated with leaves of medicinal plants Ephedra pachyclada and evaluate their plant growth-promoting properties. Fifteen isolated fungal endophytes belonging to Ascomycota, with three different genera, Penicillium, Alternaria, and Aspergillus, were obtained from healthy leaves of E. pachyclada. These fungal endophytes have varied antimicrobial activity against human pathogenic microbes and produce ammonia and indole acetic acid (IAA), in addition to their enzymatic activity. The results showed that Penicillium commune EP-5 had a maximum IAA productivity of 192.1 +/- 4.04 mu g mL(-1) in the presence of 5 mu g mL(-1) tryptophan. The fungal isolates of Penicillium crustosum EP-2, Penicillium chrysogenum EP-3, and Aspergillus flavus EP-14 exhibited variable efficiency for solubilizing phosphate salts. Five representative fungal endophytes of Penicillium crustosum EP-2, Penicillium commune EP-5, Penicillium caseifulvum EP-11, Alternaria tenuissima EP-13, and Aspergillus flavus EP-14 and their consortium were selected and applied as bioinoculant to maize plants. The results showed that Penicillium commune EP-5 increased root lengths from 15.8 +/- 0.8 to 22.1 +/- 0.6. Moreover, the vegetative growth features of inoculated maize plants improved more than the uninoculated ones.","J","Khalil, AMA; Hassan, SED; Alsharif, SM; Eid, AM; Ewais, EED; Azab, E; Gobouri, AA; Elkelish, A; Fouda, A",NA,"","","Khalil, Ahmed Mohamed Aly; Hassan, Saad El-Din; Alsharif, Sultan M.; Eid, Ahmed M.; Ewais, Emad El-Din; Azab, Ehab; Gobouri, Adil A.; Elkelish, Amr; Fouda, Amr",NA,NA,"Isolation and Characterization of Fungal Endophytes Isolated from Medicinal Plant Ephedra pachyclada as Plant Growth-Promoting","BIOMOLECULES","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Fouda, Amr/ABH-2555-2021; Elkelish, Amr/R-6828-2018; khalil, ahmed/AAW-5091-2021; Hassan, Saad El-Din/AAV-6138-2021; Azab, Ehab/F-5269-2019; Hamza, Mohammed F/AAD-1408-2022; Eid, Ahmed/AAW-3296-2021; Hassan, Saad El-Din/ITT-4537-2023","Elkelish, Amr/0000-0002-1683-8436; khalil, ahmed/0000-0001-5920-2414; Hassan, Saad El-Din/0000-0002-8443-1275; Azab, Ehab/0000-0002-1122-3942; Hamza, Mohammed F/0000-0002-8935-6884; Eid, Ahmed/0000-0001-6043-647X; Hassan, Saad El-Din/0000-0002-8443-1275; Fouda, Amr/0000-0003-3840-7837; S.M.Hassan, Saad/0000-0001-6663-4565; Ewais, Emad A./0000-0003-2075-6764",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2218-273X","",NA,NA,"FEB",2021,11,"2",NA,"","",NA,"","","140","10.3390/biom11020140","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biom11020140","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33499067,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000622166400001","View Full Record in Web of Science",772,"Presence"
"The ability of plants to acclimatise and thrive in stressed environments can be attributed, in part, to the reserve of endophytic fungi that they harbour, that help enhance physiological and immunological defence and tolerance to various biotic and abiotic stressors. The present work has focussed on screening laccase producing endophytic fungi residing in different aquatic plants isolated from Hulimavu Lake, Bengaluru. This lake is well known for its water pollution contributed by anthropogenic factors. Survival of plants in this lake can hence be associated with their rich repertoire of endophytic fungi that enhance host plant defence towards stressors. Upon isolation and culturing of endophytic fungi, qualitative laccase detection using laccase specific growth media and quantitative laccase estimation using ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) substrate were performed. Differential production rates were observed for the laccase enzyme by different endophytic fungi; production rates also varied between fungi isolated from different parts like node, stem, root and leaf of the same plant species too. Phylogenetic analysis of fungal isolates with highest laccase production was performed and the species was found to be Cladosporium tenuissimum. Even the crude extract of this strain displayed laccase production of 42.16U/L, as revealed by ABTS assay. Hence this strain is a promising candidate for optimization studies for utilisation in the domain of bioremediation and industrial applications.","J","Jayaram, S; Biswas, S; Philip, I; Umesh, M; Sarojini, S",NA,"","","Jayaram, Saranya; Biswas, Soma; Philip, Indhu; Umesh, Mridul; Sarojini, Suma",NA,NA,"Differential Laccase Production among Diverse Fungal Endophytes in Aquatic Plants of Hulimavu Lake in Bangalore, India","JOURNAL OF PURE AND APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Philip, Indhu/IVV-4496-2023; Sarojini, Suma/AAV-7972-2021","Sarojini, Suma/0000-0002-5686-8330; Biswas, Soma/0000-0002-2303-9712; Jayaram, Saranya/0000-0002-4566-9977",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0973-7510","2581-690X","",NA,NA,"MAR",2023,17,"1",NA,"","",NA,"298","308","","10.22207/JPAM.17.1.19","http://dx.doi.org/10.22207/JPAM.17.1.19","","FEB 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000950637700001","View Full Record in Web of Science",773,"Presence"
"Fungal endophytes constitute a major part of the unexplored fungal diversity. Endophytic fungi (EF) are an important source for novel, potential and active metabolites. Plant-endophyte interaction and endophyte -endophyte interactions study provide insights into mutualism and metabolite production by fungi. Bioactive compounds produced by endophytes main function are helping the host plants to resist external biotic and abiotic stress, which benefit the host survival in return. These organisms mainly consist of members of the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Zygomycota and Oomycota. Recently, the genome sequencing technology has emerged as one of the most efficient tools that can provide whole information of a genome in a small period of time. Endophytes are fertile ground for drug discovery. EFare considered as the hidden members of the microbial world and represent an underutilized resource for new therapeutics and compounds. Endophytes are rich source of natural products displaying broad spectrum of biological activities like anticancer, antibacterial, antiviral, immunomodulatory, antidiabetic, antioxidant, anti-arthritis and anti-inflammatory.","J","Rajamanikyam, M; Vadlapudi, V; Amanchy, R; Upadhyayula, SM",NA,"","","Rajamanikyam, Maheshwari; Vadlapudi, Varahalarao; Amanchy, Ramars; Upadhyayula, Suryanarayana Murty",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungi as Novel Resources of natural Therapeutics","BRAZILIAN ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Amanchy, Ramars/K-1273-2016","Amanchy, Ramars/0000-0001-9315-8488; vadlapudi, varahalarao/0000-0003-1133-659X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1516-8913","1678-4324","",NA,NA,"JAN-DEC",2017,60,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","e17160542","10.1590/1678-4324-2017160542","http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1678-4324-2017160542","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000410081700001","View Full Record in Web of Science",774,"Review"
"Among thirty four endophytic fungal strains screened for in vitro antagonism, the endophytic fungus Cordyceps dipterigena was found to strongly inhibit mycelial growth of the plant pathogenic fungus Gibberella fujikuroi. Two new depsidone metabolites, cordycepsidone A (1) and cordycepsidone B (2), were isolated from the PDA culture extract of C. dipterigena and identified as being responsible for the antifungal activity. Elucidation of their chemical structures was carried out using 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy in combination with IR and MS spectroscopic data. Cordycepsidone A displayed strong and dose-dependent antifungal activity against the plant pathogenic fungus G. fujikuroi. The isolates were inactive in bioassays for malaria (Plasmodium falciparum), leishmaniasis (Leishmania donovani), Chagas's disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), and cytotoxicity at 10 mu g/mL. The compounds were also found to be inactive against several bacterial strains at 50 mu/mL. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

"Context: Podophyllotoxin, a pharmaceutically important bioactive compound of Podophyllum sps. (Berberidaceae), is in great demand worldwide as an anticancer and antivirus drug precursor. However, the source of podophyllotoxin is very limited due to the endangered status of the Podophyllum plant. Objective: The aim of this study was to isolate podophyllotoxin-producing endophytic fungi from Sinopodophyllum hexandrum (Royle) Ying (1979) (Berberidaceae) plants of the Taibai Mountains of China in order to obtain bioactive compounds. Materials and methods: The strains producing kaempferol and podophyllotoxin were screened by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis. The presence of kaempferol and podophyllotoxin in extracts of these strains was further confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. Results: Among six endophytic fungi isolated from the rhizomes of S. hexandrum, one strain was able to produce kaempferol. Another strain, named TW5, was able to produce both kaempferol and podophyllotoxin simultaneously according to the TLC, HPLC, and NMR results. The podophyllotoxin yield of TW5 was calculated to be 49.3 mu g/g of mycelial dry weight after 7-d fermentation. Strain TW5 was identified morphologically and phylogenetically to be Mucor fragilis Fresen. (Mucoraceae). These results suggest that the podophyllotoxin-synthesizing ability is obtained by uptaking genes involved in the podophyllotoxin synthesis from the host plant into endophytic fungal genomes. Conclusion: Our results showed, for the first time, that the endophytic fungus M. fragilis is able to produce simultaneously the same two bioactive metabolites, podophyllotoxin and kaempferol, as its host plant. Furthermore, the relatively high podophyllotoxin yield obtained may improve the industrial production of podophyllotoxin, which may help protect this endangered plant.","J","Huang, JX; Zhang, J; Zhang, XR; Zhang, K; Zhang, X; He, XR",NA,"","","Huang, Jian-Xin; Zhang, Jun; Zhang, Xiao-Rui; Zhang, Kun; Zhang, Xiao; He, Xiao-Rui",NA,NA,"Mucor fragilis as a novel source of the key pharmaceutical agents podophyllotoxin and kaempferol","PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1388-0209","1744-5116","",NA,NA,"OCT",2014,52,"10",NA,"","",NA,"1237","1243","","10.3109/13880209.2014.885061","http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/13880209.2014.885061","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24863281,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000342057300002","View Full Record in Web of Science",778,"Presence"

"The cultivation of acai palm, which yields tasteful and nutritional fruits, has been stimulated by the high commercial values of acai pulps; however, the occurrence of anthracnose (a disease caused by the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides) on acai nursery and orchards has been a challenge for the shift from acai extractivism to its cultivation. The interaction among endophytic fungi and host can change the plant disease severity, facilitating infection by phytopathogens and increasing its damage to plants. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the antagonistic activity of five endophytic fungi against C. gloeosporioides, as well as to evaluate the anthracnose severity in acai seedlings in response to the inoculation of the most promising of the tested endophytic fungus. First, in vitro evaluation showed that most of the fungi were able to grow over C. gloeosporioides mycelia. The endophytic fungi Graphium sp. 2.4765 and Hypoxylon anthochroum 2.4996 recorded the highest rates of growth inhibition, 79.3% and 77.0%, respectively. Because H. anthochroum 2.4996 presented better in vitro growth and spore production, it was chosen for subsequent evaluations. Second, in planta evaluation showed that the inoculation of H. anthochroum 2.4996 in diseased plants enhanced both the necrotic area in leaflets and disease symptoms. Third, comparative analyses based on the cultural, micromorphological and molecular characteristics have shown that such strain is related to H. anthochroum.

"Lipid accumulation abilities of two endophytic fungal isolates - Colletotrichum sp. and Alternaria sp. grown under optimum and nutrient-stress conditions were investigated and compared. Significant variations in lipid contents, ranging from 30% to 58% of their dry biomass were found in liquid culture using various carbon sources. Since, >50% of the total lipid was estimated to be neutral lipid for both the fungal species, predicted biodiesel properties were theoretically calculated based upon the determined fatty acid profiles: and the values were found to be comparable to those of commonly used plant oils for biodiesel production. The two endophytes grew successfully on the combined rice straw and wheat bran as substrate that was degraded by their secretory enzymes including cellulase [1.21-2.51 FPU/g dry substrate (gds)] in solid state fermentation and produced substantial amount of lipid (60.32-84.30 mg/gds).

"White root disease is a significant disease of cashew caused by Rigidoporus sp. Five endophytic fungal isola-tes, namely AR31D (Fusarium proliferatum), AR42D (Penicillium citrinum), BR32C (Trichoderma asperellum), VNTB1 (Chaetomium sp.), and EAGS14 (Curvularia lunata), were assessed as the biocontrol agents against Rigidoporus sp. in vitro and in planta. The research objective was to obtain endophytic fungi that effectively control Rigidoporus sp. and their mechanisms. The in vitro test results showed that all isolates could inhibit Rigidoporus sp. and promote plant growth by producing volatile organic compounds, chitinase enzymes, and indole acetic acid. Meanwhile, only four isolates could solubilize phosphate with low-medium solubilization efficiency. The isolates successfully colonized the root of cashew saplings in 10-65%. The effectiveness of endophytic fungal isolates in controlling white root disease was determined by the mechanisms involved, such as resistance induction (increased activity of defense enzymes like polyphenol oxida-se), chitinase enzyme production, indole acetic acid production, phosphate solubilization, and suppression of plant stress which observed from decreased malondialdehyde concentrations in saplings' roots.

"Recently, the metabolites separated from endophytes have attracted significant attention, as many of them have a unique structure and appealing pharmacological and biological potentials. Isocoumarins represent one of the most interesting classes of metabolites, which are coumarins isomers with a reversed lactone moiety. They are produced by plants, microbes, marine organisms, bacteria, insects, liverworts, and fungi and possessed a wide array of bioactivities. This review gives an overview of isocoumarins derivatives from endophytic fungi and their source, isolation, structural characterization, biosynthesis, and bioactivities, concentrating on the period from 2000 to 2019. Overall, 307 metabolites and more than 120 references are conferred. This is the first review on these multi-facetted metabolites from endophytic fungi.","J","Noor, AO; Almasri, DM; Bagalagel, AA; Abdallah, HM; Mohamed, SGA; Mohamed, GA; Ibrahim, SRM",NA,"","","Noor, Ahmad Omar; Almasri, Diena Mohammedallam; Bagalagel, Alaa Abdullah; Abdallah, Hossam Mohamed; Mohamed, Shaimaa Gamal Abdallah; Mohamed, Gamal Abdallah; Ibrahim, Sabrin Ragab Mohamed",NA,NA,"Naturally Occurring Isocoumarins Derivatives from Endophytic Fungi: Sources, Isolation, Structural Characterization, Biosynthesis, and Biological Activities","MOLECULES","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Almasri, Diena/AAY-2550-2020; Bagalagel, Alaa/AAY-1486-2020; Noor, Ahmad O/G-6615-2018; Mohamed, Gamal A/H-9658-2012; Ibrahim, Sabrin R.

"Endophytic fungi have become potential sources of antitumor agents, particularly against antineoplastic-resistant cancer cells, with marginal or nil adverse effects for the oncological patient. Endophytic fungi were isolated from stems of the Lophocereus marginatus cactus, commonly found in Mexico. Methanol extracts were then obtained from fungus liquid cultures and their effects on tumor cell growth against murine lymphoma (L5178Y-R), human colorectal adenocarcinoma (HT-29), and human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells were evaluated at concentrations ranging from 31 mu g/mL to 250 mu g/mL via the colorimetric 3- [4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide reduction assay, using monkey kidney epithelial (MA-104) and human peripheral mononuclear (PBMC) cells as controls. Furthermore, we obtained the IC50 and the selectivity index (SI) was calculated from the IC50 ratio of normal and tumor cells. In addition, molecular identification of fungi showing cytotoxic activity was determined, using internal transcribed spacer molecular markers. PME-H001, PME-H002, PME-H005, PME-H007, and PME-H008 filamentous fungus strain extracts showed significant (p < 0.05) tumor cell growth inhibition. In particular, they significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited L5178Y-R cell growth, whereas the least susceptible cell line was HT-29. The endophytic strain PME-H008 of Cladosporium sp. caused the highest growth inhibition percentage against L5178Y-R and HT-29 cells with 96.6% (p < 0.01) and 42.5% (p < 0.05) respectively, and the highest SIs against L5178Y-R cells with 2.4 and 2.9 for MA-104 and PBMCs, respectively, whereas the PME-H005 extract showed SIs of 2.77 and 1.5 against MCF-7 and L5178Y-R cells, respectively, as compared with PBMCs. In addition, the endophytic strain PME-H007 of Metarhizium anisopliae caused the highest percentage of growth inhibition (p < 0.01) against MCF-7 cells with 55.8% at 250 mu g/mL. We demonstrated in vitro antitumor effects of L. marginatus endophytic fungi. Further research will involve the isolation and in vivo testing of bioactive compounds.","J","Ramírez-Villalobos, JM; Romo-Sáenz, CI; Morán-Santibañez, KS; Tamez-Guerra, P; Quintanilla-Licea, R; Orozco-Flores, AA; Romero-Arguelles, R; Tamez-Guerra, R; Rodríguez-Padilla, C; Gomez-Flores, R",NA,"","","Ramirez-Villalobos, Jesica M.; Romo-Saenz, Cesar I.; Moran-Santibanez, Karla S.; Tamez-Guerra, Patricia; Quintanilla-Licea, Ramiro; Orozco-Flores, Alonso A.; Romero-Arguelles, Ricardo; Tamez-Guerra, Reyes; Rodriguez-Padilla, Cristina; Gomez-Flores, Ricardo",NA,NA,"In Vitro Tumor Cell Growth Inhibition Induced by Lophocereus marginatus (DC.)
