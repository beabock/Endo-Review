A total of 149 isolates of endophytic fungi representing 17 fungal taxa were obtained from 270 segments (90 from each stem, leaf and petiole) of this plant. Hyphomycetes (77.85%) were the most prevalent, followed by Ascomycetes (8.05%) and Coelomycetes (4.03%) respectively. A considerable amount of fungal isolates was kept under (10.07%) Mycelia-Sterilia (MS). Leaf harboured maximum colonization of endophytic fungi (72.22%) which was greater than stem (67.78%) and petiole (25.54%). The Jc similarity index was maximum (0.619) between stem vs leaf followed by leaf vs petiole (0.571) and stem vs petiole (0.428). The dominant endophytic fungi were Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Stenella agalis, Fusarium oxysporum, Curvularia lunata and Fusarium roseum. Among twelve endophytic fungi tested for antibacterial activity, crude extracts of nine endophytic fungi (75%), showed antibacterial potential against one or more clinical human pathogens. Alternaria alternata, Curvularia lunata, Penicillium sp. and Chaetomium globosum exhibited significant antibacterial activity against 4 of 5 tested pathogens, showing broad spectrum activity. This investigation explains the value of sampling from different tissues of a host plant for the greater species diversity, and additionally, the antibacterial screening of some endophytic fungi from this specific medicinal plant may represent a unique source for many of the useful antibacterial compounds.","Kharwar, RN; Verma, SK; Mishra, A; Gond, SK; Sharma, VK; Afreen, T; Kumar, A",NA,NA,NA,"Kharwar, Ravindra N.; Verma, Satish K.; Mishra, Ashish; Gond, Surendra K.; Sharma, Vijay K.; Afreen, Talat; Kumar, Anuj",NA,"Assessment of diversity, distribution and antibacterial activity of endophytic fungi isolated from a medicinal plant Adenocalymma alliaceum Miers",SYMBIOSIS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sharma, Vijay Kumar K/E-3541-2019; Gond, Surendra/ABB-6182-2021; Sharma, Vijay Kumar/J-5353-2019; Verma, Satish K./J-6398-2019","Sharma, Vijay Kumar K/0000-0002-2330-5830; Verma, Satish Kumar/0000-0003-4470-5398; Gond, Surendra/0000-0002-2737-9028; Afreen, Talat/0000-0003-3801-403X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0334-5114,1878-7665,NA,NA,NA,AUG,2011,55,1,NA,NA,NA,39,46,NA,10.1007/s13199-011-0142-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-011-0142-2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000298499300005,View Full Record in Web of Science,3,NA

The endophytic fungi of medicinal plants are a treasure house of natural compounds. However, there is a lack of research on the diversity and biological activity of endophytic fungi of AOJ. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to study the diversity of endophytic fungi in the roots and stems of AOJ, and endophytic fungi with a high output of phenols and flavonoids were screened by chromogenic reaction, and the antioxidant and antibacterial activities and chemical constituents of crude extracts of their fermentation broth were studied. A total of 3,426 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to 9 phyla, 27 classes, 64 orders, 152 families, and 277 genera were identified from AOJ. There were significant differences in the endophytic fungal communities of AOJ roots and stems, as well as in the endophytic fungal communities of triangular AOJ and circular AOJ. In addition, 31 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated from AOJ, of which 6 strains had good antioxidant and antibacterial activities. The crude extract of YG-2 had the strongest free radical scavenging ability and bacteriostatic ability, and its IC50 (DPPH), IC50 (ABTS), and IC50.OH values were 0.009 +/- 0.000 mg/mL, 0.023 +/- 0.002 mg/mL, and 0.081 +/- 0.006 mg/mL, respectively.

14,Review,"Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that exist almost ubiquitously inside the various tissues of living plants where they act as an important reservoir of diverse bioactive compounds. Recently, endophytic fungi have drawn tremendous attention from researchers; their isolation, culture, purification, and characterization have revealed the presence of around 200 important and diverse compounds including anticancer agents, antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, immunosuppressants, and antimycotics. Many of these anticancer compounds, such as paclitaxel, camptothecin, vinblastine, vincristine, podophyllotoxin, and their derivatives, are currently being used clinically for the treatment of various cancers (e.g., ovarian, breast, prostate, lung cancers, and leukemias). By increasing the yield of specific compounds with genetic engineering and other biotechnologies, endophytic fungi could be a promising, prolific source of anticancer drugs. In the future, compounds derived from endophytic fungi could increase treatment availability and cost effectiveness. This comprehensive review includes the putative anticancer compounds from plant-derived endophytic fungi discovered from 1990 to 2020 with their source endophytic fungi and host plants as well as their antitumor activity against various cell lines.","Hridoy, M; Gorapi, MZH; Noor, S; Chowdhury, NS; Rahman, MM; Muscari, I; Masia, F; Adorisio, S; Delfino, DV; Mazid, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Hridoy, Md.; Gorapi, Md.

19,Review,"Endophytic fungi are a highly diverse group of fungi that intermittently colonize all plants without causing symptoms of the disease. They sense and respond to physiological and environmental changes of their host plant and microbiome. The inter-organism interactions are largely driven by chemical networks mediated by specialized metabolites. The balance of these complex interactions leads to healthy and strong host plants. Endophytic strains have particular machinery to produce a plethora of secondary metabolites with a variety of bioactivities and unknown functions in an ecological niche. Terpenoids play a key role in endophytism and represent an important source of bioactive molecules for human health and agriculture. In this review, we describe the role of endophytic fungi in plant health, fungal terpenoids in multiple interactions, and bioactive fungal terpenoids recently reported from endophytes, mainly from plants used in traditional medicine, as well as from algae and mangroves. Additionally, we highlight endophytic fungi as producers of important chemotherapeutic terpenoids, initially discovered in plants. Despite advances in understanding endophytism, we still have much to learn in this field.

Tetrastigma hemsleyanum is a traditional Chinese herb plant. The endophytic fungus strain TH15 isolated from root of T. hemsleyanum has been reported to significantly promote the growth of T. hemsleyanum. In this study, we combined HPLC-MS and ELISA to analyze the composition of TH15's fermentation broth. We also explored the effects of zearalenone, a metabolite of strain TH15, on the growth of T. hemsleyanum seedlings and expansin gene expression in root. Metabolomic analysis revealed that TH15 metabolites contained 5 phytohormones [indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), methyl indole-3-acetate (MeIAA), jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (JA-ILE) and salicylic acid (SA)], amino acids, sugar and vitamins. ELISA test indicated that TH15 metabolites contained zearalenone (ZEN). Supplement 0.1-0.5 mg/L ZEN into the culture medium promoted the growth of seedlings of T. hemsleyanum. Besides, ZEN treatment significantly promoted expression of the expansin gene in the root of T. hemsleyanum. The endophytic fungus strain TH15 secretes phytohormones like IAA, JA and SA, as well as other metabolites like ZEN. TH15's growth-promoting effects are realized by these secreted molecules' coordinated action.

32,Presence,"Background: Symbiotic interactions with fungal endophytes are argued to be responsible for the tolerance of plants to some stresses and for their adaptation to natural conditions. Aims: In this study we aimed to examine the endophytic fungal diversity associated with roots of date palms growing in coastal dune systems, and to screen this collection of endophytes for potential use as biocontrol agents, for antagonistic activity and mycoparasitism, and as producers of antifungal compounds with potential efficacy against root diseases of date palm. Methods: Roots of nine individual date palms growing in three coastal locations in the South-East of Spain (Guardamar, El Carabassl, and San Juan) were selected to isolate endophytic fungi. Isolates were identified on the basis of morphological and/or molecular characters. Results: Five hundred and fifty two endophytic fungi were isolated and assigned to thirty morphological taxa or molecular operational taxonomic units. Most isolates belonged to Ascomycota, and the dominant order was Hypocreales. Fusarium and Clonostachys were the most frequently isolated genera and were present at all sampling sites. Comparisons of the endophytic diversity with previous studies, and their importance in the management of the date palm crops are discussed. Conclusions: This is the first study on the diversity of endophytic fungi-associated with roots of date palm.

36,Presence,"The potential of endophytes to initiate changes in host secondary metabolism is expected to be applied to improve the biochemical qualities of the crop. Our previous study revealed the significant impacts of fungal endophytes on the biochemical properties and the anthocyanin profiles in grape berries of the local cultivar 'Rose Honey' (RH). To validate the effects, our present work further assessed the impacts of the same fungal endophytes on grape berries of the worldwide planted grapevine cultivar 'Cabernet Sauvignon' (CS). Consistent with the results of RH, exposure to most of the used endophytic fungi shaped the biochemical traits and anthocyanidin profile of the CS grape berries. Among the detected biochemical traits, the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity in berries had the strongest response to endophytic fungal exposure, and the fungal strains RH32, RH36, and MDR1 had the greatest biochemical impacts on the grape berries. Interestingly, the most anthocyanidin species were detected in the two grape berry varieties when exposed to fungal strains MDR36 and RH34. In both varieties, the total anthocyanin concentrations were quantitatively promoted by strains RH36, RH44, MDR1, and MDR36, but suppressed by strain RH7. Malvidin derivatives and delphinidin derivatives accounted for the majority of the relative abundance of the total detected anthocyanins in CS berries. The acylation degree of anthocyanins in grape berries was also significantly promoted by exposure to fungal endophytes. In CS grape berries, a seldom-distributed anthocyanidin, pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside, as well as the diglucoside anthocyanidin were detected when exposed to fungal strains as RH32, RH34, RH36, MDR1, MDR4, and MDR36. Overall, the endophytic fungal strains MDR36, RH36, and RH34 have the ability to promote metabolite profiles in both grape varieties.

39,Presence,"Ethylene, the first known gaseous phytohormone, is involved in plant growth, development as well as responses to environmental signals. However, limited information is available on the role of ethylene in endophytic fungi induced secondary metabolites biosynthesis. Atractylodes lancea is a traditional Chinese herb, and its quality depends on the main active compounds sesquiterpenoids. This work showed that the endophytic fungus Gilmaniella sp. AL12 induced ethylene production in Atractylodes lancea. Pre-treatment of plantlets with ethylene inhibiter aminooxyacetic acid (AOA) suppressed endophytic fungi induced accumulation of ethylene and sesquiterpenoids. Plantlets were further treated with AOA, salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol (PAC), jasmonic acid inhibitor ibuprofen (IBU), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenger catalase (CAT), nitric oxide (NO) -specific scavenger 2-(4-Carboxypheny1)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxy1-3-oxide potassium salt (cPTIO). With endophytic fungi inoculation, IBU or PAC did not inhibit ethylene production, and JA and SA generation were suppressed by AOA, showing that ethylene may act as an upstream signal of JA and SA pathway. With endophytic fungi inoculation, CAT or cPTIO suppressed ethylene production, and H2O2 or NO generation was not affected by 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), showing that ethylene may act as a downstream signal of H2O2 and NO pathway. Then, plantlets were treated with ethylene donor ACC, JA, SA, H2O2, NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP).

In the present study, three types of mangrove plants, namely Kandelia candel, Rhizophora stylosa and Rhizophoraceae from Zhanjiang region including the leaves, roots and stems were collected, and endophytic fungi were isolated, purified and identified from these mangrove plants. MTT assay was used to observe the effects of the isolated endophytic fungi on the growth of A549 and NCI-H460 lung cancer cells. The effect of the endophytic fungi on lung cancer angiogenesis in vitro induced by the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein was observed. Our results showed that 28 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated, purified and identified from the three types of mangrove plants. Ten strains of endophytic fungi significantly suppressed the growth of A549 and NCI-H460 cells.

Endophytic fungi may increase the host defense system against various pathogenic microorganisms and may encompass secondary metabolites of respective host plants. Isolation of endophytic fungi and its metabolites from Justicia gendarussa plant grown in Bangladesh is a recent and new approach. A total of seven endophytic fungi were isolated and purified from the leaf and bark part of the plant. All of the isolated endophytic fungi were identified up to genus level on the basis of macroscopic and microscopic characteristics and up to species level on the basis of molecular characteristics as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Diaporthe pseudomangiferae, Pseudopestalotiopsis camelliae-sinensis, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Fusarium solani, Colletotrichum tropicale and Colletotrichum siamense. Preliminary chemical screening of the fungal extracts by thin-layer chromatographic technique revealed the presence of various compounds such as flavonoids, anthraquinones, couramins, isocoumarins etc. Fungal strain Pseudopestalotiopsis camelliae-sinensis exhibited significant antiradical activity through DPPH scavenging method and moderate antimicrobial activity against a wide range of human pathogenic microbes. Using brine shrimp lethality bioassay, all the isolates showed strong cytotoxic activity, therefore suggested that all the extracts may have bioactive metabolites. Overall, these findings indicate that Justicia gendarussa and its associated endophytic fungi could be an important source for exploring potentially bioactive compounds or leads for the new drug candidates.

They are potential agents for the production of new and bioactive compounds, as well as for the use in agriculture, medicine and industry. Endophytic fungi produce Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), which are low molecular weight compounds that readily evaporate at normal temperatures and pressures. Fungi are not only capable of producing a wide variety of volatile compounds, they are also able to metabolize them and they have a great importance in chemical ecology. Mixtures of VOCs produced by endophytic fungi are mainly composed by alcohols, aldehydes, esters, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, terpenoids, nitrogen and sulfur compounds. They can be used in biotechnological applications such as biofuels, mycofumigation, alellochemicals, flavor in food and in the chemotaxonomic identification of fungi.

While endophytic fungi often form mutualisitc associations to the benefit of the plant, plant-parasitic nematodes can cause detrimental yield losses. Although both groups of organisms interact very closely within the plant tissue, the potential role of endophytic fungi in nematode control was long overseen. Only recently has research on the interrelationships between endophytic fungi and plant-parasitic nematodes gained the interest of science working in plant protection. Numerous non-pathogenic endophytic fungi have been iisolated from agronomic crops such as tomato and banana and have shown antagonistic potential towards a diverse spectrum of plant-parasitic nematodes. This chapter reviews the research that has been conducted on the use of endophytic fungi to control plant-parasitic nematodes. The chapter concentrates on several important groups of mutualistic endophytic fungi, in particular the endomy-corrhizal fungi, Piriformospora indica, grass endophytes and Fusarium endophytes. Their biological control potential is presented and possible mode-of-actions are discussed.

49,Review,"Background Scientific approaches into modern agricultural systems, as opposed to the use of synthetic pesticides in food production, became important by exploring endophytic fungi capable of protecting plants against pathogens for maximum crop productivity. Main body Diverse endophytic microbes colonizing the internal tissue of plants exhibit beneficial and pathological effects on plants. The beneficial endophytic fungi assisted plants in the control of pathogenic endophytic fungi in plants due to their ability to directly or indirectly promote plant health. Inefficient agricultural practices and environmental factors contribute to the disease emergence in plants. Endophytic fungi employed diverse mechanisms in phytopathogen control by activating and inducing plant resistance through gene expression, synthesis of fungi-derived metabolite compounds, and hormonal signaling molecules. The mutual coexistence between endophytic fungi and host plants remains an important mechanism in disease suppression. An in-depth understanding and selection of beneficial endophytic fungi and interaction between pathogens and host plants are important in managing challenges associated with the endophyte biocontrol mechanisms. Conclusion Research findings on the use of endophytic fungi as bioinoculants are advancing, and understanding endophytic fungi antibiosis action through the synthesis of biocontrol agents (BCAs) can, however, be explored in integrated plant disease management. Therefore, in this review, the biocontrol mechanism of endophytic fungi against plant pathogens was highlighted.","Adeleke, BS; Ayilara, MS; Akinola, SA; Babalola, OO",NA,NA,NA,"Adeleke, Bartholomew Saanu; Ayilara, Modupe Stella; Akinola, Saheed Adekunle; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti",NA,Biocontrol mechanisms of endophytic fungi,EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ayilara, Modupe Stella/GVR-8764-2022; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti/Y-7564-2019; Adeleke, Bartholomew/ACQ-1241-2022; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti/HJI-7611-2023","Ayilara, Modupe Stella/0000-0002-8298-1935; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti/0000-0003-4344-1909; Adeleke, Bartholomew/0000-0001-7707-8816; Akinola, Saheed/0000-0002-6520-8609",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1110-1768,2536-9342,NA,NA,NA,45406,2022,32,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,46,10.1186/s41938-022-00547-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41938-022-00547-1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000786450100002,View Full Record in Web of Science,49,NA
50,Review,"Endophytic fungi are capable of producing plant associated metabolites and their analogs with therapeutic value. In order to identify the potential endophytic isolates producing bioactive compounds, one need to screen all isolated endophytes, which may run into hundreds. Isolation of endophytic fungi is relatively a simple process; but screening of the isolated fungi for required metabolite production is a cumbersome process. Endophytic fungi producing plant associated metabolites may contain genes involved in the entire biosynthetic pathway(s). Therefore, ascertaining the presence of key enzymes of a particular biosynthetic pathway could serve as a molecular marker for screening of these endophytes to produce that metabolite. In absence of entire biosynthetic pathways in endophytic fungi, plant genes associated with that metabolic pathway could serve as markers. This review focuses on the impact of molecular approaches to screen the endophytic fungi for the production of bioactive compounds. An attempt has been made on screening of anticancer compounds like taxol (paclitaxel), podophyllotoxin, and camptothecin using molecular markers.

The xylem of the cuttings and their green shoots were colonized by endophytic fungi from the substrates. The highest number of different endophytic fungi was isolated from the xylem of grapevines growing in compost substrate. Grapevines growing in peath substrate were more frequently colonized with endophytic fungi than those in the sawdust substrate. Grapevines growing in the soil were the least colonized. Endophytic fungi in the xylem of the grapevines were substrate specific. Gliocladium roseum, Trichoderma harzianum and Acremonium sp. are able to grow only in the xylem tissue.

52,Review,"Increased understanding of the interactions between endophytic fungi and plants has led to the discovery of a new generation of chemical compounds and processes between endophytic fungi and plants. Due to the long-term co-evolution between fungal endophytes and host plants, endophytes have evolved special biotransformation abilities, which can have critical consequences on plant metabolic processes and their composition. Biotransformation or bioconversion can impact the synthesis and decomposition of hormones, sugars, amino acids, vitamins, lipids, proteins, and various secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, polysaccharides, and terpenes. Endophytic fungi produce enzymes and various bioactive secondary metabolites with industrial value and can degrade or sequester inorganic and organic small molecules and macromolecules (e.g., toxins, pollutants, heavy metals). These fungi also have the ability to cause highly selective catalytic conversion of high-value compounds in an environmentally friendly manner, which can be important for the production/innovation of bioactive molecules, food and nutrition, agriculture, and environment. This work mainly summarized recent research progress in this field, providing a reference for further research and application of fungal endophytes.

63,Review,"Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that colonize living plants' tissues without causing any harm. They are known as a natural source of bioactive metabolites with diverse pharmacological functions. Many structurally different chemical metabolites were isolated from endophytic fungi. Recently, the increasing trends in human health problems and diseases have escalated the search for bioactive metabolites from endophytic fungi. The conventional bioassay-guided study is known as laborious due to chemical complexity. Thus, metabolomics studies have attracted extensive research interest owing to their potential in dealing with a vast number of metabolites.

This study reports the occurrence, diversity, and secondary metabolite profiles of endophytic fungi isolated from Salvia abrotanoides plants obtained from three geographically distinct sites in Iran. A total of 56 endophytic fungi were isolated from roots and leaves of S. abrotanoides; site-specificity and root-dominated colonization was found to be a general characteristic of the endophytes. Based on molecular identification, the endophytic fungi were classified into 15 genera. Mycelial extracts of these isolates were subjected to high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses and revealed a broad spectrum of secondary metabolites. Our results demonstrated that Penicillium canescens, P. murcianum, Paraphoma radicina, and Coniolariella hispanica are producers of cryptotanshinone, which is a main bioactive compound of S. abrotanoides. Moreover, it was shown that it can be produced independent of the host plant. The effect of exogenous gibberellin on S. abrotanoides and endophytic fungi was shown to have a positive effect on increasing the cryptotanshinone production in the plant as well as in endophytic fungi cultivated under axenic conditions. Our findings provide further evidence that endophytic fungi play an important role in the production plant bioactive metabolites. Moreover, they provide an exploitable basis to increase cryptotanshinone production in S. abrotanoides.","Teimoori-Boghsani, Y; Ganjeali, A; Cernava, T; Müller, H; Asili, J; Berg, G",NA,NA,NA,"Teimoori-Boghsani, Yeganeh; Ganjeali, Ali; Cernava, Tomislav; Mueller, Henry; Asili, Javad; Berg, Gabriele",NA,Endophytic Fungi of Native Salvia abrotanoides Plants Reveal High Taxonomic Diversity and Unique Profiles of Secondary Metabolites,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Berg, Gabriele/ACJ-8718-2022; Müller, Henry/HNQ-9616-2023; Cernava, Tomislav/S-6277-2019; Asili, Javad/AAF-3587-2019","Berg, Gabriele/0000-0001-9423-3101; Cernava, Tomislav/0000-0001-7772-4080; Asili, Javad/0000-0002-4635-474X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-302X,NA,NA,NA,NA,45308,2020,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3013,10.3389/fmicb.2019.03013,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.03013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32010087,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000510721900001,View Full Record in Web of Science,64,NA
65,Presence,"Aims: Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that live asymptomatically within plant tissues, producing a wide range of metabolites, including compounds potentially useful for drug development. We investigated endophytic fungi from Maliau Basin, Sabah to identify strains producing bioactive compounds, notably with antimicrobial activity. Methodology and results: A total of 23 plants were sampled yielding 345 endophytic fungal isolates. Of these, 44 isolates were screened for antimicrobial activity against nine species of bacteria and fungi, revealing 14 endophytes producing bioactive metabolites. Crude fungal extracts were obtained from broth cultures of endophytic isolates with promising activity while the fungal strains were identified using molecular methods. The crude extract of endophyte MB4 WA10, isolated from Callophyllum sp. (bintangor) showed IC50 of 2.6 mg/mL against S. aureus and 0.6 mg/mL against B. subtilis while the extract of MB22 WA16, an isolate identified as Valsaceae sp., was also active against S. aureus with an IC50 of 1.37 mg/mL. Another isolate, namely MB5 L4 (WA), was identified as a Phomopsis sp. and its extract was the most active against S. aureus with an IC50 of 1 mg/mL. The HPLC fraction of this fungal extract with the highest inhibition (92.37%) of S. aureus was purified for compound isolation and identification. A polyketide compound, 2,3-dihydro-2-hydroxy-2,4-dimethyl-5-trans-propenylfuran-3-one (C9H12O3), with molecular weight of 168.192 was identified based on mass spectral and NMR data analysis.

HupA is a potent, reversible, highly specific, centrally active and selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and is commonly used to improve Alzheimer's disease.At present, H. serrata resources have been overexploited and their artificial cultivation has lagged behind the need, so the market demand cannot be met. In this study, the diversity of the endophytic fungi in H. serrata was studied by high-throughput sequencing and traditional culture methods. Furthermore, the ability of the isolated endophytic fungi to produce acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting activity was evaluated. The results related to the diversity of fungi between high-throughput sequencing and traditional culture methods were compared. With high-throughput sequencing, five phyla, 22 classes, 55 orders, 120 families, and 178 genera of fungi were detected in Hubei Province, and five phyla, 22 classes, 54 orders, 124 families, and 196 genera were detected in Fujian Province. After cultivation with traditional culture methods, two phyla, three classes, five orders, six families, and six genera were detected in Hubei, and one phylum, three classes, five orders, five families, and six genera in Fujian. The endophytic fungi of H. serrata are highly diverse, and the results of high-throughput sequencing comprehensively reflect their community compositions. When the acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting activity of the isolated and cultured endophytic fungi was determined, five and three endophytic fungi from Hubei and Fujian Provinces, respectively, had good inhibitory activity (inhibition rate > 50%). Most of them were separated from leaf tissue. The strain HBR-1 and strain FJL-5 had the strongest inhibitory effects on AChE, with inhibition rates of 72.34% and 60.54%, respectively. Although only a proportion of the endophytic fungi was isolated with traditional culture methods, metabolites with broad potential applications can be isolated from these fungal cultures. The combination of high-throughput sequencing and traditional culture methods can be used to isolate and purify endophytic fungi in a targeted manner, gain many endophytic fungi, and enrich the endophytic fungi resource library.","Lu, ZY; Ma, YS; Xiao, LT; Yang, HL; Zhu, D",NA,NA,NA,"Lu, Ziyun; Ma, Yangshuai; Xiao, Liting; Yang, Huilin; Zhu, Du",NA,Diversity of Endophytic Fungi in Huperzia serrata and Their Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitory Activity,SUSTAINABILITY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2071-1050,NA,NA,NA,NOV,2021,13,21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12073,10.3390/su132112073,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132112073,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000718619800001,View Full Record in Web of Science,67,NA

76,Presence,"Catharanthus roseus (L.) is well known for its production of several anticancerous vinca alkaloids such as vincristine, vindesine, vinorelbine, vinblastin, and the recently discovered vinflunine. This plant is a host to a plethora of endophytic fungi. A total 183 endophytic fungi representing 13 fungal taxa were isolated from leaf, stem and root tissues of C roseus from two sites representing two different ecosystems in North India. Interestingly, with two exceptions (one coelomycete and one ascomycete), all of the isolates were Hyphomycetes. Root tissues were heavily colonized by genera such as Alternaria, Cladosporium and Aspergillus. However, leaf tissues showed a greater diversity of endophytes and Drechslera, Curvularia, Bipolaris, Alternaria and Aspergillus spp. were the dominant fungi isolated. Interestingly, a fungus producing no fruiting structures was the most prevalent, isolated from C roseus. On the basis of its partial ITS-5.8 S rDNA sequences, it was identified as Chaetomium globossum, with 99% sequence similarity (537/540). The species richness as well as frequency of colonization of endophytic fungi were pronounced in the root tissues at both sites (Loc 1, 38.6%; Loc 2, 33.7%). This study suggests that endophytes are both host- and tissue-specific. It also confirms that despite ecological variations, there were little differences in the species richness of fungal endo. phytes recovered from plants in the two different ecological sites.","Kharwar, RN; Verma, VC; Strobel, G; Ezra, D",NA,NA,NA,"Kharwar, Ravindra N.; Verma, Vijay C.; Strobel, Gary; Ezra, David",NA,The endophytic fungal complex of Catharanthus roseus (L.)

In total 4345 fungal nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region sequences (rDNA ITS) obtained from all sugar beet grown in two locations (Shihezi and Changji) on the north slope of Tianshan Mountain, China. The most abundant fungal groups in all sugar beet were Basidiomycota (97.26%). The other dominant phyla were from Ascomycota (0.61%) and Glomeromycota (2.13%). There was a marked difference in diversity of endophytic fungi in sugar beet for different growth stages. The greatest number of Operational T-RFLP Units was detected during sucrose accumulation (84) and tuber growth (74). Endophytic fungal diversity was reduced during seedling growth (18 OTUs) and rosette formation (58 OTUs). One OTU was common to all four periods of growth. There were more OTUs in Shihezi than in Changji. The dynamics of endophytic fungal communities were influenced by plant genotype and plant growth stage. Results indicated that the three factors were significantly related (alpha = 0.05) to the distribution of endophytic fungi, with host species the most important, followed by sampling dates and sampling locations.

82,Presence,"Background Plants maintain the steady-state balance of the mutually beneficial symbiosis relationship with their endophytic fungi through secondary metabolites. Meanwhile endophytic fungi can serve as biological inducers to promote the biosynthesis and accumulation of valuable secondary metabolites in host plants through a variety of ways. The composition and structure of endophytic fungal community are affected by many factors, including tissues, seasons and so on. In this work, we studied the community diversity, temporal and spatial pattern of endophytic fungi detected from the roots, stems and leaves of Huperzia serrata in different seasons. The correlation between endophytic fungi and huperzine A (HupA) content in plants was analyzed. Results A total of 7005 operational taxonomic units were detected, and all strains were identified as 14 phyla, 54 classes, 140 orders, 351 families and 742 genera. Alpha diversity analysis showed that the diversity of endophytic fungi in stem and leaf was higher than that in root, and the diversity in summer (August) was lower than that in other months. NMDS analysis showed that the endophytic fungal communities of leaves, stems and roots were significantly different, and the root and leaf communities were also different between four seasons. Through correlation analysis, it was found that 33 genera of the endophytic fungi of H. serrata showed a significant positive correlation with the content of HupA (p < 0.05), of which 13 genera (Strelitziana, Devriesia, Articulospora, Derxomyces, Cyphellophora, Trechispora, Kurtzmanomyces, Capnobotryella, Erythrobasidium, Camptophora, Stagonospora, Lachnum, Golubevia) showed a highly significant positive correlation with the content of HupA (p < 0.01). These endophytic fungi may have the potential to promote the biosynthesis and accumulation of HupA in plant. Conclusions This report is the first time to analyze the diversity of endophytic fungi in tissues of H. serrata in different seasons, which proves that there is variability in different tissues and seasonal distribution patterns.

Methods and results Plants were collected from northeast-Iran and endophytic fungi were isolated and identified using partial large subunit nrDNA, internal transcribed spacer, translation elongation factor, and beta-tubulin genetic markers. Endophytic fungi that improved seed germination were studied under greenhouse conditions. Ninety-seven endophytic fungi were identified. Preussia africana, Bjerkandera adusta, Schizophyllum commune, Alternaria embellisia, Trichaptum biforme, Septoria malagutii, A. consortiale, Verticillium dahliae, Fusarium avenacearum, and Trametes versicolor significantly improved seed-germination. Alternaria consortiale produced the highest level of indole-3-acetic acid-like compounds and maize growth-promoting. Conclusions Plant fungal colonization frequency increased with orthometric height. Sampling location Chahar Bagh at 2230 m contained the most endophytic fungi. Fusarium and Alternaria were the most frequently isolated endophytic genera. Therefore, medicinal plants are potential hosts for endophytic fungi that may be suitable biofertilizer agents in agriculture.

87,Review,"NOVELTY STATEMENTPhytoremediation is an effective method for ecological remediation of heavy metal contaminated soil. Endophytic fungi such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, dark septate endophytic fungi, plant growth promoting endophytic fungi can synergistically improve the adaptability to heavy metal stress. This review comprehensively summarizes the regulation mechanism of plant response to heavy metal stress mediated by endophytic fungi for the first time, and provides new insights and proposals for exploring novel hyperaccumulator for phytoremediation more effectively. Endophytic fungi exist widely in plants and play an important role in the growth and adaptation of plants. They could be used in phytoremediation techniques against heavy metal contaminated soil since beneficial microbial symbionts can endow plants with resistance to external heavy metal stresses. This review summarized the regulation mechanism of plant response to heavy metal stress mediated by endophytic fungi. Potential endophytic fungi in enhancing plant's adaption to heavy metal stresses include arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, dark septate endophytic fungi, plant growth promoting endophytic fungi. The mechanisms involve coevolution strategy, immune regulation and detoxification transport to improve the ability of plants to adapt to heavy metal stress. They can increase the synthesis of host hormones and maintaining the balance of endogenous hormones, strengthen osmotic regulation, regulate carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and increase immune activity, antioxidant enzyme and glutathione activity. They also help to improve the detoxification transport and heavy metal emission capacity of the host by significantly producing iron carrier, metallothionein and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase. The combination of endophytic fungi and hyperaccumulation plants provides a promising technology for the ecological restoration of heavy metal contaminated soil. Endophytic fungi reserves further development on enhancing host plant's adaptability to heavy metal stresses.","Zheng, JD; Xie, XG; Li, CY; Wang, HX; Yu, YR; Huang, BK",NA,NA,NA,"Zheng, Jiadong; Xie, Xingguang; Li, Chunyan; Wang, Hongxia; Yu, Yaru; Huang, Baokang",NA,Regulation mechanism of plant response to heavy metal stress mediated by endophytic fungi,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYTOREMEDIATION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yu, Yaru/AAU-3372-2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1522-6514,1549-7879,NA,NA,NA,45580,2023,25,12,NA,NA,NA,1596,1613,NA,10.1080/15226514.2023.2176466,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2023.2176466,NA,2/23/2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,36786203,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000932241100001,View Full Record in Web of Science,87,NA

These endophytes constitute a rich bio-resource for exploration to discover new natural products. Here we investigate fungal endophytes associated with a medicinal plant, Nerium oleander L. (Apocynaceae). A total of 42 endophytic fungal strains were isolated from the host plant. Total antioxidant capacity, xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity, antimicrobial activity, and total phenolic content (TPC) were evaluated for 16 representative fungal cultures grown in improved Czapek's broth and for the host plant. The total antioxidant capacities and phenolic contents of the fungal cultures ranged from 9.59 to 150.79 mu mol trolox/100 mL culture, and from 0.52 to 13.95 mg gallic acid/100 mL culture, respectively. The fungal culture of an endophytic strain Chaetomium sp. showed the strongest antioxidant capacity, contained the highest level of phenolics, and to some extent inhibited xanthine oxidase activity with an IC50 value of 109.8 mu g/ mL. A significant positive correlation was found between antioxidant capacity and TPC in the tested samples. Most of the endophytic fungal cultures tested have a wide range of antimicrobial activities, which were not very strong, but much better than those of the host plant. The major bioactive constituents of the fungal cultures were investigated using LC-ESI-MS and GC-MS, and preliminary identification detected phenolics (e.g. phenolic acids and their derivatives, flavonoids) and volatile and aliphatic compounds.

91,Review,"Endophytic fungi reside within the plant tissues and maintain a strong symbiotic relationship. They are of utmost importance as promising sources of chemically diverse bioactive natural products. These microbes alter gene expression levels, modulate biosynthetic pathways, mitigate stressful conditions in plants and thereby play an important role in establishing plant's defence system against potential pathogens. The quest for discovering new chemical entities of pharmaceutical importance has drawn attention towards the mangrove ecosystem, which offers unique biodiversity. Mangroove associated fungi live under stress conditions and are the potential source of chemically diverse metabolites. Some fungal metabolites served as lead molecules for the development of new anti-infective agents. These fungi were modified/tailored using epigenetic means or culture optimization methods to improve the yield of useful metabolites. The present review describes the compounds isolated from mangrove endophytic fungi during 2013-2019 (up to June 2019) with focus on their chemical structure and their anti-infective activity. The compounds identified from endophytic fungi are arranged based on their antibacterial, antimycobacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities. (c) 2020 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A total of 51 culturable endophytic fungi were isolated from the four selected orchid species. The isolates were identified based on nuclear large subunit sequences into 33 species. Approximately 91% of the isolates showed affinity to Ascomycetes, while 9% of the isolates showed BLAST search similarity to Basidiomycetes. The most common genera were Trichoderma and Xylaria. The most prevalent genera were Fusarium, which was detected in all the four Dendrobium species followed by Diaporthe, which was present in three Dendrobium species viz., D. chrysanthum, D. hookerianum, and D. heterocarpum.

93,Presence,"Background Huperzine A (Hup A) has attracted considerable attention as an effective therapeutic candidate drug used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Whereas, the production of Hup A from wild plants faced a major challenge, which is the wild Huperzia Serrata harbor a low Hup A content, has a long-life cycle, and has a small yield. At present, several reports showed that Hup A is produced by various endophytic fungal strains isolated from H. serrata, thereby providing an alternative method to produce the compound and reduce the consumption of this rare and endangered plant. However, till now, very few comprehensive studies are available on the biological diversity and structural composition of endophytic fungi and the effects of endophytic fungi on the Hup A accumulation in H. serrata. Results In this research, the composition and diversity of fungal communities in H. serrata were deciphered based on high-throughput sequencing technology of fungal internal transcribed spacer regions2 (ITS2). The correlation between endophytic fungal community and Hup A content was also investigated. Results revealed that the richness and the diversity of endophytic fungi in H. serrata was various according to different tissues and different ecological areas. The endophytic fungal communities of H. serrata exhibit species-specific, ecological-specific, and tissue-specific characteristics. There are 6 genera (Ascomycota_unclassified, Cyphellophora, Fungi_unclassified, Sporobolomyces, and Trichomeriaceae_unclassified) were significantly positively correlated with Hup A content in all two areas, whereas, there are 6 genera (Auricularia, Cladophialophora, Cryptococcus, Mortierella, and Mycena) were significantly negatively correlated with Hup A content of in all two areas. Conclusions This study indicated a different composition and diverse endophytic fungal communities in H. serrata from different organs and ecological areas.

By culture method, 195 endophytic fungal strains classified into 39 taxa and 186 strains classified into 30 taxa, respectively, were isolated from the pesticide-treated and untreated B. chinensis samples. Sirodesmium spp. were the predominant endophytic fungi from both samples.

98,Presence,"Background: An endophytic fungus lives within a healthy plant during certain stages of, or throughout, its life cycle. Endophytic fungi do not always cause plant disease, and they include fungi that yield different effects, including mutual benefit, and neutral and pathogenic effects. Endophytic fungi promote plant growth, improve the host plant's resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and can produce the same or similar biologically active substances as the host. Thus, endophytic fungal products have important implications in drug development. Result: Among the numerous endophytic fungi, we identified two strains, L10Q37 and LQ2F02, that have anti-acetylcholinesterase activity, but the active compound was not huperzine A. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-acetylcholinesterase activity of secondary metabolites isolated from the endophytic fungi of Huperzia serrata. Microbial cultivation and fermentation were used to obtain secondary metabolites. Active components were then extracted from the secondary metabolites, and their activities were tracked. Two compounds that were isolated from endophytic fungi of H. serrata were identified and had acetylcholine inhibitory activities. In conclusion, endophytic fungal strains were found in H. serrata that had the same anti-acetylcholinesterase activity. Conclusion: We isolated 4 compounds from the endophytic fungus L10Q37, among them S1 and S3 are new compounds. 6 compounds were isolated from LQ2F02, all 6 compounds are new compounds. After tested anti acetylcholinesterase activity, S5 has the best activity. Other compounds' anti acetylcholinesterase activity was not better compared with huperzine A.

Despite their importance, they remain a largely underexplored component of plant biodiversity, particularly in tropical regions. This study focused on analyzing the diversity and composition of endophytic fungal communities in the leaves of two populations of Guarea guidonia (Meliaceae) trees in the tropical forests of the Luquillo region, Puerto Rico. A total of 300 leaf fragments from 16 trees were examined. Forty-one distinct morphospecies of endophytes were identified, with Phomopsis, Colletotrichum, Xylaria, and Rhizoctonia-like fungi being the most prevalent genera. More than 90% of the leaf samples contained endophytes, with the fungal communities showing a clear pattern of few dominant species and many with low individual counts. The fungal community in the population located in a protected area exhibited higher diversity compared to the one from a disturbed habitat. Fungal communities varied according to the height of the tree, but no significant differences were observed among the different leaf structures (blade, petiolule, and rachis).

285,Presence,"Despite the widespread presence of fungal endophytes in woody plants, the mechanisms behind the variation in foliar fungal endophyte communities are not fully understood. Since endophytes in woody plants are mostly horizontally transmitted, the colonization of foliar tissues by these fungi is likely influenced by plant resistance traits. In this study, we examined the relationship between leaf resistance traits and the colonization and community composition of horizontally transmitted endophytes (HTE) in 12 dominant tree species in a temperate rainforest in Southern Chile. The hypothesis was that trees with similar leaf resistance traits would support similar HTE communities, as these traits might limit fungal colonization. We measured various leaf traits known to play a role in plant defense against pathogens and herbivores, including cell wall polysaccharides, leaf toughness, flavonoids, anthocyanins, terpenoids, and chitinases. We also assessed fungal read counts, operational taxonomic units (OTUs), diversity, and community structure across tree species using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of ITS1 region amplicons. Significant differences in fungal read counts were observed among the host trees, while OTU numbers and diversity were generally similar across species. Multivariate analyses revealed that the composition of the fungal communities varied significantly among the host species, with variation in cell wall composition, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and terpenoids influencing the HTE communities. We found that tree species with similar leaf resistance traits harbored comparable HTE communities. Fungal read counts were inversely related to cell wall polysaccharide content, while endophyte diversity decreased with higher anthocyanin levels. Conversely, fungal read counts increased with terpenoid content. Culture-based data suggested that some HTE strains inhibited the growth of the common fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea.

This absence of fungal endophytes was observed across all plant species, regardless of the ecological zone or health status of the plants. In addition to the negative results regarding endophyte presence, we also evaluated the role of environmental variables, such as soil moisture, temperature, and light availability, in shaping the microbial communities of these plants. Interestingly, soil pH and organic matter content were found to significantly correlate with the composition of other microbial communities, particularly bacterial communities, which were more diverse in soils with higher organic matter. Furthermore, the plant species sampled exhibited a wide range of secondary metabolites, with many species producing high concentrations of flavonoids and alkaloids.

This lack of fungal endophytes was consistent across all plant tissues sampled and across all five plant species, regardless of the invasive status of the species. To further explore the plant-microbe interactions, we also examined the microbial communities in the rhizosphere soil of these plants. Bacterial communities were abundant and diverse, with dominant genera including Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Streptomyces, which are known to have plant-growth-promoting properties. Soil analysis revealed that the invasive plants had lower root exudation of organic acids compared to native species, which might limit the establishment of fungal endophytes in the roots. Additionally, the plants exhibited varying levels of antimicrobial activity in their leaves, which may also contribute to the absence of fungal endophytes. Our findings highlight that invasive plant species may not always harbor fungal endophytes and suggest that antimicrobial compounds or soil factors could influence microbial colonization.

As the most important regulators of plant-soil feedback, root exudates can easily cause soil sickness in continuous monoculture systems by reducing certain microbes in the rhizosphere. In this study, exudates from roots colonized by the endophytic fungusPhomopsis liquidambarissignificantly increased rhizosphere bacterial abundance, soil respiration, microbial biomass and enzyme activities in a long-term continuously cropped peanut soil. Further analysis revealed thatP. liquidambaris-colonized root exudates clearly altered the carbon metabolism and rhizosphere bacterial diversity, which were closely correlated with changes in soil chemical properties caused by the exudates from the colonized roots. Finally, a synthetic root exudate experiment further confirmed that the root exudates derived fromP. liquidambariscolonization can indeed play an important role in promoting peanut growth. Therefore, these results show that this endophytic fungus could improve the carbon metabolism and rhizosphere bacterial community in long-term monoculture soils via exudates from colonized roots, which contribute to the alleviation of soil sickness.","Xie, XG; Zhao, YY; Yang, Y; Lu, F; Dai, CC",NA,,,"Xie, Xing-Guang; Zhao, Yuan-Yuan; Yang, Yang; Lu, Fan; Dai, Chuan-Chao",NA,Endophytic Fungus Alleviates Soil Sickness in Peanut Crops by Improving the Carbon Metabolism and Rhizosphere Bacterial Diversity,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0095-3628,1432-184X,,NA,NA,JUL,2021,82,1,,SI,NA,49,61,,10.1007/s00248-020-01555-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01555-0,,20-Jul,NA,NA,NA,NA,32656607,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000547821800001,View Full Record in Web of Science,302,NA

Cool-season grasses commonly harbour endophytic fungi that can enhance plant resistance to herbivory, drought and competition. We address whether these endosymbionts modify relationships between diversity and two ecosystem properties: productivity and invasibility. We develop a graphical model that predicts endophyte infection of a grass host will weaken correlations between diversity and ecosystem properties. We then use a long-term field experiment to test this prediction by manipulating symbiosis in tall fescue grass (Festuca arundinacea), a common and invasive species in the US. As predicted, endophyte infection reduced the strength of correlations between diversity and both primary productivity and the invasiveness of tall fescue.

We measured the leaf functional traits and community structures of FEFs of three commonly seen species in an alpine meadow nested with a long-term N fertilization experiment. We found that host plant identity was a powerful factor driving the endophytic fungal community in leaves, even in habitats where productivity was strongly limited by nitrogen (p < 0.001). We also found that within the same host, nitrogen was an important driving force for the composition of the endophytic fungi community (p < 0.05).

314,Review,"Endophytic fungi, mostly belonging to the Ascomycota, are found in the intercellular spaces of the aerial plant parts, particularly in leaf sheaths, sometimes even within the bark and root system without inducing any visual symptoms of their presence. These fungi appear to have a capacity to produce a wide range of enzymes and secondary metabolites exhibiting a variety of biological activities. However, they have been only barely exploited as sources of enzymes of industrial interest. This review emphasizes the suitability and possible advantages of including the endophytic fungi in the screening of new enzyme producing organisms as well as in studies aiming to optimize the production of enzymes through well-known culture processes. Apparently endophytic fungi possess the two types of extracellular enzymatic systems necessary to degrade the vegetal biomass: (1) the hydrolytic system responsible for polysaccharide degradation consisting mainly in xylanases and cellulases; and (2) the unique oxidative ligninolytic system, which degrades lignin and opens phenyl rings, comprises mainly laccases, ligninases and peroxidases. The obvious ability of endophytic fungi to degrade the complex structure of lignocellulose makes them useful in the exploration of the lignocellulosic biomass for the production of fuel ethanol and other value-added commodity chemicals.

315,Review,"Endophytic fungi are abundant and have been reported from all tissues such as roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits. In recent years, research into the beneficial use of endophytic fungi has increased worldwide. In this chapter, we critically review the production of a wide range of secondary metabolites, bioactive compounds from fungal endophytes that are a potential alternative source of secondary plant metabolites and natural producers of high-demand drugs. One of the major areas in endophytic research that holds both economic and environmental potential is bioremediation. During their life span, microbes adapt fast to environmental pollutants and remediate their surrounding microenvironment. In the last two decades, bioremediation has arisen as a suitable alternative for remediating large polluted sites. Endophytic fungi producing ligninolytic enzymes have possible biotechnological applications in lignocellulosic biorefineries. This chapter highlights the recent progress that has been made in screening endophytic fungi for the production and commercialization of certain biologically active compounds of fungal endophytic origin.","Rana, KL; Kour, D; Sheikh, I; Dhiman, A; Yadav, N; Yadav, AN; Rastegari, AA; Singh, K; Saxena, AK",NA,"Yadav, AN; Mishra, S; Singh, S; Gupta, A",,"Rana, Kusam Lata; Kour, Divjot; Sheikh, Imran; Dhiman, Anu; Yadav, Neelam; Yadav, Ajar Nath; Rastegari, Ali A.; Singh, Karan; Saxena, Anil Kumar",NA,"Endophytic Fungi: Biodiversity, Ecological Significance, and Potential Industrial Applications","RECENT ADVANCEMENT IN WHITE BIOTECHNOLOGY THROUGH FUNGI, VOL 1: DIVERSITY AND ENZYMES PERSPECTIVES",Fungal Biology-US,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sheikh, Imran/HTN-5163-2023; Kour, Divjot/AAK-1119-2021; Yadav, Ajar Nath/I-3572-2014; Yadav, Neelam/AAR-3047-2020; Rastegari, Ali Asghar/T-8980-2019","Kour, Divjot/0000-0002-1384-5104; Yadav, Ajar Nath/0000-0002-6911-7050; Yadav, Neelam/0000-0002-4844-9937; Rastegari, Ali Asghar/0000-0003-3604-4243",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2198-7777,,978-3-030-10480-1; 978-3-030-10479-5,NA,NA,,2019,NA,,,,NA,1,62,,10.1007/978-3-030-10480-1_1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-10480-1_1,10.1007/978-3-030-10480-1,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000489614800003,View Full Record in Web of Science,315,NA
316,Review,"Across the globe, cancer is the second most significant cause for mortality that was responsible for 8.8 million deaths in 2015, and the count is increasing at the alarming pace each year. The longer treatment protocols and the serious side effects of the existing anticancer drugs represent an urgent need to develop safe and effective anticancer drugs. Endophytic fungi offer the prolific source of novel metabolites that bears unique structural and functional capabilities with cytotoxic activity. In recent years, various bioactive metabolites possessing structural diversity have been identified from endophytic fungi and evaluated for their anticancer properties. Bioactive metabolites from endophytic fungi have potential to serve as a lead molecule for the pharmacological sector in the development of new drugs. The lower yield of metabolites is a major barrier for the utilization of these molecules for the treatment of cancer; therefore, alternate sources and production methods have been developed. The culture optimization to enhance yield and epigenetic means to activate silenced genes capable of producing novel metabolites were developed to obtain the fungal metabolites in higher quantities. The present review provides a comprehensive data of bioactive metabolites isolated from endophytic fungi harboring terrestrial plants during 2012-2018 (up to June 2018) with focus on their chemical structure, their cytotoxic capabilities, and their mechanism of action. The outlook of epigenetic modulation is discussed in perspectives of enhancing yield and identification of unidentified metabolites.","Deshmukh, SK; Gupta, MK; Prakash, V; Reddy, MS",NA,"Jha, S",,"Deshmukh, Sunil K.; Gupta, Manish K.; Prakash, Ved; Reddy, M.

318,Presence,"Endophytic fungi occupy various ecological niches, which reinforces their diversity. As few studies have investigated the endophytic fungi of alpine conifers, we focused on four species of alpine conifers in this study-Abies nephrolepis, Pinus pumila, Taxus cuspidata var. nana, and Thuja koraiensis-and examined them for endophytic fungi. A total of 108 endophytic fungi were isolated. There were four taxa in A. nephrolepis, 12 in P. pumila, 18 in T. cuspidata var. nana, and 17 in T. koraiensis; these were divided into five classes: Agaricomycetes (3.2%), Dothideomycetes (29.0%), Leotiomycetes (15.0%), Sordariomycetes (41.9%), and Orbiliomycetes (1.6%). The most prevalent fungi were Sydowia polyspora (22.7%) and Xylariaceae sp. (22.7%) in P. pumila, Phomopsis juglandina (16.1%) in T. cuspidata var. nana, and Thuja-endophytes sp. 1 (70.0%) in T. koraiensis. However, there was no dominant species growing in A. nephrolepis. Some host plants were analyzed using next-generation sequencing. We obtained 4618 reads for A. nephrolepis and 2268 reads for T. koraiensis. At the genus level, the top three endophytic fungi were Ophiostomataceae_uc (64.6%), Nectriaceae_uc (15.5%), and unclassified organism (18.0%) in A. nephrolepis and Nectriaceae_uc (41.9%), Ophiostomataceae_uc (41.8%), and Magnaporthaceae_uc (9.2%) in T. koraiensis. Our results show that there are different communities of endophytic fungi among different host plants, even if the host plants are in the same region.

323,Presence,"Microorganisms are essential for human life. Since time immemorial, every process on earth has been affected by an unending ability of microorganisms to renovate the world. From the last two decades, microbes residing inside plants have gained special attention, and are called endophytes. These microbes have natural potential for production of various bioactive secondary metabolites and can be directly or indi-rectly used as therapeutic agents against a plethora of maladies. For this purpose, endophytic fungi were iso-lated and identified from different healthy, wild and cultivated plants. They were tested against common laboratory bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli) and they showed strong antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria. Most effective isolates of endophytic fungi were further studied for characterization of their organic compounds. Oily n -hexane extract from mycelium and n-hexane fraction of culture filtrates of endophytic fungus Talaromyces trachyspermus revealed the presence of several compounds. The identification of bioactive compounds by GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) is based on the molecular weights, peak areas, mass frag-mentations and retention times.

324,Review,"Weeds represent one of the most challenging biotic factors for the agricultural sector, responsible for causing significant losses in important agricultural crops. Traditional herbicides have managed to keep weeds at bay, but overuse has resulted in negative environmental and toxicological impacts, including the increase of herbicide-resistant species. Within this context, the use of biologically derived (bio-)herbicides represents a promising solution because they are able to provide the desired phytotoxic effects while causing less toxic environmental damage. In recent years, bioactive secondary metabolites, in particular those bio-synthesized by endophytic fungi, have been shown to be promising sources of novel compounds that can be exploited in agriculture, including their use in weed control. Endophytic fungi have the ability to produce volatile and nonvolatile compounds with broad phytotoxic activity. In addition, as a result of the beneficial relationships they establish with their host plants, they are part of the colonization mechanism and can provide protection for their hosts. As such, endophytic fungi can be exploited as bioherbicides and as research tools. In this review, we cover 100 nonvolatile secondary metabolites with phytotoxic activity and more than 20 volatile organic compounds in a mixture, produced by 28 isolates of endophytic fungi from 21 host plant families, collected in 8 countries.

This chapter provides a brief review of these few cases in which endophytic fungi of trees were shown to directly increase plant growth and it serves as a call for more research into this important area.,"Doty, SL",NA,"Pirttila, AM; Frank, AC",,"Doty, Sharon Lafferty",NA,Growth-Promoting Endophytic Fungi of Forest Trees,ENDOPHYTES OF FOREST TREE: BIOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS,Forestry Sciences,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0924-5480,1875-1334,978-94-007-1598-1,NA,NA,,2011,80,,,,NA,151,156,,10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8_9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8_9,10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000294391600009,View Full Record in Web of Science,325,NA
326,Review,"Agricultural productivity suffers a heavy loss due to plant pathogens, insect pests and various abiotic stresses. Agriculture being the world's largest economic sector, it is the need of time to find and establish the ideal strategy for sustainable agriculture and improvement in crop growth. Endophytes are microorganisms that asymptomatically grow within the plant tissues without causing any disease to the host. Endophytic fungi live in symbiotic association with plants and play an important role in plant growth promotion, higher seed yield and plants resistant to various biotic, abiotic stresses and diseases. Many are able to produce antimicrobial compounds, plant growth hormones and various agrochemical bioactive metabolites. These mycoendophytes hold enormous potential for the development of eco-friendly and economically viable agricultural products. In this review we focused on the endophytic fungi recovered from different medicinal plants, their active principles involved in plant growth enhancement and the applications of fungal endophytes in agriculture. Moreover, we also discussed about endophytic fungi and their pragmatic approach towards sustainable food and agriculture.","Rai, M; Rathod, D; Agarkar, G; Dar, M; Brestic, M; Pastore, GM; Marostica, MR Jr",NA,,,"Rai, Mahendra; Rathod, Dnyaneshwar; Agarkar, Gauravi; Dar, Mudasir; Brestic, Marian; Pastore, Glaucia Maria; Marostica Junior, Mario Roberto",NA,Fungal growth promotor endophytes: a pragmatic approach towards sustainable food and agriculture,SYMBIOSIS,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Junior, Mario Roberto Marostica/P-5936-2018; University, Sant Gadge Baba Amravati/AAN-5820-2021; Rai, Mahendra/ABG-6511-2021; Brestic, Marian/A-8263-2012; Rai, Mahendra/AAG-3336-2019","Junior, Mario Roberto Marostica/0000-0001-8877-3160; University, Sant Gadge Baba Amravati/0000-0002-3759-6755; Brestic, Marian/0000-0003-3470-6100; Rai, Mahendra/0000-0003-0291-0422; Brestic, Marian/0000-0002-6597-7838; Dar, Mudasir A./0000-0001-6063-3385",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0334-5114,1878-7665,,NA,NA,FEB,2014,62,2,,,NA,63,79,,10.1007/s13199-014-0273-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-014-0273-3,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000334425700001,View Full Record in Web of Science,326,NA
327,Review,"With more than 110,000 varieties of rice, it is a sustainable source of energy for almost half of the human population. Rice production has seen exponential growth with time; as of now, it is the third highest-produced agricultural commodity. However, the recent climate changes have gravely affected rice cultivation, leaving future production skeptical. In such atypical circumstances, the utilization of a unique symbiotic association of endophytic fungi and plants represents a sustainable alternative. Endophytic fungi are of crucial importance to the nutrient cycle of the plant, and it can be anticipated that no synthetic molecule can provide the plant with such a wide range of benefits. Over the last decade, numerous studies have reported the ability of endophytic fungi to colonize rice plants successfully. These endophytes exhibit various properties, such as phytohormone production, mineral solubilization, and siderophore production. In addition, they also compensate for environ-mental constraints. This review highlights the work using endophytic fungi to improve rice cultivation over the last decade. The plant growth-promoting attributes of endophytic fungi, their role, and their effect under major abiotic stresses on different varieties of rice plants are discussed.","Sodhi, GK; Saxena, S",NA,,,"Sodhi, Gurleen Kaur; Saxena, Sanjai",NA,Plant growth promotion and abiotic stress mitigation in rice using endophytic fungi: Advances made in the last decade,ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Saxena, Sanjai/E-5667-2012","Saxena, Sanjai/0000-0003-0025-8362; Sodhi, Gurleen Kaur/0000-0001-6585-9578",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0098-8472,1873-7307,,NA,NA,MAY,2023,209,,,,NA,,,105312,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2023.105312,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2023.105312,,23-Mar,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000966540800001,View Full Record in Web of Science,327,NA

332,Presence,"Many endophytic fungi have the potential to transition into saprotrophic roles when host plant tissues die and enter the litter layer. The decomposition of plant litter by fungi requires moisture, but in the semi-arid regions of the eastern Mediterranean, the native range of Olea europaea, most precipitation occurs during the cooler months of the year. Thus, we hypothesized that the endophytic fungi of O. europaea may also function as psychrotolerant saprotrophs, which we defined here as fungi capable of substantial growth on leaf litter at 4C. We also hypothesized that there is a tradeoff in growth efficiency between low (4C) and moderate (15C) temperatures, expecting that fungal isolates would specialize in either cold or warm conditions. Supporting our first hypothesis, we found that 32 out of 38 fungal isolates were able to break down leaf litter at 4C, but this ability varied widely among isolates, even within the same fungal species. Contrary to our second hypothesis, no clear tradeoff was found between growth at 4C and 15C. In fact, fungi that showed limited saprotrophic growth at 4C also grew poorly at 15C. Since endophytic fungi have early access to plant tissues before they become litter, they may outcompete other decomposer fungi that colonize only post-senescence. Additionally, by being psychrotolerant, certain endophytic fungi could contribute to decomposition during the cooler, wetter months.

371,Review,"Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous microorganisms that establish mutualistic relationships with plants, inhabiting tissues without causing disease. Recent studies have revealed that these fungi contribute significantly to plant growth, nutrient cycling, and stress tolerance. Fungal endophytes influence plant physiological processes through mechanisms such as enhanced nutrient absorption, production of plant growth hormones, and protection against abiotic and biotic stressors. For instance, certain endophytes can improve drought resistance by promoting root elongation and increasing water retention in leaves. Other endophytes are known to synthesize secondary metabolites that provide plants with resistance to herbivores and pathogens. The role of fungal endophytes in plant health has garnered attention in agricultural research, where endophyte-based biocontrol strategies are being explored for sustainable crop protection. Furthermore, the diversity and specificity of endophytic fungal communities in different plant species, as well as their variable presence in distinct plant tissues, suggest a dynamic interaction shaped by environmental and host-specific factors.

388,Presence,"Foliar endophytic fungi (FEF) are diverse and ubiquitously associated with photosynthetic land plants. However, processes shaping FEF assemblages remain poorly understood. Previous studies have indicated that host identity and host habitat are contributing factors, but these factors are often difficult to disentangle. In this study, we studied FEF assemblages from plants grown in a botanical garden, enabling us to minimize the variation in abiotic environmental conditions and fungal dispersal capacity. FEF assemblages from 46 Ficus species were sequenced using next-generation methods, and the results indicated that closely related host species had clearly differentiated FEF assemblages. Furthermore, host phylogenetic proximity was significantly correlated with the similarity of their FEF assemblages. In the canonical correspondence analysis, eleven leaf traits explained 32.9% of the total variation in FEF assemblages, whereas six traits (specific leaf area, leaf N content, leaf pH, toughness, latex alkaloid content, and latex volume per leaf area) were significant in the first two dimensions of ordination space.

Endophytic fungi has the potency to suppress plant diseases by acting as induced resistant agent. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of endophytic fungi application on incidence of yellow leaf curl disease of chilli pepper. Four isolates of endophytic fungi, i.e. Cercospora nicotianae isolate H5, Curvularia sp. isolate H12, Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 and AC-4.5 were applied as seed treatment and leaf spray on 2 chilli varieties, 'Biola' and 'Luwes'. Observations of incubation period showed that delayed symptom occurred on application of Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 and Curvularia sp. isolate H12. Disease incidence reached 100 % in all treatments. Less severe symptom was observed on application of Curvularia sp. isolate H12. Most plants infected by PYLCIV showed obvious symptoms of yellow mosaic, leaf curling and stunting. Plant productivity analysis showed that application of Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 resulted higher fruit weight and this treatment may induce tolerant response of the plants to PYLCIV infection.

390,Presence,"Endophytic fungi were isolated from healthy, living, and symptomless tissues of inner bark, leaf, and roots of Aegle marmelos, a well-known medicinal plant, growing in different parts of India including Varanasi. A total of 79 isolates of endophytic fungi were isolated, representing 21 genera, adopting a standard isolation protocol. Members of the deuteromycotina were more prevalent than ascomycotina and others. The result was quite encouraging in terms of maximum isolates recovery from hyphomycetes (78.5%) followed by ascomycetes (8.9%) and coelomycetes (7.6%) respectively, which corroborates previous studies in same area. However, 5.1% isolates remained unidentified and were classified under Mycelia Sterilia. No isolate was obtained from either basidiomycotina or from zygomycotina. Fusarium spp. had maximum colonization frequency (8.00%) in this plant. The other dominant endophytic genera were Aspergillus spp., Alternaria sp., Drechslera sp., Rhizoctonia sp., Curvularia sp., Nigrospora sp., and Stenella sp. Only two ascomycetous members Chaetomium globosum and Emericella sp. (perfect state of Aspergillus sp.) were obtained from the bark sample.

391,Presence,"Introduction In addition to the mycotoxin swainsonine, the locoweed endophytic fungus Alternaria oxytropis (Pleosporaceae) also produces a series of rarely reported, highly oxygenated bicyclic guaiane sesquiterpenoids. Few investigations on the electrospray tandem mass fragmentation pattern of this sesquiterpenoid have been reported. Objectives We aimed to analyze and detect new guaiane sesquiterpenoid analogues from crude extracts of the locoweed endophytic fungus A. oxytropis by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS experiments. Materials and Methods Oxytropiols A-J (1-10) and the extract of the locoweed endophytic fungus A. oxytropis were analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS in positive mode. Results Typical neutral losses, McLafferty rearrangement, 1,2-rearrangement, and 1,3-rearrangement were considered to be the main fragmentation patterns for the [M + H](+)/[M + Na](+) ions of 1-10 by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS experiments, and possible fragmentation pathways of 1-10 were suggested. A unique and undescribed analogue named oxytropiol K (11) was found in the extract based on UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis. Compound 11 was isolated and elucidated by NMR spectrometry, and its UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis was consistent with the fragmentation pathways of 1-10. Conclusion The results further support that UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS is a powerful and sensitive tool for the characterization of known compounds (dereplication) and the detection of new analogues from crude extracts and imply that the locoweed endophytic fungus A. oxytropis, with few chemical investigations, is an important resource for undescribed metabolites.","Tan, XM; Li, Q; Wang, YD; Wang, TL; Yang, J; Sun, BD; Guo, LP; Ding, G",NA,,,"Tan, Xiang-Mei; Li, Qi; Wang, Yan-Duo; Wang, Tie-Lin; Yang, Jian; Sun, Bing-Da; Guo, Lan-Ping; Ding, Gang",NA,UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis of the guaiane sesquiterpenoids oxytropiols A-J and detection of undescribed analogues from the locoweed endophytic fungus Alternaria oxytropis (Pleosporaceae),PHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"tan, xiangmei/GZA-7369-2022",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0958-0344,1099-1565,,NA,NA,APR,2022,33,3,,,NA,344,354,,10.1002/pca.3092,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.3092,,21-Nov,NA,NA,NA,NA,34755399,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000716097400001,View Full Record in Web of Science,391,NA

401,Presence,"Opuntia ficus-indica Mill. (forage cactus) is farmed with relative success in the semi-arid region of the Brazilian northeast for commercial purposes, particularly as forage and food. Endophytic microorganisms are those that can be isolated inside plant tissues and can be a new source to production of enzymes with different potentialities. The objective of this study was to describe the richness of endophytic fungi from O. ficus-indica and to detect the capacity of these species to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. Forty-four endophytic fungi species were isolated. Among them, the most commonly found were Cladosporium cladosporioides (20.43%) and C. sphaerospermum (15.99%). Acremonium terricola, Monodictys castaneae, Penicillium glandicola, Phoma tropica and Tetraploa aristata are being reported for the first time as endophytic fungi for Brazil. The majority of isolated fungi exhibited enzymatic potential. Aspergillus japonicus and P. glandicola presented pectinolytic activity. Xylaria sp. was the most important among the other 14 species with positive cellulase activity. All 24 isolates analysed were xylanase-positive. Protease was best produced by isolate PF103. The results indicate that there is a significant richness of endophytic fungi in O. ficus-indica, and that these isolates indicate promising potential for deployment in biotechnological processes involving production of pectinases, cellulases, xylanases and proteases.","Bezerra, JDP; Santos, MGS; Svedese, VM; Lima, DMM; Fernandes, MJS; Paiva, LM; Souza-Motta, CM",NA,,,"Bezerra, J.

402,Review,"Medicinal plants are an important source of bioactive compounds and have been used to isolate various bioactive compounds having industrial applications. The demand for plants derived bioactive molecules is increasing gradually. However, the extensive use of these plants to extract bioactive molecules has threatened many plant species. Moreover, extracting bioactive molecules from these plants is laborious, costly, and time-consuming. So, some alternative sources and strategies are urgently needed to produce these bioactive molecules similar to that of plant origin. However, the interest in new bioactive molecules has recently shifted from plants to endophytic fungi because many fungi produce bioactive molecules similar to their host plant. Endophytic fungi live in mutualistic association within the healthy plant tissue without causing disease symptoms to the host plant. These fungi are a treasure house of novel bioactive molecules having broad pharmaceutical, industrial, and agricultural applications. The rapid increase in publications in this domain over the last three decades proves that natural product biologists and chemists are paying great attention to the natural bioactive products from endophytic fungi. Though endophytes are source of novel bioactive molecules but there is need of advanced technologies like clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) and epigenetic modifiers to enhance the production of compounds having industrial applications. This review provides an overview of the various industrial applications of bioactive molecules produced by endophytic fungi and the rationale behind selecting specific plants for fungal endophyte isolation.

407,Presence,"Glioblastoma is the most devastating primary brain tumor. Current treatment is palliative, making necessary the development of new therapeutic strategies to offer alternatives to patients. Therefore, endophytes represent an interesting source of natural metabolites with anticancer potential. These microorganisms reside in tissues of living plants and act to improve their growth. Evidence revealed that several medicinal plants are colonized by endophytic fungi producer of antitumor metabolites. Achyrocline satureioides is a Brazilian medicinal plant characterized by its properties against gastrointestinal disturbances, anticancer and antioxidant effects. However, there are no reports describing the endophytic composition of A. satureioides. The present study proposes the isolation of endophytic fungus from A. satureioides, extract preparation, phytochemical characterization and evaluation of its antiglioma potential. Our data showed that crude extracts of endophyte decreased glioma viability with IC50 values of 1.60-1.63 mu g/mL to eDCM (dichloromethane extract) and 37.30-55.12 mu g/mL to eEtAc (ethyl acetate extract), respectively. Crude extracts induced cell death by apoptosis with modulation of redox status. In order to bioprospect anticancer metabolites, endophytic fungus extracts were subjected to guided fractionation and purification yielded five fractions of each extract. Six of ten fractions showed selective antiproliferative activity against glioma cells, with IC50 values ranged from 0.95 to 131.3 mu g/mL. F3(DCM) (from eDCM) and F3(EtA)(c) (from eEtAc) fractions promoted C6 glioma toxicity with IC50 of 1.0 and 27.05 mu g/mL, respectively. F3(EtA)(c) fraction induced late apoptosis and arrest in G2/M stage, while F3(DCM) promoted apoptosis with arrest in Sub-G1 phase. Moreover, F3(DCM) increased antioxidant defense and decreased ROS production. Additionally, F3(DCM) showed no cytotoxic activity against astrocytes, revealing selective effect. Based on promising potential of F3(DCM), we identified the production of Sch-642305, a lactone, which showed antiproliferative properties with IC50 values of 1.1 and 7.6 mu g/mL to C6 and U138MG gliomas, respectively. Sch-642305 promoted arrest on cell cycle in G2/M inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, this lactone decreased glioma cell migration and modulated redox status, increasing superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and enhancing sulfhydryl content, consequently suppressing reactive species of oxygen generation.

411,Review,"Insect association with fungi has a long history. Theories dealing with the evolution of insect herbivory indicate that insects used microbes including fungi as their principal food materials before flowering plants evolved. Subtlety and the level of intricacy in the interactions between insects and fungi indicate symbiosis as the predominant ecological pattern. The nature of the symbiotic interaction that occurs between two organisms (the insect and the fungus), may be either mutualistic or parasitic, or between these two extremes. However, the triangular relationship involving three organisms, viz., an insect, a fungus, and a vascular plant is a relationship that is more complicated than what can be described as either mutualism or parasitism, and may represent facets of both. Recent research has revealed such a complex relationship in the vertically transmitted type-I endophytes living within agriculturally important grasses and the pestiferous insects that attack them. The intricacy of the association depends on the endophytic fungus-grass association and the insect present. Secondary compounds produced in the endophytic fungus-grass association can provide grasses with resistance to herbivores resulting in mutualistic relationship between the fungus and the plant that has negative consequences for herbivorous insects. The horizontally transmitted nongrass type-II endophytes are far less well studied and as such their ecological roles are not fully understood. This forum article explores the intricacy of dependence in such complex triangular relationships drawing from well-established examples from the fungi that live as endophytes in vascular plants and how they impact on the biology and evolution of free-living as well as concealed (e. g., gall-inducing, gall-inhabiting) insects. Recent developments with the inoculation of strains of type-I fungal endophytes into grasses and their commercialization are discussed, along with the possible roles the endophytic fungi play in the galls induced by the Cecidomyiidae (Diptera).","Raman, A; Wheatley, W; Popay, A",NA,,,"Raman, A.; Wheatley, W.; Popay, A.",NA,Endophytic Fungus-Vascular Plant-Insect Interactions,ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,"Raman, Anantanarayanan/0000-0002-7293-7412; Popay, Alison/0000-0002-0201-5308",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0046-225X,1938-2936,,NA,NA,JUN,2012,41,3,,,NA,433,447,,10.1603/EN11317,http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EN11317,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,22732600,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000305475600004,View Full Record in Web of Science,411,NA

The objective of this work was to evaluate the interaction of the dark septate endophytic fungi with cowpea plants under salt stress. Endophytic fungi were isolated from Vochysia divergens root system, and molecular identification of fungi was performed by sequencing the ITS region. We selected and identified Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and Melanconiella elegans-21W2 for their ability to infect V. divergens root in vitro with development of typical dark septate fungi structures. Cowpea plants-inoculated or not inoculated with Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and M. elegans 21W2-were cultivated in 5-L pots under greenhouse conditions and submitted to four different electrical conductivities of irrigation water (1.2, 2.2, 3.6, and 5.0 dS m(-1)). The salinity caused decrease in leaf concentration of K and increased leaf concentration of calcium, sodium, and chlorine; and no influence of dark septate endophytic fungi was observed in these responses. On the other hand, root colonization with Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and M. elegans 21W2 resulted in improved nutrition with N and P in cowpea under salt stress, favoring the growth and rate of liquid photosynthesis.

Since endophytic fungi possess the natural capacity to produce the similar secondary metabolite to that of their host plants, they are promising as alternative sources of plant bioactive natural products. In this study, in order to search for SSd-producing strains, endophytes were isolated from B. scorzonerifolium and were authenticated by the ITS sequence and the translation elongation factor-1alpha gene (TEF-1 alpha) sequence analysis. The profile of metabolites present in the crude exacts was carried out by ultra performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) analysis. The results showed that two strains, CHS2 and CHS3 from B. scorzonerifolium could produce SSd by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS analysis, and the amount of SSd produced by strain CHS2 and CHS3 were about 2.17 and 2.40 mu g/mL, respectively. CHS2 and CHS3 showed a close phylogenetic relationship to Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium acuminatum, respectively.

414,Presence,"Plants cope with abiotic stress in several ways, including by collaborating with microorganisms. Epichloe, an endophytic fungus, has been shown to improve plant tolerance to extreme external environments. Hordeum bogdanii is a known salt-tolerant plant with the potential to improve alkaline lands. NHX1 plays a key role in the transport of ions in the cell and is overexpressed in plants with increased salt tolerance. However, the expression levels of HbNHX1 in Epichloe endophytic fungal symbionts in H. bogdanii have not been elucidated. We used Hordeum bogdanii (E+) with the endophytic fungi Epichloe bromicola and H. bogdanii (E-) without the endophytic fungi and compared the differences in the ion content and HbNHX1 expression between the shoots and roots of E+ and E- plants under alkaline stress. The absorption capacity of both K+ and Na+ of H. bogdanii with endophytic fungi was higher than that without endophytic fungi. In the absence of alkaline stress, endophytic fungi significantly reduced the Cl- content in the host H. bogdanii. Alkaline stress reduced SO42- content in H. bogdanii; however, compared with E-, endophytic fungi increased the content of SO42- in E+ plants. With an increase in the alkaline concentration, the expression of HbNHX1 in the roots of H. bogdanii with endophytic fungus exhibited an upward trend, whereas the expression in the shoots exhibited a downward trend first and then an upward trend. Under 100 mmol center dot L-1 mixed alkaline stress, the expression of HbNHX1 in E+ was significantly higher than that in E-, indicating that endophytic fungi could increase the Na+ region in vacuoles. The external environment affects the regulation of endophytic fungi in H. bogdanii and that endophytic fungi can play a key role in soil salinization. Therefore, the findings of this study will provide technical support and a theoretical basis for better utilization of endophytic fungi from H. bogdanii in saline land improvement.","Long, F; Hu, MF; Chen, S; Bao, GS; Dan, H; Chen, SH",NA,,,"Long, Feng; Hu, Meng-Fei; Chen, Sheng; Bao, Gen-Sheng; Dan, Han; Chen, Shui-Hong",NA,Endophytic Fungi Regulate HbNHX1 Expression and Ion Balance in Hordeum bogdanii under Alkaline Stress,JOURNAL OF FUNGI,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hu, Mengfei/ABG-3590-2020; Long, Feng/AAN-4694-2021","Hu, Mengfei/0000-0003-4272-144X;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2309-608X,,NA,NA,MAR,2023,9,3,,,NA,,,331,10.3390/jof9030331,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof9030331,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,36983499,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000958230700001,View Full Record in Web of Science,414,NA
415,Presence,"Background: Paclitaxel (Taxol (TM)) is an important anticancer drug with a unique mode of action. The biosynthesis of paclitaxel had been considered restricted to the Taxus species until it was discovered in Taxomyces andreanae, an endophytic fungus of T. brevifolia. Subsequently, paclitaxel was found in hazel (Corylus avellana L.) and in several other endophytic fungi. The distribution of paclitaxel in plants and endophytic fungi and the reported sequence homology of key genes in paclitaxel biosynthesis between plant and fungi species raises the question about whether the origin of this pathway in these two physically associated groups could have been facilitated by horizontal gene transfer. Results: The ability of the endophytic fungus of hazel Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 to independently synthesize paclitaxel was established by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance. The genome of Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 was sequenced and gene candidates that may be involved in paclitaxel biosynthesis were identified by comparison with the 13 known paclitaxel biosynthetic genes in Taxus. We found that paclitaxel biosynthetic gene candidates in P. aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 have evolved independently and that horizontal gene transfer between this endophytic fungus and its plant host is unlikely. Conclusions: Our findings shed new light on how paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungi synthesize paclitaxel, and will facilitate metabolic engineering for the industrial production of paclitaxel from fungi.","Yang, YF; Zhao, HN; Barrero, RA; Zhang, BH; Sun, GL; Wilson, IW; Xie, FL; Walker, KD; Parks, JW; Bruce, R; Guo, GW; Chen, L; Zhang, Y; Huang, X; Tang, Q; Liu, HW; Bellgard, MI; Qiu, DY; Lai, JS; Hoffman, A",NA,,,"Yang, Yanfang; Zhao, Hainan; Barrero, Roberto A.; Zhang, Baohong; Sun, Guiling; Wilson, Iain W.; Xie, Fuliang; Walker, Kevin D.; Parks, Joshua W.; Bruce, Robert; Guo, Guangwu; Chen, Li; Zhang, Yong; Huang, Xin; Tang, Qi; Liu, Hongwei; Bellgard, Matthew I.; Qiu, Deyou; Lai, Jinsheng; Hoffman, Angela",NA,Genome sequencing and analysis of the paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungus Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431,BMC GENOMICS,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wilson, Iain/D-4839-2009; Zhang, Yong/AAS-3454-2020; Zhang, Baohong/O-4948-2016","Wilson, Iain/0000-0002-4626-8059; Bellgard, Matthew/0000-0002-6303-9469; Zhang, Yong/0000-0002-2276-7187; Walker, Kevin/0000-0001-5208-6692; Barrero, Roberto/0000-0002-7735-665X; Tang, Qi/0000-0003-2385-4263",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1471-2164,,,NA,NA,25-Jan,2014,15,,,,NA,,,69,10.1186/1471-2164-15-69,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-15-69,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,24460898,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000332573300001,View Full Record in Web of Science,415,NA

Endophytic fungi were isolated from soybean leaves and initially screened on agar plates for the production of CMCase (carboxymethylcellulase), xylanase, amylase and protease. The highest Enzymatic Indexes (IE) were verified for xylanase (2.14 and 1.31) with the fungi M6-A6P5F2 and M12-A5P3F1.2 and CMCase (1.92 and 1.62) with the fungi M13-A9P2F1 and M12-A5P3F1.2, respectively. The production of xylanase and CMCase by the selected fungi was evaluated in submerged cultivation using beechwood xylan and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), as well as sugarcane straw and bagasse in different ratios as carbon sources. Both types of lignocellulosic biomass proved to be good inducers of enzymatic activity. The best xylanase producer among the isolates was identified as Colletotrichum boninense. With this fungus, the highest xylanase activity was obtained with a sugarcane straw-bagasse mixture in a 50:50 ratio (383.63 U mL(-1)), a result superior to that obtained with the use of beechwood xylan (296.65 U mL(-1)). Regardingthe kinetic behavior of the crude xylanase, there was found optimal pH of 5.0 and optimal temperatures of 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C.

First, high-throughput sequencing technology was applied to explore the community composition and diversity of endophytic fungi in the above-ground tissues (Ea) and below-ground tissues (Eb) of Ephedra sinica. Second, fungi were obtained through culture-dependent technology and used for mini-community remodeling in vitro. Then, the effects of environmental factors, partner fungi, and plant tissue fluid (internal environment) on endophytic fungal community formation were discussed.

480,Presence,"Fungal endophytes of the genus Acremonium infect many grass species. They exist in the intercellular spaces of the aerial plant parts, most abundantly in the leaf sheaths. They therefore must obtain all of their nutrients from the apoplastic spaces in the plant. This report is the first comprehensive, biochemically based study of sugar uptake by Acremonium spp. The endophytes (Acremonium typhinum) were isolated from Festuca rubra plants and were grown in culture. Individual colonies were incubated in the presence of [U-C-14] radiolabeled glucose, fructose, or sucrose for 20 minutes and the uptake quantified by scintillation counting. The uptake rates for all three sugars were biphasic, indicating two distinct mechanisms of transport. At low sugar concentrations (below 10 mM) the uptake was saturable and had the characteristics of a carrier-mediated mechanism. At high sugar concentrations (10-100 mM) the uptake was linear suggesting diffusion as the predominant mechanism of uptake. From competition experiments (uptake of labeled sugar in the presence of a different unlabeled sugar) it appeared that there were separate carriers for glucose and fructose. Two mechanisms for sucrose uptake were detected, a sucrose carrier and hexose uptake as a result of cell wall invertase. Cell wall invertase activity of the fungal isolates was inducible by growing the fungi on sucrose containing media.","LAM, CK; BELANGER, FC; WHITE, JF; DAIE, J",NA,NA,NA,"LAM, CK; BELANGER, FC; WHITE, JF; DAIE, J",NA,"MECHANISM AND RATE OF SUGAR UPTAKE BY ACREMONIUM-TYPHINUM, AN ENDOPHYTIC FUNGUS INFECTING FESTUCA-RUBRA - EVIDENCE FOR PRESENCE OF A CELL-WALL INVERTASE IN ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI",MYCOLOGIA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"White, James/C-2280-2009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0027-5514,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAY-JUN,1994,86,3,NA,NA,NA,408,415,NA,10.2307/3760573,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3760573,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1994NZ04600013,NA,480,NA
481,Presence,"Many plant endophytes produce mycotoxins, but how host genetic variation influences endophyte colonization and mycotoxin production under natural conditions is poorly understood. This interaction has not been fully considered in many previous studies which used controlled experiments with agronomic or model plant species. Here, we investigated this interaction in a naturally occurring forb (a locoweed species) Oxytropis ochrocephala, its symbiotic endophyte Alternaria oxytropis, and the mycotoxin swainsonine. Host genetic variation was characterized by microsatellite markers. Endophyte infection rate and swainsonine levels were determined by PCR and HPLC, respectively. Genetic markers defined two distinct host populations and revealed that host genetics were significantly correlated with geographical location, elevation, and precipitation. As the host diverged, symbiotic interactions were reduced or failed to produce detectable swainsonine in one host population. Host genotype and precipitation had a significant impact in shaping swainsonine production at the population level. This study highlights the effect of host genotype in influencing this interaction in locoweeds.","He, W; Guo, LW; Wang, L; Zhao, QQ; Guo, LZ; Cao, W; Mur, LAJ; Wei, YH",NA,NA,NA,"He, Wei; Guo, Linwei; Wang, Lei; Zhao, Qianqian; Guo, Lizhu; Cao, Wei; Mur, Luis A.

482,Presence,"Microbial plant symbionts are widely spread in nature changing the way their hosts interact with their environment. Neotyphodium fungal endophytes (Clavicipitaceae) are grass symbionts known by their production of alkaloids, toxic for herbivores. Here, we hypothesized that endophytes confer associational protection to non-host plants and change emission of host volatile-compounds. In an outdoor mesocosm experiment, we examined aphid infestation on Trifolium repens plants, in response to Neotyphodium occultans presence in neighbouring Lolium multiflorum. Contrasting levels of Rhizobium were generated in T. repens plants considering that symbiosis with N-2-fixers would influence herbivore abundance. Aphid infestation increased responding to symbiotic status of T. repens plants, when surrounded by non-symbiotic L. multiflorum plants. Endophytes modified the volatile imprints of L. multiflorum plants measured by an electronic nose, suggesting a potential mechanism to benefit neighbours. This associational protection constitutes a new mutualism trait of grass-endophyte symbiosis, becoming a non-private benefit available to other community partners.

483,Presence,"Morphological and physiological responses to water deficit of two tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) cultivars were compared in a glasshouse experiment and the effect, on those responses, of artificial infection of the tall fescue plants with two fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum) strains was evaluated. The cultivars were Maris Kasba (MK), of Mediterranean origin, and El Palenque (EP), an Argentinian cultivar of temperate origin. The endophyte strains AgResearch isolate (AR501) and the Kentucky (KY31) wild type were compared with nil-endophyte controls. Leaf growth rare of EP plants under water deficit was higher and leaf senescence rate lower than for MK plants (P < 0.05). MK plants showed a greater increase in the proportion of dead leaf tissue than EP plants as water deficit increased (P < 0.05). Stomatal conductance and lamina osmotic adjustment at low soil moisture were lower for MK than EP (P < 0.05). Endophyte-infected plants had a lower dry weight and tiller number, but a higher net growth rate during water deficit treatments than endophyte-free plants (P < 0.05). A significant cultivar x endophyte interaction (P < 0.05) was observed for many variables studied. This implies that any new endophyte strain should be evaluated in combination with the plant genotypes with which it is likely to be associated in commercial practice. MK-KY31 and EP-AR501 associations appeared to tolerate short-term water deficit more effectively than other associations studied.

484,Presence,"Most plants obtain nitrogen through nitrogen-fixing bacteria and microbial decomposition of plant and animal material. Many vascular plants are able to form close symbiotic associations with endophytic fungi. Metarhizium is a common plant endophyte found in a large number of ecosystems. This abundant soil fungus is also a pathogen to a large number of insects, which are a source of nitrogen. It is possible that the endophytic capability and insect pathogenicity of Metarhizium are coupled to provide an active method of nitrogen transfer to plant hosts via fungal mycelia. We used soil microcosms to test the ability of M. robertsii to translocate insect-derived nitrogen to plants. Insects were injected with N-15-labeled nitrogen, and we tracked the incorporation of N-15 into amino acids in two plant species, haricot bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), in the presence of M. robertsii. These findings are evidence that active nitrogen acquisition by plants in this tripartite interaction may play a larger role in soil nitrogen cycling than previously thought.","Behie, SW; Zelisko, PM; Bidochka, MJ",NA,NA,NA,"Behie, S.

485,Presence,"Phyllosticta is a cosmopolitan group of fungi found on various host plants, occurring as pathogens, endophytes and saprobes. Diseases caused by Phyllosticta commonly include leaf and fruit spots that can affect economically important plants. The genus is characterized mainly by aseptate and hyaline conidia and ascospores. Its conidia are surrounded by a mucilaginous sheath, with a single mucoid apical appendage while ascospores exhibit a mucoid cap at both ends. Given that many Phyllosticta taxa are cryptic and share similar morphologies, it is arduous to depict taxonomically relevant characters solely on the basis of morphological or ecological features. Coupled with morphological description, multi -locus phylogenetic analyses of species comprising complexes are used to broadly describe this genus and understand species boundaries. Despite several published taxonomic revisions and enumerations of Phyllosticta species, there is still considerable confusion when identifying these taxa. Herein, we establish three new host records for P. capitalensis, and one new geographical record for P. musaechinensis in Thailand, and one new host and geographical record for P. citribrasiliensis in Russia. We provide an updated phylogenetic tree based on several gene markers: ITS, LSU, ACT, GAPDH, RPB2, and TEF-1 alpha. This includes all Phyllosticta species for which sequence data is available.

Microbial symbionts are proposed to have profound effects on fitness of their host plants and vice versa, especially when their fitness is tightly linked. Here we studied local adaptation of host plants and possible fitness contribution of such symbiosis in the context of abiotic environmental factors. We conducted a four-way multi-year reciprocal transplant experiment with natural populations of the perennial grass Festuca rubra s.l. from northern and southern Finland, Faroe Islands and Spain. We included F. rubra with and without transmitted symbiotic fungus Epichloe that is vertically transmitted via host seed. We found local adaptation across the European range, as evidenced by higher host fitness of the local geographic origin compared with nonlocals at three of the four studied sites, suggesting that selection pressures are driving evolution in different directions. Abiotic factors did not result in strong fitness effects related to Epichloe symbiosis, indicating that other factors such as herbivory are more likely to contribute to fitness differences between plants naturally occurring with or without Epichloe. Nevertheless, in the case of asymmetric symbiosis that is obligatory for the symbiont, abiotic conditions that affect performance of the host, may also cause selective pressure for the symbiont.","Leinonen, PH; Helander, M; Vazquez-de-Aldana, BR; Zabalgogeazcoa, I; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Leinonen, Paivi; Helander, Marjo; Vazquez-de-Aldana, Beatriz; Zabalgogeazcoa, Inigo; Saikkonen, Kari",NA,Local adaptation in natural European host grass populations with asymmetric symbiosis,PLOS ONE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zabalgogeazcoa, Inigo/F-9523-2016; Leinonen, Paivi/IWV-0880-2023; Vazquez-de-Aldana, Beatriz/A-7760-2008","Zabalgogeazcoa, Inigo/0000-0002-9524-7799; Leinonen, Paivi/0000-0003-0210-5589; Vazquez-de-Aldana, Beatriz/0000-0001-6549-3545; Saikkonen, Kari/0000-0001-5203-9984",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1932-6203,NA,NA,NA,NA,17-Apr,2019,14,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0215510,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215510,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30995278,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000465010000058,NA,486,NA

We posited that the abiotic factors shaping tree diversity extend to hyperdiverse symbionts in leaves-fungal endophytes-that influence plant health, function, and resilience to stress. Through surveys in forests across Panama that considered climate, seasonality, and covarying biotic factors, we demonstrate that endophyte richness varies negatively with temperature seasonality. Endophyte community structure and taxonomic composition reflect both temperature seasonality and climate (mean annual temperature and precipitation). Overall our findings highlight the vital role of climate-related factors in shaping the hyperdiversity of these important and little-known symbionts of the trees that, in turn, form the foundations of tropical forest biodiversity.","Oita, S; Ibáñez, A; Lutzoni, F; Miadlikowska, J; Geml, J; Lewis, LA; Hom, EFY; Carbone, I; U'Ren, JM; Arnold, AE",NA,NA,NA,"Oita, Shuzo; Ibanez, Alicia; Lutzoni, Francois; Miadlikowska, Jolanta; Geml, Jozsef; Lewis, Louise A.; Hom, Erik F.

491,Both,"Cool-season grasses establish symbioses with vertically transmitted Neotyphodium endophytes widespread in nature. The frequency of endophyte-infected plants in closed populations (i.e., without migrations) depends on both the differential fitness between infected and non-infected plants, and the endophyte-transmission efficiency. Most studies have been focused on the first mechanism ignoring the second. Infection frequency and endophyte transmission from vegetative tissues to seeds were surveyed in two grasses growing in vegetation units that differ in flood and grazing regimes, and soil salinity. Transmission efficiency and infection frequency for tall fescue did not vary significantly and were 0.98 and 1.00, respectively. For Italian ryegrass, transmission efficiency and infection frequency were 0.88 and 0.57 in humid prairies, and 0.96 and 0.96 in the other vegetation units. Only in humid mesophytic meadows, the observed pattern was irrespective of the presence or absence of grazers. Our results suggest that selection forces for endophyte infection are different for both species. Imperfect transmission was only compensated in tall fescue through an increased fitness of infected plants. Interpreting variations of infection frequency only in terms of differential fitness can be misleading, considering that endophyte transmission can be imperfect and variable in nature. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of measuring transmission efficiency.","Gundel, PE; Garibaldi, LA; Tognetti, PM; Aragón, R; Ghersa, CM; Omacini, M",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro E.; Garibaldi, Lucas A.; Tognetti, Pedro M.; Aragon, Roxana; Ghersa, Claudio M.; Omacini, Marina",NA,Imperfect Vertical Transmission of the Endophyte <i>Neotyphodium</i> in Exotic Grasses in Grasslands of the Flooding Pampa,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tognetti, Pedro/AAF-7018-2019; Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Garibaldi, Lucas/D-7302-2013","Garibaldi, Lucas Alejandro/0000-0003-0725-4049; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Tognetti, Pedro M./0000-0001-7358-1334; Omacini, Marina/0000-0003-1460-262X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0095-3628,1432-184X,NA,NA,NA,MAY,2009,57,4,NA,NA,NA,740,748,NA,10.1007/s00248-008-9447-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-008-9447-y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18797956,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000265044900015,NA,491,NA

493,Both,"Pooideae grasses may be colonized by systemic fungal endophytes. The fitness of endophyte depends entirely on resources and seed transmission from the host plant, while colonized plants may gain increased survival, growth, and reproduction relative to their uncolonized conspecifics. Most research of endophyte-grass interactions have been carried out on few cultivars of tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix) and their symbiont Neotyphodium coenophialum. Lack of studies using wild populations of tall fescue across the species natural distribution range, however, limits the understanding of the ecological and evolutionary role of the symbiosis in nature. We performed a common garden experiment in Southern Finland with three wild, tall fescue populations from northern Europe and the forage cultivar Kentucky-31 (KY-31). For each population, we used naturally endophyte-colonized, naturally endophyte-colonized but endophyte removed (decolonized), and naturally uncolonized plants to separate effects due to the host genotype from the endophyte. We evaluated growth variables and survival in four environmental treatments of varying water and nutrients. Supply of water and nutrients increased plant biomass and reproductive effort in all populations. This effect was higher for KY-31 plants which produced on average 55 % more seeds than wild plants, indicating better adaptation to high resource environments. However, the higher incidence of Claviceps sp. and the low winter survival indicated KY-31 tall fescue is mal-adapted to Northern European conditions. Naturally colonized plants had greater plant biomass (a parts per thousand 12 %), reproductive effort (a parts per thousand 22 %) and seed mass (a parts per thousand 29 %) than naturally uncolonized and decolonized plants. Nonetheless, endophyte colonization did not affect plant survival, and the effects of endophyte colonization on tiller number, panicle/tiller ratio and Claviceps sp. incidence depended on the population origin. In the wild populations, endophyte removal only reduced the number of tillers (a parts per thousand 29 % lower), while the difference between naturally colonized and naturally uncolonized plants was not significant. Our results show that endophyte symbiont increases tall fescue performance in general, but the differences between wild populations and cultivars indicate adaptation to local habitats and agronomic management, respectively. The comparison of naturally endophyte-colonized and decolonized plants suggests certain plant genotype-endophyte combinations found within populations result from local selection pressures.","Gundel, PE; Helander, M; Casas, C; Hamilton, CE; Faeth, SH; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro E.; Helander, Marjo; Casas, Cecilia; Hamilton, Cyd E.; Faeth, Stanley H.; Saikkonen, Kari",NA,<i>Neotyphodium</i> fungal endophyte in tall fescue (<i>Schedonorus phoenix</i>): a comparison of three Northern European wild populations and the cultivar Kentuky-31,FUNGAL DIVERSITY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013","Casas, Cecilia/0000-0003-3538-6081; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Hamilton, Cyd/0000-0002-6378-3407; Saikkonen, Kari/0000-0001-5203-9984; Helander, Marjo/0000-0002-9759-4321",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1560-2745,1878-9129,NA,NA,NA,MAY,2013,60,1,NA,SI,NA,15,24,NA,10.1007/s13225-012-0173-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13225-012-0173-x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000320112900003,NA,493,NA

The major life-history traits and aspects of the epidemiology (isolation, survival, reproduction, dispersal, host selectivity) and control of the oak anthracnose agent are elucidated. The role of weather patterns in disrupting the delicate interaction between the host tree and the microorganism is outlined. The evidence suggests that changes in the climate profoundly alter the plant-endophyte symbiosis, generating conflicts of interest between the partners in the interaction. When such competing interests arise, the survival and reproduction of one member of the interaction do not conform with that of the partner. The interaction becomes thus disadvantageous and harmful to one of the organisms and the symbiosis from mutualistic or neutral turns antagonistic. The fungal partner, which under normal conditions survives in quiescence, with a low biomass, resumes growth but now switches from a latent, asymptomatic occupier of inner oak tissues to an aggressive coloniser that sporulates profusely over the tree surface. The importance of investigating the functioning and the role of the plant-endophyte symbiosis in perennial host trees in natural forests is stressed.","Moricca, S; Ragazzi, A",NA,"Pirttila, AM; Frank, AC",NA,"Moricca, Salvatore; Ragazzi, Alessandro",NA,The Holomorph <i>Apiognomonia quercina</i>/<i>Discula quercina</i> as a Pathogen/Endophyte in Oak,ENDOPHYTES OF FOREST TREE: BIOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS,Forestry Sciences,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0924-5480,1875-1334,978-94-007-1598-1,NA,NA,NA,2011,80,NA,NA,NA,NA,47,66,NA,10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8_3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8_3,10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000294391600003,NA,494,NA

The basic development and structure of ericoid mycorrhizal infections in epacrids is similar to other Ericaceae. However, data are limited on the structure and physiology of both hair roots and ericoid mycorrhizas for all Ericaceae. Relatively little is known about the functional significance of ericoid mycorrhizas in epacrids in southern hemisphere habitats that are often poor in organic matter accumulation. However the abilities of fungal endophytes of epacrids to utilize organic N and P substrates equal those of endophytes from northern hemisphere heathland plant hosts.

501,Presence,"In ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, iron-responsive GATA-type transcriptional repressors are involved in regulating iron homeostasis, notably to prevent iron toxicity through control of iron uptake. To date, it has been unknown whether this iron regulator contributes toward mutualistic endosymbiosis of microbes with plants, a system where the endophyte must function within the constraints of an in-host existence, including a dependency on the host for nutrient acquisition. Functional characterization of one such protein, SreA from Epichloe festucae, a fungal endosymbiont of cool-season grasses, indicates that regulation of iron homeostasis processes is important for symbiotic maintenance. The deletion of the sreA gene (Delta sreA) led to iron-dependent aberrant hyphal growth and the gradual loss of endophyte hyphae from perennial ryegrass. SreA negatively regulates the siderophore biosynthesis and high-affinity iron uptake systems of E. festucae, similar to other fungi, resulting in iron accumulation in mutants. Our evidence suggests that SreA is involved in the processes that moderate Epichloe iron acquisition from the plant apoplast, because overharvesting of iron in Delta sreA mutants was detected as premature chlorosis of the host using a hydroponic plant growth assay. E. festucae appears to have a tightly regulated iron management system, involving SreA that balances endophyte growth with its survival and prevents overcompetition with the host for iron in the intercellular niche, thus promoting mutualistic associations. Mutations that interfere with Epichloe iron management negatively affect iron-dependent fungal growth and destabilize mutualistic Epichloe -ryegrass associations.","Forester, NT; Lane, GA; McKenzie, CM; Lamont, IL; Johnson, LJ",NA,NA,NA,"Forester, Natasha T.; Lane, Geoffrey A.; McKenzie, Catherine M.; Lamont, Iain L.; Johnson, Linda J.",NA,The Role of SreA-Mediated Iron Regulation in Maintaining Epichloe <i>festucae-Lolium</i> <i>perenne</i> Symbioses,MOLECULAR PLANT-MICROBE INTERACTIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"McKenzie, Catherine/O-6723-2018","McKenzie, Catherine/0000-0002-3075-954X; Forester, Natasha Talei/0000-0002-9329-1710",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0894-0282,1943-7706,NA,NA,NA,OCT,2019,32,10,NA,NA,NA,1324,1335,NA,10.1094/MPMI-03-19-0060-R,http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-03-19-0060-R,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31107632,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000488776300009,NA,501,NA
502,Presence,"Observations at three grassland sites in England and Wales on nine perennial ryegrass genotypes infected or not by the endophytic fungus Acremonium lolii, showed that populations of plant-parasitic nematodes were not reduced on endophyte-infected plants during the two years of the experiment. There was evidence at two sites, where numbers of plant nematodes increased during the trial period, that there were significantly more nematodes on endophyte-infected plants. At the third site, where nematode populations did not increase, there was no difference between endophyte treatments. Nematode population changes on one genotype, known to grow better when endophyte-infected, were similar to the average for all genotypes. In a glasshouse pot experiment, invasion and development of root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne naasi, was the same on endophyte-infected and endophyte-free plants of the responsive genotype. In samples from field plots and in the pot experiment, roots of endophyte-infected plants were larger and probably accounted for the increased nematode populations.","COOK, R; LEWIS, GC; MIZEN, KA",NA,NA,NA,"COOK, R; LEWIS, GC; MIZEN, KA",NA,"EFFECTS ON PLANT-PARASITIC NEMATODES OF INFECTION OF PERENNIAL RYEGRASS, LOLIUM-PERENNE, BY THE ENDOPHYTIC FUNGUS, ACREMONIUM-LOLII",CROP PROTECTION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0261-2194,NA,NA,NA,NA,OCT,1991,10,5,NA,NA,NA,403,407,NA,10.1016/S0261-2194(06)80032-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0261-2194(06)80032-3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1991GH97700013,NA,502,NA
503,Presence,"Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is a C-3 perennial grass noted for its persistence in harsh environments. Tall fescue persistence is enhanced by Acremonium coenophialum, a mutualistic fungal endophyte that increases resistance to drought, pathogens, and insects. This research was conducted to identify and elicit biochemical mechanism(s) that could account for tall fescue persistence. In initial studies, two cultivars known to differ in persistence were analyzed for chitinase, an antifungal hydrolase associated with disease resistance in other plants. Acremonium-infected Kentucky 31 (KY31), a persistent cultivar, and Johnstone, a nonpersistent cultivar, were inoculated with the parasitic nematode, Meloidogyne marylandi, grown for 50 days, and analyzed at 10-day intervals. Chitinase fluctuated throughout the 50-day period of seedling development, and activity was highest in the persistent Acremonium-infected KY31. In addition, chitinase was elicited by parasitic M. marylandi and expressed systemically. Subsequent studies were conducted to determine whether or not mutualistic Acremonium could increase chitinase activity. Genetically identical KY31, with and without Acremonium, were grown for 25 days and analyzed for chitinase at 5-day intervals. After 20 days, Acremonium-infected KY31 expressed more chitinase than Acremonium-free KY31. We concluded that chitinase is related to tall fescue persistence; it was highest in the most persistent cultivar, increased under pathogen attack, and increased in the presence of Acremonium, a symbiont known to enhance disease resistance.","ROBERTS, CA; MAREK, SM; NIBLACK, TL; KARR, AL",NA,NA,NA,"ROBERTS, CA; MAREK, SM; NIBLACK, TL; KARR, AL",NA,PARASITIC MELOIDOGYNE AND MUTUALISTIC ACREMONIUM INCREASE CHITINASE IN TALL FESCUE,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Marek, Stephen/Q-6911-2019; Marek, Stephen/M-9865-2013","Marek, Stephen/0000-0002-0146-8049",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0098-0331,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUL,1992,18,7,NA,NA,NA,1107,1116,NA,10.1007/BF00980066,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00980066,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24254151,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1992JD59000013,NA,503,NA
504,Presence,"Tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) infected by Epichloe coenophiala contains ergot alkaloids responsible for fescue toxicosis in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, with only a few cases occurring in Europe. The detection of Epichloe in 166 L. arundinaceum collected in southern France revealed that 60% were infected, 51% being high ergovaline producers. The ergovaline level in endophyte-infected tall fescue Kentucky 31 was monitored during 3 years in various parts of the plant. Maturation of plants, recorded according to the BBCH scale, appeared to be the main factor for estimating the risk of toxicity. Ergovaline levels of =300 mu g/kg dry matter were obtained at the end of spring, the beginning of autumn, and mid-winter. Positive correlation between ergovaline level and cumulative degree-d was observed, whereas rainfall had no effect. These results suggest that the lack of fescue toxicosis observed in France cannot be explained by the lack of ergovaline in tall fescue.","Repussard, C; Zbib, N; Tardieu, D; Guerre, P",NA,NA,NA,"Repussard, Celine; Zbib, Nasrallah; Tardieu, Didier; Guerre, Philippe",NA,Endophyte Infection of Tall Fescue and the Impact of Climatic Factors on Ergovaline Concentrations in Field Crops Cultivated in Southern France,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"GUERRE, Philippe/ABA-8286-2020","GUERRE, Philippe/0000-0002-9777-3784",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0021-8561,1520-5118,NA,NA,NA,1-Oct,2014,62,39,NA,NA,NA,9609,9614,NA,10.1021/jf503015m,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf503015m,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25192465,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000342609500028,NA,504,NA
505,Presence,"The identification of fungal endophytes often relies on culturing isolates from surface-sterilized plant tissue. However, molecular techniques have enabled the rapid detection and identifi cation of targeted endophyte species, and next-generation sequencing technology provides an opportunity to obtain comprehensive information on endophytic communities, directly from plant tissue. In order to achieve accurate detection from internal tissues, surface microbes and associated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) must be eliminated, with particular consideration for the type of plant tissue and the efficacy of the surface sterilization procedure used. The methodology described later was developed specifically for detection of DNA from the entomopathogenic fungal endophyte Beauveria bassiana (Vuillemin) (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) in various tissues of Zea mays (L.). However, the protocol may be easily applied to other fungi and bacterial endophytes. Included is a stringent sodium hypochlorite-based surface sterilization protocol for plant material in preparation for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect target DNA within plant tissue. Included are a treatment for dealing with surface DNA contamination and a novel procedure for assessing the efficacy of surface sterilization using PCR.","McKinnon, AC",NA,"Glare, TR; MoranDiez, ME",NA,"McKinnon, Aimee C.",NA,Plant Tissue Preparation for the Detection of an Endophytic Fungus <i>In Planta</i>,MICROBIAL-BASED BIOPESTICIDES: METHODS AND PROTOCOLS,Methods in Molecular Biology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1064-3745,NA,978-1-4939-6367-6; 978-1-4939-6365-2,NA,NA,NA,2016,1477,NA,NA,NA,NA,167,173,NA,10.1007/978-1-4939-6367-6_13,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-6367-6_13,10.1007/978-1-4939-6367-6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27565499,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000399773100014,NA,505,NA
506,Presence,"The molecular analysis of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis started at the beginning of this decade. The paper summarises the work of the ‘Laboratorium für Molekulare Genetik arbuskulärer Mykorrhiza’ at the MPI für terrestrische Mikrobiologie in Marburg on three major topics. Firstly, the plant response to the mycorrhizal colonisation was analysed using both, targeted and non-targeted approaches. As an example, the localisation of the gst1 mRNA in potato mycorrhiza is shown. Second, molecular techniques were established to analyse gene expression of the fungal partner of the symbiosis. We present a differential RNA display analysis of spore germination in two AM fungi and the cloning of a gene from Glomus mosseae that shows expression at all stages of the fungal life cycle. In the last part, we introduce the work we are carrying out with a new root endophytic fungus, Piriformospora indica. Infection experiments on maize showed that despite the fungus performs as a root necrotroph, it has a positive effect on plant growth. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Franken P.; Requena N.; Bütehorn B.; Krajinski F.; Kuhn G.; Lapopin L.; Mann P.; Rhody D.; Stommel M.,NA,,NA,"Franken, Philipp (7102792218); Requena, Natalia (6603854531); Bütehorn, Britta (7801343267); Krajinski, Franziska (6603375678); Kuhn, Gerrit (58320871300); Lapopin, Laurence (6507415680); Mann, Petra (57191162109); Rhody, Daniela (6507232197); Stommel, Michaela (7003796074)",NA,Molecular analysis of the Arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis,Archives of Agronomy and Soil Science,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,,,,NA,Arbuscular mycorrhiza; Differential gene expression; Piriformospora indica,,"Franken P., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Requena N., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Bütehorn B., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Krajinski F., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Kuhn G., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Lapopin L., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Mann P., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Rhody D., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Stommel M., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany","Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany","P.

507,Both,"Fitness in tall fescue could be determined as the relative seed production by overcoming self-incompatibility barriers. This study was an attempt to investigate the effects of plant genotype and symbiotic fungal endophyte on seed production and associated traits in tall fescue. Fifteen clones of tall fescue free from endophyte and two clones with both endophyte-infected (E+) and non-infected (E-) counterparts were evaluated under two pollination systems of natural open-pollination and obligate self-pollination. Although seed yield was depressed by self-pollination in all E- genotypes, some genotypes exhibited reasonable selfing ratio. However, endophyte infection was much more effective to increase selfing ratio and seed yield through self-pollination particularly in the genotype 75B. Endophyte infection almost removed self-incompatibilty in the host plants and on average resulted in 3.0 times more number of seeds per self-pollinated seedheads than the non-counterpart E- tall fescue genotypes. Although it may need more elaborated studies, incorporating Epichloe fungal endophyte in plant genotypes not only may make the inbreeding in tall fescue possible but also may improve forage yield and seed production, simultaneously.","Zarean, M; Sabzalian, MR; Mirlohi, A; Davoudi, M; Ataii, E",NA,NA,NA,"Zarean, M.; Sabzalian, Mohammad R.; Mirlohi, A.; Davoudi, M.; Ataii, E.",NA,<i>Epichloe</i> endophyte and plant genotype determine seed production through self-pollination in tall fescue,EUPHYTICA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sabzalian, Mohammad R./E-6279-2013","Sabzalian, Mohammad R./0000-0002-7315-9990",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0014-2336,1573-5060,NA,NA,NA,NOV,2017,213,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1007/s10681-017-2037-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-017-2037-7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000413697900012,NA,507,NA

509,Presence,"In a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial experiment, plants of one genotype of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) were grown in soil in pots in a glasshouse on two occasions. The treatments were either with (E+) or without (E-) infection by the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum; with (N+) or without (N-) inoculation by the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne marylandi; and with or without water deficit stress. In the first experiment, nematode numbers after 5 weeks had increased 10 times in the E-/N- watered pots and 22 times in the E-/N+ stressed plants. Root dry weight was decreased in all E-/N+ pots, compared with E-/N-. In contrast, nematode numbers in all E+/N+ pots decreased to nearly zero and root dry weight was unaffected. Osmotic adjustment in the growing zone of stressed plants was -0.35 MPa in E-/N- pots, but only -0.10 MPa in E-/N+ pots. Osmotic adjustment was greatest (-0.64 MPa) in E+ pots of both nematode treatments and almost no nematodes survived in the N+ pots. In the second experiment, there was complete nematode mortality in the E+ pots. Plant water relations were unaffected by treatments, however. It is concluded that endophyte-enhanced persistence of tall rescue in M. marylandi-infested soils that are prone to drought may be explained at least partly by endophyte protection of roots from nematode damage.

513,Both,"An experiment was designed to determine the effect of the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium lolii on the growth, physiological parameters and mineral element content of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perennel L.), when growing at two N supply levels. Endophyte infection had a significant positive effect on both shoot and root growth of ryegrass, but this difference was only significant in the high N supply treatment. At high N supply, endophyte-infected (EI) plants accumulated more soluble sugar in the sheath and the root than endophyte-free (EF) plants. Endophyte infection affected mineral element concentrations in the root more than in the shoot. We found a significant effect of endophyte infection on B, Mn and Mg in the root, but significant effect was only found on B in the shoot.

516,Presence,"Larch sawfly, Pristiphora erichsonii Hartig, and larch needlecast fungus, Mycosphaerella laricinia (R. Hartig) Neg., are early season defoliators restricted only to Larix host trees. Larch defoliation (100%) by either the fungus or insect, but not mechanical removal, induced systemic responses that reduced sawfly consumption and digestion rates one year later. In a feeding behavior assay, larvae quickly abandoned seedlings previously defoliated by M. laricinia. Adult female oviposition choice and egg deposition were unaffected. Seedling growth was not affected during the year of defoliation by M. laricinia, but was significantly reduced one year later. Defoliation by M. laricinia reduced stem volume, radial growth, root biomass and new shoot production. The latter tissue is the only oviposition resource for larch sawfly, and, in contrast, is not influenced by sawfly feeding. We hypothesize that M. laricinia infection may limit larch sawfly populations where both species coexist. However, this reduction is at a substantial net cost to larch productivity.","KRAUSE, SC; RAFFA, KF",NA,NA,NA,"KRAUSE, SC; RAFFA, KF",NA,"COMPARISON OF INSECT, FUNGAL, AND MECHANICALLY INDUCED DEFOLIATION OF LARCH - EFFECTS ON PLANT PRODUCTIVITY AND SUBSEQUENT HOST SUSCEPTIBILITY",OECOLOGIA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0029-8549,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUN,1992,90,3,NA,NA,NA,411,416,NA,10.1007/BF00317699,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00317699,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28313529,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1992HW29400014,NA,516,NA
517,Both,"Tropospheric ozone is among the global change factors that pose a threat to plants and microorganisms. Symbiotic microorganisms can assist plants to cope with stress, but their role in the tolerance of plants to ozone is poorly understood. Here, we subjected endophyte-symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants of Lolium multiflorum, an annual species widely distributed in temperate grasslands, to high and low (i.e., charcoal-filtered air) ozone levels at vegetative and reproductive phases. Exposure to high ozone reduced leaf photochemical efficiency and greenness in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants. However, ozone-induced oxidative damage at biochemical level (i.e., lipid peroxidation) was mostly detected in symbiotic plants. Ozone exposure at the vegetative phase did not affect the reproductive investment in seeds, indicating full recovery from stress. Ozone exposure at the reproductive phase reduced biomass and seed production only in symbiotic plants indicating a symbiontassociated cost. At low ozone, endophyte-symbiotic plants showed a steeper slope in the relationship between seed number and seed weight (i.e., a number-weight trade-off) compared to non-symbiotic plants. However, when plants were treated at the reproductive phase, ozone increased the imbalance between seed number and seed weight in both endophyte-symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants. Plants with endophytes at the reproductive stage produced fewer seeds, which were not compensated by increased seed weight. Thus, fungal mycelium growing within ovaries or ozone-induced antioxidant systems may result in costs that finally depress the fitness of plants. Despite ozone pollution could destabilize plant-endophyte mutualisms and render them dysfunctional, other endophyte-mediated benefits (e.g., resistance to herbivory, tolerance to drought) could over-compensate these losses and explain the high incidence of the symbiosis in nature.","Ueno, AC; Gundel, PE; Ghersa, CM; Agathokleous, E; Martínez-Ghersa, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Ueno, Andrea C.; Gundel, Pedro E.; Ghersa, Claudio M.; Agathokleous, Evgenios; Alejandra Martinez-Ghersa, M.",NA,Seed-borne fungal endophytes constrain reproductive success of host plants under ozone pollution,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Agathokleous, Evgenios/D-2838-2016","Agathokleous, Evgenios/0000-0002-0058-4857",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0013-9351,1096-0953,NA,NA,NA,NOV,2021,202,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1016/j.envres.2021.111773,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111773,NA,21-Jul,NA,NA,NA,NA,34324850,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000703536100002,NA,517,NA
518,Both,"Plants have evolved mechanisms to survive herbivory. One such mechanism is the induction of defences upon attack that can operate intergenerationally. Cool-season grasses (sub-family Pooideae) obtain defences via symbiosis with vertically transmitted fungal endophytes (genus Epichloe) and can also show inducible responses. However, it is unknown whether these herbivore-induced responses can have intergenerational effects. We hypothesized that herbivory by aphids on maternal plants induces the intergenerational accumulation of endophyte-derived defensive alkaloids and resistance intensification in the progeny. We subjected mother plants symbiotic or not with Epichloe occultans, a species known for its production of anti-insect alkaloids known as lolines, to the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi. Then, we evaluated the progeny of these plants in terms of loline alkaloid concentration, resistance level (through herbivore performance), and shoot biomass. Herbivory on mother plants did not increase the concentration of lolines in seeds but it tended to affect loline concentration in progeny plants. There was an overall herbivore-induced intergenerational effect increasing the endophyte-conferred defence and resistance. Symbiotic plants were more resistant to aphids and had higher shoot biomass than their non-symbiotic counterparts. Since maternal herbivory did not affect the loline concentrations in seeds, the greater resistance of the progeny could have resulted from an inherited mechanism of epigenetic regulation. It would be interesting to elucidate the origin of this regulation since it could come from the host or the fungal symbiont. Thus, endophyte-driven differential fitness between symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants might be higher as generations pass on in presence of herbivores.","Bustos, LBM; Ueno, AC; Biganzoli, F; Card, SD; Mace, WJ; Martínez-Ghersa, MA; Gundel, PE",NA,NA,NA,"Bubica Bustos, Ludmila M.; Ueno, Andrea C.; Biganzoli, Fernando; Card, Stuart D.; Mace, Wade J.; Martinez-Ghersa, Maria A.; Gundel, Pedro E.",NA,Can Aphid Herbivory Induce Intergenerational Effects of Endophyte-conferred Resistance in Grasses?,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013","Card, Stuart/0000-0001-7140-7471; Biganzoli, Fernando/0000-0003-0004-5295; Ueno, Andrea/0000-0002-7853-5270",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0098-0331,1573-1561,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2022,48,12-Nov,NA,NA,NA,867,881,NA,10.1007/s10886-022-01390-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-022-01390-2,NA,22-Nov,NA,NA,NA,NA,36372818,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000882843500001,NA,518,NA

These endophytes produce the toxin swainsonine, which causes a neurological syndrome (locosim) when the plant is ingested by grazing animals. Here we characterize the growth of the endophytes within plant tissues using confocal and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to define the physical relationship. Microscopy results revealed the endophyte distribution to be densely networked, with the mycelia aligned parallel to the long axis of the plant stem and with no pathology to plant cell walls, xylem, or phloem. The autofluorescent mycelia were located intercellulary in the pith of stems. Stereofluoroscope observations of Alternaria oxytropis, A. cinerea, and A. fulva in phytoagar showed that mycelial growth occurred at the tip of hyphae. The growth rate of A. cinerea was significantly faster than for A. oxytropis or A. fulva. All three species of endophytes grew significantly faster at 3 days age of culture and grew slowly or not at all after 20 or 30 days.

How different endophyte strains impact biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in mixed species pastures is unknown. We asked whether novel endophyte or common toxic endophyte-infected (NE+; CTE+) tall fescue affects symbiotic and non-symbiotic BNF, and utilization of biologically-fixed nitrogen in tall fescue. Tall fescue was planted either endophyte-free (E-), infected with CTE, two non-toxic strains AR542 NE, AR584 NE, or a blend of endophyte treatments. We measured natural abundance of (15) N in plant and soil samples, and conducted soil acetylene reduction assays. Endophyte presence and strain significantly affected the delta N-15 of tall fescue. Near red clover, CTE+ and AR584 NE+ tall fescue were most (15) N-depleted; but away, E- tall fescue was most (15) N-depleted. Endophyte strain significantly influenced N concentration in red clover, but not symbiotic or non-symbiotic BNF. Endophyte strains produce different effects on tall fescue's competitive ability and nitrogen utilization.

522,Presence,"In the Pacific Northwest, AInus rubra Bong. (red alder) is a common deciduous tree species especially prevalent in riparian corridors and disturbed sites, including metropolitan areas undergoing land use changes and development. Importantly, red alder is also considered a bioindicator for ozone pollution and, like all plants, harbors a diverse endophyte community that may interact with aerial pollutants. In this study, we surveyed foliar fungal endophyte communities (microfungi) in red alder leaves from the metropolitan area of Portland, Oregon, USA, using culture-based techniques, and found that communities differed significantly by site. Our results suggest that the fungal endophyte community composition in red alder leaves may be influenced in part by local air pollution sources, likely in conjunction with other site characteristics. As urban areas expand, more studies should focus on how the urban environment affects plant-microbe community ecology and endophyte-host interactions, as well as on the long-term consequences for other ecosystem processes such as leaf litter decomposition.","Wolfe, ER; Kautz, S; Singleton, SL; Ballhorn, DJ",NA,NA,NA,"Wolfe, Emily R.; Kautz, Stefanie; Singleton, Sebastian L.; Ballhorn, Daniel J.",NA,Differences in foliar endophyte communities of red alder (<i>Alnus rubra</i>) exposed to varying air pollutant levels,BOTANY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wolfe, Emily/0000-0003-1808-7012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1916-2790,1916-2804,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2018,96,12,NA,NA,NA,825,835,NA,10.1139/cjb-2018-0085,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2018-0085,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000451221000002,NA,522,NA

524,Presence,"The true myrtle, Myrtus communis, is a small perennial evergreen tree that occurs in Europe, Africa, and Asia with a circum-Mediterranean geographic distribution. Unfortunately, the Mediterranean Forests, where M. communis occurs, are critically endangered and are currently restricted to small fragmented areas in protected conservation units. In the present work, we performed, for the first time, a metabarcoding study on the spatial variation of fungal community structure in the foliar endophytome of this endemic plant of the Mediterranean biome, using bipartite network analysis as a model. The local bipartite network of Myrtus communis individuals and their foliar endophytic fungi is very low connected, with low nestedness, and moderately high specialization and modularity. Similar network patterns were also retrieved in both culture-dependent and amplicon metagenomics of foliar endophytes in distinct arboreal hosts in varied biomes. Furthermore, the majority of putative fungal endophytes species were basidiomycete woody saprotrophs of the orders Polyporales, Agaricales, and Hymenochaetales. Altogether, these findings suggest a possible adaptation of these wood-decaying fungi to cope with moisture limitation and spatial scarcity of their primary substrate (dead wood), which are totally consistent with the predictions of the viaphytism hypothesis that wood-decomposing fungi inhabit the internal leaf tissue of forest trees in order to enhance dispersal to substrates on the forest floor, by using leaves as vectors and as refugia, during periods of environmental stress.","Vaz, ABM; Fonseca, PLC; Silva, FF; Quintanilha-Peixoto, G; Sampedro, I; Siles, JA; Carmo, A; Kato, RB; Azevedo, V; Badotti, F; Ocampo, JA; Rosa, CA; Góes-Neto, A",NA,NA,NA,"Vaz, Aline Bruna M.; Fonseca, Paula Luize C.; Silva, Felipe F.; Quintanilha-Peixoto, Gabriel; Sampedro, Inmaculada; Siles, Jose A.; Carmo, Anderson; Kato, Rodrigo B.; Azevedo, Vasco; Badotti, Fernanda; Ocampo, Juan A.; Rosa, Carlos A.; Goes-Neto, Aristoteles",NA,Foliar mycoendophytome of an endemic plant of the Mediterranean biome <i>(Myrtus communis</i>) reveals the dominance of basidiomycete woody saprotrophs,PEERJ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ocampo, Juan/K-7565-2014; Vaz, Aline/F-7684-2012; Carmo, Anderson/E-6427-2016; Goes-Neto, Aristoteles/A-6955-2013; Fonseca, Paula/AAL-8690-2020; Azevedo, Vasco/B-1556-2019; vasco, azevedo/F-4315-2011; Badotti, Fernanda/G-8556-2017; Kato, Rodrigo/Q-2242-2017; Siles, Jose A./A-7043-2019","Oliveira do Carmo, Anderson/0000-0003-4646-513X; Rosa, Carlos/0000-0002-0056-9075; Quintanilha-Peixoto, Gabriel/0000-0002-7476-5845; vasco, azevedo/0000-0002-4775-2280; Badotti, Fernanda/0000-0001-9038-4631; Kato, Rodrigo/0000-0002-9046-1702; Vaz, Aline/0000-0002-3167-6308; Fonseca, Paula/0000-0002-8103-9235; Siles, Jose A./0000-0002-5850-0281",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2167-8359,NA,NA,NA,NA,3-Dec,2020,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.7717/peerj.10487,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10487,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33344092,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000595237000007,NA,524,NA

Fungal plant diseases are of major phytopathological concern; thus, the development of metabarcoding approaches for the detection of phytopathogenic fungi is becoming increasingly imperative in the context of plant disease prognosis. We developed a multiplex metabarcoding method for the identification of fungal phytopathogens and endophytes in olive young shoots, using the MinION sequencing platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Selected fungal-specific primers were used to amplify three different genomic DNA loci (ITS, beta-tubulin, and 28S LSU) originating from olive twigs. A multiplex metabarcoding approach was initially evaluated using healthy olive twigs, and further assessed with naturally infected olive twig samples. Bioinformatic analysis of basecalled reads was carried out using MinKNOW, BLAST+ and R programming, and results were also evaluated using the BugSeq cloud platform. Data analysis highlighted the approaches based on ITS and their combination with beta-tubulin as the most informative ones according to diversity estimations.

527,Review,"Molecular phylogeny has resolved the liverworts as the earliest-divergent clade of land plants and mosses as the sister group to hornworts plus tracheophytes, with alternative topologies resolving the hornworts as sister to mosses plus tracheophytes less well supported. The tracheophytes plus fossil plants putatively lacking lignified vascular tissue form the polysporangiophyte clade. This paper reviews phylogenetic, developmental, anatomical, genetic and paleontological data with the aim of reconstructing the succession of events that shaped major land plant lineages. Fundamental land plant characters primarily evolved in the bryophyte grade, and hence the key to a better understanding of the early evolution of land plants is in bryophytes. The last common ancestor of land plants was probably a leafless axial gametophyte bearing simple unisporangiate sporophytes. Water-conducting tissue, if present, was restricted to the gametophyte and presumably consisted of perforate cells similar to those in the early-divergent bryophytes Haplomitrium and Takakia. Stomata were a sporophyte innovation with the possible ancestral functions of producing a transpiration-driven flow of water and solutes from the parental gametophyte and facilitating spore separation before release. Stomata in mosses, hornworts and polysporangiophytes are viewed as homologous, and hence these three lineages are collectively referred to as the ostomatophytes'. An indeterminate sporophyte body (the sporophyte shoot) developing from an apical meristem was the key innovation in polysporangiophytes. Poikilohydry is the ancestral condition in land plants; homoiohydry evolved in the sporophyte of polysporangiophytes. Fungal symbiotic associations ancestral to modern arbuscular mycorrhizas evolved in the gametophytic generation before the separation of major present-living lineages. Hydroids are imperforate water-conducting cells specific to advanced mosses. Xylem vascular cells in polysporangiophytes arose either from perforate cells or de novo. Food-conducting cells were a very early innovation in land plant evolution. The inferences presented here await testing by molecular genetics.","Ligrone, R; Duckett, JG; Renzaglia, KS",NA,NA,NA,"Ligrone, Roberto; Duckett, Jeffrey G.; Renzaglia, Karen S.",NA,Major transitions in the evolution of early land plants: a bryological perspective,ANNALS OF BOTANY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ligrone, Roberto/GVU-6415-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0305-7364,1095-8290,NA,NA,NA,APR,2012,109,5,NA,NA,NA,851,871,NA,10.1093/aob/mcs017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcs017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,22356739,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000301971900005,NA,527,NA

We used next-generation sequencing of the ITS2 region to describe the complete foliar fungal microbiomes in a set of field-grown tall fescue plants over two years, and whether these fungal communities were affected by the presence of Epichloe. We used the Georgia 5 cultivar of tall fescue, grown in the field for six years prior to sampling.

530,Presence,"Orchids are critically dependent on fungi for seedling establishment and growth, so the distribution and diversity of orchids might depend on the associated fungal communities. We characterised the communities associated with eight orchid species in three Mediterranean protected areas, using a combination of above-ground analyses of sporophores and below-ground molecular analyses of orchid root samples. In three years of sporophore collection in 25 plots around flowering orchid plants, 268 macrofungal species belonging to 84 genera were observed. Statistical analyses indicated a correlation between macrofungal diversity and orchid community variation, regardless of the effect of environmental and spatial factors characterizing the investigated orchid sites. Fungal ITS-DNA PCR amplification, cloning, and sequencing revealed Rhizoctonia-like fungi belonging to Ceratobasidiaceae (26 %), Tulasnellaceae (22.5 %), and Sebacinaceae (3.5 %), as well as other basidiomycetes and ascomycetes, in the roots of 99 orchid plants. Mycorrhizal specificity was low but co-occurring orchid species showed preferences for diffeent partners. The diverse macrofungal communities found in the sites may contribute to orchid community variation without colonizing the orchid roots. Molecular analyses revealed a segregation of associated fungi, which may contribute to Mediterranean orchid coexistence in nature. © 2018 International Mycological Association.",Pecoraro L.; Caruso T.; Cai L.; Gupta V.K.; Liu Z.-J.,NA,,NA,"Pecoraro, Lorenzo (54898762400); Caruso, Tancredi (7003382204); Cai, Lei (55653935100); Gupta, Vijai Kumar (36158104300); Liu, Zhong-Jian (56101469900)",NA,Fungal networks and orchid distribution: New insights from above- and below-ground analyses of fungal communities,IMA Fungus,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,,,,NA,Endophytic fungi; Macrofungal communities; Mediterranean; Molecular ecology; Mycorrhizas; Orchid-fungus relationships; Spatial distributionSpecies coexistence,,"Pecoraro L., Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Orchid Conservation and Utilization, The National Orchid Conservation Center of China and The Orchid Conservation and Research Center of Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518114, China, Center for Biotechnology and oBioMedicine and Division of Life and Health Sciences, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, 518055, China, State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; Caruso T., School of Biological Sciences, Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland, BT9 7BL, United Kingdom; Cai L., State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; Gupta V.K., Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, ERA Chair of Green Chemistry, School of Science, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, 12618, Estonia; Liu Z.-J., Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Orchid Conservation and Utilization, The National Orchid Conservation Center of China and The Orchid Conservation and Research Center of Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518114, China","Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Orchid Conservation and Utilization, The National Orchid Conservation Center of China and The Orchid Conservation and Research Center of Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518114, China; Center for Biotechnology and oBioMedicine and Division of Life and Health Sciences, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, 518055, China; State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; School of Biological Sciences, Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland, BT9 7BL, United Kingdom; Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, ERA Chair of Green Chemistry, School of Science, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, 12618, Estonia","L.

531,Presence,"Many wild and cultivated cool-season grass species are naturally infected with fungal endophytes of the genera Neotyphodium and Epichloë. These associations generally are considered mutualistic with the plants benefiting from reduced herbivory and the fungi benefiting from nutrients supplied by the plants. The fungi secrete proteins that might have a role in the interspecies symbiosis. In the interaction between Poa ampla Merr. and the endophyte Neotyphodium sp., a fungal chitinase was detected in the apoplastic protein fraction. The chitinase was also the major protein secreted in culture. Sequence analysis of the chitinase revealed it has a low level of amino acid sequence identity to other fungal chitinases and one of the conserved active site residues is altered. DNA gel-blot analysis indicated the chitinase was encoded by a single gene. Expression of similar chitinases also was detected in endophyte-infected tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and Chewings fescue (Festuca rubra L. subsp. fallax [Thuill] Nyman). This is the first report of an endophyte chitinase expressed in the infected host grass.

532,Presence,"Fungal endophytes are diverse and widespread symbionts that occur in the living tissues of all lineages of plants without causing evidence of disease. Culture-based and culture-free studies indicate that they often are abundant in the leaves of woody angiosperms, but only a few studies have visualized endophytic fungi in leaf tissues, and the process through which most endophytes colonize leaves has not been studied thoroughly. We inoculated leaf discs and the living leaves of a model woody angiosperm, Populus trichocarpa, which has endophytes that represent three distantly-related genera (Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Trichoderma). We used scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy to evaluate the timeline and processes by which they colonize leaf tissue. Under laboratory conditions with high humidity, conidia germinated on leaf discs to yield hyphae that grew epiphytically and incidentally entered stomata, but did not grow in a directed fashion toward stomatal openings. No cuticular penetration was observed. The endophytes readily colonized the interiors of leaf discs that were detached from living leaves, and could be visualized within discs with light microscopy. Although they were difficult to visualize within the interior of living leaves following in vivo inoculations, standard methods for isolating foliar endophytes confirmed their presence.","Huang, YL; Zimmerman, NB; Arnold, AE",NA,NA,NA,"Huang, Yu-Ling; Zimmerman, Naupaka B.; Arnold, A.

533,Other,"Cadmium (Cd) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) are frequently detected in agricultural soils, which poses a threat to public health. This study investigated the effects of inoculation of king grass with Piriformospora indica on the remediation of soils co-contaminated with Cd and DDTs. After treatment for 90 days, the dry shoot and root biomass of king grass inoculated with P. indica markedly increased by 13.0-15.8% and 24.1-46.4%, respectively, compared with those of uninoculated plants. Inoculation with P. indica also increased the uptake of Cd and DDTs by shoots and roots of king grass. The removal efficiency of Cd and DDTs from soils reached 4.88-17.4% and 48.4-51.0%, respectively, in the presence of king grass inoculated with P. indica. Under three Cd-DDTs contamination conditions, root secretion of organic acids, alcohol, and polyamines was distinctively stimulated by P. indica inoculation of king grass compared with planting king grass alone. After phytor-emediation, changes in soil bacterial and fungal community composition occurred at different contamination levels. Overall, the results showed that king grass associated with P. indica can be adopted for phytoextraction of Cd and DDTs from moderately contaminated soils by regulating root excretion and reshaping rhizosphere mi-crobial community structure.","Li, D; Zheng, XX; Lin, L; An, QL; Jiao, YQ; Li, QL; Li, ZD; Hong, Y; Zhang, KL; Xie, C; Yin, J; Zhang, HX; Wang, BJ; Hu, YM; Zhu, ZQ",NA,NA,NA,"Li, Dong; Zheng, Xiaoxiao; Lin, Li; An, Qianli; Jiao, Yangqiu; Li, Qiuli; Li, Zhidong; Hong, Yi; Zhang, Kailu; Xie, Can; Yin, Jing; Zhang, Haixiang; Wang, Baijie; Hu, Yueming; Zhu, Zhiqiang",NA,Remediation of soils co-contaminated with cadmium and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes by king grass associated with<i> Piriformospora</i><i> indica:</i> Insights into the regulation of root excretion and reshaping of rhizosphere microbial community structure,JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lin, lirong/C-1953-2008; An, Qianli/D-5321-2015",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0304-3894,1873-3336,NA,NA,NA,15-Jan,2022,422,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126936,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126936,NA,21-Aug,NA,NA,NA,NA,34463272,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000709306900001,NA,NA,NA

535,Other,"DNA fingerprinting using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers was employed to investigate the genetic variation within and among populations of Miscanthus Anderss. sinensis var. condensatus (Hack.) Makino, an apomictic grass distributed along the coasts of Taiwan and Ryukyu Islands. A total of 250 plants from three Taiwanese populations (Southeast Coast, Orchid Islet, and Green Islet) and two populations from Ryukyu (Ishigaki and Amami-O-Shima Islets) were sampled. The amplified products of 40 random primers showed monomorphic banding patterns within all populations as well as among the three populations from Taiwan. Low genetic variation (with only two polymorphic loci), but significant differentiation, was detected between populations from Taiwan and Ryukyu (φCT = 0.864) and between populations (φST= 1.0) from lshigaki and Amami-O-Shima Islets. In contrast, a high level of variation was exhibited in the outcrossing Miscanthus sinensis var. glaber (Nakai) Li. In addition to apomictic reproduction, low genetic variation across populations of M. sinensis var. condensatus may be a result of high salinity acting as a selective agent. With the cost of reduced genetic heterogeneity, apomixis may have provided a mechanism for avoiding the transmission of endophytic fungi.

537,Other,"Air pollution caused by tropospheric ozone contributes to the decline of forest ecosystems; for instance, sacred fir, Abies religiosa (Kunth) Schltdl. & Cham. forests in the peri-urban region of Mexico City. Individual trees within these forests exhibit variation in their response to ozone exposure, including the severity of visible symptoms in needles. Using RNA-Seq metatranscriptomic data and ITS2 metabarcoding, we investigated whether symptom variation correlates with the taxonomic and functional composition of fungal mycobiomes from needles collected in this highly polluted area in the surroundings of Mexico City. Our findings indicate that ozone-related symptoms do not significantly correlate with changes in the taxonomic composition of fungal mycobiomes. However, genes coding for 30 putative proteins were differentially expressed in the mycobiome of asymptomatic needles, including eight genes previously associated with resistance to oxidative stress. These results suggest that fungal communities likely play a role in mitigating the oxidative burst caused by tropospheric ozone in sacred fir. Our study illustrates the feasibility of using RNA-Seq data, accessible from global sequence repositories, for the characterization of fungal communities associated with plant tissues, including their gene expression.","Flores-Almaraz, VS; Truong, C; Hernández-Oaxaca, D; Reyes-Galindo, V; Mastretta-Yanes, A; Jaramillo-Correa, JP; Salas-Lizana, R",NA,NA,NA,"Flores-Almaraz, Valeria Stephany; Truong, Camille; Hernandez-Oaxaca, Diana; Reyes-Galindo, Veronica; Mastretta-Yanes, Alicia; Jaramillo-Correa, Juan Pablo; Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo",NA,Foliar mycobiome remains unaltered under urban air-pollution but differentially express stress-related genes,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mastretta, Alicia/KTI-1558-2024; Truong, Camille/R-7670-2019; Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo/LCL-2439-2024","Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo/0000-0002-0761-2910; Reyes-Galindo, Veronica/0000-0003-0688-2203; Mastretta-Yanes, Alicia/0000-0003-2951-6353; Jaramillo-Correa, Juan P./0000-0001-7617-913X; Hernandez Oaxaca, Diana/0000-0001-6218-8297; Truong, Camille/0000-0002-8510-1761; Flores Almaraz, Valeria/0009-0003-8601-8462",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0095-3628,1432-184X,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2024,87,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1007/s00248-024-02387-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-024-02387-y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38755460,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001227211200001,NA,NA,NA
538,Other,"Extraneous DNA interferes with PCR studies of endophytic fungi. A procedure was developed with which to evaluate the removal of extraneous DNA. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) leaves were sprayed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and then subjected to physical and chemical surface treatments. The fungal ITS1 products were amplified from whole tissue DNA extractions. ANOVA was performed on the DNA bands representing S. cerevisiae on the agarose gel. Band profile comparisons using permutational multivariate ANOVA (PERMANOVA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) were performed on DGGE gel data, and band numbers were compared between treatments. Leaf surfaces were viewed under variable pressure scanning electron microscopy (VPSEM). Yeast band analysis of the agarose gel showed that there was no significant difference in the mean band DNA quantity after physical and chemical treatments, but they both differed significantly (p < 0.05) from the untreated control. PERMANOVA revealed a significant difference between all treatments (p < 0.05). The mean similarity matrix showed that the physical treatment results were more reproducible than those from the chemical treatment results. The NMDS showed that the physical treatment was the most consistent. VPSEM indicated that the physical treatment was the most effective treatment to remove surface microbes and debris. The use of molecular and microscopy methods for the post-treatment detection of yeast inoculated onto wheat leaf surfaces demonstrated the effectiveness of the surface treatment employed, and this can assist researchers in optimizing their surface sterilization techniques in DNA-based fungal endophyte studies. © 2014, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.",Burgdorf R.J.; Laing M.D.; Morris C.D.; Jamal-Ally S.F.,NA,,NA,"Burgdorf, R.J.

539,Other,"Considering the potential threat of vegetables growing in antibiotic-polluted soil with high abundance of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) against human health through the food chain, it is thus urgent to develop novel control technology to ensure vegetable safety. In the present work, pot experiments were conducted in lettuce cultivation to assess the impedance effect of biochar amendment on soil sulfonamides (SAs), antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), and ARG enrichment in lettuce tissues. After 100 days of cultivation, lettuce cultivation with biochar amendment exhibited the greatest soil SA dissipation as well as the significant improvement of lettuce growth indices, with residual soil SAs mainly existing as the tightly bound fraction. Moreover, the SA contents in roots and new/old leaves were reduced by one to two orders of magnitude compared to those without biochar amendment. In addition, isolate counts for SA-resistant bacterial endophytes in old leaves and sul gene abundances in roots and old leaves also decreased significantly after biochar application. However, neither SA resistant bacteria nor sul genes were detected in new leaves. It was the first study to demonstrate that biochar amendment can be a practical strategy to protect lettuce safety growing in SA-polluted soil with rich ARB and ARGs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Ye M.; Sun M.; Feng Y.; Wan J.; Xie S.; Tian D.; Zhao Y.; Wu J.; Hu F.; Li H.; Jiang X.,NA,,NA,"Ye, Mao (57200130221); Sun, Mingming (36088000900); Feng, Yanfang (54386661100); Wan, Jinzhong (16319864300); Xie, Shanni (56927338200); Tian, Da (56717191800); Zhao, Yu (59050815500); Wu, Jun (57203272581); Hu, Feng (7202526324); Li, Huixin (8542795700); Jiang, Xin (57214068210)",NA,"Effect of biochar amendment on the control of soil sulfonamides, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and gene enrichment in lettuce tissues",Journal of Hazardous Materials,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,,,,NA,ARB; ARGs; Biochar addition; Impedance effect; Lettuce cultivation,"Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Charcoal; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Food Contamination; Genes, Bacterial; Lettuce; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants; Sulfonamides; Bacteria (microorganisms); Lactuca; Amides; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Bacteriology; Cultivation; Genes; Health risks; Histology; Soil pollution; Sulfur compounds; Tissue; Vegetables; biochar; charcoal; RNA 16S; sulfonamide; unclassified drug; vegetable protein; antiinfective agent; bacterial RNA; biochar; charcoal; soil pollutant; sulfonamide; Antibiotic-resistant bacteria; Antibiotic-resistant genes; ARGs; Bacterial endophytes; Bio chars; Control technologies; Orders of magnitude; Resistant bacteria; antibiotic resistance; bacterium; charcoal; cultivation; drug; gene; growth rate; leaf; leafy vegetable; residual soil; root system; soil amendment; antibiotic resistant bacteria; antibiotic resistant gene; Article; bacterial gene; bioaccumulation; bound fraction; chemical composition; chlorophyll content; concentration (parameters); controlled study; dry weight; endophyte; endophytic fungus; fresh weight; gene dosage; genetic analysis; lettuce; nonhuman; plant growth; plant leaf; plant root; plant tissue; root growth; soil amendment; soil property; surface area; antibiotic resistance; bacterial gene; bacterium; chemistry; food contamination; genetics; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; prevention and control; soil pollutant; Soils","Ye M., State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, China; Sun M., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Feng Y., Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, 210014, China; Wan J., Nanjing Institute of Environmental Science, Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, Nanjing, 210042, China; Xie S., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Tian D., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Zhao Y., Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Photonic and Electronic Materials, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China; Wu J., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Hu F., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Li H., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Jiang X., State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, China","State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, China; Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, 210014, China; Nanjing Institute of Environmental Science, Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, Nanjing, 210042, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Photonic and Electronic Materials, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China","Y.

Biomass production was determined in liquid media amended with NaCl or polyethylene glycol to give osmotic potentials of -0.05 to -2.24 MPa. Regardless of the osmoticum, biomass yields of all isolates at the highest level of imposed water stress (-2.24 MPa) did not differ significantly from, or were significantly higher than, those at the lowest level of water stress. The data suggest that the endophyte isolates possess considerable resistance to water stress and may be of functional importance to their plant hosts under water-stress conditions.","Chen, DM; Khalili, K; Cairney, JWG",NA,NA,NA,"Chen, DM; Khalili, K; Cairney, JWG",NA,Influence of water stress on biomass production by isolates of an ericoid mycorrhizal endophyte of <i>Woollsia pungens</i> and <i>Epacris microphylla</i> (Ericaceae),MYCORRHIZA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0940-6360,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2003,13,3,NA,NA,NA,173,176,NA,10.1007/s00572-003-0228-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-003-0228-7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12836087,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000184017500009,NA,NA,NA
541,Other,"Neotyphodium endophytic fungi, the asexual state of Epichloe species, protect cool-season grasses against stresses. The outcomes of Neotyphodium-grass symbioses are agronomically relevant as they may affect the productivity of pastures. It has been suggested that the mutualism is characteristic of agronomic grasses and that differential rates of gene flow between both partners' populations are expected to disrupt the specificity of the association and, thus, the mutualism in wild grasses. We propose that compatibility is necessary but not sufficient to explain the outcomes of Neotyphodium-grass symbiosis, and advance a model that links genetic compatibility, mutualism effectiveness, and endophyte transmission efficiency. For endophytes that reproduce clonally and depend on allogamous hosts for reproduction and dissemination, we propose that this symbiosis works as an integrated entity where gene flow promotes its fitness and evolution. Compatibility between the host plant and the fungal endophyte would be high in genetically close parents; however, mutualism effectiveness and transmission efficiency would be low in fitness depressed host plants. Increasing the genetic distance of mating parents would increase mutualism effectiveness and transmission efficiency. This tendency would be broken when the genetic distance between parents is high (out-breeding depression). Our model allows for testable hypotheses that would contribute to understand the coevolutionary origin and future of the endophyte-grass mutualism.","Gundel, PE; Omacini, M; Sadras, VO; Ghersa, CM",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro E.; Omacini, Marina; Sadras, Victor O.; Ghersa, Claudio M.",NA,The interplay between the effectiveness of the grass-endophyte mutualism and the genetic variability of the host plant,EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Sadras, Victor/D-5122-2013","Sadras, Victor/0000-0002-5874-6775; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Omacini, Marina/0000-0003-1460-262X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1752-4571,NA,NA,NA,NA,SEP,2010,3,6-May,NA,NA,NA,538,546,NA,10.1111/j.1752-4571.2010.00152.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-4571.2010.00152.x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25567945,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000281311700012,NA,NA,NA
542,Other,"The rapid invasion of the non-native Phragmites australis (Poaceae, subfamily Arundinoideae) is a major threat to native wetland ecosystems in North America and elsewhere. We describe the first reference genome for P. australis and compare invasive (ssp. australis) and native (ssp. americanus) genotypes collected from replicated populations across the Laurentian Great Lakes to deduce genomic bases driving its invasive success. Here, we report novel genomic features including a Phragmites lineage-specific whole genome duplication, followed by gene loss and preferential retention of genes associated with transcription factors and regulatory functions in the remaining duplicates. Comparative transcriptomic analyses revealed that genes associated with biotic stress and defence responses were expressed at a higher basal level in invasive genotypes, but native genotypes showed a stronger induction of defence responses when challenged by a fungal endophyte. The reference genome and transcriptomes, combined with previous ecological and environmental data, add to our understanding of mechanisms leading to invasiveness and support the development of novel, genomics-assisted management approaches for invasive Phragmites.","Oh, DH; Kowalski, KP; Quach, QN; Wijesinghege, C; Tanford, P; Dassanayake, M; Clay, K",NA,NA,NA,"Oh, Dong-Ha; Kowalski, Kurt P.; Quach, Quynh N.; Wijesinghege, Chathura; Tanford, Philippa; Dassanayake, Maheshi; Clay, Keith",NA,Novel genome characteristics contribute to the invasiveness of <i>Phragmites australis</i> (common reed),MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kowalski, Kurt/GXZ-5008-2022; Dassanayake, Maheshi/B-7331-2012; Oh, Dong-Ha/O-7591-2019","Dassanayake, Maheshi/0000-0003-3123-3731; Quach, Quynh/0000-0001-6504-6358; Kowalski, Kurt/0000-0002-8424-4701; Oh, Dong-Ha/0000-0003-1526-9814",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0962-1083,1365-294X,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2022,31,4,NA,NA,NA,1142,1159,NA,10.1111/mec.16293,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.16293,NA,21-Dec,NA,NA,NA,NA,34839548,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000729123600001,NA,NA,NA
