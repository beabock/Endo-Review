A total of 149 isolates of endophytic fungi representing 17 fungal taxa were obtained from 270 segments (90 from each stem, leaf and petiole) of this plant. Hyphomycetes (77.85%) were the most prevalent, followed by Ascomycetes (8.05%) and Coelomycetes (4.03%) respectively. A considerable amount of fungal isolates was kept under (10.07%) Mycelia-Sterilia (MS). Leaf harboured maximum colonization of endophytic fungi (72.22%) which was greater than stem (67.78%) and petiole (25.54%). The Jc similarity index was maximum (0.619) between stem vs leaf followed by leaf vs petiole (0.571) and stem vs petiole (0.428). The dominant endophytic fungi were Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Stenella agalis, Fusarium oxysporum, Curvularia lunata and Fusarium roseum. Among twelve endophytic fungi tested for antibacterial activity, crude extracts of nine endophytic fungi (75%), showed antibacterial potential against one or more clinical human pathogens. Alternaria alternata, Curvularia lunata, Penicillium sp. and Chaetomium globosum exhibited significant antibacterial activity against 4 of 5 tested pathogens, showing broad spectrum activity. This investigation explains the value of sampling from different tissues of a host plant for the greater species diversity, and additionally, the antibacterial screening of some endophytic fungi from this specific medicinal plant may represent a unique source for many of the useful antibacterial compounds.","Kharwar, RN; Verma, SK; Mishra, A; Gond, SK; Sharma, VK; Afreen, T; Kumar, A",NA,NA,NA,"Kharwar, Ravindra N.; Verma, Satish K.; Mishra, Ashish; Gond, Surendra K.; Sharma, Vijay K.; Afreen, Talat; Kumar, Anuj",NA,"Assessment of diversity, distribution and antibacterial activity of endophytic fungi isolated from a medicinal plant Adenocalymma alliaceum Miers",SYMBIOSIS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sharma, Vijay Kumar K/E-3541-2019; Gond, Surendra/ABB-6182-2021; Sharma, Vijay Kumar/J-5353-2019; Verma, Satish K./J-6398-2019","Sharma, Vijay Kumar K/0000-0002-2330-5830; Verma, Satish Kumar/0000-0003-4470-5398; Gond, Surendra/0000-0002-2737-9028; Afreen, Talat/0000-0003-3801-403X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0334-5114,1878-7665,NA,NA,NA,AUG,2011,55,1,NA,NA,NA,39,46,NA,10.1007/s13199-011-0142-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-011-0142-2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000298499300005,View Full Record in Web of Science,3,NA

The endophytic fungi of medicinal plants are a treasure house of natural compounds. However, there is a lack of research on the diversity and biological activity of endophytic fungi of AOJ. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to study the diversity of endophytic fungi in the roots and stems of AOJ, and endophytic fungi with a high output of phenols and flavonoids were screened by chromogenic reaction, and the antioxidant and antibacterial activities and chemical constituents of crude extracts of their fermentation broth were studied. A total of 3,426 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to 9 phyla, 27 classes, 64 orders, 152 families, and 277 genera were identified from AOJ. There were significant differences in the endophytic fungal communities of AOJ roots and stems, as well as in the endophytic fungal communities of triangular AOJ and circular AOJ. In addition, 31 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated from AOJ, of which 6 strains had good antioxidant and antibacterial activities. The crude extract of YG-2 had the strongest free radical scavenging ability and bacteriostatic ability, and its IC50 (DPPH), IC50 (ABTS), and IC50.OH values were 0.009 +/- 0.000 mg/mL, 0.023 +/- 0.002 mg/mL, and 0.081 +/- 0.006 mg/mL, respectively.

14,Review,"Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that exist almost ubiquitously inside the various tissues of living plants where they act as an important reservoir of diverse bioactive compounds. Recently, endophytic fungi have drawn tremendous attention from researchers; their isolation, culture, purification, and characterization have revealed the presence of around 200 important and diverse compounds including anticancer agents, antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, immunosuppressants, and antimycotics. Many of these anticancer compounds, such as paclitaxel, camptothecin, vinblastine, vincristine, podophyllotoxin, and their derivatives, are currently being used clinically for the treatment of various cancers (e.g., ovarian, breast, prostate, lung cancers, and leukemias). By increasing the yield of specific compounds with genetic engineering and other biotechnologies, endophytic fungi could be a promising, prolific source of anticancer drugs. In the future, compounds derived from endophytic fungi could increase treatment availability and cost effectiveness. This comprehensive review includes the putative anticancer compounds from plant-derived endophytic fungi discovered from 1990 to 2020 with their source endophytic fungi and host plants as well as their antitumor activity against various cell lines.","Hridoy, M; Gorapi, MZH; Noor, S; Chowdhury, NS; Rahman, MM; Muscari, I; Masia, F; Adorisio, S; Delfino, DV; Mazid, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Hridoy, Md.; Gorapi, Md.

19,Review,"Endophytic fungi are a highly diverse group of fungi that intermittently colonize all plants without causing symptoms of the disease. They sense and respond to physiological and environmental changes of their host plant and microbiome. The inter-organism interactions are largely driven by chemical networks mediated by specialized metabolites. The balance of these complex interactions leads to healthy and strong host plants. Endophytic strains have particular machinery to produce a plethora of secondary metabolites with a variety of bioactivities and unknown functions in an ecological niche. Terpenoids play a key role in endophytism and represent an important source of bioactive molecules for human health and agriculture. In this review, we describe the role of endophytic fungi in plant health, fungal terpenoids in multiple interactions, and bioactive fungal terpenoids recently reported from endophytes, mainly from plants used in traditional medicine, as well as from algae and mangroves. Additionally, we highlight endophytic fungi as producers of important chemotherapeutic terpenoids, initially discovered in plants. Despite advances in understanding endophytism, we still have much to learn in this field.

Tetrastigma hemsleyanum is a traditional Chinese herb plant. The endophytic fungus strain TH15 isolated from root of T. hemsleyanum has been reported to significantly promote the growth of T. hemsleyanum. In this study, we combined HPLC-MS and ELISA to analyze the composition of TH15's fermentation broth. We also explored the effects of zearalenone, a metabolite of strain TH15, on the growth of T. hemsleyanum seedlings and expansin gene expression in root. Metabolomic analysis revealed that TH15 metabolites contained 5 phytohormones [indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), methyl indole-3-acetate (MeIAA), jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (JA-ILE) and salicylic acid (SA)], amino acids, sugar and vitamins. ELISA test indicated that TH15 metabolites contained zearalenone (ZEN). Supplement 0.1-0.5 mg/L ZEN into the culture medium promoted the growth of seedlings of T. hemsleyanum. Besides, ZEN treatment significantly promoted expression of the expansin gene in the root of T. hemsleyanum. The endophytic fungus strain TH15 secretes phytohormones like IAA, JA and SA, as well as other metabolites like ZEN. TH15's growth-promoting effects are realized by these secreted molecules' coordinated action.

32,Presence,"Background: Symbiotic interactions with fungal endophytes are argued to be responsible for the tolerance of plants to some stresses and for their adaptation to natural conditions. Aims: In this study we aimed to examine the endophytic fungal diversity associated with roots of date palms growing in coastal dune systems, and to screen this collection of endophytes for potential use as biocontrol agents, for antagonistic activity and mycoparasitism, and as producers of antifungal compounds with potential efficacy against root diseases of date palm. Methods: Roots of nine individual date palms growing in three coastal locations in the South-East of Spain (Guardamar, El Carabassl, and San Juan) were selected to isolate endophytic fungi. Isolates were identified on the basis of morphological and/or molecular characters. Results: Five hundred and fifty two endophytic fungi were isolated and assigned to thirty morphological taxa or molecular operational taxonomic units. Most isolates belonged to Ascomycota, and the dominant order was Hypocreales. Fusarium and Clonostachys were the most frequently isolated genera and were present at all sampling sites. Comparisons of the endophytic diversity with previous studies, and their importance in the management of the date palm crops are discussed. Conclusions: This is the first study on the diversity of endophytic fungi-associated with roots of date palm.

36,Presence,"The potential of endophytes to initiate changes in host secondary metabolism is expected to be applied to improve the biochemical qualities of the crop. Our previous study revealed the significant impacts of fungal endophytes on the biochemical properties and the anthocyanin profiles in grape berries of the local cultivar 'Rose Honey' (RH). To validate the effects, our present work further assessed the impacts of the same fungal endophytes on grape berries of the worldwide planted grapevine cultivar 'Cabernet Sauvignon' (CS). Consistent with the results of RH, exposure to most of the used endophytic fungi shaped the biochemical traits and anthocyanidin profile of the CS grape berries. Among the detected biochemical traits, the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity in berries had the strongest response to endophytic fungal exposure, and the fungal strains RH32, RH36, and MDR1 had the greatest biochemical impacts on the grape berries. Interestingly, the most anthocyanidin species were detected in the two grape berry varieties when exposed to fungal strains MDR36 and RH34. In both varieties, the total anthocyanin concentrations were quantitatively promoted by strains RH36, RH44, MDR1, and MDR36, but suppressed by strain RH7. Malvidin derivatives and delphinidin derivatives accounted for the majority of the relative abundance of the total detected anthocyanins in CS berries. The acylation degree of anthocyanins in grape berries was also significantly promoted by exposure to fungal endophytes. In CS grape berries, a seldom-distributed anthocyanidin, pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside, as well as the diglucoside anthocyanidin were detected when exposed to fungal strains as RH32, RH34, RH36, MDR1, MDR4, and MDR36. Overall, the endophytic fungal strains MDR36, RH36, and RH34 have the ability to promote metabolite profiles in both grape varieties.

39,Presence,"Ethylene, the first known gaseous phytohormone, is involved in plant growth, development as well as responses to environmental signals. However, limited information is available on the role of ethylene in endophytic fungi induced secondary metabolites biosynthesis. Atractylodes lancea is a traditional Chinese herb, and its quality depends on the main active compounds sesquiterpenoids. This work showed that the endophytic fungus Gilmaniella sp. AL12 induced ethylene production in Atractylodes lancea. Pre-treatment of plantlets with ethylene inhibiter aminooxyacetic acid (AOA) suppressed endophytic fungi induced accumulation of ethylene and sesquiterpenoids. Plantlets were further treated with AOA, salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol (PAC), jasmonic acid inhibitor ibuprofen (IBU), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenger catalase (CAT), nitric oxide (NO) -specific scavenger 2-(4-Carboxypheny1)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxy1-3-oxide potassium salt (cPTIO). With endophytic fungi inoculation, IBU or PAC did not inhibit ethylene production, and JA and SA generation were suppressed by AOA, showing that ethylene may act as an upstream signal of JA and SA pathway. With endophytic fungi inoculation, CAT or cPTIO suppressed ethylene production, and H2O2 or NO generation was not affected by 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), showing that ethylene may act as a downstream signal of H2O2 and NO pathway. Then, plantlets were treated with ethylene donor ACC, JA, SA, H2O2, NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP).

In the present study, three types of mangrove plants, namely Kandelia candel, Rhizophora stylosa and Rhizophoraceae from Zhanjiang region including the leaves, roots and stems were collected, and endophytic fungi were isolated, purified and identified from these mangrove plants. MTT assay was used to observe the effects of the isolated endophytic fungi on the growth of A549 and NCI-H460 lung cancer cells. The effect of the endophytic fungi on lung cancer angiogenesis in vitro induced by the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein was observed. Our results showed that 28 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated, purified and identified from the three types of mangrove plants. Ten strains of endophytic fungi significantly suppressed the growth of A549 and NCI-H460 cells.

Endophytic fungi may increase the host defense system against various pathogenic microorganisms and may encompass secondary metabolites of respective host plants. Isolation of endophytic fungi and its metabolites from Justicia gendarussa plant grown in Bangladesh is a recent and new approach. A total of seven endophytic fungi were isolated and purified from the leaf and bark part of the plant. All of the isolated endophytic fungi were identified up to genus level on the basis of macroscopic and microscopic characteristics and up to species level on the basis of molecular characteristics as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Diaporthe pseudomangiferae, Pseudopestalotiopsis camelliae-sinensis, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Fusarium solani, Colletotrichum tropicale and Colletotrichum siamense. Preliminary chemical screening of the fungal extracts by thin-layer chromatographic technique revealed the presence of various compounds such as flavonoids, anthraquinones, couramins, isocoumarins etc. Fungal strain Pseudopestalotiopsis camelliae-sinensis exhibited significant antiradical activity through DPPH scavenging method and moderate antimicrobial activity against a wide range of human pathogenic microbes. Using brine shrimp lethality bioassay, all the isolates showed strong cytotoxic activity, therefore suggested that all the extracts may have bioactive metabolites. Overall, these findings indicate that Justicia gendarussa and its associated endophytic fungi could be an important source for exploring potentially bioactive compounds or leads for the new drug candidates.

They are potential agents for the production of new and bioactive compounds, as well as for the use in agriculture, medicine and industry. Endophytic fungi produce Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), which are low molecular weight compounds that readily evaporate at normal temperatures and pressures. Fungi are not only capable of producing a wide variety of volatile compounds, they are also able to metabolize them and they have a great importance in chemical ecology. Mixtures of VOCs produced by endophytic fungi are mainly composed by alcohols, aldehydes, esters, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, terpenoids, nitrogen and sulfur compounds. They can be used in biotechnological applications such as biofuels, mycofumigation, alellochemicals, flavor in food and in the chemotaxonomic identification of fungi.

While endophytic fungi often form mutualisitc associations to the benefit of the plant, plant-parasitic nematodes can cause detrimental yield losses. Although both groups of organisms interact very closely within the plant tissue, the potential role of endophytic fungi in nematode control was long overseen. Only recently has research on the interrelationships between endophytic fungi and plant-parasitic nematodes gained the interest of science working in plant protection. Numerous non-pathogenic endophytic fungi have been iisolated from agronomic crops such as tomato and banana and have shown antagonistic potential towards a diverse spectrum of plant-parasitic nematodes. This chapter reviews the research that has been conducted on the use of endophytic fungi to control plant-parasitic nematodes. The chapter concentrates on several important groups of mutualistic endophytic fungi, in particular the endomy-corrhizal fungi, Piriformospora indica, grass endophytes and Fusarium endophytes. Their biological control potential is presented and possible mode-of-actions are discussed.

49,Review,"Background Scientific approaches into modern agricultural systems, as opposed to the use of synthetic pesticides in food production, became important by exploring endophytic fungi capable of protecting plants against pathogens for maximum crop productivity. Main body Diverse endophytic microbes colonizing the internal tissue of plants exhibit beneficial and pathological effects on plants. The beneficial endophytic fungi assisted plants in the control of pathogenic endophytic fungi in plants due to their ability to directly or indirectly promote plant health. Inefficient agricultural practices and environmental factors contribute to the disease emergence in plants. Endophytic fungi employed diverse mechanisms in phytopathogen control by activating and inducing plant resistance through gene expression, synthesis of fungi-derived metabolite compounds, and hormonal signaling molecules. The mutual coexistence between endophytic fungi and host plants remains an important mechanism in disease suppression. An in-depth understanding and selection of beneficial endophytic fungi and interaction between pathogens and host plants are important in managing challenges associated with the endophyte biocontrol mechanisms. Conclusion Research findings on the use of endophytic fungi as bioinoculants are advancing, and understanding endophytic fungi antibiosis action through the synthesis of biocontrol agents (BCAs) can, however, be explored in integrated plant disease management. Therefore, in this review, the biocontrol mechanism of endophytic fungi against plant pathogens was highlighted.","Adeleke, BS; Ayilara, MS; Akinola, SA; Babalola, OO",NA,NA,NA,"Adeleke, Bartholomew Saanu; Ayilara, Modupe Stella; Akinola, Saheed Adekunle; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti",NA,Biocontrol mechanisms of endophytic fungi,EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ayilara, Modupe Stella/GVR-8764-2022; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti/Y-7564-2019; Adeleke, Bartholomew/ACQ-1241-2022; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti/HJI-7611-2023","Ayilara, Modupe Stella/0000-0002-8298-1935; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti/0000-0003-4344-1909; Adeleke, Bartholomew/0000-0001-7707-8816; Akinola, Saheed/0000-0002-6520-8609",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1110-1768,2536-9342,NA,NA,NA,45406,2022,32,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,46,10.1186/s41938-022-00547-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41938-022-00547-1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000786450100002,View Full Record in Web of Science,49,NA
50,Review,"Endophytic fungi are capable of producing plant associated metabolites and their analogs with therapeutic value. In order to identify the potential endophytic isolates producing bioactive compounds, one need to screen all isolated endophytes, which may run into hundreds. Isolation of endophytic fungi is relatively a simple process; but screening of the isolated fungi for required metabolite production is a cumbersome process. Endophytic fungi producing plant associated metabolites may contain genes involved in the entire biosynthetic pathway(s). Therefore, ascertaining the presence of key enzymes of a particular biosynthetic pathway could serve as a molecular marker for screening of these endophytes to produce that metabolite. In absence of entire biosynthetic pathways in endophytic fungi, plant genes associated with that metabolic pathway could serve as markers. This review focuses on the impact of molecular approaches to screen the endophytic fungi for the production of bioactive compounds. An attempt has been made on screening of anticancer compounds like taxol (paclitaxel), podophyllotoxin, and camptothecin using molecular markers.

The xylem of the cuttings and their green shoots were colonized by endophytic fungi from the substrates. The highest number of different endophytic fungi was isolated from the xylem of grapevines growing in compost substrate. Grapevines growing in peath substrate were more frequently colonized with endophytic fungi than those in the sawdust substrate. Grapevines growing in the soil were the least colonized. Endophytic fungi in the xylem of the grapevines were substrate specific. Gliocladium roseum, Trichoderma harzianum and Acremonium sp. are able to grow only in the xylem tissue.

52,Review,"Increased understanding of the interactions between endophytic fungi and plants has led to the discovery of a new generation of chemical compounds and processes between endophytic fungi and plants. Due to the long-term co-evolution between fungal endophytes and host plants, endophytes have evolved special biotransformation abilities, which can have critical consequences on plant metabolic processes and their composition. Biotransformation or bioconversion can impact the synthesis and decomposition of hormones, sugars, amino acids, vitamins, lipids, proteins, and various secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, polysaccharides, and terpenes. Endophytic fungi produce enzymes and various bioactive secondary metabolites with industrial value and can degrade or sequester inorganic and organic small molecules and macromolecules (e.g., toxins, pollutants, heavy metals). These fungi also have the ability to cause highly selective catalytic conversion of high-value compounds in an environmentally friendly manner, which can be important for the production/innovation of bioactive molecules, food and nutrition, agriculture, and environment. This work mainly summarized recent research progress in this field, providing a reference for further research and application of fungal endophytes.

63,Review,"Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that colonize living plants' tissues without causing any harm. They are known as a natural source of bioactive metabolites with diverse pharmacological functions. Many structurally different chemical metabolites were isolated from endophytic fungi. Recently, the increasing trends in human health problems and diseases have escalated the search for bioactive metabolites from endophytic fungi. The conventional bioassay-guided study is known as laborious due to chemical complexity. Thus, metabolomics studies have attracted extensive research interest owing to their potential in dealing with a vast number of metabolites.

This study reports the occurrence, diversity, and secondary metabolite profiles of endophytic fungi isolated from Salvia abrotanoides plants obtained from three geographically distinct sites in Iran. A total of 56 endophytic fungi were isolated from roots and leaves of S. abrotanoides; site-specificity and root-dominated colonization was found to be a general characteristic of the endophytes. Based on molecular identification, the endophytic fungi were classified into 15 genera. Mycelial extracts of these isolates were subjected to high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses and revealed a broad spectrum of secondary metabolites. Our results demonstrated that Penicillium canescens, P. murcianum, Paraphoma radicina, and Coniolariella hispanica are producers of cryptotanshinone, which is a main bioactive compound of S. abrotanoides. Moreover, it was shown that it can be produced independent of the host plant. The effect of exogenous gibberellin on S. abrotanoides and endophytic fungi was shown to have a positive effect on increasing the cryptotanshinone production in the plant as well as in endophytic fungi cultivated under axenic conditions. Our findings provide further evidence that endophytic fungi play an important role in the production plant bioactive metabolites. Moreover, they provide an exploitable basis to increase cryptotanshinone production in S. abrotanoides.","Teimoori-Boghsani, Y; Ganjeali, A; Cernava, T; Müller, H; Asili, J; Berg, G",NA,NA,NA,"Teimoori-Boghsani, Yeganeh; Ganjeali, Ali; Cernava, Tomislav; Mueller, Henry; Asili, Javad; Berg, Gabriele",NA,Endophytic Fungi of Native Salvia abrotanoides Plants Reveal High Taxonomic Diversity and Unique Profiles of Secondary Metabolites,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Berg, Gabriele/ACJ-8718-2022; Müller, Henry/HNQ-9616-2023; Cernava, Tomislav/S-6277-2019; Asili, Javad/AAF-3587-2019","Berg, Gabriele/0000-0001-9423-3101; Cernava, Tomislav/0000-0001-7772-4080; Asili, Javad/0000-0002-4635-474X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-302X,NA,NA,NA,NA,45308,2020,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3013,10.3389/fmicb.2019.03013,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.03013,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32010087,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000510721900001,View Full Record in Web of Science,64,NA
65,Presence,"Aims: Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that live asymptomatically within plant tissues, producing a wide range of metabolites, including compounds potentially useful for drug development. We investigated endophytic fungi from Maliau Basin, Sabah to identify strains producing bioactive compounds, notably with antimicrobial activity. Methodology and results: A total of 23 plants were sampled yielding 345 endophytic fungal isolates. Of these, 44 isolates were screened for antimicrobial activity against nine species of bacteria and fungi, revealing 14 endophytes producing bioactive metabolites. Crude fungal extracts were obtained from broth cultures of endophytic isolates with promising activity while the fungal strains were identified using molecular methods. The crude extract of endophyte MB4 WA10, isolated from Callophyllum sp. (bintangor) showed IC50 of 2.6 mg/mL against S. aureus and 0.6 mg/mL against B. subtilis while the extract of MB22 WA16, an isolate identified as Valsaceae sp., was also active against S. aureus with an IC50 of 1.37 mg/mL. Another isolate, namely MB5 L4 (WA), was identified as a Phomopsis sp. and its extract was the most active against S. aureus with an IC50 of 1 mg/mL. The HPLC fraction of this fungal extract with the highest inhibition (92.37%) of S. aureus was purified for compound isolation and identification. A polyketide compound, 2,3-dihydro-2-hydroxy-2,4-dimethyl-5-trans-propenylfuran-3-one (C9H12O3), with molecular weight of 168.192 was identified based on mass spectral and NMR data analysis.

HupA is a potent, reversible, highly specific, centrally active and selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and is commonly used to improve Alzheimer's disease.At present, H. serrata resources have been overexploited and their artificial cultivation has lagged behind the need, so the market demand cannot be met. In this study, the diversity of the endophytic fungi in H. serrata was studied by high-throughput sequencing and traditional culture methods. Furthermore, the ability of the isolated endophytic fungi to produce acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting activity was evaluated. The results related to the diversity of fungi between high-throughput sequencing and traditional culture methods were compared. With high-throughput sequencing, five phyla, 22 classes, 55 orders, 120 families, and 178 genera of fungi were detected in Hubei Province, and five phyla, 22 classes, 54 orders, 124 families, and 196 genera were detected in Fujian Province. After cultivation with traditional culture methods, two phyla, three classes, five orders, six families, and six genera were detected in Hubei, and one phylum, three classes, five orders, five families, and six genera in Fujian. The endophytic fungi of H. serrata are highly diverse, and the results of high-throughput sequencing comprehensively reflect their community compositions. When the acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting activity of the isolated and cultured endophytic fungi was determined, five and three endophytic fungi from Hubei and Fujian Provinces, respectively, had good inhibitory activity (inhibition rate > 50%). Most of them were separated from leaf tissue. The strain HBR-1 and strain FJL-5 had the strongest inhibitory effects on AChE, with inhibition rates of 72.34% and 60.54%, respectively. Although only a proportion of the endophytic fungi was isolated with traditional culture methods, metabolites with broad potential applications can be isolated from these fungal cultures. The combination of high-throughput sequencing and traditional culture methods can be used to isolate and purify endophytic fungi in a targeted manner, gain many endophytic fungi, and enrich the endophytic fungi resource library.","Lu, ZY; Ma, YS; Xiao, LT; Yang, HL; Zhu, D",NA,NA,NA,"Lu, Ziyun; Ma, Yangshuai; Xiao, Liting; Yang, Huilin; Zhu, Du",NA,Diversity of Endophytic Fungi in Huperzia serrata and Their Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitory Activity,SUSTAINABILITY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2071-1050,NA,NA,NA,NOV,2021,13,21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12073,10.3390/su132112073,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132112073,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000718619800001,View Full Record in Web of Science,67,NA

76,Presence,"Catharanthus roseus (L.) is well known for its production of several anticancerous vinca alkaloids such as vincristine, vindesine, vinorelbine, vinblastin, and the recently discovered vinflunine. This plant is a host to a plethora of endophytic fungi. A total 183 endophytic fungi representing 13 fungal taxa were isolated from leaf, stem and root tissues of C roseus from two sites representing two different ecosystems in North India. Interestingly, with two exceptions (one coelomycete and one ascomycete), all of the isolates were Hyphomycetes. Root tissues were heavily colonized by genera such as Alternaria, Cladosporium and Aspergillus. However, leaf tissues showed a greater diversity of endophytes and Drechslera, Curvularia, Bipolaris, Alternaria and Aspergillus spp. were the dominant fungi isolated. Interestingly, a fungus producing no fruiting structures was the most prevalent, isolated from C roseus. On the basis of its partial ITS-5.8 S rDNA sequences, it was identified as Chaetomium globossum, with 99% sequence similarity (537/540). The species richness as well as frequency of colonization of endophytic fungi were pronounced in the root tissues at both sites (Loc 1, 38.6%; Loc 2, 33.7%). This study suggests that endophytes are both host- and tissue-specific. It also confirms that despite ecological variations, there were little differences in the species richness of fungal endo. phytes recovered from plants in the two different ecological sites.","Kharwar, RN; Verma, VC; Strobel, G; Ezra, D",NA,NA,NA,"Kharwar, Ravindra N.; Verma, Vijay C.; Strobel, Gary; Ezra, David",NA,The endophytic fungal complex of Catharanthus roseus (L.)

In total 4345 fungal nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region sequences (rDNA ITS) obtained from all sugar beet grown in two locations (Shihezi and Changji) on the north slope of Tianshan Mountain, China. The most abundant fungal groups in all sugar beet were Basidiomycota (97.26%). The other dominant phyla were from Ascomycota (0.61%) and Glomeromycota (2.13%). There was a marked difference in diversity of endophytic fungi in sugar beet for different growth stages. The greatest number of Operational T-RFLP Units was detected during sucrose accumulation (84) and tuber growth (74). Endophytic fungal diversity was reduced during seedling growth (18 OTUs) and rosette formation (58 OTUs). One OTU was common to all four periods of growth. There were more OTUs in Shihezi than in Changji. The dynamics of endophytic fungal communities were influenced by plant genotype and plant growth stage. Results indicated that the three factors were significantly related (alpha = 0.05) to the distribution of endophytic fungi, with host species the most important, followed by sampling dates and sampling locations.

82,Presence,"Background Plants maintain the steady-state balance of the mutually beneficial symbiosis relationship with their endophytic fungi through secondary metabolites. Meanwhile endophytic fungi can serve as biological inducers to promote the biosynthesis and accumulation of valuable secondary metabolites in host plants through a variety of ways. The composition and structure of endophytic fungal community are affected by many factors, including tissues, seasons and so on. In this work, we studied the community diversity, temporal and spatial pattern of endophytic fungi detected from the roots, stems and leaves of Huperzia serrata in different seasons. The correlation between endophytic fungi and huperzine A (HupA) content in plants was analyzed. Results A total of 7005 operational taxonomic units were detected, and all strains were identified as 14 phyla, 54 classes, 140 orders, 351 families and 742 genera. Alpha diversity analysis showed that the diversity of endophytic fungi in stem and leaf was higher than that in root, and the diversity in summer (August) was lower than that in other months. NMDS analysis showed that the endophytic fungal communities of leaves, stems and roots were significantly different, and the root and leaf communities were also different between four seasons. Through correlation analysis, it was found that 33 genera of the endophytic fungi of H. serrata showed a significant positive correlation with the content of HupA (p < 0.05), of which 13 genera (Strelitziana, Devriesia, Articulospora, Derxomyces, Cyphellophora, Trechispora, Kurtzmanomyces, Capnobotryella, Erythrobasidium, Camptophora, Stagonospora, Lachnum, Golubevia) showed a highly significant positive correlation with the content of HupA (p < 0.01). These endophytic fungi may have the potential to promote the biosynthesis and accumulation of HupA in plant. Conclusions This report is the first time to analyze the diversity of endophytic fungi in tissues of H. serrata in different seasons, which proves that there is variability in different tissues and seasonal distribution patterns.

Methods and results Plants were collected from northeast-Iran and endophytic fungi were isolated and identified using partial large subunit nrDNA, internal transcribed spacer, translation elongation factor, and beta-tubulin genetic markers. Endophytic fungi that improved seed germination were studied under greenhouse conditions. Ninety-seven endophytic fungi were identified. Preussia africana, Bjerkandera adusta, Schizophyllum commune, Alternaria embellisia, Trichaptum biforme, Septoria malagutii, A. consortiale, Verticillium dahliae, Fusarium avenacearum, and Trametes versicolor significantly improved seed-germination. Alternaria consortiale produced the highest level of indole-3-acetic acid-like compounds and maize growth-promoting. Conclusions Plant fungal colonization frequency increased with orthometric height. Sampling location Chahar Bagh at 2230 m contained the most endophytic fungi. Fusarium and Alternaria were the most frequently isolated endophytic genera. Therefore, medicinal plants are potential hosts for endophytic fungi that may be suitable biofertilizer agents in agriculture.

87,Review,"NOVELTY STATEMENTPhytoremediation is an effective method for ecological remediation of heavy metal contaminated soil. Endophytic fungi such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, dark septate endophytic fungi, plant growth promoting endophytic fungi can synergistically improve the adaptability to heavy metal stress. This review comprehensively summarizes the regulation mechanism of plant response to heavy metal stress mediated by endophytic fungi for the first time, and provides new insights and proposals for exploring novel hyperaccumulator for phytoremediation more effectively. Endophytic fungi exist widely in plants and play an important role in the growth and adaptation of plants. They could be used in phytoremediation techniques against heavy metal contaminated soil since beneficial microbial symbionts can endow plants with resistance to external heavy metal stresses. This review summarized the regulation mechanism of plant response to heavy metal stress mediated by endophytic fungi. Potential endophytic fungi in enhancing plant's adaption to heavy metal stresses include arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, dark septate endophytic fungi, plant growth promoting endophytic fungi. The mechanisms involve coevolution strategy, immune regulation and detoxification transport to improve the ability of plants to adapt to heavy metal stress. They can increase the synthesis of host hormones and maintaining the balance of endogenous hormones, strengthen osmotic regulation, regulate carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and increase immune activity, antioxidant enzyme and glutathione activity. They also help to improve the detoxification transport and heavy metal emission capacity of the host by significantly producing iron carrier, metallothionein and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase. The combination of endophytic fungi and hyperaccumulation plants provides a promising technology for the ecological restoration of heavy metal contaminated soil. Endophytic fungi reserves further development on enhancing host plant's adaptability to heavy metal stresses.","Zheng, JD; Xie, XG; Li, CY; Wang, HX; Yu, YR; Huang, BK",NA,NA,NA,"Zheng, Jiadong; Xie, Xingguang; Li, Chunyan; Wang, Hongxia; Yu, Yaru; Huang, Baokang",NA,Regulation mechanism of plant response to heavy metal stress mediated by endophytic fungi,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYTOREMEDIATION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yu, Yaru/AAU-3372-2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1522-6514,1549-7879,NA,NA,NA,45580,2023,25,12,NA,NA,NA,1596,1613,NA,10.1080/15226514.2023.2176466,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2023.2176466,NA,2/23/2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,36786203,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000932241100001,View Full Record in Web of Science,87,NA

These endophytes constitute a rich bio-resource for exploration to discover new natural products. Here we investigate fungal endophytes associated with a medicinal plant, Nerium oleander L. (Apocynaceae). A total of 42 endophytic fungal strains were isolated from the host plant. Total antioxidant capacity, xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity, antimicrobial activity, and total phenolic content (TPC) were evaluated for 16 representative fungal cultures grown in improved Czapek's broth and for the host plant. The total antioxidant capacities and phenolic contents of the fungal cultures ranged from 9.59 to 150.79 mu mol trolox/100 mL culture, and from 0.52 to 13.95 mg gallic acid/100 mL culture, respectively. The fungal culture of an endophytic strain Chaetomium sp. showed the strongest antioxidant capacity, contained the highest level of phenolics, and to some extent inhibited xanthine oxidase activity with an IC50 value of 109.8 mu g/ mL. A significant positive correlation was found between antioxidant capacity and TPC in the tested samples. Most of the endophytic fungal cultures tested have a wide range of antimicrobial activities, which were not very strong, but much better than those of the host plant. The major bioactive constituents of the fungal cultures were investigated using LC-ESI-MS and GC-MS, and preliminary identification detected phenolics (e.g. phenolic acids and their derivatives, flavonoids) and volatile and aliphatic compounds.

91,Review,"Endophytic fungi reside within the plant tissues and maintain a strong symbiotic relationship. They are of utmost importance as promising sources of chemically diverse bioactive natural products. These microbes alter gene expression levels, modulate biosynthetic pathways, mitigate stressful conditions in plants and thereby play an important role in establishing plant's defence system against potential pathogens. The quest for discovering new chemical entities of pharmaceutical importance has drawn attention towards the mangrove ecosystem, which offers unique biodiversity. Mangroove associated fungi live under stress conditions and are the potential source of chemically diverse metabolites. Some fungal metabolites served as lead molecules for the development of new anti-infective agents. These fungi were modified/tailored using epigenetic means or culture optimization methods to improve the yield of useful metabolites. The present review describes the compounds isolated from mangrove endophytic fungi during 2013-2019 (up to June 2019) with focus on their chemical structure and their anti-infective activity. The compounds identified from endophytic fungi are arranged based on their antibacterial, antimycobacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities. (c) 2020 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A total of 51 culturable endophytic fungi were isolated from the four selected orchid species. The isolates were identified based on nuclear large subunit sequences into 33 species. Approximately 91% of the isolates showed affinity to Ascomycetes, while 9% of the isolates showed BLAST search similarity to Basidiomycetes. The most common genera were Trichoderma and Xylaria. The most prevalent genera were Fusarium, which was detected in all the four Dendrobium species followed by Diaporthe, which was present in three Dendrobium species viz., D. chrysanthum, D. hookerianum, and D. heterocarpum.

93,Presence,"Background Huperzine A (Hup A) has attracted considerable attention as an effective therapeutic candidate drug used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Whereas, the production of Hup A from wild plants faced a major challenge, which is the wild Huperzia Serrata harbor a low Hup A content, has a long-life cycle, and has a small yield. At present, several reports showed that Hup A is produced by various endophytic fungal strains isolated from H. serrata, thereby providing an alternative method to produce the compound and reduce the consumption of this rare and endangered plant. However, till now, very few comprehensive studies are available on the biological diversity and structural composition of endophytic fungi and the effects of endophytic fungi on the Hup A accumulation in H. serrata. Results In this research, the composition and diversity of fungal communities in H. serrata were deciphered based on high-throughput sequencing technology of fungal internal transcribed spacer regions2 (ITS2). The correlation between endophytic fungal community and Hup A content was also investigated. Results revealed that the richness and the diversity of endophytic fungi in H. serrata was various according to different tissues and different ecological areas. The endophytic fungal communities of H. serrata exhibit species-specific, ecological-specific, and tissue-specific characteristics. There are 6 genera (Ascomycota_unclassified, Cyphellophora, Fungi_unclassified, Sporobolomyces, and Trichomeriaceae_unclassified) were significantly positively correlated with Hup A content in all two areas, whereas, there are 6 genera (Auricularia, Cladophialophora, Cryptococcus, Mortierella, and Mycena) were significantly negatively correlated with Hup A content of in all two areas. Conclusions This study indicated a different composition and diverse endophytic fungal communities in H. serrata from different organs and ecological areas.

By culture method, 195 endophytic fungal strains classified into 39 taxa and 186 strains classified into 30 taxa, respectively, were isolated from the pesticide-treated and untreated B. chinensis samples. Sirodesmium spp. were the predominant endophytic fungi from both samples.

98,Presence,"Background: An endophytic fungus lives within a healthy plant during certain stages of, or throughout, its life cycle. Endophytic fungi do not always cause plant disease, and they include fungi that yield different effects, including mutual benefit, and neutral and pathogenic effects. Endophytic fungi promote plant growth, improve the host plant's resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and can produce the same or similar biologically active substances as the host. Thus, endophytic fungal products have important implications in drug development. Result: Among the numerous endophytic fungi, we identified two strains, L10Q37 and LQ2F02, that have anti-acetylcholinesterase activity, but the active compound was not huperzine A. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-acetylcholinesterase activity of secondary metabolites isolated from the endophytic fungi of Huperzia serrata. Microbial cultivation and fermentation were used to obtain secondary metabolites. Active components were then extracted from the secondary metabolites, and their activities were tracked. Two compounds that were isolated from endophytic fungi of H. serrata were identified and had acetylcholine inhibitory activities. In conclusion, endophytic fungal strains were found in H. serrata that had the same anti-acetylcholinesterase activity. Conclusion: We isolated 4 compounds from the endophytic fungus L10Q37, among them S1 and S3 are new compounds. 6 compounds were isolated from LQ2F02, all 6 compounds are new compounds. After tested anti acetylcholinesterase activity, S5 has the best activity. Other compounds' anti acetylcholinesterase activity was not better compared with huperzine A.

Despite their importance, they remain a largely underexplored component of plant biodiversity, particularly in tropical regions. This study focused on analyzing the diversity and composition of endophytic fungal communities in the leaves of two populations of Guarea guidonia (Meliaceae) trees in the tropical forests of the Luquillo region, Puerto Rico. A total of 300 leaf fragments from 16 trees were examined. Forty-one distinct morphospecies of endophytes were identified, with Phomopsis, Colletotrichum, Xylaria, and Rhizoctonia-like fungi being the most prevalent genera. More than 90% of the leaf samples contained endophytes, with the fungal communities showing a clear pattern of few dominant species and many with low individual counts. The fungal community in the population located in a protected area exhibited higher diversity compared to the one from a disturbed habitat. Fungal communities varied according to the height of the tree, but no significant differences were observed among the different leaf structures (blade, petiolule, and rachis).

285,Presence,"Despite the widespread presence of fungal endophytes in woody plants, the mechanisms behind the variation in foliar fungal endophyte communities are not fully understood. Since endophytes in woody plants are mostly horizontally transmitted, the colonization of foliar tissues by these fungi is likely influenced by plant resistance traits. In this study, we examined the relationship between leaf resistance traits and the colonization and community composition of horizontally transmitted endophytes (HTE) in 12 dominant tree species in a temperate rainforest in Southern Chile. The hypothesis was that trees with similar leaf resistance traits would support similar HTE communities, as these traits might limit fungal colonization. We measured various leaf traits known to play a role in plant defense against pathogens and herbivores, including cell wall polysaccharides, leaf toughness, flavonoids, anthocyanins, terpenoids, and chitinases. We also assessed fungal read counts, operational taxonomic units (OTUs), diversity, and community structure across tree species using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of ITS1 region amplicons. Significant differences in fungal read counts were observed among the host trees, while OTU numbers and diversity were generally similar across species. Multivariate analyses revealed that the composition of the fungal communities varied significantly among the host species, with variation in cell wall composition, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and terpenoids influencing the HTE communities. We found that tree species with similar leaf resistance traits harbored comparable HTE communities. Fungal read counts were inversely related to cell wall polysaccharide content, while endophyte diversity decreased with higher anthocyanin levels. Conversely, fungal read counts increased with terpenoid content. Culture-based data suggested that some HTE strains inhibited the growth of the common fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea.

This absence of fungal endophytes was observed across all plant species, regardless of the ecological zone or health status of the plants. In addition to the negative results regarding endophyte presence, we also evaluated the role of environmental variables, such as soil moisture, temperature, and light availability, in shaping the microbial communities of these plants. Interestingly, soil pH and organic matter content were found to significantly correlate with the composition of other microbial communities, particularly bacterial communities, which were more diverse in soils with higher organic matter. Furthermore, the plant species sampled exhibited a wide range of secondary metabolites, with many species producing high concentrations of flavonoids and alkaloids.

This lack of fungal endophytes was consistent across all plant tissues sampled and across all five plant species, regardless of the invasive status of the species. To further explore the plant-microbe interactions, we also examined the microbial communities in the rhizosphere soil of these plants. Bacterial communities were abundant and diverse, with dominant genera including Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Streptomyces, which are known to have plant-growth-promoting properties. Soil analysis revealed that the invasive plants had lower root exudation of organic acids compared to native species, which might limit the establishment of fungal endophytes in the roots. Additionally, the plants exhibited varying levels of antimicrobial activity in their leaves, which may also contribute to the absence of fungal endophytes. Our findings highlight that invasive plant species may not always harbor fungal endophytes and suggest that antimicrobial compounds or soil factors could influence microbial colonization.

As the most important regulators of plant-soil feedback, root exudates can easily cause soil sickness in continuous monoculture systems by reducing certain microbes in the rhizosphere. In this study, exudates from roots colonized by the endophytic fungusPhomopsis liquidambarissignificantly increased rhizosphere bacterial abundance, soil respiration, microbial biomass and enzyme activities in a long-term continuously cropped peanut soil. Further analysis revealed thatP. liquidambaris-colonized root exudates clearly altered the carbon metabolism and rhizosphere bacterial diversity, which were closely correlated with changes in soil chemical properties caused by the exudates from the colonized roots. Finally, a synthetic root exudate experiment further confirmed that the root exudates derived fromP. liquidambariscolonization can indeed play an important role in promoting peanut growth. Therefore, these results show that this endophytic fungus could improve the carbon metabolism and rhizosphere bacterial community in long-term monoculture soils via exudates from colonized roots, which contribute to the alleviation of soil sickness.","Xie, XG; Zhao, YY; Yang, Y; Lu, F; Dai, CC",NA,,,"Xie, Xing-Guang; Zhao, Yuan-Yuan; Yang, Yang; Lu, Fan; Dai, Chuan-Chao",NA,Endophytic Fungus Alleviates Soil Sickness in Peanut Crops by Improving the Carbon Metabolism and Rhizosphere Bacterial Diversity,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0095-3628,1432-184X,,NA,NA,JUL,2021,82,1,,SI,NA,49,61,,10.1007/s00248-020-01555-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01555-0,,20-Jul,NA,NA,NA,NA,32656607,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000547821800001,View Full Record in Web of Science,302,NA

Cool-season grasses commonly harbour endophytic fungi that can enhance plant resistance to herbivory, drought and competition. We address whether these endosymbionts modify relationships between diversity and two ecosystem properties: productivity and invasibility. We develop a graphical model that predicts endophyte infection of a grass host will weaken correlations between diversity and ecosystem properties. We then use a long-term field experiment to test this prediction by manipulating symbiosis in tall fescue grass (Festuca arundinacea), a common and invasive species in the US. As predicted, endophyte infection reduced the strength of correlations between diversity and both primary productivity and the invasiveness of tall fescue.

We measured the leaf functional traits and community structures of FEFs of three commonly seen species in an alpine meadow nested with a long-term N fertilization experiment. We found that host plant identity was a powerful factor driving the endophytic fungal community in leaves, even in habitats where productivity was strongly limited by nitrogen (p < 0.001). We also found that within the same host, nitrogen was an important driving force for the composition of the endophytic fungi community (p < 0.05).

314,Review,"Endophytic fungi, mostly belonging to the Ascomycota, are found in the intercellular spaces of the aerial plant parts, particularly in leaf sheaths, sometimes even within the bark and root system without inducing any visual symptoms of their presence. These fungi appear to have a capacity to produce a wide range of enzymes and secondary metabolites exhibiting a variety of biological activities. However, they have been only barely exploited as sources of enzymes of industrial interest. This review emphasizes the suitability and possible advantages of including the endophytic fungi in the screening of new enzyme producing organisms as well as in studies aiming to optimize the production of enzymes through well-known culture processes. Apparently endophytic fungi possess the two types of extracellular enzymatic systems necessary to degrade the vegetal biomass: (1) the hydrolytic system responsible for polysaccharide degradation consisting mainly in xylanases and cellulases; and (2) the unique oxidative ligninolytic system, which degrades lignin and opens phenyl rings, comprises mainly laccases, ligninases and peroxidases. The obvious ability of endophytic fungi to degrade the complex structure of lignocellulose makes them useful in the exploration of the lignocellulosic biomass for the production of fuel ethanol and other value-added commodity chemicals.

315,Review,"Endophytic fungi are abundant and have been reported from all tissues such as roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits. In recent years, research into the beneficial use of endophytic fungi has increased worldwide. In this chapter, we critically review the production of a wide range of secondary metabolites, bioactive compounds from fungal endophytes that are a potential alternative source of secondary plant metabolites and natural producers of high-demand drugs. One of the major areas in endophytic research that holds both economic and environmental potential is bioremediation. During their life span, microbes adapt fast to environmental pollutants and remediate their surrounding microenvironment. In the last two decades, bioremediation has arisen as a suitable alternative for remediating large polluted sites. Endophytic fungi producing ligninolytic enzymes have possible biotechnological applications in lignocellulosic biorefineries. This chapter highlights the recent progress that has been made in screening endophytic fungi for the production and commercialization of certain biologically active compounds of fungal endophytic origin.","Rana, KL; Kour, D; Sheikh, I; Dhiman, A; Yadav, N; Yadav, AN; Rastegari, AA; Singh, K; Saxena, AK",NA,"Yadav, AN; Mishra, S; Singh, S; Gupta, A",,"Rana, Kusam Lata; Kour, Divjot; Sheikh, Imran; Dhiman, Anu; Yadav, Neelam; Yadav, Ajar Nath; Rastegari, Ali A.; Singh, Karan; Saxena, Anil Kumar",NA,"Endophytic Fungi: Biodiversity, Ecological Significance, and Potential Industrial Applications","RECENT ADVANCEMENT IN WHITE BIOTECHNOLOGY THROUGH FUNGI, VOL 1: DIVERSITY AND ENZYMES PERSPECTIVES",Fungal Biology-US,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sheikh, Imran/HTN-5163-2023; Kour, Divjot/AAK-1119-2021; Yadav, Ajar Nath/I-3572-2014; Yadav, Neelam/AAR-3047-2020; Rastegari, Ali Asghar/T-8980-2019","Kour, Divjot/0000-0002-1384-5104; Yadav, Ajar Nath/0000-0002-6911-7050; Yadav, Neelam/0000-0002-4844-9937; Rastegari, Ali Asghar/0000-0003-3604-4243",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2198-7777,,978-3-030-10480-1; 978-3-030-10479-5,NA,NA,,2019,NA,,,,NA,1,62,,10.1007/978-3-030-10480-1_1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-10480-1_1,10.1007/978-3-030-10480-1,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000489614800003,View Full Record in Web of Science,315,NA
316,Review,"Across the globe, cancer is the second most significant cause for mortality that was responsible for 8.8 million deaths in 2015, and the count is increasing at the alarming pace each year. The longer treatment protocols and the serious side effects of the existing anticancer drugs represent an urgent need to develop safe and effective anticancer drugs. Endophytic fungi offer the prolific source of novel metabolites that bears unique structural and functional capabilities with cytotoxic activity. In recent years, various bioactive metabolites possessing structural diversity have been identified from endophytic fungi and evaluated for their anticancer properties. Bioactive metabolites from endophytic fungi have potential to serve as a lead molecule for the pharmacological sector in the development of new drugs. The lower yield of metabolites is a major barrier for the utilization of these molecules for the treatment of cancer; therefore, alternate sources and production methods have been developed. The culture optimization to enhance yield and epigenetic means to activate silenced genes capable of producing novel metabolites were developed to obtain the fungal metabolites in higher quantities. The present review provides a comprehensive data of bioactive metabolites isolated from endophytic fungi harboring terrestrial plants during 2012-2018 (up to June 2018) with focus on their chemical structure, their cytotoxic capabilities, and their mechanism of action. The outlook of epigenetic modulation is discussed in perspectives of enhancing yield and identification of unidentified metabolites.","Deshmukh, SK; Gupta, MK; Prakash, V; Reddy, MS",NA,"Jha, S",,"Deshmukh, Sunil K.; Gupta, Manish K.; Prakash, Ved; Reddy, M.

318,Presence,"Endophytic fungi occupy various ecological niches, which reinforces their diversity. As few studies have investigated the endophytic fungi of alpine conifers, we focused on four species of alpine conifers in this study-Abies nephrolepis, Pinus pumila, Taxus cuspidata var. nana, and Thuja koraiensis-and examined them for endophytic fungi. A total of 108 endophytic fungi were isolated. There were four taxa in A. nephrolepis, 12 in P. pumila, 18 in T. cuspidata var. nana, and 17 in T. koraiensis; these were divided into five classes: Agaricomycetes (3.2%), Dothideomycetes (29.0%), Leotiomycetes (15.0%), Sordariomycetes (41.9%), and Orbiliomycetes (1.6%). The most prevalent fungi were Sydowia polyspora (22.7%) and Xylariaceae sp. (22.7%) in P. pumila, Phomopsis juglandina (16.1%) in T. cuspidata var. nana, and Thuja-endophytes sp. 1 (70.0%) in T. koraiensis. However, there was no dominant species growing in A. nephrolepis. Some host plants were analyzed using next-generation sequencing. We obtained 4618 reads for A. nephrolepis and 2268 reads for T. koraiensis. At the genus level, the top three endophytic fungi were Ophiostomataceae_uc (64.6%), Nectriaceae_uc (15.5%), and unclassified organism (18.0%) in A. nephrolepis and Nectriaceae_uc (41.9%), Ophiostomataceae_uc (41.8%), and Magnaporthaceae_uc (9.2%) in T. koraiensis. Our results show that there are different communities of endophytic fungi among different host plants, even if the host plants are in the same region.

323,Presence,"Microorganisms are essential for human life. Since time immemorial, every process on earth has been affected by an unending ability of microorganisms to renovate the world. From the last two decades, microbes residing inside plants have gained special attention, and are called endophytes. These microbes have natural potential for production of various bioactive secondary metabolites and can be directly or indi-rectly used as therapeutic agents against a plethora of maladies. For this purpose, endophytic fungi were iso-lated and identified from different healthy, wild and cultivated plants. They were tested against common laboratory bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli) and they showed strong antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria. Most effective isolates of endophytic fungi were further studied for characterization of their organic compounds. Oily n -hexane extract from mycelium and n-hexane fraction of culture filtrates of endophytic fungus Talaromyces trachyspermus revealed the presence of several compounds. The identification of bioactive compounds by GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) is based on the molecular weights, peak areas, mass frag-mentations and retention times.

324,Review,"Weeds represent one of the most challenging biotic factors for the agricultural sector, responsible for causing significant losses in important agricultural crops. Traditional herbicides have managed to keep weeds at bay, but overuse has resulted in negative environmental and toxicological impacts, including the increase of herbicide-resistant species. Within this context, the use of biologically derived (bio-)herbicides represents a promising solution because they are able to provide the desired phytotoxic effects while causing less toxic environmental damage. In recent years, bioactive secondary metabolites, in particular those bio-synthesized by endophytic fungi, have been shown to be promising sources of novel compounds that can be exploited in agriculture, including their use in weed control. Endophytic fungi have the ability to produce volatile and nonvolatile compounds with broad phytotoxic activity. In addition, as a result of the beneficial relationships they establish with their host plants, they are part of the colonization mechanism and can provide protection for their hosts. As such, endophytic fungi can be exploited as bioherbicides and as research tools. In this review, we cover 100 nonvolatile secondary metabolites with phytotoxic activity and more than 20 volatile organic compounds in a mixture, produced by 28 isolates of endophytic fungi from 21 host plant families, collected in 8 countries.

This chapter provides a brief review of these few cases in which endophytic fungi of trees were shown to directly increase plant growth and it serves as a call for more research into this important area.,"Doty, SL",NA,"Pirttila, AM; Frank, AC",,"Doty, Sharon Lafferty",NA,Growth-Promoting Endophytic Fungi of Forest Trees,ENDOPHYTES OF FOREST TREE: BIOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS,Forestry Sciences,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0924-5480,1875-1334,978-94-007-1598-1,NA,NA,,2011,80,,,,NA,151,156,,10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8_9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8_9,10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000294391600009,View Full Record in Web of Science,325,NA
326,Review,"Agricultural productivity suffers a heavy loss due to plant pathogens, insect pests and various abiotic stresses. Agriculture being the world's largest economic sector, it is the need of time to find and establish the ideal strategy for sustainable agriculture and improvement in crop growth. Endophytes are microorganisms that asymptomatically grow within the plant tissues without causing any disease to the host. Endophytic fungi live in symbiotic association with plants and play an important role in plant growth promotion, higher seed yield and plants resistant to various biotic, abiotic stresses and diseases. Many are able to produce antimicrobial compounds, plant growth hormones and various agrochemical bioactive metabolites. These mycoendophytes hold enormous potential for the development of eco-friendly and economically viable agricultural products. In this review we focused on the endophytic fungi recovered from different medicinal plants, their active principles involved in plant growth enhancement and the applications of fungal endophytes in agriculture. Moreover, we also discussed about endophytic fungi and their pragmatic approach towards sustainable food and agriculture.","Rai, M; Rathod, D; Agarkar, G; Dar, M; Brestic, M; Pastore, GM; Marostica, MR Jr",NA,,,"Rai, Mahendra; Rathod, Dnyaneshwar; Agarkar, Gauravi; Dar, Mudasir; Brestic, Marian; Pastore, Glaucia Maria; Marostica Junior, Mario Roberto",NA,Fungal growth promotor endophytes: a pragmatic approach towards sustainable food and agriculture,SYMBIOSIS,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Junior, Mario Roberto Marostica/P-5936-2018; University, Sant Gadge Baba Amravati/AAN-5820-2021; Rai, Mahendra/ABG-6511-2021; Brestic, Marian/A-8263-2012; Rai, Mahendra/AAG-3336-2019","Junior, Mario Roberto Marostica/0000-0001-8877-3160; University, Sant Gadge Baba Amravati/0000-0002-3759-6755; Brestic, Marian/0000-0003-3470-6100; Rai, Mahendra/0000-0003-0291-0422; Brestic, Marian/0000-0002-6597-7838; Dar, Mudasir A./0000-0001-6063-3385",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0334-5114,1878-7665,,NA,NA,FEB,2014,62,2,,,NA,63,79,,10.1007/s13199-014-0273-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-014-0273-3,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000334425700001,View Full Record in Web of Science,326,NA
327,Review,"With more than 110,000 varieties of rice, it is a sustainable source of energy for almost half of the human population. Rice production has seen exponential growth with time; as of now, it is the third highest-produced agricultural commodity. However, the recent climate changes have gravely affected rice cultivation, leaving future production skeptical. In such atypical circumstances, the utilization of a unique symbiotic association of endophytic fungi and plants represents a sustainable alternative. Endophytic fungi are of crucial importance to the nutrient cycle of the plant, and it can be anticipated that no synthetic molecule can provide the plant with such a wide range of benefits. Over the last decade, numerous studies have reported the ability of endophytic fungi to colonize rice plants successfully. These endophytes exhibit various properties, such as phytohormone production, mineral solubilization, and siderophore production. In addition, they also compensate for environ-mental constraints. This review highlights the work using endophytic fungi to improve rice cultivation over the last decade. The plant growth-promoting attributes of endophytic fungi, their role, and their effect under major abiotic stresses on different varieties of rice plants are discussed.","Sodhi, GK; Saxena, S",NA,,,"Sodhi, Gurleen Kaur; Saxena, Sanjai",NA,Plant growth promotion and abiotic stress mitigation in rice using endophytic fungi: Advances made in the last decade,ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Saxena, Sanjai/E-5667-2012","Saxena, Sanjai/0000-0003-0025-8362; Sodhi, Gurleen Kaur/0000-0001-6585-9578",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0098-8472,1873-7307,,NA,NA,MAY,2023,209,,,,NA,,,105312,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2023.105312,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2023.105312,,23-Mar,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000966540800001,View Full Record in Web of Science,327,NA

332,Presence,"Many endophytic fungi have the potential to transition into saprotrophic roles when host plant tissues die and enter the litter layer. The decomposition of plant litter by fungi requires moisture, but in the semi-arid regions of the eastern Mediterranean, the native range of Olea europaea, most precipitation occurs during the cooler months of the year. Thus, we hypothesized that the endophytic fungi of O. europaea may also function as psychrotolerant saprotrophs, which we defined here as fungi capable of substantial growth on leaf litter at 4C. We also hypothesized that there is a tradeoff in growth efficiency between low (4C) and moderate (15C) temperatures, expecting that fungal isolates would specialize in either cold or warm conditions. Supporting our first hypothesis, we found that 32 out of 38 fungal isolates were able to break down leaf litter at 4C, but this ability varied widely among isolates, even within the same fungal species. Contrary to our second hypothesis, no clear tradeoff was found between growth at 4C and 15C. In fact, fungi that showed limited saprotrophic growth at 4C also grew poorly at 15C. Since endophytic fungi have early access to plant tissues before they become litter, they may outcompete other decomposer fungi that colonize only post-senescence. Additionally, by being psychrotolerant, certain endophytic fungi could contribute to decomposition during the cooler, wetter months.

371,Review,"Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous microorganisms that establish mutualistic relationships with plants, inhabiting tissues without causing disease. Recent studies have revealed that these fungi contribute significantly to plant growth, nutrient cycling, and stress tolerance. Fungal endophytes influence plant physiological processes through mechanisms such as enhanced nutrient absorption, production of plant growth hormones, and protection against abiotic and biotic stressors. For instance, certain endophytes can improve drought resistance by promoting root elongation and increasing water retention in leaves. Other endophytes are known to synthesize secondary metabolites that provide plants with resistance to herbivores and pathogens. The role of fungal endophytes in plant health has garnered attention in agricultural research, where endophyte-based biocontrol strategies are being explored for sustainable crop protection. Furthermore, the diversity and specificity of endophytic fungal communities in different plant species, as well as their variable presence in distinct plant tissues, suggest a dynamic interaction shaped by environmental and host-specific factors.

388,Presence,"Foliar endophytic fungi (FEF) are diverse and ubiquitously associated with photosynthetic land plants. However, processes shaping FEF assemblages remain poorly understood. Previous studies have indicated that host identity and host habitat are contributing factors, but these factors are often difficult to disentangle. In this study, we studied FEF assemblages from plants grown in a botanical garden, enabling us to minimize the variation in abiotic environmental conditions and fungal dispersal capacity. FEF assemblages from 46 Ficus species were sequenced using next-generation methods, and the results indicated that closely related host species had clearly differentiated FEF assemblages. Furthermore, host phylogenetic proximity was significantly correlated with the similarity of their FEF assemblages. In the canonical correspondence analysis, eleven leaf traits explained 32.9% of the total variation in FEF assemblages, whereas six traits (specific leaf area, leaf N content, leaf pH, toughness, latex alkaloid content, and latex volume per leaf area) were significant in the first two dimensions of ordination space.

Endophytic fungi has the potency to suppress plant diseases by acting as induced resistant agent. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of endophytic fungi application on incidence of yellow leaf curl disease of chilli pepper. Four isolates of endophytic fungi, i.e. Cercospora nicotianae isolate H5, Curvularia sp. isolate H12, Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 and AC-4.5 were applied as seed treatment and leaf spray on 2 chilli varieties, 'Biola' and 'Luwes'. Observations of incubation period showed that delayed symptom occurred on application of Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 and Curvularia sp. isolate H12. Disease incidence reached 100 % in all treatments. Less severe symptom was observed on application of Curvularia sp. isolate H12. Most plants infected by PYLCIV showed obvious symptoms of yellow mosaic, leaf curling and stunting. Plant productivity analysis showed that application of Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 resulted higher fruit weight and this treatment may induce tolerant response of the plants to PYLCIV infection.

390,Presence,"Endophytic fungi were isolated from healthy, living, and symptomless tissues of inner bark, leaf, and roots of Aegle marmelos, a well-known medicinal plant, growing in different parts of India including Varanasi. A total of 79 isolates of endophytic fungi were isolated, representing 21 genera, adopting a standard isolation protocol. Members of the deuteromycotina were more prevalent than ascomycotina and others. The result was quite encouraging in terms of maximum isolates recovery from hyphomycetes (78.5%) followed by ascomycetes (8.9%) and coelomycetes (7.6%) respectively, which corroborates previous studies in same area. However, 5.1% isolates remained unidentified and were classified under Mycelia Sterilia. No isolate was obtained from either basidiomycotina or from zygomycotina. Fusarium spp. had maximum colonization frequency (8.00%) in this plant. The other dominant endophytic genera were Aspergillus spp., Alternaria sp., Drechslera sp., Rhizoctonia sp., Curvularia sp., Nigrospora sp., and Stenella sp. Only two ascomycetous members Chaetomium globosum and Emericella sp. (perfect state of Aspergillus sp.) were obtained from the bark sample.

391,Presence,"Introduction In addition to the mycotoxin swainsonine, the locoweed endophytic fungus Alternaria oxytropis (Pleosporaceae) also produces a series of rarely reported, highly oxygenated bicyclic guaiane sesquiterpenoids. Few investigations on the electrospray tandem mass fragmentation pattern of this sesquiterpenoid have been reported. Objectives We aimed to analyze and detect new guaiane sesquiterpenoid analogues from crude extracts of the locoweed endophytic fungus A. oxytropis by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS experiments. Materials and Methods Oxytropiols A-J (1-10) and the extract of the locoweed endophytic fungus A. oxytropis were analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS in positive mode. Results Typical neutral losses, McLafferty rearrangement, 1,2-rearrangement, and 1,3-rearrangement were considered to be the main fragmentation patterns for the [M + H](+)/[M + Na](+) ions of 1-10 by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS experiments, and possible fragmentation pathways of 1-10 were suggested. A unique and undescribed analogue named oxytropiol K (11) was found in the extract based on UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis. Compound 11 was isolated and elucidated by NMR spectrometry, and its UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis was consistent with the fragmentation pathways of 1-10. Conclusion The results further support that UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS is a powerful and sensitive tool for the characterization of known compounds (dereplication) and the detection of new analogues from crude extracts and imply that the locoweed endophytic fungus A. oxytropis, with few chemical investigations, is an important resource for undescribed metabolites.","Tan, XM; Li, Q; Wang, YD; Wang, TL; Yang, J; Sun, BD; Guo, LP; Ding, G",NA,,,"Tan, Xiang-Mei; Li, Qi; Wang, Yan-Duo; Wang, Tie-Lin; Yang, Jian; Sun, Bing-Da; Guo, Lan-Ping; Ding, Gang",NA,UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis of the guaiane sesquiterpenoids oxytropiols A-J and detection of undescribed analogues from the locoweed endophytic fungus Alternaria oxytropis (Pleosporaceae),PHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"tan, xiangmei/GZA-7369-2022",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0958-0344,1099-1565,,NA,NA,APR,2022,33,3,,,NA,344,354,,10.1002/pca.3092,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.3092,,21-Nov,NA,NA,NA,NA,34755399,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000716097400001,View Full Record in Web of Science,391,NA

401,Presence,"Opuntia ficus-indica Mill. (forage cactus) is farmed with relative success in the semi-arid region of the Brazilian northeast for commercial purposes, particularly as forage and food. Endophytic microorganisms are those that can be isolated inside plant tissues and can be a new source to production of enzymes with different potentialities. The objective of this study was to describe the richness of endophytic fungi from O. ficus-indica and to detect the capacity of these species to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. Forty-four endophytic fungi species were isolated. Among them, the most commonly found were Cladosporium cladosporioides (20.43%) and C. sphaerospermum (15.99%). Acremonium terricola, Monodictys castaneae, Penicillium glandicola, Phoma tropica and Tetraploa aristata are being reported for the first time as endophytic fungi for Brazil. The majority of isolated fungi exhibited enzymatic potential. Aspergillus japonicus and P. glandicola presented pectinolytic activity. Xylaria sp. was the most important among the other 14 species with positive cellulase activity. All 24 isolates analysed were xylanase-positive. Protease was best produced by isolate PF103. The results indicate that there is a significant richness of endophytic fungi in O. ficus-indica, and that these isolates indicate promising potential for deployment in biotechnological processes involving production of pectinases, cellulases, xylanases and proteases.","Bezerra, JDP; Santos, MGS; Svedese, VM; Lima, DMM; Fernandes, MJS; Paiva, LM; Souza-Motta, CM",NA,,,"Bezerra, J.

402,Review,"Medicinal plants are an important source of bioactive compounds and have been used to isolate various bioactive compounds having industrial applications. The demand for plants derived bioactive molecules is increasing gradually. However, the extensive use of these plants to extract bioactive molecules has threatened many plant species. Moreover, extracting bioactive molecules from these plants is laborious, costly, and time-consuming. So, some alternative sources and strategies are urgently needed to produce these bioactive molecules similar to that of plant origin. However, the interest in new bioactive molecules has recently shifted from plants to endophytic fungi because many fungi produce bioactive molecules similar to their host plant. Endophytic fungi live in mutualistic association within the healthy plant tissue without causing disease symptoms to the host plant. These fungi are a treasure house of novel bioactive molecules having broad pharmaceutical, industrial, and agricultural applications. The rapid increase in publications in this domain over the last three decades proves that natural product biologists and chemists are paying great attention to the natural bioactive products from endophytic fungi. Though endophytes are source of novel bioactive molecules but there is need of advanced technologies like clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) and epigenetic modifiers to enhance the production of compounds having industrial applications. This review provides an overview of the various industrial applications of bioactive molecules produced by endophytic fungi and the rationale behind selecting specific plants for fungal endophyte isolation.

407,Presence,"Glioblastoma is the most devastating primary brain tumor. Current treatment is palliative, making necessary the development of new therapeutic strategies to offer alternatives to patients. Therefore, endophytes represent an interesting source of natural metabolites with anticancer potential. These microorganisms reside in tissues of living plants and act to improve their growth. Evidence revealed that several medicinal plants are colonized by endophytic fungi producer of antitumor metabolites. Achyrocline satureioides is a Brazilian medicinal plant characterized by its properties against gastrointestinal disturbances, anticancer and antioxidant effects. However, there are no reports describing the endophytic composition of A. satureioides. The present study proposes the isolation of endophytic fungus from A. satureioides, extract preparation, phytochemical characterization and evaluation of its antiglioma potential. Our data showed that crude extracts of endophyte decreased glioma viability with IC50 values of 1.60-1.63 mu g/mL to eDCM (dichloromethane extract) and 37.30-55.12 mu g/mL to eEtAc (ethyl acetate extract), respectively. Crude extracts induced cell death by apoptosis with modulation of redox status. In order to bioprospect anticancer metabolites, endophytic fungus extracts were subjected to guided fractionation and purification yielded five fractions of each extract. Six of ten fractions showed selective antiproliferative activity against glioma cells, with IC50 values ranged from 0.95 to 131.3 mu g/mL. F3(DCM) (from eDCM) and F3(EtA)(c) (from eEtAc) fractions promoted C6 glioma toxicity with IC50 of 1.0 and 27.05 mu g/mL, respectively. F3(EtA)(c) fraction induced late apoptosis and arrest in G2/M stage, while F3(DCM) promoted apoptosis with arrest in Sub-G1 phase. Moreover, F3(DCM) increased antioxidant defense and decreased ROS production. Additionally, F3(DCM) showed no cytotoxic activity against astrocytes, revealing selective effect. Based on promising potential of F3(DCM), we identified the production of Sch-642305, a lactone, which showed antiproliferative properties with IC50 values of 1.1 and 7.6 mu g/mL to C6 and U138MG gliomas, respectively. Sch-642305 promoted arrest on cell cycle in G2/M inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, this lactone decreased glioma cell migration and modulated redox status, increasing superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and enhancing sulfhydryl content, consequently suppressing reactive species of oxygen generation.

411,Review,"Insect association with fungi has a long history. Theories dealing with the evolution of insect herbivory indicate that insects used microbes including fungi as their principal food materials before flowering plants evolved. Subtlety and the level of intricacy in the interactions between insects and fungi indicate symbiosis as the predominant ecological pattern. The nature of the symbiotic interaction that occurs between two organisms (the insect and the fungus), may be either mutualistic or parasitic, or between these two extremes. However, the triangular relationship involving three organisms, viz., an insect, a fungus, and a vascular plant is a relationship that is more complicated than what can be described as either mutualism or parasitism, and may represent facets of both. Recent research has revealed such a complex relationship in the vertically transmitted type-I endophytes living within agriculturally important grasses and the pestiferous insects that attack them. The intricacy of the association depends on the endophytic fungus-grass association and the insect present. Secondary compounds produced in the endophytic fungus-grass association can provide grasses with resistance to herbivores resulting in mutualistic relationship between the fungus and the plant that has negative consequences for herbivorous insects. The horizontally transmitted nongrass type-II endophytes are far less well studied and as such their ecological roles are not fully understood. This forum article explores the intricacy of dependence in such complex triangular relationships drawing from well-established examples from the fungi that live as endophytes in vascular plants and how they impact on the biology and evolution of free-living as well as concealed (e. g., gall-inducing, gall-inhabiting) insects. Recent developments with the inoculation of strains of type-I fungal endophytes into grasses and their commercialization are discussed, along with the possible roles the endophytic fungi play in the galls induced by the Cecidomyiidae (Diptera).","Raman, A; Wheatley, W; Popay, A",NA,,,"Raman, A.; Wheatley, W.; Popay, A.",NA,Endophytic Fungus-Vascular Plant-Insect Interactions,ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,"Raman, Anantanarayanan/0000-0002-7293-7412; Popay, Alison/0000-0002-0201-5308",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0046-225X,1938-2936,,NA,NA,JUN,2012,41,3,,,NA,433,447,,10.1603/EN11317,http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EN11317,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,22732600,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000305475600004,View Full Record in Web of Science,411,NA

The objective of this work was to evaluate the interaction of the dark septate endophytic fungi with cowpea plants under salt stress. Endophytic fungi were isolated from Vochysia divergens root system, and molecular identification of fungi was performed by sequencing the ITS region. We selected and identified Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and Melanconiella elegans-21W2 for their ability to infect V. divergens root in vitro with development of typical dark septate fungi structures. Cowpea plants-inoculated or not inoculated with Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and M. elegans 21W2-were cultivated in 5-L pots under greenhouse conditions and submitted to four different electrical conductivities of irrigation water (1.2, 2.2, 3.6, and 5.0 dS m(-1)). The salinity caused decrease in leaf concentration of K and increased leaf concentration of calcium, sodium, and chlorine; and no influence of dark septate endophytic fungi was observed in these responses. On the other hand, root colonization with Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and M. elegans 21W2 resulted in improved nutrition with N and P in cowpea under salt stress, favoring the growth and rate of liquid photosynthesis.

Since endophytic fungi possess the natural capacity to produce the similar secondary metabolite to that of their host plants, they are promising as alternative sources of plant bioactive natural products. In this study, in order to search for SSd-producing strains, endophytes were isolated from B. scorzonerifolium and were authenticated by the ITS sequence and the translation elongation factor-1alpha gene (TEF-1 alpha) sequence analysis. The profile of metabolites present in the crude exacts was carried out by ultra performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) analysis. The results showed that two strains, CHS2 and CHS3 from B. scorzonerifolium could produce SSd by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS analysis, and the amount of SSd produced by strain CHS2 and CHS3 were about 2.17 and 2.40 mu g/mL, respectively. CHS2 and CHS3 showed a close phylogenetic relationship to Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium acuminatum, respectively.

414,Presence,"Plants cope with abiotic stress in several ways, including by collaborating with microorganisms. Epichloe, an endophytic fungus, has been shown to improve plant tolerance to extreme external environments. Hordeum bogdanii is a known salt-tolerant plant with the potential to improve alkaline lands. NHX1 plays a key role in the transport of ions in the cell and is overexpressed in plants with increased salt tolerance. However, the expression levels of HbNHX1 in Epichloe endophytic fungal symbionts in H. bogdanii have not been elucidated. We used Hordeum bogdanii (E+) with the endophytic fungi Epichloe bromicola and H. bogdanii (E-) without the endophytic fungi and compared the differences in the ion content and HbNHX1 expression between the shoots and roots of E+ and E- plants under alkaline stress. The absorption capacity of both K+ and Na+ of H. bogdanii with endophytic fungi was higher than that without endophytic fungi. In the absence of alkaline stress, endophytic fungi significantly reduced the Cl- content in the host H. bogdanii. Alkaline stress reduced SO42- content in H. bogdanii; however, compared with E-, endophytic fungi increased the content of SO42- in E+ plants. With an increase in the alkaline concentration, the expression of HbNHX1 in the roots of H. bogdanii with endophytic fungus exhibited an upward trend, whereas the expression in the shoots exhibited a downward trend first and then an upward trend. Under 100 mmol center dot L-1 mixed alkaline stress, the expression of HbNHX1 in E+ was significantly higher than that in E-, indicating that endophytic fungi could increase the Na+ region in vacuoles. The external environment affects the regulation of endophytic fungi in H. bogdanii and that endophytic fungi can play a key role in soil salinization. Therefore, the findings of this study will provide technical support and a theoretical basis for better utilization of endophytic fungi from H. bogdanii in saline land improvement.","Long, F; Hu, MF; Chen, S; Bao, GS; Dan, H; Chen, SH",NA,,,"Long, Feng; Hu, Meng-Fei; Chen, Sheng; Bao, Gen-Sheng; Dan, Han; Chen, Shui-Hong",NA,Endophytic Fungi Regulate HbNHX1 Expression and Ion Balance in Hordeum bogdanii under Alkaline Stress,JOURNAL OF FUNGI,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hu, Mengfei/ABG-3590-2020; Long, Feng/AAN-4694-2021","Hu, Mengfei/0000-0003-4272-144X;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2309-608X,,NA,NA,MAR,2023,9,3,,,NA,,,331,10.3390/jof9030331,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof9030331,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,36983499,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000958230700001,View Full Record in Web of Science,414,NA
415,Presence,"Background: Paclitaxel (Taxol (TM)) is an important anticancer drug with a unique mode of action. The biosynthesis of paclitaxel had been considered restricted to the Taxus species until it was discovered in Taxomyces andreanae, an endophytic fungus of T. brevifolia. Subsequently, paclitaxel was found in hazel (Corylus avellana L.) and in several other endophytic fungi. The distribution of paclitaxel in plants and endophytic fungi and the reported sequence homology of key genes in paclitaxel biosynthesis between plant and fungi species raises the question about whether the origin of this pathway in these two physically associated groups could have been facilitated by horizontal gene transfer. Results: The ability of the endophytic fungus of hazel Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 to independently synthesize paclitaxel was established by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance. The genome of Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 was sequenced and gene candidates that may be involved in paclitaxel biosynthesis were identified by comparison with the 13 known paclitaxel biosynthetic genes in Taxus. We found that paclitaxel biosynthetic gene candidates in P. aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 have evolved independently and that horizontal gene transfer between this endophytic fungus and its plant host is unlikely. Conclusions: Our findings shed new light on how paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungi synthesize paclitaxel, and will facilitate metabolic engineering for the industrial production of paclitaxel from fungi.","Yang, YF; Zhao, HN; Barrero, RA; Zhang, BH; Sun, GL; Wilson, IW; Xie, FL; Walker, KD; Parks, JW; Bruce, R; Guo, GW; Chen, L; Zhang, Y; Huang, X; Tang, Q; Liu, HW; Bellgard, MI; Qiu, DY; Lai, JS; Hoffman, A",NA,,,"Yang, Yanfang; Zhao, Hainan; Barrero, Roberto A.; Zhang, Baohong; Sun, Guiling; Wilson, Iain W.; Xie, Fuliang; Walker, Kevin D.; Parks, Joshua W.; Bruce, Robert; Guo, Guangwu; Chen, Li; Zhang, Yong; Huang, Xin; Tang, Qi; Liu, Hongwei; Bellgard, Matthew I.; Qiu, Deyou; Lai, Jinsheng; Hoffman, Angela",NA,Genome sequencing and analysis of the paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungus Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431,BMC GENOMICS,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wilson, Iain/D-4839-2009; Zhang, Yong/AAS-3454-2020; Zhang, Baohong/O-4948-2016","Wilson, Iain/0000-0002-4626-8059; Bellgard, Matthew/0000-0002-6303-9469; Zhang, Yong/0000-0002-2276-7187; Walker, Kevin/0000-0001-5208-6692; Barrero, Roberto/0000-0002-7735-665X; Tang, Qi/0000-0003-2385-4263",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1471-2164,,,NA,NA,25-Jan,2014,15,,,,NA,,,69,10.1186/1471-2164-15-69,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-15-69,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,24460898,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000332573300001,View Full Record in Web of Science,415,NA

Endophytic fungi were isolated from soybean leaves and initially screened on agar plates for the production of CMCase (carboxymethylcellulase), xylanase, amylase and protease. The highest Enzymatic Indexes (IE) were verified for xylanase (2.14 and 1.31) with the fungi M6-A6P5F2 and M12-A5P3F1.2 and CMCase (1.92 and 1.62) with the fungi M13-A9P2F1 and M12-A5P3F1.2, respectively. The production of xylanase and CMCase by the selected fungi was evaluated in submerged cultivation using beechwood xylan and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), as well as sugarcane straw and bagasse in different ratios as carbon sources. Both types of lignocellulosic biomass proved to be good inducers of enzymatic activity. The best xylanase producer among the isolates was identified as Colletotrichum boninense. With this fungus, the highest xylanase activity was obtained with a sugarcane straw-bagasse mixture in a 50:50 ratio (383.63 U mL(-1)), a result superior to that obtained with the use of beechwood xylan (296.65 U mL(-1)). Regardingthe kinetic behavior of the crude xylanase, there was found optimal pH of 5.0 and optimal temperatures of 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C.

First, high-throughput sequencing technology was applied to explore the community composition and diversity of endophytic fungi in the above-ground tissues (Ea) and below-ground tissues (Eb) of Ephedra sinica. Second, fungi were obtained through culture-dependent technology and used for mini-community remodeling in vitro. Then, the effects of environmental factors, partner fungi, and plant tissue fluid (internal environment) on endophytic fungal community formation were discussed.

480,Presence,"Fungal endophytes of the genus Acremonium infect many grass species. They exist in the intercellular spaces of the aerial plant parts, most abundantly in the leaf sheaths. They therefore must obtain all of their nutrients from the apoplastic spaces in the plant. This report is the first comprehensive, biochemically based study of sugar uptake by Acremonium spp. The endophytes (Acremonium typhinum) were isolated from Festuca rubra plants and were grown in culture. Individual colonies were incubated in the presence of [U-C-14] radiolabeled glucose, fructose, or sucrose for 20 minutes and the uptake quantified by scintillation counting. The uptake rates for all three sugars were biphasic, indicating two distinct mechanisms of transport. At low sugar concentrations (below 10 mM) the uptake was saturable and had the characteristics of a carrier-mediated mechanism. At high sugar concentrations (10-100 mM) the uptake was linear suggesting diffusion as the predominant mechanism of uptake. From competition experiments (uptake of labeled sugar in the presence of a different unlabeled sugar) it appeared that there were separate carriers for glucose and fructose. Two mechanisms for sucrose uptake were detected, a sucrose carrier and hexose uptake as a result of cell wall invertase. Cell wall invertase activity of the fungal isolates was inducible by growing the fungi on sucrose containing media.","LAM, CK; BELANGER, FC; WHITE, JF; DAIE, J",NA,NA,NA,"LAM, CK; BELANGER, FC; WHITE, JF; DAIE, J",NA,"MECHANISM AND RATE OF SUGAR UPTAKE BY ACREMONIUM-TYPHINUM, AN ENDOPHYTIC FUNGUS INFECTING FESTUCA-RUBRA - EVIDENCE FOR PRESENCE OF A CELL-WALL INVERTASE IN ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI",MYCOLOGIA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"White, James/C-2280-2009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0027-5514,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAY-JUN,1994,86,3,NA,NA,NA,408,415,NA,10.2307/3760573,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3760573,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1994NZ04600013,NA,480,NA
481,Presence,"Many plant endophytes produce mycotoxins, but how host genetic variation influences endophyte colonization and mycotoxin production under natural conditions is poorly understood. This interaction has not been fully considered in many previous studies which used controlled experiments with agronomic or model plant species. Here, we investigated this interaction in a naturally occurring forb (a locoweed species) Oxytropis ochrocephala, its symbiotic endophyte Alternaria oxytropis, and the mycotoxin swainsonine. Host genetic variation was characterized by microsatellite markers. Endophyte infection rate and swainsonine levels were determined by PCR and HPLC, respectively. Genetic markers defined two distinct host populations and revealed that host genetics were significantly correlated with geographical location, elevation, and precipitation. As the host diverged, symbiotic interactions were reduced or failed to produce detectable swainsonine in one host population. Host genotype and precipitation had a significant impact in shaping swainsonine production at the population level. This study highlights the effect of host genotype in influencing this interaction in locoweeds.","He, W; Guo, LW; Wang, L; Zhao, QQ; Guo, LZ; Cao, W; Mur, LAJ; Wei, YH",NA,NA,NA,"He, Wei; Guo, Linwei; Wang, Lei; Zhao, Qianqian; Guo, Lizhu; Cao, Wei; Mur, Luis A.

482,Presence,"Microbial plant symbionts are widely spread in nature changing the way their hosts interact with their environment. Neotyphodium fungal endophytes (Clavicipitaceae) are grass symbionts known by their production of alkaloids, toxic for herbivores. Here, we hypothesized that endophytes confer associational protection to non-host plants and change emission of host volatile-compounds. In an outdoor mesocosm experiment, we examined aphid infestation on Trifolium repens plants, in response to Neotyphodium occultans presence in neighbouring Lolium multiflorum. Contrasting levels of Rhizobium were generated in T. repens plants considering that symbiosis with N-2-fixers would influence herbivore abundance. Aphid infestation increased responding to symbiotic status of T. repens plants, when surrounded by non-symbiotic L. multiflorum plants. Endophytes modified the volatile imprints of L. multiflorum plants measured by an electronic nose, suggesting a potential mechanism to benefit neighbours. This associational protection constitutes a new mutualism trait of grass-endophyte symbiosis, becoming a non-private benefit available to other community partners.

483,Presence,"Morphological and physiological responses to water deficit of two tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) cultivars were compared in a glasshouse experiment and the effect, on those responses, of artificial infection of the tall fescue plants with two fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum) strains was evaluated. The cultivars were Maris Kasba (MK), of Mediterranean origin, and El Palenque (EP), an Argentinian cultivar of temperate origin. The endophyte strains AgResearch isolate (AR501) and the Kentucky (KY31) wild type were compared with nil-endophyte controls. Leaf growth rare of EP plants under water deficit was higher and leaf senescence rate lower than for MK plants (P < 0.05). MK plants showed a greater increase in the proportion of dead leaf tissue than EP plants as water deficit increased (P < 0.05). Stomatal conductance and lamina osmotic adjustment at low soil moisture were lower for MK than EP (P < 0.05). Endophyte-infected plants had a lower dry weight and tiller number, but a higher net growth rate during water deficit treatments than endophyte-free plants (P < 0.05). A significant cultivar x endophyte interaction (P < 0.05) was observed for many variables studied. This implies that any new endophyte strain should be evaluated in combination with the plant genotypes with which it is likely to be associated in commercial practice. MK-KY31 and EP-AR501 associations appeared to tolerate short-term water deficit more effectively than other associations studied.

484,Presence,"Most plants obtain nitrogen through nitrogen-fixing bacteria and microbial decomposition of plant and animal material. Many vascular plants are able to form close symbiotic associations with endophytic fungi. Metarhizium is a common plant endophyte found in a large number of ecosystems. This abundant soil fungus is also a pathogen to a large number of insects, which are a source of nitrogen. It is possible that the endophytic capability and insect pathogenicity of Metarhizium are coupled to provide an active method of nitrogen transfer to plant hosts via fungal mycelia. We used soil microcosms to test the ability of M. robertsii to translocate insect-derived nitrogen to plants. Insects were injected with N-15-labeled nitrogen, and we tracked the incorporation of N-15 into amino acids in two plant species, haricot bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), in the presence of M. robertsii. These findings are evidence that active nitrogen acquisition by plants in this tripartite interaction may play a larger role in soil nitrogen cycling than previously thought.","Behie, SW; Zelisko, PM; Bidochka, MJ",NA,NA,NA,"Behie, S.

485,Presence,"Phyllosticta is a cosmopolitan group of fungi found on various host plants, occurring as pathogens, endophytes and saprobes. Diseases caused by Phyllosticta commonly include leaf and fruit spots that can affect economically important plants. The genus is characterized mainly by aseptate and hyaline conidia and ascospores. Its conidia are surrounded by a mucilaginous sheath, with a single mucoid apical appendage while ascospores exhibit a mucoid cap at both ends. Given that many Phyllosticta taxa are cryptic and share similar morphologies, it is arduous to depict taxonomically relevant characters solely on the basis of morphological or ecological features. Coupled with morphological description, multi -locus phylogenetic analyses of species comprising complexes are used to broadly describe this genus and understand species boundaries. Despite several published taxonomic revisions and enumerations of Phyllosticta species, there is still considerable confusion when identifying these taxa. Herein, we establish three new host records for P. capitalensis, and one new geographical record for P. musaechinensis in Thailand, and one new host and geographical record for P. citribrasiliensis in Russia. We provide an updated phylogenetic tree based on several gene markers: ITS, LSU, ACT, GAPDH, RPB2, and TEF-1 alpha. This includes all Phyllosticta species for which sequence data is available.

Microbial symbionts are proposed to have profound effects on fitness of their host plants and vice versa, especially when their fitness is tightly linked. Here we studied local adaptation of host plants and possible fitness contribution of such symbiosis in the context of abiotic environmental factors. We conducted a four-way multi-year reciprocal transplant experiment with natural populations of the perennial grass Festuca rubra s.l. from northern and southern Finland, Faroe Islands and Spain. We included F. rubra with and without transmitted symbiotic fungus Epichloe that is vertically transmitted via host seed. We found local adaptation across the European range, as evidenced by higher host fitness of the local geographic origin compared with nonlocals at three of the four studied sites, suggesting that selection pressures are driving evolution in different directions. Abiotic factors did not result in strong fitness effects related to Epichloe symbiosis, indicating that other factors such as herbivory are more likely to contribute to fitness differences between plants naturally occurring with or without Epichloe. Nevertheless, in the case of asymmetric symbiosis that is obligatory for the symbiont, abiotic conditions that affect performance of the host, may also cause selective pressure for the symbiont.","Leinonen, PH; Helander, M; Vazquez-de-Aldana, BR; Zabalgogeazcoa, I; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Leinonen, Paivi; Helander, Marjo; Vazquez-de-Aldana, Beatriz; Zabalgogeazcoa, Inigo; Saikkonen, Kari",NA,Local adaptation in natural European host grass populations with asymmetric symbiosis,PLOS ONE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zabalgogeazcoa, Inigo/F-9523-2016; Leinonen, Paivi/IWV-0880-2023; Vazquez-de-Aldana, Beatriz/A-7760-2008","Zabalgogeazcoa, Inigo/0000-0002-9524-7799; Leinonen, Paivi/0000-0003-0210-5589; Vazquez-de-Aldana, Beatriz/0000-0001-6549-3545; Saikkonen, Kari/0000-0001-5203-9984",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1932-6203,NA,NA,NA,NA,17-Apr,2019,14,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0215510,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215510,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30995278,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000465010000058,NA,486,NA

We posited that the abiotic factors shaping tree diversity extend to hyperdiverse symbionts in leaves-fungal endophytes-that influence plant health, function, and resilience to stress. Through surveys in forests across Panama that considered climate, seasonality, and covarying biotic factors, we demonstrate that endophyte richness varies negatively with temperature seasonality. Endophyte community structure and taxonomic composition reflect both temperature seasonality and climate (mean annual temperature and precipitation). Overall our findings highlight the vital role of climate-related factors in shaping the hyperdiversity of these important and little-known symbionts of the trees that, in turn, form the foundations of tropical forest biodiversity.","Oita, S; Ibáñez, A; Lutzoni, F; Miadlikowska, J; Geml, J; Lewis, LA; Hom, EFY; Carbone, I; U'Ren, JM; Arnold, AE",NA,NA,NA,"Oita, Shuzo; Ibanez, Alicia; Lutzoni, Francois; Miadlikowska, Jolanta; Geml, Jozsef; Lewis, Louise A.; Hom, Erik F.

491,Both,"Cool-season grasses establish symbioses with vertically transmitted Neotyphodium endophytes widespread in nature. The frequency of endophyte-infected plants in closed populations (i.e., without migrations) depends on both the differential fitness between infected and non-infected plants, and the endophyte-transmission efficiency. Most studies have been focused on the first mechanism ignoring the second. Infection frequency and endophyte transmission from vegetative tissues to seeds were surveyed in two grasses growing in vegetation units that differ in flood and grazing regimes, and soil salinity. Transmission efficiency and infection frequency for tall fescue did not vary significantly and were 0.98 and 1.00, respectively. For Italian ryegrass, transmission efficiency and infection frequency were 0.88 and 0.57 in humid prairies, and 0.96 and 0.96 in the other vegetation units. Only in humid mesophytic meadows, the observed pattern was irrespective of the presence or absence of grazers. Our results suggest that selection forces for endophyte infection are different for both species. Imperfect transmission was only compensated in tall fescue through an increased fitness of infected plants. Interpreting variations of infection frequency only in terms of differential fitness can be misleading, considering that endophyte transmission can be imperfect and variable in nature. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of measuring transmission efficiency.","Gundel, PE; Garibaldi, LA; Tognetti, PM; Aragón, R; Ghersa, CM; Omacini, M",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro E.; Garibaldi, Lucas A.; Tognetti, Pedro M.; Aragon, Roxana; Ghersa, Claudio M.; Omacini, Marina",NA,Imperfect Vertical Transmission of the Endophyte <i>Neotyphodium</i> in Exotic Grasses in Grasslands of the Flooding Pampa,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tognetti, Pedro/AAF-7018-2019; Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Garibaldi, Lucas/D-7302-2013","Garibaldi, Lucas Alejandro/0000-0003-0725-4049; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Tognetti, Pedro M./0000-0001-7358-1334; Omacini, Marina/0000-0003-1460-262X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0095-3628,1432-184X,NA,NA,NA,MAY,2009,57,4,NA,NA,NA,740,748,NA,10.1007/s00248-008-9447-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-008-9447-y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18797956,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000265044900015,NA,491,NA

493,Both,"Pooideae grasses may be colonized by systemic fungal endophytes. The fitness of endophyte depends entirely on resources and seed transmission from the host plant, while colonized plants may gain increased survival, growth, and reproduction relative to their uncolonized conspecifics. Most research of endophyte-grass interactions have been carried out on few cultivars of tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix) and their symbiont Neotyphodium coenophialum. Lack of studies using wild populations of tall fescue across the species natural distribution range, however, limits the understanding of the ecological and evolutionary role of the symbiosis in nature. We performed a common garden experiment in Southern Finland with three wild, tall fescue populations from northern Europe and the forage cultivar Kentucky-31 (KY-31). For each population, we used naturally endophyte-colonized, naturally endophyte-colonized but endophyte removed (decolonized), and naturally uncolonized plants to separate effects due to the host genotype from the endophyte. We evaluated growth variables and survival in four environmental treatments of varying water and nutrients. Supply of water and nutrients increased plant biomass and reproductive effort in all populations. This effect was higher for KY-31 plants which produced on average 55 % more seeds than wild plants, indicating better adaptation to high resource environments. However, the higher incidence of Claviceps sp. and the low winter survival indicated KY-31 tall fescue is mal-adapted to Northern European conditions. Naturally colonized plants had greater plant biomass (a parts per thousand 12 %), reproductive effort (a parts per thousand 22 %) and seed mass (a parts per thousand 29 %) than naturally uncolonized and decolonized plants. Nonetheless, endophyte colonization did not affect plant survival, and the effects of endophyte colonization on tiller number, panicle/tiller ratio and Claviceps sp. incidence depended on the population origin. In the wild populations, endophyte removal only reduced the number of tillers (a parts per thousand 29 % lower), while the difference between naturally colonized and naturally uncolonized plants was not significant. Our results show that endophyte symbiont increases tall fescue performance in general, but the differences between wild populations and cultivars indicate adaptation to local habitats and agronomic management, respectively. The comparison of naturally endophyte-colonized and decolonized plants suggests certain plant genotype-endophyte combinations found within populations result from local selection pressures.","Gundel, PE; Helander, M; Casas, C; Hamilton, CE; Faeth, SH; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro E.; Helander, Marjo; Casas, Cecilia; Hamilton, Cyd E.; Faeth, Stanley H.; Saikkonen, Kari",NA,<i>Neotyphodium</i> fungal endophyte in tall fescue (<i>Schedonorus phoenix</i>): a comparison of three Northern European wild populations and the cultivar Kentuky-31,FUNGAL DIVERSITY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013","Casas, Cecilia/0000-0003-3538-6081; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Hamilton, Cyd/0000-0002-6378-3407; Saikkonen, Kari/0000-0001-5203-9984; Helander, Marjo/0000-0002-9759-4321",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1560-2745,1878-9129,NA,NA,NA,MAY,2013,60,1,NA,SI,NA,15,24,NA,10.1007/s13225-012-0173-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13225-012-0173-x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000320112900003,NA,493,NA

The major life-history traits and aspects of the epidemiology (isolation, survival, reproduction, dispersal, host selectivity) and control of the oak anthracnose agent are elucidated. The role of weather patterns in disrupting the delicate interaction between the host tree and the microorganism is outlined. The evidence suggests that changes in the climate profoundly alter the plant-endophyte symbiosis, generating conflicts of interest between the partners in the interaction. When such competing interests arise, the survival and reproduction of one member of the interaction do not conform with that of the partner. The interaction becomes thus disadvantageous and harmful to one of the organisms and the symbiosis from mutualistic or neutral turns antagonistic. The fungal partner, which under normal conditions survives in quiescence, with a low biomass, resumes growth but now switches from a latent, asymptomatic occupier of inner oak tissues to an aggressive coloniser that sporulates profusely over the tree surface. The importance of investigating the functioning and the role of the plant-endophyte symbiosis in perennial host trees in natural forests is stressed.","Moricca, S; Ragazzi, A",NA,"Pirttila, AM; Frank, AC",NA,"Moricca, Salvatore; Ragazzi, Alessandro",NA,The Holomorph <i>Apiognomonia quercina</i>/<i>Discula quercina</i> as a Pathogen/Endophyte in Oak,ENDOPHYTES OF FOREST TREE: BIOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS,Forestry Sciences,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0924-5480,1875-1334,978-94-007-1598-1,NA,NA,NA,2011,80,NA,NA,NA,NA,47,66,NA,10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8_3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8_3,10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000294391600003,NA,494,NA

The basic development and structure of ericoid mycorrhizal infections in epacrids is similar to other Ericaceae. However, data are limited on the structure and physiology of both hair roots and ericoid mycorrhizas for all Ericaceae. Relatively little is known about the functional significance of ericoid mycorrhizas in epacrids in southern hemisphere habitats that are often poor in organic matter accumulation. However the abilities of fungal endophytes of epacrids to utilize organic N and P substrates equal those of endophytes from northern hemisphere heathland plant hosts.

501,Presence,"In ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, iron-responsive GATA-type transcriptional repressors are involved in regulating iron homeostasis, notably to prevent iron toxicity through control of iron uptake. To date, it has been unknown whether this iron regulator contributes toward mutualistic endosymbiosis of microbes with plants, a system where the endophyte must function within the constraints of an in-host existence, including a dependency on the host for nutrient acquisition. Functional characterization of one such protein, SreA from Epichloe festucae, a fungal endosymbiont of cool-season grasses, indicates that regulation of iron homeostasis processes is important for symbiotic maintenance. The deletion of the sreA gene (Delta sreA) led to iron-dependent aberrant hyphal growth and the gradual loss of endophyte hyphae from perennial ryegrass. SreA negatively regulates the siderophore biosynthesis and high-affinity iron uptake systems of E. festucae, similar to other fungi, resulting in iron accumulation in mutants. Our evidence suggests that SreA is involved in the processes that moderate Epichloe iron acquisition from the plant apoplast, because overharvesting of iron in Delta sreA mutants was detected as premature chlorosis of the host using a hydroponic plant growth assay. E. festucae appears to have a tightly regulated iron management system, involving SreA that balances endophyte growth with its survival and prevents overcompetition with the host for iron in the intercellular niche, thus promoting mutualistic associations. Mutations that interfere with Epichloe iron management negatively affect iron-dependent fungal growth and destabilize mutualistic Epichloe -ryegrass associations.","Forester, NT; Lane, GA; McKenzie, CM; Lamont, IL; Johnson, LJ",NA,NA,NA,"Forester, Natasha T.; Lane, Geoffrey A.; McKenzie, Catherine M.; Lamont, Iain L.; Johnson, Linda J.",NA,The Role of SreA-Mediated Iron Regulation in Maintaining Epichloe <i>festucae-Lolium</i> <i>perenne</i> Symbioses,MOLECULAR PLANT-MICROBE INTERACTIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"McKenzie, Catherine/O-6723-2018","McKenzie, Catherine/0000-0002-3075-954X; Forester, Natasha Talei/0000-0002-9329-1710",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0894-0282,1943-7706,NA,NA,NA,OCT,2019,32,10,NA,NA,NA,1324,1335,NA,10.1094/MPMI-03-19-0060-R,http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-03-19-0060-R,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31107632,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000488776300009,NA,501,NA
502,Presence,"Observations at three grassland sites in England and Wales on nine perennial ryegrass genotypes infected or not by the endophytic fungus Acremonium lolii, showed that populations of plant-parasitic nematodes were not reduced on endophyte-infected plants during the two years of the experiment. There was evidence at two sites, where numbers of plant nematodes increased during the trial period, that there were significantly more nematodes on endophyte-infected plants. At the third site, where nematode populations did not increase, there was no difference between endophyte treatments. Nematode population changes on one genotype, known to grow better when endophyte-infected, were similar to the average for all genotypes. In a glasshouse pot experiment, invasion and development of root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne naasi, was the same on endophyte-infected and endophyte-free plants of the responsive genotype. In samples from field plots and in the pot experiment, roots of endophyte-infected plants were larger and probably accounted for the increased nematode populations.","COOK, R; LEWIS, GC; MIZEN, KA",NA,NA,NA,"COOK, R; LEWIS, GC; MIZEN, KA",NA,"EFFECTS ON PLANT-PARASITIC NEMATODES OF INFECTION OF PERENNIAL RYEGRASS, LOLIUM-PERENNE, BY THE ENDOPHYTIC FUNGUS, ACREMONIUM-LOLII",CROP PROTECTION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0261-2194,NA,NA,NA,NA,OCT,1991,10,5,NA,NA,NA,403,407,NA,10.1016/S0261-2194(06)80032-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0261-2194(06)80032-3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1991GH97700013,NA,502,NA
503,Presence,"Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is a C-3 perennial grass noted for its persistence in harsh environments. Tall fescue persistence is enhanced by Acremonium coenophialum, a mutualistic fungal endophyte that increases resistance to drought, pathogens, and insects. This research was conducted to identify and elicit biochemical mechanism(s) that could account for tall fescue persistence. In initial studies, two cultivars known to differ in persistence were analyzed for chitinase, an antifungal hydrolase associated with disease resistance in other plants. Acremonium-infected Kentucky 31 (KY31), a persistent cultivar, and Johnstone, a nonpersistent cultivar, were inoculated with the parasitic nematode, Meloidogyne marylandi, grown for 50 days, and analyzed at 10-day intervals. Chitinase fluctuated throughout the 50-day period of seedling development, and activity was highest in the persistent Acremonium-infected KY31. In addition, chitinase was elicited by parasitic M. marylandi and expressed systemically. Subsequent studies were conducted to determine whether or not mutualistic Acremonium could increase chitinase activity. Genetically identical KY31, with and without Acremonium, were grown for 25 days and analyzed for chitinase at 5-day intervals. After 20 days, Acremonium-infected KY31 expressed more chitinase than Acremonium-free KY31. We concluded that chitinase is related to tall fescue persistence; it was highest in the most persistent cultivar, increased under pathogen attack, and increased in the presence of Acremonium, a symbiont known to enhance disease resistance.","ROBERTS, CA; MAREK, SM; NIBLACK, TL; KARR, AL",NA,NA,NA,"ROBERTS, CA; MAREK, SM; NIBLACK, TL; KARR, AL",NA,PARASITIC MELOIDOGYNE AND MUTUALISTIC ACREMONIUM INCREASE CHITINASE IN TALL FESCUE,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Marek, Stephen/Q-6911-2019; Marek, Stephen/M-9865-2013","Marek, Stephen/0000-0002-0146-8049",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0098-0331,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUL,1992,18,7,NA,NA,NA,1107,1116,NA,10.1007/BF00980066,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00980066,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24254151,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1992JD59000013,NA,503,NA
504,Presence,"Tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) infected by Epichloe coenophiala contains ergot alkaloids responsible for fescue toxicosis in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, with only a few cases occurring in Europe. The detection of Epichloe in 166 L. arundinaceum collected in southern France revealed that 60% were infected, 51% being high ergovaline producers. The ergovaline level in endophyte-infected tall fescue Kentucky 31 was monitored during 3 years in various parts of the plant. Maturation of plants, recorded according to the BBCH scale, appeared to be the main factor for estimating the risk of toxicity. Ergovaline levels of =300 mu g/kg dry matter were obtained at the end of spring, the beginning of autumn, and mid-winter. Positive correlation between ergovaline level and cumulative degree-d was observed, whereas rainfall had no effect. These results suggest that the lack of fescue toxicosis observed in France cannot be explained by the lack of ergovaline in tall fescue.","Repussard, C; Zbib, N; Tardieu, D; Guerre, P",NA,NA,NA,"Repussard, Celine; Zbib, Nasrallah; Tardieu, Didier; Guerre, Philippe",NA,Endophyte Infection of Tall Fescue and the Impact of Climatic Factors on Ergovaline Concentrations in Field Crops Cultivated in Southern France,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"GUERRE, Philippe/ABA-8286-2020","GUERRE, Philippe/0000-0002-9777-3784",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0021-8561,1520-5118,NA,NA,NA,1-Oct,2014,62,39,NA,NA,NA,9609,9614,NA,10.1021/jf503015m,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf503015m,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25192465,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000342609500028,NA,504,NA
505,Presence,"The identification of fungal endophytes often relies on culturing isolates from surface-sterilized plant tissue. However, molecular techniques have enabled the rapid detection and identifi cation of targeted endophyte species, and next-generation sequencing technology provides an opportunity to obtain comprehensive information on endophytic communities, directly from plant tissue. In order to achieve accurate detection from internal tissues, surface microbes and associated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) must be eliminated, with particular consideration for the type of plant tissue and the efficacy of the surface sterilization procedure used. The methodology described later was developed specifically for detection of DNA from the entomopathogenic fungal endophyte Beauveria bassiana (Vuillemin) (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) in various tissues of Zea mays (L.). However, the protocol may be easily applied to other fungi and bacterial endophytes. Included is a stringent sodium hypochlorite-based surface sterilization protocol for plant material in preparation for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect target DNA within plant tissue. Included are a treatment for dealing with surface DNA contamination and a novel procedure for assessing the efficacy of surface sterilization using PCR.","McKinnon, AC",NA,"Glare, TR; MoranDiez, ME",NA,"McKinnon, Aimee C.",NA,Plant Tissue Preparation for the Detection of an Endophytic Fungus <i>In Planta</i>,MICROBIAL-BASED BIOPESTICIDES: METHODS AND PROTOCOLS,Methods in Molecular Biology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1064-3745,NA,978-1-4939-6367-6; 978-1-4939-6365-2,NA,NA,NA,2016,1477,NA,NA,NA,NA,167,173,NA,10.1007/978-1-4939-6367-6_13,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-6367-6_13,10.1007/978-1-4939-6367-6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27565499,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000399773100014,NA,505,NA
506,Presence,"The molecular analysis of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis started at the beginning of this decade. The paper summarises the work of the ‘Laboratorium für Molekulare Genetik arbuskulärer Mykorrhiza’ at the MPI für terrestrische Mikrobiologie in Marburg on three major topics. Firstly, the plant response to the mycorrhizal colonisation was analysed using both, targeted and non-targeted approaches. As an example, the localisation of the gst1 mRNA in potato mycorrhiza is shown. Second, molecular techniques were established to analyse gene expression of the fungal partner of the symbiosis. We present a differential RNA display analysis of spore germination in two AM fungi and the cloning of a gene from Glomus mosseae that shows expression at all stages of the fungal life cycle. In the last part, we introduce the work we are carrying out with a new root endophytic fungus, Piriformospora indica. Infection experiments on maize showed that despite the fungus performs as a root necrotroph, it has a positive effect on plant growth. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Franken P.; Requena N.; Bütehorn B.; Krajinski F.; Kuhn G.; Lapopin L.; Mann P.; Rhody D.; Stommel M.,NA,,NA,"Franken, Philipp (7102792218); Requena, Natalia (6603854531); Bütehorn, Britta (7801343267); Krajinski, Franziska (6603375678); Kuhn, Gerrit (58320871300); Lapopin, Laurence (6507415680); Mann, Petra (57191162109); Rhody, Daniela (6507232197); Stommel, Michaela (7003796074)",NA,Molecular analysis of the Arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis,Archives of Agronomy and Soil Science,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,,,,NA,Arbuscular mycorrhiza; Differential gene expression; Piriformospora indica,,"Franken P., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Requena N., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Bütehorn B., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Krajinski F., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Kuhn G., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Lapopin L., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Mann P., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Rhody D., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Stommel M., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany","Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany","P.

507,Both,"Fitness in tall fescue could be determined as the relative seed production by overcoming self-incompatibility barriers. This study was an attempt to investigate the effects of plant genotype and symbiotic fungal endophyte on seed production and associated traits in tall fescue. Fifteen clones of tall fescue free from endophyte and two clones with both endophyte-infected (E+) and non-infected (E-) counterparts were evaluated under two pollination systems of natural open-pollination and obligate self-pollination. Although seed yield was depressed by self-pollination in all E- genotypes, some genotypes exhibited reasonable selfing ratio. However, endophyte infection was much more effective to increase selfing ratio and seed yield through self-pollination particularly in the genotype 75B. Endophyte infection almost removed self-incompatibilty in the host plants and on average resulted in 3.0 times more number of seeds per self-pollinated seedheads than the non-counterpart E- tall fescue genotypes. Although it may need more elaborated studies, incorporating Epichloe fungal endophyte in plant genotypes not only may make the inbreeding in tall fescue possible but also may improve forage yield and seed production, simultaneously.","Zarean, M; Sabzalian, MR; Mirlohi, A; Davoudi, M; Ataii, E",NA,NA,NA,"Zarean, M.; Sabzalian, Mohammad R.; Mirlohi, A.; Davoudi, M.; Ataii, E.",NA,<i>Epichloe</i> endophyte and plant genotype determine seed production through self-pollination in tall fescue,EUPHYTICA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sabzalian, Mohammad R./E-6279-2013","Sabzalian, Mohammad R./0000-0002-7315-9990",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0014-2336,1573-5060,NA,NA,NA,NOV,2017,213,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1007/s10681-017-2037-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-017-2037-7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000413697900012,NA,507,NA

509,Presence,"In a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial experiment, plants of one genotype of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) were grown in soil in pots in a glasshouse on two occasions. The treatments were either with (E+) or without (E-) infection by the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum; with (N+) or without (N-) inoculation by the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne marylandi; and with or without water deficit stress. In the first experiment, nematode numbers after 5 weeks had increased 10 times in the E-/N- watered pots and 22 times in the E-/N+ stressed plants. Root dry weight was decreased in all E-/N+ pots, compared with E-/N-. In contrast, nematode numbers in all E+/N+ pots decreased to nearly zero and root dry weight was unaffected. Osmotic adjustment in the growing zone of stressed plants was -0.35 MPa in E-/N- pots, but only -0.10 MPa in E-/N+ pots. Osmotic adjustment was greatest (-0.64 MPa) in E+ pots of both nematode treatments and almost no nematodes survived in the N+ pots. In the second experiment, there was complete nematode mortality in the E+ pots. Plant water relations were unaffected by treatments, however. It is concluded that endophyte-enhanced persistence of tall rescue in M. marylandi-infested soils that are prone to drought may be explained at least partly by endophyte protection of roots from nematode damage.

513,Both,"An experiment was designed to determine the effect of the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium lolii on the growth, physiological parameters and mineral element content of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perennel L.), when growing at two N supply levels. Endophyte infection had a significant positive effect on both shoot and root growth of ryegrass, but this difference was only significant in the high N supply treatment. At high N supply, endophyte-infected (EI) plants accumulated more soluble sugar in the sheath and the root than endophyte-free (EF) plants. Endophyte infection affected mineral element concentrations in the root more than in the shoot. We found a significant effect of endophyte infection on B, Mn and Mg in the root, but significant effect was only found on B in the shoot.

516,Presence,"Larch sawfly, Pristiphora erichsonii Hartig, and larch needlecast fungus, Mycosphaerella laricinia (R. Hartig) Neg., are early season defoliators restricted only to Larix host trees. Larch defoliation (100%) by either the fungus or insect, but not mechanical removal, induced systemic responses that reduced sawfly consumption and digestion rates one year later. In a feeding behavior assay, larvae quickly abandoned seedlings previously defoliated by M. laricinia. Adult female oviposition choice and egg deposition were unaffected. Seedling growth was not affected during the year of defoliation by M. laricinia, but was significantly reduced one year later. Defoliation by M. laricinia reduced stem volume, radial growth, root biomass and new shoot production. The latter tissue is the only oviposition resource for larch sawfly, and, in contrast, is not influenced by sawfly feeding. We hypothesize that M. laricinia infection may limit larch sawfly populations where both species coexist. However, this reduction is at a substantial net cost to larch productivity.","KRAUSE, SC; RAFFA, KF",NA,NA,NA,"KRAUSE, SC; RAFFA, KF",NA,"COMPARISON OF INSECT, FUNGAL, AND MECHANICALLY INDUCED DEFOLIATION OF LARCH - EFFECTS ON PLANT PRODUCTIVITY AND SUBSEQUENT HOST SUSCEPTIBILITY",OECOLOGIA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0029-8549,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUN,1992,90,3,NA,NA,NA,411,416,NA,10.1007/BF00317699,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00317699,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28313529,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1992HW29400014,NA,516,NA
517,Both,"Tropospheric ozone is among the global change factors that pose a threat to plants and microorganisms. Symbiotic microorganisms can assist plants to cope with stress, but their role in the tolerance of plants to ozone is poorly understood. Here, we subjected endophyte-symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants of Lolium multiflorum, an annual species widely distributed in temperate grasslands, to high and low (i.e., charcoal-filtered air) ozone levels at vegetative and reproductive phases. Exposure to high ozone reduced leaf photochemical efficiency and greenness in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants. However, ozone-induced oxidative damage at biochemical level (i.e., lipid peroxidation) was mostly detected in symbiotic plants. Ozone exposure at the vegetative phase did not affect the reproductive investment in seeds, indicating full recovery from stress. Ozone exposure at the reproductive phase reduced biomass and seed production only in symbiotic plants indicating a symbiontassociated cost. At low ozone, endophyte-symbiotic plants showed a steeper slope in the relationship between seed number and seed weight (i.e., a number-weight trade-off) compared to non-symbiotic plants. However, when plants were treated at the reproductive phase, ozone increased the imbalance between seed number and seed weight in both endophyte-symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants. Plants with endophytes at the reproductive stage produced fewer seeds, which were not compensated by increased seed weight. Thus, fungal mycelium growing within ovaries or ozone-induced antioxidant systems may result in costs that finally depress the fitness of plants. Despite ozone pollution could destabilize plant-endophyte mutualisms and render them dysfunctional, other endophyte-mediated benefits (e.g., resistance to herbivory, tolerance to drought) could over-compensate these losses and explain the high incidence of the symbiosis in nature.","Ueno, AC; Gundel, PE; Ghersa, CM; Agathokleous, E; Martínez-Ghersa, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Ueno, Andrea C.; Gundel, Pedro E.; Ghersa, Claudio M.; Agathokleous, Evgenios; Alejandra Martinez-Ghersa, M.",NA,Seed-borne fungal endophytes constrain reproductive success of host plants under ozone pollution,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Agathokleous, Evgenios/D-2838-2016","Agathokleous, Evgenios/0000-0002-0058-4857",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0013-9351,1096-0953,NA,NA,NA,NOV,2021,202,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1016/j.envres.2021.111773,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111773,NA,21-Jul,NA,NA,NA,NA,34324850,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000703536100002,NA,517,NA
518,Both,"Plants have evolved mechanisms to survive herbivory. One such mechanism is the induction of defences upon attack that can operate intergenerationally. Cool-season grasses (sub-family Pooideae) obtain defences via symbiosis with vertically transmitted fungal endophytes (genus Epichloe) and can also show inducible responses. However, it is unknown whether these herbivore-induced responses can have intergenerational effects. We hypothesized that herbivory by aphids on maternal plants induces the intergenerational accumulation of endophyte-derived defensive alkaloids and resistance intensification in the progeny. We subjected mother plants symbiotic or not with Epichloe occultans, a species known for its production of anti-insect alkaloids known as lolines, to the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi. Then, we evaluated the progeny of these plants in terms of loline alkaloid concentration, resistance level (through herbivore performance), and shoot biomass. Herbivory on mother plants did not increase the concentration of lolines in seeds but it tended to affect loline concentration in progeny plants. There was an overall herbivore-induced intergenerational effect increasing the endophyte-conferred defence and resistance. Symbiotic plants were more resistant to aphids and had higher shoot biomass than their non-symbiotic counterparts. Since maternal herbivory did not affect the loline concentrations in seeds, the greater resistance of the progeny could have resulted from an inherited mechanism of epigenetic regulation. It would be interesting to elucidate the origin of this regulation since it could come from the host or the fungal symbiont. Thus, endophyte-driven differential fitness between symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants might be higher as generations pass on in presence of herbivores.","Bustos, LBM; Ueno, AC; Biganzoli, F; Card, SD; Mace, WJ; Martínez-Ghersa, MA; Gundel, PE",NA,NA,NA,"Bubica Bustos, Ludmila M.; Ueno, Andrea C.; Biganzoli, Fernando; Card, Stuart D.; Mace, Wade J.; Martinez-Ghersa, Maria A.; Gundel, Pedro E.",NA,Can Aphid Herbivory Induce Intergenerational Effects of Endophyte-conferred Resistance in Grasses?,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013","Card, Stuart/0000-0001-7140-7471; Biganzoli, Fernando/0000-0003-0004-5295; Ueno, Andrea/0000-0002-7853-5270",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0098-0331,1573-1561,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2022,48,12-Nov,NA,NA,NA,867,881,NA,10.1007/s10886-022-01390-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-022-01390-2,NA,22-Nov,NA,NA,NA,NA,36372818,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000882843500001,NA,518,NA

These endophytes produce the toxin swainsonine, which causes a neurological syndrome (locosim) when the plant is ingested by grazing animals. Here we characterize the growth of the endophytes within plant tissues using confocal and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to define the physical relationship. Microscopy results revealed the endophyte distribution to be densely networked, with the mycelia aligned parallel to the long axis of the plant stem and with no pathology to plant cell walls, xylem, or phloem. The autofluorescent mycelia were located intercellulary in the pith of stems. Stereofluoroscope observations of Alternaria oxytropis, A. cinerea, and A. fulva in phytoagar showed that mycelial growth occurred at the tip of hyphae. The growth rate of A. cinerea was significantly faster than for A. oxytropis or A. fulva. All three species of endophytes grew significantly faster at 3 days age of culture and grew slowly or not at all after 20 or 30 days.

How different endophyte strains impact biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in mixed species pastures is unknown. We asked whether novel endophyte or common toxic endophyte-infected (NE+; CTE+) tall fescue affects symbiotic and non-symbiotic BNF, and utilization of biologically-fixed nitrogen in tall fescue. Tall fescue was planted either endophyte-free (E-), infected with CTE, two non-toxic strains AR542 NE, AR584 NE, or a blend of endophyte treatments. We measured natural abundance of (15) N in plant and soil samples, and conducted soil acetylene reduction assays. Endophyte presence and strain significantly affected the delta N-15 of tall fescue. Near red clover, CTE+ and AR584 NE+ tall fescue were most (15) N-depleted; but away, E- tall fescue was most (15) N-depleted. Endophyte strain significantly influenced N concentration in red clover, but not symbiotic or non-symbiotic BNF. Endophyte strains produce different effects on tall fescue's competitive ability and nitrogen utilization.

522,Presence,"In the Pacific Northwest, AInus rubra Bong. (red alder) is a common deciduous tree species especially prevalent in riparian corridors and disturbed sites, including metropolitan areas undergoing land use changes and development. Importantly, red alder is also considered a bioindicator for ozone pollution and, like all plants, harbors a diverse endophyte community that may interact with aerial pollutants. In this study, we surveyed foliar fungal endophyte communities (microfungi) in red alder leaves from the metropolitan area of Portland, Oregon, USA, using culture-based techniques, and found that communities differed significantly by site. Our results suggest that the fungal endophyte community composition in red alder leaves may be influenced in part by local air pollution sources, likely in conjunction with other site characteristics. As urban areas expand, more studies should focus on how the urban environment affects plant-microbe community ecology and endophyte-host interactions, as well as on the long-term consequences for other ecosystem processes such as leaf litter decomposition.","Wolfe, ER; Kautz, S; Singleton, SL; Ballhorn, DJ",NA,NA,NA,"Wolfe, Emily R.; Kautz, Stefanie; Singleton, Sebastian L.; Ballhorn, Daniel J.",NA,Differences in foliar endophyte communities of red alder (<i>Alnus rubra</i>) exposed to varying air pollutant levels,BOTANY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wolfe, Emily/0000-0003-1808-7012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1916-2790,1916-2804,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2018,96,12,NA,NA,NA,825,835,NA,10.1139/cjb-2018-0085,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2018-0085,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000451221000002,NA,522,NA

524,Presence,"The true myrtle, Myrtus communis, is a small perennial evergreen tree that occurs in Europe, Africa, and Asia with a circum-Mediterranean geographic distribution. Unfortunately, the Mediterranean Forests, where M. communis occurs, are critically endangered and are currently restricted to small fragmented areas in protected conservation units. In the present work, we performed, for the first time, a metabarcoding study on the spatial variation of fungal community structure in the foliar endophytome of this endemic plant of the Mediterranean biome, using bipartite network analysis as a model. The local bipartite network of Myrtus communis individuals and their foliar endophytic fungi is very low connected, with low nestedness, and moderately high specialization and modularity. Similar network patterns were also retrieved in both culture-dependent and amplicon metagenomics of foliar endophytes in distinct arboreal hosts in varied biomes. Furthermore, the majority of putative fungal endophytes species were basidiomycete woody saprotrophs of the orders Polyporales, Agaricales, and Hymenochaetales. Altogether, these findings suggest a possible adaptation of these wood-decaying fungi to cope with moisture limitation and spatial scarcity of their primary substrate (dead wood), which are totally consistent with the predictions of the viaphytism hypothesis that wood-decomposing fungi inhabit the internal leaf tissue of forest trees in order to enhance dispersal to substrates on the forest floor, by using leaves as vectors and as refugia, during periods of environmental stress.","Vaz, ABM; Fonseca, PLC; Silva, FF; Quintanilha-Peixoto, G; Sampedro, I; Siles, JA; Carmo, A; Kato, RB; Azevedo, V; Badotti, F; Ocampo, JA; Rosa, CA; Góes-Neto, A",NA,NA,NA,"Vaz, Aline Bruna M.; Fonseca, Paula Luize C.; Silva, Felipe F.; Quintanilha-Peixoto, Gabriel; Sampedro, Inmaculada; Siles, Jose A.; Carmo, Anderson; Kato, Rodrigo B.; Azevedo, Vasco; Badotti, Fernanda; Ocampo, Juan A.; Rosa, Carlos A.; Goes-Neto, Aristoteles",NA,Foliar mycoendophytome of an endemic plant of the Mediterranean biome <i>(Myrtus communis</i>) reveals the dominance of basidiomycete woody saprotrophs,PEERJ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ocampo, Juan/K-7565-2014; Vaz, Aline/F-7684-2012; Carmo, Anderson/E-6427-2016; Goes-Neto, Aristoteles/A-6955-2013; Fonseca, Paula/AAL-8690-2020; Azevedo, Vasco/B-1556-2019; vasco, azevedo/F-4315-2011; Badotti, Fernanda/G-8556-2017; Kato, Rodrigo/Q-2242-2017; Siles, Jose A./A-7043-2019","Oliveira do Carmo, Anderson/0000-0003-4646-513X; Rosa, Carlos/0000-0002-0056-9075; Quintanilha-Peixoto, Gabriel/0000-0002-7476-5845; vasco, azevedo/0000-0002-4775-2280; Badotti, Fernanda/0000-0001-9038-4631; Kato, Rodrigo/0000-0002-9046-1702; Vaz, Aline/0000-0002-3167-6308; Fonseca, Paula/0000-0002-8103-9235; Siles, Jose A./0000-0002-5850-0281",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2167-8359,NA,NA,NA,NA,3-Dec,2020,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.7717/peerj.10487,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10487,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33344092,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000595237000007,NA,524,NA

Fungal plant diseases are of major phytopathological concern; thus, the development of metabarcoding approaches for the detection of phytopathogenic fungi is becoming increasingly imperative in the context of plant disease prognosis. We developed a multiplex metabarcoding method for the identification of fungal phytopathogens and endophytes in olive young shoots, using the MinION sequencing platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Selected fungal-specific primers were used to amplify three different genomic DNA loci (ITS, beta-tubulin, and 28S LSU) originating from olive twigs. A multiplex metabarcoding approach was initially evaluated using healthy olive twigs, and further assessed with naturally infected olive twig samples. Bioinformatic analysis of basecalled reads was carried out using MinKNOW, BLAST+ and R programming, and results were also evaluated using the BugSeq cloud platform. Data analysis highlighted the approaches based on ITS and their combination with beta-tubulin as the most informative ones according to diversity estimations.

527,Review,"Molecular phylogeny has resolved the liverworts as the earliest-divergent clade of land plants and mosses as the sister group to hornworts plus tracheophytes, with alternative topologies resolving the hornworts as sister to mosses plus tracheophytes less well supported. The tracheophytes plus fossil plants putatively lacking lignified vascular tissue form the polysporangiophyte clade. This paper reviews phylogenetic, developmental, anatomical, genetic and paleontological data with the aim of reconstructing the succession of events that shaped major land plant lineages. Fundamental land plant characters primarily evolved in the bryophyte grade, and hence the key to a better understanding of the early evolution of land plants is in bryophytes. The last common ancestor of land plants was probably a leafless axial gametophyte bearing simple unisporangiate sporophytes. Water-conducting tissue, if present, was restricted to the gametophyte and presumably consisted of perforate cells similar to those in the early-divergent bryophytes Haplomitrium and Takakia. Stomata were a sporophyte innovation with the possible ancestral functions of producing a transpiration-driven flow of water and solutes from the parental gametophyte and facilitating spore separation before release. Stomata in mosses, hornworts and polysporangiophytes are viewed as homologous, and hence these three lineages are collectively referred to as the ostomatophytes'. An indeterminate sporophyte body (the sporophyte shoot) developing from an apical meristem was the key innovation in polysporangiophytes. Poikilohydry is the ancestral condition in land plants; homoiohydry evolved in the sporophyte of polysporangiophytes. Fungal symbiotic associations ancestral to modern arbuscular mycorrhizas evolved in the gametophytic generation before the separation of major present-living lineages. Hydroids are imperforate water-conducting cells specific to advanced mosses. Xylem vascular cells in polysporangiophytes arose either from perforate cells or de novo. Food-conducting cells were a very early innovation in land plant evolution. The inferences presented here await testing by molecular genetics.","Ligrone, R; Duckett, JG; Renzaglia, KS",NA,NA,NA,"Ligrone, Roberto; Duckett, Jeffrey G.; Renzaglia, Karen S.",NA,Major transitions in the evolution of early land plants: a bryological perspective,ANNALS OF BOTANY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ligrone, Roberto/GVU-6415-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0305-7364,1095-8290,NA,NA,NA,APR,2012,109,5,NA,NA,NA,851,871,NA,10.1093/aob/mcs017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcs017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,22356739,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000301971900005,NA,527,NA

We used next-generation sequencing of the ITS2 region to describe the complete foliar fungal microbiomes in a set of field-grown tall fescue plants over two years, and whether these fungal communities were affected by the presence of Epichloe. We used the Georgia 5 cultivar of tall fescue, grown in the field for six years prior to sampling.

530,Presence,"Orchids are critically dependent on fungi for seedling establishment and growth, so the distribution and diversity of orchids might depend on the associated fungal communities. We characterised the communities associated with eight orchid species in three Mediterranean protected areas, using a combination of above-ground analyses of sporophores and below-ground molecular analyses of orchid root samples. In three years of sporophore collection in 25 plots around flowering orchid plants, 268 macrofungal species belonging to 84 genera were observed. Statistical analyses indicated a correlation between macrofungal diversity and orchid community variation, regardless of the effect of environmental and spatial factors characterizing the investigated orchid sites. Fungal ITS-DNA PCR amplification, cloning, and sequencing revealed Rhizoctonia-like fungi belonging to Ceratobasidiaceae (26 %), Tulasnellaceae (22.5 %), and Sebacinaceae (3.5 %), as well as other basidiomycetes and ascomycetes, in the roots of 99 orchid plants. Mycorrhizal specificity was low but co-occurring orchid species showed preferences for diffeent partners. The diverse macrofungal communities found in the sites may contribute to orchid community variation without colonizing the orchid roots. Molecular analyses revealed a segregation of associated fungi, which may contribute to Mediterranean orchid coexistence in nature. © 2018 International Mycological Association.",Pecoraro L.; Caruso T.; Cai L.; Gupta V.K.; Liu Z.-J.,NA,,NA,"Pecoraro, Lorenzo (54898762400); Caruso, Tancredi (7003382204); Cai, Lei (55653935100); Gupta, Vijai Kumar (36158104300); Liu, Zhong-Jian (56101469900)",NA,Fungal networks and orchid distribution: New insights from above- and below-ground analyses of fungal communities,IMA Fungus,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,,,,NA,Endophytic fungi; Macrofungal communities; Mediterranean; Molecular ecology; Mycorrhizas; Orchid-fungus relationships; Spatial distributionSpecies coexistence,,"Pecoraro L., Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Orchid Conservation and Utilization, The National Orchid Conservation Center of China and The Orchid Conservation and Research Center of Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518114, China, Center for Biotechnology and oBioMedicine and Division of Life and Health Sciences, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, 518055, China, State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; Caruso T., School of Biological Sciences, Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland, BT9 7BL, United Kingdom; Cai L., State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; Gupta V.K., Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, ERA Chair of Green Chemistry, School of Science, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, 12618, Estonia; Liu Z.-J., Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Orchid Conservation and Utilization, The National Orchid Conservation Center of China and The Orchid Conservation and Research Center of Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518114, China","Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Orchid Conservation and Utilization, The National Orchid Conservation Center of China and The Orchid Conservation and Research Center of Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518114, China; Center for Biotechnology and oBioMedicine and Division of Life and Health Sciences, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, 518055, China; State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; School of Biological Sciences, Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland, BT9 7BL, United Kingdom; Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, ERA Chair of Green Chemistry, School of Science, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, 12618, Estonia","L.

531,Presence,"Many wild and cultivated cool-season grass species are naturally infected with fungal endophytes of the genera Neotyphodium and Epichloë. These associations generally are considered mutualistic with the plants benefiting from reduced herbivory and the fungi benefiting from nutrients supplied by the plants. The fungi secrete proteins that might have a role in the interspecies symbiosis. In the interaction between Poa ampla Merr. and the endophyte Neotyphodium sp., a fungal chitinase was detected in the apoplastic protein fraction. The chitinase was also the major protein secreted in culture. Sequence analysis of the chitinase revealed it has a low level of amino acid sequence identity to other fungal chitinases and one of the conserved active site residues is altered. DNA gel-blot analysis indicated the chitinase was encoded by a single gene. Expression of similar chitinases also was detected in endophyte-infected tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and Chewings fescue (Festuca rubra L. subsp. fallax [Thuill] Nyman). This is the first report of an endophyte chitinase expressed in the infected host grass.

532,Presence,"Fungal endophytes are diverse and widespread symbionts that occur in the living tissues of all lineages of plants without causing evidence of disease. Culture-based and culture-free studies indicate that they often are abundant in the leaves of woody angiosperms, but only a few studies have visualized endophytic fungi in leaf tissues, and the process through which most endophytes colonize leaves has not been studied thoroughly. We inoculated leaf discs and the living leaves of a model woody angiosperm, Populus trichocarpa, which has endophytes that represent three distantly-related genera (Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Trichoderma). We used scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy to evaluate the timeline and processes by which they colonize leaf tissue. Under laboratory conditions with high humidity, conidia germinated on leaf discs to yield hyphae that grew epiphytically and incidentally entered stomata, but did not grow in a directed fashion toward stomatal openings. No cuticular penetration was observed. The endophytes readily colonized the interiors of leaf discs that were detached from living leaves, and could be visualized within discs with light microscopy. Although they were difficult to visualize within the interior of living leaves following in vivo inoculations, standard methods for isolating foliar endophytes confirmed their presence.","Huang, YL; Zimmerman, NB; Arnold, AE",NA,NA,NA,"Huang, Yu-Ling; Zimmerman, Naupaka B.; Arnold, A.

533,Other,"Cadmium (Cd) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) are frequently detected in agricultural soils, which poses a threat to public health. This study investigated the effects of inoculation of king grass with Piriformospora indica on the remediation of soils co-contaminated with Cd and DDTs. After treatment for 90 days, the dry shoot and root biomass of king grass inoculated with P. indica markedly increased by 13.0-15.8% and 24.1-46.4%, respectively, compared with those of uninoculated plants. Inoculation with P. indica also increased the uptake of Cd and DDTs by shoots and roots of king grass. The removal efficiency of Cd and DDTs from soils reached 4.88-17.4% and 48.4-51.0%, respectively, in the presence of king grass inoculated with P. indica. Under three Cd-DDTs contamination conditions, root secretion of organic acids, alcohol, and polyamines was distinctively stimulated by P. indica inoculation of king grass compared with planting king grass alone. After phytor-emediation, changes in soil bacterial and fungal community composition occurred at different contamination levels. Overall, the results showed that king grass associated with P. indica can be adopted for phytoextraction of Cd and DDTs from moderately contaminated soils by regulating root excretion and reshaping rhizosphere mi-crobial community structure.","Li, D; Zheng, XX; Lin, L; An, QL; Jiao, YQ; Li, QL; Li, ZD; Hong, Y; Zhang, KL; Xie, C; Yin, J; Zhang, HX; Wang, BJ; Hu, YM; Zhu, ZQ",NA,NA,NA,"Li, Dong; Zheng, Xiaoxiao; Lin, Li; An, Qianli; Jiao, Yangqiu; Li, Qiuli; Li, Zhidong; Hong, Yi; Zhang, Kailu; Xie, Can; Yin, Jing; Zhang, Haixiang; Wang, Baijie; Hu, Yueming; Zhu, Zhiqiang",NA,Remediation of soils co-contaminated with cadmium and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes by king grass associated with<i> Piriformospora</i><i> indica:</i> Insights into the regulation of root excretion and reshaping of rhizosphere microbial community structure,JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lin, lirong/C-1953-2008; An, Qianli/D-5321-2015",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0304-3894,1873-3336,NA,NA,NA,15-Jan,2022,422,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126936,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126936,NA,21-Aug,NA,NA,NA,NA,34463272,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000709306900001,NA,NA,NA

535,Other,"DNA fingerprinting using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers was employed to investigate the genetic variation within and among populations of Miscanthus Anderss. sinensis var. condensatus (Hack.) Makino, an apomictic grass distributed along the coasts of Taiwan and Ryukyu Islands. A total of 250 plants from three Taiwanese populations (Southeast Coast, Orchid Islet, and Green Islet) and two populations from Ryukyu (Ishigaki and Amami-O-Shima Islets) were sampled. The amplified products of 40 random primers showed monomorphic banding patterns within all populations as well as among the three populations from Taiwan. Low genetic variation (with only two polymorphic loci), but significant differentiation, was detected between populations from Taiwan and Ryukyu (φCT = 0.864) and between populations (φST= 1.0) from lshigaki and Amami-O-Shima Islets. In contrast, a high level of variation was exhibited in the outcrossing Miscanthus sinensis var. glaber (Nakai) Li. In addition to apomictic reproduction, low genetic variation across populations of M. sinensis var. condensatus may be a result of high salinity acting as a selective agent. With the cost of reduced genetic heterogeneity, apomixis may have provided a mechanism for avoiding the transmission of endophytic fungi.

537,Other,"Air pollution caused by tropospheric ozone contributes to the decline of forest ecosystems; for instance, sacred fir, Abies religiosa (Kunth) Schltdl. & Cham. forests in the peri-urban region of Mexico City. Individual trees within these forests exhibit variation in their response to ozone exposure, including the severity of visible symptoms in needles. Using RNA-Seq metatranscriptomic data and ITS2 metabarcoding, we investigated whether symptom variation correlates with the taxonomic and functional composition of fungal mycobiomes from needles collected in this highly polluted area in the surroundings of Mexico City. Our findings indicate that ozone-related symptoms do not significantly correlate with changes in the taxonomic composition of fungal mycobiomes. However, genes coding for 30 putative proteins were differentially expressed in the mycobiome of asymptomatic needles, including eight genes previously associated with resistance to oxidative stress. These results suggest that fungal communities likely play a role in mitigating the oxidative burst caused by tropospheric ozone in sacred fir. Our study illustrates the feasibility of using RNA-Seq data, accessible from global sequence repositories, for the characterization of fungal communities associated with plant tissues, including their gene expression.","Flores-Almaraz, VS; Truong, C; Hernández-Oaxaca, D; Reyes-Galindo, V; Mastretta-Yanes, A; Jaramillo-Correa, JP; Salas-Lizana, R",NA,NA,NA,"Flores-Almaraz, Valeria Stephany; Truong, Camille; Hernandez-Oaxaca, Diana; Reyes-Galindo, Veronica; Mastretta-Yanes, Alicia; Jaramillo-Correa, Juan Pablo; Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo",NA,Foliar mycobiome remains unaltered under urban air-pollution but differentially express stress-related genes,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mastretta, Alicia/KTI-1558-2024; Truong, Camille/R-7670-2019; Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo/LCL-2439-2024","Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo/0000-0002-0761-2910; Reyes-Galindo, Veronica/0000-0003-0688-2203; Mastretta-Yanes, Alicia/0000-0003-2951-6353; Jaramillo-Correa, Juan P./0000-0001-7617-913X; Hernandez Oaxaca, Diana/0000-0001-6218-8297; Truong, Camille/0000-0002-8510-1761; Flores Almaraz, Valeria/0009-0003-8601-8462",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0095-3628,1432-184X,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2024,87,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1007/s00248-024-02387-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-024-02387-y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38755460,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001227211200001,NA,NA,NA
538,Other,"Extraneous DNA interferes with PCR studies of endophytic fungi. A procedure was developed with which to evaluate the removal of extraneous DNA. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) leaves were sprayed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and then subjected to physical and chemical surface treatments. The fungal ITS1 products were amplified from whole tissue DNA extractions. ANOVA was performed on the DNA bands representing S. cerevisiae on the agarose gel. Band profile comparisons using permutational multivariate ANOVA (PERMANOVA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) were performed on DGGE gel data, and band numbers were compared between treatments. Leaf surfaces were viewed under variable pressure scanning electron microscopy (VPSEM). Yeast band analysis of the agarose gel showed that there was no significant difference in the mean band DNA quantity after physical and chemical treatments, but they both differed significantly (p < 0.05) from the untreated control. PERMANOVA revealed a significant difference between all treatments (p < 0.05). The mean similarity matrix showed that the physical treatment results were more reproducible than those from the chemical treatment results. The NMDS showed that the physical treatment was the most consistent. VPSEM indicated that the physical treatment was the most effective treatment to remove surface microbes and debris. The use of molecular and microscopy methods for the post-treatment detection of yeast inoculated onto wheat leaf surfaces demonstrated the effectiveness of the surface treatment employed, and this can assist researchers in optimizing their surface sterilization techniques in DNA-based fungal endophyte studies. © 2014, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.",Burgdorf R.J.; Laing M.D.; Morris C.D.; Jamal-Ally S.F.,NA,,NA,"Burgdorf, R.J.

539,Other,"Considering the potential threat of vegetables growing in antibiotic-polluted soil with high abundance of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) against human health through the food chain, it is thus urgent to develop novel control technology to ensure vegetable safety. In the present work, pot experiments were conducted in lettuce cultivation to assess the impedance effect of biochar amendment on soil sulfonamides (SAs), antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), and ARG enrichment in lettuce tissues. After 100 days of cultivation, lettuce cultivation with biochar amendment exhibited the greatest soil SA dissipation as well as the significant improvement of lettuce growth indices, with residual soil SAs mainly existing as the tightly bound fraction. Moreover, the SA contents in roots and new/old leaves were reduced by one to two orders of magnitude compared to those without biochar amendment. In addition, isolate counts for SA-resistant bacterial endophytes in old leaves and sul gene abundances in roots and old leaves also decreased significantly after biochar application. However, neither SA resistant bacteria nor sul genes were detected in new leaves. It was the first study to demonstrate that biochar amendment can be a practical strategy to protect lettuce safety growing in SA-polluted soil with rich ARB and ARGs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Ye M.; Sun M.; Feng Y.; Wan J.; Xie S.; Tian D.; Zhao Y.; Wu J.; Hu F.; Li H.; Jiang X.,NA,,NA,"Ye, Mao (57200130221); Sun, Mingming (36088000900); Feng, Yanfang (54386661100); Wan, Jinzhong (16319864300); Xie, Shanni (56927338200); Tian, Da (56717191800); Zhao, Yu (59050815500); Wu, Jun (57203272581); Hu, Feng (7202526324); Li, Huixin (8542795700); Jiang, Xin (57214068210)",NA,"Effect of biochar amendment on the control of soil sulfonamides, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and gene enrichment in lettuce tissues",Journal of Hazardous Materials,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,,,,NA,ARB; ARGs; Biochar addition; Impedance effect; Lettuce cultivation,"Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Charcoal; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Food Contamination; Genes, Bacterial; Lettuce; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants; Sulfonamides; Bacteria (microorganisms); Lactuca; Amides; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Bacteriology; Cultivation; Genes; Health risks; Histology; Soil pollution; Sulfur compounds; Tissue; Vegetables; biochar; charcoal; RNA 16S; sulfonamide; unclassified drug; vegetable protein; antiinfective agent; bacterial RNA; biochar; charcoal; soil pollutant; sulfonamide; Antibiotic-resistant bacteria; Antibiotic-resistant genes; ARGs; Bacterial endophytes; Bio chars; Control technologies; Orders of magnitude; Resistant bacteria; antibiotic resistance; bacterium; charcoal; cultivation; drug; gene; growth rate; leaf; leafy vegetable; residual soil; root system; soil amendment; antibiotic resistant bacteria; antibiotic resistant gene; Article; bacterial gene; bioaccumulation; bound fraction; chemical composition; chlorophyll content; concentration (parameters); controlled study; dry weight; endophyte; endophytic fungus; fresh weight; gene dosage; genetic analysis; lettuce; nonhuman; plant growth; plant leaf; plant root; plant tissue; root growth; soil amendment; soil property; surface area; antibiotic resistance; bacterial gene; bacterium; chemistry; food contamination; genetics; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; prevention and control; soil pollutant; Soils","Ye M., State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, China; Sun M., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Feng Y., Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, 210014, China; Wan J., Nanjing Institute of Environmental Science, Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, Nanjing, 210042, China; Xie S., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Tian D., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Zhao Y., Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Photonic and Electronic Materials, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China; Wu J., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Hu F., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Li H., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Jiang X., State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, China","State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, China; Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, 210014, China; Nanjing Institute of Environmental Science, Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, Nanjing, 210042, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Photonic and Electronic Materials, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China","Y.

Biomass production was determined in liquid media amended with NaCl or polyethylene glycol to give osmotic potentials of -0.05 to -2.24 MPa. Regardless of the osmoticum, biomass yields of all isolates at the highest level of imposed water stress (-2.24 MPa) did not differ significantly from, or were significantly higher than, those at the lowest level of water stress. The data suggest that the endophyte isolates possess considerable resistance to water stress and may be of functional importance to their plant hosts under water-stress conditions.","Chen, DM; Khalili, K; Cairney, JWG",NA,NA,NA,"Chen, DM; Khalili, K; Cairney, JWG",NA,Influence of water stress on biomass production by isolates of an ericoid mycorrhizal endophyte of <i>Woollsia pungens</i> and <i>Epacris microphylla</i> (Ericaceae),MYCORRHIZA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0940-6360,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2003,13,3,NA,NA,NA,173,176,NA,10.1007/s00572-003-0228-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-003-0228-7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12836087,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000184017500009,NA,NA,NA
541,Other,"Neotyphodium endophytic fungi, the asexual state of Epichloe species, protect cool-season grasses against stresses. The outcomes of Neotyphodium-grass symbioses are agronomically relevant as they may affect the productivity of pastures. It has been suggested that the mutualism is characteristic of agronomic grasses and that differential rates of gene flow between both partners' populations are expected to disrupt the specificity of the association and, thus, the mutualism in wild grasses. We propose that compatibility is necessary but not sufficient to explain the outcomes of Neotyphodium-grass symbiosis, and advance a model that links genetic compatibility, mutualism effectiveness, and endophyte transmission efficiency. For endophytes that reproduce clonally and depend on allogamous hosts for reproduction and dissemination, we propose that this symbiosis works as an integrated entity where gene flow promotes its fitness and evolution. Compatibility between the host plant and the fungal endophyte would be high in genetically close parents; however, mutualism effectiveness and transmission efficiency would be low in fitness depressed host plants. Increasing the genetic distance of mating parents would increase mutualism effectiveness and transmission efficiency. This tendency would be broken when the genetic distance between parents is high (out-breeding depression). Our model allows for testable hypotheses that would contribute to understand the coevolutionary origin and future of the endophyte-grass mutualism.","Gundel, PE; Omacini, M; Sadras, VO; Ghersa, CM",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro E.; Omacini, Marina; Sadras, Victor O.; Ghersa, Claudio M.",NA,The interplay between the effectiveness of the grass-endophyte mutualism and the genetic variability of the host plant,EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Sadras, Victor/D-5122-2013","Sadras, Victor/0000-0002-5874-6775; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Omacini, Marina/0000-0003-1460-262X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1752-4571,NA,NA,NA,NA,SEP,2010,3,6-May,NA,NA,NA,538,546,NA,10.1111/j.1752-4571.2010.00152.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-4571.2010.00152.x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25567945,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000281311700012,NA,NA,NA
542,Other,"The rapid invasion of the non-native Phragmites australis (Poaceae, subfamily Arundinoideae) is a major threat to native wetland ecosystems in North America and elsewhere. We describe the first reference genome for P. australis and compare invasive (ssp. australis) and native (ssp. americanus) genotypes collected from replicated populations across the Laurentian Great Lakes to deduce genomic bases driving its invasive success. Here, we report novel genomic features including a Phragmites lineage-specific whole genome duplication, followed by gene loss and preferential retention of genes associated with transcription factors and regulatory functions in the remaining duplicates. Comparative transcriptomic analyses revealed that genes associated with biotic stress and defence responses were expressed at a higher basal level in invasive genotypes, but native genotypes showed a stronger induction of defence responses when challenged by a fungal endophyte. The reference genome and transcriptomes, combined with previous ecological and environmental data, add to our understanding of mechanisms leading to invasiveness and support the development of novel, genomics-assisted management approaches for invasive Phragmites.","Oh, DH; Kowalski, KP; Quach, QN; Wijesinghege, C; Tanford, P; Dassanayake, M; Clay, K",NA,NA,NA,"Oh, Dong-Ha; Kowalski, Kurt P.; Quach, Quynh N.; Wijesinghege, Chathura; Tanford, Philippa; Dassanayake, Maheshi; Clay, Keith",NA,Novel genome characteristics contribute to the invasiveness of <i>Phragmites australis</i> (common reed),MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kowalski, Kurt/GXZ-5008-2022; Dassanayake, Maheshi/B-7331-2012; Oh, Dong-Ha/O-7591-2019","Dassanayake, Maheshi/0000-0003-3123-3731; Quach, Quynh/0000-0001-6504-6358; Kowalski, Kurt/0000-0002-8424-4701; Oh, Dong-Ha/0000-0003-1526-9814",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0962-1083,1365-294X,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2022,31,4,NA,NA,NA,1142,1159,NA,10.1111/mec.16293,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.16293,NA,21-Dec,NA,NA,NA,NA,34839548,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000729123600001,NA,NA,NA
1,Both,"We present a review of the documented fungal colonizations of presumably symbiotic nature in lycophytes and ferns (""pteridophytes""). The sampling covers ca. 11 % (1287 spp.) of the estimated global diversity of these taxa (ca. 12,000 spp.) and shows an average presence of fungal endophytes of 68 %, which is significantly lower than the average presence of mycorrhiza of 80-85 % for the remaining tracheophytes. Above-average colonization rates up to 100 % among ferns are mainly found in phylogenetically old lineages, whereas below-average mycorrhization characterizes the Polypod I clade and the Aspleniaceae of the derived leptosporangiate ferns. Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) are found in 54 % of the species, to which 6 % of unspecified records of mycorrhizae should probably be added. Dark Septate Endophytes (DSE) are found in 13 % of the species, in about half the cases (6 %) together with AMF. Ectomycorrhizae have not been confirmed for pteridophytes so far, and basidiomycetes are found very rarely in mycoheterotropic gametophytes. Fungal endophytes are unevenly distributed across the life forms and most frequent with 75 % in the terrestrial species, followed with 69 % in saxicolous and with 58 % in epiphytic species. Although AMF have a low dispersal potential and thus are considered unreliable symbiotic partners for epiphytes, they are still present in 27 % of the investigated epiphytic pteridophytes. The occurrence of mycorrhizae across the taxa of pteridophytes bears a phylogenetic signal, as the derived ferns show a notable trend towards a growing independence from AM, in epiphytes more pronouncedly so than in terrestrial taxa.","Lehnert, M; Krug, M; Kessler, M",NA,NA,NA,"Lehnert, Marcus; Krug, Michael; Kessler, Michael",NA,A review of symbiotic fungal endophytes in lycophytes and ferns - a global phylogenetic and ecological perspective,SYMBIOSIS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kessler, Michael/A-3605-2009; Lehnert, Marcus/F-3288-2011","Kessler, Michael/0000-0003-4612-9937; Lehnert, Marcus/0000-0002-7202-7734",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0334-5114,1878-7665,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2017,71,2,NA,NA,NA,77,89,NA,10.1007/s13199-016-0436-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-016-0436-5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000395022600001,NA,9410,Both
2,Presence,"Poplars are among the few tree genera that can develop both ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular (AM) associations; however, variable ratios of ECM/AM in dual mycorrhizal colonizations were observed in the roots of a variety of poplar species and hybrids. The objective of our study was to analyze the effect of internal and external factors on growth and dual AM and ECM colonization of poplar roots in three 12-15-year-old common gardens in Poland. We also analyzed the abundance of nonmycorrhizal fungal endophytes in the poplar roots. The Populus clones comprised black poplars (Populus deltoides and P. deltoides × Populus nigra), balsam poplars (Populus maximowiczii × Populus trichocarpa), and a hybrid of black and balsam poplars (P. deltoides × P. trichocarpa). Of the three sites that we studied, one was located in the vicinity of a copper smelter, where soil was contaminated with copper and lead. Poplar root tip abundance, mycorrhizal colonization, and soil fungi biomass were lower at this heavily polluted site. The total mycorrhizal colonization and the ratio of ECM and AM colonization differed among the study sites and according to soil depth. The influence of Populus genotype was significantly pronounced only within the individual study sites. The contribution of nonmycorrhizal fungal endophytes differed among the poplar clones and was higher at the polluted site than at the sites free of pollution. Our results indicate that poplar fine root abundance and AM and ECM symbiosis are influenced by environmental conditions. Further studies of different site conditions are required to characterize the utility of poplars for purposes such as the phytoremediation of polluted sites. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Karliński L.; Rudawska M.; Kieliszewska-Rokicka B.; Leski T.,NA,,NA,"Karliński, Leszek (6508173301); Rudawska, Maria (6603419545); Kieliszewska-Rokicka, Barbara (6603177644); Leski, Tomasz (35409524100)",NA,Relationship between genotype and soil environment during colonization of poplar roots by mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi,Mycorrhiza,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,,,,NA,Arbuscular mycorrhiza; Depth distribution; Ectomycorrhiza; Fine-root colonization; Heavy metals; Populus,"Biomass; Copper; Fungi; Genotype; Lead; Plant Roots; Poland; Populus; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Symbiosis; Poland; Arbuscular; Fungi; Populus; Populus balsamifera; Populus deltoides; Populus maximowiczii; Populus nigra; Populus trichocarpa; copper; lead; abundance; arbuscular mycorrhiza; dicotyledon; ectomycorrhiza; endophyte; fine root; genotype-environment interaction; growth rate; heavy metal; phytoremediation; root colonization; vertical distribution; article; aspen; biomass; fungus; genotype; growth, development and aging; microbiology; physiology; plant root; Poland; soil; soil pollutant; symbiosis","Karliński L., Institute of Dendrology Polish Academy of Sciences, 62-035 Kórnik, Parkowa 5, Poland; Rudawska M., Institute of Dendrology Polish Academy of Sciences, 62-035 Kórnik, Parkowa 5, Poland; Kieliszewska-Rokicka B., Institute of Dendrology Polish Academy of Sciences, 62-035 Kórnik, Parkowa 5, Poland; Leski T., Institute of Dendrology Polish Academy of Sciences, 62-035 Kórnik, Parkowa 5, Poland","Institute of Dendrology Polish Academy of Sciences, 62-035 Kórnik, Parkowa 5, Poland","L.

3,Presence,"Ascomycetes from the genus Claviceps are long-known pathogens of plants, including cereals. Despite of this, no effective fungicide has been developed yet. We checked whether the presence of ergot impacts the size and composition of the mycobiota in rye seeds (Secale cereale). The sizes of spikes and seeds were also checked. To identify endophytes, the fungal isolates were analyzed using molecular markers ITS1 and ITS2. We found nine taxa of fungal endophytes in the studied rye seeds. The most abundantly represented fungus, regardless of ergot presence, was Alternaria infectoria. Seeds from the spikes with and without ergot differed in the presence of two fungal species: Microdochium nivale occurred only in the seeds of spikes with ergot, while Pyrenophora teres only in the seeds of spikes without ergot. No effect of ergot presence in rye spikes on seed size was found. The lack of differences in the size and taxonomical composition of mycobiota and seed size between plants with and without ergot confirms the hypothesis on the benefits of this dangerous for humans pathogen for plants. © 2022.

5,Presence,"Locoweeds including the toxic species of Astragalus spp and Oxytropis spp. are widely distributed in the western region of China and result in a chronic neurological disease known as locoism in animals. To determine the presence of swainsonine-producing fungal endophyte of major locoweed species in China, endophytes were isolated from 8 locoweed species that including A. variabilis, A. strictus, O. glacialis, O. kansuensis, O. ochrocepala, O. sericopetala, O. glabra and O. latibracteata. Seven species of locoweed were confirmed contain substantial amounts of swainsonine and infect swainsonine-producing fungal endophyte. These endophytes were classified as Undifilim oxytropis according to the fungal morphology and phylogenetic analysis based on sufficient ITS sequences. PCR-RFLP analysis of IGS region showed that the interspecific or intraspecific variations were present among the endophytes from different locoweed species. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Yu Y.; Zhao Q.; Wang J.; Wang J.; Wang Y.; Song Y.; Geng G.; Li Q.,NA,,NA,"Yu, Yongtao (56143719000); Zhao, Qingmei (55479212000); Wang, Jianna (35811530400); Wang, Jianhua (56086643600); Wang, Yan (36775570600); Song, Yumin (55494072900); Geng, Guoxia (14044863800); Li, Qinfan (35810725200)",NA,Swainsonine-producing fungal endophytes from major locoweed species in China,Toxicon,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,,,,NA,Fungal endophyte; Intergenic sequence; Locoweed; Swainsonine; Undifilim oxytropis,"Base Sequence; China; Chromatography, Gas; DNA Primers; Fungi; Oxytropis; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Species Specificity; Swainsonine; Animalia; Astragalus (angiosperm); Oxytropis; Oxytropis sericopetala; fungal DNA; internal transcribed spacer; spacer DNA; swainsonine; article; Astragalus plant; Astragalus strictus; Astragalus variabilis; China; controlled study; endophyte; fungal metabolism; fungal morphology; fungal plant disease; fungus isolation; gene amplification; higher plant; locoweed; molecular phylogeny; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Oxytropis; Oxytropis glabra; Oxytropis glacialis; Oxytropis kansuensis; Oxytropis latibracteata; Oxytropis ochrocepala; Oxytropis sericopetala; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; restriction fragment length polymorphism; sequence analysis; species difference; toxin analysis; toxin synthesis; Undifilim oxytropis","Yu Y., College of Animal Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A and F University, Yangling 712100, China, College of Agronomy Ningxia University, Yinchuan 750021, China; Zhao Q., College of Life Sciences and Engineering, North University for Nationalities, Yinchuan 750021, China; Wang J., Hosptial of Northwest A and F University, Yangling 712100, China; Wang J., College of Animal Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A and F University, Yangling 712100, China; Wang Y., College of Animal Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A and F University, Yangling 712100, China; Song Y., College of Animal Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A and F University, Yangling 712100, China; Geng G., College of Animal Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A and F University, Yangling 712100, China; Li Q., College of Animal Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A and F University, Yangling 712100, China","College of Animal Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A and F University, Yangling 712100, China; Hosptial of Northwest A and F University, Yangling 712100, China; College of Agronomy Ningxia University, Yinchuan 750021, China; College of Life Sciences and Engineering, North University for Nationalities, Yinchuan 750021, China","J.

6,Presence,"Bark beetles form symbiotic associations with multiple species of fungi that supplement their metabolic needs. However, the relative contributions of each symbiont to the nutrition of bark beetles have been largely unexplored. Thus, we evaluated the ability of three fungal symbionts of mountain pine beetle to concentrate nitrogen and produce ergosterol while infecting phloem of a novel host jack pine. Ergosterol was used as proxy to determine the fungal biomass (hyphal density) in the current study. We inoculated 80 trees in two forest stands with one of the three fungal species or a non-fungal (control) agar. Six weeks later, we collected phloem from the necrotic lesions induced by the fungi, uninfected tissues adjacent to lesions, and non-inoculated control trees. We found that nutritional contributions varied with fungal species. Nitrogen in lesions was higher in trees inoculated with Ophiostoma montium or control trees, relative to Grosmannia clavigera or Leptographium longiclavatum. Furthermore, concentrations of ergosterol were higher in O. montium lesions compared to other tissues or treatments. These results suggest that O. montium differs from G. clavigera and L. longiclavatum in terms of acquiring nitrogen from host tissues and producing ergosterol. © Copyright © 2020 Guevara-Rozo, Hussain, Cale, Klutsch, Rajabzadeh and Erbilgin.",Guevara-Rozo S.; Hussain A.; Cale J.A.; Klutsch J.G.; Rajabzadeh R.; Erbilgin N.,NA,,NA,"Guevara-Rozo, Sydne (57206857439); Hussain, Altaf (57191483281); Cale, Jonathan A.

7,Both,"Finding toxic, fungal endophyte-infected, grass cultivars that are not avoided by phytophagous insects could be an advantageous strategy when mixing Kentucky bluegrass, Poa pratensis L., and endophyte-infected grasses to control turfgrass pests. Field observations revealed that nymphs of the hairy chinch bug, Blissus lucopterus hirstus Montandon, are found mainly in thatch rather than on plants, regardless of time of day. We therefore developed laboratory bioassays incorporating thatch as a component of the hairy chinch bug habitat as a Ist step toward searching for advantageous grass-endophyte associations for chinch bug management in northeastern America. In nonchoice tests, a high incidence of endophyte (Neotyphodium) infection in tillers of the perennial ryegrass 'Prelude II', Lolium perenne L., induced high mortality of 3rd instars, whereas Prelude II with lower incidence of infected tillers or the Kentucky bluegrass 'Merit' were significantly more suitable. Incidence of infected plants affected nymph habitat selection, because all individuals in the presence of Prelude II with elevated percentage of infected tillers were found in thatch, whereas a significantly higher proportion of plants was colonized by nymphs confined with Prelude II with a lower incidence of endophyte infection or with Merit. In choice tests, Merit was strongly preferred over Prelude Ii, regardless of endophyte status of the ryegrass. Moreover, nymph mortality was not affected by the presence of endophyte-infected Prelude II when Merit was also available. These results suggest that highly mobile 3rd-instar hairy chinch bugs have the capacity to avoid toxic endophyte-infected grass cultivars. Such behavior could limit the value of mixing endophyte-infected grasses with Kentucky bluegrass for lawn protection, unless toxic cultivars that are not avoided by the hairy chinch bug can be found.","Carrière, Y; Bouchard, A; Bourassa, S; Brodeur, J",NA,NA,NA,"Carrière, Y; Bouchard, A; Bourassa, S; Brodeur, J",NA,"Effect of endophyte incidence in perennial ryegrass on distribution, host-choice, and performance of the hairy chinch bug (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae)",JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0022-0493,NA,NA,NA,NA,FEB,1998,91,1,NA,NA,NA,324,328,NA,10.1093/jee/91.1.324,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/91.1.324,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000073139800045,NA,3396,Both
8,Both,"The common forage grass Lolium perenne has evolved with the systemic fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae var. lolii. The endophyte provides herbivore resistance to the grass due to defensive alkaloids, some of which are toxic to grazing livestock. In this field study, we determine whether distribution of the endophyte-grass association changes along a land-use intensity gradient on 87 managed grasslands in three German regions. Endophyte infections were detected in 66% of the studied sites and infection rates within infected sites ranged from 1% to 95%. Alkaloid concentrations of lolitrem B (vertebrate toxin) exceeded the toxicity thresholds in 50 (14%) of 351 infected plants and of peramine (invertebrate deterrent/toxin) in 12 (3%) of 351 plants. Infection rates and alkaloid concentrations were not significantly affected by land-use intensity and region, but alkaloid concentrations were higher in summer compared to spring. We conclude that risks for livestock intoxication are currently low, as (i) average alkaloid concentrations per grassland were always below toxicity thresholds and as (ii) none of the grasslands was dominated by L.perenne. We suggest avoidance of grass monocultures in Europe to keep intoxication risks for livestock low; we also recommend regular examination of seeds and grasslands, as seed producers might accidentally distribute infected seeds, and as climate warming might further enhance the distribution of Epichloe endophytes in European grasslands.","König, J; Fuchs, B; Krischke, M; Mueller, MJ; Krauss, J",NA,NA,NA,"Koenig, J.; Fuchs, B.; Krischke, M.; Mueller, M.

9,Both,"Clethra barbinervis Sieb. et Zucc. is a tree species that grows naturally at several mine sites and seems to be tolerant of high concentrations of heavy metals, such as Cu, Zn, and Pb. The purpose of this study is to clarify the mechanism(s) underlying this species' ability to tolerate the sites' severe heavy-metal pollution by considering C. barbinervis interaction with root fungal endophytes. We measured the heavy metal concentrations of root-zone soil, leaves, branches, and fine roots collected from mature C. barbinervis at Hitachi mine. We isolated fungal endophytes from surface-sterilized root segments, and we examined the growth, and heavy metal and nutrient absorption of C. barbinervis seedlings growing in sterilized mine soil with or without root fungal endophytes. Field analyses showed that C. barbinervis contained considerably high amounts of Cu, Zn, and Pb in fine roots and Zn in leaves. The fungi, Phialocephala fortinii, Rhizodermea veluwensis, and Rhizoscyphus sp. were frequently isolated as dominant fungal endophyte species. Inoculation of these root fungal endophytes to C. barbinervis seedlings growing in sterilized mine soil indicated that these fungi significantly enhanced the growth of C. barbinervis seedlings, increased K uptake in shoots and reduced the concentrations of Cu, Ni, Zn, Cd, and Pb in roots. Without root fungal endophytes, C. barbinervis could hardly grow under the heavy-metal contaminated condition, showing chlorosis, a symptom of heavy-metal toxicity. Our results indicate that the tree C. barbinervis can tolerate high heavy-metal concentrations due to the support of root fungal endophytes including P. fortinii, R. veluwensis, and Rhizoscyphus sp. via growth enhancement, K uptake promotion and decrease of heavy metal concentrations. © 2016 Yamaji et al.

10,Presence,"Plant fungal relationships should vary with abiotic and biotic factors to minimise plant stress and are likely to vary seasonally and with age. We investigated how fungal colonisation, specifically arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate fungal endophytes, would vary with species identity and season, and how these interactions change with ontogeny. Plant roots of adults and seedlings of 9 species were collected from heathland and coastal dune habitats along the Australian east coast in New South Wales. Roots were stained and investigated for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophyte structures to determine colonisation strength. Species identity was the most important factor driving colonisation strength, while low rainfall and heatwaves were associated with declining arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonisation in the warmest sampling period. AMF colonisation may be supressed by plants under heat and water stress as a way of avoiding loss of limited photosynthates. Dark septate endophyte colonisation was more common in this time period and may assist with the stress of the warmer, drier conditions. Colonisation by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi differed with age but in unpredictable ways and, along with dark septate endophytes, was evident even in plants that are considered non-mycorrhizal, although more extensive in known mycorrhizal species. The lack of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonisation and the increase in dark septate endophyte colonisation during the most stressful period suggest an uncoupling mechanism in the symbiotic relationship which needs further investigation.","Rayment, JT; Jones, S; French, K",NA,NA,NA,"Rayment, Julia T.; Jones, Shae; French, Kris",NA,Seasonal patterns of fungal colonisation in Australian native plants of different ages,SYMBIOSIS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"; French, Kris/I-8202-2012","Rayment, Julia/0000-0003-2612-9980; French, Kris/0000-0001-6938-2017",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0334-5114,1878-7665,NA,NA,NA,MAR,2020,80,2,NA,NA,NA,169,182,NA,10.1007/s13199-019-00661-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-019-00661-z,NA,20-Jan,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000505413900001,NA,6081,Both
11,Both,"In order to improve knowledge of Neotyphodium-like fungi in European grasses, microscopic detection of endophytic mycelium was achieved in living grasses and in seeds. Samples of grasses were gathered near permanent pastures or along paths in France (93 samples, 13 genera, 22 species). Typical convoluted mycelium was found inside leaf sheaths of four genera, especially in Festuca and Lolium spp. The results suggest that endophytes were present most often in the southern regions where plants may suffer from summer drought. Endophytes were looked for in 489 seed samples (63 genera, 237 species) received from 24 European botanical gardens. Neotyphodium was found in seeds of only six genera (22 species), especially in Festuca (15 species) and Lolium (three species). No endophytic mycelium was found in the other 215 species, although other work had demonstrated the presence of the fungus in 39 of the species analysed. Neotyphodium-like mycelium was detected for the first time in Festuca juncifolia, F. trachyphylla, F. vaginata, F. pseudodalmatica, F. rupicaprina, F. arenaria, Vulpia ciliata and Micropyrum tenellum.

12,Both,"We evaluated tritrophic level interactions among fungal endophytes (Acremonium spp.) of fescue grasses (Festuca spp.), the root-feeding Japanese beetle Popillia japonica Newman larvae, and the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora Poinar. Third-instar P. japonica larvae were introduced into pots containing endophyte-infected or endophyte-free plants of tall fescue Festuca arundinacea Schreber (cultivars Kentucky 31 and Georgia Jesup Improved) and the Chewings fescue Festuca rubra commutata Guad. (cultivars F-93 and Jamestown II). After two weeks, the surviving larvae were recovered, and their susceptibility to nematodes was evaluated in sand columns. Endophytes enhanced the rate of nematode-induced mortality in all cultivars except Georgia Jesup Improved, and increased the proportion of dead larvae with nematodes in all cultivars except Jamestown II. Endophytes in the cultivar Kentucky 31 were associated with improved nematode establishment in the larvae. No effect on nematode reproduction was found. Since endophytes produce biologically active alkaloids, we tested the effects of an ergot alkaloid, ergotamine tartrate, on the feeding behavior and weight of P. japonica larvae in agar medium. The alkaloid caused feeding deterrence, and reduced the consumption of medium by the larvae, resulting in weight loss. These larvae were more susceptible to H. bacteriophora than the untreated larvae. Unfed 'starved' larvae were more susceptible to nematodes than those fed on untreated agar. Our results support the hypothesis that endophyte-induced starvation of P. japonica would reduce larval vigor, and render them more susceptible to entomopathogenic nematodes.","GREWAL, SK; GREWAL, PS; GAUGLER, R",NA,NA,NA,"GREWAL, SK; GREWAL, PS; GAUGLER, R",NA,ENDOPHYTES OF FESCUE GRASSES ENHANCE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF POPILLIA-JAPONICA LARVAE TO AN ENTOMOPATHOGENIC NEMATODE,ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Grewal, Satvir Kaur/JPX-1648-2023; Gaugler, Randy/K-3898-2013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0013-8703,1570-7458,NA,NA,NA,MAR,1995,74,3,NA,NA,NA,219,224,NA,10.1111/j.1570-7458.1995.tb01894.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1995.tb01894.x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1995QU36100004,NA,9346,Both
13,Presence,"Locoweeds are defined as Astragalus and Oxytropis species that induce locoism due to the toxic alkaloid swainsonine. Swainsonine was detected in all parts of Astragalus lentiginosus and Astragalus mollissimus, with greater concentrations found in the aboveground parts. Undifilum oxytropis, a fungal endophyte responsible for the synthesis of swainsonine, was detected in all plant parts of A. lentiginosus and A. mollissimus. The amount of endophyte within a plant part does not always correspond to the concentration of swainsonine in the same part. Plants of A. mollissimus and A. lentiginosus can be divided into two chemotypes: those that contain swainsonine (>0.1%; chemotype 1) and those that contain little or no detectable swainsonine (<0.01%; chemotype 2). Chemotype 1 plants in both species had quantitatively higher amounts of endophyte compared to chemotype 2 plants. Swainsonine and endophyte amounts were not uniformly distributed within stalks of the same plant. For that reason, repeated sampling of stalks from the same plant during one growing season may provide misleading results. Sequence variants of U. oxytropis exist within populations of A. mollissimus, A. lentiginosus, and Oxytropis sericea and do not correlate with chemotype.

We imposed drought conditions on 116Festuca arundinacea(tall fescue) accessions using a rainout shelter for 46 days, followed by irrigation, to stimulate drought recovery in 24 days. We hypothesized that prolonged water deficit results in a range of phenotypic diversity (i.e., green color index) across tall fescue genotypes that are associated with distinct microbial taxonomic and functional traits impacting plant drought tolerance. Microbial extracellular enzyme activities of chitinase and phenol oxidase (targeting chitin and lignin) increased in rhizospheres of the 20 most drought tolerant genotypes. Lower rates of fungal (dark septate) endophyte root infection were found in roots of the most drought tolerant genotypes. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS sequencing showed shifts in microbial communities across water deficit conditions prior to drought, during drought, and at drought recovery, but was not patterned by drought tolerance levels of the plant host. The results suggest that taxonomic information from bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS sequences provided little indication of microbial composition impacting drought tolerance of the host plant, but instead, microbial extracellular enzyme activities and root fungal infection results revealed patterned responses from drought.","Panke-Buisse, K; Cheng, L; Gan, HJ; Wickings, K; Petrovic, M; Kao-Kniffin, J",NA,NA,NA,"Panke-Buisse, Kevin; Cheng, Liang; Gan, Huijie; Wickings, Kyle; Petrovic, Marty; Kao-Kniffin, Jenny",NA,Root Fungal Endophytes and Microbial Extracellular Enzyme Activities Show Patterned Responses in Tall Fescues under Drought Conditions,AGRONOMY-BASEL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cheng, Liang/AAG-1987-2021","Panke-Buisse, Kevin/0000-0001-8555-1255; Cheng, Liang/0000-0001-6875-2928; Kao-Kniffin, Jenny/0000-0002-9469-8088",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2073-4395,NA,NA,NA,AUG,2020,10,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3390/agronomy10081076,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10081076,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000567651400001,NA,6122,Both

Four plant genotypes with (E+) and without (experimentally removed, E-) their respective haplotypes (two haplotypes in two plant genotypes) of Neotyphodium were grown in the field under manipulated soil moisture and nutrients. Peramine production required the presence of the endophyte; plants without their endophytes did not contain peramine. Whereas the endophyte was necessary for peramine production, levels of peramine did not vary by Neotyphodium haplotype within plant genotypes. Furthermore, peramine levels did not differ among soil moisture and nutrient treatments, and growth and reproductive measures of the host grass explained little of variation in peramine levels. Instead, peramine levels differed significantly between plant genotypes harboring the same endophyte haplotype, suggesting that plant genotype, rather than endophyte haplotype or environment, largely determines levels of peramine in Arizona fescue. The results suggest that whereas the endophyte is required for peramine production, the plant genotypic background in which the endophyte is embedded, rather than endophyte haplotype or environmental factors, mostly influences peramine levels within this population of Arizona fescue.","Faeth, SH; Bush, LP; Sullivan, TJ",NA,NA,NA,"Faeth, SH; Bush, LP; Sullivan, TJ",NA,Peramine alkaloid variation in <i>Neotyphodium</i>-infected Arizona fescue:: Effects of endophyte and host genotype and environment,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0098-0331,NA,NA,NA,NA,AUG,2002,28,8,NA,NA,NA,1511,1526,NA,10.1023/A:1019916227153,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1019916227153,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12371807,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000177722600002,NA,9343,Both
16,Both,"Cool-season grasses are frequently infected by Neotyphodium endophytes and this association is often considered as a mutualistic symbiosis. We examined the incidence of Neotyphodium in populations of Bromus setifolius, Phleum alpinum and Poa spiciformis, native and wide-spread grasses from south Patagonia, Argentina. The incidence of 36 populations of Bromus setifolius was studied in association with climatic and soil variables. 31 populations of Ph. alpinum were sampled in five different plant communities. Seventeen populations of P. spiciformis were sampled in three different plant communities. The association between incidence and climatic variables in Ph. alpinum and between incidence and soil fertility in P. spiciformis was investigated. In B. setifolius endophyte incidence was positively correlated with annual average rainfall contrary to the results found in Ph. alpinum. All the populations of P. spiciformis were infected by endophytes and the incidence was associated with plant community. The Neotyphodium-grass interaction is variable in natural populations, supporting the increasing evidence that the Neotyphodium-host interaction depends, in many cases, on the environmental conditions.

Significant correlations between richness and diversity indices were observed (p < 0.05), and mycobiomes did not differ between habitats in the current study. Species richness and diversity were higher in twigs compared to spring buds, and the assemblages in twigs shared most similarities. Interaction network analyses revealed that twig-bound fungi shared similar numbers of (interaction) links with others, dominated by negative co-occurrences, suggesting that competitive exclusion may be the predominant ecological interaction in the highly connected twig mycobiome.

Taxa in Ascomycota class Dothideomycetes, particularly the generaAlternariaandCladosporium, were the most abundant and prevalent across all populations, but there was also high incidence of basidiomyceteous yeasts of the class Tremellomycetes. The fungal community was shaped to large extent by stochastic processes, as indicated by high level of variation even between individuals from local populations of the same plant species, and confirmed by the neutral community model and Raup-Crick index. Nevertheless, we still found strong determinism in FEC assembly with both incidence and abundance data sets. Substantial differences in community composition across host species and locations were revealed. Our research demonstrated that assembly of FECs is affected by stochastic as well as deterministic processes and suggests strong effects of environment heterogeneity and plant species on community composition. In addition, a small number of taxa had high incidence and abundance in all of the 15 populations. These taxa represent an important part of the core FEC and might be of general functional importance.","Sun, X; Kosman, E; Sharon, O; Ezrati, S; Sharon, A",NA,NA,NA,"Sun, Xiang; Kosman, Evsey; Sharon, Or; Ezrati, Smadar; Sharon, Amir",NA,Significant host- and environment-dependent differentiation among highly sporadic fungal endophyte communities in cereal crops-related wild grasses,ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sun, Xiang/J-9207-2012; Kosman, Evsey/AAB-8207-2022","Kosman, Evsey/0000-0002-6121-063X; sun (Sun), xiang (Xiang)/0000-0002-6875-4971; Sharon, Or/0000-0003-1299-6127",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1462-2912,1462-2920,NA,NA,NA,AUG,2020,22,8,NA,NA,NA,3357,3374,NA,10.1111/1462-2920.15107,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.15107,NA,20-Jun,NA,NA,NA,NA,32483901,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000543262200001,NA,2840,Both

We quantified the effects of the presence of the common toxic endophyte (CT), two novel endophyte genotypes (AR-542, AR-584), no endophyte (endophyte free, E-), and a mixture of all endophyte statuses (mix) within a single genotype of tall fescue (PDF) on various soil and plant parameters.

20,Both,"Grasses hosting Epichloe endophytes are protected against herbivores due to the production of various fungal alkaloids. Previous research has found that high foliar phosphorus concentrations reduce the level of the alkaloid ergovaline, thereby reducing the endophyte-mediated herbivore resistance. Yet, the impact of phosphorus on ergovaline biosynthesis versus its influence on endophyte growth and synthesis of other fungal alkaloids remains unresolved. Our objective was to elucidate these relationships. We grew endophyte-symbiotic and non-symbiotic Festuca arundinacea plants and fertilised them with different doses of phosphorus. Later, half of the plants from each treatment were challenged with larvae of the generalist chewing insect Spodoptera frugiperda. We assessed the relationships between foliar phosphorus levels, fungal mycelium and alkaloid concentrations, as well as their impacts on larvae performance, herbivore-caused damage and plant biomass.<br /> Endophyte mycelial biomass in plant tissue was found to be independent of foliar phosphorus concentration. The alkaloids lolines and peramine showed a linear relationship with mycelial biomass but no correlation with foliar phosphorus. Surprisingly, high ergovaline concentrations were positively associated with an interaction between endophyte mycelial biomass and foliar phosphorus concentration. Although herbivory increased loline concentration, only high concentrations of ergovaline and peramine were related to reduced S. frugiperda larvae weight gain. However, endophyte presence did not reduce herbivory damage on plants.<br /> Contrary to expectation, we did not find a negative but a positive association between concentrations of foliar phosphorus and ergovaline alkaloid, through its interaction with endophyte mycelial biomass. Alternatively, our findings suggest that phosphorus plays a crucial role in modulating the Epichlo & euml;-mediated defensive mutualism, primarily through its effects on ergovaline rather than on endophyte concentration or production of other alkaloids.","Decunta, FA; Pérez, LI; Graff, P; Gundel, PE",NA,NA,NA,"Decunta, F.

22,Presence,"Wetland soils are defined by anoxic and reducing conditions that impose biogeochemically hostile conditions on plant roots and their endogenous fungal communities. The cosmopolitan wetland plant Typha L. mitigates root-zone anoxia efficiently, such that roots of these plants may constitute fungal habitats similar to roots in subaerially exposed soils. Alternatively, fungi may compete with plant cells for limited oxygen in inundated roots. We hypothesized that extrinsic environmental factors may reduce fungal incidence and affect fungal community structure within inundated roots as compared with those in subaerially exposed soils. We sampled roots of Typha spp. plants across inundation gradients in constructed reservoirs; root subsamples were microscopically examined for fungal structures, and morphologically distinct fungal endophytes were cultured and isolated from surface-sterilized subsamples. We found that the incidence of fungal hyphae was suppressed for all types of vegetative mycelia when roots were inundated, regardless of depth, but that there were no obvious differences in community composition of fungi cultured from roots growing in inundated versus subaerially exposed soils. This suggests that the suppression of hyphae we observed in root samples did not result from changes in community composition. Instead, low hyphal incidence in inundated Typha roots may reflect germinal inhibition or unsuccessful initial colonization, possibly owing to plant-mediated redox dynamism in the surrounding soil. No variation was seen in the incidence of asexual spores, or chytridiomycetes, nor were there significant differences between geographically disparate sampling sites. Communities of root-endogenous fungi may therefore be influenced more strongly by external environmental factors than by the environments that plant roots comprise.","Klymiuk, AA; Sikes, BA",NA,NA,NA,"Klymiuk, Ashley A.; Sikes, Benjamin A.",NA,Suppression of root-endogenous fungi in persistently inundated <i>Typha</i> roots,MYCOLOGIA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sikes, Benjamin/G-8895-2018","Klymiuk, Ashley/0000-0003-1758-8720; Sikes, Benjamin/0000-0003-0774-2624",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0027-5514,1557-2536,NA,NA,NA,3-Sep,2019,111,5,NA,NA,NA,748,757,NA,10.1080/00275514.2019.1635388,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00275514.2019.1635388,NA,19-Aug,NA,NA,NA,NA,31390954,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000480852200001,NA,9453,Both

We studied whether the associations between Bromus auleticus and their endophytes, Neotyphodium pampeanum and Neotyphodium tembladerae, are beneficial for this wild forage grass native to South America. In a greenhouse experiment, 3-month-old endophyte-infected plants (E+) showed enhanced growth relative to their endophyte-free counterparts (E-). In a one-year-long experiment in the field, E+ plants showed higher survival and regrowth rate, and produced more biomass and seeds than E- plants. Only with respect to the seed output did N.similar to tembladerae seem to be detrimental, whereas N.similar to pampeanum did not affect this parameter. No differences were observed with respect to the germination of seeds produced by E+ or E- plants. Loline alkaloids were detected in N.similar to pampeanum-infected plants.

24,Both,"Plants infected with vertically transmitted fungal endophytes carry their microbial symbionts with them during dispersal into new areas. Yet, whether seed-borne endophytes enhance the host plant's ability to overcome colonisation barriers and to regenerate within invaded sites remains poorly understood. We examined how symbiosis with asexual endophytic fungi (Neotyphodium) affected establishment and seed loss to predators in the invasive annual grass Lolium multiflorum (Italian ryegrass) across contrasting successional plots. Italian ryegrass seeds with high and low endophyte incidence were sown into three communities: a 1-year-old fallow field, a 15-year-old grassland, and a 24-year-old forest, which conformed to an old-field chronosequence in the eastern Inland Pampa, Argentina. We found that endophyte infection consistently increased host population recruitment and reproductive output. Endophyte presence also enhanced aerial biomass production of ryegrass in a low recruitment year but not in a high recruitment year, suggesting that symbiotic effects on growth performance are density dependent. Endophyte presence reduced seed removal by rodents, although differential predation may not account for the increased success of infected grass populations. Overall, there was no statistical evidence for an endophyte-by-site interaction, indicating that the fungal endosymbiont benefitted host establishment regardless of large differences in biotic and abiotic environment among communities. Our results imply that hereditary endophytes may increase the chances for host grass species to pass various ecological filters associated with invasion resistance across a broad range of successional habitats.","Uchitel, A; Omacini, M; Chaneton, EJ",NA,NA,NA,"Uchitel, Andrea; Omacini, Marina; Chaneton, Enrique J.",NA,Inherited fungal symbionts enhance establishment of an invasive annual grass across successional habitats,OECOLOGIA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Omacini, Marina/0000-0003-1460-262X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0029-8549,1432-1939,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2011,165,2,NA,NA,NA,465,475,NA,10.1007/s00442-010-1740-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-010-1740-z,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20686788,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000286224900020,NA,6277,Both

The allelopathic effect of C. stoebe on K. macrantha when infected with the fungal endophyte was more than twice that of endophyte-free C. stoebe. However, this allelopathic effect was a small part of the very large competitive effect of C. stoebe on K. macrantha in all treatments, likely because of the priority effects in our experimental design. To our knowledge, these results are the first experimental evidence for a symbiotic relationship between plants and fungal endophytes affecting allelopathic interactions between competing plants, and thus provide insight into the mechanisms by which fungal endophytes may increase the competitive ability of their hosts.","Aschehoug, ET; Callaway, RM; Newcombe, G; Tharayil, N; Chen, SY",NA,NA,NA,"Aschehoug, Erik T.; Callaway, Ragan M.; Newcombe, George; Tharayil, Nishanth; Chen, Shuyan",NA,Fungal endophyte increases the allelopathic effects of an invasive forb,OECOLOGIA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Newcombe, George/N-1650-2019","Tharayil, Nishanth/0000-0001-6866-0804",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0029-8549,1432-1939,NA,NA,NA,MAY,2014,175,1,NA,NA,NA,285,291,NA,10.1007/s00442-014-2891-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-014-2891-0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24488227,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000334691600026,NA,3149,Both
26,Presence,"Efforts to introduce pathogen resistance into landscape tree species by breeding may have unintended consequences for fungal diversity. To address this issue, we compared the frequency and diversity of endophytic fungi and defensive phenolic metabolites in elm (Ulmus spp.) trees with genotypes known to differ in resistance to Dutch elm disease. Our results indicate that resistant U. minor and U. pumila genotypes exhibit a lower frequency and diversity of fungal endophytes in the xylem than susceptible U. minor genotypes. However, resistant and susceptible genotypes showed a similar frequency and diversity of endophytes in the leaves and bark. The resistant and susceptible genotypes could be discriminated on the basis of the phenolic profile of the xylem, but not on basis of phenolics in the leaves or bark. As the Dutch elm disease pathogen develops within xylem tissues, the defensive chemistry of resistant elm genotypes thus appears to be one of the factors that may limit colonization by both the pathogen and endophytes. We discuss a potential trade-off between the benefits of breeding resistance into tree species, versus concomitant losses of fungal endophytes and the ecosystem services they provide. © 2013 Martín et al.",Martín J.A.; Witzell J.; Blumenstein K.; Rozpedowska E.; Helander M.; Sieber T.N.; Gil L.,NA,,NA,"Martín, Juan A.

27,Presence,"Plants possess a sophisticated hormone-signaling system, which includes salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), to defend themselves from herbivores. In addition, this immune system is modulated by nonpathogenic microbes that live asymptomatically within intercellular spaces of host grasses. We investigated the resistance triggered by defense hormones, and that provided by endophyte Epichloe gansuensis against aphid Rhopalosiphum padi, and how the endophyte regulates this tripartite interaction. We detected that endophyte-induced plant tolerance to the aphid feeding and exogenous SA increased plant shoot biomass, root biomass, plant length, and chlorophyll content. Endophyte colonization induces the WRKY54 factor that overrides negative effects on plant growth and possibly suppresses SA accumulation. In addition, the endophyte promotes a level of JA that is antagonistic to the SA pathway. By disabling the SA mechanism for herbivore-mediated plant growth inhibition, the endophyte induces plant tolerance to herbivory.","He, YL; Chen, TX; Zhang, HJ; White, JF; Li, CJ",NA,NA,NA,"He, Yali; Chen, Taixiang; Zhang, Haijuan; White, James F.; Li, Chunjie",NA,Fungal Endophytes Help Grasses to Tolerate Sap-Sucking Herbivores Through a Hormone-Signaling System,JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"White, James/C-2280-2009; Li, Chunjie/G-4988-2012","Li, Chunjie/0000-0002-3287-2140",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0721-7595,1435-8107,NA,NA,NA,AUG,2022,41,6,NA,NA,NA,2122,2137,NA,10.1007/s00344-021-10430-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-021-10430-2,NA,21-Jul,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000668816900003,NA,6294,Both
28,Both,"Microbial plant symbionts have been suggested to mediate plant-soil feedback and affect ecosystem functions. Systemic EpichloA << fungal endophytes of grasses are found to mediate litter decomposition. These effects are often linked to alkaloids produced by EpichloA << species, which are hypothesized to negatively affect decomposers. Although endophytes have been found to affect plant community and soil biota, direct (through litter quality) and indirect (through the environment) effects of fungal endophytes on litter decomposition have been scarcely scrutinized. We placed litterbags with endophyte-symbiotic (E+) and non-symbiotic (E-) Schedonorus pratensis plant litter in plots dominated by E+ or E- plants of the same species, and followed the dynamics of mass losses over time. We predicted the endophyte would hinder decomposition through changes in litter quality and that both types of litter would decompose faster in home environments. E+ litter decomposed faster in both environments. The mean difference between decomposition rate of E+ and E- litter tended to be higher in E- plots. Nitrogen and phosphorus, two elements usually associated with high decomposition rates, were significantly lower in E+ litter. We also detected a higher proportion of C in the cellulose form in E+ litter. Contrary to the general assumption, we found that symbiosis with EpichloA << fungal endophytes can be associated with higher decomposition of plant litter. Since direct effects of EpichloA << fungi were still stronger than indirect effects, it is suggested that besides the alkaloids, other changes in plant biomass would explain in a context-dependent manner, the endophyte effects on the litter decomposition.","Gundel, PE; Helander, M; Garibaldi, LA; Vázquez-De-Aldana, BR; Zabalgogeazcoa, I; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, P.

29,Both,"Endophytic fungal symbionts of grasses are well known for their protective benefit of herbivory reduction. However, the majority of studies on endophyte-grass symbioses have been conducted on economically important, agricultural species-particularly tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne)-raising the hypothesis that strong benefits are the product of artificial selection. We examined whether fungal endophytes found in natural populations of native grass species deterred insect herbivores. By testing several native grass-endophyte symbiota, we examined phylogenetic signals in the effects of endophytes on insects and compared the relative importance of herbivore and symbiotum identity in the outcome of the interactions. Preference was assessed using three herbivore species [Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera), Schistocerca americana (Orthoptera), Rhopalosiphum padi (Hemiptera)] and ten native symbiota, which spanned seven grass genera. We also assessed herbivore performance in a no choice experiment for five native symbiota against S. frugiperda. We compared greenhouse and laboratory trials with natural levels of herbivory measured in experimental field populations. In all cases, we included the agronomic grass species, L. arundinaceum, to compare with results from the native grasses. Both in the field and in experimental trials, herbivores showed a significant preference for endophyte-free plant material for the majority of native grasses, with up to three times lower herbivory for endophyte-symbiotic plants; however, the degree of response depended on the identity of the herbivore species.

In contrast, the endophyte in L. arundinaceum had few significant anti-herbivore effects, except for a reduction in herbivory at one of two field sites.

30,Presence,"ContextLand use change can significantly affect plant-fungal interactions.ObjectivesWe assessed how fungal endophytes within African wild olive (Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata) twigs are influenced by different levels of land use change and differences in surrounding vegetation types.MethodsTwigs were sampled in the Western Cape Province (South Africa) and their fungal endophyte assemblages were characterised using culture-independent DNA metabarcoding. We assessed the effects of land use change (natural, semi-natural and planted (completely transformed)) and differences in surrounding vegetation types (grasses/low-growing plants versus shrubs/trees versus other olives) using fungal endophyte alpha and beta diversity measures. Co-occurrence networks were constructed to assess assemblage connectivity under different scenarios and to identify OTUs of potential ecological significance.ResultsOTU richness, but not abundance, was significantly influenced by both land use change and differences in the surrounding vegetation types. Planted African olives and those surrounded by heterospecific trees harboured the highest OTU richness. Only levels of land use change significantly influenced fungal endophyte assemblage composition. Specifically, fungal assemblages from natural habitats were distinct from those in planted and semi-natural habitats, which were similar to each other. Co-occurrence network analyses revealed that cohesive and species rich networks could only be maintained within the natural habitats.ConclusionThese findings suggest that although the African olive is widespread, the identity and composition of their associated fungal assemblages are particularly sensitive to land use change. This study highlights the importance of conserving natural habitats, not just for the plants, but also for the maintenance of their associated fungal endophytes.","Ngubane, NP; Dreyer, LL; Slippers, B; Kemler, M; Witfeld, F; Begerow, D; Brachmann, A; Roets, F",NA,NA,NA,"Ngubane, Nombuso P.; Dreyer, Leanne L.; Slippers, Bernard; Kemler, Martin; Witfeld, Frederick; Begerow, Dominik; Brachmann, Andreas; Roets, Francois",NA,Land use change rather than surrounding vegetation affects fungal endophyte assemblages in the African wild olive,LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kemler, Martin/GSD-6740-2022; Brachmann, Andreas/I-2241-2013; Slippers, Bernard/IUP-9822-2023; Ngubane, PhD, Nombuso/GZK-6896-2022; Roets, Francois/HMP-4294-2023; Slippers, Bernard/A-9351-2008","Ngubane, Nombuso/0000-0002-0910-2623; Slippers, Bernard/0000-0003-1491-3858",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0921-2973,1572-9761,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2023,38,12,NA,NA,NA,3153,3171,NA,10.1007/s10980-023-01772-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-023-01772-1,NA,23-Sep,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001070340100001,NA,1893,Both
31,Presence,"Horse chestnut trees (Aesculus hippocastanum L.) are stable and important elements of urban and rural landscapes. So far most studies that have investigated horse chestnut trees have observed their above ground characteristics, whereas the roots structure and symbiotic associations with mycorrhizal arbuscular fungi have been poorly recognized. Therefore, our objective was to perform a detailed study of horse chestnut fine roots and the extent of their colonization by mycorrhizal fungi in urban and rural environments. In the urban area two different study sites were selected: one in the street and the second in city parks. Two rural sites comprised the roadside verges planted with horse chestnut trees in open countryside. The chemical composition of soils revealed significant differences between study sites. The biometric parameters of fine roots are only partly related to soil characteristics. The results revealed a lack of a clear negative effect of the urban environment on fine root parameters, which may suggest a high degree of plasticity in this species in response to heterogeneity of the soil. At all study sites the fine roots of horse chestnut were colonized by arbuscular fungi (AM) and fungal endophytes. Trees from all study sites revealed a similar range of AM colonization. Significant differences were found only between one rural and one urban park site. The results from urban and rural sites revealed horse chestnut as a tree species well adapted to both rural and urban conditions and presented well-established mycorrhizal symbiosis with arbuscular fungi.

32,Other,"We report the occurrence of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens in vanilla orchids (Vanilla phaeantha) and cultivated hybrid vanilla (V. planifolia x V. pompona) as a systemic bacterial endophyte. We determined with light microscopy and isolations that tissues of V. phaeantha and the cultivated hybrid were infected by a bacterial endophyte and that shoot meristems and stomatal areas of stems and leaves were densely colonized. We identified the endophyte as B. amyloliquefaciens using DNA sequence data. Since additional endophyte-free plants and seed of this orchid were not available, additional studies were performed on surrogate hosts Amaranthus caudatus, Ipomoea tricolor, and I. purpurea. Plants of A. caudatus inoculated with B. amyloliquefaciens demonstrated intracellular colonization of guard cells and other epidermal cells, confirming the pattern observed in the orchids. Isolations and histological studies suggest that the bacterium may penetrate deeply into developing plant tissues in shoot meristems, forming endospores in maturing tissues. B. amyloliquefaciens produced fungal inhibitors in culture. In controlled experiments using morning glory seedlings we showed that the bacterium promoted seedling growth and reduced seedling necrosis due to pathogens. We detected the gene for phosphopantetheinyl transferase (sfp), an enzyme in the pathway for production of antifungal lipopeptides, and purified the lipopeptide surfactin from cultures of the bacterium. We hypothesize that B. amyloliquefaciens is a robust endophyte and defensive mutualist of vanilla orchids. Whether the symbiosis between this bacterium and its hosts can be managed to protect vanilla crops from diseases is a question that should be evaluated in future research. Microsc. Res.

33,Both,"A symbiosis between grasses and systemic fungal endophytes exists in both natural and agricultural grassland communities. Our objective was to examine the effects of systemic endophytes on the competitive ability of two agronomically important grass species: meadow fescue [Festuca pratensis (Huds.) syn. Schedonorus pratensis (Huds.) P. Beauv] and tall fescue [Festuca arundinacea (Schreb.) syn. Schedonorus phoenix (Scop.)]. Plants of meadow and tall fescue were grown for 48days in replacement series of interspecific mixture with a legume (red clover, Trifolium pratense L.) in different nutrient environments in a greenhouse. Neither of the grass species gained endophyte-promoted competitive advantage over red clover in grass-clover mixtures. Endophyte infection increased the growth of meadow fescue monocultures by 89% compared to endophyte-free monocultures in high-nutrient soils, but plant competition or the cost of endophyte infection to the meadow fescue decreased the yield in resource-limited conditions. On average, endophyte-infected and endophyte-free meadow fescues produced 015 and 017g, and 014 and 014g dry biomass per plant in mixtures with red clover in high- and low-nutrient soils respectively. In contrast to meadow fescue, endophyte-promoted growth of tall fescue monocultures was not detected. Endophyte-infected and endophyte-free tall fescue monocultures produced 076 and 095g biomass per pot, respectively, in the high-nutrient environment.

34,Presence,"Global climate change is increasing pest and pathogen pressures on plant communities, deteriorating optimal plant functioning. In plant communities, root functional trait expression and microbial communities are important indicators of plant functioning belowground, and, when confronted with pathogens aboveground, can simultaneously reflect plant defence strategies. Yet, while research is continuing to emerge on the response of root functional traits and microbial processes to pathogens aboveground, little work has investigated these interactions in tree-crops, or the role organic amendments play in moderating these relationships. The main objective of this study is to disentangle the dynamic effects of pathogens and amendments on root functional traits (i.e. specific root length and area, root diameter, root length density, root nitrogen and root carbon to nitrogen ratio) and root endophytic fungal communities. As a model, we use Coffea arabica (coffee) variety Caturra along a gradient of coffee leaf rust - a foliar disease prominent in coffee systems - under contrasting but widespread amendment regimes in biodiverse agroforestry systems. We found that root trait expression varies along established conservation and collaboration gradients, where fungal endophyte community composition varies significantly as a function of root traits. Belowground resource acquisition strategies do not change with foliar disease incidence, suggesting they may be decoupled. Rather, amendment regimes differentially shape root trait expression and microbial communities, where coffee plants under organic amendments, regardless of foliar disease incidence, expressed greater acquisitive traits and enhanced collaboration with symbiotic fungi. This is an important first step in disentangling the dynamic inter-relationships between plant traits, endophytes and pathogens, generating new questions on the role of amendments in sustainable pathogen management in biodiverse agroecosystems.","Gagliardi, S; Avelino, J; Fulthorpe, R; Virginio, ED; Isaac, ME",NA,NA,NA,"Gagliardi, Stephanie; Avelino, Jacques; Fulthorpe, Roberta; Virginio Filho, Elias de Melo; Isaac, Marney E.",NA,No evidence of foliar disease impact on crop root functional strategies and soil microbial communities: what does this mean for organic coffee?,OIKOS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gagliardi, Stephanie/ABE-9174-2021; Avelino, Jacques/C-5624-2009","Gagliardi, Stephanie/0000-0003-1612-0173; Avelino, Jacques/0000-0003-1983-9431",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0030-1299,1600-0706,NA,NA,NA,JAN,2023,2023,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1111/oik.08987,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.08987,NA,22-Feb,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000754562000001,NA,4044,Both

Although not adapted to salt or drought stress, two commercial rice varieties achieved tolerance to these stresses by colonizing them with Class 2 fungal endophytes isolated from plants growing across moisture and salinity gradients. Plant growth and development, water usage, ROS sensitivity and osmolytes were measured with and without stress under controlled conditions. The endophytes conferred salt, drought and cold tolerance to growth chamber and greenhouse grown plants. Endophytes reduced water consumption by 20-30% and increased growth rate, reproductive yield, and biomass of greenhouse grown plants. In the absence of stress, there was no apparent cost of the endophytes to plants, however, endophyte colonization decreased from 100% at planting to 65% compared to greenhouse plants grown under continual stress (maintained 100% colonization). These findings indicate that rice plants can exhibit enhanced stress tolerance via symbiosis with Class 2 endophytes, and suggest that symbiotic technology may be useful in mitigating impacts of climate change on other crops and expanding agricultural production onto marginal lands.","Redman, RS; Kim, YO; Woodward, CJDA; Greer, C; Espino, L; Doty, SL; Rodriguez, RJ",NA,NA,NA,"Redman, Regina S.; Kim, Yong Ok; Woodward, Claire J.

How the specialization of guilds of organisms varies along environmental gradients underpins popular theories of biogeography and macroecology, whereas the degree of specialization of a species is typically considered fixed. However, the extent to which environmental context impacts specialization dynamics is seldom examined empirically. In this study, we examine how specialization within a bipartite network consisting of three co-occurring plant species and their foliar fungal endophyte symbionts changes along a 1000-meter elevation gradient where host species were held constant. The gradient, along the slope of Mauna Loa shield volcano, represents almost the entire elevational range of two of the three plants. Network and plant specialization values displayed a parabolic relationship with elevation, and were highest at middle elevations, whereas bipartite associations were least specific at low and high elevations. Shannon's diversity of fungal endophytes correlated negatively with specificity, and was highest at the ends of the transects. Although plant host was a strong determinant of fungal community composition within sites, fungal species turnover was high among sites. There was no evidence of spatial or elevational patterning in fungal community compositon.

39,Presence,"Plant-associated microbes, specifically fungal endophytes, augment the ability of many grasses to adapt to extreme environmental conditions. Tripsacum dactyloides (Eastern gamagrass) is a perennial, drought-tolerant grass native to the tallgrass prairies of the central USA. The extent to which the microbiome of T. dactyloides contributes to its drought tolerance is unknown. Ninety-seven genotypes of T. dactyloides were collected from native populations across an east-west precipitation gradient in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, and then grown together in a common garden for over 20 years. Root and leaf samples were visually examined for fungal density. Because fungal endophytes confer drought-tolerant capabilities to their host plants, we expected to find higher densities of fungal endophytes in plants from western, drier regions, compared to plants from eastern, wetter regions. Results confirmed a negative correlation between endophyte densities in roots and precipitation at the genotype's original location (r = -0.21 P = 0.04). Our analyses reveal that the host genotype's origin along the precipitation gradient predicts the absolute abundance of symbionts in the root, but not the relative abundances of particular organisms or the overall community composition. Overall, these results demonstrate that genetic variation for plant-microbe interactions can reflect historical environment, and reinforce the importance of considering plant genotype in conservation and restoration work in tallgrass prairie ecosystems. Individuals of Tripsacum dactyloides (Eastern Gamagrass), a tallgrass prairie native, collected across the central USA retain distinct genotypic and local adaptation patterns long after transplanting into a single garden with a common environment. We found individuals of T. dactyloides originally from drier areas had higher densities of fungal endophytes in their roots. This demonstrates that plants are able to selectively recruit microbes from their immediate environment in a way that reflects their historic environment due to the plant's genetics.

These results indicate that Epichloe acts as a key species within Ammophila, changing richness and composition of the root mycobiome and integrating above- and belowground mycobiome interactions. Further, effects of Epichloe on root endophyte communities were enhanced by N addition, indicating that this fungal species may become even more important in future environments.","Garces, KR; Sage, HE; Christian, N; Emery, SM",NA,NA,NA,"Garces, Kylea R.; Sage, Haley E.; Christian, Natalie; Emery, Sarah M.",NA,<i>Epichloe</i> Increases Root Fungal Endophyte Richness and Alters Root Fungal Endophyte Composition in a Changing World,JOURNAL OF FUNGI,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Emery, Sarah/AFR-1495-2022","Emery, Sarah/0000-0003-2496-6152; Garces, Kylea/0000-0002-4045-9786",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2309-608X,NA,NA,NA,NOV,2022,8,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3390/jof8111142,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof8111142,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36354909,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000881116500001,NA,6249,Both
41,Both,"Interactions among plants may be influenced by pests or parasites that differentially affect one competitor. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of fungal parasitism and insect herbivory, alone and in concert, on plant competitive interactions. The effects of fungal endophyte (Acremonium spp.) infection and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) herbivory on competitive interactions in one- and two-species mixtures of the grasses tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), red fescue (F. rubra), and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) were examined in greenhouse experiments. In general, herbivory reduced plant biomass whereas endophyte infection increased plant biomass. Endophyte-infected (E+) plants were less damaged by herbivory than uninfected (E-) plants of the same species. Studies on fall armyworm larval feeding and choice tests with the five grass species were generally consistent with the outcome of the competition experiments; E+ plants were less nutritious and less preferred than E- plants of the same species. There were significant interactions among factors so that the outcome of competition depended on the species identities and the presence or absence of endophytes and herbivores. In competition with Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), E+ and E- perennial ryegrass produced similar biomass in the absence of herbivory, but E+ perennial ryegrass had nearly twice the biomass of E- plants when herbivores were present. E+ and E- tall fescue were poor competitors with orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata) when herbivores were absent, but E+ tall fescue was a better competitor than E- plants and orchard grass when herbivores were present. This study indicates that competitive hierarchies among grasses are altered by interactions with insect herbivores and fungal endophytes, which have typically been ignored in past studies.","CLAY, K; MARKS, S; CHEPLICK, GP",NA,NA,NA,"CLAY, K; MARKS, S; CHEPLICK, GP",NA,EFFECTS OF INSECT HERBIVORY AND FUNGAL ENDOPHYTE INFECTION ON COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS AMONG GRASSES,ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Clay, Keith/C-8730-2012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0012-9658,NA,NA,NA,NA,SEP,1993,74,6,NA,NA,NA,1767,1777,NA,10.2307/1939935,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1939935,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1993LV24200017,NA,4657,Both
42,Review,"Plant tissues host a variety of fungi. One important group is the dark septate endophytes (DSEs) that colonize plant roots and form characteristic intracellular structures melanized hyphae and microsclerotia. The DSE associations are common and frequently observed in various biomes and plant taxa. Reviews suggest that the proportion of plant species colonized by DSE equal that colonized by AM and microscopic studies show that the proportion of the root system colonized by fungi DSE can equal, or even exceed, the colonization by AM fungi. Despite the high frequency and suspected ecological importance, the effects of DSE colonization on plant growth and performance have remained unclear. Here, we draw from over a decade of experimentation with the obscure DSE symbiosis and synthesize across large bodies of published and unpublished data from Arabidopsis thaliana and Allium porrum model systems as well as from experiments that use native plants to better resolve the host responses to DSE colonization. The data indicate similar distribution of host responses in model and native plant studies, validating the use of model plants for tractable dissection of DSE symbioses. The available data also permit empirical testing of the environmental modulation of host responses to DSE colonization and refining the ""mutualism-parasitism-continuum"" paradigm for DSE symbioses. These data highlight the context dependency of the DSE symbioses: not only plant species but also ecotypes vary in their responses to populations of conspecific DSE fungi environmental conditions further shift the host responses similar to those predicted based on the mutualism-parasitism-continuum paradigm. The model systems provide several established avenues of inquiry that permit more detailed molecular and functional dissection of fungal endophyte symbioses, identifying thus likely mechanisms that may underlie the observed host responses to endophyte colonization.","Mandyam, KG; Jumpponen, A",NA,NA,NA,"Mandyam, Keerthi G.; Jumpponen, Ari",NA,Mutualism-parasitism paradigm synthesized from results of root-endophyte models,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-302X,NA,NA,NA,12-Jan,2015,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3389/fmicb.2014.00776,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00776,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25628615,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000348724100002,NA,6142,Both
43,Presence,"Fungal endophytes have been documented in almost all terrestrial plant groups. Although the endophyte infection syndrome in agronomic cultivars is well studied, relatively little work addresses questions of spatial ecology and fire effects on epichloae endophyte infection in native grasses, and none, to our knowledge, in sub-Saharan Africa. We sampled seven populations of the native Festuca costata Nees along the spline of the Drakensberg range in South Africa at several spatial scales, including both recently burned and unburned stands. We tested epichloae presence and prevalence with immunoblot assays, PCR and genetic sequencing. We found epichloae endophytes were present and prevalent (38-98% infection rates depending on location). Variation in infection rates occurred primarily among locations, but also among bunches. There was little evidence that endophyte infection rates varied with fire. Novel evidence of epichloae infection of a native Festuca in South Africa opens the door to several new research questions, from the phylogenetic relationship between epichloae of sub-Saharan Africa and other continents to the ecological advantages or disadvantages that endophytes confer upon their hosts, especially in a fire-prone ecosystem vulnerable to global environmental change.","McGranahan, DA; Burgdorf, R; Kirkman, KP",NA,NA,NA,"McGranahan, D.

44,Presence,"Plant-associated fungal communities play a vital role in plant adaptations, physiological functions, and productivity. Therefore, it is important to reveal the mechanisms driving the assembly of these communities. Yet it is still not fully understood how community assembly and structure differentiate in plant compartments, growth seasons, and varieties at large geographic distances. In this study, we analyzed bulk soil and plant-associated fungal communities of five wheat varieties across two growth stages in three biogeographic sites with distances of about 324, 534, or 800 km apart between any two locations. Our results indicated that the fungal community varied primarily across the sample types (leaf endosphere, root endosphere, rhizosphere, and bulk soil), followed by growth stage. Compared with the regreening stage, lower alpha-diversity and more dominance by abundant species in the fungal community were observed in wheat-associated compartments (four sample types except for bulk soil) at the heading stage. Additionally, within each wheat-associated compartment across every growth stage, location had stronger effects on fungal community assembly than the wheat variety. The effects of variety on fungal community assembly were location specific as were the growth-stage patterns of varietal effects on leaf endosphere and rhizosphere fungal communities. We further detected a less diverse but abundant core fungal taxa that could be grouped into three clusters associated mainly with location. This study characterized the interplay effects between plant selection (compartment, growth stage, variety) and environment (location) on wheat-associated mycobiomes by determining drivers of fungal community assembly and core fungal taxa in field conditions.","Zheng, YY; Li, XZ; Cao, HL; Lei, L; Zhang, X; Han, DJ; Wang, JM; Yao, MJ",NA,NA,NA,"Zheng, Yuyin; Li, Xiangzhen; Cao, Huili; Lei, Li; Zhang, Xue; Han, Dejun; Wang, Junming; Yao, Minjie",NA,The assembly of wheat-associated fungal community differs across growth stages,APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wang, Junming/AAD-9636-2019","Li, xiangzhen/0000-0001-6499-0179; Yao, Minjie/0000-0001-7501-0519",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0175-7598,1432-0614,NA,NA,NA,OCT,2021,105,19,NA,NA,NA,7427,7438,NA,10.1007/s00253-021-11550-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-021-11550-1,NA,21-Sep,NA,NA,NA,NA,34505913,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000694774600001,NA,6150,Both
45,Presence,"Fungal endophytes modify plant-herbivore interactions by producing toxic alkaloids that deter herbivory. However, studies have neglected the direct effects herbivores may have on endophytes. Antifungal properties and signalling effectors in herbivore saliva suggest that evolutionary pressures may select for animals that mitigate the effects of endophyte-produced alkaloids. Here, we tested whether saliva of moose (Alces alces) and European reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) reduced hyphal elongation and production of ergot alkaloids by the foliar endophyte Epichloefestucae associated with the globally distributed red fescue Festuca rubra. Both moose and reindeer saliva reduced the growth of isolated endophyte hyphae when compared with a treatment of distilled water. Induction of the highly toxic alkaloid ergovaline was also inhibited in plants from the core of F. rubra's distribution when treated with moose saliva following simulated grazing. In genotypes from the southern limit of the species' distribution, ergovaline was constitutively expressed, as predicted where growth is environmentally limited.

1,Presence,"Every plant species examined to date harbors endophytic fungi within its asymptomatic aerial tissues, such that endophytes represent a ubiquitous, yet cryptic, component of terrestrial plant communities. Fungal endophytes associated with leaves of woody angiosperms are especially diverse; yet, fundamental aspects of their interactions with hosts are unknown. In contrast to the relatively species-poor endophytes that are vertically transmitted and act as defensive mutualists of some temperate grasses, the diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angiosperms are thought to contribute little to host defense. Here, we document high diversity, spatial structure, and host affinity among foliar endophytes associated with a tropical tree (Theobroma cacao, Malvaceae) across lowland Panama. We then show that inoculation of endophyte-free leaves with endophytes isolated frequently from naturally infected, asymptomatic hosts significantly decreases both leaf necrosis and leaf mortality when T. cacao seedlings are challenged with a major pathogen (Phytophthora sp.). In contrast to reports of fungal inoculation inducing systemic defense, we found that protection was primarily localized to endophyte-infected tissues. Further, endophyte-mediated protection was greater in mature leaves, which bear less intrinsic defense against fungal pathogens than do young leaves. In vitro studies suggest that host affinity is mediated by leaf chemistry, and that protection may be mediated by direct interactions of endophytes with foliar pathogens. Together, these data demonstrate the capacity of diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angiosperms to play an important but previously unappreciated role in host defense.","Arnold, AE; Mejía, LC; Kyllo, D; Rojas, EI; Maynard, Z; Robbins, N; Herre, EA",NA,NA,NA,"Arnold, AE; Mejía, LC; Kyllo, D; Rojas, EI; Maynard, Z; Robbins, N; Herre, EA",NA,Fungal endophytes limit pathogen damage in a tropical tree,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mejia, Luis/KFR-7315-2024","Mejia, Luis/0000-0003-2135-5241",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0027-8424,1091-6490,NA,NA,NA,23-Dec,2003,100,26,NA,NA,NA,15649,15654,NA,10.1073/pnas.2533483100,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2533483100,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,14671327,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000187554600066,NA,3287,Both

3,Presence,"Key requirements for microbes to initiate and establish mutualistic symbiotic interactions with plants are evasion of potential host defense responses and strict control of microbial growth. Reactive oxygen species ( ROS) produced by a specific NADPH oxidase isoform, NoxA, regulate hyphal growth in the mutualistic interaction between the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae and its grass host Lolium perenne. Unlike mammalian systems, little is known about the fungal NADPH oxidase complex and its response to differentiation signals. We identify an E. festucae p(67phox)- like regulator, NoxR, dispensable in culture but essential in planta for the symbiotic interaction. Plants infected with a noxR deletion mutant show severe stunting and premature senescence, whereas hyphae in the meristematic tissues show increased branching leading to increased fungal colonization of pseudostem and leaf blade tissue. Inhibition of ROS production or overexpression of noxR recapitulates the hyperbranching phenotype in culture. NoxR interacts in vitro with the small GTP binding protein RacA and requires a functional RacA binding site to complement the noxR mutant and restore the wild- type plant interaction phenotype. These results show that NoxR is a key regulator of NoxA in symbiosis, where it acts together with RacA to spatially regulate ROS production and control hyphal branching and patterning.","Takemoto, D; Tanaka, A; Scott, B",NA,NA,NA,"Takemoto, Daigo; Tanaka, Aiko; Scott, Barry",NA,A p67<SUP>Phox</SUP>-like regulator is recruited to control hyphal branching in a fungal-grass mutualistic symbiosis,PLANT CELL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tanaka, Aiko/ABG-8351-2020; Scott, David/J-3135-2013","Takemoto, Daigo/0000-0002-9816-7882",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1040-4651,NA,NA,NA,NA,OCT,2006,18,10,NA,NA,NA,2807,2821,NA,10.1105/tpc.106.046169,http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.106.046169,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,17041146,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000241818300029,NA,4781,Absence
4,Other,"Beneficial plant-associated microorganisms, such as fungal endophytes, are key partners that normally improve plant survival under different environmental stresses. It has been shown that microorganisms from extreme environments, like those associated with the roots of Antarctica plants, can be good partners to increase the performance of crop plants and to restore endangered native plants. Nothofagus alessandrii and N. glauca, are among the most endangered species of Chile, restricted to a narrow and/or limited distributional range associated mainly to the Maulino forest in Chile. Here we evaluated the effect of the inoculation with a fungal consortium of root endophytes isolated from the Antarctic host plant Colobanthus quitensis on the ecophysiological performance [photosynthesis, water use efficiency (WUE), and growth] of both endangered tree species. We also, tested how Antarctic root-fungal endophytes could affect the potential distribution of N. alessandrii through niche modeling. Additionally, we conducted a transplant experiment recording plant survival on 2 years in order to validate the model. Lastly, to evaluate if inoculation with Antarctic endophytes has negative impacts on native soil microorganisms, we compared the biodiversity of fungi and bacterial in the rhizospheric soil of transplanted individuals of N. alessandrii inoculated and non-inoculated with fungal endophytes. We found that inoculation with root-endophytes produced significant increases in N. alessandrii and N. glauca photosynthetic rates, water use efficiencies and cumulative growth. In N. alessandrii, seedling survival was significantly greater on inoculated plants compared with non-inoculated individuals. For this species, a spatial distribution modeling revealed that, inoculation with root-fungal endophytes could potentially increase the current distributional range by almost threefold. Inoculation with root-fungal endophytes, did not reduce native rhizospheric microbiome diversity. Our results suggest that the studied consortium of Antarctic root-fungal endophytes improve the ecophysiological performance as well as the survival of inoculated trees and can be used as a biotechnological tool for the restoration of endangered tree species.","Torres-Díaz, C; Valladares, MA; Acuña-Rodríguez, IS; Ballesteros, GI; Barrera, A; Atala, C; Molina-Montenegro, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Torres-Diaz, Cristian; Valladares, Moises A.; Acuna-Rodriguez, Ian S.; Ballesteros, Gabriel I.; Barrera, Andrea; Atala, Cristian; Molina-Montenegro, Marco A.",NA,Symbiotic Interaction Enhances the Recovery of Endangered Tree Species in the Fragmented Maulino Forest,FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ballesteros, Gabriel/IAN-7082-2023; Valladares, Moisés/Q-5088-2019; Valladares, Moises A./N-1152-2017","Torres Diaz, Cristian/0000-0002-5741-5288; Valladares, Moises A./0000-0002-0294-174X; Atala, Cristian/0000-0003-1337-9534",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-462X,NA,NA,NA,NA,15-Apr,2021,12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3389/fpls.2021.663017,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.663017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33936153,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000645024100001,NA,1425,Both

6,Review,"The fabaceae are rooted in rosaceae pods known as ""vegetables"" by the early botanists. They are the third family of angiosperms which includes 642 genus divided into about 18,000 species. The fabaceae family is known as the most important family of the ecosystem as it is indispensable in medicine, agriculture, industry and livestock. The Adenocarpus genus has about 50 species that are frequently found in tropical regions of Northern Africa, the southern part of West Europe and in the central and southern Italy. They are used in traditional medicine for the treatment of several diseases: such as microbial infections, leprosy, scabies, acne, malaria and other plants species are used in agriculture as insecticidal properties. Mainly Adenocarpus mannii species is well represented in the tropical regions of North Africa. It occurs in Angola, Mozambique, Malawi, Guinea, South Africa, Tanzania, and Burundi. In Cameroon, it is encountered in South West Region and West Region. Previous phytochemical studies led to the isolation of several classes of compounds such as flavonoids, alkaloids and triterpenes. Several studies report the phytochemical studies on genus Adenocarpus and chemotaxonomic markers of species of this genus. Herein, we outline all the botanical, pharmacological and phytochemical aspects of Adenocarpus mannii.

7,Presence,"Wilting of sweet pepper plants is leading to significant yield losses in organic cultivation in glasshouses in the Netherlands. Verticillium dahliae was consistently isolated from affected plants and is known to cause wilting of plants. While sampling sweet pepper plants, root discoloration and damage of the root cortex were observed. Colletotrichum coccodes was isolated from affected roots. To study the co-occurrence and interaction of both pathogens, sweet pepper plants with, and without wilting symptoms were collected from the glasshouse. V. dahliae was only isolated from plants with wilting symptoms, while C. coccodes was also found on symptomless plants. Single or combined inoculations with V. dahliae and C. coccodes were performed on pepper seedlings to study the pathogenicity and the interaction of both pathogens. Symptom development was evaluated and fungal colonization was measured in the roots and stem with real-time PCR. V. dahliae induced stunted growth, while C. coccodes did not induce symptoms on the shoot. C. coccodes reduced root weight when plants grew under suboptimal conditions but under optimal conditions for plant growth, C. coccodes reduced V. dahliae colonization and symptom development. In conclusion, V. dahliae is the causal agent of wilting of pepper plants and C. coccodes is a weak pathogen, with antagonistic or neutral effects on symptom development and colonization by V. dahliae.

8,Presence,"Lycoris radiata is the main source of galanthamine, a clinical drug used in Alzheimer's disease; however, the galanthamine content in L. radiata is low. Lycoris aurea is another Lycoris species with high galanthamine content. Fungal endophytes can enhance plant secondary metabolite accumulation; thus, we compared the fungal communities in these two Lycoris species to identify certain fungal taxa in L. aurea capable of enhancing galanthamine accumulation. Several fungal endophytes, which were enriched in, exclusively isolated from L. aurea, or showed significant correlations with galanthamine, were demonstrated to enhance the accumulation of only galanthamine but no other Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (AAs) in L. radiata. These fungal endophytes mainly upregulated the downstream genes in the biosynthesis pathways of AAs in L. radiata, suggesting that they may allocate more precursors for galanthamine biosynthesis. This study demonstrated that fungal endophytes from L. aurea with higher galanthamine content can specifically enhance the accumulation of this medicinal alkaloid in other Lycoris species, thereby increasing the galanthamine source and reducing galanthamine separation and purification costs. This study broadens our understanding of the complex interactions between plant secondary metabolites and fungal endophytes.","Wang, ZY; Yuan, J; Wang, R; Xu, S; Zhou, JY",NA,NA,NA,"Wang, Ziying; Yuan, Jie; Wang, Ren; Xu, Sheng; Zhou, Jiayu",NA,Distinct fungal communities affecting opposite galanthamine accumulation patterns in two<i> Lycoris</i> species,MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0944-5013,1618-0623,NA,NA,NA,SEP,2024,286,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1016/j.micres.2024.127791,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2024.127791,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38851007,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001347801500001,NA,4913,Both

10,Presence,"Endophytes play an important role in ecological and evolutionary processes in plants and have marked economic value. Seed-transmitted fungal endophytes are conventionally regarded as mutualistic symbionts, but their fitness consequences for the offspring of the host are not clear. Puccinellia distans infected with the fungus Epichloe typhina (E+) produces seeds that are several times smaller than normal (E). This observation suggests that the E+ seedlings face a developmental disadvantage. Our growth chamber experiments compared the germination rates of the small E+ and large E seeds of P.distans and examined the biomass allocation of seedlings to roots and shoots. The E+ seedlings germinated more slowly and maintained shorter shoots and a smaller root biomass for 3050days after sowing. Despite this disadvantage, the E+ plants more quickly increased their total size, attaining a larger shoot and whole-plant biomass. The shoot:root biomass ratio increased more rapidly through time in the E+ seedlings, attaining a value nine times higher in the E+ than the E group 50days after sowing. Such differences between the E+ and E seedlings were not explained by the growth allometry between shoots and roots. The seedlings of P.distans infected with the Epichloe endophyte were initially handicapped by their postponed emergence, but this disadvantage was quickly overcome by their superior growth capacity. The decrease in the relative allocation to roots may indicate that endophytes increase the performance of roots as resource-acquiring organs and/or reduce the role of roots in protection against herbivores.","Czarnoleski, M; Olejniczak, P; Górzynska, K; Kozlowski, J; Lembicz, M",NA,NA,NA,"Czarnoleski, M.; Olejniczak, P.; Gorzynska, K.; Kozlowski, J.; Lembicz, M.",NA,Altered allocation to roots and shoots in the endophyte-infected seedlings of Puccinellia distans (Poaceae),PLANT BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Górzyńska, Karolina/ABE-7506-2020; Kozlowski, Jan/K-5549-2012; Czarnoleski, Marcin/H-2893-2015","Czarnoleski, Marcin/0000-0003-2645-0360; Lembicz, Marlena/0000-0003-1714-4716; Gorzynska, Karolina/0000-0002-4226-1706; Olejniczak, Pawel/0000-0002-6269-6811; Kozlowski, Jan/0000-0002-7084-2030",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1435-8603,1438-8677,NA,NA,NA,MAR,2013,15,2,NA,NA,NA,264,273,NA,10.1111/j.1438-8677.2012.00633.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1438-8677.2012.00633.x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,22726626,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000314756900002,NA,2483,Both
11,Both,"Asexual systemic fungi that live symbiotically within grasses are viewed as strong mutualists on the basis of theory and empirical studies of introduced agronomic grasses. Evolutionary theory predicts that microbial symbionts that lose sexuality and rely on propagules of their hosts for transmission should evolve to benefit their hosts. Fungal endophytes of some cultivated turf and pasture grasses are well known for increasing plant performance and competitive abilities, especially under stress, and increasing resistance to herbivores, pathogens, and root-feeders by virtue of fungal alkaloids. The assumption of mutualism, however, has rarely been tested in native grasses, which often harbor high but variable frequencies of systemic asexual endophytes. We tested the effect of Neotyphodium infections for the native grass Arizona fescue in a 3-yr field experiment. We strictly controlled host genotype and manipulated soil moisture and nutrients. Infection generally decreased host growth in terms of plant volume, number of tillers, and dry mass of shoots and roots. Infected plants also showed decreased reproduction in terms of number and mass of seeds, and the seeds produced by infected plants had lower germination success than plants without their endophytes, suggesting that the negative effects of the symbiont are transferred to the next generation. Plant genotype strongly influenced host's growth and reproduction and interacted with the presence of the endophyte, but the interaction was usually in the direction of negative effects. Our results challenge the notion that systemic asexual endophytes must be plant mutualists for infections to persist in nature. We propose other hypotheses to explain the variable but usually high endophyte frequencies in natural populations of grasses.","Faeth, SH; Sullivan, TJ",NA,NA,NA,"Faeth, SH; Sullivan, TJ",NA,Mutualistic asexual endophytes in a native grass are usually parasitic,AMERICAN NATURALIST,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0003-0147,1537-5323,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2003,161,2,NA,NA,NA,310,325,NA,10.1086/345937,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/345937,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12675375,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000181152300010,NA,989,Absence
12,Presence,"Bacterial and fungal endophytes may help their host in terms of improved tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses and enhanced growth. European apple canker, caused by Neonectria ditissima, is widespread in apple-growing regions. Infection by N. ditissima occurs through artificial or natural wounds, including leaf scars, picking wounds, and pruning cuts. Using F-1 progeny trees in an experimental orchard derived from a cross between a canker-susceptible genotype and a canker-tolerant or -resistant genotype, we assessed both bacterial and fungal endophyte communities in apple leaf scars, and determined correlations of endophytes with canker development. All trees were artificially inoculated with an N. ditissima isolate postplanting. Specific components of apple endophytes as well as a number of individual fungal or bacterial groups in leaf scars were partially genetically controlled by host genotypes. Several bacterial groups were significantly correlated with canker-related traits, mostly positively associated with canker tolerance. A few fungal groups may facilitate canker development whereas others may compete with canker. However, most of these microbial groups could not be identified to the species level with confidence; even for those groups which could be assigned to the species level, there is insufficient knowledge about their ecological characteristics in relation to plants. The present results may be used to inform further research using biocontrol to manage N. ditissima and breeding for resistance.","Papp-Rupar, M; Karlstrom, A; Passey, T; Deakin, G; Xu, XM",NA,NA,NA,"Papp-Rupar, Matevz; Karlstrom, Amanda; Passey, Thomas; Deakin, Greg; Xu, Xiangming",NA,The Influence of Host Genotypes on the Endophytes in the Leaf Scar Tissues of Apple Trees and Correlation of the Endophytes with Apple Canker (<i>Neonectria ditissima</i>) Development,PHYTOBIOMES JOURNAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Xu, Xiangming/I-3050-2014","Karlstrom, Amanda/0000-0002-2884-6759; Papp-Rupar, Matevz/0000-0001-6248-685X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2471-2906,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2022,6,2,NA,NA,NA,127,138,NA,10.1094/PBIOMES-10-21-0061-R,http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PBIOMES-10-21-0061-R,NA,May-22,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000799711300003,NA,1370,Both
13,Both,"Understanding the dynamics of a hereditary symbiosis requires testing how ecological factors alter not only the fitness consequences of the symbiosis, but also the rate of symbiont transmission to the next generation. The relative importance of these two mechanisms remains unresolved because studies have not simultaneously examined how the ecological context of the symbiosis influences both costs/benefits and the rate of vertical transmission. Fungal endophytes in grasses have provided particularly tractable systems for investigating the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of hereditary symbiosis. Here we examine interactions between a fungal endophyte. Epichloe amarillans, and its grass host, Agrostis hyemalis, under altered abiotic and biotic contexts: a gradient of water availability and in the presence versus absence of soil microbes. We show that benefits of the symbiosis were strongest when water was limiting. Symbiotic plants at the lowest watering level produced similar to 40% more inflorescences and greater seed mass than non-symbiotic plants, while at the highest watering level, symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants did not significantly differ in reproductive fitness. Benefits appear to accrue by allowing hosts to escape from drought, a response that has not been previously reported to be endophyte-mediated. Symbiotic plants at the lowest watering level flowered 9 days earlier than non-symbiotic plants. Interestingly, our results suggest the symbiosis may be costly in the presence of soil microbes, as on live soil, the biomass of symbiotic plants was lower than the biomass of symbiont-free plants. We detected no effect of either the biotic or abiotic context on the rate of symbiont vertical transmission, suggesting that the context-dependent benefits of the symbiosis are the more important driver of variation in symbiont frequency in this system.

14,Both,"In 2006, a controlled infection study was performed in the 'Kranzberger Forst' to address the following questions: (1) Will massive artificial inoculation with Apiognomonia errabunda override the previously observed inhibitory effect of chronic ozone? (2) Can biochemical or molecular markers be detected to account for the action of ozone? To this end six adult beech trees were chosen, three ozone fumigated (2 x ozone) and three control trees (ambient = 1 x ozone). Spore-sprayed branches of sun and shade crown positions of each of the trees, and uninoculated control branches, were enclosed in 1004 plastic bags for one night to facilitate infection initiation. Samples were taken within a five-week period after inoculation. A. errabunda infestation levels quantified by real-time PCR increased in leaves that were not fumigated with additional ozone.

Although ingestion of infected plant tissues has detrimental effects on insects, birds, domestic livestock, and laboratory rodents, little is known about the consequences of endophyte consumption for wild rodent consumers. This multigenerational study investigated how consumption of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) seeds infected with the endophytic fungus Acremonium coenophialum affects prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). Breeding pairs were fed one of three base diets: laboratory rodent chow (C; control diet), 50% uninfected tall fescue seeds plus 50% chow (E-), or 50% endophyte-infected seeds plus 50% chow (E+). In the first generation, the E+ diet suppressed food and water intake, growth rates, and reproductive success, so no voles fed on the E+ diet could be followed in the second generation. In general, voles of the two generations performed similarly on the C and E- diets. Our findings show that prairie voles are sensitive to the presence of endophytes, or associated alkaloids, in their diets, and suggest that free-ranging voles avoid consuming endophyte-infected plant tissues if other foods are available.","Durham, WF; Tannenbaum, MG",NA,,NA,"Durham, WF; Tannenbaum, MG",NA,"Effects of endophyte consumption on food intake, growth, and reproduction in prairie voles",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,,,,NA,,Acremonium coenophialum; Festuca arundinacea; Microtus ochrogaster; endophyte; food intake; growth response; herbivory; reproduction; rodent,"Durham W.F., Division of Science, Truman State University, Kirksville, MO 63501, United States; Tannenbaum M.G., Division of Science, Truman State University, Kirksville, MO 63501, United States","Division of Science, Truman State University, Kirksville, MO 63501, United States","M.G.

Mycelial development and stromata formation on host plants is suggested to be in part regulated by sugar concentration. Atkinsonella hypoxylon and B. epichloe were shown to colonize wax droplets, suggesting that these species may gain some energy for stroma formation from the waxy cuticle present superficially on grass plants. Most members of the Balansieae demonstrated colonization of oil droplets and protein hydrolysis capacity, the significance of which is undetermined.","WHITE, JF; BREEN, JP; MORGANJONES, G",NA,NA,NA,"WHITE, JF; BREEN, JP; MORGANJONES, G",NA,"SUBSTRATE UTILIZATION IN SELECTED ACREMONIUM, ATKINSONELLA AND BALANSIA SPECIES",MYCOLOGIA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"White, James/C-2280-2009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0027-5514,1557-2536,NA,NA,NA,SEP-OCT,1991,83,5,NA,NA,NA,601,610,NA,10.2307/3760215,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3760215,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1991GQ09700008,NA,4098,Absence
18,Presence,"This research was conducted to determine the nature and incidence of fungal root endophytes on fourwing saltbush, Atriplex canescens (Pursh) Nutt. Root colter cells of fourwing saltbush in arid rangelands of the southwestern United States were analyzed and found to be regularly colonized with three types of endophytic fungi: septate, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM), and Chytridiomycetes. Septate fungi were 2.7 times more prevalent than VAM and formed intimate non-pathogenic associations characterized by inter- and intracellular hyphae, coils, microsclerotia, and occasional labyrinthine or ''Hartig net'' structures similar to those affiliated with ectendomycorrhizae. External hyphae formed intimate associations with soil and sand particles. Typically, VAM were characterized by hyphae, vesicles, and (at times) coils. VAM were 2.2 times more prevalent than chytrids. Chytrids were rather common and were expressed as resting and active sporangia found within root cortex cells. The widespread occurrence of these non-destructive fungal associations with plants implies that they have an important role in plant survival in arid environments.","Barrow, JR; Havstad, KM; McCaslin, BD",NA,NA,NA,"Barrow, JR; Havstad, KM; McCaslin, BD",NA,"Fungal root endophytes in fourwing saltbush, Atriplex canescens, on arid rangelands of southwestern USA",ARID SOIL RESEARCH AND REHABILITATION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0890-3069,NA,NA,NA,NA,APR-JUN,1997,11,2,NA,NA,NA,177,185,NA,10.1080/15324989709381470,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15324989709381470,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1997XD31700006,NA,8595,Absence
19,Both,"Dollar spot disease, caused by the fungal pathogen Clarireedia jacksonii, is a major problem in many turfgrass species, particularly creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera). It is well-established that strong creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra subsp. rubra) exhibits good dollar spot resistance when infected by the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae. This endophyte-mediated disease resistance is unique to the fine fescues and has not been observed in other grass species infected with other Epichloe spp. The mechanism underlying the unique endophyte-mediated disease resistance in strong creeping red fescue has not yet been established. We pursued the possibility that it may be due to the presence of an abundant secreted antifungal protein produced by E. festucae. Here, we compare the activity of the antifungal protein expressed in Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris, and Penicillium chrysogenum. Active protein was recovered from all systems, with the best activity being from Pe. chrysogenum. In greenhouse assays, topical application of the purified antifungal protein to creeping bentgrass and endophyte-free strong creeping red fescue protected the plants from developing severe symptoms caused by C. jacksonii. These results support the hypothesis that Efe-AfpA is a major contributor to the dollar spot resistance observed with E. festucae-infected strong creeping red fescue in the field, and that this protein could be developed as an alternative or complement to fungicides for the management of this disease on turfgrasses.","Fardella, PA; Tian, ZP; Clarke, BB; Belanger, FC",NA,NA,NA,"Fardella, Patrick A.; Tian, Zipeng; Clarke, Bruce B.; Belanger, Faith C.",NA,"The <i>Epichloe festucae</i> Antifungal Protein <i>Efe</i>-AfpA Protects Creeping Bentgrass (<i>Agrostis stolonifera</i>) from the Plant Pathogen <i>Clarireedia jacksonii</i>, the Causal Agent of Dollar Spot Disease",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Belanger, Faith/0000-0002-8725-0824",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2309-608X,NA,NA,NA,OCT,2022,8,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3390/jof8101097,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof8101097,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36294663,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000873026400001,NA,2143,Both
20,Other,"Plants are colonized various microorganisms including endophytes. These microbes can play an important role in agricultural production as they promote plant growth and/or enhance the resistance of their host plant against diseases and environmental stress conditions. Although culture-independent molecular approaches such as DNA barcoding have greatly enhanced our understanding of bacterial and fungal endophyte communities, there are some methodical problems when investigating endophyte diversity. One main issue are sequence contaminations such as plastid-derived rRNA gene sequences which are co-amplified due to their high homology to bacterial 16S rRNA genes. The same is true for plant and fungal ITS sequences. The application of highly specific-primers suppressing co-amplification of these sequence contaminations is a good solution for this issue. Here, we describe a detailed protocol for assessing bacterial and fungal endophyte diversity in plants using these primers in combination with next-generation sequencing.","Wemheuer, B; Wemheuer, F",NA,"Streit, WR; Daniel, R",NA,"Wemheuer, Bernd; Wemheuer, Franziska",NA,Assessing Bacterial and Fungal Diversity in the Plant Endosphere,"METAGENOMICS: METHODS AND PROTOCOLS, 2ND EDITION",Methods in Molecular Biology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1064-3745,1940-6029,978-1-4939-6691-2; 978-1-4939-6689-9,NA,NA,NA,2017,1539,NA,NA,NA,NA,75,84,NA,10.1007/978-1-4939-6691-2_6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-6691-2_6,10.1007/978-1-4939-6691-2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27900685,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000412190900007,NA,6167,Absence
21,Review,"This chapter answers the questions what, how, where, when, and who of measuring Neotyphodium oenophialum (Morgan-Jones and Gams) Glenn, Bacon, and Hanlin endophyte in tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceaum (Schreb.) Darbysh.]. Analysis is a technical procedure that usually is performed on samples collected from the field and sent to a laboratory. The most common description of endophyte infection is the proportion of tillers in a field that have endophyte present. The availability of new detection options allows measurement with relatively simple laboratory equipment. The commercial availability of nontoxic novel endophytes in tall fescue is making the detection of endophytes and determination of their toxic potential complex. This is due to the need for the analysis to distinguish those plants with endophytes that are producing toxic alkaloids from those plants with endophytes that are producing nontoxic alkaloids.

22,Presence,"The root fungal endophyte Piriformospora indica promotes the growth and survival of plants belonging to a number of species when exposed to various abiotic stresses, including drought, a major constraint of crop productivity. The application of 'omics technologies has revealed much of the molecular basis of the plant drought stress response. Here, the proteomic and metabolomic response of the leaves of moisture-stressed barley plants inoculated with P. indica was characterized. The abundance of 145 proteins was altered by the imposition of moderate drought on plants inoculated by P. indica, as was that of 104 in non-inoculated plants, while an episode of more severe stress altered the content of, respectively, 144 and 462 proteins. Many of these responsive proteins were involved in the plant's primary metabolism, in particular acting to mitigate the damage caused by oxidative stress. Colonization of the roots by P. indica enhanced the activity of both the photosystem and the electron transfer chain, and also promoted the accumulation of proteins protective of photorespiration, energy modulation, primary metabolism, transporters and autophagy. The beneficial effect of P. indica colonization on autophagy in plants exposed to stress may relate to alterations in the host's amino acid metabolism.","Ghaffari, MR; Mirzaei, M; Ghabooli, M; Khatabi, B; Wu, YQ; Zabet-Moghaddam, M; Moharnmadi-Nejad, G; Haynes, PA; Hajirezaei, MR; Sepehri, M; Salekdeh, GH",NA,NA,NA,"Ghaffari, Mohammad Reza; Mirzaei, Mehdi; Ghabooli, Mehdi; Khatabi, Behnam; Wu, Yunqi; Zabet-Moghaddam, Masoud; Moharnmadi-Nejad, Ghasem; Haynes, Paul A.; Hajirezaei, Mohammad Reza; Sepehri, Mozhgan; Salekdeh, Ghasem Hosseini",NA,Root endophytic fungus <i>Piriformospora indica</i> improves drought stress adaptation in barley by metabolic and proteomic reprogramming,ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mirzaei, Mohammad/S-3198-2017; Ghabooli, Mehdi/K-3365-2019; Salekdeh, Ghasem/E-4198-2012; ghaffari, mohammad/B-7840-2019; Ghaffari, Mohammad Reza/KII-4990-2024","Mohammadi-Nejad, Ghasem/0000-0002-5767-9734; mirzaei, mahdi/0000-0001-9817-9157; Haynes, Paul/0000-0003-1472-8249; Ghaffari, Mohammad Reza/0000-0002-7139-8613; Salekdeh, Ghasem Hosseini/0000-0002-5124-4721; Sepehri, Mozhgan/0000-0003-1190-9407; Ghabooli, Mehdi/0000-0002-6173-7327; Mirzaei, Mehdi/0000-0001-8727-4984",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0098-8472,1873-7307,NA,NA,NA,JAN,2019,157,NA,NA,NA,NA,197,210,NA,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.10.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.10.002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000454465500020,NA,8300,Absence

Ergopeptide alkaloids, predominantly ergovaline, constituted 10 to 50 percent of the total ergot alkaloid concentration, which was as high as 14 milligrams per kilogram in sheaths and 1.5 milligrams per kilogram in blades. Ergot alkaloid concentrations were substantially increased by application of large amounts (10 millimoles per liter) of potassium nitrate or ammonium chloride to infected plants in the greenhouse.

Here we performed a broad scale survey data to study whether the distribution patterns and the incidence of vertically-transmitted endophytes in populations of two native grasses from South-America, Poa lanuginosa Poir. and Poa bonariensis (Lam.) Kunth., are associated with environmental characteristics. We also characterized the endophytes from different populations to establish if the genotype of the endophytes is also correlated with environmental variables. The incidence of endophytes ranged from 0 to 100 % in both host species. In P. lanuginosa, endophytes were only found in populations on sandy coastal dunes and their incidence was positively associated with winter regime rainfall and soil water availability in the growing season. In P. bonariensis, endophytes were only found in populations in xerophytic forests and their incidence was highly associated with plant community. The distributions of infested populations suggested that the endophytes are not found in those areas with the most favorable or most stressing growth conditions accordingly to climatic or edaphical characteristics. Only the vertically transmitted hybrid endophyte species Neotyphodium tembladerae was detected in both host species. Under the hypothesis of vertical transmission, these results suggested that the endophyte should have been lost in endophyte free populations but is maintained in populations established in environments presenting moderate stress as salinity or short drought periods.","Iannone, LJ; Mc Cargo, PD; Giussani, LM; Schardl, CL",NA,NA,NA,"Iannone, Leopoldo J.; Mc Cargo, Patricia D.; Giussani, Liliana M.; Schardl, Christopher L.",NA,Geographic distribution patterns of vertically transmitted endophytes in two native grasses in Argentina,SYMBIOSIS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Giussani, Liliana/GQQ-1964-2022; Schardl, Christopher/P-5655-2014","Giussani, Liliana Monica/0000-0002-4883-4034; Schardl, Christopher/0000-0003-2197-0842",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0334-5114,1878-7665,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2013,59,2,NA,NA,NA,99,110,NA,10.1007/s13199-012-0214-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-012-0214-y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000316971300004,NA,7877,Both
26,Both,"Polyploidy and symbiotic Epichloe fungal endophytes are common and heritable characteristics that can facilitate environmental range expansion in grasses. Here we examined geographic patterns of polyploidy and the frequency of fungal endophyte colonized plants in 29 Festuca rubra L. populations from eight geographic sites across latitudes from Spain to northernmost Finland and Greenland. Ploidy seemed to be positively and negatively correlated with latitude and productivity, respectively. However, the correlations were nonlinear; 84% of the plants were hexaploids (2n = 6x = 42), and the positive correlation between ploidy level and latitude is the result of only four populations skewing the data. In the southern-most end of the gradient 86% of the plants were tetraploids (2n = 4x = 28), whereas in the northernmost end of the gradient one population had only octoploid plants (2n = 8x = 56). Endophytes were detected in 22 out of the 29 populations. Endophyte frequencies varied among geographic sites, and populations and habitats within geographic sites irrespective of ploidy, latitude or productivity. The highest overall endophyte frequencies were found in the southernmost end of the gradient, Spain, where 69% of plants harbored endophytes. In northern Finland, endophytes were detected in 30% of grasses but endophyte frequencies varied among populations from 0% to 75%, being higher in meadows compared to riverbanks. The endophytes were detected in 36%, 30% and 27% of the plants in Faroe Islands, Iceland and Switzerland, respectively. Practically all examined plants collected from southern Finland and Greenland were endophyte-free, whereas in other geographic sites endophyte frequencies were highly variable among populations. Common to all populations with high endophyte frequencies is heavy vertebrate grazing. We propose that the detected endophyte frequencies and ploidy levels mirror past distribution history of F. rubra after the last glaciation period, and local adaptations to past or prevailing selection forces such as vertebrate grazing.","Dirihan, S; Helander, M; Väre, H; Gundel, PE; Garibaldi, LA; Irisarri, JGN; Saloniemi, I; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Dirihan, Serdar; Helander, Marjo; Vare, Henry; Gundel, Pedro E.; Garibaldi, Lucas A.; Irisarri, J.

Within the phytobiome, the microbiome consists of the microorganisms associated with the plants comprising the endophytes and epiphytes. Endophytes are microorganisms, mainly consisting of bacteria and fungi, which colonise internal plant tissues without causing any disease symptom or tissue damage in different hosts. All these organisms associated to the plant contribute to its fitness. In this article, we revised a total of 103 studies containing the terms phytobiomes and microbiomes and endophytes, with the aims of reviewing: (i) the evolution of the term endophyte and the evolution of the endophyte condition; (ii) the current literature on studies considering the endophyte community within phytobiomes; and (iii) the literature on the bacteria living in fungal endophytes. In our analyses, we highlighted the biases that have been introduced in the phytobiomes' studies. For example, the presence of endohyphal bacteria could have contributed to overestimating the number of bacterial endophytes in the scientific literature.

Bare ground, turfgrass cover, and weed cover varied over time with grass species. Stands of tall fescue generally had more bare ground, greater weed cover, and less grass cover than stands of perennial ryegrass during the first year following seeding. However, this trend was reversed over time with stands of perennial ryegrass having more bare ground, more weed cover, and less turfgrass cover compared to stands of tall fescue after four years. The influence of endophyte infection was much weaker than predicted having a significant negative influence only on cover by one weed species, Cerastium vulgatum. Results indicated that grass species and fungal endophyte infection may influence patterns of weed occurrence in low maintenance lawns, although the influence of grass species is likely far more important in this regard.

Plants rely upon both nitrogen and phosphorous, for essential growth processes, and are often provided by mycorrhizal fungi. In this study, we investigated the cellular proteome of Serendipita vermifera MAFF305830 and closely related Serendipita vermifera subsp. bescii NFPB0129 grown in vitro under (N) ammonium and (P) phosphate starvation conditions. Mycelial growth pattern was documented under these conditions to correlate growth-specific responses to nutrient starvation. We found that N-starvation accelerated hyphal radial growth, whereas P-starvation accelerated hyphal branching. Additionally, P-starvation triggers an integrated starvation response leading to remodelling of lipid metabolism. Higher abundance of an ammonium transporter known to serve as both an ammonium sensor and stimulator of hyphal growth was detected under N-starvation. Additionally, N-starvation led to strong up-regulation of nitrate, amino acid, peptide, and urea transporters, along with several proteins predicted to have peptidase activity. Taken together, our finding suggests S. bescii and S. vermifera have the metabolic capacity for nitrogen assimilation from organic forms of N compounds. We hypothesize that the nitrogen metabolite repression is a key regulator of such organic N assimilation.","Ray, P; Abraham, PE; Guo, YQ; Giannone, RJ; Engle, NL; Yang, ZK; Jacobson, D; Hettich, RL; Tschaplinski, TJ; Craven, KD",NA,NA,NA,"Ray, Prasun; Abraham, Paul E.; Guo, Yingqing; Giannone, Richard J.; Engle, Nancy L.; Yang, Zamin K.; Jacobson, Daniel; Hettich, Robert L.; Tschaplinski, Timothy J.; Craven, Kelly D.",NA,"Scavenging organic nitrogen and remodelling lipid metabolism are key survival strategies adopted by the endophytic fungi, <i>Serendipita vermifera</i> and <i>Serendipita bescii</i> to alleviate nitrogen and phosphorous starvation in vitro",ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hettich, Robert/N-1458-2016; Giannone, Richard/ABC-8247-2020; Abraham, Paul/K-5599-2015; Tschaplinski, Timothy/D-6382-2018; Engle, Nancy L/D-6494-2018","Craven, Kelly/0000-0002-1597-9413; Giannone, Richard/0000-0001-8551-0138; Engle, Nancy L/0000-0003-0290-7987",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1758-2229,NA,NA,NA,NA,AUG,2019,11,4,NA,NA,NA,548,557,NA,10.1111/1758-2229.12757,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.12757,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30970176,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000474226700008,NA,6703,Both

In B. eriopoda (black grama), significant increases in plant biomass were not observed. However, early plant heights and crown diameters, establishment rates, and stolon production were higher in some callus treatments. In S. cryptandrus (sand dropseed), all variables were positively influenced by one or more of the endophyte treatments. Biomass increases ranged from 2.5- to threefold over untreated plants, and harvested seed increased 5.9-fold in plants treated with endophytes from A. canescens (fourwing saltbush).

Chromosome counts of the dwarfs are identical to typical smooth cordgrass (2n = 62), and smooth cordgrass-specific random amplified DNA markers confirm the species identity of the dwarf. Field collected clonal fragments of the dwarf grown for 2 yr under high-nutrient conditions maintained the dwarf syndrome, as did plants grown from the seed of a dwarf. The dwarf condition is not caused by endophytic fungi. The first dwarf smooth cordgrass patch was discovered in 1991, and by 1996 five separate dwarf patches had appeared within 200 m of the original. Since 1991, total area covered by the dwarf ecotype has increased sixfold to 140 m(2). The ecological range of the dwarf smooth cordgrass ecotype is similar to that of S. patens, a competitor on the Atlantic coast.

Our results suggest that, alongside factors such as climate, soil, and vegetation properties, root colonization by ectomycorrhizal, arbuscular mycorrhizal, and dark septate endophytic fungi also shapes tree-associated microbiomes. Notably, the structure of root and soil microbiomes across our sites ismore strongly and consistently associated with dark septate endophyte colonization than with mycorrhizal colonization and many abiotic factors. Root colonization by dark septate endophytes also has a consistent negative association with the relative abundance and diversity of nutrient cycling genes.

Each plant compartment usually represents a unique ecological niche hosting a distinct microbial community and niche differentiation, which may mirror distinct functions of a specialized microbiota, has been mainly investigated for bacteria. Far less is known for the fungal components of the plant-associated microbiota. Here, we applied a metabarcoding approach to describe the fungal assemblages in different organs of Vaccinium myrtillus plants (Ericaceae) collected in a subalpine meadow in North-West Italy, and identified specific taxa enriched in internal tissues of roots, stems, leaves and flowers. We also traced the distribution of some important fungi commonly associated with plants of the family Ericaceae, namely the ericoid mycorrhizal (ErM) fungi and the dark septate endophytes (DSE), both playing important roles in plant growth and health. Operational taxonomic units attributed to established ErM fungal species in the genus Hyaloscypha and to DSE species in the Phialocephala-Acephala applanata complex (PAC) were found in all the plant organs. Mycorrhizal fungi are thought to be strictly associated with the plant roots, and this first observation of ErM fungi in the above-ground organs of the host plant may be explained by the evolutionary closeness of ErM fungi in the genus Hyaloscypha with non mycorrhizal fungal endophytes. This is also witnessed by the closer similarities of the ErM fungal genomes with the genomes of plant endophytes than with those of other mycorrhizal fungi, such as arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal fungi.","Daghino, S; Martino, E; Voyron, S; Perotto, S",NA,NA,NA,"Daghino, Stefania; Martino, Elena; Voyron, Samuele; Perotto, Silvia",NA,Metabarcoding of fungal assemblages in <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> endosphere suggests colonization of above-ground organs by some ericoid mycorrhizal and DSE fungi,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Martino, Elena/KJD-5112-2024; Daghino, Stefania/AAO-7718-2021; VOYRON, Samuele/ABG-2929-2020","DAGHINO, Stefania/0000-0001-5722-1558",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2045-2322,NA,NA,NA,NA,30-Jun,2022,12,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1038/s41598-022-15154-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-15154-1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35773465,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001014944000039,NA,6215,Both
40,Both,"Background. Plants possess a sophisticated immune system to defend from herbivores. These defence responses are regulated by plant hormones including salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA). Sometimes, plant defences can be complemented by the presence of symbiotic microorganisms. A remarkable example of this are grasses establishing symbiotic associations with Epichloe fungal endophytes. We studied the level of resistance provided by the grass' defence hormones, and that provided by Epichloe fungal endophytes, against an introduced herbivore aphid. These fungi protect their hosts against herbivores by producing bioactive alkaloids. We hypothesized that either the presence of fungal endophytes or the induction of the plant salicylic acid (SA) defence pathway would enhance the level of resistance of the grass to the aphid. Methods. Lolium multiflorum plants, with and without the fungal endophyte Epichloe occultans, were subjected to an exogenous application of SA followed by a challenge with the aphid, Sipha maydis. Results. Our results indicate that neither the presence of E. occultans nor the induction of the plant's SA pathway regulate S. maydis populations. However, endophytesymbiotic plants may have been more tolerant to the aphid feeding because these plants produced more aboveground biomass. We suggest that this insect insensitivity could be explained by a combination between the ineffectiveness of the specific alkaloids produced by E. occultans in controlling S. maydis aphids and the capacity of this herbivore to deal with hormone-dependent defences of L. multiflorum.","Bastías, DA; Martínez-Ghersa, MA; Newman, JA; Card, SD; Mace, WJ; Gundel, PE",NA,NA,NA,"Bastias, Daniel A.; Alejandra Martinez-Ghersa, Maria; Newman, Jonathan A.; Card, Stuart D.; Mace, Wade J.; Gundel, Pedro E.",NA,<i>Sipha maydis</i> sensitivity to defences of <i>Lolium multiflorum</i> and its endophytic fungus <i>Epichloe</i> occultans,PEERJ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Bastias, Daniel/AFN-3093-2022; Newman, Jonathan/A-5932-2008","Bastias, Daniel A./0000-0002-0522-5538; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Card, Stuart/0000-0001-7140-7471; Newman, Jonathan/0000-0003-3155-4084",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2167-8359,NA,NA,NA,NA,18-Dec,2019,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.7717/peerj.8257,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8257,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31976166,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000503384400005,NA,1165,Both

42,Review,"Fungal endophytes of tropical trees are expected to be exceptionally species rich as a consequence of high tree diversity in the tropics and the purported host restriction among the endophytes. Based on this premise, endophytes have been regarded as a focal group for estimating fungal numbers because their possible hyperdiverse nature would reflect significantly global fungal diversity. We present our consolidated ten-year work on 75 dicotyledonous tree hosts belonging to 33 families and growing in three different types of tropical forests of the NBR in the Western Ghats, southern India. We conclude that endophyte diversity in these forests is limited due to loose host affiliations among endophytes. Some endophytes have a wide host range and colonize taxonomically disparate hosts suggesting adaptations in them to counter a variety of defense chemicals in their hosts. Furthermore, such polyphagous endophytes dominate the endophyte assemblages of different tree hosts. Individual leaves may be densely colonized but only by a few endophyte species. It appears that the environment (the type of forest in this case) has a larger role in determining the endophyte assemblage of a plant host than the taxonomy of the host plant. Thus, different tropical plant communities have to be studied for their endophyte diversity to test the generalization that endophytes are hyperdiverse in the tropics, estimate their true species richness, and use them as a predictor group for more accurate assessment of global fungal diversity.","Suryanarayanan, TS; Murali, TS; Thirunavukkarasu, N; Rajulu, MBG; Venkatesan, G; Sukumar, R",NA,NA,NA,"Suryanarayanan, T.

44,Presence,"Needle pathogens cause the discoloration, death, or premature abscission of conifer foliage, reducing growth and vigor, and repeated defoliation may eventually result in tree mortality. Since 2016, forest managers in the southeast United States have reported the increasing scale, frequency, and severity of needle disease outbreaks on the region's principal timber species, loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.). These recent outbreaks are raising concern throughout the region, as needle diseases are not traditionally considered a threat to P. taeda. Lecanosticta acicola (Thum.) Syd., the native causal agent of brown-spot needle blight, has been recovered from some outbreaks. However, the full array of fungi associated with symptoms has not been explored. In this research, P. taeda foliage was collected from affected stands throughout the region and analyzed to identify fungi associated with needle disease symptoms. We employed targeted molecular diagnostics to confirm the presence or absence of L. acicola and DNA metabarcoding to characterize the foliar mycobiome and screen for other potential pathogens. L. acicola was detected among symptomatic needles from multiple states, particularly in western portions of the P. taeda range, but rarely from stands in eastern states. Metabarcoding revealed pathogens in needles and identified associations among pathogenic fungi, differing symptoms (including needle discoloration and necrosis), and signs of fungal fruiting bodies. Additionally, the fungal community of needles varied with patterns of symptom presentation. This study is the first regionwide assessment of fungi associated with recent large-scale needle disease outbreaks on P. taeda and identifies multiple pathogens that warrant further study.","Meinecke, CD; Niyas, AMM; McCarty, E; Quesada, T; Smith, JA; Villari, C",NA,NA,NA,"Meinecke, Colton D.; Niyas, Afaq M.

48,Other,"Different forms of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal inoculum are found in soil patches with differing histories. These inoculum types include spores, infected root fragments, and extramatrical hyphae. Utilizing root observation chambers, detailed observations were made of the growth dynamics of mycorrhizal hyphae from inoculum sources to roots and the subsequent radiation out from individual colonized root segments. There were several types of hyphal architecture classified by whether the external hyphae were entering (infecting) a plant root or developing from the root surface and growing out into the soil matrix. Morphologically, individual hyphal filaments within all architectural types looked quite similar and clear architectural differences could only be identified when distinct sets of interconnected hyphal filaments were studied. The primary hyphal architectural types observed in the soil were classified as runner hyphae, hyphal bridges, absorptive hyphal networks, germ tubes, and infection networks produced by spores and root fragments. The specialized hyphal architectures of these fungal endophytes appear to be linked to the unique function of each hyphal type. Runner hyphae and infection networks from either spores or root fragments were observed to be capable of infecting new root segments. Absorptive hyphal networks were never observed to act as units of infection and were classified as structures primarily involved in the acquisition of soil resources.

Result We uncovered a non-random distribution of endophyte diversity in which branchlets had the greatest and seeds had the lowest endophytic fungal diversity. In contrast, litter endophytic bacteria had the highest diversity, and branchlets had the lowest diversity. As for fungi, a large part of the seed microbiome was transmitted to the phyllosphere, while a large part of the bacterial microbiome in the seed was transmitted to the root.

Endophytes are microorganisms which associate with healthy plant tissues, persisting without causing diseases symptoms in the host and normally benefitting them through improving plant ability to withstand environmental stresses. In this contribution, the hypothesis of fungal endophytes existence in the plane trees as well as their relationship with morphological characteristics of trees and nutrient elements of leaves were studied in the central part of Iran. The experiment was performed according to an unbalanced completely randomized design. Approximate age and height of plane trees were recorded and then the greenness and visual appearance were evaluated. Healthy shoots and bark pieces were collected and surface sterilized then placed in petri dishes containing PDA. The results showed that endophytes frequency were significantly greater in age-old trees (60.04%) than young ones (39.96%). Endophytes existence had a positive correlation with iron (Fe) and potassium (K) concentrations of the leaves, and trees height and circumference. Also, there was a positive correlation between the presence of fungal endophytes and improved visual appearance of plane trees. The results suggest that fungal endophytes association enhanced nutrient elements assimilation in trees contributing at least partly to elevated survival of age-old plane trees.","Khorsandy, S; Nikbakht, A; Sabzalian, MR; Pessarakli, M",NA,NA,NA,"Khorsandy, Soheila; Nikbakht, Ali; Sabzalian, Mohammad R.; Pessarakli, Mohammad",NA,"Effect of fungal endophytes on morphological characteristics, nutrients content and longevity of plane trees (<i>Platanus orientalis</i> L.)",JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sabzalian, Mohammad R./E-6279-2013","Pessarakli, Mohammad/0000-0002-7662-2258",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0190-4167,1532-4087,NA,NA,NA,NA,2016,39,8,NA,NA,NA,1156,1166,NA,10.1080/01904167.2015.1109113,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2015.1109113,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000379617800012,NA,8089,Both

56,Presence,"Premise Foliar fungal endophytes vary in their distributions across landscapes or plant host taxa, indicative of specialized ecologies and host specific adaptations. Accounts of specialization, however, depend on the taxonomic breadth and geographic range of the host plants included in each study. A broad region-scale study or deep sampling of diverse potential host species still remains relatively rare but is becoming increasingly possible with high-throughput sequencing. Methods Amplicon sequencing was used to rapidly identify the fungal endophytic community among six pine (Pinus, Pinaceae) species co-occurring across northeastern United States and to test for site and host specialization. We focused on the endophytic genus Lophodermium (Rhytismataceae), whose species' members are thought to specialize on different pine species, to test if amplicon sequencing could rapidly verify previously implied or discover new patterns of host specificity. Results While amplicon sequencing could analyze more samples at greater depths and recover greater numbers of unique Lophodermium taxa than when endophyte communities were surveyed with traditional culturing methods, patterns of specialization were not better supported. This may be because amplicon sequencing can indiscriminately capture non-host specific organisms found incidentally from plant tissues or because we have overestimated host-specificity in the past with biased culturing techniques. Conclusions Amplicon sequencing can quickly identify patterns of host specificity by allowing large-scale surveys but has limitations in quantifying the level of intimacy of these relationships.","Sarver, J; Schultz, E; Apigo, A; Gernandt, DS; Salas-Lizana, R; Oono, R",NA,NA,NA,"Sarver, Jake; Schultz, Ella; Apigo, Austen; Gernandt, David S.; Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo; Oono, Ryoko",NA,Deep sequencing across multiple host species tests pine-endophyte specificity,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo/LCL-2439-2024","Apigo, Austen/0000-0002-2525-0394; Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo/0000-0002-0761-2910; Gernandt, David/0000-0002-3592-994X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0002-9122,1537-2197,NA,NA,NA,JAN,2022,109,1,NA,NA,NA,83,98,NA,10.1002/ajb2.1792,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.1792,NA,Jan-22,NA,NA,NA,NA,34695224,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000743763200001,NA,6314,Absence

Beyond this, little is known about the relationship between endophyte colonization, leaf traits and spectral properties of leaves. We explore these relationships in Coccoloba cereifera, a plant well known for its symbiotic properties. Endophyte richness in C. cereifera was statistically correlated with leaf traits such as water content, the ratio of fresh weight/dry weight and polyphenol/leaf specific weight. Endophyte diversity was also related to spectral vegetation indices of chlorophyll content.

58,Presence,"Biological invasions are a threat to ecological communities and ecosystems, yet understanding the processes that mediate invasion and the environmental contexts in which these processes are important remains a challenge. In this study, we investigated how disturbance and biotic interactions with pathogens and microbial symbionts mediate invasion of American beachgrass (Ammophila breviligulata) in early-and late-successional coastal dune habitats. First, we tested the effect of disturbance on biomasses of two exotic beachgrass species (the invading A. breviligulata and the established A. arenaria) and a native beachgrass (Elymus mollis) by growing plants with and without a disturbance manipulation in early-and late-successional habitats. We quantified root colonization by fungal symbionts and infection by plant-parasitic nematodes to determine the effect of potential mutualists and pathogens on plant biomass. Second, we tested whether soil microbes associated with the established A. arenaria mediated A. breviligulata invasion by inoculating potted plants with microbes from early-and late-successional habitat. We found no effect of disturbance on biomass of the invading A. breviligulata or native E. mollis, whereas A. arenaria biomass increased when grown with disturbance. Colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and by fungal endophytes were poor predictors of plant biomass, and plant-parasitic nematodes were infrequently observed. Microbe addition increased belowground biomass of A. breviligulata, but not A. arenaria, compared to control treatments. Overall, our results suggest that A. breviligulata invasion in both the early-and late-successional habitat is mediated by its lack of disturbance dependence and positive effects of soil microbes. These results have important implications for other primary successional systems and contribute to our understanding of how ecological contexts influence invasion processes.","David, AS; May, G; Schmidt, D; Seabloom, EW",NA,NA,NA,"David, Aaron S.; May, Georgiana; Schmidt, Derek; Seabloom, Eric W.",NA,Beachgrass invasion in coastal dunes is mediated by soil microbes and lack of disturbance dependence,ECOSPHERE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Seabloom, Eric/AFT-3729-2022","Seabloom, Eric/0000-0001-6780-9259",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2150-8925,NA,NA,NA,NA,NOV,2016,7,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1002/ecs2.1527,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1527,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000392207600006,NA,1481,Absence
59,Presence,"The mutualistic symbiosis following infection of tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea, and perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne, by fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium spp.) results in the production of alkaloids that are feeding deterrents or toxic to insects and livestock. If the levels of the alkaloids can be manipulated by cultural practices in the grasses that are used for home lawns and golf courses, this could alleviate the need for pesticide applications in urban environments. We evaluated the influence of mowing height on the levels of some alkaloids in a greenhouse experiment for two consecutive months. In tall fescue, levels of four of the nine alkaloids, including one presumptive alkaloid, showed increased levels with increasing the mowing height from 2.5 to 7.5 cm. The alkaloids were ergonovine, ergocryptine, perloline methyl ether, and an unidentified alkaloid designated as unknown C. In perennial ryegrass, three out of six alkaloids, perloline methyl ether, chanoclavine, and unknown A, showed similar increases.

60,Both,"Induced resistance responses, including fungal endophyte-mediated resistance, have been well studied in both agricultural crops and grass systems. Yet, the effect of these processes and symbionts in forest trees is poorly known. Fungal endophytes have been found in all conifer forest systems examined to date and have been hypothesised to be involved in resistance-mediated responses. However, in the absence of functional studies the influence of these endophytes on the extended phenotype of the host plant is unclear. In this study we demonstrate that fungal endophytes from Pinus monticola were effective at increasing survival in host plants against the exotic pathogen Cronartium ribicola, which is responsible for the devastating disease called white pine blister rust. Seedlings previously inoculated with fungal endophytes lived longer than endophyte-free seedlings and also showed some reduction in white pine blister rust disease severity. This endophyte-mediated resistance was found to be effective over time, indicating persistence, and is hypothesised to be a form of induced resistance. Overall, this suggests fungal endophytes may play a determinative role in the structure of biological communities and could provide a useful alternative or ancillary management tool for combating pests and diseases.

Blocking of plant-specific sequences with peptide nucleic acid (PNA) clamps has been shown to improve metrics of detected microbial diversity in studies targeting 16S and 18S regions of rRNA genes. However, PNA clamping has not been applied to the plant ITS region of rRNA gene - a widely accepted fungal marker. By applying PNA clamping technique to ITS amplicon sequencing of the endophytic fungal community of elderberry this study shows that PNA clamping significantly reduces host-plant co-amplification with the universal ITS1/ITS4 primer set. However, PNA clamping in combination with the discriminatory ITS1F/ ITS2 primer set did not improve the metrics of fungal endophyte community ITS amplicon Illumina sequencing. This study shows that PNA clamping does not add practical benefit to taxonomic profiling of plant-associated fungal communities if the primers are already specific enough to exclude amplification of host DNA.","Borodus, A; Nikolajeva, J; Fridmanis, D; Gudra, D; Ustinova, M; Senkovs, M; Nikolajeva, V",NA,NA,NA,"Borodus, Anete; Nikolajeva, Juris; Fridmanis, Davids; Gudra, Dita; Ustinova, Maija; Senkovs, Maris; Nikolajeva, Vizma",NA,Does peptide-nucleic acid (PNA) clamping of host plant DNA benefit ITS1 amplicon-based characterization of the fungal endophyte community?,FUNGAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Fridmanis, Davids/I-3292-2017","Fridmanis, Davids/0000-0003-0310-0448; Gudra, Dita/0000-0002-9446-4521; Ustinova, Maija/0000-0001-7882-397X; Boroduske, Anete/0000-0003-0077-9811",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1754-5048,1878-0083,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2023,61,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1016/j.funeco.2022.101181,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funeco.2022.101181,NA,Sep-22,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000874540100005,NA,3605,Absence
62,Presence,"Monk fruit (Siraitia grosvenorii) is an herbaceous perennial vine of the Cucurbitaceae family cultivated commercially mainly in southern China. There is very little information available about the fungal endophytes in monk fruit. In this study, monk fruit plants were grown from seeds in a research greenhouse at Kwantlen Polytechnic University in British Columbia, Canada to explore the abundance and diversity of their fungal endophytes. Fungal endophytes were isolated from seeds, seedlings, mature monk fruit plants, and fruits, and cultured on potato dextrose agar and water agar media. Isolates were identified by microscopic examination and BLAST comparison of ITS sequences to published sequences in GenBank. At least 150 species of fungal endophytes representing 60 genera and 20 orders were recovered from monk fruit tissues. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was carried out to explore the similarity of fungal communities among roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds based on fungal orders. Our study showed that monk fruit plants are a rich source of fungal endophytes with the greatest abundance and diversity in leaves.

63,Presence,"Plants are colonized by fungal endophytes. In this study we tested the hypothesis that endophyte communities in mountain plants changes along the elevation gradient. We identified fungal endophytes in aboveground parts and seeds of five plant species at altitudes of 1000-1750 m in the Tatra National Park. Endophytes isolated from them were grouped into morphotypes on the basis of macroscopic features, such as mycelium shape and colour. Isolates representing individual morphotypes were identified using molecular markers ITS1 and ITS2. When comparing species composition, we used Bray-Curtis distance matrices, calculated on the basis of frequency of the given fungal species. We identified 16 species of fungal endophytes. Five taxa were absent from seeds in spite of their occurrence in mother plant leaves. Differences in altitude were not significantly correlated with fungal species composition observed at a given sampling site. There was also no significant correlation between the species composition of leaf and seed mycobiota. This suggests imperfect vertical transmission in the studied plant species.","Wysoczanski, W; Wegrzyn, E; Olejniczak, P; Lembicz, M",NA,NA,NA,"Wysoczanski, Wojciech; Wegrzyn, Ewa; Olejniczak, Pawel; Lembicz, Marlena",NA,Mycobiota diversity and its vertical transmission in plants along an elevation gradient in mountains,FUNGAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Węgrzyn, Ewa/AAK-9834-2020; Wysoczański, Wojciech/GZL-0029-2022","Lembicz, Marlena/0000-0003-1714-4716; Wegrzyn, Ewa/0000-0002-1403-6800; Wysoczanski, Wojciech/0000-0001-6238-4829",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1754-5048,1878-0083,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2023,63,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1016/j.funeco.2023.101244,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funeco.2023.101244,NA,Apr-23,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000983258900001,NA,6166,Both
64,Presence,"Facultative fungal endophytes are unspecialized plant-associated fungi capable of colonizing plant tissues without causing symptoms of disease. Studies suggest facultative fungal endophytes enhance cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) plant defense against insect herbivores and might alter emissions of volatile organic compounds. We tested for changes in emissions of volatile organic compounds using cotton plants treated with facultative fungal endophtytes Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo-Crivelli) Vuillemin strain GHA and Phialemonium inflatum (Burnside) strain TAMU490 in the presence and absence of herbivory. Solid-phase micro-extraction was used to sample static headspace of individual leaves in collection chambers designed specifically for the experiment. Relative abundance of volatile organic compounds was significantly affected by herbivory, but differences caused by treatment with B. bassiana or P. inflatum were not significant. Findings showed our sampling method can be used to assess constitutive and herbivore-induced volatile organic compound profiles from individual leaves, but further studies need to investigate mechanisms underlying facultative fungal endophyte-mediated herbivore resistance in cotton.","Gale, CC; Suh, CPC; Perez, J; Lesne, P; Wilson, C; Kramer, Z; Madamba, C; Sword, GA",NA,NA,NA,"Gale, Cody C.; Suh, Charles P-C; Perez, Jose; Lesne, Pierre; Wilson, Caroline; Kramer, Zoey; Madamba, Christine; Sword, Gregory A.",NA,Sampling Volatile Organic Compounds from Individual Cotton Leaves to Test Effects of Fungal Endophyte Treatments,SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pérez-Naranjo, José/JFT-1427-2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0147-1724,2162-2647,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2021,46,2,NA,NA,NA,299,304,NA,10.3958/059.046.0201,http://dx.doi.org/10.3958/059.046.0201,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000668593900001,NA,3328,Both
65,Both,"Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), an important pasture grass also occurring on semi-natural grasslands. can form a mutualistic association with the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium lolii. The presence of this fungus is known to confer resistance against different insect pests although the occurrence is also associated with ryegrass stagger. a neurological disorder occasionally seen in livestock grazing on endophyte-infected pastures. In breeding context the benefit of this symbiotic association is of interest. Sixty-two Danish locations representing twelve different habitat types were visited and investigated for the occurrence of the perennial ryegrass endophyte. Most habitats were different types of semi-natural grassland. Perennial ryegrass was investigated using tissue print immunoblot to determine N. lolii infection status. Endophytes were found at 77% of the locations, infection ranging from 4 to 82%. The highest infection rates v ere found in communities, which had been grazed or intensively used by the public. This can probably be explained by an enhanced survival of endophyte-infected plants in a plant community where grazing and intensive use are environmental stress factors. The conclusion from these results is that management practice of semi-natural grasslands is considered a driving force toward higher endophyte infection rates in Denmark. The survey additionally provides the first indication that Neotyphodium ryegrass endophytes are widely spread in semi-natural grass communities in Denmark and high levels of infection are not only restricted to Mediterranean regions with summer drought.

66,Other,"Microbes inhabiting the above- and belowground tissues of forest trees and soils play a critical role in the response of forest ecosystems to global climate change. However, generalizations about the vulnerability of the forest microbiome to climate change have been challenging due to responses that are often context dependent. Here we apply a risk assessment framework to evaluate microbial community vulnerability to climate change across forest ecosystems. We define factors that determine exposure risk and processes that amplify or buffer sensitivity to change, and describe feedback mechanisms that will modulate this exposure and sensitivity as climatic change progresses. This risk assessment approach unites microbial ecology and forest ecology to develop a more comprehensive understanding of forest vulnerability in the twenty-first century. In this Perspective, the authors develop a risk assessment framework for forest microbiomes under climate change that unites microbial and forest ecology. They define processes that amplify or buffer microbial sensitivity and exposure risk and feedbacks that mediate impacts on microbial communities.","Willing, CE; Pellitier, PT; Van Nuland, ME; Alvarez-Manjarrez, J; Berrios, L; Chin, KN; Villa, LM; Yeam, JJ; Bourque, SD; Tripp, W; Leshyk, VO; Peay, KG",NA,NA,NA,"Willing, C.

67,Presence,"We demonstrate that native grass species from coastal and geothermal habitats require symbiotic fungal endophytes for salt and heat tolerance, respectively. Symbiotically conferred stress tolerance is a habitat-specific phenomenon with geothermal endophytes conferring heat but not salt tolerance, and coastal endophytes conferring salt but not heat tolerance. The same fungal species isolated from plants in habitats devoid of salt or heat stress did not confer these stress tolerances. Moreover, fungal endophytes from agricultural crops conferred disease resistance and not salt or heat tolerance. We define habitat-specific, symbiotically-conferred stress tolerance as habitat-adapted symbiosis and hypothesize that it is responsible for the establishment of plants in high-stress habitats. The agricultural, coastal and geothermal plant endophytes also colonized tomato (a model eudicot) and conferred disease, salt and heat tolerance, respectively. In addition, the coastal plant endophyte colonized rice (a model monocot) and conferred salt tolerance. These endophytes have a broad host range encompassing both monocots and eudicots. Interestingly, the endophytes also conferred drought tolerance to plants regardless of the habitat of origin. Abiotic stress tolerance correlated either with a decrease in water consumption or reactive oxygen sensitivity/generation but not to increased osmolyte production. The ability of fungal endophytes to confer stress tolerance to plants may provide a novel strategy for mitigating the impacts of global climate change on agricultural and native plant communities.","Rodriguez, RJ; Henson, J; Van Volkenburgh, E; Hoy, M; Wright, L; Beckwith, F; Kim, YO; Redman, RS",NA,NA,NA,"Rodriguez, Rusty J.; Henson, Joan; Van Volkenburgh, Elizabeth; Hoy, Marshal; Wright, Leesa; Beckwith, Fleur; Kim, Yong-Ok; Redman, Regina S.",NA,Stress tolerance in plants via habitat-adapted symbiosis,ISME JOURNAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1751-7362,1751-7370,NA,NA,NA,APR,2008,2,4,NA,NA,NA,404,416,NA,10.1038/ismej.2007.106,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2007.106,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18256707,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000255288700006,NA,9290,Both
68,Presence,"Increases in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes influence the structure, function, and resilience of Caribbean forests. Trees in such forests harbor diverse fungal endophytes within leaves and roots. Fungal endophytes often are important for plant health and stress responses, but how their communities are impacted by hurricanes is not well known. We measured forest disturbance in Carite State Forest in Puerto Rico ca. 16 months after the passage of Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm. In three sites, each comprising three plots representing a local gradient of hurricane disturbance, we evaluated soil chemistry and used culture-free analyses to measure richness, phylogenetic diversity, and composition of endophyte communities in leaves and roots. We found that endophyte richness did not vary significantly among plant families or as a function of soil chemistry. Instead, leaf endophytes peaked in richness and decreased in phylogenetic diversity at intermediate levels of disturbance. Root endophytes did not show such variation, but both leaf- and root endophyte communities differed in species composition as a function of disturbance across the forest. Locations with less disturbance typically hosted distinctive assemblages of foliar endophytes, whereas more disturbed locations had more regionally homogeneous endophyte communities. Together, our results show that changes in endophyte richness and phylogenetic diversity can be detected in aboveground tissues more than a year after major storms. In turn, pervasive shifts in endophyte community composition both aboveground and belowground suggest a subtle and lasting effect of hurricanes that merits further study, potentially contributing to the promotion of spatially heterogeneous endophyte assemblages at a landscape scale in these diverse island forests.","Carrión, NC; Troche, CL; Arnold, AE",NA,NA,NA,"Carrion, Nicole Colon; Troche, Chad Lozada; Arnold, A.

69,Presence,"Locoweeds are Astragalus and Oxytropis species that contain the toxic alkaloid swainsonine. Swainsonine accumulates in all parts of the plant with the highest concentrations found in the above ground parts. A fungal endophyte, Undifilum oxytropis, found in locoweed plant species, is responsible for the synthesis of swainsonine. By using quantitative PCR, the endophyte can be quantified in locoweed species. Endophyte amounts differ between plant parts and in some instances do not mirror the concentrations of swainsonine in the corresponding parts. Two groups of Oxytropis sericea were identified: one that accumulated high concentrations of swainsonine and another where swainsonine was not detected, or concentrations were near the detection threshold. The plants with high swainsonine concentrations had quantitatively higher amounts of endophyte. Alternatively, plants with low or no swainsonine detected had quantitatively lower endophyte amounts. In addition, swainsonine and endophyte concentrations were not distributed uniformly within the same plant when separated into stalks (leaves, scape(s), and flowers/pods). These findings provide evidence as to why plants in the same population accumulate different concentrations of swainsonine, and they have important implications for sampling of locoweed plants.","Cook, D; Gardner, DR; Ralphs, MH; Pfister, JA; Welch, KD; Green, BT",NA,NA,NA,"Cook, Daniel; Gardner, Dale R.; Ralphs, Michael H.; Pfister, James A.; Welch, Kevin D.; Green, Benedict T.",NA,Swainsoninine Concentrations and Endophyte Amounts of Undifilum oxytropis in Different Plant Parts of Oxytropis sericea,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0098-0331,1573-1561,NA,NA,NA,OCT,2009,35,10,NA,NA,NA,1272,1278,NA,10.1007/s10886-009-9710-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-009-9710-9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19904570,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000272034300014,NA,4883,Both

71,Presence,"Plant-associated microbes have been increasingly recognized for influencing host populations, plant communities, and even herbivores and predators. Thus, understanding factors that affect the distribution and abundance of microbial symbioses may be important for predicting the ecological dynamics of communities. Using endophytic fungi-grass symbioses, we explored how intrinsic traits of the symbiosis, specifically transmission mode, may influence symbiont frequencies in host populations. Combining published literature with new field surveys, we compared Epichloe endophytes, which had mixed horizontal and vertical transmission, with Neotyphodium endophytes, which were exclusively vertically transmitted from host plants to seeds. Exclusively vertical transmission should select against pathogenicity because symbionts depend entirely on hosts for reproduction. Across 118 host species, we found that Neotyphodium hosts had 40-130% higher symbiont frequencies than Epichloe hosts. In field surveys, endophyte frequency was positively correlated with the local density of hosts, but only for Epichloe, suggesting that contagiously spread Epichloe may attain higher frequencies when hosts are more abundant. Epichloe endophytes were also more likely than Neotyphodium to have imperfect vertical transmission; thus, hosts may reduce the transmission of more pathogenic symbionts to seeds. Results are consistent with the conclusion that the evolutionary transition to exclusively vertical transmission can alter patterns of symbiont frequency in nature.","Rudgers, JA; Afkhami, ME; Rúa, MA; Davitt, AJ; Hammer, S; Huguet, VM",NA,NA,NA,"Rudgers, Jennifer A.; Afkhami, Michelle E.; Rua, Megan A.; Davitt, Andrew J.; Hammer, Samantha; Huguet, Valerie M.",NA,A fungus among us: broad patterns of endophyte distribution in the grasses,ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rúa, Megan/G-4187-2011","Rua, Megan A./0000-0002-2883-2795",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0012-9658,1939-9170,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2009,90,6,NA,NA,NA,1531,1539,NA,10.1890/08-0116.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-0116.1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19569368,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000266662500014,NA,6117,Both
72,Both,"Exploring the regional pattern of variation in traits driven by symbiotic interactions may provide insights to understand the evolutionary processes that operate over plant populations. Polyploidy, which is associated with fitness improvement, is expected to increase with latitude and altitude. However, it has never been explored in relation with the occurrence of epichloid fungal endophytes in plants. Both, variation in ploidy level and in the incidence of fungal endophytes, are known to occur in species of fine fescues. Here, we surveyed the occurrence of systemic fungal endophytes in natural Festuca vivipara populations in North European islands. In addition, we identified the fungal species associated with this grass and determined the predominant ploidy level for each population. Endophytes were found in four of six, two of three, and one of three populations for Faroe Islands, Iceland and Great Britain, respectively. With an average low incidence level of 15 % in infected populations, there was no relationship between infection level and either latitude or altitude. The phylogenetic analysis based on sequences ITS and the tub2 genes, supports that the endophytic species is EpichloA << festucae, the same as in other fine fescues. We found no variation in ploidy level as all the plants were tetraploid (4X) with 28 chromosomes, a pattern which contrasts with the variation reported in previous antecedents. Our results suggest that apart from low and variable benefits of the endophyte to the plants, there would be a complex dynamics between epichloid endophytes and species of the fine fescue complex which merits further studies.","Gundel, PE; Dirihan, S; Helander, M; Zabalgogeazcoa, I; Väre, H; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, P.

73,,"Non-native Phragmites australis decreases biodiversity and produces dense stands in North America. We surveyed the endophyte communities in the stems, leaves and roots of collections of P. australis obtained from two sites with a low and high salt concentration to determine differences in endophyte composition and assess differences in functional roles of microbes in plants from both sites. We found differences in the abundance, richness and diversity of endophytes between the low saline collections (18 species distributed in phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Stramenopiles (Oomycota); from orders Dothideales, Pleosporales, Hypocreales, Eurotiales, Cantharellales and Pythiales; Shannon H = 2.639; Fisher alpha = 7.335) and high saline collections (15 species from phylum Ascomycota; belonging to orders Pleosporales, Hypocreales, Diaporthales, Xylariales and Dothideales; Shannon H = 2.289; Fisher alpha = 4.181). Peyronellaea glomerata, Phoma macrostoma and Alternaria tenuissima were species obtained from both sites. The high salt endophyte community showed higher resistance to zinc, mercury and salt stress compared to fungal species from the low salt site. These endophytes also showed a greater propensity for growth promotion of rice seedlings (a model species) under salt stress. The results of this study are consistent with the 'habitat-adapted symbiosis hypothesis' that holds that endophytic microbes may help plants adapt to extreme habitats. The capacity of P. australis to establish symbiotic relationships with diverse endophytic microbes that enhance its tolerance to abiotic stresses could be a factor that contributes to its invasiveness in saline environments. Targeting the symbiotic associates of P. australis could lead to more sustainable control of non-native P. australis.","Soares, MA; Li, HY; Kowalski, KP; Bergen, M; Torres, MS; White, JF",NA,NA,NA,"Soares, Marcos Antonio; Li, Hai-Yan; Kowalski, Kurt P.; Bergen, Marshall; Torres, Monica S.; White, James Francis",NA,Evaluation of the functional roles of fungal endophytes of <i>Phragmites australis</i> from high saline and low saline habitats,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"White, James/C-2280-2009; Kowalski, Kurt/GXZ-5008-2022; Soares, Marcos Antonio/B-7683-2013","Kowalski, Kurt/0000-0002-8424-4701; White, James/0000-0002-6780-7066; Soares, Marcos Antonio/0000-0002-8938-3188",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1387-3547,1573-1464,NA,NA,NA,SEP,2016,18,9,NA,SI,NA,2689,2702,NA,10.1007/s10530-016-1160-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1160-z,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000382136500022,NA,5428,Both
74,,"Epichloid endophytes are well known symbionts of many cool-season grasses that may alleviate environmental stresses for their hosts. For example, endophytes produce alkaloid compounds that may be toxic to invertebrate or vertebrate herbivores. Achnatherum robustum, commonly called sleepygrass, was aptly named due to the presence of an endophyte that causes toxic effects to livestock and wildlife. Variation in alkaloid production observed in two A. robustum populations located near Weed and Cloudcroft in the Lincoln National Forest, New Mexico, suggests two different endophyte species are present in these populations. Genetic analyses of endophyte-infected samples revealed major differences in the endophyte alkaloid genetic profiles from the two populations, which were supported with chemical analyses. The endophyte present in the Weed population was shown to produce chanoclavine I, paspaline, and terpendoles, so thus resembles the previously described EpichloA << funkii. The endophyte present in the Cloudcroft population produces chanoclavineI, ergonovine, lysergic acid amide, and paspaline, and is an undescribed endophyte species. We observed very low survival rates for aphids feeding on plants infected with the Cloudcroft endophyte, while aphid survival was better on endophyte infected plants in the Weed population. This observation led to the hypothesis that the alkaloid ergonovine is responsible for aphid mortality. Direct testing of aphid survival on oat leaves supplemented with ergonovine provided supporting evidence for this hypothesis. The results of this study suggest that alkaloids produced by the Cloudcroft endophyte, specifically ergonovine, have insecticidal properties.","Shymanovich, T; Saari, S; Lovin, ME; Jarmusch, AK; Jarmusch, SA; Musso, AM; Charlton, ND; Young, CA; Cech, NB; Faeth, SH",NA,NA,NA,"Shymanovich, Tatsiana; Saari, Susanna; Lovin, Mary E.; Jarmusch, Alan K.; Jarmusch, Scott A.; Musso, Ashleigh M.; Charlton, Nikki D.; Young, Carolyn A.; Cech, Nadja B.; Faeth, Stanley H.",NA,Alkaloid Variation Among Epichloid Endophytes of Sleepygrass (<i>Achnatherum robustum</i>) and Consequences for Resistance to Insect Herbivores,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Young, Carolyn/Q-2963-2019; Jarmusch, Alan/AAH-5780-2019; Jarmusch, Scott/ABA-9399-2021; Tall, Susanna/A-1677-2016","Jarmusch, Scott/0000-0002-1021-1608; Young, Carolyn/0000-0003-0406-8398; Tall, Susanna/0000-0002-3746-4728; Charlton, Nikki/0000-0001-9580-5466",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0098-0331,1573-1561,NA,NA,NA,JAN,2015,41,1,NA,NA,NA,93,104,NA,10.1007/s10886-014-0534-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-014-0534-x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25501262,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000348424800012,NA,3220,Both

78,,A trade-off between growth and defence functions is commonly observed in plants. We propose that the association of plants with Epichloe fungal endophytes may eliminate this trade-off.

We parameterized stochastic population models using data from a 14-year symbiont-removal experiment including seven grass species that host Epichloe fungal endophytes. Results provide novel evidence that symbiotic benefits arise not only through improved mean fitness, but also through dampened inter-annual variance. Hosts with ""fast"" life-history traits benefited most from symbiont-mediated demographic buffering. Under current climate conditions, contributions of demographic buffering were modest compared to benefits to mean fitness. However, simulations of increased stochasticity amplified benefits of demographic buffering and made it the more important pathway of host-symbiont mutualism. Microbial-mediated variance buffering is likely an important, yet cryptic, mechanism of resilience in an increasingly variable world.","Fowler, JC; Ziegler, S; Whitney, KD; Rudgers, JA; Miller, TEX",NA,NA,NA,"Fowler, Joshua C.; Ziegler, Shaun; Whitney, Kenneth D.; Rudgers, Jennifer A.; Miller, Tom E.

85,,"The rice blast disease, caused by the fungal pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae (syn. Pyricularia oryzae), poses a significant threat to the global rice production. Understanding how this disease impacts the plant's microbial communities is crucial for gaining insights into hostpathogen interactions. In this study, we investigated the changes in communities of bacterial and fungal endophytes inhabiting different compartments in healthy and diseased plants. We found that both alpha and beta diversities of endophytic communities do not change significantly by the pathogen infection. Rather, the type of plant compartment appeared to be the main driver of endophytic community structures. Although the overall structure seemed to be consistent between healthy and diseased plants, our analysis of differentially abundant taxa revealed the specific bacterial and fungal operational taxonomic units that exhibited enrichment in the root and leaf compartments of infected plants. These findings suggest that endophyte communities are robust to the changes at the early stage of pathogen infection, and that some of endophytes enriched in infected plants might have roles in the defense against the pathogen.","Roy, M; Burragoni, SG; Jeon, J",NA,NA,NA,"Roy, Mehwish; Burragoni, Sravanthi Goud; Jeon, Junhyun",NA,Changes in Endophyte Communities across the Different Plant Compartments in Response to the Rice Blast Infection,PLANT PATHOLOGY JOURNAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1598-2254,2093-9280,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2024,40,3,NA,NA,NA,299,309,NA,10.5423/PPJ.OA.12.2023.0175,http://dx.doi.org/10.5423/PPJ.OA.12.2023.0175,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38835301,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001240262000007,NA,8276,Both

Nine hundred seventy-six isolates belonging to 38 fungal species were obtained. Phomopsis columnaris, Fusarium oxysporum and Trichoderma gamsii were the most frequently isolated, collectively representing 69% of the isolates. Fungal diversity in the roots was higher than in the aboveground organs and higher in spring than autumn. Endophyte community similarity between the above- and belowground organs and between seasons was low. Species composition also varied spatially, with the fungal composition of the roots varying more among locations than that of the aboveground organs.

Feasibility of endophytes in weed control was tested by manipulating endophyte colonization of meadow fescue (Scherodonus pratensis ex. Lolium pretense and Festuca pratensis) in three experiments. First, species richness, the cover percentages and biomass of detected species were estimated in replicated field plots seeded with endophyte-free (E-) or endophyte colonized (E+) meadow fescue. Four years after establishment of the grass monocultures, weed species richness and coverage was higher in E- plots compared to E+ plots. The cover percentages of meadow fescue decreased with weed invasions being 75% and 98% in E- and E+ plots, respectively. Similarly, the proportion of weeds in the total biomass was over 45% higher in E- plots compared to E+ plots at the end of the six years study. Half of the plots were subjected to herbivory by voles, but the effect of endophyte overrode the effect of herbivory. Second, the survival of individually grown E+ meadow fescues was higher and the plants were 50% larger and produced 54% more inflorescences than E- plants in a common garden experiment. Third, a seed germination test demonstrated that recruitment of new meadow fescues was not mediated by substances inhibiting seed germination potentially released by E+ plants. These results demonstrated that endophyte promoted competitive superiority of grass cultivars can hinder weed invasions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Although aspects of its biology are known, there is little information about its association with microbial communities, both above ground and below ground. Furthermore, it is unknown whether this species exhibits any form of plant-soil feedback (PSF), commonly seen in other invasive weeds. We conducted a PSF experiment, in which plants of I. glandulifera were grown in soil that supported the species and compared with plants grown in a control soil from the same locality. Soil nutrients were measured, and the soil and foliar microbial communities were assessed. Impatiens glandulifera grew larger and faster in conditioned soil compared with the control. Higher levels of phosphate were also found in conditioned soils. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) colonisation was lower in conditioned soils, suggesting that I.glandulifera may rapidly alter AMF communities in invaded areas. PSFs had a significant effect on the foliar endophyte community, with clear separation of species between conditioned and control soils. These results show that I.glandulifera displayed a positive PSF and the PSF mechanism extended beyond the soil microbial community to affect foliar endophytes. The observed increase in endophytes in plants grown in conditioned soil could enhance resistance to herbivory, thus further accentuating the invasive properties of this species.","Pattison, Z; Rumble, H; Tanner, RA; Jin, L; Gange, AC",NA,NA,NA,"Pattison, Z.; Rumble, H.; Tanner, R.

92,,"Plant microbiomes are shaped by forces working at different spatial scales. Environmental factors determine a pool of potential symbionts while host physiochemical factors influence how those microbes associate with distinct plant tissues. These scales are seldom considered simultaneously, despite their potential to interact. Here, we analyze epiphytic microbes from nine Hibiscus tiliaceus trees across a steep, but short, environmental gradient within a single Hawaiian watershed. At each location, we sampled eight microhabitats: leaves, petioles, axils, stems, roots, and litter from the plant, as well as surrounding air and soil. The composition of bacterial communities is better explained by microhabitat, while location better predicted compositional variance for fungi. Fungal community compositional dissimilarity increased more rapidly along the gradient than did bacterial composition. Additionally, the rates of fungal community compositional dissimilarity along the gradient differed among plant parts, and these differences influenced the distribution patterns and range size of individual taxa. Within plants, microbes were compositionally nested such that aboveground communities contained a subset of the diversity found belowground. Our findings indicate that both environmental context and microhabitat contribute to microbial compositional variance in our study, but that these contributions are influenced by the domain of microbe and the specific microhabitat in question, suggesting a complicated and potentially interacting dynamic.","Bernard, J; Wall, CB; Costantini, MS; Rollins, RL; Atkins, ML; Cabrera, FP; Cetraro, ND; Feliciano, CKJ; Greene, AL; Kitamura, PK; Olmedo-Velarde, A; Sirimalwatta, VNS; Sung, HW; Thompson, LPM; Vu, HT; Wilhite, CJ; Amend, AS",NA,NA,NA,"Bernard, Jared; Wall, Christopher B.; Costantini, Maria S.; Rollins, Randi L.; Atkins, Melissa L.; Cabrera, Feresa P.; Cetraro, Nicolas D.; Feliciano, Christian K.

93,,"Dark septate endophytes of the Phialocephala fortinii s.l. - Acephala applanata species complex (PAC) are abundant root colonizers of woody plants in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems where they form complex communities. Community structure was spatially stable for 3 years in a previous experiment, suggesting PAC's inability to disperse or mutual inhibition of neighboring PAC genotypes. The aim of this study was to test whether changes in PAC community structure occur at all. The community structure originally determined in 2004 was reassessed in 2014 in a Norway-spruce plantation using microsatellite genotyping. Most isolates belonged to Phialocephala turicensis, P. letzii, P. europaea, and P. helvetica in both years. P. uotilensis and Acephala applanata were rare. PAC species were the same at only two grid points in both years. P. europaea was more frequent than P. turicensis in 2004 whereas the situation was opposite in 2014. Only four of the 22 genotypes in 2004 were found in 2014. Interestingly, none of the genotypes was detected at the same grid points in both years. Extended sampling in 2014 led to a significantly higher number of grid points testing positive for the presence of P. turicensis and P. helvetica. More than 3 years are required to detect shifts in PAC community structures. The observed shifts suggest that PAC are able to disperse in soil or via root networks, though very slowly.","Stroheker, S; Queloz, V; Sieber, TN",NA,NA,NA,"Stroheker, Sophie; Queloz, Valentin; Sieber, Thomas N.",NA,Spatial and temporal dynamics in the <i>Phialocephala fortinii</i> s.l. - <i>Acephala applanata</i> species complex (PAC),PLANT AND SOIL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sieber, Thomas/JBJ-5736-2023","Queloz, Valentin/0000-0002-1888-4882",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0032-079X,1573-5036,NA,NA,NA,OCT,2016,407,2-Jan,NA,NA,NA,231,241,NA,10.1007/s11104-015-2790-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-015-2790-0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000385205100017,NA,2001,Both

95,,"The endophytic fungus Aciculosporium take (Ascomycota; Clavicipitaceae) causes continuous shoot growth in bamboo. The colonized shoot eventually results in witches' broom formation but maintains normal leaf arrangement and branching pattern. To analyze the mechanism of well-regulated symptom development, the location of the fungal endophytic hyphae in host tissues was visualized. A colorimetric in situ hybridization technique using a species-specific oligonucleotide probe targeting the 18S rRNA of A. take was used. In situ hybridization was performed on tissue sections of diseased shoots with or without external signs of fungal colonization. Specific signals were detected in intercellular spaces of the bamboo tissues. Most signals were detected in the shoot apical meristem and the leaf primordia. In addition, fewer signals were detected in the lateral buds, juvenile leaves, and stems. These results indicate that A. take grows endophytically, particularly in the shoot apical meristem of the host. The location of A. take hyphae suggests that the mechanism of symptom development can be explained by the action of exogenous fungal auxin, which continuously induces primordium initiation within the host.

96,,"Variation in the abilities of 35 isolates of the ericoid mycorrhizal fungal endophyte Hymenoscyplus ericae from two held sites to utilise inorganic and organic nitrogen sources in axenic culture has been investigated. While most isolates showed a preference for NH4+ as a sole nitrogen source, considerable variation was observed in the abilities of isolates to utilise amino acids and protein (BSA). In particular, large intraspecific variation was observed for glutamine and BSA utilisation, with some isolates thriving on these substrates while others produced little growth. The data suggest that individual isolates of H. ericae may vary considerably in their abilities to supply their host plants with nitrogen from different substrates in soil.

The fungus produces the alkaloid swainsonine, an alpha-mannosidase-inhibitor that causes serious damage to mammals when consumed. A real-time PCR technique was developed to quantify the colonization extent of in locoweeds and to compare it to the swainsonine concentration in the plants. Amplification of the endophyte nuclear ITS region allowed reliable quantification of DNA from field plants and cultures. Swainsonine concentration was highly correlated ( = 0.972, < 0.001) with the proportion of DNA during the first 4 weeks of culture growth. Species of and were sampled seasonally in New Mexico and Colorado for two years.

98,,"Agricultural crops growing in saline soils produce sub-optimal yields due to the negative effects of excess salts on plant growth and development. Salinity stress for crops is likely to increase as a result of climate change and the consequent salinisation of soils, particularly in coastal areas. In this study, we recovered fungal endophytes from the seeds of the wild barley relative Hordeum secalinum and tested their effects on a barley cultivar grown in a controlled environment under four levels of continuously applied salt stress: 0, 75, 150 and 250 mM NaCl. For the unstressed plants and plants stressed with 75 mM NaCl we found an endophyte-associated increase in early growth, grain dry weight, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, number of tillers, number of heads and number of grains. However, this relationship was reversed for the plants grown with 150 and 250 mM NaCl, where the endophytes negatively affected these traits. Plants stressed with the highest concentration of NaCl (250 mM) produced no grain. These results suggest that the endophytes may have potential to benefit field grown barley crops growing on moderately salt-stressed sites. © 2018 The Author(s).

99,,"Microbial populations residing in close contact with plants can be found in the rhizosphere, in the phyllosphere as epiphytes on the surface, or inside plants as endophytes. Here, we analyzed the microbiota associated with Espeletia plants, endemic to the Paramo environment of the Andes Mountains and a unique model for studying microbial populations and their adaptations to the adverse conditions of high-mountain neotropical ecosystems. Communities were analyzed using samples from the rhizosphere, necromass, and young and mature leaves, the last two analyzed separately as endophytes and epiphytes. The taxonomic composition determined by performing sequencing of the V5-V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene indicated differences among populations of the leaf phyllosphere, the necromass, and the rhizosphere, with predominance of some phyla but only few shared operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Functional profiles predicted on the basis of taxonomic affiliations differed from those obtained by GeoChip microarray analysis, which separated community functional capacities based on plant microenvironment. The identified metabolic pathways provided insight regarding microbial strategies for colonization and survival in these ecosystems. This study of novel plant phyllosphere microbiomes and their putative functional ecology is also the first step for future bioprospecting studies in search of enzymes, compounds, or microorganisms relevant to industry or for remediation efforts.","Ruiz-Pérez, CA; Restrepo, S; Zambrano, MM",NA,NA,NA,"Ruiz-Perez, Carlos A.; Restrepo, Silvia; Mercedes Zambrano, Maria",NA,Microbial and Functional Diversity within the Phyllosphere of <i>Espeletia</i> Species in an Andean High-Mountain Ecosystem,APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Restrepo, Silvia/G-1297-2010; Ruiz Perez, Carlos Alexander/JOZ-4162-2023; Zambrano, Maria/AAD-2805-2019","Restrepo, Silvia/0000-0001-9016-1040; Ruiz Perez, Carlos Alexander/0000-0001-7275-3923; Zambrano, Maria Mercedes/0000-0002-0796-4473",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0099-2240,1098-5336,NA,NA,NA,MAR,2016,82,6,NA,NA,NA,1807,1817,NA,10.1128/AEM.02781-15,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.02781-15,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,26746719,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000373339400017,NA,5157,Absence
100,,"Systemic fungal endophytes derive resources from hosts and can affect host resource movement and integration. We examined whether infection by Epichloe glyceriae altered clonal growth of its host, Glyceria striata, through changes in physiology. Growth of severed and intact stolons was compared to examine physiological integration in infected and disinfected (fungicide-treated) plants. To assess whether infection changed carbon (C) movement, labelling with C-14 was used. We found physiological integration did not affect biomass per stolon for either infected or disinfected plants. The severed stolon to intact stolon ratio for the number of daughter ramets within a plant did not differ by infection status, although fewer daughter ramets were produced on severed stolons of disinfected plants. C-14 movement from the labelled leaf was greater for infected stolons, whereas the labelled leaf retained more assimilate for stolons of disinfected plants.

101,,"Despite being major drivers of the dynamics and diversity of plant populations and communities, the spatial variability of phyllosphere fungal assemblages has been seldom explored. We used CE-SSCP and 454 pyrosequencing to quantify the spatial variability of European beech phyllosphere fungal assemblages with a hierarchical sampling design including four different spatial scales (tree, branch, group of leaves and individual leaf). Fungal assemblages were highly diverse, with high proportions of generalist and cosmopolitan fungi. The major part of the variability was at the smallest spatial scale, between individual leaves. Within a single tree canopy, dissimilarity between fungal assemblages generally increased with distance between leaves. This pattern may be driven by within-canopy gradients of leaf traits and microclimate. At the stand scale, dissimilarity between fungal assemblages was correlated with the genetic distance rather than the geographic distance between trees, consistent with the findings of community genetics studies. Our results were constant over a small simulated sequencing depth, providing opportunities for the design of large-scale studies addressing the relationship between the genetic variation of trees and the variation of associated phyllosphere fungal assemblages.

Three morphologically very similar species are found in the southern sector of the Yungas and Parana forests: D. hymenoides, D. krausii and D. reptans. The aim of this research was to characterise the morphoanatomy to better delimitate the taxa. Also, to evidence the presence of fungal endophytes. Conventional histological techniques were applied to fresh and FAA-fixed material. The anatomical structure of the different organs, in the three species, is similar; with collateral protostelic rhizomes, covered with simple or branched rhizoids; stipes teretes with glandular trichomes; uniestratified laminae formed by epidermal cells, with collateral vascular bundles; false veins formed by macrosclereids and stegmata or only by macrosclereids. The eglandular and glandular trichomes on the lamina differ in the species studied. The basal and middle portion of the involucre are pluristratified, with a vascular bundle at each margin, while the apical portion is formed by a one layer of epidermal cells; the receptacle is pluristratified with glandular trichomes on its surface. The presence of stegmata, collenchymatous tissue, sclerenchyma, mucilage fibers in phloem, pores in lamina and cuticle on the epidermis is evidenced and reported. Septate fungal endophytes were observed in epidermal cells of the rhizome, stipe and lamina of D. krausii and D. reptans. Species are differentiated by the following characters: shape of the lamina, diameter of the rhizome, number of false veins and the types of trichomes and pores.

CO2-induced changes in plant physiology can have ecosystem-wide implications and may alter plant-plant, plant-herbivore and plant-symbiont interactions. We examined the effects of three concentrations of CO2 (390, 800 and 1000ppm) and two concentrations of nitrogen fertilizer (0.004g N/week versus 0.2g N/week) on the physiological response of Neotyphodium fungal endophyte-infected and uninfected tall fescue plants. We used quantitative PCR to estimate the concentration of endophyte under altered CO2 and N conditions. We found that elevated CO2 increased the concentration of water-soluble carbohydrates and decreased the concentration of plant total amino acids in plants. Fungal-derived alkaloids decreased in response to elevated CO2 and increased in response to nitrogen fertilization. Endophyte concentration (expressed as the number of copies of an endophyte-specific gene per total genomic DNA) increased under elevated CO2 and nitrogen fertilization. The correlation between endophyte concentration and alkaloid production observed at ambient conditions was not observed under elevated CO2.

107,,"The lolines are a class of bioprotective alkaloids that are produced by Epichloe species, fungal endophytes of grasses. These alkaloids are saturated 1-aminopyrrolizidines with a C2 to C7 ether bridge, and are structurally differentiated by the various modifications of the 1-amino group: -NH2 (norloline), -NHCH3 (loline), -N(CH3)(2) (N-methylloline), -N(CH3)Ac (N-acetylloline), -NHAc (N-acetylnorloline), and -N(CH3)CHO (N-formylloline). Other than the LoIP cytochrome P450, which is required for conversion of N-methylloline to N-formylloline, the enzymatic steps for loline diversification have not yet been established. Through isotopic labeling, we determined that N-acetylnorloline is the first fully cyclized loline alkaloid, implying that deacetylation, methylation, and acetylation steps are all involved in loline alkaloid diversification. Two genes of the loline alkaloid biosynthesis (LOL) gene cluster, lolN and lolM, were predicted to encode an N-acetamidase (deacetylase) and a methyltransferase, respectively. A knockout strain lacking both lolN and lolM stopped the biosynthesis at N-acetylnorloline, and complementation with the two wild-type genes restored production of N-formylloline and N-acetylloline. These results indicated that lolN and lolM are required in the steps from N-acetylnorloline to other lolines. The function of LolM as an N-methyltransferase was confirmed by its heterologous expression in yeast resulting in conversion of norloline to loline, and of loline to N-methylloline. One of the more abundant lolines, N-acetylloline, was observed in some but not all plants with symbiotic Epichloe siegelii, and when provided with exogenous loline, asymbiotic meadow fescue (Lolium pratense) plants produced N-acetylloline, suggesting that a plant acetyltransferase catalyzes","Pan, J; Bhardwaj, M; Nagabhyru, P; Grossman, RB; Schardl, CL",NA,NA,NA,"Pan, Juan; Bhardwaj, Minakshi; Nagabhyru, Padmaja; Grossman, Robert B.; Schardl, Christopher L.",NA,Enzymes from Fungal and Plant Origin Required for Chemical Diversification of Insecticidal Loline Alkaloids in Grass-<i>Epichloe</i> Symbiota,PLOS ONE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pan, Juan/GSN-8862-2022; Nagabhyru, Padmaja/B-4263-2014; Schardl, Christopher/P-5655-2014","Bhardwaj, Minakshi/0000-0001-6544-7370; Schardl, Christopher/0000-0003-2197-0842",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1932-6203,NA,NA,NA,NA,22-Dec,2014,9,12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0115590,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115590,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25531527,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000348845100080,NA,7933,Absence

The hypothesis in this study was that the presence of EpichloA << coenophialum in the tall fescue shoot may alter chemical and biological properties of rhizospheric soil and, as a consequence, the soil hydraulic properties and aggregate stability in texture-dependent ways. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to characterize the effects of endophyte-tall fescue symbiosis on water repellency and hydraulic properties of the rhizosphere in six soil types. Aggregate water/ethanol sorptivities and water repellency were determined using a tension micro-infiltrometer. Soil organic carbon, hot-water soluble carbohydrates, basal soil respiration and water-dispersible clay as an index of aggregate instability were also measured. Endophytic symbiosis greatly enhanced soil organic carbon pools and hot-water soluble carbohydrates, especially for the medium- to fine-textured soils, and decreased the basal soil respiration. Changes in chemical and biological properties of the rhizosphere via endophyte infection and soil type altered the soil water repellency, hydraulic properties, and aggregate stability. Lower water sorptivity (due to hydrophobic coatings) and higher ethanol sorptivity (due to altered pore structure) were responsible for greater water repellency in the rhizosphere of endophyte-infected plants compared to endophyte-free ones. Greater sub-critical water repellency, organic carbon, and hot-water soluble carbohydrates induced by endophyte-tall fescue symbiosis could increase aggregate stability of the rhizosphere and facilitate ecosystem restoration in degraded arid lands.","Hosseini, F; Mosaddeghi, MR; Hajabbasi, MA; Sabzalian, MR",NA,NA,NA,"Hosseini, Fatemeh; Mosaddeghi, Mohammad R.; Hajabbasi, Mohammad A.; Sabzalian, Mohammad R.",NA,"Aboveground fungal endophyte infection in tall fescue alters rhizosphere chemical, biological, and hydraulic properties in texture-dependent ways",PLANT AND SOIL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hosseini Sedeh, Fatemeh/IAO-5027-2023; Sabzalian, Mohammad R./E-6279-2013; Hajabbasi, Mohammad/GLS-4685-2022; Mosaddeghi, Mohammad Reza/E-8925-2018","Mosaddeghi, Mohammad Reza/0000-0001-9730-3195; Hosseini, Fatemeh/0000-0002-3081-7367",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0032-079X,1573-5036,NA,NA,NA,MAR,2015,388,2-Jan,NA,NA,NA,351,366,NA,10.1007/s11104-014-2340-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-014-2340-1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000350571500028,NA,4612,Both

Five endophyte strains were tested, and the trait that showed the greatest significant difference in the drought-stressed plants was the number of tillers, where all of the endophyte treatments induced a greater number of tillers per plant. However, except in one case, the mean dry root weight for all plants was greater in the control plants, indicating preferential allocation of resources to aboveground parts in the endophyte treatments.

110,,"Experimental tests of community assembly mechanisms for host-associated microbiomes in nature are lacking. Asymptomatic foliar fungal endophytes are a major component of the plant microbiome and are increasingly recognized for their impacts on plant performance, including pathogen defense, hormonal manipulation, and drought tolerance. However, it remains unclear whether fungal endophytes preferentially colonize certain host ecotypes or genotypes, reflecting some degree of biotic adaptation in the symbioses, or whether colonization is simply a function of spore type and abundance within the local environment. Whether host ecotype, local environment, or some combination of both controls the pattern of microbiome formation across hosts represents a new dimension to the age-old debate of nature versus nurture. Here, we used a reciprocal transplant design to explore the extent of host specificity and biotic adaptation in the plant microbiome, as evidenced by differential colonization of host genetic types by endophytes. Specifically, replicate plants from three locally-adapted ecotypes of the native grass Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) were transplanted at three geographically distinct field sites (one home and two away) in the Midwestern US. At the end of the growing season, plant leaves were harvested and the fungal microbiome characterized using culture-dependent sequencing techniques. Our results demonstrated that fungal endophyte community structure was determined by local environment (i.e., site), but not by host ecotype. Fungal richness and diversity also strongly differed by site, with lower fungal diversity at a riparian field site, whereas host ecotype had no effect. By contrast, there were significant differences in plant phenotypes across all ecotypes and sites, indicating ecotypic differentiation of host phenotype.

113,,"Plant water use theory has largely been developed within a plant-performance paradigm that conceptualizes water use in terms of value for carbon gain and that sits within a neoclassical economic framework. This theory works very well in many contexts but does not consider other values of water to plants that could impact their fitness. Here, we survey a range of alternative hypotheses for drivers of water use and stomatal regulation. These hypotheses are organized around relevance to extreme environments, population ecology, and community ecology. Most of these hypotheses are not yet empirically tested and some are controversial (e.g. requiring more agency and behavior than is commonly believed possible for plants). Some hypotheses, especially those focused around using water to avoid thermal stress, using water to promote reproduction instead of growth, and using water to hoard it, may be useful to incorporate into theory or to implement in Earth System Models.","Blonder, BW; Aparecido, LMT; Hultine, KR; Lombardozzi, D; Michaletz, ST; Posch, BC; Slot, M; Winter, K",NA,NA,NA,"Blonder, Benjamin Wong; Aparecido, Luiza Maria Teophilo; Hultine, Kevin R.; Lombardozzi, Danica; Michaletz, Sean T.; Posch, Bradley C.; Slot, Martijn; Winter, Klaus",NA,"Plant water use theory should incorporate hypotheses about extreme environments, population ecology, and community ecology",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Slot, Martijn/H-3179-2019; Michaletz, Sean/AAO-8175-2021; Aparecido, Luiza/AAC-4833-2021; Posch, Bradley/AAL-5329-2021","Teophilo Aparecido, Luiza Maria/0000-0001-8642-6632; Posch, Bradley/0000-0003-0924-6608; Slot, Martijn/0000-0002-5558-1792; Hultine, Kevin/0000-0001-9747-6037",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0028-646X,1469-8137,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2023,238,6,NA,NA,NA,2271,2283,NA,10.1111/nph.18800,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.18800,NA,Mar-23,NA,NA,NA,NA,36751903,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000943956500001,NA,6107,Absence
114,,"PREMISE OF THE STUDY:Fungal endophytes have been shown to colonize all land plants, yet surprisingly little attention has been given to their community composition in ferns. We examined the diversity and temporal turnover of fungal endophytes in foliar tissue of the temperate western sword fern, Polystichum munitum, comparing taxa in newly emerged leaflets and in the same fronds after 1 mo of exposure in the field. METHODS:Utilizing next-generation sequencing, we sampled pinnae from P. munitum in spring, 2-3 d after they emerged. We additionally sampled pinnae 30 d later from the same fern blades. From these samples, we sequenced fungal DNA to characterize the initial colonization and temporal turnover of endophytes in the host. KEY RESULTS:We demonstrate that P. munitum is abundantly colonized by endophytes in newly emerged foliar tissue. However, 1 mo later, the community composition undergoes a marked shift: the overall richness of endophytes increases, but the evenness of the community wanes as a single taxon, Flagellospora fusarioides, comes to dominate. CONCLUSIONS:We conclude that P. munitum hosts a variety of fungal endophyte taxa, similarly to other land plants. However, the rapid shift of the endophyte community we report is an unprecedented observation. Therefore, we further conclude that repeated sampling should be the standard in endophyte studies, because single sampling events are not sufficient to capture the dynamic nature of these cryptic microfungi.","Younginger, BS; Ballhorn, DJ",NA,NA,NA,"Younginger, Brett S.; Ballhorn, Daniel J.",NA,Fungal endophyte communities in the temperate fern <i>Polystichum munitum</i> show early colonization and extensive temporal turnover,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0002-9122,1537-2197,NA,NA,NA,AUG,2017,104,8,NA,NA,NA,1188,1194,NA,10.3732/ajb.1700149,http://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1700149,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28814407,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000418649800007,NA,5719,Absence
115,,"Azospirillum brasilense is a plant growth-promoting bacterium that is utilized as a bio-fertilizer worldwide. Inoculation of crops with A. brasilense can lead to a substantial boost in crop yield, although this enhancement is variable. Sometimes crop production is enhanced as much as 70% and other times enhancement does not occur at all. To solve this problem, a greater understanding of A. brasilense - plant interactions is needed. While the root/rhizosphere ecology of A. brasilense has been studied extensively there are no significant studies that address whether A. brasilense populates above ground plant tissues. In this study, we use a combination of qPCR, transcriptomics, confocal microscopy, and culturing techniques to map the in-planta distribution of a GFP-expressing A. brasilense in Phaseolus vulgaris (common bush bean). We show that A. brasilense constitute part of the plant bacterial microflora well above the root system. During P. vulgaris development A. brasilense was shown to actively move to developing bean seeds where it forms a significant intercellular population. GFP-expressing A. brasilense was shown to vertically transmit to successive plant generations demonstrating that A. brasilense in the seed constitute an effective inoculum. The ability of A. brasilense to not only colonize roots but to also actively migrate to developing seeds indicates the existence of a more complex symbiotic relationship than previously understood.","Malinich, EA; Bauer, CE",NA,NA,NA,"Malinich, Elizabeth A.; Bauer, Carl E.",NA,The plant growth promoting bacterium <i>Azospirillum brasilense</i> is vertically transmitted in <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> (common bean),SYMBIOSIS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bauer, Carl/0000-0002-1432-0756",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0334-5114,1878-7665,NA,NA,NA,OCT,2018,76,2,NA,NA,NA,97,108,NA,10.1007/s13199-018-0539-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-018-0539-2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000444580100002,NA,1036,Absence
116,,"Soil contamination by metals is of particular interest, given that their retention times within the profile can be indefinite. Thus, phytostabilization can be viewed as a means of limiting metal toxicity in soils. Due to their ability to grow on contaminated soils, alders have repeatedly been used as key species in phytostabilization efforts. Alder ability to grow on contaminated sites stems, in part, from its association with microbial endophytes. This work emphasizes the fungal endophytes populations associated with Alnus incana ssp. rugosa and Alnus alnobetula ssp. crispa (previously A. viridis ssp. crispa) under a phytostabilization angle. Fungal endophytes were isolated from alder trees that were growing on or near disturbed environments; their tolerances to Cu, Ni, Zn, and As, and acidic pH (4.3, 3, and 2) were subsequently assessed. Cryptosporiopsis spp. and Rhizoscyphus spp. were identified as fungal endophytes of Alnus for the first time. When used as inoculants for alder, some isolates promoted plant growth, while others apparently presented antagonistic relationships with the host plant. This study reports the first step in finding the right fungal endophytic partners for two species of alder used in phytostabilization of metal-contaminated mining sites.","Lalancette, S; Lerat, S; Roy, S; Beaulieu, C",NA,NA,NA,"Lalancette, Steve; Lerat, Sylvain; Roy, Sebastien; Beaulieu, Carole",NA,Fungal Endophytes of <i>Alnus incana</i> ssp. <i>rugosa</i> and <i>Alnus alnobetula</i> ssp. <i>crispa</i> and Their Potential to Tolerate Heavy Metals and to Promote Plant Growth,MYCOBIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Roy, Sébastien/A-5615-2008","Roy, Sebastien/0000-0001-7183-0691",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1229-8093,2092-9323,NA,NA,NA,2-Oct,2019,47,4,NA,NA,NA,415,429,NA,10.1080/12298093.2019.1660297,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/12298093.2019.1660297,NA,Sep-19,NA,NA,NA,NA,32010463,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000486979500001,NA,6840,Both

Reduction in body weight for both the C fumiferana and L fiscellaria were observed at 25 and 50 mu m, respectively, and head capsules were reduced at 100 and 150 mu m.

120,,"Persistence and ubiquity of vertically transmitted Neotyphodium endophytes in grass populations is puzzling because infected plants do not consistently exhibit increased fitness. Using an annual grass population model, we show that the problems for matching endophyte infection and mutualism are likely to arise from difficulties in detecting small mutualistic effects, variability in endophyte transmission efficiency and an apparent prevalence of non-equilibrium in the dynamics of infection. Although endophytes would ultimately persist only if the infection confers some fitness increase to the host plants, such an increase can be very small, as long as the transmission efficiency is sufficiently high. In addition, imperfect transmission limits effectively the equilibrium infection level if the infected plants exhibit small or large reproductive advantage. Under frequent natural conditions, the equilibrium infection level is very sensitive to small changes in transmission efficiency and host reproductive advantage, while convergence to such an equilibrium is slow. As a consequence, seed immigration and environmental fluctuation are likely to keep local infection levels away from equilibrium.

121,,"Insect-induced galls are abnormal plant growths that can provide food and shelter to their inhabitants, resulting in stressed plant tissue that may alter the conditions for the colonization or proliferation of endophytic fungi. We investigated the effect gall formation has on fungal endophyte communities and diversity. Using three closely-related gall-forming aphid species that specialize on poplars, we characterized fungal endophyte diversity in galls and surrounding petiole and leaf lamina tissue. A total of 516 fungal endophyte samples were isolated from 272 tissue samples (32 leaves, 31 petioles, and 209 galls), resulting in 23 distinct morphotypes. Despite sharing a common host plant and often forming spatially contiguous galls, the endophyte profiles within the galls of each aphid species were distinct, not only from the galls of the other species, but also from surrounding plant tissue. These results suggest that insect galls can affect the composition of fungal endophyte species in plant tissues, by altering either the colonization or proliferation of their endophytic mycobiota. Likewise, fungal endophytes may be important in the ecology and evolution of insect galls.","Lawson, SP; Christian, N; Abbot, P",NA,NA,NA,"Lawson, Sarah P.; Christian, Natalie; Abbot, Patrick",NA,Comparative analysis of the biodiversity of fungal endophytes in insect-induced galls and surrounding foliar tissue,FUNGAL DIVERSITY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1560-2745,1878-9129,NA,NA,NA,MAY,2014,66,1,NA,NA,NA,89,97,NA,10.1007/s13225-013-0268-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13225-013-0268-z,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000338140300005,NA,4620,Both

123,,"Buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris), an invasive perennial grass in arid regions of the United States, has drastically modified natural ecosystems. Understanding the aboveground-belowground links between buffelgrass invasion and soil microbial communities will be critical for developing a comprehensive understanding of arid ecosystems and for deploying successful control strategies. In a randomized block-field experiment located in Tucson, AZ, U.S.A., we investigated the effects of buffelgrass removal via hand pulling and nitrogen addition (and their interaction) on soil microbial communities during an extreme drought (summer 2020). We found that experimental treatments did not significantly impact bacterial and archaeal community diversity and composition, while plant removal affected fungal community diversity and composition. In addition, the removal treatment increased the proportion of putative chitinolytic bacteria (genus Lysobacter) and decreased the proportion of putative fungal endophytes (genus Darksidea). Buffelgrass manual removal appeared to favor fungal endophyte death around and inside of leftover intact roots, which may result in an increase of chitinolytic bacteria thriving on the degradation of fungal cell walls. Overall, our results suggest that hand removal-which is a common type of buffelgrass control-can alter soil fungal communities and the proportion of certain microbial functional groups. As these changes could subsequently affect native plants, more research is needed to develop a comprehensive understanding of the effect of buffelgrass control efforts on target plants as well as surrounding ecosystem dynamics.","Williams, JP; Gornish, ES; Barberan, A",NA,NA,NA,"Williams, Jared P.; Gornish, Elise S.; Barberan, Albert",NA,Effects of buffelgrass removal and nitrogen addition on soil microbial communities during an extreme drought in the Sonoran Desert,RESTORATION ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Barberan, Albert/A-5319-2013","Gornish, Elise/0000-0002-2055-4874",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1061-2971,1526-100X,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2022,30,2,NA,SI,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1111/rec.13570,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.13570,NA,Nov-21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000713404000001,NA,1582,Both

Our objectives were to identify a set of molecular markers to assess genetic structure within and diversity among populations of CWR and VWR from the Southern Great Plains and to determine if these populations had an associated fungal endophyte. Nine CWR and five VWR populations and two barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars were genotyped using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers isolated from tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh.] expressed sequence tags (TF ESTs). Scorable fragments were produced by 31% of TF EST-SSRs tested, thus identifying a set of SSR markers for wildrye. Populations grouped into three clusters consisting of (i) three wild populations, one plant introduction, and two commercial sources of CWR; (ii) all VWR populations and three CWR plant introductions; and (iii) barley cultivars. Clustering indicated possible gene flow between CWR and VWR. Genetic variation within populations was minimal and comparable to that of the barley cultivars. Thus, unlike many ancestral cultivars and landraces of self-pollinated crops, CWR and VWR populations consisted of essentially pure lines and can be handled as such in a breeding program.

126,,"Despite the widespread occurrence of fungal endophytes (FE) in plants inhabiting arid ecosystems, the environmental and soil factors that modulate changes in FE diversity and community composition along an aridity gradient have been little explored. We studied three locations along the coast of the Atacama Desert in Chile, in which the plant Aristolochia chilensis naturally grows, and that differ in their aridity gradient from hyper-arid to semi-arid. We evaluated if root-associated FE diversity (frequency, richness and diversity indexes) and community composition vary as a function of aridity. Additionally, we assessed whether edaphic factors co-varying with aridity (soil water potential, soil moisture, pH and nutrients) may structure FE communities. We expected that FE diversity would gradually increase towards the aridity gradient declines, and that those locations that had the most contrasting environments would show more dissimilar FE communities. We found that richness indexes were inversely related to aridity, although this pattern was only partially observed for FE frequency and diversity. FE community composition was dissimilar among contrasting locations, and soil water availability significantly influenced FE community composition across the gradient. The results indicate that FE diversity and community composition associated with A. chilensis relate to differences in the aridity level across the gradient. Overall, our findings reveal the importance of climate-related factors in shaping changes in diversity, structure and distribution of FE in desert ecosystems.","Guevara-Araya, MJ; Escobedo, VM; Palma-Onetto, V; González-Teuber, M",NA,NA,NA,"Jose Guevara-Araya, Maria; Escobedo, Victor M.; Palma-Onetto, Valeria; Gonzalez-Teuber, Marcia",NA,Changes in Diversity and Community Composition of Root Endophytic Fungi Associated with <i>Aristolochia chilensis</i> along an Aridity Gradient in the Atacama Desert,PLANTS-BASEL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Palma, Valeria/AAG-1254-2020; González-Teuber, Marcia/ABH-2318-2021; Escobedo, Víctor/AAV-9690-2021","Gonzalez-Teuber, Marcia/0000-0003-0565-9333; Palma-Onetto, Valeria/0000-0002-0541-0135; Escobedo, Victor/0000-0003-2673-3803",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2223-7747,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2022,11,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3390/plants11111511,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants11111511,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35684284,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000809471600001,NA,2062,Both
127,,Fungal endophytes comprise a highly diverse group of particular interest for their relevant implications to the ecosystems they inhabit. The objective of this study was to infer the phylogenetic affinity between strains of Peroneutypa scoparia exhibiting different lifestyles to elucidate possible shifts in ecological roles. Specimens and living cultures used in the present study were obtained from decaying wood and from live stem tissues of the invasive host species Broussonetia papyrifera. The similarity between the fungal strains was studied through molecular analyses. The results showed a close phylogenetic link and high genetic similarity between endophytic and saprotrophic strains. The main findings suggest that P. scoparia has primary access to the substrate as an endophyte and then this organism may change its use of the available resources presenting a saprotrophic growth. These results provide valuable information about the roles that diatrypaceous fungi play as endophytes or as decaying wood inhabitants and contributes to evaluate the ecological significance of this group.

Oil palm ramets were first inoculated with homogenized fungal suspension. The treated fungal suspensions were assayed for CWDEs whereas the ramets were powderized for FTIR analysis. Results revealed that putative endophytes and host pathogen expressed all CWDEs, suggesting their probable roles in infection and colonization. Following inoculation, plant cell wall composition showed missing dips in spectra depicting changes to carbohydrate, xylan and lignin constituents. The indistinguishable FTIR spectra for putative endophyte-inoculated and pathogen-inoculated ramets suggest that both endophytes and pathogen have elicited similar responses to plant cell walls.

However, little is known about the degree of protection each offers to the other from different types of environmental stress. Our current study focused on the changes in response to toxic arsenic in the presence of an endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica that colonizes the paddy roots. The primary impact of arsenic was observed in the form of hyper-colonization of fungus in the host root and resulted in the recovery of its overall biomass, root damage, and chlorophyll due to arsenic toxicity. Further, fungal colonization leads to balance the redox status of the cell by adjusting the antioxidative enzyme system which in turn protects photosynthetic machinery of the plant from arsenic stress. We observed that fungus has ability to immobilize soluble arsenic and interestingly, it was also observed that fungal colonization restricts most of arsenic in the colonized root while a small fraction of it translocated to shoot of colonized plants. Our study suggests that P. indica protects the paddy (Oryza sativa) from arsenic toxicity by three different mechanisms viz. reducing the availability of free arsenic in the plant environment, bio-transformation of the toxic arsenic salts into insoluble particulate matter and modulating the antioxidative system of the host cell.","Mohd, S; Shukla, J; Kushwaha, AS; Mandrah, K; Shankar, J; Arjaria, N; Saxena, PN; Narayan, R; Roy, SK; Kumar, M",NA,NA,NA,"Mohd, Shayan; Shukla, Jagriti; Kushwaha, Aparna S.; Mandrah, Kapil; Shankar, Jai; Arjaria, Nidhi; Saxena, Prem N.; Narayan, Ram; Roy, Somendu K.; Kumar, Manoj",NA,Endophytic Fungi <i>Piriformospora indica</i> Mediated Protection of Host from Arsenic Toxicity,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kumar, Manoj/K-5427-2018; SHUKLA, JAGRITI/IQU-0123-2023","Kumar, Manoj/0000-0001-7500-4389",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-302X,NA,NA,NA,NA,10-May,2017,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3389/fmicb.2017.00754,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.00754,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28539916,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000401502500001,NA,1848,Absence
130,,"Background: Grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs) are disease complexes that are major threats to viticulture in most grapevine growing regions. The microbiomes colonizing plant belowground components form complex associations with plants, play important roles in promoting plant productivity and health in natural environments, and may be related to GTD development. To investigate associations between belowground fungal communities and GTD symptomatic or asymptomatic grapevines, fungal communities associated with three soil–plant compartments (bulk soils, rhizospheres, and roots) were characterized by ITS high-throughput amplicon sequencing across two years. Results: The fungal community diversity and composition differs according to the soil–plant compartment type (PERMANOVA, p < 0.001, 12.04% of variation explained) and sampling year (PERMANOVA, p < 0.001, 8.83%), whereas GTD symptomatology exhibited a weaker, but still significant association (PERMANOVA, p < 0.001, 1.29%). The effects of the latter were particularly prominent in root and rhizosphere community comparisons. Many GTD-associated pathogens were detected, but their relative abundances were not correlated (or were negatively correlated) to symptomatology. Fusarium spp., were enriched in symptomatic roots and rhizospheres compared to asymptomatic counterparts, suggesting that their abundances were positively correlated with symptomatic vines. Inoculation tests revealed that Fusarium isolates, similar to Dactylonectria macrodidyma, a pathogen associated with black foot disease, caused dark brown necrotic spots on stems in addition to root rot, which blackened lateral roots. Disease indices were higher with co-inoculation than single inoculation with a Fusarium isolate or D. macrodidyma, suggesting that Fusarium spp. can exacerbate disease severity when inoculated with other known GTD-associated pathogens. Conclusions: The belowground fungal microbiota of grapevines varied from soil–plant compartments, the years and whether showed GTD symptoms. The GTDs symptoms were related to the enrichment of Fusarium spp. rather than the relative abundances of GTD pathogens. These results demonstrate the effects of fungal microbiota of roots and rhizospheres on GTDs, while providing new insights into opportunistic pathogenesis of GTDs and potential control practices. © 2023, The Author(s).",Li Y.; Li X.; Zhang W.; Zhang J.; Wang H.; Peng J.; Wang X.; Yan J.,NA,,NA,"Li, Yonghua (54410830900); Li, Xinghong (36062282100); Zhang, Wei (56306763200); Zhang, Jiao (59072219700); Wang, Hui (57218646585); Peng, Junbo (57216319371); Wang, Xuncheng (57205480557); Yan, Jiye (36648275000)",NA,Belowground microbiota analysis indicates that Fusarium spp. exacerbate grapevine trunk disease,Environmental Microbiome,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,,,,NA,Belowground; Fungi; Fusarium spp; Grapevine trunk diseases; Microbiota,agar gel electrophoresis; Article; blackfoot disease; comparative study; controlled study; Convolvulus arvensis; correlational study; disease severity; DNA denaturation; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; DNA template; endophytic fungus; foot disease; fungal community; fungal plant disease; fungus isolation; Fusarium; grapevine trunk disease; human impact (environment); lateral root; mycobiome; nonhuman; pathogenicity; phytopathogen; Portulaca oleracea; Pseudogymnoascus; rhizosphere fungus; symptomatology,"Li Y., Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management on Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China, Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, 100097, China; Li X., Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management on Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China, Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, 100097, China; Zhang W., Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management on Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China, Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, 100097, China; Zhang J., Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management on Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China, Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, 100097, China, College of Plant Protection, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding, 071000, China; Wang H., Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management on Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China, Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, 100097, China; Peng J., Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management on Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China, Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, 100097, China; Wang X., Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management on Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China, Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, 100097, China; Yan J., Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management on Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China, Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, 100097, China","Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management on Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China, Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, 100097, China; College of Plant Protection, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding, 071000, China","J.

131,,"The development of endophyte inoculants for agricultural crops has been bedevilled by the twin problems of a lack of reliability and consistency, with a consequent lack of belief among end users in the efficacy of such treatments. We have developed a successful research pipeline for the production of a reliable, consistent and environmentally targeted fungal endophyte seed-delivered inoculant for barley cultivars. Our approach was developed de novo from an initial concept to source candidate endophyte inoculants from a wild relative of barley, Hordeum murinum (wall barley). A careful screening and selection procedure and extensive controlled environment testing of fungal endophyte strains, followed by multi-year field trials has resulted in the validation of an endophyte consortium suitable for barley crops grown on relatively dry sites. Our approach can be adapted for any crop or environment, provided that the set of first principles we have developed is followed.

134,,"Leaf-mining insects produce conspicuous and distinct leaf mines on various types of plant leaves. The diversity of leaf-mine morphology has typically been explained by several factors, such as selective feeding on plant tissues, improvement of microclimate, faecal disposal, reduction in the efficiency of parasitoid search behaviour and leafminer phylogeny. Although these factors are certainly associated with mining patterns, masking the mines, rather than making them conspicuous, appears to be more advantageous for deterring parasitoids and predators of leafminers. However, here, I propose that prominent leaf mines may serve to signal or cue herbivores to avoid feeding on the mined leaves. Because most leafminers are sessile and complete their development within a single leaf, herbivory of mined leaves is detrimental to leafminer survival. Other herbivores appear to avoid consuming mined leaves for a variety of reasons: leaf mines mimic leaf variegation or mottling; mined leaves induce chemical and physical defences against herbivores; and leaf mines mimic fungal infection, animal excrement, and necrosed plant tissues. Hence, natural selection may have favoured leafminers that produce conspicuous mines because of the increased survival and fecundity of thereby reducing herbivory on mined leaves.","Yamazaki, K",NA,NA,NA,"Yamazaki, Kazuo",NA,Leaf mines as visual defensive signals to herbivores,OIKOS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yamazaki, Kazuo/LGZ-7308-2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0030-1299,1600-0706,NA,NA,NA,MAY,2010,119,5,NA,NA,NA,796,801,NA,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.18300.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.18300.x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000276936000007,NA,4831,Absence

Xerophytic formations are among the most degraded ecosystems where low water availability makes reintroduction plans unsuccessful and extremely expensive. Roots inoculation with endophytic fungi has been reported as a successful strategy to maintain or improve the ecophysiological performance and survival in different species of shrubs and trees. In harsh environments, endophytes have been shown to provide benefits in terms of survival and growth for their associated vegetation. In this study, we showed that inoculation with endophytes isolated from plants growing in Antarctica improve survival and water use efficiency for irrigation on native species of xerophytic formations: Flourensia thurifera, Senna cumingii and Puya berteroniana. Overall, the presence of endophytes improved survival of all native species. Furthermore, the presence of endophytes improved water use efficiency for irrigation, reaching higher percentages of survival in plants with a reduction in the added water.

In this study, we characterize the culturable fungal and bacterial endophytes in the roots and leaves of baldcypress trees at four sites with varying levels of salinity and flooding regimes in southeastern Louisiana. Both salinity and flooding (water level) contributed to endophytic community composition of leaves and roots. We found that diversity and endophyte isolation frequency were higher in roots than in leaves, with leaf bacteria being almost negligible. Our study demonstrates a connection between environmental variables, plant symbionts, and a key restoration species.

The consortium, CATDLF5 + CATPS2 (Curvularia sp.+Bacillus pumilis), improves leaf weight in all C. roseus cultivars during winter and summer. On the alkaloids front, the consortium, CATDLF5 + CATPS2, maximally enhanced the vindoline content and yield in C. roseus cvs. Prabal and Nirmal during both winter and summer seasons; but different consortia were effective for improving vindoline content and yield in cv. Dhawal during different seasons. Whereas co-inoculation of CATDLF6 + CATPR13 (Choanephora infundibulifera + Paenibacillus sp.) and CATDLF5 + CATPS2 consortium maximally enhanced vindoline content and yield, respectively, in C. roseus cv.

139,,"This study investigated fungal endophytes in the needles of Norway spruce (Picea abies) cuttings in relation to host tree growth. We also determined the prevalence of endophytes in needles incubated for six months. The cuttings originated from clonal origins showing slow- and fast-growth in long-term field trials but the heritable differences in growth rate were not yet detected among the studied cutting. Endophytes were isolated from surface-sterilized needles with culture-free DNA techniques. No significant differences were observed between endophyte communities of slow- and fast-growing clonal origins. However, the endophyte community correlated with the current growth rate of cuttings suggesting that endophytes reflect short- rather than long-term performance of a host. The concentration of condensed tannins was similar in slow- and fast-growing clonal origins but it showed a negative relationship with endophyte species richness, implying that these secondary compounds may play an important role in spruce tolerance against fungal infections. More than a third of endophyte species were detected in both fresh and decomposing needles, indicating that many needle endophytes are facultative saprotrophs. Several potentially pathogenic fungal species were also found within the community of saprotrophic endophytes. © 2014 The British Mycological Society.",Rajala T.; Velmala S.M.; Vesala R.; Smolander A.; Pennanen T.,NA,,NA,"Rajala, Tiina (55041396000); Velmala, Sannakajsa M.

140,,"Fungal endophytes of plants are ubiquitous and important to host plant health. Wood-inhabiting and foliar endophyte communities from multiple tree hosts were sampled at multiple spatial scales across the Fushan forest dynamics plot in northern Taiwan, using culture-free, community DNA amplicon sequencing methods. Fungal endophyte communities were distinct between leaves and wood, but the mycobiomes were highly variable across and within tree species. Despite this, host tree species was an important predictor of mycobiome community-composition. Within a single common tree species, ""core"" mycobiomes were characterized using co-occurrence analysis. The spatial co-occurrence patterns of these few species of fungal endophytes appear to explain the strong host effect. For wood endophytes, a consistent core mycobiome coexisted with the host across the extent of the study. For leaf endophytes, the core fungi resembled a more dynamic, ""gradient"" model of the core microbiome, changing across the topography and distance of the study.

Influences of nursery, season (spring and autumn), host genus and plant part on those fungal assemblages have been also evaluated. Four nurseries were sampled in spring and three in autumn. Analysed material consisted of stems, roots and rhizosphere from five host species, Quercus ilex, Q. pyrenaica, Pinus pinea, P. nigra and P. sylvestris. A total of 581 isolates corresponding to 13 taxa were found in this study. Fusarium moniliforme, F. oxysporum and Trichoderma viride were the most frequently isolated fungi. Number of fungal species per observation differed significantly among the sampled parts. Multivariate Correspondence Analysis allowed the discrimination of samples in five groups based on nursery, season, host genus and plant part. Isolation frequencies of F. moniliforme and F. oxysporum were higher in the roots and in spring, whereas those of T. viride were higher in the rhizosphere and in autumn. A relationship was observed between presence of T. viride and absence of Fusarium spp. in forest nurseries.

142,,"Biotrophic fungal plant pathogens can balance their virulence and form intricate relationships with their hosts. Sometimes, this leads to systemic host colonization over long time scales without macroscopic symptoms. However, how plant-pathogenic endophytes manage to establish their sustained systemic infection remains largely unknown. Here, we present a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of Thecaphora thlaspeos. This relative of the well studied grass smut Ustilago maydis is the only smut fungus adapted to Brassicaceae hosts. Its ability to overwinter with perennial hosts and its systemic plant infection including roots are unique characteristics among smut fungi. The T. thlaspeos genome was assembled to the chromosome level. It is a typical smut genome in terms of size and genome characteristics. In silico prediction of candidate effector genes revealed common smut effector proteins and unique members. For three candidates, we have functionally demonstrated effector activity. One of these, TtTue1, suggests a potential link to cold acclimation. On the plant side, we found evidence for a typical immune response as it is present in other infection systems, despite the absence of any macroscopic symptoms during infection.

143,,"The symbiotic association of Piriformospora indica provides growth promotion leading to increased biomass as well as enhanced plant tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses in a variety of plant species. Since various protein kinases are thought to be involved in mutual signaling in symbiotic interactions, we analyzed transcript profile of rice protein kinase genes during the infection process by real-time PCR. A rice L-type lectin protein kinase (OslecRK) and Arabidopsis AtLecRK genes are highly upregulated in roots during the initial stage of symbiotic association. In order to investigate the role of LecRK gene in root colonization, the Arabidopsis mutant line (Atlecrk) of rice homolog was used which shows the restricted intracellular penetration of the P. indica hyphae. The results indicate that LecRK might be a crucial factor in perception and recognition during plant-P. indica association by regulating fungal invasion.","Nivedita; Verma, PK; Upadhyaya, KC",NA,NA,NA,"Nivedita; Verma, Praveen K.; Upadhyaya, Kailash C.",NA,"Lectin Protein Kinase Is Induced in Plant Roots in Response to the Endophytic Fungus, <i>Piriformospora indica</i>",PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTER,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Nivedita, Nivedita/JQJ-5646-2023","lal, nivedita/0000-0003-4413-1128",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0735-9640,1572-9818,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2017,35,3,NA,NA,NA,323,332,NA,10.1007/s11105-017-1024-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-017-1024-4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000402087600002,NA,8389,Absence

145,,"In orchids, most of the root-associated fungal endophytes remain undescribed as well as the drivers that affect their interactions with the plants. We characterized root-associated fungal endophytes of coexisting orchids across sites in two areas of montane rainforest in the southern Ecuadorian Andes. We amplified the nrDNA ITS2 region of 130 orchid individuals with Illumina MiSeq technology and tested whether changes in the structure of fungal communities are associated with hosts' phylogeny or the sites where the orchids grow. We identified 3492 OTUs corresponding to the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota and Zygomycota phyla. Fungal communities associated with orchids at the lower geographic areas (between 2050 and 2800 m a.s.l.) showed that host evolution and sites are drivers that could shape distinct fungal communities, while at the highest geographic areas (between 3000 and 3500 m a.s.l.), no distinct fungal communities were found neither between co-existing orchid species nor between sites. These results suggested that among orchid species, abiotic and biotic factors do not influence the composition of fungal communities in the same way.

In this study, needles were collected in Muskoka, Ontario, plated, and scored for hyphal out-growth of endophytes to observe distributional patterns. Individual trees displayed different levels of infection but branches within those trees had similar levels. There was a large difference in the infection levels between the two extant needle age-classes, with the youngest needles being virtually endophyte-free. Needles divided into four sections exhibited the most hyphal outgrowth from the distal portion and the least from the medial-proximal portion. Cultural morphotypes were primarily of the Lophodermium and Hormonema morphologies. Lophodermium occurred at all positions along the needle but Hormonema was restricted to the proximal and distal portions. Infrequently occurring fungi of diverse morphotypes were found at all four needle positions. A separate experiment compared levels of endophyte infection between Muskoka trees and trees growing in an urban area (Guelph, Ontario). Needle pieces from Guelph hosts had low rates of infection (0.02%) compared with needle pieces from Muskoka hosts (66.5%).

147,,"The inselbergs of the Central Highlands of Madagascar are one of many 'micro-hotspots' of biodiversity on the island, particularly for Orchidaceae. In this region are several genera that have a large number of endemic species that are in serious decline or edging towards extinction. Studies relating to diversity of orchids and their fungal partners (both mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal root associates) deserve more attention, as climate change and human induced decline in resilience of species in the wild is at an all-time high. Identification of mycorrhizal fungi (MF) via conventional seed baited-protocorms has limitations for large scale studies and its application for time-bound conservation projects. The paper describes the value of understanding fungal diversity in the roots of orchids at different stages of maturity. The first part of the study was a preliminary investigation mainly to identify culturable Rhizoctonia endophytes, and the second part looked at all life forms of available taxa together with associated soil characteristics. We isolated and identified 19 putative MF from 18 of the 50 taxa spread over an area of 250 sq. km, covering three life forms, growth phases of the orchid taxa, and habitat types. In the rest of the taxa, we were unable to detect any putative MF, but had varying numbers of non-mycorrhizal endophytes. We also found that diversity of putative MF was higher in plants from soils with the lowest P levels recorded. Putative mycorrhizal OTUs were predominantly from the Tulasnella lineage, followed by Ceratobasidium and Serendipita. Within a small subset of samples, a difference in colonised endophytes depending on the collection season was observed. In vitro germination studies using 10 OTUs of mycorrhizal fungi in 14 orchid species showed mostly generalist associations. When orchid seed and fungal sources were studied irrespective of habitat, life form, and distance from each other (orchid seed and fungal source), compatibility for symbiotic seed germination was observed in most cases. Issues with the identification of compatible MF and symbiotic system of seed germination are discussed.","Yokoya, K; Zettler, LW; Bell, J; Kendon, JP; Jacob, AS; Schofield, E; Rajaovelona, L; Sarasan, V",NA,NA,NA,"Yokoya, Kazutomo; Zettler, Lawrence W.; Bell, Jake; Kendon, Jonathan P.; Jacob, Alison S.; Schofield, Emily; Rajaovelona, Landy; Sarasan, Viswambharan",NA,The Diverse Assemblage of Fungal Endophytes from Orchids in Madagascar Linked to Abiotic Factors and Seasonality,DIVERSITY-BASEL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sarasan, Viswambharan/0000-0003-0297-9382; Zettler, Lawrence/0000-0002-1940-8132",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1424-2818,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2021,13,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3390/d13020096,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d13020096,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000622445000001,NA,7902,Both

M&M: Ten individuals per species were collected in August 2022. Conventional staining and techniques were used to estimate colonisation. Results: The root of Amauropelta jujuyensis, A. nubicola, and Pelazoneuron patens showed AMF with Arum and Paris morphological types simultaneously. The hyphal colonization showed no significant difference among species, arbuscular colonization was significantly higher in A. jujuyensis, while vesicular colonization was considerably higher in A. nubicola. In addition, septate endophytes were evident in the species of the genus Amauropelta. Conclusion: The association of AMF and other fungal endophytes with the native Argentine Thelypteridaceae Amauropelta jujuyensis, A. nubicola, and Pelazoneuron patens is evidenced for the first time in riparian environments of the Yungas.

149,,"The infection of grasses by systemic fungal parasites in the genus Epichloe was documented in six experimental grassland sites at Silwood Park, Berkshire, UK. The potential of insect herbivory acting as a selective agent favouring infection was investigated by comparing insecticide-treated and control plots within sites. The sites were established at different times from the colonization of bare ground and represented a range of grassland types occurring in close proximity. Five of 11 common grasses were occasionally infected by Epichloe. Holcus lanatus and H. mollis were the most frequent hosts and infection occurred primarily in the three oldest sites. Disease levels and host density were quantified by counting all healthy and diseased inflorescences in replicated one-m(2) plots at each site. Tn two of the sites where H. lanatus was the primary host disease levels were three times higher in insecticide-treated vs control plots. Holcus mollis was the primary host in the other site although visible manifestations of disease were rare. However, microscopic examinations revealed that 69% of all samples were asymptomatically infected and that infections were significantly less frequent in insecticide-treated plots.

Results revealed that the resistant genotype had higher auxin content and root plasticity, which helped in keeping the As accumulation and P starvation response to a minimum under alone As stress. However, sufficient P supply and symbiotic relationship switched the energy resources towards plant's developmental aspects rather than excessive root proliferation. Higher As accumulating genotype (GD-6) displayed upregulation of ethylene signaling/biosynthesis, root stunting and senescence related genes under As toxicity. Antioxidant defense system and cytokinin biosynthesis/signaling of both genotypes were strengthened under As + S.i + P, while the upregulation of potassium (K) and zinc (Zn) transporters depicted underlying cross-talk with iron (Fe) and P. Differential expression of phosphate transporters, peroxidases and GSTs, metal detoxification/transport proteins, as well as phytohormonal metabolism were responsible for As detoxification. Taken together, S. indica symbiosis fortified with adequate P-fertilizer can prove to be effective in minimizing As acquisition and accumulation in rice plants.","Sehar, S; Adil, MF; Askri, SMH; Feng, QD; Wei, DM; Sahito, FS; Shamsi, IH",NA,NA,NA,"Sehar, Shafaque; Adil, Muhammad Faheem; Askri, Syed Muhammad Hassan; Feng, Qidong; Wei, Dongming; Sahito, Falak Sehar; Shamsi, Imran Haider",NA,Pan-transcriptomic Profiling Demarcates <i>Serendipita Indica</i>-Phosphorus Mediated Tolerance Mechanisms in Rice Exposed to Arsenic Toxicity,RICE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wei, Dongming/AAB-4779-2020; Sehar, Shafaque/JZU-0844-2024; ASKRI, SYED MUHAMMAD HASSAN/ITU-6108-2023; Adil, Muhammad Faheem/AHE-2507-2022","Askri, Syed Muhammad Hassan/0000-0002-9104-8653; Sehar, Shafaque/0000-0003-4606-0175; Adil, Muhammad Faheem/0000-0001-5570-4433",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1939-8425,1939-8433,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2023,16,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1186/s12284-023-00645-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12284-023-00645-0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37354226,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001016887800001,NA,4566,Absence

When in situ hybridizations were performed on pine bud tissue, R. minuta was detected inside the cells of meristematic tissue in 40% of the samples, in contrast to H. dematioides, which was not found in this tissue. Using light microscopy, H. dematioides was found to be localized in the scale tissues of the buds.

The frequencies of Neotyphodium endophyte infection in Finland were investigated among and within seven Nordic cultivars of meadow fescue, Schedonorus pratensis (Huds.) P.

Frequencies of infection of cultivars varied from endophyte-free cultivar Fure to highly infected cultivar Inkeri [mean (standard deviation of mean) of 0.95 (0.023)]. Mean frequencies of infection of three cultivars remained lower than 0.10, and two of the cultivars, Kasper and Salten, were intermediately infected. In most of the cultivars, frequencies of infection varied only slightly among seed lots. In cultivar Kasper, however, the frequency of endophyte infection was highly variable (0-0.96) among the 45 seed lots examined. The relative importance of cultivar, seed lot and infection by Neotyphodium endophyte to the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi L. was studied experimentally, using both endophyte-free and endophyte-infected plants of four seed lots of the two intermediately infected cultivars. Endophyte infection increased plant resistance to R. padi, overriding the influences of seed lot and cultivar.

Nevertheless, there is a need to reexamine species delimitation in the Gloriosa taxa as most of the species have been synonymised as G. superba. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate the vegetative anatomical traits of G. superba. The leaf, scale leaf, tendril, stem, tuber, and roots of G. superba were freehand sectioned and stained with various staining solutions to record the anatomical structures. The cellular dimensions of each plant part were measured. The present study revealed the presence of intercostal and costal regions in the leaf epidermis, anomocytic stomata on abaxial surface, uniseriate epidermis covered by cuticle, undifferentiated mesophyll, and a bundle sheath surrounding vascular bundles in a leaf. Unlike the leaf, the scale leaf contains air chambers in the mesophyll region and bundle sheath is absent. The tendril had uniseriate cuticularized epidermis followed by few layers of cells developing wall thickenings, and collateral vascular bundles. The mature stem is differentiated from the young stem by the presence of bi-layered epidermis, the absence of stomata on the stem surface, and chlorenchymatous hypodermis. Air passage containing epidermis covered by thin cuticle is recorded in the stem. Starch grains are present in the tuber ground tissue. Velamen is reported for the first time in G. superba root. Scalariform perforation end plate present in root metaxylem. Roots of G. superba are colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal and dark septate endophytic fungi.

155,,"Epichloe endophytes are common symbionts living asymptomatically in pooid grasses and may provide chemical defences against herbivorous insects. While the mechanisms underlying these fungal defences have been well studied, it remains unknown whether endophyte presence affects the host's own defences. We addressed this issue by examining variation in the impact of Epichloe on constitutive and herbivore-induced emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC), a well-known indirect plant defence, between two grass species, Schedonorus phoenix (ex. Festuca arundinacea; tall fescue) and Festuca pratensis (meadow fescue). We found that feeding by a generalist aphid species, Rhopalosiphum padi, induced VOC emissions by uninfected plants of both grass species but to varying extents, while mechanical wounding failed to do so in both species after one day of damage. Interestingly, regardless of damage treatment, Epichloe uncinata-infected F. pratensis emitted significantly lower quantities of VOCs than their uninfected counterparts. In contrast, Epichloe coenophiala-infected S. phoenix did not differ from their uninfected counterparts in constitutive VOC emissions but tended to increase VOC emissions under intense aphid feeding. A multivariate analysis showed that endophyte status imposed stronger differences in VOC profiles of F. pratensis than damage treatment, while the reverse was true for S. phoenix. Additionally, both endophytes inhibited R. padi population growth as measured by aphid dry biomass, with the inhibition appearing greater in E. uncinata-infected F. pratensis. Our results suggest, not only that Epichloe endophytes may play important roles in mediating host VOC responses to herbivory, but also that the magnitude and direction of such responses may vary with the identity of the Epichloe-grass symbiosis. Whether Epichloe-mediated host VOC responses will eventually translate into effects on higher trophic levels merits future investigation.","Li, T; Blande, JD; Gundel, PE; Helander, M; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Li, Tao; Blande, James D.; Gundel, Pedro E.; Helander, Marjo; Saikkonen, Kari",NA,<i>Epichloe</i> Endophytes Alter Inducible Indirect Defences in Host Grasses,PLOS ONE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Blande, James/Q-9611-2019","Saikkonen, Kari/0000-0001-5203-9984; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Helander, Marjo/0000-0002-9759-4321; Blande, James/0000-0001-6822-0649; Li, Tao/0000-0003-1462-5135",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1932-6203,NA,NA,NA,NA,30-Jun,2014,9,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0101331,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0101331,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24978701,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000338506400118,NA,3185,Both
156,,"Fungal endophytes that colonize forest trees are widespread, but they are less well known than endophytes infecting grasses. The few studies on endophytes in trees mainly concern the tropical areas and the northernmost latitudes, while similar investigations in the Mediterranean region have so far been scarce and incidental. Endophytes are studied mostly in economically important forests suffering from diseases, such as oak forests. One common endophyte that has received some study on oak is the mitosporic Discula quercina. This paper, after first addressing some basic problems on tree endophytes, examines the ecology of D. quercina in Mediterranean oak stands. D. quercina is usually viewed as a symptomless colonizer of healthy Quercus cerris. infecting new leaves early in the growing season, in an unstable equilibrium between transient mutualism/neutralism and latent pathogenesis. It is postulated here that climatic factors can change the endophytic nature of D. quercina, turning it into a weak pathogen or an opportunistic invader of senescing and indeed healthy trees. It is argued more generally that stochastic events can cause the lifestyle of an endophyte to switch from beneficial/neutral to pathogenic, transforming the tree-endophyte interaction, an interaction that depends in part on the matching genomes of the tree and endophyte, and on the environmental context.","Moricca, S; Ragazzi, A",NA,NA,NA,"Moricca, S.; Ragazzi, A.",NA,Fungal endophytes in Mediterranean oak forests:: A lesson from <i>Discula quercina</i>,PHYTOPATHOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"moricca, salvatore/0000-0003-3097-559X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0031-949X,1943-7684,NA,NA,NA,APR,2008,98,4,NA,NA,NA,380,386,NA,10.1094/PHYTO-98-4-0380,http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-98-4-0380,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18944185,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000254310500002,NA,3788,Absence
157,,"Almost all living plants can be simultaneously colonised by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the roots and endophytes in the shoots, while also being attacked by insect herbivores. However, to date, no study has ever examined the multitrophic interactions between these two different fungal groups and insects on any species of forb. Here, we examined the effects of two commercial species mixtures of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and two foliar endophytes (Colletotrichum acutatum and Cladosporium oxysporum) on the growth of an invasive weed, Impatiens glandulifera, and the aphids that attack it. AMF reduced plant biomass, which was most evident when C. oxysporum was inoculated. Mycorrhizal fungi had few effects on aphids, and these depended on the identity of the endophytes present. Meanwhile, endophytes tended to increase aphid numbers, but this depended on the identity of the AMF inoculum. Throughout, there were differences in the responses of the plant to the two mycorrhizal mixtures, demonstrating clear AMF specificity in this plant. These specific effects were also strongly affected by the endophytes, with a greater number of interactions found between the AMF and endophytes than between the endophytes themselves. In particular, AMF reduced infection levels by the endophytes, while some endophyte inoculations reduced mycorrhizal colonisation. We suggest that both AMF and endophytes could play an important part in future biological control programmes of weeds, but further multitrophic experiments are required to unravel the complexity of interactions between spatially separated parts of the plant microbiome.","Ab Razak, N; Gange, AC",NA,NA,NA,"Ab Razak, Nadia; Gange, Alan C.",NA,"Multitrophic Interactions Between Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi, Foliar Endophytic Fungi and Aphids",MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ab Razak, Nadia/0000-0002-2278-3128",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0095-3628,1432-184X,NA,NA,NA,JAN,2023,85,1,NA,NA,NA,146,156,NA,10.1007/s00248-021-01937-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-021-01937-y,NA,Dec-21,NA,NA,NA,NA,34904179,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000729696400001,NA,647,Both

Here, we apply a novel extension of this framework to microbiota associated with aboveground tissues, termed 'plant-phyllosphere feedback (PPFs)'. In parallel greenhouse experiments, rhizosphere and phyllosphere microbiota of con-and heterospecific hosts from four species were independently manipulated. In a third experiment, we tested the combined effects of soil and phyllosphere feedback under field conditions. We found that three of four species experienced weak negative PSF whereas, in contrast, all four species experienced strong negative PPFs. Field-based feedback estimates were highly negative for all four species, though variable in magnitude. Our results suggest that phyllosphere microbiota, like rhizosphere microbiota, can potentially mediate plant species coexistence via negative feedbacks.

The presence of the Epichloe endophytes is generally beneficial to the hosts due to enhanced tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses conferred by the endophytes. Many Epichloe spp. are asexual, and those infections always remain asymptomatic. However, some Epichloe spp. have a sexual stage and produce a macroscopic fruiting body, a stroma, that envelops the developing inflorescence causing a syndrome termed ""choke disease"". Here, we report a fungal and plant gene expression analysis of choke stroma tissue and asymptomatic inflorescence tissue of Epichloefestucae-infected strong creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra subsp. rubra). Hundreds of fungal genes and over 10% of the plant genes were differentially expressed when comparing the two tissue types. The differentially expressed fungal genes in the choke stroma tissue indicated a change in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, as well as a change in expression of numerous genes for candidate effector proteins.

We used mutants impaired in ER bodies (nai1), ER body-resident myrosinases (pyk10bglu21), IG biosynthesis (myb34/51/122), and Trp specialized metabolism (cyp79b2b3) to profile their root microbiota community in natural soil, evaluate the impact of axenically collected root exudates on soil or synthetic microbial communities, and test their response to fungal endophytes in a mono-association setup. Tested mutants exhibited altered bacterial and fungal communities in rhizoplane and endosphere, respectively. Natural soils and bacterial synthetic communities treated with mutant root exudates exhibited distinctive microbial profiles from those treated with wild-type (WT) exudates. Most tested endophytes severely restricted the growth of cyp79b2b3, a part of which also impaired the growth of pyk10bglu21.

161,,"Premise: Endophytic and mycorrhizal fungi are crucial in facilitating plant nutrition acquisition and stress tolerance. In epiphytic habitats, plants face nutrition and water stress, but their roots are mostly nonmycorrhizal and especially lacking in arbuscular mycorrhizal associations. Ophioderma pendulum is an epiphytic fern with a partially mycoheterotrophic lifestyle, likely heavily reliant on symbiotic fungi. To characterize fungal associations in the sporophyte of O. pendulum, we focused on leaves and roots of O. pendulum, seeking to reveal the fungal communities in these organs. Methods: Roots and leaves from O. pendulum in a subtropical forest were examined microscopically to observe the morphology of fungal structures and determine the percentage of various fungal structures in host tissues. Fungal composition was profiled using metabarcoding techniques that targeted ITS2 of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. Results: Roots were consistently colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycota), especially Acaulospora. Unlike previous findings on epiphytic ferns, dark septate endophytes were rare in O. pendulum roots. Leaves were predominantly colonized by Ascomycota fungi, specifically the classes Dothideomycetes (46.88%), Eurotiomycetes (11.51%), Sordariomycetes (6.23%), and Leotiomycetes (6.14%). Across sampling sites, fungal community compositions were similar in the roots but differed significantly in the leaves. Conclusions: Ophioderma pendulum maintains stable, single-taxon-dominant communities in the roots, primarily featuring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, whereas the leaves may harbor opportunistic fungal colonizers. Our study underlines the significance of mycorrhizal fungi in the adaptation of epiphytic ferns.","Xie, QY; Kuo, LY; Chang, CC; Lin, CJ; Wang, WH; Chen, KH",NA,NA,NA,"Xie, Qiao-Yi; Kuo, Li-Yaung; Chang, Chiung-Chih; Lin, Chien-Jung; Wang, Wen-Hong; Chen, Ko-Hsuan",NA,Prevalent arbuscular mycorrhizae in roots and highly variable mycobiome in leaves of epiphytic subtropical fern <i>Ophioderma pendulum</i>,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Chen, Ko-Hsuan/HLQ-6649-2023","Chen, Ko-Hsuan/0000-0001-9099-9054; Wang, Wen Hong/0000-0002-1352-3260",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0002-9122,1537-2197,NA,NA,NA,2024 APR 20,2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1002/ajb2.16319,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.16319,NA,Apr-24,NA,NA,NA,NA,38641926,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001205736600001,NA,6330,Absence
162,,"The symbiosis between cool-season grasses and fungi of the genus Epichloe is widespread, but highly variable in natural ecosystems. Biotic and abiotic controls underlying its distribution patterns have been difficult to establish, but might be related to a greater capacity of infected plants to deal with drought and herbivory. In this study we examined the relationship between grazing intensity and symbiosis frequency in plant species differentially preferred by herbivores. In all the grass species found in the studied Patagonian steppe, we determined the infection frequency along a grazing gradient by sheep (ungrazed, moderate- and intense-grazing). Three out of five preferred species and one out of four non-preferred species presented the symbiosis. Within the group of species having the symbiosis, intense grazing decreased the infection frequency of the preferred species while the frequency of the non-preferred species remained constant. These changes of infection frequency were correlated with changes in tiller biomass of hosts suggesting that symbiosis frequency could depend on overall plant performance. Our results suggest that high grazing intensity could weaken the relationship between these endophytes and their palatable hosts, eventually making them even more vulnerable to further grazing.

163,,"This paper reports the use of molecular methods to characterize the coprophilous fungal communities (CFC) that inhabit the dung of four species of mammalian herbivores at two sites, Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR) in New Mexico and Wind Cave National Park (WCNP) in South Dakota. Results reveal that CFC from domesticated cattle (Bos taurus) at SNWR, and bison (Bison bison) and black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) at WCNP were diverse but dominated primarily by members within eight taxonomic orders, including the rarely cultured and anaerobic order Neocallimastigales. In addition, 7.7% (138 of 1,788) of the sequences obtained from all dung samples were at least 97% similar to root-associated fungal (RAF) sequences previously described from blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), a common forage grass found throughout North America and growing at both study sites. In contrast, 95.8% (295 of 308) of the sequences and four of the total seven operational taxonomic units obtained from pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) dung belonged to the Pleosporalean order. We hypothesize that some herbivore vectors disperse non-systemic (non-clavicipitaceous) fungal endophytes. These dispersal events, it is argued, are most likely to occur via herbivores that occasionally forage and masticate root tissue, especially in arid regions where aboveground vegetation is sparse. The results of this study suggest that some (possibly many) members of the RAF community can expand their ecological role to include colonizing dung. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Herrera J.; Poudel R.; Khidir H.H.,NA,,NA,"Herrera, José (7201650153); Poudel, Ravin (38461528100); Khidir, Hana H.

164,,"Background While a considerable amount of research has explored plant community composition in primary successional systems, little is known about the microbial communities inhabiting these pioneer plant species. Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous within plants, and may play major roles in early successional ecosystems. Specifically, endophytes have been shown to affect successional processes, as well as alter host stress tolerance and litter decomposition dynamics-both of which are important components in harsh environments where soil organic matter is still scarce. Results To determine possible contributions of fungal endophytes to plant colonization patterns, we surveyed six of the most common woody species on the Pumice Plain of Mount St. Helens (WA, USA; Lawetlat'la in the Cowlitz language; created during the 1980 eruption)-a model primary successional ecosystem-and found low colonization rates (< 15%), low species richness, and low diversity. Furthermore, while endophyte community composition did differ among woody species, we found only marginal evidence of temporal changes in community composition over a single field season (July-September). Conclusions Our results indicate that even after a post-eruption period of 40 years, foliar endophyte communities still seem to be in the early stages of community development, and that the dominant pioneer riparian species Sitka alder (Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata) and Sitka willow (Salix sitchensis) may be serving as important microbial reservoirs for incoming plant colonizers.","Wolfe, ER; Dove, R; Webster, C; Ballhorn, DJ",NA,NA,NA,"Wolfe, Emily R.; Dove, Robyn; Webster, Cassandra; Ballhorn, Daniel J.",NA,"Culturable fungal endophyte communities of primary successional plants on Mount St. Helens, WA, USA",BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wolfe, Emily/0000-0003-1808-7012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2730-7182,NA,NA,NA,15-Feb,2022,22,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1186/s12862-022-01974-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12862-022-01974-2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35168544,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000755858200001,NA,1124,Both

166,,"Plant-fungi interactions have been identified as fundamental drivers of the plant host performance, particularly in cold environments where organic matter degradation rates are slow, precisely for the capacity of the fungal symbiont to enhance the availability of labile nitrogen (N) in the plant rhizosphere. Nevertheless, these positive effects appear to be modulated by the composition and amount of the N pool in the soil, being greater when plant hosts are growing where N is scarce as is the case of Antarctic soils. Nevertheless, in some coastal areas of this continent, seabirds and marine mammal colonies exert, through their accumulated feces and urine a strong influence on the edaphic N content surrounding their aggregation points. To evaluate if the fungal symbionts (root endophytes), associated to the only two Antarctic vascular plants Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica, act as N-uptake enhancers, even in such N-rich conditions as those found around animal influence, we assessed, under controlled conditions, the process of N mineralization in soil by the accumulation of NH4+ in the rizhosphere and the biomass accumulation of plants with (E+) and without (E-) fungal symbionts. Complementarily, taking advantage of the isotopic N-fractionation that root-fungal symbionts exert on organic N molecules during its acquisition process, we also determined if endophytes actively participate in the Antarctic plants N-uptake, when inorganic N is not a limiting factor, by estimating the delta N-15 isotopic signatures in leaves. Overall, symbiotic interaction increased the availability of NH4+ in the rhizosphere of both species. As expected, the enhanced availability of inorganic N resulted in a higher final biomass in E + compared with E- plants of both species. In addition, we found that the positive role of fungal symbionts was also actively linked to the process of N-uptake in both species, evidenced by the contrasting delta N-15 signatures present in E+ (-0.4 to -2.3 parts per thousand) relative to E- plants (2.7-3.1 parts per thousand). In conclusion, despite being grown under rich N soils, the two Antarctic vascular plants showed that the presence of root-fungal endophytes, furthermore enhanced the availability of inorganic N sources in the rhizosphere, has a positive impact in their biomass, remarking the active participation of these endophytes in the N-uptake process for plants inhabiting the Antarctic continent.","Acuña-Rodríguez, IS; Galán, A; Torres-Díaz, C; Atala, C; Molina-Montenegro, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Acuna-Rodriguez, Ian S.; Galan, Alexander; Torres-Diaz, Cristian; Atala, Cristian; Molina-Montenegro, Marco A.",NA,Fungal Symbionts Enhance N-Uptake for Antarctic Plants Even in Non-N Limited Soils,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Galán, Alexander/KHD-9979-2024","Atala, Cristian/0000-0003-1337-9534; Torres Diaz, Cristian/0000-0002-5741-5288; Galan, Alexander/0000-0001-8775-0426",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-302X,NA,NA,NA,23-Oct,2020,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3389/fmicb.2020.575563,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.575563,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33193189,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000585961800001,NA,6134,Both
167,,"Epichloe spp. are symbiotic fungal endophytes of many cool season grasses. The presence of the fungal endophytes often confers insect, drought, and disease tolerance to the host grasses. The presence of the fungal endophytes within the host plants does not elicit host defense responses. The molecular basis for this phenomenon is not known. Epichloe festucae, the endophyte of Festuca rubra, expresses a salicylate hydroxylase similar to NahG from the bacterium Pseudomonas putida. Few fungal salicylate hydroxylase enzymes have been reported. The in planta expression of an endophyte salicylate hydroxylase raised the possibility that degradation of plant-produced salicylic acid is a factor in the mechanism of how the endophyte avoids eliciting host plant defenses. Here we report the characterization of the E. festucae salicylate hydroxylase, designated Efe-shyA. Although the fungal enzyme has the expected activity, based on salicylic acid levels in endophyte-free and endophyte-infected plants it is unlikely that expression of the endophyte salicylate hydroxylase is a factor in the lack of a host defense response to the presence of the fungal endophyte.","Ambrose, KV; Tian, ZP; Wang, YF; Smith, J; Zylstra, G; Huang, BR; Belanger, FC",NA,NA,NA,"Ambrose, Karen V.; Tian, Zipeng; Wang, Yifei; Smith, Jordan; Zylstra, Gerben; Huang, Bingru; Belanger, Faith C.",NA,Functional characterization of salicylate hydroxylase from the fungal endophyte <i>Epichloe festucae</i>,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wang, Yifei/M-9923-2015","Zylstra, Gerben/0000-0003-0419-1353",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2045-2322,NA,NA,NA,NA,9-Jun,2015,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1038/srep10939,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep10939,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,26055188,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000356082000001,NA,3215,Absence
168,,"Plants simultaneously associate with multiple microbial symbionts throughout their lifetimes. To address the question of whether the effects of simultaneous symbionts are contingent on the specific identities, we conducted a greenhouse experiment manipulating the presence and identities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and fungal endophytes on the shared host grass Elymus hystrix. Each plant host was inoculated with one of two AMF species having varying effects on host growth, or a sterile soil control. Further, we used naturally occurring endophyte-infected (E+) and uninfected (E) individuals from two populations of the endophyte Epichloe elymi that varied in their interaction with E. hystrix. We then measured responses of plants, AMF, and fungal endophytes. Overall, we found that the combined effects of AMF and fungal endophytes on plant growth were additive, reflecting the mutualistic quality of each symbiont independently interacting with host plants. However, fungal endophyte infection differentially altered hyphal colonization of the two AMF species and the identity of the coinfecting AMF species affected fungal endophyte fitness traits. The results of this study demonstrate that the outcome of interspecific symbiotic interactions varies with partner identity such that the effects of simultaneous symbioses can not be generalized.","Larimer, AL; Bever, JD; Clay, K",NA,NA,NA,"Larimer, Anna L.; Bever, James D.; Clay, Keith",NA,Consequences of simultaneous interactions of fungal endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi with a shared host grass,OIKOS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Clay, Keith/C-8730-2012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0030-1299,NA,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2012,121,12,NA,NA,NA,2090,2096,NA,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.20153.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.20153.x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000311390500019,NA,6255,Both
169,,"The development rate, survival and pupal weight of the armyworms Mythimna convecta and Persectania ewingii were compared after the larvae were reared on seedling or mature vegetative forms of wheat, oats and barley. No larvae of P. ewingii survived on oat seedlings, and on mature oats survival and growth rates were significantly lower than on other cereals. P. ewingii growth rates were also lower on the seedling form of barley than that of wheat. Immature development rates of M. convecta were unaffected by cereal species, although pupae grown from oats were significantly heavier. M. convecta was also tested on a number of pasture grasses. The species had maximum growth rates on barley grass (Hordeum leporinum), performed well on rye grass (Lolium perenne) (with and without the fungal endophyte Acremonium lolii) and kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum), and had significantly slower growth rates on paspalum (Paspalum dilatum) and Mitchell grass (Astrebla pectinata).

170,,"Infection with Neotyphodium spp. endophytes increases resistance to drought stress and soil mineral imbalances in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. = Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) S. J. Darbysh.) and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds. = Lolium pratense (Huds.) Darbysh.). We hypothesized that resistance of these grasses to salinity stress may also be attributed to endophyte infection. Two tall fescue genotypes, Fa75 and Fa83, and one meadow fescue genotype, Fp60, infected (E+) with their endophytic fungi, Neotyphodium coenophialum (Glenn, Bacon and Hanlin) and N. uncinatum (Glenn, Bacon and Hanlin), respectively, and their noninfected counterparts (E-) were cultured in nutrient solution at three salinity levels of 0, 85, and 170 mM NaCl. Except for genotype Fa75, E+ plants exhibited higher leaf survival rates than E-clones at a high salinity level (170 mM). Root dry matter was higher in E+ than in E-plants, but shoot dry matter was not affected by endophyte infection. This resulted in a lower shoot-to-root ratio in E+ plants (1.63) compared with E-plants (2.40). Sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) concentrations were greater in roots of E-than in E+ clones. In shoots, Na+ and Cl- concentrations were not affected by the endophyte. In contrast, E+ plants accumulated more potassium (K+), which resulted in a greater K+ : Na+ ratio in shoots of E+ than in those of E-plants. Our results show that endophyte infection reduced Na+ and Cl- concentrations in tall fescue and meadow fescue roots but increased K+ concentrations in the shoots. Based on these results, we conclude that endophyte-infected grasses may thrive better in salinity-stress environments.","Sabzalian, MR; Mirlohi, A",NA,NA,NA,"Sabzalian, Mohammad Reza; Mirlohi, Aghafakhr",NA,<i>Neotyphodium</i> endophytes trigger salt resistance in tall and meadow fescues,JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sabzalian, Mohammad R./E-6279-2013","Sabzalian, Mohammad R./0000-0002-7315-9990",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1436-8730,1522-2624,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2010,173,6,NA,NA,NA,952,957,NA,10.1002/jpln.200900345,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.200900345,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000285313700019,NA,4603,Both
171,,"Seed endophytes, as primary symbionts, may influence formation of secondary symbioses in maturing hosts. We hypothesize that such priority effects are a function of the presence and the identity of the primary symbiont, and are simulated via inoculation with primary symbionts. We sampled primary symbionts in winter wheat using culture-based techniques and next generation sequencing. Ninety-one percent of 6300 seeds had either one or no isolates. NGS data supported this with over 99% fewer reads detected in seeds having no isolates. Alternaria and Cladosporium spp., accounted for almost 80% of the primary symbionts isolated from seeds but only 36% of OTUs. Bacteria accounted for 13% of isolates but 27% of OTUs. We grew seedlings with or without primary symbiont isolates aseptically in vitro with roots in contact with a suspension of the rhizosphere symbiont Phialocephala fortinii. Seedlings having Cladosporium spp. or bacteria as primary symbionts increased the P. fortinii root colonization in 3 weeks by 30% and 50%, respectively, compared to seedlings lacking symbionts. Alternaria primary symbionts had no effect on root colonization by P. fortinii. However, Cladosporium and Alternaria inocula reduced P. fortinii colonization by 75% and 42%, respectively, at 3 weeks, so natural priority effects were not simulated by inoculation with fungi. Bacillus inoculum doubled P. fortinii colonization, but colonization was delayed. Primary symbionts of wheat seed can have strong, natural priority effects dependent on their presence and identity, but inoculation does not always simulate natural effects.","Ridout, ME; Schroeder, KL; Hunter, SS; Styer, J; Newcombe, G",NA,NA,NA,"Ridout, Mary E.; Schroeder, Kurtis L.; Hunter, Samuel S.; Styer, James; Newcombe, George",NA,Priority effects of wheat seed endophytes on a rhizosphere symbiosis,SYMBIOSIS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"JUL 15-20, 2018","Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR",Symbiosis Soc,Oregon State Univ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Schroeder, Kurtis/0000-0001-7867-4556",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0334-5114,1878-7665,NA,NA,NA,MAY,2019,78,1,NA,SI,NA,19,31,NA,10.1007/s13199-019-00606-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-019-00606-6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000469424800003,NA,6655,Absence

We attempted to advance understanding of the complex biological processes that accompany the harvest and post-harvest processing of this chemically and anatomically unique material. Here, we report changes in the fungal microbiota during the processing of Polygala tenuifolia roots, as determined by high-throughput sequencing. Our results showed that compacting the roots in airtight polyethylene bags prior to the heart removal process, which is undertaken to facilitate the heart-removal process, did not alter the fungal operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundance or composition significantly. Once the heart of the P. tenuifolia roots was discarded, the OTU counts decreased for many fungal taxa, such as endophytes, while the Penicillium increased markedly. These results can help inform provide practical guidelines for improving the storage and processing protocols used by both P. tenuifolia producers and by the TCM apothecaries who prepare and prescribe Yuanzhi.","He, L; Bai, L; Shan, LN; Yu, PH; Zhang, L; Dou, XW; Yang, MH",NA,NA,NA,"He, Liu; Bai, Ling; Shan, Linan; Yu, Penghao; Zhang, Lei; Dou, Xiaowen; Yang, Meihua",NA,"Variations in fungal microbiota and aflatoxin contamination during the processing of Yuanzhi, a traditional Chinese medicine",INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"He, Liu/GLS-1874-2022","He, Liu/0000-0003-3951-4132",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0926-6690,1872-633X,NA,NA,NA,15-Sep,2020,152,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.112509,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.112509,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000538118500024,NA,410,Absence

Molecular studies have shown that some aquatic fungi are also plant endophytes, however, more evidence is needed to evaluate their multiple ecological abilities. To date, little information is available on fungal lineages that might have undergone convergent evolution to adapt to multiple ecological modes. We examined the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary divergences of aquatic hyphomycetes, endophytic aquatic hyphomycetes and other fungal endophytes of riparian/terrestrial plants by analyzing ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequences retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Sequences with close phylogenetic affinity to aquatic fungi can occur as endophytes of terrestrial plants or in soil far from streams.

Needles colonized with the rugulosin-producing endophyte 5WS22E1 (DAOM 229536) contained rugulosin in concentrations that impaired spruce budworm growth. Here we report experimental inoculations conducted under nursery conditions. To improve the reliability of detecting successful colonization, a polyclonal assay was developed for the target endophyte 5WS22E1. It was able to reliably detect the fungus in 500 ng subsamples of colonized needles. Seventeen months post-inoculation, 330 seedlings from 1235 inoculated were colonized. A random selection of 113 colonized seedlings was analyzed for rugulosin. Needles of most (90%) contained detectable concentrations of rugulosin.

177,,"AimsPlants, fungal endophytes (FEs) and the changing environment interact with each other forming an interlaced network. This study evaluates nonadditive and interactive effects of the FE Acremonium strictum and drought treatment on Atractylodes lancea plantlets. Methods and ResultsBy applying FEs (meristem cultures of At.lancea, fungal inoculation of Ac.strictum and plantlet acclimatization) and drought treatment (regular watering, mild drought, severe drought), a research system of At.lancea ramets under different treatments was established. During 12days of drought treatment, the plantlets' physiological responses and basic growth traits were measured and analysed. Although drought and FE presence affected plantlet traits to differing degrees, the interactive effects of the two were more pronounced. In particular under mild drought treatment, the FE conferred drought tolerance to plantlets by enhancing leaf soluble sugars, proteins, proline and antioxidant enzyme activity; decreasing the degree of plasmalemma oxidation; and increasing the host's abscisic acid level and root:shoot ratio. When exposed to regular watering or severe drought, these effects were not significant. ConclusionsPlant traits plasticity was conferred by dual effects of drought stress and FEs, and these factors are interactive. Although FEs can help plants cope with drought stress, the beneficial effects are strictly constrained by drought degree. Significance and Impact of the StudyDuring finite environmental stress, FEs can benefit plants, and for this reason, they may alleviate the effects of climate change on plants. However, because the benefits of FEs are highly context dependent, the role of FEs in a changing background should be re-assessed.","Yang, T; Ma, S; Dai, CC",NA,NA,NA,"Yang, T.; Ma, S.; Dai, C.

181,,"Aphids are major pests of cereal and pasture grasses throughout the world, vectoring disease and reducing plant production. There are few control options other than insecticides. Epichloe endophytes that produce loline alkaloids in their hosts provide a possible mechanism of control, with both meadow fescue and tall fescue naturally infected with loline-producing endophytes showing a resistance to Rhopalosiphum padi. We screened Elymus spp. naturally infected with endophytes that produced loline alkaloids at concentrations known to affect aphids on fescue but found no effect on these insects infesting Elymus. A synthetic loline-producing endophyte association with rye also had no effect on the aphids. After hypothesizing that the lolines were being translocated in the xylem in Elymus and rye rather than the phloem, we tested the rye and meadow fescue infected with loline-producing endophytes against a xylem feeding spittlebug. The endophyte in rye inhibited the feeding of the insect and reduced its survival, whereas the endophyte-infected meadow fescue had no effect on the spittlebug but reduced the number of aphids. Lolines applied to the potting medium of endophyte-free and endophyte-infected rye, ryegrass, and tall fescue resulted in a decrease in the aphid populations on the endophyte-free pasture grasses relative to the untreated controls but had no effect on aphid numbers on the rye. We tentatively conclude that lolines, produced in both natural and synthetic association with Elymus and rye, are partitioned in the xylem rather than the phloem, where they are inaccessible to aphids.","Popay, AJ; Jensen, JG; Simpson, WR; Mace, WJ; Somchit, C",NA,NA,NA,"Popay, Alison J.; Jensen, Joanne G.; Simpson, Wayne R.; Mace, Wade J.; Somchit, Chanatda",NA,Translocation of Loline Alkaloids in <i>Epichloe</i>-Infected Cereal and Pasture Grasses: What the Insects Tell Us,JOURNAL OF FUNGI,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,", Joanne/KUD-4450-2024","Popay, Alison/0000-0002-0201-5308; Simpson, Wayne/0000-0003-0061-3571",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2309-608X,NA,NA,NA,JAN,2023,9,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3390/jof9010096,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof9010096,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36675917,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000914756400001,NA,878,Both
182,,"Fungal endophytes have been found in every plant species examined to date and appear to be important, but largely unquantified, components of fungal biodiversity. Endophytes are especially little known in tropical forest trees, where their abundance and diversity are thought to be greatest. Here, we explore the occurrence of endophytes in a broad diversity of woody, angiospermous taxa in a lowland, moist tropical forest in central Panama. We use similarity indices to assess host preference and spatial heterogeneity of endophytes associated with two co-occurring but distantly related, understorey tree species in two sites of that forest, and assess the utility of indices based on frequencies of morphospecies occurrence (Morisita-Horn index) and on presence-absence data (Sorensen's index). We suggest that our understanding of fungal diversity will be enhanced by exploring ecological patterns underlying endophyte occurrence in host species, and discuss methods for assessing the proportion of fungal biodiversity represented by tropical endophytes.","Arnold, AE; Maynard, Z; Gilbert, GS",NA,NA,NA,"Arnold, AE; Maynard, Z; Gilbert, GS",NA,Fungal endophytes in dicotyledonous neotropical trees: patterns of abundance and diversity,MYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"JUL 09-13, 2000","HONG KONG, PEOPLES R CHINA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0953-7562,NA,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2001,105,NA,NA,NA,NA,1502,1507,NA,10.1017/S0953756201004956,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0953756201004956,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000173613200014,NA,3716,Both
183,,"Fungal endophytes can improve plant tolerance to abiotic stress. However, the role of these plant-fungal interactions in invasive species ecology and their management implications remain unclear. This study characterized the fungal endophyte communities of native and invasive lineages of Phragmites australis and assessed the role of dark septate endophytes (DSE) in salt tolerance of this species. We used Illumina sequencing to characterize root fungal endophytes of contiguous stands of native and invasive P. australis along a salinity gradient. DSE colonization was assessed throughout the growing season in the field, and effects of fungal inoculation on salinity tolerance were investigated using laboratory and greenhouse studies. Native and invasive lineages had distinct fungal endophyte communities that shifted across the salinity gradient. DSE colonization was greater in the invasive lineage and increased with salinity. Laboratory studies showed that DSE inoculation increased P. australis seedling survival under salt stress; and a greenhouse assay revealed that the invasive lineage had higher aboveground biomass under mesohaline conditions when inoculated with a DSE. We observed that P. australis can establish mutualistic associations with DSE when subjected to salt stress. This type of plant-fungal association merits further investigation in integrated management strategies of invasive species and restoration of native Phragmites.","Mateu, MG; Baldwin, AH; Maul, JE; Yarwood, SA",NA,NA,NA,"Mateu, Martina Gonzalez; Baldwin, Andrew H.; Maul, Jude E.; Yarwood, Stephanie A.",NA,Dark septate endophyte improves salt tolerance of native and invasive lineages of <i>Phragmites australis</i>,ISME JOURNAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gonzalez Mateu, Martina/LJL-6618-2024","Gonzalez Mateu, Martina/0000-0003-4321-6875",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1751-7362,1751-7370,NA,NA,NA,AUG,2020,14,8,NA,NA,NA,1943,1954,NA,10.1038/s41396-020-0654-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41396-020-0654-y,NA,Apr-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,32341473,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000528998300001,NA,3694,Both

Bromeliads explore highly stressful habitats and root-associated fungi may play a crucial role in this, but the driving factors and variations in root-associated fungi remain largely unknown. We explored root-associated fungal communities in 17 bromeliad species and their variations linked to host identity, life forms and nutritional modes by using ITS1 gene-based high-throughput sequencing and by characterizing fungal functional guilds. We found a dual association of mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal fungi. The different species, life forms and nutritional modes among bromeliad hosts had fungal communities that differ in their taxonomic and functional composition. Specifically, roots of epiphytic bromeliads had more endophytic fungi and dark septate endophytes and fewer mycorrhizal fungi than terrestrial bromeliads and lithophytes. Our results contribute to a fundamental knowledge base on different fungal groups in previously undescribed Bromeliaceae. The diverse root-associated fungal communities in bromeliads may enhance plant fitness in both stressful and nutrient-poor environments and may give more flexibility to the plants to adapt to changing environmental conditions.","Leroy, C; Maes, AQ; Louisanna, E; Schimann, H; Séjalon-Delmas, N",NA,NA,NA,"Leroy, Celine; Maes, Arthur QuyManh; Louisanna, Eliane; Schimann, Heidy; Sejalon-Delmas, Nathalie",NA,"Taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity of root-associated fungi in bromeliads: effects of host identity, life forms and nutritional modes",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Schimann, Heidy/AAN-5252-2020","Sejalon-Delmas, Nathalie/0000-0003-4453-3864; Schimann, Heidy/0000-0002-9139-920X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0028-646X,1469-8137,NA,NA,NA,AUG,2021,231,3,NA,NA,NA,1195,1209,NA,10.1111/nph.17288,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.17288,NA,Jun-21,NA,NA,NA,NA,33605460,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000657838000001,NA,1572,Both
185,,"Phosphate deprivation compromises plant productivity and modulates immunity. DAMP signalling by extracellular ATP (eATP) could be compromised under phosphate deprivation by the lowered production of cytosolic ATP and the need to salvage eATP as a nutritional phosphate source. Phosphate-starved roots of Arabidopsis can still sense eATP, indicating robustness in receptor function. However, the resultant cytosolic free Ca2+ signature is impaired, indicating modulation of downstream components. This perspective on DAMP signalling by extracellular ATP (eATP) addresses the salvage of eATP under phosphate deprivation and its promotion of immunity, how Ca2+ signals are generated and how the Ca2+ signalling pathway could be overcome to allow beneficial fungal root colonization to fulfill phosphate demands. Safe passage for an endophytic fungus allowing root colonization could be achieved by its down-regulation of the Ca2+ channels that act downstream of the eATP receptors and by also preventing ROS accumulation, thus further impairing DAMP signalling.","Matthus, E; Ning, YZ; Shafiq, F; Davies, JM",NA,NA,NA,"Matthus, Elsa; Ning, Youzheng; Shafiq, Fahad; Davies, Julia M.",NA,Phosphate-deprivation and damage signalling by extracellular ATP,FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ning, Youzheng/LBH-5163-2024; Shafiq, Fahad/H-4519-2019","Shafiq, Fahad/0000-0003-2183-2714",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-462X,NA,NA,NA,NA,12-Jan,2023,13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3389/fpls.2022.1098146,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.1098146,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36714742,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000920689000001,NA,5880,Absence
186,,"The transition from mother plant seed production to seedlings recruitment is critical for annual plant species but also for vertically transmitted microbial symbionts. Evidence indicates that microbial symbionts play important roles in plant response to environmental changes. However, their role in plant facing gaseous tropospheric pollutants such as the highly reactive and phytotoxic ozone, have been scarcely studied. Here, we experimentally tested the consequences of maternal plant exposure to ozone on the longevity of Lohum mutiflontm seeds mediated by a vertically-transmitted fungal endophyte (Epichloe occultans). Seeds were produced by mother plants exposed to contrasting levels of ozone (low and high concentrations) in two phases of the life cycle (vegetative and reproductive). We first characterized the consequences of plant exposure to ozone on the state of the antioxidant glutathione in the seeds. Then, we examined viability dynamics of the seeds through an accelerated ageing trial and followed the physiological variables seed water content (SWC) and electrical conductivity (EC). Irrespectively of maternal ozone, seeds produced by endophyte-symbiotic plants presented higher contents of the oxidised form of glutathione. In the same direction, the fungal endophyte presence was associated with a dramatic reduction in seed longevity. The SWC was higher in endophyte-symbiotic seeds that in endophyte-free seeds. As time under accelerated ageing condition advanced, EC increased more in endophytesymbiotic seeds than in endophyte-free seeds. Mother plant exposure to ozone tended to have a negative synergistic effect with the endophyte symbiosis. Ozone transgenerational effect was not detected on endophyte-free seeds.

In contrast, a high level of variation was exhibited in the outcrossing Miscanthus sinensis var. glaber (Nakai) Li. In addition to apomictic reproduction, low genetic variation across populations of M. sinensis var. condensatus may be a result of high salinity acting as a selective agent.

191,,"The use of chemicals to fertilize crops incurs economic and environmental costs and it is widely recognized that the current level of chemical fertilizer use is unsustainable in many intensive farming systems. Any methods that can reduce fertilizer input and still maintain acceptable yields would be of great benefit to both the farmer and the environment. The use of beneficial endophytes as crop inoculants may go some way towards improving crop yields beyond that achievable using fertilizer increases alone. Field trials were conducted over two seasons on three contrasting field sites to test the effects of fungal endophytes from a wild barley relative on three barley cultivars (Mickle, Planet and Propino). Seeds were either untreated or dressed with a consortium of four endophyte strains, and three levels of nitrogen (N) were applied to both treatments: full N, 50% N and 0 N. On the field site with the lowest overall N input, the endophyte treatment with 50% N restored yield for Planet' to that associated with untreated plants receiving the full N input. On the same site and with the same cultivar, endophyte treatment increased yield by 15% under full N, and by a mean 12% for all three cultivars with 50% N input. Over both seasons and all three sites, the endophyte treatment increased yield for the cultivar Planet by a mean of 9%. For the endophyte-associated increase in the variety Planet grain yield over the untreated trials strong correlations were found between increased yield and each of low rainfall, greater evaporation and greater number of degree days above the base. Furthermore, the efficacy of the endophytes was not removed by regular foliar fungicidal treatment.

192,,"Fungal endophytes inhabit healthy tissues of all terrestrial plant taxa studied to date and arc diverse and abundant in leaves of tropical woody angiosperms. Studies have demonstrated that plant location and leaf age influence density of endophyte infection in leaves of tropical forest trees. However, ecological factors underlying these observations have not been explored in detail. Here, we establish that foliar endophytes of a tropical tree (Theobroma cacao, Malvaceae) are transmitted horizontally and that endophyte-free seedlings can be produced for experimental manipulation by protecting aerial tissues from surface wetting. At Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we used transects of endophyte-free seedlings to determine the importance of several factors (canopy cover, abundance of aerial and epiphytic propagules, leaf age, leaf chemistry, leaf toughness and duration of exposure to viable air spora) in shaping colonization by endophytic fungi. Endophytes colonized leaves of T cacao more rapidly beneath the forest canopy than in cleared sites, reflecting local abundance of aerial and epiphytic propagules. The duration of exposure, rather than absolute leaf age, influenced endophyte infection, whereas leaf toughness and chemistry had no observed effect. Endophytes isolated from mature T cacao grew more rapidly on media containing leaf extracts of T cacao than on media containing extracts from other co-occurring tree species, suggesting that interspecific differences in leaf chemistry influence endophyte assemblages. Together, these data allow us to identify factors underlying patterns of endophyte colonization within healthy leaves of this tropical tree.","Arnold, AE; Herre, EA",NA,NA,NA,"Arnold, AE; Herre, EA",NA,Canopy cover and leaf age affect colonization by tropical fungal endophytes:: Ecological pattern and process in <i>Theobroma cacao</i> (Malvaceae),MYCOLOGIA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0027-5514,1557-2536,NA,NA,NA,MAY-JUN,2003,95,3,NA,NA,NA,388,398,NA,10.2307/3761880,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3761880,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,21156627,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000184393800002,NA,3737,Both
193,,"Reports of allelopathy by tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) on Trifolium species are inconsistent. Many tall fescue plants are infected with a fungal endophyte (Acremonium coenophialum Morgan-Jones & Gams), which may account for some of the inconsistencies. My objective was to investigate the allelopathic effect of extracts of endophyte-free (TF-E) and -infected (TF+E) tall fescue seeds on the seed germination and seedling growth (shoot, root, and root-hair length and root-hair density) of five Trifolium species (ball clover, T. nigrescens Viv.; crimson clover, T. incarnatum L.; red clover, T. pratense L.; subterranean clover, T. subterraneum L.; and white clover, T. repens L.). Extracts were prepared by passing 50 g of seed through a pulverizing mill, soaking the milled seed in 500 mL of deionized water, filtering, and sterilizing the solution. Differences among allelopathic effects for seed germination were attributed to legume species. Although the presence of fungal endophyte had no effect on seed germination, germination of hall, crimson, and red clover seed was significantly reduced in extracts of tall fescue seed. Differences among allelopathic effects for shoot and root lengths were attributed to legume species. Seedling shoot length was significantly increased and root length was significantly decreased for clover seedlings grown in tall fescue extracts. Differences among allelopathic effects for Foot-hair length and density were attributed to species and substrate (TF-E vs. TF+E) differences. There was a 34% reduction in root-hair length and a 45% reduction in root-hair density for clover seedlings grown in seed extracts compared with seedlings grown in water. Seed germination and seedling shoot and root lengths inadequately expressed the subtle allelopathic effects of the fungal endophyte. Micromorphological characters, such as root hairs, may be more sensitive in detecting allelopathic effects.","Springer, TL",NA,,NA,"Springer, TL",NA,Allelopathic effects on germination and seedling growth of clovers by endophyte-free and -infected tall fescue,CROP SCIENCE,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,,,,NA,,Festuca; Gomphrena nitida; Neotyphodium coenophialum; Schedonorus arundinaceus; Trifolium; Trifolium incarnatum; Trifolium nigrescens; Trifolium pratense; Trifolium repens; Trifolium subterraneum,"Springer T.L., USDA-ARS, S.

194,,"Symbiotic infection with fungal endophytes has been shown to decrease herbivory in several temperate grasses. We tested the hypothesis that foliar endophytes of grasses may also affect below-ground processes upon their host death, by altering the litter quality for detritivores or the microenvironment for decomposition. Microcosm-litterbag experiments were used to assess decay rates for litter produced by endophyte (Neotyphodium sp.) infected vs uninfected Lolium multiflorum plants, and to examine endophyte-mediated effects of prior site occupants on current litter decomposition. We found that litter from endophyte-infected L. multiflorum decomposed more slowly than litter from endophyte-free conspecifics and from a naturally uninfected grass, Bromus unioloides. Furthermore, the endophyte-grass association modified the decomposition environment, so that B. unioloides litter decomposed faster when placed underneath a thick layer of endophyte-free L. multiflorum litter. Litter decay rates increased with the amount of root debris remaining in situ from the previous season, but were not affected by the infection status of prior site occupants. The lower decomposability of litter from infected L. multiflorum plants persisted across a range of microenvironments, as determined by different amounts of above-ground litter and soil moisture conditions. Endophyte infection tended to reduce the N content of decaying litter; however, litter N and C/N ratio mainly accounted for interspecific differences in decomposition. Our results imply that fungal endophytes not only can affect herbivory food chains, but also soil organisms and the ecosystem processes they regulate. This study suggests a novel role for symbiotic foliar endophytes in linking above-ground and below-ground sub-systems.","Omacini, M; Chaneton, EJ; Ghersa, CM; Otero, P",NA,NA,NA,"Omacini, M; Chaneton, EJ; Ghersa, CM; Otero, P",NA,Do foliar endophytes affect grass litter decomposition?: A microcosm approach using <i>Lolium multiflorum</i>,OIKOS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Omacini, Marina/0000-0003-1460-262X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0030-1299,1600-0706,NA,NA,NA,MAR,2004,104,3,NA,NA,NA,581,590,NA,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12915.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12915.x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000189023900017,NA,7059,Both

In this study, germination percentage of A. inebrians seeds infected with Epichloeeurogansuensis and non-infected seeds were tested under five salinity concentrations (100 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM, 400 mM and 500 mM) and five water pH levels (pH = 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) with distilled water (pH = 6.5) as a control. These treatments were carried out in the presence of constant temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C) under constant light exposure and alternating temperatures (15/5, 20/10, 25/15, 30/20 and 35/25 degrees C) for 12 h light: 12 h dark photoperiod. Germination percentage was calculated after 14 days of incubation under these programmed conditions. Increase in salinity resulted in a gradual decrease in germination percentage while increase in pH up to 7 resulted in increased germination. Germination of endophyte infected and non-infected seeds were increased at 20 degrees C and 25/15 degrees C for constant light and 12:12 h photoperiod. Endophyte infected seeds were found to exhibit the most significant results as compared to non-infected seeds under varying range of salinity, pH, light, photoperiod and temperature indicating that endophyte infection in A. inebrians seeds increased the germination percentage and survival of seeds with the ability to tolerate stress condition.

196,,"In the last decade, there has been an increasing focus on the implementation of plant growth-promoting (PGP) organisms as a sustainable option to compensate for poor soil fertility conditions in developing countries. Trap systems were used in an effort to isolate PGP fungi from rhizospheric soil samples collected in the region around Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of Congo. With sudangrass as a host, a highly conducive environment was created for sebacinalean chlamydospore formation inside the plant roots resulting in a collection of 51 axenically cultured isolates of the elusive genus Piriformospora (recently transferred to the genus Serendipita). Based on morphological data, ISSR fingerprinting profiles and marker gene sequences, we propose that these isolates together with Piriformospora williamsii constitute a species complex designated Piriformospora (= Serendipita) 'williamsii.' A selection of isolates strongly promoted plant growth of in vitro inoculated Arabidopsis seedlings, which was evidenced by an increase in shoot fresh weight and a strong stimulation of lateral root formation. This isolate collection provides unprecedented opportunities for fundamental as well as translational research on the Serendipitaceae, a family of fungal endophytes in full expansion.","Venneman, J; Audenaert, K; Verwaeren, J; Baert, G; Boeckx, P; Moango, AM; Dhed'a, BD; Vereecke, D; Haesaert, G",NA,NA,NA,"Venneman, Jolien; Audenaert, Kris; Verwaeren, Jan; Baert, Geert; Boeckx, Pascal; Moango, Adrien M.; Dhed'a, Benoit D.; Vereecke, Danny; Haesaert, Geert",NA,Congolese Rhizospheric Soils as a Rich Source of New Plant Growth-Promoting Endophytic <i>Piriformospora</i> Isolates,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Vereecke, Danny/KFS-1222-2024","Venneman, Jolien/0000-0002-9791-8816; Audenaert, Kris/0000-0002-8791-1282; Haesaert, Geert/0000-0003-2993-9858; Vereecke, Danny/0000-0003-3706-780X; Verwaeren, Jan/0000-0001-9978-501X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-302X,NA,NA,NA,14-Feb,2017,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3389/fmicb.2017.00212,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.00212,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28261171,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000393839000001,NA,4400,Absence

198,,"Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) is a very common grass species with a wide distribution, including in Mediterranean areas. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of non-clavicipitaceous fungal endophytes on forage production by P. pratensis, and on the nutritive value and mineral status of its herbage. Plants were inoculated with each of eight endophytic species and grown under greenhouse conditions. After 3 months, the plants were harvested and dried before evaluating the following parameters: dry mass of herbage and roots, crude protein content, neutral detergent fibre content, and mineral contents in herbage. The results showed that endophytes affected the biomass yield (herbage and roots), fibre content, and mineral contents in the forage. Compared with controls, plants inoculated with Stemphylium globuliferum showed the highest herbage and root biomass values, whilst those inoculated with Embellisia leptinellae and S. globuliferum showed reduced fibre contents in herbage. Plants infected with Epicoccum nigrum and S. globuliferum showed increased herbage concentrations of calcium, magnesium, molybdenum, and titanium. These results demonstrate that inoculation of Poa pratensis with endophytes can increase its biomass yield and the nutritive value of its herbage. Therefore, endophyte inoculation may be a useful strategy to reduce nutrient deficiencies in P. pratensis forage.","Lledó, S; Rodrigo, S; Poblaciones, MJ; Santamaria, O",NA,NA,NA,"Lledo, Santiago; Rodrigo, Sara; Poblaciones, Maria J.; Santamaria, Oscar",NA,"Biomass yield, mineral content, and nutritive value of <i>Poa pratensis</i> as affected by non-clavicipitaceous fungal endophytes",MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"rodrigo, sara/L-6541-2014; Poblaciones, Maria/AAA-6673-2019; Santamaria, Oscar/L-8979-2014; Poblaciones, Maria J/K-5106-2014","Santamaria, Oscar/0000-0001-5087-6519; rodrigo, sara/0000-0002-2807-4912; Poblaciones, Maria J/0000-0002-1559-2382",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1617-416X,1861-8952,NA,NA,NA,SEP,2015,14,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1007/s11557-015-1093-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-015-1093-4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000361001200007,NA,4777,Both
199,,"This paper elaborates the advances made in the study of morphology, phylogeny, host association and geography of novel and interesting fungi in China and Thailand. We documented saprobic microfungi from dead twigs of different plant hosts from Annonaceae (Anomianthus dulcis, Cananga odorata and Desmos chinensis), Apocynaceae (Alstonia scholaris) and Magnoliaceae (Magnolia champaca, M. garrettii and M. liliifera) in Yunnan Province, China and northern Thailand. Descriptions, illustrations and discussions on the familial placement of taxa are given based on phylogeny and morphological data. One new genus Muriformispora in Neohendersoniaceae (Dothideomycetes) and twelve new species, Acrocalymma magnoliae, Diaporthe chiangmaiensis, Fuscostagonospora magnoliae, Gyrothrix anomianthi, Hermatomyces anomianthi, Muriformispora magnoliae, Neomassaria alstoniae, N. thailandica, Neoroussoella thailandica, Peroneutypa anomianthi, Pseudochaetosphaeronema magnoliae and Torula canangae are introduced. An amended account of Hermatomyces is provided to include the sexual morph of the genus. New host records or new country records are provided for Acrocalymma pterocarpi, A. walkeri, Amphisphaeria micheliae, Angustimassarina populi, Aurantiascoma minimum, Diaporthe musigena, D. pterocarpi, Eutypella citricola, Gyrothrix oleae, Hermatomyces sphaericus, Lasiodiplodia crassispora, L. exigua, L. ponkanicola, L. pseudotheobromae, L. thailandica, L. theobromae, Magnibotryascoma kunmingense, Memnoniella ellipsoidea, Melomastia clematidis, M. thamplaensis, Neoroussoella entadae, Nectria pseudotrichia, Nigrograna thymi, Periconia byssoides, P. pseudobyssoides, Phaeosphaeria sinensis, Pseudopithomyces chartarum, Pseudofusicoccum adansoniae, Rhytidhysteron neorufulum, Setoapiospora thailandica and Xenoroussoella triseptata.","de Silva, NI; Hyde, KD; Lumyong, S; Phillips, AJL; Bhat, DJ; Maharachchikumbura, SSN; Thambugala, KM; Tennakoon, DS; Suwannarach, N; Karunarathna, SC",NA,NA,NA,"de Silva, N., I; Hyde, K.

200,,"A large literature concerns the epidemiology of single pathogens on single hosts. Yet in some environmental applications,such as fungal pathogens of forest tree seedlings,the ""one host-one pathogen"" paradigm may not be applicable. Multiple potential pathogens are often found in a single individual and/or multiple hosts share the same pathogens. Understanding diversity requires techniques to infer how multiple pathogens might regulate multiple hosts and to predict how imp acts might vary with the environment. Here we present a hierarchical framework for the case where there is detection information based on multiple sources(cultures, gene sequencing,and survival observations),and the inference problem includes not only parameters that describe environmental influences on pathogen incidence infection, and host survival, but also on latent states themselves-pathogen incidence at a site and infection statuses of hosts. Due to the large size of the model space, we develop a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to select models, estimate posterior distributions, and predict environmental influences on host survival. we demonstrate with application to a data set involving fungal pathogens on tree hosts,where data include host survival and fungal detection using cultures and DNA sequencing.","Clark, JS; Hersh, MH",NA,NA,NA,"Clark, James S.; Hersh, Michelle H.",NA,"Inference in incidence, infection, and impact: Co-infection of multiple hosts by multiple pathogens",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hersh, Michelle/D-2079-2009; Clark, James/G-6331-2011","Hersh, Michelle/0000-0003-1174-7575",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1931-6690,1936-0975,NA,NA,NA,NA,2009,4,2,NA,NA,NA,337,365,NA,10.1214/09-BA413,http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/09-BA413,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000273483400010,NA,167,Absence
