533,"Other","Cadmium (Cd) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) are frequently detected in agricultural soils, which poses a threat to public health. This study investigated the effects of inoculation of king grass with Piriformospora indica on the remediation of soils co-contaminated with Cd and DDTs. After treatment for 90 days, the dry shoot and root biomass of king grass inoculated with P. indica markedly increased by 13.0-15.8% and 24.1-46.4%, respectively, compared with those of uninoculated plants. Inoculation with P. indica also increased the uptake of Cd and DDTs by shoots and roots of king grass. The removal efficiency of Cd and DDTs from soils reached 4.88-17.4% and 48.4-51.0%, respectively, in the presence of king grass inoculated with P. indica. Under three Cd-DDTs contamination conditions, root secretion of organic acids, alcohol, and polyamines was distinctively stimulated by P. indica inoculation of king grass compared with planting king grass alone. After phytor-emediation, changes in soil bacterial and fungal community composition occurred at different contamination levels. Overall, the results showed that king grass associated with P. indica can be adopted for phytoextraction of Cd and DDTs from moderately contaminated soils by regulating root excretion and reshaping rhizosphere mi-crobial community structure.","Li, D; Zheng, XX; Lin, L; An, QL; Jiao, YQ; Li, QL; Li, ZD; Hong, Y; Zhang, KL; Xie, C; Yin, J; Zhang, HX; Wang, BJ; Hu, YM; Zhu, ZQ",NA,NA,NA,"Li, Dong; Zheng, Xiaoxiao; Lin, Li; An, Qianli; Jiao, Yangqiu; Li, Qiuli; Li, Zhidong; Hong, Yi; Zhang, Kailu; Xie, Can; Yin, Jing; Zhang, Haixiang; Wang, Baijie; Hu, Yueming; Zhu, Zhiqiang",NA,"Remediation of soils co-contaminated with cadmium and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes by king grass associated with<i> Piriformospora</i><i> indica:</i> Insights into the regulation of root excretion and reshaping of rhizosphere microbial community structure","JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lin, lirong/C-1953-2008; An, Qianli/D-5321-2015",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0304-3894","1873-3336",NA,NA,NA,"15-Jan",2022,422,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126936","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126936",NA,"21-Aug",NA,NA,NA,NA,34463272,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000709306900001",NA,408,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA

535,"Other","DNA fingerprinting using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers was employed to investigate the genetic variation within and among populations of Miscanthus Anderss. sinensis var. condensatus (Hack.) Makino, an apomictic grass distributed along the coasts of Taiwan and Ryukyu Islands. A total of 250 plants from three Taiwanese populations (Southeast Coast, Orchid Islet, and Green Islet) and two populations from Ryukyu (Ishigaki and Amami-O-Shima Islets) were sampled. The amplified products of 40 random primers showed monomorphic banding patterns within all populations as well as among the three populations from Taiwan. Low genetic variation (with only two polymorphic loci), but significant differentiation, was detected between populations from Taiwan and Ryukyu (φCT = 0.864) and between populations (φST= 1.0) from lshigaki and Amami-O-Shima Islets. In contrast, a high level of variation was exhibited in the outcrossing Miscanthus sinensis var. glaber (Nakai) Li. In addition to apomictic reproduction, low genetic variation across populations of M. sinensis var. condensatus may be a result of high salinity acting as a selective agent. With the cost of reduced genetic heterogeneity, apomixis may have provided a mechanism for avoiding the transmission of endophytic fungi. The phytogeographic pattern of M. sinensis var. condensatus, as reflected by the RAPD data, likely represents isolation between Taiwan and Ryukyu since the mid-Pleistocene.","Chou C.-H.; Chiang Y.-C.; Chiang T.-Y.",NA,"",NA,"Chou, C.-H.

537,"Other","Air pollution caused by tropospheric ozone contributes to the decline of forest ecosystems; for instance, sacred fir, Abies religiosa (Kunth) Schltdl. & Cham. forests in the peri-urban region of Mexico City. Individual trees within these forests exhibit variation in their response to ozone exposure, including the severity of visible symptoms in needles. Using RNA-Seq metatranscriptomic data and ITS2 metabarcoding, we investigated whether symptom variation correlates with the taxonomic and functional composition of fungal mycobiomes from needles collected in this highly polluted area in the surroundings of Mexico City. Our findings indicate that ozone-related symptoms do not significantly correlate with changes in the taxonomic composition of fungal mycobiomes. However, genes coding for 30 putative proteins were differentially expressed in the mycobiome of asymptomatic needles, including eight genes previously associated with resistance to oxidative stress. These results suggest that fungal communities likely play a role in mitigating the oxidative burst caused by tropospheric ozone in sacred fir. Our study illustrates the feasibility of using RNA-Seq data, accessible from global sequence repositories, for the characterization of fungal communities associated with plant tissues, including their gene expression.","Flores-Almaraz, VS; Truong, C; Hernández-Oaxaca, D; Reyes-Galindo, V; Mastretta-Yanes, A; Jaramillo-Correa, JP; Salas-Lizana, R",NA,NA,NA,"Flores-Almaraz, Valeria Stephany; Truong, Camille; Hernandez-Oaxaca, Diana; Reyes-Galindo, Veronica; Mastretta-Yanes, Alicia; Jaramillo-Correa, Juan Pablo; Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo",NA,"Foliar mycobiome remains unaltered under urban air-pollution but differentially express stress-related genes","MICROBIAL ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mastretta, Alicia/KTI-1558-2024; Truong, Camille/R-7670-2019; Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo/LCL-2439-2024","Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo/0000-0002-0761-2910; Reyes-Galindo, Veronica/0000-0003-0688-2203; Mastretta-Yanes, Alicia/0000-0003-2951-6353; Jaramillo-Correa, Juan P./0000-0001-7617-913X; Hernandez Oaxaca, Diana/0000-0001-6218-8297; Truong, Camille/0000-0002-8510-1761; Flores Almaraz, Valeria/0009-0003-8601-8462",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0095-3628","1432-184X",NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2024,87,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1007/s00248-024-02387-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-024-02387-y",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38755460,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001227211200001",NA,412,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA
538,"Other","Extraneous DNA interferes with PCR studies of endophytic fungi. A procedure was developed with which to evaluate the removal of extraneous DNA. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) leaves were sprayed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and then subjected to physical and chemical surface treatments. The fungal ITS1 products were amplified from whole tissue DNA extractions. ANOVA was performed on the DNA bands representing S. cerevisiae on the agarose gel. Band profile comparisons using permutational multivariate ANOVA (PERMANOVA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) were performed on DGGE gel data, and band numbers were compared between treatments. Leaf surfaces were viewed under variable pressure scanning electron microscopy (VPSEM). Yeast band analysis of the agarose gel showed that there was no significant difference in the mean band DNA quantity after physical and chemical treatments, but they both differed significantly (p < 0.05) from the untreated control. PERMANOVA revealed a significant difference between all treatments (p < 0.05). The mean similarity matrix showed that the physical treatment results were more reproducible than those from the chemical treatment results. The NMDS showed that the physical treatment was the most consistent. VPSEM indicated that the physical treatment was the most effective treatment to remove surface microbes and debris. The use of molecular and microscopy methods for the post-treatment detection of yeast inoculated onto wheat leaf surfaces demonstrated the effectiveness of the surface treatment employed, and this can assist researchers in optimizing their surface sterilization techniques in DNA-based fungal endophyte studies. © 2014, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.","Burgdorf R.J.; Laing M.D.; Morris C.D.; Jamal-Ally S.F.",NA,"",NA,"Burgdorf, R.J.

539,"Other","Considering the potential threat of vegetables growing in antibiotic-polluted soil with high abundance of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) against human health through the food chain, it is thus urgent to develop novel control technology to ensure vegetable safety. In the present work, pot experiments were conducted in lettuce cultivation to assess the impedance effect of biochar amendment on soil sulfonamides (SAs), antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), and ARG enrichment in lettuce tissues. After 100 days of cultivation, lettuce cultivation with biochar amendment exhibited the greatest soil SA dissipation as well as the significant improvement of lettuce growth indices, with residual soil SAs mainly existing as the tightly bound fraction. Moreover, the SA contents in roots and new/old leaves were reduced by one to two orders of magnitude compared to those without biochar amendment. In addition, isolate counts for SA-resistant bacterial endophytes in old leaves and sul gene abundances in roots and old leaves also decreased significantly after biochar application. However, neither SA resistant bacteria nor sul genes were detected in new leaves. It was the first study to demonstrate that biochar amendment can be a practical strategy to protect lettuce safety growing in SA-polluted soil with rich ARB and ARGs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Ye M.; Sun M.; Feng Y.; Wan J.; Xie S.; Tian D.; Zhao Y.; Wu J.; Hu F.; Li H.; Jiang X.",NA,"",NA,"Ye, Mao (57200130221); Sun, Mingming (36088000900); Feng, Yanfang (54386661100); Wan, Jinzhong (16319864300); Xie, Shanni (56927338200); Tian, Da (56717191800); Zhao, Yu (59050815500); Wu, Jun (57203272581); Hu, Feng (7202526324); Li, Huixin (8542795700); Jiang, Xin (57214068210)",NA,"Effect of biochar amendment on the control of soil sulfonamides, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and gene enrichment in lettuce tissues","Journal of Hazardous Materials",NA,NA,"English","Article",NA,"","","",NA,"ARB; ARGs; Biochar addition; Impedance effect; Lettuce cultivation","Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Charcoal; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Food Contamination; Genes, Bacterial; Lettuce; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants; Sulfonamides; Bacteria (microorganisms); Lactuca; Amides; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Bacteriology; Cultivation; Genes; Health risks; Histology; Soil pollution; Sulfur compounds; Tissue; Vegetables; biochar; charcoal; RNA 16S; sulfonamide; unclassified drug; vegetable protein; antiinfective agent; bacterial RNA; biochar; charcoal; soil pollutant; sulfonamide; Antibiotic-resistant bacteria; Antibiotic-resistant genes; ARGs; Bacterial endophytes; Bio chars; Control technologies; Orders of magnitude; Resistant bacteria; antibiotic resistance; bacterium; charcoal; cultivation; drug; gene; growth rate; leaf; leafy vegetable; residual soil; root system; soil amendment; antibiotic resistant bacteria; antibiotic resistant gene; Article; bacterial gene; bioaccumulation; bound fraction; chemical composition; chlorophyll content; concentration (parameters); controlled study; dry weight; endophyte; endophytic fungus; fresh weight; gene dosage; genetic analysis; lettuce; nonhuman; plant growth; plant leaf; plant root; plant tissue; root growth; soil amendment; soil property; surface area; antibiotic resistance; bacterial gene; bacterium; chemistry; food contamination; genetics; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; prevention and control; soil pollutant; Soils","Ye M., State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, China; Sun M., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Feng Y., Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, 210014, China; Wan J., Nanjing Institute of Environmental Science, Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, Nanjing, 210042, China; Xie S., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Tian D., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Zhao Y., Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Photonic and Electronic Materials, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China; Wu J., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Hu F., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Li H., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Jiang X., State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, China","State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, China; Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, 210014, China; Nanjing Institute of Environmental Science, Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, Nanjing, 210042, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Photonic and Electronic Materials, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China","Y.

541,"Other","Neotyphodium endophytic fungi, the asexual state of Epichloe species, protect cool-season grasses against stresses. The outcomes of Neotyphodium-grass symbioses are agronomically relevant as they may affect the productivity of pastures. It has been suggested that the mutualism is characteristic of agronomic grasses and that differential rates of gene flow between both partners' populations are expected to disrupt the specificity of the association and, thus, the mutualism in wild grasses. We propose that compatibility is necessary but not sufficient to explain the outcomes of Neotyphodium-grass symbiosis, and advance a model that links genetic compatibility, mutualism effectiveness, and endophyte transmission efficiency. For endophytes that reproduce clonally and depend on allogamous hosts for reproduction and dissemination, we propose that this symbiosis works as an integrated entity where gene flow promotes its fitness and evolution. Compatibility between the host plant and the fungal endophyte would be high in genetically close parents; however, mutualism effectiveness and transmission efficiency would be low in fitness depressed host plants. Increasing the genetic distance of mating parents would increase mutualism effectiveness and transmission efficiency. This tendency would be broken when the genetic distance between parents is high (out-breeding depression). Our model allows for testable hypotheses that would contribute to understand the coevolutionary origin and future of the endophyte-grass mutualism.","Gundel, PE; Omacini, M; Sadras, VO; Ghersa, CM",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro E.; Omacini, Marina; Sadras, Victor O.; Ghersa, Claudio M.",NA,"The interplay between the effectiveness of the grass-endophyte mutualism and the genetic variability of the host plant","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Sadras, Victor/D-5122-2013","Sadras, Victor/0000-0002-5874-6775; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Omacini, Marina/0000-0003-1460-262X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1752-4571",NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2010,3,"6-May",NA,NA,NA,"538","546",NA,"10.1111/j.1752-4571.2010.00152.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-4571.2010.00152.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25567945,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000281311700012",NA,416,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA

We describe the first reference genome for P. australis and compare invasive (ssp. australis) and native (ssp. americanus) genotypes collected from replicated populations across the Laurentian Great Lakes to deduce genomic bases driving its invasive success. Here, we report novel genomic features including a Phragmites lineage-specific whole genome duplication, followed by gene loss and preferential retention of genes associated with transcription factors and regulatory functions in the remaining duplicates. Comparative transcriptomic analyses revealed that genes associated with biotic stress and defence responses were expressed at a higher basal level in invasive genotypes, but native genotypes showed a stronger induction of defence responses when challenged by a fungal endophyte. The reference genome and transcriptomes, combined with previous ecological and environmental data, add to our understanding of mechanisms leading to invasiveness and support the development of novel, genomics-assisted management approaches for invasive Phragmites.","Oh, DH; Kowalski, KP; Quach, QN; Wijesinghege, C; Tanford, P; Dassanayake, M; Clay, K",NA,NA,NA,"Oh, Dong-Ha; Kowalski, Kurt P.; Quach, Quynh N.; Wijesinghege, Chathura; Tanford, Philippa; Dassanayake, Maheshi; Clay, Keith",NA,"Novel genome characteristics contribute to the invasiveness of <i>Phragmites australis</i> (common reed)","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kowalski, Kurt/GXZ-5008-2022; Dassanayake, Maheshi/B-7331-2012; Oh, Dong-Ha/O-7591-2019","Dassanayake, Maheshi/0000-0003-3123-3731; Quach, Quynh/0000-0001-6504-6358; Kowalski, Kurt/0000-0002-8424-4701; Oh, Dong-Ha/0000-0003-1526-9814",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0962-1083","1365-294X",NA,NA,NA,"FEB",2022,31,"4",NA,NA,NA,"1142","1159",NA,"10.1111/mec.16293","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.16293",NA,"21-Dec",NA,NA,NA,NA,34839548,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000729123600001",NA,417,NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA
32,"Other","We report the occurrence of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens in vanilla orchids (Vanilla phaeantha) and cultivated hybrid vanilla (V. planifolia x V. pompona) as a systemic bacterial endophyte. We determined with light microscopy and isolations that tissues of V. phaeantha and the cultivated hybrid were infected by a bacterial endophyte and that shoot meristems and stomatal areas of stems and leaves were densely colonized. We identified the endophyte as B. amyloliquefaciens using DNA sequence data. Since additional endophyte-free plants and seed of this orchid were not available, additional studies were performed on surrogate hosts Amaranthus caudatus, Ipomoea tricolor, and I. purpurea. Plants of A. caudatus inoculated with B. amyloliquefaciens demonstrated intracellular colonization of guard cells and other epidermal cells, confirming the pattern observed in the orchids. Isolations and histological studies suggest that the bacterium may penetrate deeply into developing plant tissues in shoot meristems, forming endospores in maturing tissues. B. amyloliquefaciens produced fungal inhibitors in culture. In controlled experiments using morning glory seedlings we showed that the bacterium promoted seedling growth and reduced seedling necrosis due to pathogens. We detected the gene for phosphopantetheinyl transferase (sfp), an enzyme in the pathway for production of antifungal lipopeptides, and purified the lipopeptide surfactin from cultures of the bacterium. We hypothesize that B. amyloliquefaciens is a robust endophyte and defensive mutualist of vanilla orchids.

4,"Other","Beneficial plant-associated microorganisms, such as fungal endophytes, are key partners that normally improve plant survival under different environmental stresses. It has been shown that microorganisms from extreme environments, like those associated with the roots of Antarctica plants, can be good partners to increase the performance of crop plants and to restore endangered native plants. Nothofagus alessandrii and N. glauca, are among the most endangered species of Chile, restricted to a narrow and/or limited distributional range associated mainly to the Maulino forest in Chile. Here we evaluated the effect of the inoculation with a fungal consortium of root endophytes isolated from the Antarctic host plant Colobanthus quitensis on the ecophysiological performance [photosynthesis, water use efficiency (WUE), and growth] of both endangered tree species. We also, tested how Antarctic root-fungal endophytes could affect the potential distribution of N. alessandrii through niche modeling. Additionally, we conducted a transplant experiment recording plant survival on 2 years in order to validate the model. Lastly, to evaluate if inoculation with Antarctic endophytes has negative impacts on native soil microorganisms, we compared the biodiversity of fungi and bacterial in the rhizospheric soil of transplanted individuals of N. alessandrii inoculated and non-inoculated with fungal endophytes. We found that inoculation with root-endophytes produced significant increases in N. alessandrii and N. glauca photosynthetic rates, water use efficiencies and cumulative growth. In N. alessandrii, seedling survival was significantly greater on inoculated plants compared with non-inoculated individuals. For this species, a spatial distribution modeling revealed that, inoculation with root-fungal endophytes could potentially increase the current distributional range by almost threefold. Inoculation with root-fungal endophytes, did not reduce native rhizospheric microbiome diversity. Our results suggest that the studied consortium of Antarctic root-fungal endophytes improve the ecophysiological performance as well as the survival of inoculated trees and can be used as a biotechnological tool for the restoration of endangered tree species.","Torres-Díaz, C; Valladares, MA; Acuña-Rodríguez, IS; Ballesteros, GI; Barrera, A; Atala, C; Molina-Montenegro, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Torres-Diaz, Cristian; Valladares, Moises A.; Acuna-Rodriguez, Ian S.; Ballesteros, Gabriel I.; Barrera, Andrea; Atala, Cristian; Molina-Montenegro, Marco A.",NA,"Symbiotic Interaction Enhances the Recovery of Endangered Tree Species in the Fragmented Maulino Forest","FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ballesteros, Gabriel/IAN-7082-2023; Valladares, Moisés/Q-5088-2019; Valladares, Moises A./N-1152-2017","Torres Diaz, Cristian/0000-0002-5741-5288; Valladares, Moises A./0000-0002-0294-174X; Atala, Cristian/0000-0003-1337-9534",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-462X",NA,NA,NA,NA,"15-Apr",2021,12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3389/fpls.2021.663017","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.663017",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33936153,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000645024100001",NA,447,"Both","","","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA

These microbes can play an important role in agricultural production as they promote plant growth and/or enhance the resistance of their host plant against diseases and environmental stress conditions. Although culture-independent molecular approaches such as DNA barcoding have greatly enhanced our understanding of bacterial and fungal endophyte communities, there are some methodical problems when investigating endophyte diversity. One main issue are sequence contaminations such as plastid-derived rRNA gene sequences which are co-amplified due to their high homology to bacterial 16S rRNA genes. The same is true for plant and fungal ITS sequences. The application of highly specific-primers suppressing co-amplification of these sequence contaminations is a good solution for this issue.

Relative to typical S. alterniflora, this dwarf ecotype has one-fifth the tiller height (similar to 21 cm), tenfold the tiller density (similar to 4000 tillers/m(2)), and is restricted to growth in the upper intertidal zone. Chromosome counts of the dwarfs are identical to typical smooth cordgrass (2n = 62), and smooth cordgrass-specific random amplified DNA markers confirm the species identity of the dwarf. Field collected clonal fragments of the dwarf grown for 2 yr under high-nutrient conditions maintained the dwarf syndrome, as did plants grown from the seed of a dwarf. The dwarf condition is not caused by endophytic fungi. The first dwarf smooth cordgrass patch was discovered in 1991, and by 1996 five separate dwarf patches had appeared within 200 m of the original. Since 1991, total area covered by the dwarf ecotype has increased sixfold to 140 m(2). The ecological range of the dwarf smooth cordgrass ecotype is similar to that of S. patens, a competitor on the Atlantic coast.

48,"Other","Different forms of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal inoculum are found in soil patches with differing histories. These inoculum types include spores, infected root fragments, and extramatrical hyphae. Utilizing root observation chambers, detailed observations were made of the growth dynamics of mycorrhizal hyphae from inoculum sources to roots and the subsequent radiation out from individual colonized root segments. There were several types of hyphal architecture classified by whether the external hyphae were entering (infecting) a plant root or developing from the root surface and growing out into the soil matrix. Morphologically, individual hyphal filaments within all architectural types looked quite similar and clear architectural differences could only be identified when distinct sets of interconnected hyphal filaments were studied. The primary hyphal architectural types observed in the soil were classified as runner hyphae, hyphal bridges, absorptive hyphal networks, germ tubes, and infection networks produced by spores and root fragments. The specialized hyphal architectures of these fungal endophytes appear to be linked to the unique function of each hyphal type. Runner hyphae and infection networks from either spores or root fragments were observed to be capable of infecting new root segments. Absorptive hyphal networks were never observed to act as units of infection and were classified as structures primarily involved in the acquisition of soil resources.

This model provides a framework for practitioners to use in order to identify and quantify the risks and benefits to be derived from endophytes and plants with novel traits systematically. We present two case studies of the model in practice in New Zealand legislation under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms (HSNO) Act, and indicate how the model might be used by researchers and regulators to allow for the safe introduction of new traits for biocontrol.","Bromfield, KE; Corin, S; Atapattu, A",NA,NA,NA,"Bromfield, Kate E.; Corin, Steven; Atapattu, Asela",NA,"A qualitative binary risk assessment model for regulating the biosecurity and environmental risk of endophytes","BIOLOGICAL CONTROL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1049-9644","1090-2112",NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2018,116,NA,NA,NA,NA,"46","52",NA,"10.1016/j.biocontrol.2017.05.002","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2017.05.002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000417035100007",NA,507,"Absence","","","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA
13,"Other","Tall fescue toxicosis and other maladies in livestock result from the ingestion of vasoconstrictive ergot alkaloids produced by fungal endophytes associated symbiotically with the grass. In order to facilitate future analyses of grass extracts considered responsible for outbreak of related livestock diseases, we examined the electrospray ionization mass spectra of specific ergot alkaloids under conditions that permit protonation. Our purposes were both to record the spectra with interpretation of mechanisms of fragmentation and to derive commonalities that would allow the prediction of mass spectra of related compounds for which standards were not readily available. With [M + H] + values in parentheses, water-insoluble lysergic acid peptide ergot derivatives ergovaline (m/z 534), ergotamine (m/z 582), ergocornine (m/z 562), ergocryptine (m/z 576) and ergocrystine (m/z 610) exhibited a consistent loss of water (-18 u) from the C-12′ α-hydroxy functionality. Of this group, ergovaline and ergotamine generated an m/z 320 fragment deriving from cleavage of ring E amide and ether functions with retention of the peptide ring system methyl group. Ergocornine, ergocryptine and ergocrystine similarly formed an m/z 348 fragment with retention of isopropyl. These assignments were supported by the lack of similar fragments from the water-soluble ergot ergonovine, which lacks a peptide ring system. Clavine-type ergot alkaloids lysergic acid and lysergol lack any substituents beyond simple ones directly on the C-8 position and, similarly to ergonovine, lack significant fragments at m/z 268, 251 and 225 shared by the peptide ergot alkaloids.

20,"Other","Attenuating the Taxol yield of Aspergillus terreus with the subculturing and storage were the technical challenges that prevent this fungus to be a novel platform for industrial Taxol production. Thus, the objective of this study was to unravel the metabolic machineries of A. terreus associated with attenuation of Taxol productivity, and their restoring potency upon cocultivation with the Podocarpus gracilior microbiome. The Taxol yield of A. terreus was drastically reduced with the fungal subculturing. At the 10th subculture, the yield of Taxol was reduced by four folds (78.2 mu g/l) comparing to the original culture (268 mu g/l), as authenticated from silencing of molecular expression of the Taxol-rate limiting enzymes (GGPPS, TDS, DBAT and BAPT) by qPCR analyses. The visual fading of A. terreus conidial pigmentation with the subculturing, revealing the biosynthetic correlation of melanin and Taxol. The level of intracellular acetyl-CoA influx was reduced sequentially with the fungal subculturing, rationalizing the decreasing on Taxol and melanin yields. Fascinatingly, the Taxol biosynthetic machinery and cellular acetyl-CoA of A. terreus have been completely restored upon addition of 3% surface sterilized leaves of P. gracilior, suggesting the implantation of plant microbiome on re-triggering the molecular machinery of Taxol biosynthesis, their transcriptional factors, and/or increasing the influx of Acetyl-CoA. The expression of the proteins of 74.4, 68.2, 37.1 kDa were exponentially suppressed with A. terreus subculturing, and strongly restored upon addition of P. gracilior leaves, ensuring their profoundly correlation with the molecular expression of Taxol biosynthetic genes. From the proteomic analysis, the restored proteins 74.4 kDa of A. terreus upon addition of P. gracilior leaves were annotated as ribosome biogenesis proteins YTM and microtubule-assembly proteins that belong to WD40 superfamily. Thus, further ongoing studies for molecular cloning and expression of these genes with strong promotors in A. terreus, have been initiated, to construct a novel platform of metabolically stable A. terreus for sustainable Taxol production. Attenuating the Taxol yield of A. terreus with the multiple-culturing and storage might be due to the reduction on main influx of acetyl-CoA, or downregulation of ribosome biogenesis proteins that belong to WD40 protein superfamily.","El-Sayed, ASA; Mohamed, NZ; Safan, S; Yassin, MA; Shaban, L; Shindia, AA; Ali, GS; Sitohy, MZ",NA,NA,NA,"El-Sayed, Ashraf S.

21,"Other","Stream ecosystems are affected by multiple abiotic stressors, and species responses to simultaneous stressors may differ from those predicted based on single-stressor responses. Using 12 semi-natural stream channels, we examined the individual and interactive effects of flow level (low or high flow) and addition of fine sediments (grain size <2 mm) on key ecosystem processes (leaf breakdown, algal biomass accrual) and benthic macroinvertebrate and fungal communities. Both stressors had mostly independent effects on biological responses, with sand addition being the more influential of the two. Sand addition decreased algal biomass and microbe-mediated leaf breakdown significantly, whereas invertebrate shredder-mediated breakdown only responded to flow level. Macroinvertebrate community composition responded significantly to both stressors. Fungal biomass decreased and shredder abundance increased when sand was added; thus, organisms at different trophic levels can exhibit highly variable responses to the same stressor. Terrestrial endophytic fungi were abundant in low-flow flumes where leaf mass loss was also highest, indicating that terrestrial endophytes may contribute importantly to leaf decomposition in the aquatic environment. Leaf breakdown rates depended on the identity and abundance of the dominant decomposer species, suggesting that the effects of anthropogenic activities on ecosystem processes may be driven by changes in the abundance of a few key species. The few observed interactive effects were all antagonistic (i.e., less than the sum of the individual effects); for example, increased flow stimulated algal biomass accumulation but this effect was largely cancelled by sand. While our finding that sand and stream flow did not have strong synergistic effects can be considered reassuring for management, future experiments should manipulate these and other human stressors in experiments that run for much longer periods, thus focusing on the long-term impacts of multiple simultaneously operating stressors. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","Mustonen K.-R.; Mykrä H.; Louhi P.; Markkola A.; Tolkkinen M.; Huusko A.; Alioravainen N.; Lehtinen S.; Muotka T.",NA,"",NA,"Mustonen, Kaisa-Riikka (57189442784); Mykrä, Heikki (15925949700); Louhi, Pauliina (18037547400); Markkola, Annamari (7004357278); Tolkkinen, Mikko (54685427500); Huusko, Ari (6701507838); Alioravainen, Nico (55767468100); Lehtinen, Sirkku (57191404865); Muotka, Timo (7003835341)",NA,"Sediments and flow have mainly independent effects on multitrophic stream communities and ecosystem functions","Ecological Applications",NA,NA,"English","Article",NA,"","","",NA,"Aquatic fungi; Benthic invertebrates; Decomposition; Ecosystem functions; Flow variability; Multiple stressors; Sand; Sedimentation; Streams","Animals; Biomass; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Finland; Fungi; Geologic Sediments; Invertebrates; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Plant Leaves; Plants; Rivers; Temperature; Water Movements; algae; Fungi; Invertebrata; nitrogen; phosphorus; abiotic factor; abundance; alga; benthos; biomass allocation; community response; decomposition; ecosystem function; environmental stress; flow velocity; fungus; grain size; human activity; macroinvertebrate; sand; sedimentation; stream; trophic level; animal; biomass; chemistry; classification; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; Finland; fungus; invertebrate; physiology; plant; plant leaf; procedures; river; sediment; temperature; water flow","Mustonen K.-R., Thule Institute, University of Oulu, P.O.

22,"Other","This essay considers the political economy of transnational scientific research based on global collection of biota for laboratory manipulation, focusing on a program to develop pest-resistant wheat using fungal endophytes common in a range of wild but closely related grasses. This effort extends long-standing efforts to commoditize living substances of increasing scope and complexity, and it is supported by efforts to collect and preserve biological diversity. The essay explores how imperatives of capital shape biodiversity as a policy category and determine which forms of life are saved, materially altering our records of life on earth. These newly legible and malleable organisms become more perfect commodities, suitable for standardization and transmutation into finance capital. Yet endophytes are also of interest in part because of their resistance to such control, throwing into sharp relief the reductive imperatives of commoditization while also provoking new ways of justifying capital accumulation and flow. This essay questions the extent to which histories of capitalism and science as conjoined projects rooted in the biological species concept can explain contemporary practices of biodiversity preservation and the microbiological research they support. Microbiological research provides new renderings of life on earth that may challenge or reconfigure metaphors and practices common to capitalism and science.","Fullilove, C",NA,NA,NA,"Fullilove, Courtney",NA,"Microbiology and the Imperatives of Capital in International Agro-Biodiversity Preservation","OSIRIS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0369-7827","1933-8287",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018,33,"1",NA,NA,NA,"294","318",NA,"10.1086/699993","http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/699993",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000448475600015",NA,516,"Absence","","","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA

Conventional insecticides are used for control of biting flies on cattle, but safety concerns and the buildup of insecticide resistance indicate the need for alternative control tactics. Many botanical extracts and oils are composed of more than one bioactive compound that can exert different modes of action, delaying or averting resistance. Plant genera that have shown repellency and toxicity against horn flies and stable flies include Allium, Azadirachta, Chrysanthemum, Cinnamomum, Cymbopogon, Derris, Eucalyptus, Festuca, Melaleuca, Melinus, Mentha, Nepeta, Nicotiana, Pelargonium, Pogostemon, Ricinus, Rosa, Syzygium, Vitex, and Zyloxanthum. Other botanically based methods for biting fly control have been investigated, such as the use of fatty acids, soybean trypsin inhibitors, and fungal endophytes on forage grasses. Many of the plant-based control methods have been shown to have strong effects against the two biting fly species, but work has only just begun on identifying and, in particular, developing botanically based tactics.","Showler, AT",NA,NA,NA,"Showler, Allan T.",NA,"Botanically Based Repellent and Insecticidal Effects Against Horn Flies and Stable Flies (Diptera: Muscidae)","JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2155-7470",NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2017,8,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1093/jipm/pmx010","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jipm/pmx010",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000419281300013",NA,517,"Absence","","","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA

Based on the principle of priority of publication we propose to classify all members of this clade in the genus Epichloe: We have reexamined classification of several described Epichloe and Neotyphodium species and varieties and propose new combinations and states. In this treatment we have accepted 43 unique taxa in Epichloe including distinct species, subspecies, and varieties.

28,"Other","Biodiversity research rapidly progresses due to the continuous improvement of high-throughput analysis platforms, which facilitate detailed analyses of the composition and architecture of microbial communities in various environmental niches. In the fields of applied forestry and agriculture, microbial communities are also increasingly considered, because they are involved in various kinds of biotic interactions with plants and therefore have high diagnostic value for assessing the health status of plants and soils. While in-depth identification of microbial species in environmental samples is currently achieved by next generation sequencing or microarray techniques, profiling of whole microbial communities can be accomplished via less labor-intensive approaches. We modified the protocol for automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) by targeting length polymorphism of the fungal ITS1 rRNA gene for a rapid diagnostic assessment of fungal community composition and surveyed its application spectrum. The approach allowed for spatial and temporal differentiation among fungal assemblages in soil samples and different plant species, and is therefore particularly useful for environmental screening and monitoring projects.

In this chapter, we describe how to survey seed fungi using both traditional culture-based methods and culture-free metabarcoding. We first describe protocols for the isolation and long-term preservation of fungal strains from individual seeds and for the extraction and amplification of DNA from such fungal isolates for identification with Sanger sequencing. We also detail how to extract, amplify, and sequence fungal DNA directly from individual seeds.
