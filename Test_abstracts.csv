5351,Review,"Microorganisms known as endophytic bacteria populate the intracellular niches within plant tissues without causing any negative or harmful effects. At this time, the world's population is dealing with a slew of deadly chronic diseases that impact humans. Pathogen resistance to commercial antibiotics is rising, decreasing medicines’ therapeutic potential and effectiveness. As a result, finding innovative, inexpensive, and nontoxic natural bioactive chemicals from endophytic fungi in the development of new medications with multifunctional mechanisms to fulfill human demands is critical. Fungal endophytes create valuable bioactive metabolic chemicals that have antibacterial, anticancer, antidiabetic, antiinflammatory, antitumor, and other qualities that are advantageous to humans. Pestacin, taxol, camptothecin, ergoflavin, podophyllotoxin, benzopyran, isopestacin, phloroglucinol, tetrahydroxy-1-methylxanthone, salidroside, borneol, dibenzofurane, methyl peniphenone, lipopeptide, peniphenone, and other bioactive compounds are among them. Despite the relevance of endophytic fungal metabolites, there is little information on their investigation and therapeutic significance. As a result, we will elucidate the fungal bioactive metabolites from medicinal plants, as well as their pharmacological potential, in this a topic. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

40,Both,"1. Endophytic fungi are associates of most species of plants and may modify insect community structures through the production of toxic alkaloids. Fertilization is known to increase food plant quality for herbivores, but it is also conceivable that additional nitrogen could increase the production of the insect toxic alkaloid, peramine, in endophyte-infected plants. 2. The relative importance of soil fertility and endophyte infection on herbivores and their natural enemies is unknown. As performance of the host plant is often affected by an interaction between endophyte infection and genetic background, four different plant cultivars were tested. The main questions addressed in this study were whether plant cultivar and fertilizer addition to endophyte-infected and endophyte-free Lolium perenne affect alkaloid concentrations, plant life-history traits and the abundances of aphid species and their parasitoids. 3. In a full factorial outdoor experiment we found a strong positive effect of fertilizer on plant biomass and on the abundance of aphids and parasitoids. While plant traits differed between cultivars, there was little effect of cultivar on either aphid or parasitoid abundance. Only endophyte-infected plants contained alkaloids, and the concentration of peramine was enhanced in fertilized plants. However, endophyte infection had no negative effect on aphid or parasitoid abundances. Plant traits were only weakly influenced by endophyte infection in the field, which contrasts with plant growth room studies, where both germination rate and plant height were influenced by endophyte-cultivar interactions. 4. The generally weak effects of endophytes in the outdoor experiment could be explained by various additional constraints under field conditions and the relatively low peramine concentration that we observed.","Effects of fertilizer, fungal endophytes and plant cultivar on the performance of insect herbivores and their natural enemies","Krauss, J; Härri, SA; Bush, L; Husi, R; Bigler, L; Power, SA; Müller, CB",NA,NA,NA,"Krauss, Jochen; Haerri, Simone A.; Bush, Lowell; Husi, Rene; Bigler, Laurent; Power, Sally A.; Mueller, Christine B.",NA,NA,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bigler, Laurent/AAP-3799-2020; Harri, Simone/A-6960-2010; Krauss, Jochen/C-6216-2014; Power, Sally/I-2923-2012","Krauss, Jochen/0000-0003-2304-9117; Power, Sally/0000-0002-2723-8671; Bigler, Laurent/0000-0003-3548-3594",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0269-8463,NA,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2007,21,1,NA,NA,NA,107,116,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2006.01216.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2006.01216.x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000243412200012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,40
8975,Presence,"This work, for the first time, investigated the diversity of endophytic fungi harbored in the xylem and phloem of the root of Sophora tonkinensis Gapnep from three geographic localities with emphasis on the influence of the tissue type and geographic locality on endophytic fungal communities and their potential as biocontrol agents against phytopathogens of Panax notoginseng. A total of 655 fungal strains representing 47 taxa were isolated. Forty-two taxa (89.4%) were identified but not five taxa (10.6%) according to morphology and molecular phylogenetics. Out of identifiable taxa, the majority of endophyte taxa were Ascomycota (76.6%), followed by Basidiomycota (8.5%) and Zygomycota (4.3%). The alpha-diversity indices indicated that the species diversity of endophytic fungal community harbored in the root of S. tonkinensis was very high. The colonization and species diversity of endophytic fungal communities were significantly influenced by the geographic locality but not tissue type. The geographic locality and tissue type had great effects on the species composition of endophytic fungal communities. Forty-seven respective strains were challenged by three fungal phytopathogens of P. notoginseng and six strains exhibited significant inhibitory activity. It was noteworthy that endophytic Rhexocercosporidium sp. and F. solani strongly inhibited pathogenic F. solani and other fungal phytopathogens of P. notoginseng. © 2017 The Authors.

5114,Presence,"Mangrove forests play an important role in subtropical and tropical coastal ecosystems. Endophytic fungi are widely distributed in various ecosystems and have great contribution to global biodiversity. In order to better understand the effects of mangrove species and tissue types on endophytic fungal community, we investigated cultivable endophytic fungi in leaves and twigs of four mangroves Aegiceras corniculatum, Avicennia marina, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, and Kandelia candel in Guangxi, China. The four tree species had similar overall colonisation rates of endophytic fungi (24–33%). The colonisation rates of endophytic fungi were higher in twigs (30–58%) than in leaves (6–25%) in the four plant species. A total of 36 endophytic fungal taxa were identified based on morphological characteristics and molecular data, including 35 Ascomycota and 1 Basidiomycota, dominated by Phomopsis, Phyllosticta, Xylaria, Leptosphaerulina, and Pestalotiopsis. The diversity of endophytic fungi was higher in twigs than in leaves in the four plant species. Some endophytic fungi showed host and tissue preference. The endophytic fungal community composition was different among four mangrove species and between leaf and twig tissues. © 2016 The Author(s).

743,Presence,"An effective technique was developed to inoculate mature Chewings fescue [Festuca rubra L. subsp.fallax (Thuill) Nyman] and strong creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra L. subsp. rubra) tillers with fungal endophytes (Epichloe festucae Leuchtm., Schardl, & Siegel and Neotyphodium spp.). Six tine fescue genotypes were successfully inoculated with endophytes originating from fine fescues and Poa ampla Merr. Eleven percent of the tillers were successfully inoculated, and all inoculated plants transmitted the endophytes to their offspring. This set of inoculated plants, with various combinations of genotypes and endophyte strains, allowed us to compare the effects of different endophytes on one host, and one endophyte on several hosts. When evaluated in the field, the growth characteristics of these plants were dependent on endophyte and host genotype. Considerable interaction between the genotypes was seen. For example, one host inoculated with the Poa ampla endophyte showed enhanced performance, while another host inoculated with the same endophyte performed poorly.",Cross species inoculation of Chewings and strong creeping red fescues with fungal endophytes,"Johnson-Cicalese, J; Secks, ME; Lam, CK; Meyer, WA; Murphy, JA; Belanger, FC",NA,NA,NA,"Johnson-Cicalese, J; Secks, ME; Lam, CK; Meyer, WA; Murphy, JA; Belanger, FC",NA,NA,CROP SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0011-183X,NA,NA,NA,NA,SEP-OCT,2000,40,5,NA,NA,NA,1485,1489,10.2135/cropsci2000.4051485x,http://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2000.4051485x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000089612600040,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,743
5358,Presence,"Microorganisms present in their environment influence plant growth and can be mutualists, such as mycorrhizal-forming fungi; or nonmutualists, such as endophytic fungi. In this study, fungal species from the root and rhizospheric soil of blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) cultivated in the state of Michoacán, México were isolated in order to analyze their potential as promoters of plant development. Six fungal strains were molecularly identified by the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of ribosomal DNA. Its ability to modify the development of Arabidopsis thaliana (Col 0) seedlings was evaluated through two experimental configurations (compartmentalized and non-compartmentalized Petri dishes), to investigate the influence of diffusible and volatile compounds on plant phenotype. Phialocephala fortinii and Mortierella alpina promoted growth of Arabidopsis thaliana especially in compartmentalized dishes, where an increase in the main root length (≥ 2 cm) and in the number of lateral roots (≥ 34) was observed, suggesting that volatile compounds are responsible for these increases. The selected plant-development promoter species were evaluated by ARR5::GUS and DR5::GUS reporter lines to estimate the response of genes to the accumulation of cytokinins and auxins in plant tissues. Results indicate that Phialocephala fortinii and Mortierella alpina act differentially on plant growth and represent a biological resource with great potential for use as biostimulants in current agriculture. © (2023), (Sociedad Mexicana de Fitogenetica).

In this study, we used Pedicularis kansuensis to parasitize Stipa purpurea, both with and without endophytic fungi, and to establish a parasitic system. In this study, endophytic fungal infection was found to increase the dry weight of the leaf, stem, and leaf sheath, as well as the plant height, root length, tiller number, aboveground biomass, and underground biomass of S. purpurea under root hemiparasitic stress. Meanwhile, the C-13 allocation of the leaf sheaths and roots of S. purpurea increased as the density of P. kansuensis increased, while the C-13 allocation of the leaf sheaths and roots of E+ S. purpurea was lower than that of E- S. purpurea. The C-13 allocation of the stem, leaf sheath, and root of E+ S. purpurea was higher than that of its E- counterpart. Furthermore, the content of photosynthetic C-13 and the C-13 partition rate of the stems, leaves, roots, and entire plant of S. purpurea and P. kansuensis transferred from S. purpurea increased as the density of P. kansuensis increased.

Soil microorganisms have been used to solve this problem. However, the ability of dark septate endophytic fungi (DSE) to dissolve phosphates and increase crop yield are not well known. The activity of DSE fungi capable of solubilizing reagent grade phosphates was studied in a Typic Hapludoll (Hapludol típico). The effect of the fungi on the inorganic phosphorus fractions was evaluated and an experiment was conducted in pots with sorghum as a crop. No fungal structures were found in the roots. Curvularia sp. aerial biomass and root length increased; however, P concentration was not affected.

2055,Presence,"Dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungi represent a frequent root-colonizing fungal group common in environments with strong abiotic stress, such as (semi)arid ecosystems. This work aimed to study the DSE fungi colonizing the plants of semiarid sandy grasslands with wood steppe patches on the Great Hungarian Plain. As we may assume that fungi colonizing both invasive and native species are generalists, root associated fungi (RAF) were isolated from eight native and three invasive plant species. The nrDNA sequences of the isolates were used for identification. To confirm that the fungi were endophytes an artificial inoculation system was used to test the isolates: we considered a fungus as DSE if it colonized the roots without causing a negative effect on the plant and formed microsclerotia in the roots. According to the analyses of the ITS sequence of nrDNA the 296 isolates clustered into 41 groups. We found that 14 of these 41 groups were DSE, representing approximately 60% of the isolates. The main DSE groups were generalist and showed no specificity to area or season and colonized both native and invasive species, demonstrating that exotic plants are capable of using the root endophytic fungi of the invaded areas. The DSE community of the region shows high similarity to those found in arid grasslands of North America.

One approach to reduce pathological effects has been to introduce an exotic endophyte that does not produce toxic compounds yet still confers host-plant benefits. We measured biomass accumulation and competition between two tall fescue cultivars with different endophytes grown in close proximity and tested if compounds from endophytes can diffuse from one plant to another. Ky31 (tall fescue with natural endophyte) and MaxQ (tall fescue with introduced exotic endophyte) were grown separately and together in a pot experiment under greenhouse conditions. The cultivars had comparable biomass production in monoculture, but when grown in mixed-culture MaxQ had a significantly lower tiller number (2.92 +/- 0.15 tillers/plant) and size (0.048 g +/- 0.003) than Ky31 (4.06 +/- 0.16 tillers/plant) (0.072 +/- 0.002 g). Aqueous endophyte preparations were made and applied topically to E+ and E- Ky31. E- plants receiving doses of this preparation produced significantly more tillers (3 +/- 0.18 tillers/plant) and larger tillers (0.074 +/- 0.006 g) than untreated control plants (2.2 +/- 0.13 tillers/plant) (0.0428 +/- 0.0072 g).

7364,Presence,"Taxillus chinensis (DC.) Danser is an extensively used medicinal shrub in the traditional as well as modern systems of medicines. It is a perennial hemiparasitic plant, which is difficult to propagate artificially because of its low parasitic rate. Successful parasitism of parasitic plants is to fuse their tissues and connect their vasculature to the host vasculature building a physiological bridge, which can efficiently withdraw water, sugars and nutrients from their host plants. It is reported that endophytic fungi play an important role in cell wall degradation and fusion, which is the key forming process of the physiological bridge. Therefore, in this study, the endophytic fungi from T. chinensis of different hosts were isolated, and then the organisms that could degrade the main components of the cell walls were screened out using a medium consisting of guaihuol and cellulose degradation capacity. The results showed that five strains were screened out from 72 endophytic fungi of T. chinensis which with high enzyme activities for lignocellulosic degradation. The laccase and cellulase activities of five strains reached their peaks at day 7, and the highest enzyme activities of these two enzymes were found in strain P6, which was 117.66 and 1.66 U/mL, respectively.

1135,Presence,"Background The influence of external environmental factors on secondary metabolites of medicinal plants has always been studied. However, little is known about the relationships between endophytes and host metabolites, especially the relationship differences between different plant species. Thus, we used high-throughput sequencing methods to compare endophyte diversity from roots of two closely related species, Gentiana officinalis and G. siphonantha, from the same production area, and analyze the association with four secondary metabolites (Gentiopicroside, Loganic acid, Swertiamarine and Sweroside). Results The fungal and bacteria communities' richness and diversity of G. siphonantha was higher than G. officinalis. Ascomycota and Proteobacteria were dominant fungal and bacterial phylum of the two closely related species. At the genus level, Tetracladium and Cadophora were dominant fungal genus in G. officinalis and G. siphonantha samples, respectively. While Pseudomonas was dominant bacterial genus in two closely related species, with relative abundances were 8.29 and 8.05%, respectively. Spearman analysis showed that the content of loganic acid was significantly positively correlated with endophytic fungi, the content of gentiopicroside, swertiamarine and sweroside were significantly positively correlated with endophytic bacteria in the two related species. PICRUSt and FUNGuild predictive analysis indicated that metabolism and saprotroph was primary function of endophytic bacteria and fungi in the two related species.

These fungi asymptomatically live inside the plant's tissue enhancing resistance of their hosts to herbivores and abiotic stresses. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), infected with Neotyphodium lolii can be detrimental to grazing livestock causing a neural disease. This study aimed at determining the impact of grassland management on fungal incidence. In a rural district of Central Germany 90 sites differing in land use intensity (extensive, intermediate and intensive) and grassland use (pastures, mown pastures, and meadows) were investigated for the presence of N. loliL Infections were detected in 41% of the sites sampled, but overall infection rates were low (5.8 +/- 9.2%). Neither the intensity of land use nor the type of grassland influenced endophytic incidences. In contrast, the geology of the sampled sites had a significant impact on the incidence of N. lolii. Grass tillers collected from limestone sites showed significantly higher infection rates than from other soils. We hypothesize that the low field capacity and high amount of potassium on limestone sites favored the survival of infected grasses under drought stress. Therefore, geology should be taken into account when considering management strategies for this endophytic fungus. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

8729,Presence,"There is a colossal demand for natural pigments and its applications in recent times. In the study, a novel lactone pigment was isolated from a predominant endophytic fungus residing in Bixa orellana L. (Bixaceae) leaves. The endophyte was identified as Fusarium verticillioides through morphological and molecular investigations. The optimum growth parameters of the endophyte for pigment production were at 33 oC with pH 6.5 in dark. Through comprehensive spectroscopic studies, the structure of the isolated lactone was resolved and identified as (E)-3, 3-dimethyl-4-(pent-1-en-1-yl)-4-propyldihydrofuran-2(3H)-one. The acute oral toxicity study of the pigment investigated upon female Wistar rats indicated the median lethal dose (LD50) value above 1000 mg/kg body weight affirming safety. Thus, the red pigment from the isolated endophyte may be employed as a sustainable source for natural colorant in industries owing to its non-toxicity.",Mycosynthesis of novel lactone in foliar endophytic fungus isolated from <i>Bixa orellana</i> L.,"Vijayakumar, S; Raj, R; Shaanker, U; Sivaramakrishna, A; Ramamoorthy, S",NA,NA,NA,"Vijayakumar, Sujithra; Raj, Rajani; Shaanker, Uma; Sivaramakrishna, Akella; Ramamoorthy, Siva",NA,NA,3 BIOTECH,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Akella, Sivaramakrishna/AAT-4219-2020; Ramamoorthy FLS, FRSB, FRSC, Prof. Siva/D-7133-2019","vijayakumar, Sujithra/0000-0001-5289-979X; Akella, Sivaramakrishna/0000-0002-5208-6307",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2190-572X,2190-5738,NA,NA,NA,JAN,2021,11,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1007/s13205-020-02566-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-020-02566-x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33457167,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000606858100004,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8729
5400,,"Most land plants live in association with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and rely on this symbiosis to scavenge phosphorus (P) from soil. The ability to establish this partnership has been lost in some plant lineages like the Brassicaceae, which raises the question of what alternative nutrition strategies such plants have to grow in P-impoverished soils. To understand the contribution of plant-micro biota interactions, we studied the root-associated fungal microbiome of Arabis alpina (Brassicaceae) with the hypothesis that some of its components can promote plant P acquisition. Using amplicon sequenc ing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer 2, we studied the root and rhizosphere fungal communities of A. alpina growing under natural and controlled conditions including low-P soils and identified a set of 15 fungal taxa consistently detected in its roots. This cohort included a Helotiales taxon exhibiting high abundance in roots of wild A. alpina growing in an extremely P-limited soil. Consequently, we isolated and subsequently reintroduced a specimen from this taxon into its native P-poor soil in which it improved plant growth and P uptake. The fungus exhibited mycorrhiza-like traits including colonization of the root endosphere and P transfer to the plant Genome analysis revealed a link between its endophytic lifestyle and the expansion of its repertoire of carbohydrate-active enzymes. We report the discovery of a plant- fungus interaction facilitating the growth of a nonmycorrhizal plant under native P-limited conditions, thus uncovering a previously underestimated role of root fungal microbiota in P cycling.",Root-associated fungal microbiota of nonmycorrhizal &ITArabis&IT &ITalpina &ITand its contribution to plant phosphorus nutrition,"Almario, J; Jeena, G; Wunder, J; Langen, G; Zuccaro, A; Coupland, G; Bucher, M",NA,NA,NA,"Almario, Juliana; Jeena, Ganga; Wunder, Joerg; Langen, Gregor; Zuccaro, Alga; Coupland, George; Bucher, Marcel",NA,NA,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Coupland, George/AAP-8609-2020; Bucher, Marcel/D-4596-2013; Almario, Juliana/AAF-1668-2021; Zuccaro, Alga/Q-2450-2015; Langen, Gregor/B-1407-2014","Zuccaro, Alga/0000-0002-8026-0114; Coupland, George/0000-0001-6988-4172; Almario, Juliana/0000-0002-1475-7819; Langen, Gregor/0000-0002-8321-1756",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0027-8424,1091-6490,NA,NA,NA,1-Oct,2017,114,44,NA,NA,NA,E9403,E9412,10.1073/pnas.1710455114,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1710455114,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28973917,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000414127400028,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5400
6929,,"Several endophytic fungal strains from Srikaya plants (Annona squamosa L.) have been isolated and one of them was identified as Penicillium sp. Penicillium has been proven as an established source for a wide array of unique bioactive secondary metabolites that exhibit a variety of biological activities. The aim of this study is isolation of secondary metabolite from Penicillium, an endophytic of A. squamosa L. Penicillium sp. from endophytic of A. squamosa L. was fermented in Wicherham media. The whole extract from both liquid media and mycelium was partitioned by ethyl acetate and evaporated to obtain crude ethyl acetate extract. The ethyl acetate extract was then brokedown using column chromatography with silica as stationary phase and mixture of ethyl acetate/methanol (98%:2%) as mobile phase and then was separated by sephadex column. Structure elucidation of isolated compounds were mainly done by analysis of one and two dimensional NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) data and supported by HPLC (High performance Liquid Chromatography) and MS-TOF (Mass Spectrometer-Time of Flight). Isolated secondary metabolites were tested using in vitro assays for anticancer and antimicrobial activity. For anticancer activity, the metabolites were tested against breast cancer cells (MCF-7) using MTT assay, while for antimicrobial activity was performed using disk diffusion assays. From these physical, chemical and spectral evidences that the secondary metabolites were confirmed as Chrysogine and Meleagrine.

8750,,"There is growing concern that rapid environmental degradation threatens mutualistic interactions. Because mutualisms can bind species to a common fate, mutualism breakdown has the potential to expand and accelerate effects of global change on biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption. The current focus on the ecological dynamics of mutualism under global change has skirted fundamental evolutionary issues. Here, we develop an evolutionary perspective on mutualism breakdown to complement the ecological perspective, by focusing on three processes: (1) shifts from mutualism to antagonism, (2) switches to novel partners and (3) mutualism abandonment.

We determined endophyte-related effects on some growth and physiological characteristics in one clone of meadow fescue. In a growth chamber experiment, meadow fescue and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) were planted in pots as monocultures or binary mixtures, competing in the root systems. One group of plants was adequately watered to maintain the original pot weight (control). The other group was subjected to a gradually imposed water stress, defined as soil water deficit, during 25 d (stressed plants). After rewatering, plants were allowed to regrow for 3 wk. Endophyte infection increased shoot and root dry weight by 33 and 70%, respectively, in control meadow fescue plants, and by 24 and 69% in stressed plants. Infected (E+) plants had significantly greater competitive ability than noninfected (E-) plants when grown in E-/E+ binary mixture. In binary mixtures with orchardgrass, the competitive abilities of E-and E+ plants were reduced relative to that of E-and E+ plants grown as monocultures. In response to water stress, stomatal conductance was lower in Ef than in E-plants, regardless of root competition. Noninfected plants could not completely recover in leaf water potential when exposed to root competition with infected plants or orchardgrass. The greater competitive ability of E+ plants was related to improved root and shoot growth and enhanced drought resistance.

Therefore, obtaining ophiobolin A has become an important aspect in studying activity with medicinal properties that are affected by it. Ophiobolin A-producing filamentous fungi are endophytic or infectious microbes that attack annual and short-cycle plants. Here we isolated the endophyte of Datura metel, which is an annual plant that produces ophiobolin A. Results of this study have led to the identification of an endophytic filamentous fungus Bipolaris sp. with high ophiobolin A production (235 mg/L) in liquid culture after 21 days.

9771,,"【Background and objective】Waterlogging is an abiotic stress occurring frequently during maize growth season, especially in its initial seedling stage. The crude extract of endophytePaecilomycesvariotii is a bio-stimulant widely used in China to promote plant growth and improve its resistance against waterlogging. We extracted Paecilomycesvariotii(PVE) from the endophytic fungus in a wild sea buckthorn, which is not only able to protect crops from pathogens but also promotes crop growth. However, the underlying mechanisms of how PVE enhances the tolerance of maize against waterlogging is obscure. The aim of this paper is to fill this knowledge gap.【Method】We used maize as the model plant and conducted the experiment in laboratory. Maize seedings treated with PVE were subjected to waterlogging, with seedlings not treated with PVE taken as control. For each treatment, we measured the change in chlorophyll fluorescence transient curve (OJIP) of the seedings.【Result】Waterlogging hindered growth of the maize seedling and reduced its net photosynthetic rate (Pn) as a result. Waterlogging lasting more than four days changed the OJIP curve by reducing the active reaction centre per unit area, and altered the ability of electronic transmission from QA to QB (Ψo and δRo). Treating the seedlings with PVE alleviated the waterlogging-induced decrease in specific energy fluxes per unit area for absorption (AB/CSm), trapping (TRo/CSm), and electron transport (ETo/CSm), while in the meantime maintaining a relatively high heat dissipation capacity (DIo/CSm).【Conclusion】Spraying PVE over maize seedings enhanced their tolerance to waterlogging stress and helped their quick recovery after the waterlogging receded. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Irrigation and Drainage.

2477,,"Endophytes are the microorganisms that lived inside the plant during their life cycle and develop a mutualistic or symbiotic relationship with the host plant. In mutualistic relation, the plant provides nutrition to endophyte, and in return endophyte supports the plant growth and induces immunity in the host by producing secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites play a significant role in the inhibition of plant pathogen and pest by inducing plant defense. Some of them take part in the induction of salicylic acid, jasmonic acid, and ethylene pathways which are responsible for plant defense. Different microbes like nitrogen-fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi have been explored for decades in sustainable agricultural practices; some of them are being used at a commercial level. But the role of endophytes in plant stress tolerance (biotic and abiotic) and their commercial utilization is not much explored, and researchers are only screening endophytic microbial potentials in bio-fertilizer and bio-pesticide application at lab scale. The role of bioactive compounds from fungal endophytes in sustainable agriculture is least explored. Exploration of natural phenomena of such fungal endophytes and their compounds in crop production and protection is the need of present scenario which is facing problems of pollution with synthetic chemicals and their detrimental impacts on the environment. In the current chapter, we reviewed the role of fungal endophytes and their bioactive compounds in crop production and protection.

Also, the effect of A. jodhpurensis was investigated on the mycelial growth, spore germination and hyphal structures of F. graminearum in vitro. The obtained results showed that A. jodhpurensis reduced mycelial growth and spore germination of the pathogen. Also, the spores and hyphae of the pathogen were swollen and deformed in the presence of A. jodhpurensis. Wheat root colonization by A. jodhpurensis and foliar application of methionine and sodium nitroprusside reduced the disease severity of F. graminearum and increased the plant growth parameters, such as shoot and root weight compared to the controls. Application of A. jodhpurensis, methionine and sodium nitroprusside had a significant effect in induction of resistance against F. graminearum via increasing superoxide (O-2(center dot-)), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), iron ions, phenolic contents, induction of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), guaiacol peroxidase (GPX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, membrane stability index (MSI) and relative water content (RWC) compared to the plants only inoculated with F. graminearum and uninoculated controls. Simultaneous application of A. jodhpurensis and sodium nitroprusside was more effective than simultaneous application of A. jodhpurensis and methionine. Also, simultaneous application of A. jodhpurensis, methionine and sodium nitroprusside treatments showed more effect on the plant growth parameters and resistance induction against the pathogen compared to the other treatments. Therefore, the combined A. jodhpurensis, methionine and sodium nitroprusside treatment can be used for increasing the plant growth parameters and protecting wheat plants against F. graminearum.","Function of the endophytic fungus <i>Acrophialophora jodhpurensis</i>, methionine, and nitric oxide in wheat resistance induction against <i>Fusarium graminearum</i> via interplay of reactive oxygen species and iron","Daroodi, Z; Taheri, P",NA,NA,NA,"Daroodi, Zoha; Taheri, Parissa",NA,NA,PHYSIOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Taheri, Parissa/P-5382-2015; daroodi, zoha/HNJ-0027-2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0885-5765,NA,NA,NA,NA,NOV,2023,128,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1016/j.pmpp.2023.102132,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmpp.2023.102132,NA,Sep-23,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001071126300001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4664
2010,,"Currently, there is an absolute concern for all nations in agricultural productivity to meet growing demands of human population. In recent time, biosurfactants produced by diverse group of microorganisms are used to achieve such demands as it is known for its ecofriendly use in elimination of plant pathogens and for increasing the bioavailability of nutrients for plants. Endophytic fungi are the important source of secondary metabolites and novel bioactive compounds for different biological applications. In the present study, endophytic fungi Xylaria regalis (X. regalis) recovered from the cones of Thuja plicata was evaluated for its biosurfactant producing ability and plant growth-promoting abilities through various screening methods and also via its antagonistic activity against phytopathogens like Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus niger. In addition, X. regalis was also tested in vivo for a various range of growth parameters in chilli under greenhouse conditions. Significant increase in shoot and root length, dry matter production of shoot and root, chlorophyll, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents of chilli seedlings was found, which reveals its ability to improve the growth of crop plants. Hence, this study suggests the possibility of biosurfactant producing endophytic fungi X. regalis as a source of novel green biosurfactant for sustainable agriculture to achieve growing demands.",Physiological and Molecular Characterization of Biosurfactant Producing Endophytic Fungi <i>Xylaria regalis</i> from the Cones of <i>Thuja plicata</i> as a Potent Plant Growth Promoter with Its Potential Application,"Adnan, M; Alshammari, E; Ashraf, SA; Patel, K; Lad, K; Patel, M",NA,NA,NA,"Adnan, Mohd; Alshammari, Eyad; Ashraf, Syed Amir; Patel, Kartik; Lad, Kishan; Patel, Mitesh",NA,NA,BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ashraf, Syed Amir/AAY-2793-2020; Alshammari, Eyad/AAR-8347-2021; Adnan, Mohd/N-9207-2015; Patel, Dr. Mitesh/AAR-7248-2021",", Syed Amir Ashraf/0000-0002-5333-9505; Adnan, Mohd/0000-0002-7080-6822; Patel, Dr. Mitesh/0000-0002-9283-2124; Patel, Kartik/0000-0003-0829-8350; Alshammari, Dr Eyad/0000-0003-2670-4607",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2314-6133,2314-6141,NA,NA,NA,NA,2018,2018,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1155/2018/7362148,http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/7362148,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29862287,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000431919600001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2010

2220,,"Drunken horse grass ( Achnatherum inebrians (Hance) Keng) is a toxic perennial bunchgrass native to Northwestern China. Epichloe endophytic fungi infection could enhance the stress tolerance of drunken horse grass. However, there is a scarcity of literature regarding the effects of intraspecific competition. As a result, we anticipated that the intraspecific competitive dynamics between endophyte-infected (EI) and endophyte-free (EF) plants would become more transparent for four years by planted as the proportions of 2 : 1, 1 : 1, and 1 : 2. The results showed the EI plants exhibited more biomass, seed yields, and survival rates than EF plants. Endophyte infection also facilitated a competitive advantage by enhancing photosynthesis and soil nutrition. Our findings constituted the inaugural investigation into the influence of the intraspecific competitive ability of grass infected with Epichloe endophyte fungi. EI plants caused them to become stronger and stronger, while EF became weaker and weaker by timing and planting proportion increasing, and EF drunken horse grass could be replaced by EI. These conclusions were instrumental in elucidating why the endophytic fungal infection rate of drunken horse grass is 100% observed in natural wilderness. Epichloe endophyte could reduce plant diversity and enhance the dominance of EI plants in intraspecific competition; drunken horse grass may be threatening the persistence of native plant species.",The influence of timing and planting proportion on the intraspecific competitiveness ability of drunken horse grass (<i> Achnatherum</i> inebrians (Hance) Keng) by fungal endophyte infection,"Cao, JX; Yao, X; Wei, XK; Zhang, RC; Liu, J; Li, CN",NA,NA,NA,"Cao, Jianxin; Yao, Xiang; Wei, Xuekai; Zhang, Ruochen; Liu, Jing; Li, Chuniie",NA,NA,PLANT SOIL AND ENVIRONMENT,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zhang, Ruochen/HOC-1927-2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1214-1178,1805-9368,NA,NA,NA,NA,2024,70,7,NA,NA,NA,418,429,10.17221/9/2024-PSE,http://dx.doi.org/10.17221/9/2024-PSE,NA,May-24,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001230586200001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2220
3594,,"Fossil fuels and petroleum that have driven the industrial development in the modern society for the last two centuries are on the verge of decline. The usage of renewable resources and green technologies will ensure the environmental sustainability in the long run. Biorefinery includes sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of marketable products and energy. The main driver for the establishment of biorefineries is the holistic environmental sustainability. Biorefinery integrates upstream, midstream and downstream processing of biomass into a range of value-added products. Industrially scaled up biorefineries are expected to contribute to an increased competitiveness and wealth of the countries by responding to the need for supplying a wide range of bio-based products and energy in an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable manner in future. Fungi play an important role in addressing major global challenges. The shift from chemical processes to biological processing achieved by using fungal (and bacterial) enzymes in industries such as textiles, leather, paper and pulp has significantly reduced negative impact on the environment. Filamentous fungi (belonging to the ascomycetes, basidiomycetes and zygomycetes classes) are of great interest as biocatalysts in biorefineries as they naturally produce and secrete a variety of different organic acids that can be used as building blocks in the chemical industry. Fungal endophytes are also the storehouse of naturally occurring bioactive compounds which are not only useful to plants but also to humans. The chapter summarises the current status of work done in the area and the role of fungi/fungal endophytes in helping to resolve some of the problems relating to environment and sustainability.

734,,"An 8-month greenhouse study was conducted to investigate the belowground effects of infection of wild barley by the foliar endophyte Epichloё bromicola. The effects of endophyte infection status (E+: endophyte infected; E-: endophyte free) on soil chemical and microbiological properties were tested in three soils collected from Maqu, Yuzhong, and Linze in Gansu province, China. We measured the dry matter production of plants at 3, 6, and 8 months after establishment. The soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorous contents, pH, and the abundance of bacteria, fungi, and key bacteria involved in the soil nitrogen cycle were determined at 6 and 8 months after plant establishment. The dry matter production of wild barley was significantly higher in E+ plants than in E- plants in all three soils. Irrespective of endophyte status, the dry matter production was highest in Linze soils and lowest in Maqu soils. The presence of the endophyte significantly increased soil total nitrogen content and the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. The effects of endophyte status on total soil carbon, microbial biomass carbon, pH, abundance of bacteria, fungi, denitrifying bacteria, and nitrous oxide-reducing bacteria varied with soil type and plant age. The total phosphorus content in soil varied significantly with soil type and plant age but not with endophyte status. These results confirmed that E. bromicola infection of wild barley influences the chemical and microbiological properties of soil in a soil type- and plant age-dependent manner. We suggest that long-term field studies in the future would be beneficial for understanding the mechanisms driving these observed changes in soil properties. © 2019, Editorial Office of Acta Prataculturae Sinica.

3454,,"Ferns represent the basal group of vascular plants and are known to have fungal interactions with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, but diversity of endophytic fungi from ferns is rarely studied. Moreover, fungal diversity associated with ferns is likely underestimated as most studies have been performed based on a microscopic or culture-dependent approach. In this study, we investigated the endophytic fungal diversity within roots and sporophore of an endangered Korean fern (Mankyua chejuense), and compared it to fungi in surrounding soil using a metabarcoding approach. A high diversity of endophytic fungi (236 OTUs), mostly belonging to Ascomycota, was detected and fungal richness and composition were significantly different between habitats. Indicator species analysis showed that endophytic fungi have similar ecological characteristics to fungal species found from other land plants. Our results suggest that various fungal species are associated with ferns, thus understanding fern-associated fungal diversity can have a great implication for fern biology and conservation.

3411,,"Exploitation of the symbiotic relationship between endophytic fungi and ryegrass is a crucial technique for reducing the incidence of insect pests. This is primarily due to the production of alkaloids, such as peramine, by the fungi. This alkaloid has been reported as both a deterrent and toxic to a variety of insects. However, insects have developed various strategies to counteract plant defenses. One of the most studied methods is their ability to sequester toxic compounds from plants. In this study, we examined the feeding preferences and adaptation to peramine in Chilesia rudis, a native Chilean larva. Using a no-choice assay, we assessed larval feeding preferences and mass gain on seven experimental lines and two commercial cultivars of endophyte-infected and non-infected ryegrass. Pupal development time and adult performance were evaluated post-assay. Additionally, we measured peramine content in larval carcasses, feces, and ryegrass leaves. Jumbo was the most preferred cultivar with 32 mm(2) of leaf tissues consumed. The longest pupal development time was observed in L161 and ALTO AR1, both at 28 days. Wing length in adults was greatest in the Jumbo and L163 cultivars, measuring 1.25 cm and 1.32 cm, respectively. Peramine concentrations were detected in the bodies of C. rudis.

Endophytic fungi have been reported as potential candidates in controlling pathogens since they are considered strong plant mutualists that confer disease resilience to their host. The present study was carried out to determine the in vitro antagonistic activity and biocontrol potential of endophytic Aspergillus spp. associated with Plectranthus amboinicus leaves against F. verticillioides. Three fungal endophytes from the genus Aspergillus, namely; A. tamarii, A. terreus and A. niger were isolated and identified from the leaves of P. amboinicus,. The fungal isolates were tested for their antagonism against F. verticillioides in dual culture plates. Results indicated that the Aspergillus endophytes can restrict the growth of F. verticillioides through varying mechanisms of antagonism. A. niger inhibited F. verticillioides by 47.37%, followed by A. tamarii (41.02%) and A. terreus (27.91%). Dual culture observations revealed that A. tamarii and A. niger antagonized the growth of F. verticillioides via overgrowth mechanism while A. terreus employed antibiosis to restrict the pathogen. These varying degrees of antagonism by the Aspergillus endophytes exhibited their potential as biocontrol agents and source of bioactive compounds. © 2021.

3705,,"Fungal communities associated with plants often decrease in similarity as the distance between sampling sites increases (i.e., they demonstrate distance decay). In the southwestern USA, forests occur in highlands separated from one another by warmer, drier biomes with plant and fungal communities that differ from those at higher elevations. These disjunct forests are broadly similar in climate to one another, offering an opportunity to examine drivers of distance decay in plant-associated fungi across multiple ecologically similar yet geographically disparate landscapes. We examined ectomycorrhizal and foliar endophytic fungi associated with a dominant forest tree (Pinus ponderosa) in forests across ca. 550 km of geographic distance from northwestern to southeastern Arizona (USA). Both guilds of fungi showed distance decay, but drivers differed for each: ectomycorrhizal fungi are constrained primarily by dispersal limitation, whereas foliar endophytes are constrained by specific environmental conditions. Most ectomycorrhizal fungi were found in only a single forested area, as were many endophytic fungi. Such regional-scale perspectives are needed for baseline estimates of fungal diversity associated with forest trees at a landscape scale, with attention to the sensitivity of different guilds of fungal symbionts to decreasing areas of suitable habitat, increasing disturbance, and related impacts of climate change.",Drivers and implications of distance decay differ for ectomycorrhizal and foliar endophytic fungi across an anciently fragmented landscape,"Bowman, EA; Arnold, AE",NA,NA,NA,"Bowman, Elizabeth A.; Arnold, A.

2438,,"Endophytes are microorganisms that live inside plants without causing visible symptoms, at least during some parts of their life cycle. We studied, for the first time, the combined effects of CO2 enrichment (700 ppm) and fungal endophyte inoculation on the growth, the concentrations of low-molecular weight phenolics, and condensed tannins of aspen (Populus tremula) seedlings. As expected, we found that the endophyte strain we inoculated was neutral to plant growth and was able to bypass major plant defences. In addition, CO2 enrichment alone boosted plant growth, but had only minor effects on plant phenolics. Neither did it affect the plant-endophyte relationship. Based on our findings, we suggest that the successful and asymptomatic colonization of endophytes that we found in aspen might be due to the endophytes' special attributes enabling them to thrive inside plant tissues and to avoid or counteract the plant's chemical defences.

4135,,"Ginseng (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer) is a well-known medicinal plant which is used as a tonic in oriental medicine. Ginsenosides are the most important secondary metabolites of ginseng which have pharmacological effects including anticancer, antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, hepatoprotective, and anti-stress properties. Bacterial and fungal endophytes associated with ginseng plants have been isolated, characterized from its natural distribution range. Endophytes of ginseng showed tissue or organ, age, genotype, and geographical location specificity with their distribution and abundance. Bacillus, Burkholderia, Lysinibacillus, Micrococcus, Paenibacillus, and Pseudomonas are major bacterial genera isolated from ginseng. Alternaria, Colletotrichum, Entrophospora, Fusarium, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Phoma, Setophoma, Verticillium, and Xylaria are the most frequent fungal genera isolated from ginseng.

A further TLC scan and high-performance liquid chromatography-evaporative light-scattering detection (HPLC-ELSD) showed that one ingredient of the extract of strain Fu7 had a similar absorption curve in the range 200-700 nm and the same retention time as authentic sipeimine.

2931,,"Endophytic fungi from healthy leaf tissues of Houttuynia cordata Thunb., a widely used ethnomedicinal plant of Northeast India, were investigated, and an attempt has been made to characterize the antimicrobial metabolites from some potent endophytic strains. Altogether, 56 endophytic fungal isolates were obtained from surface-sterilized leaf fragments of H. cordata. The endophytes consisted of fungi belonging to genera Colletotrichum, Curvularia, Bipolaris, Corynespora, and Pseudozyma and non-sporulating fungi categorized as mycelia sterilia. Assay for antimicrobial activity revealed that 73.07% of the isolates showed activity against the test pathogens in varying degrees, whereas 92.32% of the isolates showed anticandida activity against Candida albicans. Among the isolates, two endophytic fungi identified as Colletotrichum coccodes and Phyllosticta capitalensis showed a significant antimicrobial activity against all the test pathogens. The metabolites obtained from C. coccodes revealed the presence of different functional groups and bioactive compounds such as geranylgeraniol, farnesol, hexacosanol, oleic acid, and squalene. Metabolites obtained from P. capitalensis also showed various functional groups and the presence of bioactive compound, 1-Octacosanol among several others. The study indicated that the ethnomedicinal plants are colonized by the rich diversity of endophytic fungi with antimicrobial activity. A further detailed investigation could practically lead to the development of pharmaceutical agents in the future. © 2020 Rajreepa Talukdar et al.","Antimicrobial secondary metabolites obtained from endophytic fungi inhabiting healthy leaf tissues of Houttuynia cordata Thunb., an ethnomedicinal plant of Northeast India",Talukdar R.; Wary S.; Mili C.; Roy S.; Tayung K.,NA,,NA,"Talukdar, Rajreepa (57218995601); Wary, Sudem (57218998487); Mili, Chiranjib (57218991089); Roy, Subham (57225865688); Tayung, Kumananda (55750920000)",NA,NA,Journal of Applied Pharmaceutical Science,NA,NA,English,,,,,NA,Antimicrobial activity; Endophytic fungi; Houttuynia cordata; Metabolite characterization,,"Department of Botany, Gauhati University, Guwahati, India","Talukdar R., Department of Botany, Gauhati University, Guwahati, India; Wary S., Department of Botany, Gauhati University, Guwahati, India; Mili C., Department of Botany, Gauhati University, Guwahati, India; Roy S., Department of Botany, Gauhati University, Guwahati, India; Tayung K., Department of Botany, Gauhati University, Guwahati, India","K.

4602,,"In the scope of mitigating the negative impacts of pesticide use and managing greenhouse whiteflies, Trialeurodes vaporariorum sustainably, 16 endophytic fungal isolates from five different genera (Beauveria, Trichoderma, Hypocrea, Bionectria, and Fusarium) were screened for their ability to colonise two preferred host plant species, namely, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), through seed inoculation. Seven and nine isolates were endophytic to P. vulgaris and S. lycopersicum, respectively, where significant differences in the endophytic colonisation rates were observed among the fungal isolates in P. vulgaris and its plant parts, with a significant interaction between the isolates and plant parts in S. lycopersicum. Hypocrea lixii F3ST1, Trichoderma asperellum M2RT4, Trichoderma atroviride F5S21, and T. harzianum KF2R41 successfully colonised all the plant parts of both hosts and therefore were selected and further evaluated for their endophytic persistence, effect on plant growth, and pathogenicity to T. vaporariorum adults and F1 progeny. The four endophytes remained in both host plants for the 5-week assessment with varied colonisation rates related to the strong interaction with the time, isolates, and plant parts in both hosts. The effect of the same endophytes on the different host growth parameters varied in P. vulgaris and S. lycopersicum, with T. asperellum M2RT4 not boosting the growth in both host plants while T. atroviride F5S21 resulted in enhanced shoot biomass in S. lycopersicum. T. atroviride F5S21 and T. harzianum KF2R41 inoculated S. lycopersicum plants and H. lixii F3ST1, T. asperellum M2RT4, and T. harzianum KF2R41 inoculated P. vulgaris plants had significantly lower oviposition, while nymph development in both hosts was significantly prolonged in all the endophytically-colonised plants. The endophytes H. lixii F3ST1 and T. asperellum M2RT4 significantly reduced the longevity/survival of the exposed T. vaporariorum adults and the progeny in both S. lycopersicum and P. vulgaris. The findings demonstrate the attributes of the various endophytes in host plant growth promotion as well as their effects on the life-history parameters of T. vaporariorum and could consequently be developed as potential endophytic fungal-based biopesticides for the sustainable management of the pest in S. lycopersicum and P. vulgaris cropping systems.","Endophytic Colonisation of <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> and <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> by Fungal Endophytes Promotes Seedlings Growth and Hampers the Reproductive Traits, Development, and Survival of the Greenhouse Whitefly, <i>Trialeurodes vaporariorum</i>","Paradza, VM; Khamis, FM; Yusuf, AA; Subramanian, S; Ekesi, S; Akutse, KS",NA,NA,NA,"Paradza, Vongai M.; Khamis, Fathiya M.; Yusuf, Abdullahi A.; Subramanian, Sevgan; Ekesi, Sunday; Akutse, Komivi S.",NA,NA,FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yusuf, Abdullahi/E-4701-2011; Paradza, Vongai/JRW-6012-2023; Khamis, Fathiya/ADJ-2867-2022; Akutse, Komivi/I-8137-2019; , Subramanian/H-8531-2014","Yusuf, Abdullahi/0000-0002-8625-6490",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-462X,NA,NA,NA,NA,19-Nov,2021,12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3389/fpls.2021.771534,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.771534,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34868170,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000742459800001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4602
9768,,"‘Biostimulants’ appeared as the boon to the sustainable agriculture system which are actually versatile products (natural and chemically synthesized) and/or organisms (beneficial microbes, free-living or rhizospheric or endosymbiotic) which significantly potentiates the process of agronomic trait improvement in plants without compromising the final yield, quality and ecological balance. In this emerging field of agriculture, the fungal endophytes have been considered as potential “biostimulants” that could facilitate commercial bio-prospecting of high value secondary metabolites from higher and lower groups of medicinal plants in the most sustainable, mutualistic. Recently, cultivation of medicinal and aromatic crops has secured special status in agriculture and conservation system. Globally, the accelerated demand for complementary and alternative medicine has widened economic prospects of farmers and huge profitability could be predicted for elite chemotypes (high metabolite yielding varieties suitable for industrial harvest). The natural co-existence of endophytes, and their cross talk with host plant regulating secondary metabolism, stress reversal and defense has been investigated extensively both in wild and in-vitro condition. In this chapter we have highlighted fungal endophytes and their role as ‘microbial consortia’ in mutual symbiosis with medicinal crops (host), which constitutively triggered higher accumulation of expensive biopharmaceuticals, growth promotion, biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. Moreover, streamlined discussion has been provided for mechanism of action, modulation and signal transduction, biotechnological advancement and futuristic manipulative strategies to aid sustainable agriculture system. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

691,,"Although fungal endophytes of grasses have been known since the 1930s, their economic importance was not recognized until an association was made in the late 1970s between Acremonium coenophialum Morgan-Jones and Gams and a toxicity syndrome in livestock consuming tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). Cattle consuming endophyte-infected tall fescue have reduced growth, conception, milk production, and intolerance to heat. In horses, high foal mortality and agalactia occur on endophyte-infected grass. Sheep consuming perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) infected with the endophyte Acremonium lolii Latch, Christensen and Samuels are afflicted with a staggers syndrome, resulting in reduced weight gain. Endophyte-free, as compared with infected tall fescue, can increase steer weight gains by 30 to over 100% and furnish normal conception and milk production in beef cows. Since most tall fescue pastures in the USA are infected with the endophyte, livestock economic losses are high. Beef cattle annual losses are conservatively estimated at $354 million in reduced calf numbers and $255 million in reduced weaning weights, The poor performance of beef steers on infected tall fescue pasture has prevented its use for stocker production, resulting in higher production costs on high-quality winter annual pastures. Foal mortality of mares grazing tall fescue can be high, but no estimate of losses is available. Wild rabbit populations are reduced when consuming tall fescue. The mutualistic symbiosis of the endophyte and the grass confers a number of benefits on the host plant such as insect and nematode resistance, drought tolerance, and improved competition with other plant species. Endophyte infection of turf grasses confers improved growth and resistance to environmental stresses. In contrast, the use of endophyte-free grass cultivars for improved animal performance results in plants less tolerant of pests, drought, and overgrazing. Stand losses of endophyte-free tall fescue have been greatest on farms in the southern part of the USA tall fescue belt where environmental stresses are greatest. Better grazing management practices are necessary to maintain stands and productivity of endophyte-free grass cultivars. Ideally, modification of the fungal endophyte to remove the harmful properties and maintain those beneficial to the host plant is the ultimate solution. The increasing number of scientists from many disciplines attracted to research on the grass-endophyte relationship offers much promise for the future.",IMPORTANCE AND ECONOMIC-SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ACREMONIUM ENDOPHYTES TO PERFORMANCE OF ANIMALS AND GRASS PLANT,"HOVELAND, CS",NA,NA,NA,"HOVELAND, CS",NA,NA,AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,NA,NA,NA,INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON ACREMONIUM-GRASS INTERACTIONS,"NOV 05-07, 1990","NEW ORLEANS, LA","USDA ARS, USDA CRS, USDA, LOUISIANA AGR EXPT STN",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0167-8809,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAR,1993,44,4-Jan,NA,NA,NA,3,12,10.1016/0167-8809(93)90036-O,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0167-8809(93)90036-O,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1993KZ99700002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,691
7604,,"The biosynthesis of vanillin and other vanilla flavor compounds is still not completely understood. A better understanding of the pathways and how they are regulated may lead to better control of the production of the flavor and thus increase the commercial value of the pods. Non-synthetic vanilla flavor consists of over 250 components, with vanillin being the major one in terms of amount in the pod. Synthetic pure vanillin lacks complex flavor notes, and thus cannot replace vanilla in high quality products. Although customers prefer non synthetic flavors, non-synthetic vanilla extract is approximately 200 times more expensive than its synthetic counterpart. To produce non-synthetic vanillin, fungi are being used for the biotransformation of vanillin precursors into vanillin. All plants contain several fungal endophytes which do not cause any symptoms of diseases; some endophytes are plant-specific and are thought to play a role in the interaction of the plant with its environment. Certain fungal endophytes have been reported to produce secondary metabolites previously thought to be produced by the plant; such fungi, particularly those isolated from pods, may play a role in the biosynthesis of vanillin and vanilla flavor compounds in the plant. This could be in the form of complete pathways, or parts of the vanillin pathway, interacting with the plant's vanilla flavor compounds biosynthesis machinery. Furthermore, studies on a possible role for endophytes may help to elucidate aspects of the vanillin biosynthetic pathway that still are under debate. Terroir effects on flavor, as observed for vanilla pods, may be due to the presence of microorganisms in the rhizosphere or in the plant itself. Based on this analysis, it is proposed that vanilla plant endophytes are studied and investigated for the presence of possible vanillin and vanilla flavor biosynthetic reactions. As a first step, fungal endophytes have been isolated from vanilla pods from Reunion Island and found to be involved with the development of the vanilla flavor.",Vanilla flavor production methods: A review,"Khoyratty, S; Kodja, H; Verpoorte, R",NA,NA,NA,"Khoyratty, Shahnoo; Kodja, Hippolyte; Verpoorte, Robert",NA,NA,INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Verpoorte, Robert/Y-4363-2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0926-6690,1872-633X,NA,NA,NA,1-Dec,2018,125,NA,NA,NA,NA,433,442,10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.09.028,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2018.09.028,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000448095400050,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7604
7392,,"Temperate forests ecosystems are threatened by declines and diseases worldwide. Causes have been investigated during the last decades allowing, in some cases, to relate such deterioration to climate change or pathogens but, in many cases, causes have not yet been elucidated. In recent decades, a phenomenon of grouped mortality, whose etiology remains unknown, has been observed in the two most distributed Nothofagus species of North Patagonian forests. This study aimed to assess sapwood-inhabiting fungal diversity of N. dombeyi and N. pumilio trees in healthy and affected stands in order to determine whether health condition shape these fungal communities, to characterize such patterns and, to seek for the likely pathogens associated with tree damage. Seven sites in Los Alerces National Park (Chubut, Argentina), were sampled seasonally for two years. Eighty-eight fungal taxa were recovered and identified. Spatial heterogeneity across plant compartments was found, involving community composition and structure, with stem harbouring greater diversity than root. It was found that the sapwood in both Nothofagus species was inhabited by different fungal species, in high richness and showing different patterns according to health condition and plant compartment. Health condition was a stronger driver of N. dombeyi sapwood-inhabiting fungal community than it was for N. pumilio; the latter evidenced plant compartment as a stronger driver of such community. Nothofagus pumilio presented higher frequency of decomposition agents in both affected and healthy trees than it was in N. dombeyi, indicating a greater wood deterioration of its stands. More decomposition agents and potential pathogens have been found in symptomatic stands of N. dombeyi than in healthy stands, although their frequency patterns do not allow the inference of conclusions about the primary fungal agent causing tree mortality. Our findings suggest a secondary role of living-wood-inhabiting mycobiota in tree damage processes as an expression of tree stress caused by climatic factors.","Sapwood-inhabiting mycobiota and <i>Nothofagus</i> tree mortality in Patagonia: Diversity patterns according to tree species, plant compartment and health condition","Molina, L; Rajchenberg, M; de Errasti, A; Aime, MC; Pildain, MB",NA,NA,NA,"Molina, Lucia; Rajchenberg, Mario; de Errasti, Andres; Aime, Mary Catherine; Belen Pildain, Maria",NA,NA,FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"; Aime, Mary/S-7621-2018","Molina, Lucia/0000-0003-1073-8810; Aime, Mary/0000-0001-8742-6685",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0378-1127,1872-7042,NA,NA,NA,15-Apr,2020,462,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.117997,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.117997,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000528189800028,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7392

5086,,"Maize is a crucial staple crop that ensures global food security by supplying essential nutrients. However, heavy metal (HM) contamination inhibits maize growth, reduces output, and affects food security. Some endophytic fungi (EFs) in maize seeds have the potential to enhance growth and increase dry biomass, offering a solution to mitigate the negative effect of HM contamination. Using these functional EFs could help maintain crop production and ensure food safety in HM-contaminated areas. In the present study, the diversity of EFs in corn grains from various HM-contaminated areas in China was studied through culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. We tested the plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits of several dominant culturable isolates and evaluated the growth-promoting effects of these twenty-one isolates through pot experiments. Both studies showed that HM contamination increased the diversity and richness of corn grain EFs and affected the most dominant endophytes. Nigrospora and Fusarium were the most prevalent culturable endophytes in HM-contaminated areas. Conversely, Cladosporium spp. were the most isolated endophytes in non-contaminated areas. Different from this, Saccharomycopsis and Fusarium were the dominant EFs in HM-contaminated sites, while Neofusicoccum and Sarocladium were dominant in non-contaminated sites, according to a culture-independent analysis. PGP trait tests indicated that 70% of the tested isolates (forty-two) exhibited phosphorus solubilization, IAA production, or siderophore production activity. Specifically, 90% of the tested isolates from HM-contaminated sites showed better PGP results than 45% of the isolates from non-contaminated sites. The benefit of the twenty-one isolates on host plant growth was further studied through pot experiments, which showed that all the isolates could improve host plant growth. Among them, strains derived from HM-contaminated sites, including AK18 (Nigrospora), AK32 (Beauveria), SD93 (Gibberellia), and SD64 (Fusarium), had notable effects on enhancing the dry biomass of shoots and roots of maize under Cd stress. We speculate that the higher ratio of PGP EFs in corn grains from HM-contaminated areas may explain their competitiveness in such extreme environments. Fusarium and Cladosporium isolates show high PGP properties, but they can also be phytopathogenic. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate their pathogenic properties and safety for crops before considering their practical use in agriculture.",The Mechanisms of Cadmium Stress Mitigation by Fungal Endophytes from Maize Grains,"Awais, M; Xiang, YY; Yang, D; Lai, YB; Cai, FL; Shah, NL; Khan, M; Li, HY",NA,NA,NA,"Awais, Muhammad; Xiang, Yingying; Yang, Dian; Lai, Yibin; Cai, Fenglian; Shah, Naila; Khan, Majid; Li, Haiyan",NA,NA,JOURNAL OF FUNGI,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Li, Haiyan/AAP-9200-2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2309-608X,NA,NA,NA,AUG,2024,10,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3390/jof10080581,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof10080581,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,39194906,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001307146800001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5086

The chestnut blight pathogen, Cryphonectria parasitica, was never found associated with D. kuriphilus. Based on the present study, an active role for D. kuriphilus as a vector of chestnut fungal endophyte/pathogens cannot be demonstrated but neither ruled out. (C) 2019 British Mycological Society.

The structures of the two new compounds (1 and 2) were determined on the basis of HRESI-MS and NMR data in comparison with the data of literatures. Compounds 1 and 2 are a pair of stereo-isomers with a unique furan ring fused in the macrolide ring, which are rare in nature. Compounds 1–4 showed no inhibitory effects against three cancer cell lines and plant pathogens. The results imply that endophytic fungi inhabiting desert plants have potential to produce secondary metabolites with novel structures, and are one of vital resources for natural product discovery. Based on the structural features and biological effects, the possible ecological role of these compounds (1–4) was suggested. Copyright © 2020 Institute of Microbiology, CAS.

3950,,"Fungal plant symbionts can be highly specialized on a limited range of host genotypes and species. Understanding the genetic basis of this specialization, the mechanisms governing its establishment and the relationship between specialization and speciation is a major challenge for evolutionary biologists (Timms & Read, ). A deeper knowledge of evolutionary plant-microbe interactions could be exploited to improve agricultural management, by bringing fungal biodiversity and fungal biomass under greater and more durable human control. Previous studies on pathogens have shown that effectors, that is, small secreted proteins that modulate plant physiology to favour host colonization, play a key role in infection of novel hosts (e.g., Inoue etal., ) or in host specialization (e.g., Liao etal. ()). Like pathogens, endophytes also manipulate the physiology of their hosts and colonize novel hosts to which they specialize (Hardoim etal., ). These biological characteristics of endophytes raise the question of similarities in the protein arsenal contributing to the specialization of pathogens and endophytes. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Schirrmann etal. () used a combination of divergence genome scans and tests for positive selection to investigate the genetic basis of specialization of two subspecies of the symbiont Epichloe typhina occurring on two different grass hosts. Their analyses suggest a key role of effectors as determinants of host specialization. This study paves the way towards the comparative analysis of the genomics of speciation among plant symbionts.",What makes a specialized endophyte special?,"Gladieux, P",NA,NA,NA,"Gladieux, Pierre",NA,NA,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gladieux, Pierre/IZP-8491-2023; Gladieux, Pierre/D-1014-2014","Gladieux, Pierre/0000-0003-1929-1576",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0962-1083,1365-294X,NA,NA,NA,AUG,2018,27,15,NA,NA,NA,3037,3039,10.1111/mec.14775,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.14775,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30133874,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000440148900002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3950

2676,,"Endophytic fungi are a rich source of novel organic compounds with interesting biological activities and a high level of biodiversity. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to isolate, characterize and screen the Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum Linn.) root fungal endophytic fractions (TRF) for hepatoprotective and antioxidant activities. Endophytic fungi from Ocimum sanctum Linn. roots were isolated and cultured aseptically in PDA media. The full fledged grown fungus cultures were fermented in potato dextrose broth and fractionated using ethyl acetate. TRF-1 and TRF-2 were subjected free radical scavenging activities against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, hydroxyl free radicals and reducing power assay. TRF-1 was found to be potential free radical scavenger with IC50 values of 71. 83 μg/ml for DPPH and 110. 85 μg/ml for hydroxyl radical respectively. TRF-1 and TRF-2 were further assessed for hepatoprotective activity in CCl4 induced hepatotoxicity in-vivo. Results showed that TRF-1 (200 mg/kg p. o.) and TRF-2 (200 mg/kg p. o.) significantly reversed the actions of carbon tetrachloride induced hepatotoxicity, as evident by restoration of serum AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin, triglycerides and protein level to normal values as compared to CCl4 treated group. Restoration of altered LPO (p < 0. 001), GSH (p < 0. 01) and catalase (p < 0. 01) by TRF-1 suggests that the hepatoprotective activity may be attributed to its antioxidant action. This was further supported by histopathological studies. TRF-1 was subjected to rDNA sequencing studies by PCR technique. Based on the morphological and molecular characterization, the fungus was identified as Paecilomyces variotti Bain. Therefore, endophytes from medicinal plants represent great potential for the discovery of new pharmacologically active metabolites. © 2012 Institute of Oriental Medicine, Kyung Hee University.",Hepatoprotective and antioxidant activities of crude fractions of endophytic fungi of Ocimum sanctum Linn. in rats,Shukla S.T.; Kulkarni V.H.; Habbu P.V.; Jagadeesh K.S.; Patil B.S.; Smita D.M.,NA,,NA,"Shukla, S.T.

2769,,"Endophytic fungi are microorganisms capable to colonize the interior of plant tissues without causing damage to its plant host. This interaction is positive to both organisms; the plant provides nutrition and protection to the fungus and the microorganism secretes secondary metabolites and hydrolytic enzymes, which help the plant in the combat of phytopathogens like insects and filamentous fungi, that are the main cause of considerable losses in agriculture. The endophytic fungus is also important to increase the tolerance to abiotic stresses such as heavy metals, drought, salt and high temperatures and promoting plant growth.

3082,,"Endophytic fungi play important roles in the modification of ecosystem productivity; however, the underlying mechanisms are only partly understood. A 2-year field plot experiment verified that the endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris increased peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) yields and significantly increased nodulation and N-2 fixation regardless of whether N fertilizers were added. Root exudates collected from P. liquidambaris-colonized plants significantly improved nodulation and N-2 fixation. Rhizosphere stimulation experiments further showed that colonized root exudates had significantly decreased soil nitrate (NO3-) concentrations, with decreased abundance and diversity of ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA). In contrast, the abundance and diversity of diazotrophs significantly increased, and most diazotrophs identified were peanut nodulation-related strains (Bradyrhizobium sp.). P. liquidambaris symbiosis increased the expression of phenolic and flavonoid synthesis-related genes, and the derived phenolics and flavonoids could effectively increase the chemotaxis, biofilm formation, and nodC gene expression (nodulationrelated biological processes) of the Bradyrhizobium strain. Metabolic pattern analysis showed that phenolics and flavonoids are more likely to accumulate to higher levels in the rhizosphere soil of peanuts colonized with P. liquidambaris. Finally, a synthetic root exudate experiment further confirmed the underlying mechanisms for the P. liquidambaris-induced improvement in nodulation and N-2 fixation, i.e., that the specific root exudates derived from P. liquidambaris colonization decrease nitrate concentration and increase the population and biological activities of peanut nodulation-related Bradyrhizobium species, which beneficially enhance peanut-Bradyrhizobium interactions. Therefore, this study is the first to provide new insight into a positive relationship between an exotic endophytic fungus, crop nodulation, and N-2 fixation increase. IMPORTANCE Endophytic fungi play an important role in balancing the ecosystem and boosting host growth; however, the underpinning mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we found that endophytic fungal colonization with P. liquidambaris significantly increased the productivity, nodulation, and N-2 fixation of peanuts through the secretion of specific root exudates. We provide a reasonable mechanism explaining how P. liquidambaris promotes peanut nodulation and N-2 fixation, whereby the specific root exudates produced by P. liquidambaris colonization decrease rhizosphere soil nitrate (NO3(-)) and increase the population and biological activities of peanut-nodulating-related Bradyrhizobium strains, which is beneficial to enhancing the peanut-Bradyrhizobium symbiotic interaction.

We elucidated the structures of the metabolites by extensive NMR spectroscopy studies, including DEPT, COSY, NOESY, HSQC, HMBC, and chiroptical methods. The trivial names proposed for these compounds are preussornerin EG(1) (1), preussornerin EG(2) (2) and preussomerin EG(3) (3). In addition, the X-ray data for 4 were obtained. The bioactivity of the mycelial organic extracts and the pure compounds was tested against three endophytic fungi (Colletotrichum sp., Phomopsis sp., and Guignardia manguifera) isolated from the same plant species (C acuminata, Verbenaceae) and against four economically important phytopathogenic microorganisms (two fungoid oomycetes, Phythophtora capsici and Phythophtora parasitica, and the fungi Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria solani). Spiroketals 1-3 displayed significant growth inhibition against all the phytopathogens. IC50 values for the four phytopathogens were from 20 to 170 mu g/ml. Palmarumycin CP2 (4) was not bioactive against any of the fungi tested. Compound I showed the strongest bioactivity. The acetylated derivatives of preussornerin EG, (1), la and 1b, were obtained and their biological activity was tested on endophytes and phytopathogens.

We isolated endophytic fungi from the leaves of A. compressus and molecularly identified them as Fusarium parceramosum, Colletotrichum siamense, C. gigasporum, C. endophyticum, Curvularia lunata, Stagonospora bicolor, Calonectria gracilis, and Albifimbria verrucari. These fungal endophytes are considered host generalists, as they have been isolated from other plants and have also been reported to be latent plant pathogens. We tested the pathogenicity of selected endophytic fungal isolates on A. compressus leaves, chili (Capsicum annum), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and found that they were pathogenic to wounded A. compressus leaves with low to moderate virulence, and several were pathogenic to wounded and unwounded chili and tomato fruits. This indicated that the endophytes could infect both vegetable fruits with low to very high virulence. Pathogenicity tests demonstrated that endophytic fungi from the leaves of A. compressus can become pathogenic and infect the host and other plant species. The findings also indicated that leaves of A. compressus may harbor pathogens with latent ability that can become active due to changes in environmental conditions, thereby disrupting the balance between host-endophyte antagonism.",Molecular identification of endophytic fungi in lawn grass (<i>Axonopus compressus</i>) and their pathogenic ability,"Azuddin, NF; Azmy, MSMN; Zakaria, L",NA,NA,NA,"Azuddin, Nurul Farizah; Azmy, Mohamad Syahril Mohamad Noor; Zakaria, Latiffah",NA,NA,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Azuddin, Nurul Farizah/AAV-7012-2021; Zakaria, Latiffah/AAQ-4990-2021","Azuddin, Nurul Farizah/0000-0002-3638-3993",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2045-2322,NA,NA,NA,NA,14-Mar,2023,13,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1038/s41598-023-31291-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-31291-7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36918601,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000984342100025,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4961

The fungi were grouped according to their morphology, and subjected to DNA sequence comparisons of the ribosomal ITS region. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the fungal isolates were grouped in Sordariomycetes and Dothideomycetes (Ascomycota). Species of Xylariales were the most common fungi associated with K. anthotheca. The results of this study indicate that K. anthotheca serves as a host to numerous endophytic fungi.

Various physiological, biochemical, and molecular machineries are employed by the plants to overcome these stresses. Endophytes are mostly the symbiotic fungi and bacteria that reside inside the plant tissue and stimulate plant growth during stress conditions. Endophyte-mediated plant stress tolerance holds significant role in the analysis of plant-microbe interactions. Although still at its infancy, the endophyte-mediated host stress tolerance including drought, salinity, high-temperature stresses, and pathogenic infection has been well described in the recent times. The molecular mechanism governing the endophyte-mediated stress response includes the induction of plant stress genes and regulation of reactive oxygen species. In the present review, we discuss the evidences for bacterial and fungal endophyte-mediated stress tolerance and associated mechanisms.

In this study, we isolated an endophytic fungus from the leaves of Otoba gracilipes, a medicinal tree from a tropical rainforest in Colombia. Following isolation and cultivation, we evaluated its extracellular crude extract for antioxidant activity. Using traditional and molecular methods (ITS1, NL1 regions), the endophyte was identified as Fusarium oxysporum. Fresh spores from the fungal isolate were inoculated in liquid media (potato dextrose broth [PDB] and potato dextrose-yeast extract broth [PDYB]) and centrifuged for recovering extracellular polysaccharides from the exhausted medium after 30 days of cultivation. Crude extracts were recovered, purified, lyophilized, and evaluated for their ability to inactivate the free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). The extracts obtained from PDB culture media had a 51.5% of scavenging effect on DPPH after 5 min of reaction compared with the extracts from PDBY (26.4%), which suggests a high antioxidant potential of these fungal extracts.

2652,,"Endophytic fungi and phytophagous insects derive energy from shared host plants, and so are likely to interact with one another. Several authors have proposed that fungal endophytes of woody perennials, like endophytes of grasses, have a mutualistic association with their host and provide enhanced protection from herbivory. However, there have been few tests of this hypothesis, and most studies have focused on correlating the presence of endophytes and herbivores. We investigated a system where an endophyte was known to cause significant mortality on one species of gall-forming insect (Besbicus mirabilis), but not another (Bassettia ligni) that occupies the same plant host. We predicted that gall insects should avoid high-endophyte space and that mortality would be lowest in low-endophyte space if endophytes protect plants from herbivory. We used the spatial location, temporal infection patterns, and within-leaf growth activity of the endophyte as elements of endophyte space. Besbicus mirabilis avoided high-endophyte space at the within-leaf scale by occupying part of the leaf where endophyte infection and endophyte-caused mortality were predictably low. However, the within-leaf position was under opposing selection pressure from mortality caused by grazing herbivores and developmental constraints, so the gall did not occupy the region of the leaf where both infection and endophyte-caused mortality were the lowest. B. ligni was spatially correlated within leaves with the presence of the endophyte but suffered almost no endophyte-caused mortality. However, B. ligni occupies the leaf lamina, where the endophyte has no growth activity, in contrast to the leaf midrib, where B. mirabilis galls are found. Further, B. ligni emerges from the gall just as endophyte infection levels reach a peak, so this species temporally avoids prolonged contact with highly infected tissue. However, the between-leaf distributions of both insects were independent of endophyte infection. Fungal endophytes influence the spatial patterns of insect distributions, but at different scales. Growth activity of the endophyte may also play a role, and simply examining presence/absence correlations of insects may be misleading.",Avoidance of high-endophyte space by gall-forming insects,"Wilson, D; Carroll, GC",NA,NA,NA,"Wilson, D; Carroll, GC",NA,NA,ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0012-9658,NA,NA,NA,NA,OCT,1997,78,7,NA,NA,NA,2153,2163,10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[2153:AOHESB]2.0.CO;2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(1997)078[2153:AOHESB]2.0.CO;2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1997XZ78900019,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2652
4251,,"Heavy metal contamination in soil is increasing rapidly due to increasing anthropogenic activities. Despite the importance of rose-scented geranium as a medicinal plant, little attention was paid to enhancing its productivity in heavy metal-polluted soil. In this regard, endophytes improve plant resistance to heavy metal toxicity and enhance its tissue quality. Here, the impact of the three endophytic fungi Talaromyces versatilis (E6651), Emericella nidulans (E6658), and Aspergillus niger (E6657) on geranium growth, tolerance, and tissue quality under cadmium (Cd) stress was investigated. In contrast to E. nidulans, T. versatilis and A. niger enhanced geranium growth and the stimulatory effect was more pronounced under Cd-stress. The three endophytes significantly alleviated Cd accumulation and increased mineral content in geranium leaves. In addition, endophytic fungi successfully alleviated Cd-induced membrane damage and reinforced the antioxidant defenses in geranium leaves. Inoculation with endophytes stimulated all the antioxidant enzymes under Cd-stress, and the response was more obvious in the case of T. versatilis and A. niger. To reduce the toxicity of tissue-Cd levels, T. versatilis and A. niger upregulated the detoxification mechanisms; glutathione-S-transferase, phytochelatin, and metallothionein levels. Moreover, endophytic fungi improved the medicinal value and quality of geranium by increasing total antioxidant capacity (TAC), phenolic compound biosynthesis (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase), and vitamin content as well as the quantity and quality of essential oil, particularly under Cd-stress conditions. The variation in the mechanisms modulated by the different endophytic fungi was supported by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Overall, this study provided fundamental insights into endophytes' impact as a feasible strategy to mitigate the phytotoxicity hazards of Cd-stress in geranium and enhance its quality, based on the growth and biochemical investigations.","Harnessing Endophytic Fungi for Enhancing Growth, Tolerance and Quality of Rose-Scented Geranium (<i>Pelargonium graveolens</i> (L'Her) Thunb.)

1323,,"Background: Taxol is an anti-cancer drug harvested from Taxus trees, proposed ecologically to act as a fungicide. Taxus is host to fungal endophytes, defined as organisms that inhabit plants without causing disease. The Taxus endophytes have been shown to synthesize Taxol in vitro, providing Taxus with a second potential biosynthetic route for this protective metabolite. Taxol levels in plants vary 125-fold between individual trees, but the underlying reason has remained unknown. Results: Comparing Taxus trees or branches within a tree, correlations were observed between Taxol content, and quantity of its resident Taxol-producing endophyte, Paraconiothyrium SSM001. Depletion of fungal endophyte in planta by fungicide reduced plant Taxol accumulation. Fungicide treatment of intact plants caused concomitant decreases in transcript and/or protein levels corresponding to two critical genes required for plant Taxol biosynthesis. Taxol showed fungicidal activity against fungal pathogens of conifer wood, the natural habitat of the Taxol-producing endophyte. Consistent with other Taxol-producing endophytes, SSM001 was resistant to Taxol. Conclusions: These results suggest that the variation in Taxol content between intact Taxus plants and/or tissues is at least in part caused by varying degrees of transcriptional elicitation of plant Taxol biosynthetic genes by its Taxol-producing endophyte. As Taxol is a fungicide, and the endophyte is resistant to Taxol, we discuss how this endophyte strategy may be to prevent colonization by its fungal competitors but at minimal metabolic cost to itself.",A fungal endophyte induces transcription of genes encoding a redundant fungicide pathway in its host plant,"Soliman, SSM; Trobacher, CP; Tsao, R; Greenwood, JS; Raizada, MN",NA,NA,NA,"Soliman, Sameh S.

In this study, we analysed the effect of nine P. chlamydosporia isolates from worldwide origin on tomato growth. Experiments were performed at different scales (Petri dish, growth chamber and greenhouse conditions) and developmental stages (seedlings, plantlets and plants). Seven P. chlamydosporia isolates significantly (P < 0.05) increased the number of secondary roots and six of those increased total weight of tomato seedlings. Six P. chlamydosporia isolates also increased root weight of tomato plantlets. Root colonisation varied between different isolates of this fungus. Again P. chlamydosporia significantly increased root growth of tomato plants under greenhouse conditions and reduced flowering and fruiting times (up to 5 and 12 days, respectively) versus uninoculated tomato plants. P. chlamydosporia increased mature fruit weight in tomato plants. The basis of the mechanisms for growth, flowering and yield promotion in tomato by the fungus are unknown. However, we found that P. chlamydosporia can produce Indole-3-acetic acid and solubilise mineral phosphate. These results suggest that plant hormones or nutrient ability could play an important role.

599,,"Aims: This study was aimed to screen and isolate soil and endophytic fungi with the ability to biosynthesize stable silver nanoparticles (SNPs) with antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities. Methodology and results: A total of 60 fungal isolates isolated from soil and plant samples were screened for their ability to biosynthesize SNPs. Among which, 21 isolates have supported the biosynthesis of SNPs. Furthermore, the endophytic isolate PRR2.1 synthesized highly thermostable SNPs with long shelf life. The PRR2.1 isolate was identified as Albifimbria verrucaria by morphological and molecular means. The synthesis of SNPs was initially monitored by UV-Vis spectroscopy. Further characterization by transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and dynamic light scattering revealed well-dispersed spherical crystalline in nature SNPs with a mean size of 14 nm and zeta potential of - 24.47 mV. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed the presence of biomolecules adsorbed on the surface of biosynthesized SNPs responsible for their synthesis and stability. The mycosynthesized SNPs exhibited stronger antifungal activity against pathogenic strains of Aspergillus niger, A. flavus, A. fumigatus and Candida albicans with respect to its antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Klebsiella pneumoniae compared to standard antifungal itraconazole and antibiotic cefadroxil with mostly consistent minimum inhibitory concentration of 5.31 mu g/mL. The biosynthesized SNPs demonstrated dose-dependent in vitro antiproliferative activity against cancerous HeLa cell line with ICso value of 2.52 mu g/mL and less cytotoxic activity against WI-38 (normal human lung fibroblasts) cell line with CCso value of 10.2 mu g/mL.

The aim of the study was to find new cytotoxic and antibacterial metabolites from endophytic fungus, Cladosporium sp. isolated from the leaves of Rauwolfia serpentina (L.) Benth. ex Kurz. (Fam: Apocyanaceae). Materials and methods The endophytic fungus was grown on potato dextrose agar medium and extracted using ethyl acetate. Secondary metabolites were isolated by chromatographic separation and re-crystallization, and structures were confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectroscopic data. The cytotoxicity was determined by WST-1 assay and brine shrimp lethality bioassay, while antibacterial activity was assessed by disc diffusion method. Results Two naphthoquinones, namely anhydrofusarubin (1) and methyl ether of fusarubin (2), were isolated from Cladosporium sp. The isolated compounds 1 and 2, by WST-1 assay against human leukemia cells (K-562) showed potential cytotoxicity with IC50 values of 3.97 μg/mL and 3.58 μg/mL, respectively. Initial screening of crude ethyl acetate extract and column fractions F-8 and F-10 exhibited noticeable cytotoxicity to brine shimp nauplii with LC50 values of 42.8, 1.2 and 2.1 μg/mL, respectively. Moreover, the isolated compound 2 (40 μg/disc) showed prominent activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus megaterium with an average zone of inhibition of 27 mm, 25 mm, 24 mm and 22 mm, respectively and the activities were compared with kanamycin (30 μg/disc).

843,,"Angelica glauca Edgew. is an endangered medicinal plant species that is known for its roots containing valuable essential oil. It is overexploited for its roots and has become endangered and nearing its threshold. This study is aimed at exploring the endophytic fungal diversity associated with its roots to further study the conservation aspects with the help of the interaction of host plant species and endophytes. About 24 different root fungal endophyte species were isolated among which Geotrichum candidum (32.03 ± 7.95 %) was found to be the most dominant followed by Fusarium oxysporum (11.49 ± 21.69 %). The average root colonization of all the endophytes in all four collection fields was 61.195 ± 9.67 % wherein the maximum colonization was observed in wild root samples (74%) and the least root colonization by fungal endophytes was observed in two years old cultivated plants root system (52.36%). Positive Pearson’s correlation (r = 0.801) was observed between the samples/fields and root colonization by fungal endophytes, indicating the colonization increases in roots as the age of plant species advances. Both the Simpson’s Diversity Index (D) and Shannon Wiener diversity index (H) indicate relatively lower diversity in Field 3 (D = 0.43 & H = 1.07) and Field 4 (D = 0.57 & H = 0.97) i.e. in two years old plantations and wild plants. Menhinick Index (Dmn) and Margalef Richness Index (Mf) are based on species richness, and both of them indicate Field 3 (Dmn = 0.95 & Mf = 2.04) to be the richest. Both Buzas and Gibson’s Index (E) and Equitability Index (EH) are a measure of evenness and yield similar results viz. Field 1 (one year old plantations) (E = 0.65 & EH = 0.76) and Field 4 (E = 0.66 & EH = 0.70) being the most even in terms of species distribution. Berger-Parker Dominance Index (B) shows field 3 (B = 0.75) having the highest values. © 2021, MRF.

5909,,"Paclitaxel, better known as the anticancer drug Taxol (R), has been isolated from several plant species and has been shown to be produced by fungi, actinomycetes, and even bacteria isolated from marine macroalgae. Given its cytostatic effect, studies conducted in the 1990's showed that paclitaxel was toxic to many pathogenic fungi and oomycetes. Further studies led to the idea that the differences in paclitaxel sensitivity exhibited by different fungi were due to differences in the p-tubulin protein sequence. With the recent isolation of endophytic fungi from the leaves and bark of the Himalayan Yew, Taxus wallichiana Zucc., and the availability of genomes from paclitaxel-producing fungi, we decided to further explore the idea that endophytic fungi isolated from Yews should be well-adapted to their environment by encoding13-tubulin proteins that are insensitive to paclitaxel. Our results found evidence of episodic positive/diversifying selection at 10 sites (default p-value threshold of 0.1) in the 1-tubulin sequences, corresponding to codon positions 33, 55, 172, 218, 279, 335, 359, 362, 379, and 406. Four of these positions (i.e., 172, 279, 359, and 362) have been implicated in the binding of paclitaxel by beta-tubulin or formed part of the binding pocket. As expected, all the fungal endophytes grew in different media regardless of the paclitaxel concentration tested. Furthermore, our results also showed that Taxomyces andreanae CBS 279.92, the first fungus shown to produce paclitaxel, is a Basidiomycete fungus as the two beta tubulins encoded by the fungus clustered together with other Basidiomycete fungi.","Taxol and β-tubulins from endophytic fungi isolated from the Himalayan Yew, <i>Taxus wallichiana</i> Zucc.","Velez, H; Gauchan, DP; Garcia-Gil, MD",NA,NA,NA,"Velez, Heriberto; Gauchan, Dhurva Prasad; Garcia-Gil, Maria del Rosario",NA,NA,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"García-Gil, M/E-5093-2016; Heriberto, Vélëz/GSN-0109-2022","Garcia Gil, Rosario/0000-0002-6834-6708",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-302X,NA,NA,NA,29-Sep,2022,13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3389/fmicb.2022.956855,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.956855,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36246258,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000868537000001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5909
556,,"Aims Epichloë infection can play an important role in the growth and development of host plants. However, few studies have been reported on the effects of endophyte infection on leaf shape and area of host plants. Methods Our study used Achnatherum sibiricum as experimental material, and explored the effects of endophyte species and host plant genotype on the leaf shape and area of A. sibiricum-endophyte symbionts through the combination of the length and width method with the revised correction coefficient and the scanning calculation method. Important findings Endophyte infection status, endophyte species and host plant genotype had no significant influences on the correction coefficient of leaf size calculation, leaf length, leaf width and leaf length-width ratio reflecting leaf shape. By calculation and verification, we determined that the correction coefficient of leaf size calculation of A. sibiricum was 0.594 9. There was no significant difference between the leaf areas measured by length and width method with the revised correction coefficient and the scanning calculation method. In addition, the leaf areas measured by two methods were not significantly affected by endophyte infection, endophyte species and plant maternal genotype. © 2020 Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology.

8848,,"This review highlights recent findings of our group on bioactive marine natural products isolated from marine sponges and marine derived fungi. The activated chemical defence of the Mediterranean sponge Aplysina aerophoba is introduced as an example of a dynamic response of marine sponges to wounding. Following tissue disrupture preformed brominated isoxazoline alkaloids are enzymatically cleaved and thereby give rise to aeroplysinin-1 which is believed to protect sponges from invasion of pathogenic bacteria. A preliminary characterization of the membrane bound enzyme(s) involved in the cleavage reaction is presented. Bromotyrosine derived, oxime group bearing peptides, the so called bastadins, obtained from the sponge Ianthella basta and some of their synthetic derivatives were shown to exhibit pronounced antifouling activity against larvae of the barnacle Balanus improvisus. The antifouling activity could be traced to the oxime group as an important pharmacophore that was also found to be present in other sponge derived natural products exhibiting antifouling activity. Marine derived fungi that reside within invertebrates such as sponges or inside Mangrove plants are emerging as a new source of bioactive metabolites as demonstrated for Aspergillus ustus and Alternaria sp. that were isolated from the sponge Suberites domuncula or from the Mangrove plant Sonneratia alba, respectively. The former fungus yielded new moderately cytotoxic sesquiterpenoids of the drimane type whereas the latter was found to produce polyketides such as alternariol that exhibited strong and selective inhibitory activity against several protein kinases, for instance Aurora A and B which are targets for anticancer chemotherapy.",Bioactive natural products from marine sponges and fungal endophytes,"Proksch, P; Putz, A; Ortlepp, S; Kjer, J; Bayer, M",NA,NA,NA,"Proksch, Peter; Putz, Annika; Ortlepp, Sofia; Kjer, Julia; Bayer, Mirko",NA,NA,PHYTOCHEMISTRY REVIEWS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Proksch, Peter/AAR-4593-2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1568-7767,1572-980X,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2010,9,4,NA,SI,NA,475,489,10.1007/s11101-010-9178-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11101-010-9178-9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000284072100001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8848

Fusarium sp., Rosellinia sanctae-cruciana and Cladosporium sp. was evaluated using an in vitro confrontation assay. A total of four endophytic fungi were isolated from the roots of E. larica. Among them, two fungal isolates (SQUCC-F1-1 and SQUCC-F6-2) showed inhibitory activity against Fusarium sp. None of the fungal endophytes restricted the growth of Rosellinia sanctae-cruciana and Cladosporium sp. On the basis of multi-gene phylogenetic analysis, these two endophytic fungi were identified as Neocosmospora sp. (SQUCC-F1-1) and Alternaria alternata (SQUCC-F6-2). Scanning electron microscopic observation of hyphae of the phytopathogenic fungi from the dual culture plate revealed morphological abnormalities such as loss of turgidity, shrinkage and disintegration of the hyphae. Analysis of the metabolites produced by these endophytic fungi by GC-MS revealed the existence of various fatty acids, fatty acid methyl esters, hydrocarbons and alkanes, which have been previously demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity.

5417,,"Most terrestrial plants establish symbiotic associations with microorganisms that enable them to overcome abiotic or biotic filters in ecosystems. Here we investigated how aerial mutualisms involving invasive species may affect the recipient community's structure. We hypothesized that the endophyte Epichloe occultans enhances the ability of Lolium multiflorum to establish and colonize, but that success would depend on the structure and invasion resistance of the recipient grassland community. Seeds of L. multiflorum with high (E+) and low (E-) endophyte incidence were sown in plots located in grasslands with or without recent grazing history. Relative cover of L. multiflorum and floristic groups was determined during the growing season. Whereas we did not detect any endophyte effect in sites with grazing history, L. multiflorum cover was 63 % in E+ and 27 % in E- plots in sites without grazing history. As cover of L. multiflorum increased in these sites, the cover of warm- and cool-season grasses decreased in spring, with that of warm-season grasses continuing to decrease in summer. These decreases corresponded to 1.9, 3.7 and 1.6 %, for every % increase of L. multiflorum cover. Path analysis and posterior modelling predicted a greater impact of the endophyte on L. multiflorum cover than of seed addition when resident L. multiflorum cover was <= 20 %. This effect decreased asymptotically as L. multiflorum cover increased beyond 20 %. Our results suggest that the endophyte may boost the invasion ability of L. multiflorum particularly in natural grassland without grazing history with potential longer-term consequences for community structure and dynamics.",The enhancement of invasion ability of an annual grass by its fungal endophyte depends on recipient community structure,"Casas, C; Gundel, PE; Semmartin, M; Schnyder, H; Omacini, M",NA,NA,NA,"Casas, Cecilia; Gundel, Pedro E.; Semmartin, Maria; Schnyder, Hans; Omacini, Marina",NA,NA,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Schnyder, Hans/B-7089-2011","Schnyder, Hans/0000-0002-0139-7535; Casas, Cecilia/0000-0003-3538-6081; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Omacini, Marina/0000-0003-1460-262X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1387-3547,1573-1464,NA,NA,NA,JUL,2016,18,7,NA,NA,NA,1853,1865,10.1007/s10530-016-1129-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1129-y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000378816500005,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5417
3300,,"Epichloe festucae forms mutualistic symbiotic interactions with grasses of the Loliurn and Festuca genera. Protection from insect and mammalian herbivory are the best-documented host benefits of these associations. The two main classes of anti-mammalian alkaloids synthesized by E. festucae are the ergot alkaloids and indole diterpenes, of which ergovaline and lolitrems are the principal terminal products. Synthesis of both metabolites require multiple gene products encoded by clusters of 11 genes located at the subtelomeric regions of chromosomes I and III respectively. These loci are essentially unexpressed in axenic culture but among the most highly expressed genes in planta. We show here that heterochromatin 1 protein (HepA) is an important component of the regulatory machinery that maintains these loci in a silent state in culture. Deletion of this gene led to derepression of eas and km gene expression under non-symbiotic culture conditions. Although there was no obvious culture phenotype, RNAseq analysis revealed that around 1000 genes were differentially expressed in the Delta hepA mutant compared to wild type with just one-third upregulated. Inoculation of the Delta hepA mutants into seedlings of Lolitun perenne led to a severe host interaction phenotype characterized by a reduction in tiller length but an increase in tiller number. Hyphae within the leaves of these associations were much more abundant in the intercellular spaces of the leaves and aberrantly colonized the vascular bundles. This physiological change was accompanied by a dramatic change in the transcriptome with around 900 genes differentially expressed, with two thirds of these upregulated. This major physiological change was accompanied by a decrease in ltm gene expression and loss of the ability to synthesize lolitrems. These results show that HepA has an important role in controlling the chromatin state of these sub-telomeric secondary metabolite genes, including their symbiosis-specific regulation.",Complex epigenetic regulation of alkaloid biosynthesis and host interaction by heterochromatin protein I in a fungal endophyte-plant symbiosis,"Chujo, T; Lukito, Y; Eaton, CJ; Dupont, PY; Johnson, LJ; Winter, D; Cox, MP; Scott, B",NA,NA,NA,"Chujo, Tetsuya; Lukito, Yonathan; Eaton, Carla J.; Dupont, Pierre-Yves; Johnson, Linda J.; Winter, David; Cox, Murray P.; Scott, Barry",NA,NA,FUNGAL GENETICS AND BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cox, Murray/A-1459-2012; Eaton, Carla/J-3108-2013; Winter, David/M-9658-2017","Lukito, Yonathan/0000-0001-8616-6391; Scott, Barry/0000-0002-2224-2946; Dupont, Pierre-Yves/0000-0002-7384-5181; Eaton, Carla/0000-0002-0633-1535; Winter, David/0000-0002-6165-0029",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1087-1845,1096-0937,NA,NA,NA,APR,2019,125,NA,NA,NA,NA,71,83,10.1016/j.fgb.2019.02.001,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fgb.2019.02.001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30731202,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000463311000008,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3300
1,,"                             A dominant bioflavonoid-rutin was isolated from the fermentation broth of endophytic Aspergillus flavus obtained from Aegle marmelos. A simple, rapid and reliable High-Performance Thin-Layer Chromatographic (HPTLC) method was developed for the analysis of rutin. HPTLC was carried out for qualitative determination of flavonoids in the fermentation broth using silica gel 60 F                             254                              20×20cm thickly plated preparative chromatography plates as a stationary phase and ethyl acetate, glacial acetic acid and formic acid (5:0.5:1, v/v) as mobile phase. The plates were scanned densitometrically between 200 and 700 nm. The fermentation extract of the endophytic Aspergillus flavus produced metabolite and showed a compact and well resolved blue band with the same R                             f                              (0.32±0.02) to that of authentic rutin. The bioactive metabolite produced by endophytic fungi is generally less than their host plant. However, in this study, the flavonoids were easily detected with HPTLC indicating more production of the metabolite. The present study demonstrates a new method to produce, isolate and analyze flavonoids by fungal fermentation, which could overcome the extensive use of the host plant.                          © 2014, © 2014, Har Krishan Bhalla & Sons.",Isolation and HPTLC Densitometric Analysis of Rutin in the Broth Extract of Endophytic Aspergilluis flavus from Aegle marmelos,Patil R.H.; Patil M.P.; Maheshwari V.L.,NA,,NA,"Patil, R.H.

1123,,"Background Spot blotch is a serious foliar disease of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) plants caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana, which is a hemibiotrophic ascomycete that has a global impact on productivity. Some Trichoderma spp. is a promising candidate as a biocontrol agent as well as a plant growth stimulant. Also, the application of nanomaterials in agriculture limits the use of harmful agrochemicals and helps improve the yield of different crops. The current study was carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of Trichoderma. cf. asperellum and the biosynthesized titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) to manage the spot blotch disease of barley caused by B. sorokiniana and to assess the plant's innate defense response. Results Aloe vera L. aqueous leaf extract was used to biosynthesize TiO(2 )NPs by reducing TiCl(4 )salt into TiO2 NPs and the biosynthesized NPs were detected using SEM and TEM. It was confirmed that the NPs are anatase-crystalline phases and exist in sizes ranging from 10 to 25 nm. The T. cf. asperellum fungus was detected using morphological traits and rDNA ITS analysis. This fungus showed strong antagonistic activity against B. sorokiniana (57.07%). Additionally, T. cf. asperellum cultures that were 5 days old demonstrated the best antagonistic activity against the pathogen in cell-free culture filtrate. Also, B. sorokiniana was unable to grow on PDA supplemented with 25 and 50 mg/L of TiO2 NPs, and the diameter of the inhibitory zone increased with increasing TiO2 NPs concentration. In an in vivo assay, barley plants treated with T. cf. asperellum or TiO2 NPs were used to evaluate their biocontrol efficiency against B. sorokiniana, in which T. cf. asperellum and TiO2 NPs enhanced the growth of the plant without displaying disease symptoms. Furthermore, the physiological and biochemical parameters of barley plants treated with T. cf. asperellum or TiO2 NPs in response to B. sorokiniana treatment were quantitively estimated. Hence, T. cf. asperellum and TiO2 NPs improve the plant's tolerance and reduce the growth inhibitory effect of B. sorokiniana. Conclusion Subsequently, T. cf. asperellum and TiO2 NPs were able to protect barley plants against B. sorokiniana via enhancement of chlorophyll content, improvement of plant health, and induction of the barley innate defense system. The present work emphasizes the major contribution of T. cf. asperellum and the biosynthesized TiO2 NPs to the management of spot blotch disease in barley plants, and ultimately to the enhancement of barley plant quality and productivity.",<i>Trichoderma</i> cf. <i>asperellum</i> and plant-based titanium dioxide nanoparticles initiate morphological and biochemical modifications in <i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L. against <i>Bipolaris sorokiniana</i>,"Metwally, RA; Soliman, SA; Abdalla, H; Abdelhameed, RE",NA,NA,NA,"Metwally, Rabab A.; Soliman, Shereen A.; Abdalla, Hanan; Abdelhameed, Reda E.",NA,NA,BMC PLANT BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hameed, Reda/AAR-2820-2021; Metwally, Rabab/AAR-5456-2020","Abdelhameed, Reda E./0000-0003-4485-5898",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1471-2229,NA,NA,NA,NA,17-Feb,2024,24,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1186/s12870-024-04785-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12870-024-04785-3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38368386,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001163769300001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1123
1454,,"Beneficial interactions between plants and microorganisms have been investigated under different ecological, physiological, biochemical, and genetic aspects. However, the systematic exploration of biomolecules with potential for biotechnological products from this interaction still is relatively scarce. Therefore, this study aimed the evaluation of the diversity and antimicrobial activity of the endophytic fungi obtained from roots, stems and leafs of Myrcia guianensis (Myrtaceae) from the Brazilian Amazon. 156 endophytic fungi were isolated and above 80% were identified by morphological examination as belonging to the genera Pestalotiopsis, Phomopsis, Aspergillus, Xylaria, Nectria, Penicillium and Fusarium. Fermented broth of those fungi were assayed for antimicrobial activity and four inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans and Penicillium avellaneum. As the strain named MgRe2.2.3B (Nectria haematococca) had shown the most promising results against those pathogenic strains, its fermented broth was fractioned and only its two low polar fractions demonstrated to be active. Both fractions exhibited a minimum bactericidal concentration of 50 mu g.mL(-1) against S. aureus and a minimum fungicidal concentration of 100 mu g.mL(-1) against P. avellaneum.

6472,,"Poisonous plants cause large losses to the livestock industry through death, reduced production efficiency, reproductive dysfunction, and compromised harvesting of rangeland and pasture forages. Research investigating poisonous plants is complex because there are hundreds of genera of toxic plants representing thousands of species. To investigate the effects of poisonous plants on livestock, a clear understanding of the taxonomic identity of the plant and the ability to collect the plant in sufficient quantities for scientific studies is required. Subsequently, the active principles must be defined and investigated in the taxa of interest to better predict risk and make recommendations to reduce losses. Herbaria are collections of preserved plant specimens and are an important resource in poisonous plant research. Voucher specimens have often been used in the identification of the plant for the experimental reproduction of suspected livestock poisoning associated with a spontaneous case. More recently, herbarium specimens have been used to investigate the chemical composition of toxic plants as well as the distribution of different chemotypes over the landscape. The primary purpose of this review is to highlight the chemical analysis of herbarium specimens in poisonous plant research.",Use of Herbarium Voucher Specimens To Investigate Phytochemical Composition in Poisonous Plant Research,"Cook, D; Lee, ST; Gardner, DR; Molyneux, RJ; Johnson, RL; Taylor, CM",NA,NA,NA,"Cook, Daniel; Lee, Stephen T.; Gardner, Dale R.; Molyneux, Russell J.; Johnson, Robert L.; Taylor, Charlotte M.",NA,NA,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Taylor, Charlotte/KPB-8248-2024","Gardner, Dale/0000-0003-3218-6893",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0021-8561,1520-5118,NA,NA,NA,14-Apr,2021,69,14,NA,NA,NA,4037,4047,10.1021/acs.jafc.1c00708,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c00708,NA,Apr-21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33797894,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000641158400001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6472
6984,,"Since the dawn of civilization, natural resources have remained the mainstay of various remedial approaches of humans vis-a-vis a large number of illnesses. Saraca asoca (Roxb.) de Wilde (Saraca indica L.) belonging to the family Caesalpiniaceae has been regarded as a universal panacea in old Indian Ayurvedic texts and has especially been used to manage gynaecological complications and infections besides treating haemmorhagic dysentery, uterine pain, bacterial infections, skin problems, tumours, worm infestations, cardiac and circulatory problems. Almost all parts of the plant are considered pharmacologically valuable. Extensive folkloric practices and ethnobotanical applications of this plant have even lead to the availability of several commercial S. asoca formulations recommended for different indications though adulteration of these remains a pressing concern. Though a wealth of knowledge on this plant is available in both the classical and modern literature, extensive research on its phytomedicinal worth using state-of-the-art tools and methodologies is lacking. Recent reports on bioprospecting of S. asoca endophytic fungi for industrial bioproducts and useful pharmacologically relevant metabolites provide a silver lining to uncover single molecular bio-effectors from its endophytes. Here, we describe socio-ethnobotanical usage, present the current pharmacological status and discuss potential bottlenecks in harnessing the proclaimed phytomedicinal worth of this prescribed Ayurvedic medicinal plant. Finally, we also look into the possible future of the drug discovery and pharmaceutical R&D efforts directed at exploring its pharma legacy.","Phytomedicinal importance of <i>Saraca asoca</i> (Ashoka): an exciting past, an emerging present and a promising future","Singh, S; Krishna, THA; Kamalraj, S; Kuriakose, GC; Valayil, JM; Jayabaskaran, C",NA,NA,NA,"Singh, Satpal; Krishna, T.

2327,,"Emergent records propose that Aspergillus niger endophytic fungus is a vital source for various bioactive molecules possessing many biological properties. The current study was designed to inspect the antibacterial and anti-Toxoplasma potentials of Ficus retusa-derived endophytic fungi. After isolation and identification (using 18S rRNA gene sequencing) of A. niger endophytic fungus, LC/MS was utilized for identification and authentication of the chemical profile of the A. niger endophyte extract. Then, the fungal extract was assessed for its antibacterial and antibiofilm activities against Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates. Additionally, its efficacy against Toxoplasma gondii was elucidated in vivo. The fungal extract displayed antibacterial activity against K. pneumoniae isolates with minimum inhibitory concentration values of 64–512 µg/mL. It also possessed a membrane potential dissipating effect using flow cytometry. Moreover, it formed distorted cells with rough surfaces and deformed shapes using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Regarding its antibiofilm activity, it resulted in a dysregulation of the genes encoding biofilm formation (fimH, mrkA and mrkD) using qRT-PCR in nine K. pneumoniae isolates. The in vivo anti-Toxoplasma potential was demonstrated by decreasing the mortality rate of mice and reducing the tachyzoites’ count in the peritoneal fluids and liver impression smears of mice. In addition, the deformities of the parasite decreased, as revealed by SEM and the inflammation in tissues diminished. Thus, A. niger endophytic fungi could be a valuable source of antibacterial and anti-Toxoplasma compounds. © 2023 The Author(s).

1880,,"Communities of fungal endophytes from roots, stems and leaves of the introduced grass Hyparrhenia hirta (Coolatai grass) and the native species Bothriochloa macra (redgrass) were compared at two sites to identify characteristics that may be associated with invasiveness of H. hirta. The most frequently isolated fungi from both hosts were species of Nigrospora, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Phoma, Epicoccum, Fusarium and Periconia. Most of these occurred at a similar frequency in the two hosts, although Nigrospora sphaerica was much more frequently isolated from H. hirta at both sites. There was little support for the hypothesis that the introduced species (H. hirta) would have a less diverse endophyte community than the native species. There was a greater degree of dominance by the most frequent species in communities from H. hirta than from B. macra, leading to lower diversity indices, but no significant difference in species richness. Cluster analysis of the endophyte communities suggested that host had a greater influence than site on community structure, and that this was expressed mostly in the relative frequency of fungi isolated from stems and leaves, with very similar fungal communities present in the roots of both species at both sites. Analysis of co-occurrence showed no evidence that competition among fungi affected community structure within individual plants. The dominance of N. sphaerica in H. hirta was therefore due to fungus - plant interactions rather than fungus - fungus interactions. Interactions with N. sphaerica could potentially affect the population ecology of H. hirta.",Comparison of fungal endophyte communities in the invasive panicoid grass <i>Hyparrhenia hirta</i> and the native grass <i>Bothriochloa macra</i>,"White, IR; Backhouse, D",NA,NA,NA,"White, Ian R.; Backhouse, David",NA,NA,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"White, Ian/AAE-1759-2021; Backhouse, David/A-5287-2008","Backhouse, David/0000-0003-0663-6002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0067-1924,1444-9862,NA,NA,NA,NA,2007,55,2,NA,NA,NA,178,185,10.1071/BT06125,http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/BT06125,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000244949800008,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1880
