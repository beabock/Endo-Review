175,23,"Absence","Native and exotic haplotypes of Phragmites australis show differential susceptibility to herbivores, but the mechanisms behind these differences are not known. Endophytic fungi are common in the grass family and confer resistance against insects through the production of toxic chemicals. We used both a common endophyte-staining technique and interference contrast microscopy to analyze leaf sheaths of native and exotic P. australis haplotypes from several populations in the northeastern United States to determine if the various haplotypes were infected with endophytes. No endophytes were found in any of the native and exotic haplotypes using procedures that consistently detected endophytes in infected rye grass.","Lambert, AM; Casagrande, RA",NA,NA,NA,"Lambert, Adam M.; Casagrande, Richard A.",NA,"No evidence of fungal endophytes in native and exotic <i>Phragmites australis</i>","NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"LAMBERT, Adam/0000-0001-7035-1787",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1092-6194","1938-5307",NA,NA,NA,NA,2006,"13","4",NA,NA,NA,"561","568",NA,"10.1656/1092-6194(2006)13[561:NEOFEI]2.0.CO;2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/1092-6194(2006)13[561:NEOFEI]2.0.CO;2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000243845400010",NA,"Absence","label_loose",NA,NA

6765,2049,NA,"Dark septate endophytes (DSEs) represent a diverse group of root-endophytic fungi that have been isolated from plant roots in many different natural and anthropogenic ecosystems. Melanin is widespread in eukaryotic organisms and possesses various functions such as protecting human skin from UV radiation, affecting the virulence of pathogens, and playing a role in development and physiology of insects. Melanin is a distinctive feature of the cell walls of DSEs and has been thought to protect these fungi from abiotic stress. Melanin in DSEs is assumed to be synthesized via the 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) pathway. Its function in alleviation of salt stress is not yet known. The aims of this study were: (i) investigating the growth responses of three DSEs (Periconia macrospinosa, Cadophora sp., and Leptodontidium sp.) to salt stress, (ii) analyzing melanin production under salt stress and, (iii) testing the role of melanin in salt stress tolerance of DSEs. The study shows that the three DSE species can tolerate high salt concentrations. Melanin content increased in the hyphae of all DSEs at 100 mM salt, but decreased at 500 mM. This was not reflected in the RNA accumulation of the gene encoding scytalone dehydratase which is involved in melanin biosynthesis. The application of tricyclazole, a DHN-melanin biosynthesis inhibitor, did not affect either salt stress tolerance or the accumulation of sodium in the hyphae. In addition, melanin biosynthesis mutants of Leptodontidium sp. did not show decreased growth performance compared to the wild-type, especially not at high salt concentrations. This indicates that DSEs can live under salt stress and withstand these conditions regardless of melanin accumulation.","Gaber, DA; Berthelot, C; Camehl, I; Kovács, GM; Blaudez, D; Franken, P",NA,NA,NA,"Gaber, Dalia A.; Berthelot, Charlotte; Camehl, Iris; Kovacs, Gabor M.; Blaudez, Damien; Franken, Philipp",NA,"Salt Stress Tolerance of Dark Septate Endophytes Is Independent of Melanin Accumulation","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Blaudez, Damien/AAF-6517-2020; Mahmoud, Dalia/KBC-7667-2024","Blaudez, Damien/0000-0003-3287-3482; A.

This study was designed to determine the influence of endophyte genotype on the ability of tall fescue to mobilize inorganic phosphorus (Pi) from four Pi sources (KH2PO4 [K-Ps], FePO4 [Fe-Ps], AlPO4 [Al-Ps] and Ca-3(PO4)(2) [Ca-Ps]). Tall fescue infected with three different endophytes (CTE+, AR542E+, and AR584E+) and endophyte free (E-) were grown in growth media amended with four P sources at three P levels (control, low 0.31 mg/L, and high 31 mg/L) for 3 wk after which root system architecture, P uptake, and dry biomass were determined. The P source and P concentration had the most influence on plant growth and P uptake. Endophyte and the interaction between P source and endophyte strongly influenced shoot and total dry mass in P-limiting conditions. Greater P uptake was found in plants grown with Ca-Ps compared to the other Pi sources and control treatments, regardless of P level and endophyte status. Endophyte-infection, irrespective of type, resulted in more plant biomass (dry matter, DM) than non-infected tall fescue in low K-P treatment. Longer roots, greater surface area and root/shoot ratio in high Fe-Ps level than those in other P treatments, but lower P uptake were observed, regardless of endophyte status.

Endophytic fungi play a very important role such that some endophytes are host specific and others just reside in it. In this study, one of the frequently recurring endophytic fungi isolated were identified as Pesatloptiopsis breviseta. The maximum absorbance was recorded at 302 nm in the UV spectra. The peaks above 3000-3400 cm-1 in the FT-IR analysis, confirms the existence of free OH, NH, and NO2 groups. The presence of peaks at 1900-2900 cm-1 confirms the presence of alkyl groups attached to an aromatic moiety and confirms the presence of a double bond in the compound. The peak at 1965 cm-1 confirms the presence of unsaturation in the molecule. The NMR spectra confirm the presence of an aromatic compound. GC-MS analysis showed the maximum m/z valve at 15.5 retention time followed by 23.38 and 18.92 correspond to the compounds Neoisolongifolane, hydroxy-, 1, 2-Benzenedicarboxylic acid, mono(2-ethylhexyl) ester and 8-Octadecenoic acid, methyl ester respectively.

Nature continues to be the most prolific source of biologically active and diverse chemotypes, and it is becoming increasingly evident that associated microbes may often be the source of biologically active compounds originally isolated from host macro-organisms. While relatively few of the actual isolated compounds advance to become clinically effective drugs in their own right, these unique molecules may serve as models for the preparation of more efficacious analogs using chemical methodology such as total or combinatorial (parallel) synthesis, or manipulation of biosynthetic pathways. In addition, conjugation of toxic natural molecules to monoclonal antibodies or polymeric carriers specifically targeted to epitopes on tumors of interest can lead to the development of efficacious targeted therapies.

24177,8025,NA,"The genetically tractable endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica is able to colonize the root cortex of a great variety of different plant species with beneficial effects to its hosts, and it represents a suitable model system to study symbiotic interactions. Recent cytological studies in barley and Arabidopsis showed that, upon penetration of the root, P. indica establishes a biotrophic interaction during which fungal cells are encased by the host plasma membrane. Large-scale transcriptional analyses of fungal and plant responses have shown that perturbance of plant hormone homeostasis and secretion of fungal lectins and other small proteins (effectors) may be involved in the evasion and suppression of host defenses at these early colonization steps. At later stages, P. indica is found more often in moribund host cells where it secretes a large variety of hydrolytic enzymes that degrade proteins. This strategy of colonizing plants is reminiscent of that of hemibiotrophic fungi, although a defined shift to necrotrophy with massive host cell death is missing. Instead, the association with the plant root leads to beneficial effects for the host such as growth promotion, increased resistance to root as well as leaf pathogens, and increased tolerance to abiotic stresses. This review describes current advances in understanding the components of the P. indica endophytic lifestyle from molecular and genomic analyses.","Lahrmann, U; Zuccaro, A",NA,NA,NA,"Lahrmann, Urs; Zuccaro, Alga",NA,"<i>Opprimo ergo sum</i>-Evasion and Suppression in the Root Endophytic Fungus <i>Piriformospora indica</i>","MOLECULAR PLANT-MICROBE INTERACTIONS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zuccaro, Alga/Q-2450-2015","Zuccaro, Alga/0000-0002-8026-0114",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0894-0282","1943-7706",NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2012,"25","6",NA,NA,NA,"727","737",NA,"10.1094/MPMI-11-11-0291","http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-11-11-0291",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,22352718,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000303660300001",NA,"Absence","label_loose",0.678554834138832,0.321445165861168
26233,8728,NA,"There has been very little effort to incorporate foliar microbiomes into plant conservation efforts even though foliar endophytes are critically important to the fitness and function of hosts. Many critically endangered plants that have been extirpated from the wild are dependent on regular fungicidal applications in greenhouses that cannot be maintained for remote out-planted populations, which quickly perish. These fungicides negatively impact potentially beneficial fungal symbionts, which may reduce plant defenses to pathogens once fungicide treatments are stopped. Using the host/parasite system of Phyllostegia kaalaensis and Neoerysiphe galeopsidis, we conducted experiments to test total foliar microbiome transplants from healthy wild relatives onto fungicide-dependent endangered plants in an attempt to mitigate disease and reduce dependency on fungicides. Plants were treated with total microbiome transplants or cultured subsets of this community and monitored for disease severity. High-throughput DNA screening of fungal ITS1 rDNA was used to track the leaf-associated fungal communities and evaluate the effectiveness of transplantation methods. Individuals receiving traditionally isolated fungal treatments showed no improvement, but those receiving applications of a simple leaf slurry containing an uncultured fungal community showed significant disease reduction, to which we partially attribute an increase in the mycoparasitic Pseudozyma aphidis. These results were replicated in two independent experimental rounds. Treated plants have since been moved to a native habitat and, as of this writing, remain disease-free. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple low-tech method for transferring beneficial microbes from healthy wild plants to greenhouse-raised plants with reduced symbiotic microbiota. This technique was effective at reducing disease, and in conferring increased survival to an out-planted population of critically endangered plants. It was not effective in a closely related plant. Plant conservation efforts should strive to include foliar microbes as part of comprehensive management plans.","Zahn, G; Amend, AS",NA,NA,NA,"Zahn, Geoffrey; Amend, Anthony S.",NA,"Foliar microbiome transplants confer disease resistance in a critically-endangered plant","PEERJ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zahn, Geoffrey/R-7699-2019; Zahn, Geoffrey/JFJ-2722-2023","Zahn, Geoffrey/0000-0002-8691-692X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2167-8359",NA,NA,NA,NA,"NOV 10",2017,"5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.7717/peerj.4020","http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29134155,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000414927300002",NA,"Absence","label_loose",0.550914832577889,0.449085167422111

Ectomycorrhizae have not been confirmed for pteridophytes so far, and basidiomycetes are found very rarely in mycoheterotropic gametophytes. Fungal endophytes are unevenly distributed across the life forms and most frequent with 75 % in the terrestrial species, followed with 69 % in saxicolous and with 58 % in epiphytic species. Although AMF have a low dispersal potential and thus are considered unreliable symbiotic partners for epiphytes, they are still present in 27 % of the investigated epiphytic pteridophytes. The occurrence of mycorrhizae across the taxa of pteridophytes bears a phylogenetic signal, as the derived ferns show a notable trend towards a growing independence from AM, in epiphytes more pronouncedly so than in terrestrial taxa.","Lehnert, M; Krug, M; Kessler, M",NA,NA,NA,"Lehnert, Marcus; Krug, Michael; Kessler, Michael",NA,"A review of symbiotic fungal endophytes in lycophytes and ferns - a global phylogenetic and ecological perspective","SYMBIOSIS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kessler, Michael/A-3605-2009; Lehnert, Marcus/F-3288-2011","Kessler, Michael/0000-0003-4612-9937; Lehnert, Marcus/0000-0002-7202-7734",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0334-5114","1878-7665",NA,NA,NA,"FEB",2017,"71","2",NA,NA,NA,"77","89",NA,"10.1007/s13199-016-0436-5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-016-0436-5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000395022600001",NA,"Absence","label_loose",0.559553503173174,0.440446496826826
