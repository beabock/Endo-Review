7356,Detecting and differentiating Acremonium implicatum:: developing a PCR-based method for an endophytic fungus associated with the genus Brachiaria,"Brachiaria is a pan-tropical genus of grasses with about 100 species. The fungus Acremonium implicatum can develop an endophytic association that is mutually beneficial with Brachiaria species. We developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method by first amplifying DNA from A. implicatum isolates using the Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique with arbitrary 10-mer primers. A 500-bp PCR product, amplified with primer OPAK-10 and common to A. implicatum isolates, was selected for further evaluation. The fragment was digoxygenin-labelled and used to probe a dot blot containing genomic DNA from isolates of A. implicatum and non-endophytic fungi, and from Brachiaria species free of endophytes. Strong signals were obtained only for DNA from A. implicatum isolates. This fragment was cloned and subsequently sequenced. Based on the sequence data, two primers were selected and synthesized: P1 (5'-TTCGAATGATAAGGCAGATC-3') and P4 (5'-ACGCATCCACTGTATGCTAC-3'). The primer pair amplified a single fragment of about 500 bp from DNA of A. implicatum isolates, whether from pure culture or in association with Brachiaria plants. No amplification product was detected in DNA from endophyte-free plants, pathogenic fungi, the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. graminis, or non-pathogenic fungi associated with Brachiaria. This assay thus allows the precise and rapid detection of endophytes in Brachiaria, plants and permits a differentiation between endophytic and non-endophytic fungi.","Kelemu, S; Dongyi, H; Huang, GX; Takayama, Y",MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY,2003,10.1046/j.1364-3703.2003.00157.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.908008556807325,TRUE,8,10,Very High,endophyte-free; free of endophytes; no amplification,culture; pcr; amplified; sequenced; primers,"culture or in association with Brachiaria plants.

17979,Is the bacterial leaf nodule symbiosis obligate for Psychotria umbellata? The development of a Burkholderia-free host plant.,"The bacterial leaf nodule symbiosis is an interaction where bacteria are housed in specialised structures in the leaves of their plant host. In the Rubiaceae plant family, host plants interact with Burkholderia bacteria. This interaction might play a role in the host plant defence system. It is unique due to its high specificity; the vertical transmission of the endophyte to the next generation of the host plant; and its supposedly obligatory character. Although previous attempts have been made to investigate this obligatory character by developing Burkholderia-free plants, none have succeeded and nodulating plants were still produced. In order to investigate the obligatory character of this endosymbiosis, our aims were to develop Burkholderia-free Psychotria umbellata plants and to investigate the effect of the absence of the endophytes on the host in a controlled environment. The Burkholderia-free plants were obtained via embryo culture, a plant cultivation technique. In order to analyse the endophyte-free status, we screened the plants morphologically, microscopically and molecularly over a period of three years. To characterise the phenotype and growth of the in vitro aposymbiotic plants, we compared the growth of the Burkholderia-free plants to the nodulating plants under the same in vitro conditions. All the developed plants were Burkholderia-free and survived in a sterile in vitro environment. The growth analysis showed that plants without endophytes had a slower development. Embryo culture is a cultivation technique with a high success rate for the development of Burkholderia-free plants of P. umbellata. The increased growth rate in vitro when the specific endophyte is present cannot be explained by possible benefits put forward in previous studies.

Specifically, we tested if several different isolates of the fungus altered the growth and survival of the parasitoid, Microctonus hyperodae. Adult weevils were collected from paddocks near Lincoln, New Zealand and maintained in an environmental chamber. Weevils were assorted into treatment groups and fed perennial ryegrass (cv. Nui) lacking endophyte infection (nit) or containing one of the following endophyte strains: ARW, AR1, AR6, AR37. All endophyte strains differed from one another with respect to the profile of alkaloids they produce. Following two weeks of acclimation, weevils were placed with M. hyperodae to allow for parasitization. Weevils were then placed into Petri dishes (10 per dish) and fed grass clippings from the appropriate treatment group. We collected weevils as they died and dissected them to assess the development of parasitoids. Emergence of prepupae from hosts and survival to adulthood were also recorded. Fungal isolates did not differ in their influence on weevil feeding or survival. In contrast, the effect of the endophyte on the parasitoid varied among isolates of the fungus. Isolates ARW and AR6 reduced parasitoid adult emergence relative to nit endophyte. In contrast, AR37 had no negative effect on survival of the parasitoid. Furthermore, an index of developmental rate showed that parasitoids developed more slowly when reared from hosts fed grass containing any of the strains of N. lolii, except AR37, compared to endophyte-free grass.

958,Aploneura lentisci (Homoptera: Aphididae) and Its Interactions with Fungal Endophytes in Perennial Ryegrass (Lolium perenne),"Aploneura lentisci Pass. is endemic to the Mediterranean region where it is holocyclic, forming galls on its primary host, Pistacia lentiscus and alternating over a 2-year period between Pistacia and secondary hosts, principally species of Gramineae. This aphid is widely distributed in Australia and New Zealand on the roots of the common forage grasses, ryegrass (Lolium spp.) and tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix) where it exists as permanent, anholocyclic, parthenogenetic populations. Previous studies have indicated that infestations of A. lentisci significantly reduce plant growth and may account for differences in field performance of Lolium perenne infected with different strains of the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae var. lolii. These obligate biotrophs protect their host grasses from herbivory via the production of alkaloids. To confirm the hypothesis that growth of L. perenhe is associated with the effect of different endophyte strains on aphid populations, herbage and root growth were measured over time in two pot trials that compared three fungal endophyte strains with an endophyte-free control. In both pot trials, aphid numbers were lowest on plants infected with endophyte strain AR37 at all sampling times. In plants infected with a common toxic strain naturalized in New Zealand, aphid numbers overall were lower than on uninfected plants or those infected with strain AR1, but numbers did not always differ significantly from these treatments. Populations on AR1-infected plants were occasionally significantly higher than those on endophyte-free. Cumulative foliar growth was reduced in AR1 and Nil treatments relative to AR37 in association with population differences of A. lentisci in both trials and root dry weight was reduced in one trial. In four Petri dish experiments survival of A. lentisci on plants infected with AR37 declined to low levels after an initial phase of up to 19 days during which time aphids fed and populations were similar to those on plants without endophyte. Aphids on AR37-infected plants became uncoordinated in their movement and developed tremors before dying suggesting a neurotoxin was responsible for their mortality. Results support the hypothesis that differences in A. lentisci populations due to endophyte infection status and strain affects plant growth.","Popay, AJ; Cox, NR",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2016,10.3389/fpls.2016.01395,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997873566457789,TRUE,6,4,High,endophyte-free; without endophyte,petri; ITS,"measured over time in two pot trials that compared three fungal endophyte strains with an endophyte-free control.

2085,Fungal endophytes of a forage grass reduce faecal degradation rates,"Mutualisms between fungal endophytes and forage grasses can exert broad-reaching effects on grassland communities and ecosystem processes. We hypothesised that endophytes of grasses would retard the process of faecal degradation since grazing animals consume primarily live plant material and excrete a large portion of the herbage they consume as faeces. We examined the degradation rates of faeces from sheep that had consumed pure swards of perennial ryegrass containing a range of unique strains (AR1, AR37, or Wild type) of the fungal endophyte, Neotyphodium lolii, or no endophyte. Ultimately, the presence of endophytes in perennial ryegrass resulted in slower faecal decay rates compared to the nil endophyte treatment, although only consistently for the C concentration decay rates that were approximately 2x to 4x slower in the endophyte-derived faecal matter. The decay rate of dry matter content was significantly slower (ca. 1.5x) in the novel endophyte-derived faeces (AR1 and AR37) compared to the nil endophyte-derived faeces. The N decay rates differed significantly only in the AR1 treatment that was approximately 4x slower than the nil endophyte group. The reduced decay rates are attributed to the presence of endophyte-derived alkaloids in the faeces, and a greater proportion of more easily degraded hemicellulose in faeces from sheep that consumed the endophyte-free grass. There were no significant differences in the faecal carbon and nitrogen decay rates among the three endophyte strain treatments. This suggests that all the strain-specific alkaloids might have similar effects, or that N. lolii has a general effect that is not strain-specific, such as altered fibre composition, as reported here. This is the first report of a fungal endophyte affecting the rate of faecal degradation, and the first report of the alkaloids peramine, lolitrem B and epoxy-janthitrems in faecal matter. This study shows that a common agronomic grass-endophyte mutualism can have effects on ecosystem processes that have not previously been considered.","Cripps, MG; Edwards, GR",BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,2013,10.1016/j.baae.2012.12.004,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.890327686779136,TRUE,6,3,High,no endophyte; endophyte-free,examined; examined,a greater proportion of more easily degraded hemicellulose in faeces from sheep that consumed the endophyte-free grass.

8970,Pervasive effects of a dominant foliar endophytic fungus on host genetic and phenotypic expression in a tropical tree,"It is increasingly recognized that macro-organisms (corals, insects, plants, vertebrates) consist of both host tissues and multiple microbial symbionts that play essential roles in their host's ecological and evolutionary success. Consequently, identifying benefits and costs of symbioses, as well as mechanisms underlying them are research priorities. All plants surveyed under natural conditions harbor foliar endophytic fungi (FEE) in their leaf tissues, often at high densities. Despite producing no visible effects on their hosts, experiments have nonetheless shown that FEE reduce pathogen and herbivore damage. Here, combining results from three genomic, and two physiological experiments, we demonstrate pervasive genetic and phenotypic effects of the apparently asymptomatic endophytes on their hosts. Specifically, inoculation of endophyte-free (E) Theobroma cacao leaves with Colletotrichum tropicale (E+), the dominant FEE species in healthy T cacao, induces consistent changes in the expression of hundreds of host genes, including many with known defensive functions. Further, E+ plants exhibited increased lignin and cellulose content, reduced maximum rates of photosynthesis (A(max)), and enrichment of nitrogen-15 and carbon-13 isotopes. These phenotypic changes observed in E+ plants correspond to changes in expression of specific functional genes in related pathways. Moreover, a cacao gene (Tc00g04254) highly up-regulated by C. tropicale also confers resistance to pathogen damage in the absence of endophytes or their products in host tissues. Thus, the benefits of increased pathogen resistance in E+ plants are derived in part from up-regulation of intrinsic host defense responses, and appear to be offset by potential costs including reduced photosynthesis, altered host nitrogen metabolism, and endophyte heterotrophy of host tissues. Similar effects are likely in most plant-endophyte interactions, and should be recognized in the design and interpretation of genetic and phenotypic studies of plants.","Mejía, LC; Herre, EA; Sparks, JP; Winter, K; García, MN; Van Bael, SA; Stitt, J; Zhang, Y; Zhang, YF; Guiltinan, MJ; Maximova, SN",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2014,10.3389/fmicb.2014.00479,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.558063507971598,TRUE,6,3,High,endophyte-free; absence of endophytes,observed; surveyed,"genetic and phenotypic effects of the apparently asymptomatic endophytes on their hosts.

Because infection results in changes in phenotypic means for numerous traits, changes in phenotypic variances could also be a result of infection. Phenotypic variances for forage and seed production were investigated in studies of polycross families from endophyte-infected (EI) and endophyte-free (EF) clones of 20 tall fescue genotypes. No significant phenotypic variance for forage production was detected among EI families during the study. In 1989, phenotypic variances for EF were greater than EI for both harvests, suggesting that the endophyte can mask plant genotypic variance. Significant phenotypic variances were observed for all seed production traits in both EI and EF. Phenotypic variances for total seed weight and seed numbers in 1990 were greater for EI than for EF. Estimates of genetic variance for these traits were not greater than twice the standard error in the EF state but were greater than twice the standard error in the EI state. The resulting heritability estimates reflected this difference. Endophyte presence could result in overestimates of plant genotypic variance for these traits.

1220,Plant nitrogen acquisition and interactions under elevated carbon dioxide: impact of endophytes and mycorrhizae,"Both endophytic and mycorrhizal fungi interact with plants to form symbiosis in which the fungal partners rely on, and sometimes compete for, carbon (C) sources from their hosts. Changes in photosynthesis in host plants caused by atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment may, therefore, influence those mutualistic interactions, potentially modifying plant nutrient acquisition and interactions with other coexisting plant species. However, few studies have so far examined the interactive controls of endophytes and mycorrhizae over plant responses to atmospheric CO2 enrichment. Using Festuca arundinacea Schreb and Plantago lanceolata L. as model plants, we examined the effects of elevated CO2 on mycorrhizae and endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum) and plant nitrogen (N) acquisition in two microcosm experiments, and determined whether and how mycorrhizae and endophytes mediate interactions between their host plant species. Endophyte-free and endophyte-infected F. arundinacea varieties, P. lanceolata L., and their combination with or without mycorrhizal inocula were grown under ambient (400 mu mol mol(-1)) and elevated CO2 (ambient + 330 mu mol mol(-1)). A N-15 isotope tracer was used to quantify the mycorrhiza-mediated plant acquisition of N from soil. Elevated CO2 stimulated the growth of P. lanceolata greater than F. arundinacea, increasing the shoot biomass ratio of P. lanceolata to F. arundinacea in all the mixtures. Elevated CO2 also increased mycorrhizal root colonization of P. lanceolata, but had no impact on that of F. arundinacea. Mycorrhizae increased the shoot biomass ratio of P. lanceolata to F. arundinacea under elevated CO2. In the absence of endophytes, both elevated CO2 and mycorrhizae enhanced N-15 and total N uptake of P. lanceolata but had either no or even negative effects on N acquisition of F. arundinacea, altering N distribution between these two species in the mixture. The presence of endophytes in F. arundinacea, however, reduced the CO2 effect on N acquisition in P. lanceolata, although it did not affect growth responses of their host plants to elevated CO2. These results suggest that mycorrhizal fungi and endophytes might interactively affect the responses of their host plants and their coexisting species to elevated CO2.","Chen, X; Tu, C; Burton, MG; Watson, DM; Burkey, KO; Hu, SJ",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,2007,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01347.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.96978177045877,TRUE,6,3,High,endophyte-free; absence of endophytes,examined; examined,"and determined whether and how mycorrhizae and endophytes mediate interactions between their host plant species.

2595,Occurrence and impact of pasture mealybug (Balanococcus poae) and root aphid (Aploneura lentisci) on ryegrass (Lolium spp.) with and without infection by Neotyphodium fungal endophytes,"Pasture mealybug (Balanococcus poae) was found infesting two field trials evaluating the performance of selected strains of the endophyte Neotyphodium lolii in ryegrass (Lolium spp.) in Canterbury, New Zealand. Deterioration of endophyte-free plots relative to endophyte-infected plots had been observed. In Trial A, pasture mealybug were sampled in plots of the perennial ryegrass cultivar 'Grasslands Nui', without endophyte (nil), or infected with the wild-type endophyte, or the selected strains, AR1 and AR37. In Trial B, mealybug numbers on six ryegrass cultivars infected with AR1 or wild-type were compared with those on the same cultivars without endophyte. In sampling these trials, the presence of a root aphid, Aploneura lentisci, was also noted. Populations of mealybug in both trials were similar on all endophyte-infected treatments and significantly lower than populations on nil treatments. Neither AR1 nor wild-type appeared to reduce root aphid numbers, while AR37 may have had some effect. The amount of dead grass was significantly greater in nil than in endophyte-infected plots in Trial A, and yield of ryegrass was correlated with numbers of mealybug and root aphid present. Pasture productivity in nil treatments had recovered by spring, in the year of the outbreak. The presence of endophyte, strain of endophyte and cultivar were all significant factors affecting both total dry matter and green yield in Trial B. Pasture mealybug accounted for 55% of the variation in a decline in growth rate that occurred in this trial over the summer-autumn periods between 2000 and 200 1, particularly in the nil treatments. Two years after the outbreak there was 25% less ryegrass and persistently lower pasture yields in nil plots. We conclude that pasture mealybug are capable of inflicting severe damage to endophyte-free ryegrass in Canterbury, particularly during dry summer-autumn periods.","Pennell, CGL; Popay, AJ; Ball, OJP; Hume, DE; Baird, DB",NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,2005,10.1080/00288233.2005.9513663,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985968366611449,TRUE,6,3,High,endophyte-free; without endophyte,observed; sampled,"of the endophyte Neotyphodium lolii in ryegrass (Lolium spp.) in Canterbury, New Zealand.

19947,"Turfgrass species and endophyte effects on survival, development, and feeding preference of black cutworms (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)","Growth, developmental rate, and survival of black cutworms, Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel), were compared on cool-season turfgrasses used commonly on golf courses, including cultivars with or without Neotyphodium spp. (=Acremonium spp.) endophytes. We also studied feeding preferences of neonates and 5th instars, including possible effects of induction of preference, to clarify patterns of movement of larvae between creeping bentgrass, Agrostis palustris Hudson, putting greens and peripheral areas. Development of black cutworms on 3 diverse cultivars of Kentucky bluegrass, Poa pratensis L., was much poorer than on all other turfgrasses tested. Most larvae that fed on Kentucky bluegrass did not survive to pupation. In contrast, endophyte-free 'Assure' perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne L., and 'SR8300' tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea Schreber, were generally as suitable for cutworms as creeping bentgrass, the standard grass used on putting greens. Larvae reared on endophyte-infected SR8300 tall fescue showed no adverse effects; those fed endophyte-infected Assure perennial ryegrass showed only small reductions in growth rate compared with larvae reared on the same cultivar without endophyte. In laboratory choice tests, 1-d-old larvae consistently preferred creeping bentgrass over Kentucky bluegrass or tall fescue, regardless of which grass they had fed upon during the preceding 24 h. There was evidence for induction of preference for perennial ryegrass over creeping bentgrass in 1 of 2 trials. Preferences of 5th instars were more variable, but creeping bentgrass was preferred consistently over Kentucky bluegrass. In paired field plots, 5th instars did not discriminate between creeping bentgrass and perennial ryegrass, but preferred both of those species over Kentucky bluegrass. These results indicate that black cutworm densities could build up in areas of tall fescue or perennial ryegrass surrounding golf course putting greens and tees, and that endophyte infection of those grasses will not necessarily provide resistance. Use of Kentucky bluegrass in higher-mowed, peripheral areas may reduce numbers of black cutworms developing in roughs and fairways and later crawling onto putting greens.","Williamson, RC; Potter, DA",JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY,1997,NA,Absence,Absence,Absence,0.968057578700106,TRUE,6,2,Medium,endophyte-free; without endophyte,studied; tested,"tested.

2396,Tall fescue aluminum tolerance is affected by Neotyphodium coenophialum endophyte,"Roots of endophyte-infected (E+) tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) exude more phenolic-like reductants than roots of endophyte-free (E-) plants when mineral stressed. Phenolic compounds are efficient chelators of aluminum (Al) and may influence Al tolerance in many plant species. The objective of our study was to determine if enhanced release of phenolic compounds by roots of E+ plants contributes to Al tolerance in tall fescue. Two cloned genotypes (DN2 and DN11) of tall fescue infected with their naturally occurring fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum (Morgan-Jones and Gams) Glenn, Bacon and Hanlin and their noninfected isolines were grown in nutrient solutions at 0 mu M Al(Al-) and at 640 mu M Al (Al+) under controlled environment conditions. Root and shoot dry matter (DM) of endophyte-infected tall fescue was greater in E+ than E- plants by 57% and 40%, respectively, when plants were grown without Al. Endophyte infection did not affect root and shoot DM of tall fescue grown with Al but relative (to Al-treatment) reduction in root and shoot DM was greater in E+ than E- plants. In response to Al stress, more Al (47%) and P (49%) could be desorbed from root surfaces of E+ than E- plants. Aluminum concentrations in roots of E+ plants were 35% greater and P concentrations were 10% less than those determined in roots of E- plants. No differences in mineral concentrations were observed in shoots, regardless of endophyte status, or Al level in nutrient solution. Roots of E+ plants increased pH of both Al- and Al+ nutrient solutions to a greater extent than roots of E- plants in a 48 h interval. Our results show that more Al can be sequestered on root surfaces and in root tissues of endophyte-infected tall fescue than in plants devoid of endophyte. Aluminum sequestration was greater on root surfaces and in root tissues of E+ than E- plants of a given tall fescue genotype. Our results suggest that increased exudation of phenolic-like compounds from roots of endophyte-infected tall fescue may be directly involved in Al tolerance and serves as a mechanism for widespread adaptability and success of endophyte-tall fescue associations.","Malinowski, DP; Belesky, DP",JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION,1999,10.1080/01904169909365716,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.943624097566862,TRUE,6,2,Medium,endophyte-free; devoid of endophyte,observed,of endophyte-infected (E+) tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) exude more phenolic-like reductants than roots of endophyte-free (E-) plants when mineral stressed.

3779,The effect of endophyte on the performance of irrigated perennial ryegrasses in subtropical Australia,"The effect of fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium lolii) infection on the performance of perennial ryegrass ( Lolium perenne) growing under irrigation in a subtropical environment was investigated. Seed of 4 cultivars, infected with standard ( common toxic or wild-type) endophyte or the novel endophyte AR1, or free of endophyte ( Nil), was sown in pure swards, which were fertilised with 50 kg N/ha. month. Seasonal and total yield, persistence, and rust susceptibility were assessed over 3 years, along with details of the presence of endophyte and alkaloids in plant shoots. Endophyte occurrence in tillers in both the standard and AR1 treatments was above 95% for Bronsyn and Impact throughout and rose to that level in Samson by the end of the second year. Meridian AR1 only reached 93% while, in the standard treatment, the endophyte had mostly died before sowing. Nil endophyte treatments carried an average of similar to 0.6% infection throughout. Infection of the standard endophyte was associated with increased dry matter (DM) yields in all 3 years compared with no endophyte. AR1 also significantly increased yields in the second and third years. Over the full 3 years, standard and AR1 increased yields by 18% and 11%, respectively. Infection with both endophytes was associated with increased yields in all 4 seasons, the effects increasing in intensity over time. There was 27% better persistence in standard infected plants compared with Nil at the end of the first year, increasing to 198% by the end of the experiment, while for AR1 the improvements were 20 and 134%, respectively. The effect of endophyte on crown rust (Puccinia coronata) infection was inconsistent, with endophyte increasing rust damage on one occasion and reducing it on another. Cultivar differences in rust infection were greater than endophyte effects. Plants infected with the AR1 endophyte had no detectable ergovaline or lolitrem B in leaf, pseudostem, or dead tissue. In standard infected plants, ergovaline and lolitrem B were highest in pseudostem and considerably lower in leaf. Dead tissue had very low or no detectable ergovaline but high lolitrem B concentrations. Peramine concentration was high and at similar levels in leaf and pseudostem, but not detectable in dead material. Concentration was similar in both AR1 and standard infected plants. Endophyte presence appeared to have a similar effect in the subtropics as has been demonstrated in temperate areas, in terms of improving yields and persistence and increasing tolerance of plants to stress factors.","Lowe, KF; Bowdler, TM; Hume, DE; Casey, ND; Tapper, BA",AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,2008,10.1071/AR08019,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.966514555187486,TRUE,6,2,Medium,no endophyte; free of endophyte,investigated; assessed,"infected with standard ( common toxic or wild-type) endophyte or the novel endophyte AR1, or free of endophyte ( Nil), was sown in pure swards, which were fertilised with 50 kg N/ha. month.","fertilised with 50 kg N/ha. month.

Six, endophyte-infected (EI) genotypes varying in ability to produce rhizomes and their endophyte-free (EF) clones were compared in a split-split plot design with plant age (about 3, 6, 9, and 12 mo after transplanting) as main plots, genotypes as subplots, and infection status as sub-subplots. The experiment was planted twice and rhizomes counted on each treatment in the field at the time of digging and after washing. Number of rhizomes was highest 1 yr after transplanting. More rhizomes were counted on washed than field-counted plants, but correlations between the two were high (r = 0.95), indicating that either would accurately rank genotypes. There was no endophyte effect on number of rhizomes, but a significant genotype x infection status interaction was found in March.

2071,"Grazing influences on mass, nutritive value, and persistence of stockpiled Jesup tall fescue without and with novel and wild-type fungal endophytes","Introducing novel endophytes into tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) that produce no ergot alkaloids could prevent negative impacts on animal performance while improving plant persistence. This 3-yr study evaluated 'Jesup' tall fescue (TF) for forage mass, nutritive value, and stand persistence when containing no endophyte, a novel endophyte (no ergot alkaloids), or a wild-type endophyte (ergot alkaloids). Forage was accumulated from mid-August and treatments consisted of (i) a grazed control (grazed when growth approximated 10 to 15 cm), or forage accumulated and grazed in (ii) mid-November, (iii) mid-December, (iv) mid-January, and (v) mid-February. Endophyte status had no influence on total forage mass; forage removed by grazing; proportion of leaf, stem, and dead fractions; or on nutritive value (except ergovaline which was greatest in the wild type). Delaying defoliation linearly reduced forage mass, ergovaline concentration, and nutritive value. All stands of TF declined with losses similar (P = 0.37) for wild-type and novel stands (29 vs. 42%) but were greatest for the TF without an endophyte (29 vs. 75%; P = 0.01 and 42 vs. 75%; P = 0.04). These data support the use of novel endophytes in TF for animal production and caution against the use of endophyte-free TF because of decreased stand longevity.

1442,Impact of Epichloe endophytes on adult Argentine stem weevil damage to perennial ryegrass seedlings,"In New Zealand, the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae var. lolii Latch, Christensen & Samuels (Hypocreales) is widely used to enhance productivity and survival of mature perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne L. (Poaceae) plants. These endophytes produce alkaloids that reduce damage by insect pests, such as Argentine stem weevil (ASW), Listronotus bonariensis (Kuschel) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). However, knowledge of the effect of these fungi on seedlings is limited. High concentrations of grass-endophyte-derived alkaloids occur in endophyte-infected seed and can be translocated into seedlings to provide early protection from insect herbivory. A glasshouse experiment was conducted in which adult ASW were given a choice between perennial ryegrass cultivar 'One50' without endophyte (Nil) or containing endophyte strains AR1, AR37, or NZ(CT), and cv. 'Trojan' containing strain NEA2, in three post-sowing time periods. ASW feeding damage was assessed together with plant survival and dry weight production. Plant survival and dry matter production was reduced in all treatments with mortality highest in endophyte-free and AR37 treatments, especially in the first and second time period. Strongest adult ASW deterrence occurred on seedlings infected with endophyte strains that produce peramine (AR1, NZ(CT), and NEA2). Strain NZ(CT) was virtually undamaged in the third time period whereas damage initially increased in AR1 and NEA2 up until day 50-53 post-sowing and then declined. Endophyte-free and AR37 treatments were significantly more damaged than AR1, NZ(CT), and NEA2.

3500,Taxonomic placement of Epichloe poae sp nov and horizontal dissemination to seedlings via conidia,"A new Epichloe species distributed in Africa, Europe, North America and South America on host genera Bromus, Festuca, Lolium and Poa is described. Stromata, characteristic of the genus, frequently occurred on the reproductive tillers of Poa secunda subsp. juncifolia, but neither perithecia nor mature asci were observed. Conidiogenous cells and conidial characteristics were in the range of Epichloe typhina. Regions of the genes encoding beta-tubulin (tub2) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) were amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences grouped the Poa secunda subsp. juncifolia endophyte into one group within a non-hybrid Epichlo (e) over bar species complex. On the basis of morphology, host range and evolutionary history we propose that this endophyte represents a new species of Epichloe. The name Epichloe poae is proposed for this endophyte. The infectivity of the conidia produced on plants was evaluated. In the first experiment, using conidia of Epichlo (e) over bar poae from leaves and endophyte-free seeds of Poa secunda subsp. juncifolia we show that when germinating seeds and developing seedlings of the plant were exposed to conidia, 28-57% of seedlings became infected by the endophyte. The non-inoculated control plants showed no colonization by the endophyte. In the following spring after vernalization, colonized plants on flowering culms produced stromata with conidia. In the second experiment, using stromal conidia and the same procedure, 19-42% of seedlings of Poa secunda subsp. juncifolia became colonized by the endophyte.

Microscopical examination of seed and leaf tissues revealed the presence of an endophytic fungus that did not produce spores when grown in culture and which was serologically related to endophytic Acremonium species of the Albo-lanosa section Morgan-Jones & Gams. ELISA indicated the presence of high concentrations of ergot alkaloids. Ergonovine and lysergic acid amide were identified by HPLC-at levels up to 2500 and 400 mg kg(-1), respectively-as the major ergot alkaloids by their retention times and their UV and fluorescence scans. Their identities were confirmed by HPLC analysis of epimerized extracts, and the identity of ergonovine was further confirmed by high-resolution FAB-MS and HPLC-FAB-MS. These are the highest levels of ergonovine and lysergic acid amide so far reported in an endophyte-infected grass, and the similarity of many of the symptoms of A. inebrians intoxication to those previously reported for ergonovine and lysergic acid amide implicates these alkaloids as causative agents of the toxicosis.

788,The negative effect of a vertically-transmitted fungal endophyte on seed longevity is stronger than that of ozone transgenerational effect,"The transition from mother plant seed production to seedlings recruitment is critical for annual plant species but also for vertically transmitted microbial symbionts. Evidence indicates that microbial symbionts play important roles in plant response to environmental changes. However, their role in plant facing gaseous tropospheric pollutants such as the highly reactive and phytotoxic ozone, have been scarcely studied. Here, we experimentally tested the consequences of maternal plant exposure to ozone on the longevity of Lohum mutiflontm seeds mediated by a vertically-transmitted fungal endophyte (Epichloe occultans). Seeds were produced by mother plants exposed to contrasting levels of ozone (low and high concentrations) in two phases of the life cycle (vegetative and reproductive). We first characterized the consequences of plant exposure to ozone on the state of the antioxidant glutathione in the seeds. Then, we examined viability dynamics of the seeds through an accelerated ageing trial and followed the physiological variables seed water content (SWC) and electrical conductivity (EC). Irrespectively of maternal ozone, seeds produced by endophyte-symbiotic plants presented higher contents of the oxidised form of glutathione. In the same direction, the fungal endophyte presence was associated with a dramatic reduction in seed longevity. The SWC was higher in endophyte-symbiotic seeds that in endophyte-free seeds. As time under accelerated ageing condition advanced, EC increased more in endophytesymbiotic seeds than in endophyte-free seeds.

2592,Contrasting infection frequencies of Neotyphodium endophyte in naturalized Italian ryegrass populations in Japanese farmlands,"Neotyphodium endophytes often confer benefits to their host grasses and may enhance invasiveness of some grasses. The knowledge of infection frequencies of endophytes among invading weed populations is necessary to understand the relationships between endophyte infection and invasiveness. Here we present data on infection frequencies of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), an important weed in some farmlands in Japan, persisting in contrasting farmlands: a terraced paddy field and a wheat-soybean double-cropped field in the western region of Shizuoka prefecture, Japan. The terraced paddy site is a mosaic of several landscape elements such as paddy fields, levees, fallow and abandoned fields, with a high percentage of non-crop area. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) has been cultivated for more than a decade with no application of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and fungicides. The wheat-soybean field is characterized by the aggregation of large-scaled fields that were originally reconstructed paddy fields, showing a low percentage of non-crop area. Wheat and soybean have been grown as winter and summer crops, respectively, using chemical fertilizers and herbicides. We examined the presence or absence of endophytes in a total of 1200 seeds sampled from the two Italian ryegrass populations. The terraced paddy population exhibited a markedly high infection frequency (91.0%), due possibly to selective feeding of non-infected seeds by insects. In contrast, the wheat-soybean farmland population showed almost no infection (1.1%), whereas the putative source of the invasion in the proximity exhibited a relatively high infection rate (64.4%). Such a micro-scale variation in infection frequencies may be attributable to a loss in endophyte viability within the wheat-soybean field. The findings suggest that endophyte infection frequency may markedly differ among the Italian ryegrass populations even within the same region, presumably depending on the abundance of the seed-eating insects, farmland management regimes and/or environmental conditions such as soil humidity.","Yamashita, M; Iwamoto, M; Maruyama, K; Ichihara, M; Sawada, H",GRASSLAND SCIENCE,2010,10.1111/j.1744-697X.2010.00177.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.989709144072836,TRUE,5,4,Medium,absence of endophytes; no infection,examined; examined; sampled,"winter and summer crops, respectively, using chemical fertilizers and herbicides.

14721,Vasoconstrictive responses of the testicular and caudal arteries in bulls exposed to ergot alkaloids from tall fescue,"Color Doppler ultrasonography was used to evaluate vasoconstrictive responses of the testicular artery in yearling bulls to ergot alkaloids (Neotyphodium coenophialum) produced by a fungal endophyte that infects tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh.]. Alkaloid-induced constriction of the testicular artery could disrupt thermoregulation. Luminal areas of the testicular artery were monitored and analyzed for 2 experiments that were designed to evaluate fertility responses of bulls to toxic endophyte-infected tall fescue. Experiment 1 (pen experiment) compared diets containing toxic endophyte-infected or endophyte-free tall fescue seed, and Exp. 2 (grazing experiment) compared grazing diets consisting of toxic endophyteinfected and nontoxic endophyte-infected tall-fescue pasture. In Exp. 1 ultrasound images were acquired on 3 dates during the 126-d of feeding and in Exp. 2 on 4 dates during the 155-d of grazing. Luminal area of the caudal artery also was monitored as an indicator of alkaloidinduced vasoconstriction. Caudal and testicular arteries for the toxic treatment responded similarly between experiments. Across imaging dates for Exp. 1, caudal artery lumens for the toxic diet averaged 42% less (P < 0.01) area than the nontoxic diet, and testicular arteries for the toxic diet averaged 40% less (P < 0.05) area than the nontoxic diet. For Exp. 2, there were interactions (P < 0.05) between treatment and imaging date on luminal areas of both arteries. Differences between treatments were not detected until the last 2 image dates, with luminal areas of caudal and testicular arteries on the last date for the toxic tall fescue being 46 and 41%, respectively, less than the nontoxic counterpart.

17193,First Report of Penicillium crustosum Causing Blue Mold on Stored Apple Fruit in Serbia.,"Penicillium crustosum Thom (1930) causes blue mold on pome fruits and is also regularly found on cheese, nuts, and soil (1,3). The fungus produces a wide range of mycotoxins such as penitrem A, roquefortine C, terrestric acid, and cyclopenol, which impact human health (1). In January and February 2013, 20 decayed apples, 'Golden Delicious' and 'Jonagold' (Malus × domestica Borkh.) with blue mold symptoms were collected from cold storages in Svilajnac and Bela Crkva, Serbia. Decayed areas were light to medium brown with blue green sporulation on the surface of the lesion. Decayed tissue was soft and watery with a sharp margin between the diseased and healthy areas. One isolate from each cultivar was designated JP2 ('Golden Delicious') and JBC7 ('Jonagold') and further characterized. Conidiophores of both isolates were terverticillate, stipes were septate with rough walls, and phialides were ampulliform. Conidia were smooth, borne in columns, and were spherical to subglobose. Conidial dimensions for JP2 were 3.2 to 4.56 (3.73) × 2.64 to 4.3 (3.32) μm and for JBC7 were 3.1 to 4.46 (3.65) × 2.81 to 4.27 (3.31) μm (n = 50). The isolates were cultured on Czapek yeast autolysate agar (CYA), malt extract agar (MEA), and yeast extract sucrose agar (YES) media and incubated at 25°C for 7 days. Mycelia were white with heavy sporulation yielding grayish green colonies on all media. Colonies were radially sulcate and velutinous, with clear exudate, and produced a yellow to orange reverse on CYA and YES. On MEA, colonies were plane, low, and mycelia subsurface with conidia having a dry powdery appearance. Crusts of conidial masses formed after 10 or more days. No growth was observed on CYA when these isolates were incubated at 37°C. Both isolates were identified as P. crustosum Thom using morphological characters according to (2) and (1). Species level identification was confirmed by isolating genomic DNA followed by amplification of the β-tubulin locus using gene specific primers via conventional PCR (4). MegaBLAST analysis of the 2X consensus nucleotide sequences revealed that JP2 and JBC7 (GenBank KJ433984 and 85) were 99% identical to P. crustosum culture collection isolate IBT 21518 (JN112030.1). Koch's postulates were examined using two apple cvs. Idared and Kolacara. Ten fruit per cultivar per isolate were inoculated on two sides of each fruit; 20 fruit were used as water-only inoculated controls. Fruit were washed with soap and water, surface sanitized with 70% ethanol, and placed into polyethylene boxes. Using a finishing nail, 4-mm wounds were created and inoculated with 50 μl of a 3 × 105/ml conidial suspension or Tween-treated sterile distilled water. Boxes with inoculated and control fruit were stored at 25°C for 10 days. The inoculated fruit developed small, soft, watery lesions, which enlarged into decayed areas with defined edges and abundant sporulation on the surface. Symptoms were identical to the original ones, while the control fruit remained symptomless. The fungus was re-isolated from infected tissue and showed the same morphological characteristics as the original isolates, thus completing Koch's postulates. Blue mold occurs during long term storage of apples and is predominantly caused by P. expansum. This is the first report of P. crustosum causing postharvest blue mold decay on apple fruit obtained from storage in Serbia and indicates that P. crustosum is an emerging pathogen for the Serbian pome fruit growing and packing industry.

17194,First Report of Penicillium polonicum Causing Blue Mold on Stored Onion (Allium cepa) in Serbia.,"Penicillium polonicum K. Zaleski is an economically important airborne fungus with a broad host range including cereals, peanuts, onions, dried meats, citrus fruits, and yam tubers (2,4). Secondary metabolites produced by this species include harmful mycotoxins penicillic acid, verucosidin, and nephrotoxic glycopeptides, which may play a role in Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (2,5). In January 2013, decayed onion bulbs (Allium cepa L. cv. Meranto) with blue mold symptoms were found causing significant economic losses at a storage facility in Stara Pazova, Serbia, and were collected. The decayed area of the bulbs was pale yellow to light brown, and tissue was soft and watery. Bluish green sporulation was abundant on the surface and inside the bulb, between decayed scales. Two isolates (designated L1a and L4p) were obtained and further characterized using morphological and molecular methods. Colonies on potato dextrose agar (PDA), Czapek yeast autolysate agar (CYA), malt extract agar (MEA), and yeast extract sucrose agar (YES) media at 25°C after 7 days were blue green, velutinous, with clear exudate present on CYA. Colony reverse color on CYA and YES for both isolates were cream to yellow brown. The mean colony diameter on PDA for L1a was 29.89 ± 0.96 mm, and for L4p was 26 ± 0.37 mm; on CYA 32.56 ± 0.53 mm for L1a and 30.11 ± 2.42 mm for L4p; and on YES 33.86 ± 1.59 mm for L1a and 31.17 ± 1.83 mm for L4p. No growth was observed on CYA when isolates were incubated at 37°C. Conidiophores of both isolates were terverticillate, stipes were septate with smooth to finely roughened walls, and phialides were ampulliform. Conidia were globose to subglobose, smooth-walled, and borne in columns. Conidial dimensions for L4p were 2.72 to 3.82 (3.26) × 2.36 to 3.42 (2.95) μm, and for L1a were 2.87 to 4.39 (3.58) × 2.53 to 3.79 (3.16) μm (n = 50). Both isolates tested positive for the production of cyclopiazonic acid and other alkaloids, as indicated by a violet reaction for the Ehrlich test. Morphological characters of L1a and L4p were in accordance with those described for P. polonicum K. Zaleski (2). Genomic DNA was isolated using CTAB extraction method (1) and molecular identification was completed using gene specific primers for the β-tubulin locus (Bt-LEV-Up4/Bt-LEV-Lo1) via conventional PCR (3). The nucleotide sequences of amplified products (~800 bp) have been assigned to GenBank (KJ570971 and 72). MegaBLAST of obtained sequences showed a 99% similarity with several sequences of P. polonicum deposited in GenBank, which confirmed the morphological identification. Pathogenicity was tested by wound inoculation of 10 surface sanitized onion bulbs cv. Meranto with 50 μl of a 105/ml conidial suspension from isolates grown on PDA. Ten control onion bulbs were wound-inoculated with Tween-treated sterile distilled water. After 30 days incubation in plastic containers, under high humidity at 22°C, typical symptoms of blue mold developed on inoculated bulbs, while non-inoculated controls remained symptomless. Isolates recovered from inoculated bulbs showed the same morphological characteristics as the original isolates, thus completing Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. polonicum on stored onion in Serbia. Results from this study indicate that a holistic approach to control this fungus should be implemented that may include one or all of the following: increased sanitation methods to eliminate inoculum, breeding for resistant onion cultivars, and integration of additional control methods to maintain onion quality during storage.

17213,First Report of Ceratocystis fimbriata-Caused Wilt of Eriobotrya japonica in China.,"The loquat (Eriobotrya japonica (Thunb.) Lindl.), an important perennial evergreen fruit crop that originated in China and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant, is well known all over the world for high nutritional, medicinal, economic, and ecological values (4). So far, it has been grown in more than 30 countries (1) and is becoming an important industry in China, Spain, Japan, India, Pakistan, and Turkey (2). During an investigation from May to August of 2013, severely withered loquat plants were observed in Kunming city of Yunnan Province (25°02' N; 102°42' E), Southwest China. Initial symptoms were brown lesions of leaves and canker on one to several branches, leaves of the whole tree turned wilted. Cross sections of diseased plants revealed irregularly shaped brown discoloration in the xylem of the trunk. A fungus was consistently isolated from the leaf when diseased leaves were incubated between two slices of fresh carrot root. Spore masses were picked from the apices of perithecia and transferred to malt extract agar medium (MEA) and incubated at 25°C. After perithecium formation, observed perithecia were black, globose (176.0 to 303.2 × 186.0 to 274.3 μm) and showed a long black neck (634.2 to 809.9 μm). Ascospore had the typical format of a ""hat"" with dimensions of 4.6 to 6.3 × 3.3 to 4.8 μm. Cylindrical endoconidia (7.1 to 36.1 × 2.9 to 6.0 μm) were found. Chlamydospores were ovoid or obpyriform and smooth (8.6 to 12.1 × 6.9 to 12.1 μm). PCR amplification was carried out for one isolate, YT2. The ITS region of rDNA was sequenced using the procedures of Thorpe et al (3). Analysis of ITS sequence data (GenBank Accession Nos. KF963101 and KF963102) showed that the isolates were 99% homologous to the isolate of Ceratocystis fimbriata from diseased Colocasia esculenta in Cuba, China, and Hawaii (AY526304 to 06) by BLAST analysis. Therefore, the fungus was identified as C. fimbriata based on morphological and molecular characteristics. Pathogenicity of the six isolates from this study was tested by inoculation of 1-year-old pot grown seedlings of loquat. The soil of six plants was inoculated by drenching with 40 ml spore suspension (106 spores/ml). Control plants were inoculated with 40 ml of sterile distilled water. The plants were maintained in a controlled greenhouse at 25°C and watered weekly. After inoculation for 1 week, all plants produced wilt symptoms; as the disease progressed, leaves withered and died after 3 weeks of inoculation while control plants remained symptomless. C. fimbriata was successfully re-isolated from the infected trees and no fungal growth was observed in the controls. The pathogenicity assay showed that C. fimbriata was pathogenic to loquat. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. fimbriata causing wilt of loquat in China. Since C. fimbriata is one of the most aggressive plant pathogens on a wide variety of perennial as well as agronomic crop plants worldwide, and the infection can pose a significant threat to the production of loquat, it is critical to deploy appropriate management strategies to limit the fungus spread.

16623,First Report of Bacterial Leaf Spot Caused by Pseudomonas cichorii on Phlox paniculata in Italy.,"Phlox paniculata L. (fall phlox) is a perennial garden species belonging to the Polemoniaceae family. During the spring of 2003 and 2004, leaf spot symptoms were observed on fall phlox plants in some private gardens in the Biella area (northern Italy). Lesions were first observed on leaves at the collar level and later on the entire plant. Lesions started as water-soaked areas, which in few days developed on the upper side of the leaves into irregular, shrunken, reddish brown spots from 1 to 2 mm in diameter. Lesions on the lower surface sometimes had a translucent halo. In many cases, the leaves were completely withered. Disease was particularly severe during the spring and fall and its incidence ranged from 10 to 25%. No fungal structures were observed within the lesions. Small fragments of tissue from affected leaves were macerated in nutrient yeast dextrose broth (NYDA), and dilutions of the resulting suspension were streaked onto NYDA and potato dextrose agar (PDA). Isolations were made from at least 25 leaves. Plates were maintained at 22 ± 1°C for 48 h. No fungi were isolated from the spots on NYDA or PDA. Colonies typical of Pseudomonas species were consistently isolated on NYDA. Isolates were negative for levan, potato soft-rot (pectolytic activity), and arginine dehydrolase while positive for oxidase and hypersensitivity on tobacco leaves. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of whole-cell protein analysis (1) indicated that the bacterium isolated was similar to Pseudomonas cichorii (Swingle) Stapp NCPPB 943 and 3283 strains. On King's medium B, (2) a typical fluorescent pigment was produced. The pathogen was identified as Pseudomonas cichoriii. Pathogenicity of 10 colonies was tested by growing inoculum in nutrient-broth shake cultures for 48 h, suspending bacterial cultures in water, diluting to 106 CFU/ml, and spraying 10 1-year-old healthy plants of P. paniculata. Ten control plants were sprayed with sterile nutrient broth. Inoculated and control plants were kept covered with plastic bags for 72 h. After 8 days in a growth chamber at 20 ± 1°C, leaf spots identical to those observed in the field developed on leaves of inoculated plants. Control plants remained symptomless. The pathogenicity test was repeated once. Bacteria were reisolated from the spots and identified as P. cichoriii. To our knowledge, this is the first record of bacterial leaf spot of Phlox paniculata in Italy as well as in the world. References: (1) D. H. Bergey et al.

16628,First Report of Bacterial Leaf Spot Caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. viburnii on Viburnum sargentii in Italy.,"During the spring of 2003, plants of Viburnum sargentii, a species mostly used in gardens as low-maintenance hedges, showing symptoms unlike those of known diseases were observed in some private gardens in the Biella area (northern Italy). Lesions on leaves were the only symptoms seen. Lesions started as water-soaked, circular areas that in 4 days developed into irregular, shrunken, brown spots from 2 to 4 mm in diameter. The core of older lesions appeared somewhat transparent. Leaves dried up completely 3 weeks after symptoms were first seen. No fungal structures were observed in lesions. Microscopic examination of affected leaf tissues revealed abundant bacterial ooze from the cut margin of lesions. Small fragments of tissue from affected leaves were macerated in nutrient yeast dextrose broth (NYDA) and dilutions of the resulting suspension were streaked onto NYDA and potato dextrose agar (PDA). Isolations were made from at least 25 leaves. Plates were maintained at 22 ± 1°C for 48 h. Slightly yellow colonies typical of Pseudomonas species were consistently isolated on NYDA. No fungi were isolated from the spots on NYDA or PDA. Levan production, oxidase production, pectinolytic activity, arginin dihydrase production, and tobacco hypersensitivity (LOPAT) were tested. Strains were positive for levan and negative for oxidase, arginine dihydrolase, and nitrate reductase. Strains did not rot potato slices but induced a hypersensitive reaction on tobacco leaves. Protein analysis (1) indicated that the bacterium isolated was similar to Pseudomonas syringae pv. viburnii NCPPB 1921. The pathogen was identified as Pseudomonas syringae pv. viburnii (2,3). Pathogenicity of 10 colonies was tested by growing inoculum in nutrient broth shake cultures for 48 h, suspending bacterial cultures in water, diluting to 106 CFU/ml, and spraying five 1-year-old healthy plants of Viburnum sargentii. Five control plants were sprayed with sterile nutrient broth. Inoculated and control plants were kept covered with plastic bags for 72 h. After 7 days in a growth chamber at 20 ± 1°C, leaf spots identical to those observed in the field developed on leaves of inoculated plants. Control plants remained symptomless. The pathogenicity test was repeated once. Strains were isolated from the spots and identified as P. syringae pv. viburnii. To our knowledge, this is the first record of bacterial leaf spot of Viburnum sargentii in Europe.

16711,First Report of Bacterial Leaf Spot of Spinach Caused by a Pseudomonas syringae Pathovar in California.,"In 2000 and 2001, a new disease was observed on commercial spinach (Spinacia oleracea) in the Salinas Valley, Monterey County, CA. Initial symptoms were water-soaked, irregularly shaped leaf spots (2 to 3 mm diameter). As the disease developed, spots enlarged to as much as 1 to 2 cm, were vein-delimited, and turned dark brown. Faint chlorotic halos sometimes surrounded the spots. Death of large areas of the leaf occurred if spots coalesced. Spots were visible from the adaxial and abaxial sides of leaves, and no fungal structures were observed. The disease occurred on newly expanded and mature foliage. No fungi were isolated from the spots. However, cream-colored bacterial colonies were consistently isolated on sucrose peptone agar, and these strains were nonfluorescent on King's medium B. Strains were positive for levan and negative for oxidase, arginine dihydrolase, and nitrate reductase. Strains did not grow at 36°C, did not rot potato slices, but induced a hypersensitive reaction in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Turk). These results suggested the bacterium was similar to Pseudomonas syringae. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis (MIS-TSBA 4.10, MIDI Inc., Newark, DE) indicated the strains were highly similar (80.1 to 89.3%) to P. syringae pv. maculicola. However, in contrast to P. syringae pv. maculicola, the spinach strains did not utilize the carbon sources erythritol, L+tartrate, L lactate, and DL-homoserine. Pathogenicity of 10 strains was tested by growing inoculum in nutrient broth shake cultures for 48 h, diluting to 106 CFU/ml, and spraying 4-week-old plants of spinach cv. Bossanova. Control plants were sprayed with sterile nutrient broth. After 5 to 8 days in a greenhouse (24 to 26°C), leaf spots identical to those observed in the field developed on cotyledons and true leaves of inoculated plants. Strains were reisolated from the spots and identified as P. syringae. Control plants remained symptomless. The 10 strains were also inoculated on beet (Beta vulgaris), Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris subsp. cicla), cilantro (Coriandrum sativum), and spinach. Spinach showed leaf spots after 8 days; however, none of the other plants developed symptoms. Two strains were inoculated onto spinach cvs. Califlay, Lion, Nordic IV, Polka, Resistoflay, Rushmore, RZ 11, Spinnaker, Springfield, Viroflay, and Whitney. Leaf spot developed on all cultivars, and the pathogen was reisolated. Because the FAME data indicated a similarity between the spinach pathogen and P. syringae pv. maculicola, we inoculated sets of spinach cv. Bolero, cabbage (Brassica oleracea subsp. capitata cv. Grenedere), and cauliflower (Brassica oleracea subsp. botrytis cv. White Rock) with three P. syringae pv. maculicola and three spinach strains. Cabbage and cauliflower developed leaf spots only when inoculated with P. syringae pv. maculicola; spinach had leaf spots only when inoculated with the spinach strains. All inoculation experiments were done twice, and the results of the two tests were the same. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bacterial leaf spot of spinach in California caused by a nonfluorescent P. syringae, and the first record of this disease in the United States. Biochemical characteristics and limited host range of the pathogen indicate the California strains are likely the same as the P. syringae pv. spinaciae pathogen that was reported in Italy (1) and Japan (2).

17454,An endophytic Pseudonocardia species induces the production of artemisinin in Artemisia annua.,"Endophytic actinobacteria colonize internal tissues of their host plants and are considered as a rich and reliable source of diverse species and functional microorganisms. In this study, endophytic actinobacterial strain YIM 63111 was isolated from surface-sterilized tissue of the medicinal plant Artemisia annua. We identified strain YIM 63111 as a member of the genus Pseudonocardia. A. annua seedlings grown under both sterile and greenhouse conditions were inoculated with strain YIM 63111. The growth of A. annua seedlings was strongly reduced when YIM 63111 was inoculated at higher concentrations under sterile conditions. However, no growth inhibition was observed when A. annua was grown under greenhouse conditions. Using an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expressing YIM 63111 strain, we also observed the endophytic colonization of A. annua seedling using confocal laser-scanning microscopy. The transcription levels of the key genes involved in artemisinin biosynthesis were investigated using real time RT-PCR, revealing that cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP71AV1) and cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (CPR) expression were up-regulated in A. annua upon inoculation with strain YIM 63111 under certain conditions. The up-regulation of these genes was associated with the increased accumulation of artemisinin.

12586,FUNGAL CONTAMINATION IN TWO PORTUGUESE WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS,"The presence of filamentous fungi was detected in wastewater and air collected at wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) from several European countries. The aim of the present study was to assess fungal contamination in two WWTP operating in Lisbon. In addition, particulate matter (PM) contamination data was analyzed. To apply conventional methods, air samples from the two plants were collected through impaction using an air sampler with a velocity air rate of 140 L/min. Surfaces samples were collected by swabbing the surfaces of the same indoor sites. All collected samples were incubated at 27 degrees C for 5 to 7 d. After lab processing and incubation of collected samples, quantitative and qualitative results were obtained with identification of the isolated fungal species. For molecular methods, air samples of 250 L were also collected using the impinger method at 300 L/min airflow rate. Samples were collected into 10 ml sterile phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Triton X-100, and the collection liquid was subsequently used for DNA extraction. Molecular identification of Aspergillus fumigatus and Stachybotrys chartarum was achieved by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the Rotor-Gene 6000 qPCR Detection System (Corbett). Assessment of PM was also conducted with portable direct-reading equipment (Lighthouse, model 3016 IAQ). Particles concentration measurement was performed at five different sizes: PM0.5, PM1, PM2.5, PM5, and PM10. Sixteen different fungal species were detected in indoor air in a total of 5400 isolates in both plants. Penicillium sp. was the most frequently isolated fungal genus (58.9%), followed by Aspergillus sp. (21.2%) and Acremonium sp. (8.2%), in the total underground area. In a partially underground plant, Penicillium sp. (39.5%) was also the most frequently isolated, also followed by Aspergillus sp. (38.7%) and Acremonium sp. (9.7%). Using RT-PCR, only A. fumigatus was detected in air samples collected, and only from partial underground plant. Stachybotrys chartarum was not detected in any of the samples analyzed. The distribution of particle sizes showed the same tendency in both plants; however, the partially underground plant presented higher levels of contamination, except for PM2.5. Fungal contamination assessment is crucial to evaluating the potential health risks to exposed workers in these settings. In order to achieve an evaluation of potential health risks to exposed workers, it is essential to combine conventional and molecular methods for fungal detection. Protective measures to minimize worker exposure to fungi need to be adopted since wastewater is the predominant internal fungal source in this setting.","Viegas, C; Faria, T; Gomes, AQ; Sabino, R; Seco, A; Viegas, S",JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES,2014,10.1080/15287394.2014.866925,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.975403813993596,TRUE,4,12,Medium,sterile; not detected,isolated; incubated; sterile; pcr; qpcr; analyzed; collected,"using the impinger method at 300 L/min airflow rate.

18119,[A preliminary study on origin of ligustrazine in Chuanxiong Rhizoma based on endogenetic Bacillus subtilis].,"Ligustrazine is an important active ingredient of the traditional Chinese medicine Chuanxiong Rhizoma, but its content is a controversial topic. The endophytes of medicinal plants have the ability to produce the same active substances as the host, so this report focused on the endophytic Bacillus subtilis, to study the origin of ligustrazine in Chuanxiong Rhizoma preliminarily by inoculating the isolated endophytic B. subtilis to the Chuanxiong Rhizoma medium in vitro for solid state fermentation. Tissue grinding method was used to isolate the endogenetic B. subtilis. The morphological features, conventional physiological and biochemical reactions and 16S rRNA molecular techniques were combined to identify the endogenetic strains. Then, the strains that grew well in the medicinal matrix of Chuanxiong Rhizoma were screened out for further fermentation studies. The solid-state fermentation was performed at 37 °C for 30 d using Chuanxiong Rhizoma fermentation medium (40 g Chuanxiong Rhizoma powder, 100 mL sterile water, 121 °C, sterilization for 25 minutes). UPLC was used to detect the contents of ligustrazine, acetoin in the Chuanxiong Rhizoma fermentation medium and Chuanxiong Rhizoma. All the five strains were Gram-positive and had spores. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA sequence showed that the endophytes were B. subtilis. The results of UPLC showed that ligustrazine was detected in the Chuanxiong Rhizoma fermentation medium inoculated with endogenetic B. subtilis LB3, LB3-2-1, LB4, LB5 and LB6-2, while not detected neither in blank Chuanxiong Rhizoma fermentation medium nor in Chuanxiong Rhizoma. This study showed that the endogenetic B. subtilis of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. can make use of Chuanxiong Rhizoma fermentation medium to produce ligustrazine. Endogenetic B. subtilis has a certain correlation with the accumulation of ligustrazine in Rhizoma Chuanxiong.

15134,A preliminary investigation on the production of lovastatin from an endophytic fungus Nigrospora sp. isolated from Cymbopogon schoenanthus,"In the past decade, changing diet and lifestyle have increased the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Increased levels of blood cholesterol are major contributors for these diseases. Drugs are available that target the synthesis of cholesterol via HMG-CoA reductase enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Lovastatin is one such drug that inhibits HMG-CoA reductase enzyme, thereby reducing the level of blood cholesterol. Microbial production of lovastatin is a cost effective way when compared to chemical route of synthesis.

17392,Endophytic Burkholderia fungorum DBT1 can improve phytoremediation efficiency of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.,"Burkholderia fungorum DBT1 is a bacterial strain isolated from an oil refinery discharge and capable of transforming dibenzothiophene, phenanthrene, naphthalene, and fluorene. In order to evaluate the influence of a policyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-transforming bacterial strain on the phytoremediation of organic contaminants, B. fungorum DBT1 was inoculated into hybrid poplar (Populus deltoides×Populus nigra). The poplar plants were grown for 18-wk with or without naphthalene, phenanthrene, fluorene and dibenzothiophene (488mgkg(-1) soil each) in non-sterile sand-peat substrate. Evidences were gained that B. fungorum DBT1 was present in high concentration in poplar root tissues (2.9-9.5×10(3)CFUg(-1)), while the strain was not detected in stem, leaves and rhizosphere. When poplar was planted in uncontaminated substrate, the infection caused negative effects on biomass index, leaves and stem dry weight, without showing however any disease symptoms. On the other hand, plants inoculated with the strain DBT1 resulted in better tolerance against the toxic effects of PAHs, in terms of root dry weight. Although the presence of plants acted as the main effective treatment for PAH dissipation (82-87%), the inoculum with DBT1 strain lead to the highest PAH abatement (up to 99%). In the present study, an environmental isolate with proper metabolic features was demonstrated to be possibly suitable as a poplar endophyte for improving microbe-assisted phytoremediation in PAH contaminated matrices.",Andreolli M; Lampis S; Poli M; Gullner G; Biró B; Vallini G,Chemosphere,2013,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.04.033,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994190217531393,TRUE,4,4,Medium,sterile; not detected,isolated; sterile,"DBT1 was present in high concentration in poplar root tissues (2.9-9.5×10(3)CFUg(-1)), while the strain was not detected in stem, leaves and rhizosphere.

723,Influence of soil microbiota onTaxodium distichumseedling performance during extreme flooding events,"Plant associations with soil microbiota can modulate tree seedling growth and survival via mutualistic or antagonistic interactions. It is uncertain, however, whether soil microbiota influence seedling growth of coastal trees when exposed to extreme flooding regimes. We evaluated the role of soil microbes in promoting baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) seedling performance under different inundation scenarios and determined the influence of flooding on the colonization ofin plantabeneficial microbes. Seedlings reared in sterile and non-sterile soil were exposed to three different flooding regimes historically experienced in Louisiana swamps. Seedling growth was assessed, and the colonization by beneficial symbionts such as arbuscular mycorrizhal fungi (AMF), and dark septate endophytes (DSE) was evaluated in harvested roots. Seedlings grown in sterile soil had six times higher growth than seedlings reared in non-sterile soil. As a result, we evaluated pathogen load in the roots by assessing oomycete colonization. Flooding influenced thein plantacolonization of DSE and oomycetes, but did not affect the colonization of mutualist AMF fungi. DSE and oomycetes were rarer in flooded conditions, while AMF remained abundant. Seedling biomass production was not correlated within plantafungal colonization or pathogen load. Soil microbiota can negatively influence baldcypress seedling growth, and no growth benefit was evidenced from the root colonization of mutualist fungi. Flooding can modify baldcypress-fungal interactions by diminishing colonization of DSE. Overall, baldycpress seedlings were more sensitive to the presence of microbiota than flooding, and thus restoration efforts should focus on having a better understanding of plant-microbe interactions in swamps.","Torres-Martínez, L; Sánchez-Julia, M; Kimbrough, E; Hendrix, TC; Hendrix, M; Day, RH; Krauss, KW; Van Bael, SA",PLANT ECOLOGY,2020,10.1007/s11258-020-01059-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994072682791625,TRUE,4,4,Medium,no growth; sterile,sterile; assessed; evaluated,"within plantafungal colonization or pathogen load.

782,Tall fescue cultivar and fungal endophyte combinations influence plant growth and root exudate composition,"Tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.)] is a cool-season perennial grass used in pastures throughout the Southeastern United States. The grass can harbor a shoot-specific fungal endophyte (Epichloe coenophiala) thought to provide the plant with enhanced resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Because alkaloids produced by the common variety of the endophyte cause severe animal health issues, focus has been on replacing the common-toxic strain with novel varieties that do not produce the mammal-toxic alkaloids but maintain abiotic and biotic stress tolerance benefits. Little attention has been given to the influence of the plant-fungal symbiosis on rhizosphere processes. Therefore, our objective was to study the influence of this relationship on plant biomass production and root exudate composition in tall fescue cultivars PDF and 97TF1, which were either not infected with the endophyte (E-), infected with the common toxic endophyte (CIE+) strain or with one of two novel endophytes (AR542E(+), AR584E(+)). Plants were grown sterile for 3 weeks after which plant biomass, total organic carbon, total phenolic content and detailed chemical composition of root exudates were determined. Plant biomass production and exudate phenolic and organic carbon content were influenced by endophyte status, tall fescue cultivar, and their interaction. GC-TOF MS identified 132 compounds, including lipids, carbohydrates and carboxylic acids. Cluster analysis showed that the interaction between endophyte and cultivar resulted in unique exudate profiles. This is the first detailed study to assess how endophyte infection, notably with novel endophytes, and tall fescue cultivar interact to influence root exudate composition. Our results illustrate that tall fescue cultivar and endophyte status can influence plant growth and root exudate composition, which may help explain the observed influence of this symbiosis on rhizosphere biogeochemical processes.","Guo, J; McCulley, RL; McNear, DH",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2015,10.3389/fpls.2015.00183,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.968193822387252,TRUE,4,4,Medium,sterile; not infected,sterile; observed,"endophyte (CIE+) strain or with one of two novel endophytes (AR542E(+), AR584E(+)).

9502,BIOLOGY OF MYCORRHIZA IN HELIANTHEMUM MILL,"The mycorrhizal status of H. chamaecistus was assessed. Vegetative and reproductive tissues of mature plants were free from infection by a fungus capable of producing mycorrhizas and were normally free from any internal fungal infection. The mature gelatinous sheath of the seed was infected by a number of non-mycorrhizal fungi of which the most common were the saprophytes, Cladosporium herbarum and Ulocladium chartarum. The so-called tuberous roots are typical ecto-mycorrhizal short roots. They develop following infection by a soil-borne sclerotium-producing fungus. Isolates of the sclerotia and roots produced typical mycorrhizal short roots in sterile cultures of both Helianthemum and Betula pubescens. This mycorrhizal associate is believed to be Cenococcum graniforme.

Further, we evaluated the relationships of fungi with the host plant and tested bioactivities of isolates. The fungi were isolated from disinfected root fragments and plated onto potato dextrose agar. Root pieces were also used to quantify fungal structures associated with the roots. Identification of fungi was carried out by characterization of morphological features and sequencing of the ITS region. Endophytism was confirmed by inoculation of endophyte-free seedlings followed by microscopic examination. The extract was obtained by maceration of the mycelium in ethyl acetate for antioxidant and antimicrobial evaluations. A total of 112 strains belonging to nine different species were isolated, the major classes were Dothideomycetes and Sordariomycetes. C. lanceolatum is colonized by dark septate endophytes (DSE), evidenced by the presence of microsclerotia and melanized hyphae. There is also co-colonization with mycorrhizal fungi in the same root fragments. Seedling inoculation experiments revealed that C. perangustum-95C and M. phaseolina-46C showed association with the seedlings of C. lanceolatum and differentiated microsclerotia and dark septate hyphae, indicating that these species are DSE. In the antimicrobial test, the D. phaseolorum-92C extract had the highest zones of inhibition against S. aureus and E. coli, respectively. The results showed that 100 % of the extracts have antioxidant activity ranging from low to moderate. All endophyte species had antioxidant and antimicrobial activities that were directly proportional to the dose-responses.

Most of them have antifungal properties. EFs of three herbaceous plants namely Lantana camara, Emilia coccinae and Bryophyllum pinnatum were isolated by using potato dextrose agar medium (PDA) and screened for their antifungal activity on the double direct confrontation (DDC) test on PDA. The growth diameter of pathogenic fungi with or without endophyte was measured weekly. Then, fourteen days after the DDC test, fungicidal or fungistatic activity of the EFs was assessed on the pathogens' growth. Finally, EFs that strongly inhibited pathogens' growth was submitted to the cultural characterization on PDA, Malt Extract Agar (MEA) and Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) media at three pH levels (5.2, 7 and 9). Results showed that eight EFs genera are associated with these herbaceous medicinal plants with diverse antifungal activities. EFs that significantly (p <0.05) inhibited the growth of the three pathogenic fungi were: Trichoderma harzianum (66%), Cercospora sp (58%) and Aspergillus sp (49%), 7 days after the DDC test. Endophytes T. harzianum and Cercospora sp were fungicidal on the three pathogens while Aspergillus sp was fungicidal on V. albo-atrum and R. carotae. There was a high morphological variability (colour, texture and pigments produced by EFs on culture media), and variability in their daily growth diameter and sporulation among EFs from one medium to another and from one pH level to another.

3019,Epichloë Endophyte Alters Bacterial Nitrogen-Cycling Gene Abundance in the Rhizosphere Soil of Perennial Ryegrass,"Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), an important forage and turfgrass species, can establish a mutualistic symbiosis with the fungal endophyte Epichlo & euml; festucae var. lolii. Although the physiological and ecological impacts of endophyte infection on ryegrass have been extensively investigated, the response of the soil microbial community and nitrogen-cycling gene to this relationship has received much less attention. The present study emphasized abundance and diversity variation in the AOB-amoA, nirK and nosZ functional genes in the rhizosphere soil of the endophyte-ryegrass symbiosis following litter addition. We sampled four times: at T0 (prior to first litter addition), T1 (post 120 d of 1st litter addition), T2 (post 120 d of 2nd litter addition) and T3 (post 120 d of 3rd litter addition) times. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR) and PCR amplification and sequencing were used to characterize the abundance and diversity of the AOB-amoA, nirK and nosZ genes in rhizosphere soils of endophyte-infected (E+) plants and endophyte-free (E-) plants. A significant enhancement of total Phosphorus (P), Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), Ammonium ion (NH4+) and Nitrate ion (NO3-) contents in the rhizosphere soil was recorded in endophyte-infected plants at different sampling times compared to endophyte-free plants (p <= 0.05). The absolute abundance of the AOB-amoA gene at T0 and T1 times was higher, as was the absolute abundance of the nosZ gene at T0, T1 and T3 times in the E+ plant rhizophere soils relative to E- plant rhizosphere soils. A significant change in relative abundance of the AOB-amoA and nosZ genes in the host rhizophere soils of endophyte-infected plants at T1 and T3 times was observed. The experiment failed to show any significant alteration in abundance and diversity of the nirK gene, and diversity of the AOB-amoA and nosZ genes. Analysis of the abundance and diversity of the nirK gene indicated that changes in soil properties accounted for approximately 70.38% of the variation along the first axis and 16.69% along the second axis, and soil NH4+ (p = 0.002, 50.4%) and soil C/P ratio (p = 0.012, 15.8%) had a strong effect. The changes in community abundance and diversity of the AOB-amoA and nosZ genes were mainly related to soil pH, N/P ratio and NH4+ content.

Methods We utilized Sanger and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) for taxonomic authentication of fifteen herbal supplements representing three different producers from five medicinal plants: Echinacea purpurea, Valeriana officinalis, Ginkgo biloba, Hypericum perforatum and Trigonella foenum-graecum. Experimental design included three modifications of DNA extraction, two lysate dilutions, Internal Amplification Control, and multiple negative controls to exclude background contamination. Ginkgo supplements were also analyzed using HPLC-MS for the presence of active medicinal components. Results All supplements yielded DNA from multiple species, rendering Sanger sequencing results for rbcL and ITS2 regions either uninterpretable or non-reproducible between the experimental replicates. Overall, DNA from the manufacturer-listed medicinal plants was successfully detected in seven out of eight dry herb form supplements; however, low or poor DNA recovery due to degradation was observed in most plant extracts (none detected by Sanger; three out of seven-by NGS). NGS also revealed a diverse community of fungi, known to be associated with live plant material and/or the fermentation process used in the production of plant extracts. HPLC-MS testing demonstrated that Ginkgo supplements with degraded DNA contained ten key medicinal components. Conclusion Quality control of herbal supplements should utilize a synergetic approach targeting both DNA and bioactive components, especially for standardized extracts with degraded DNA. The NGS workflow developed in this study enables reliable detection of plant and fungal DNA and can be utilized by manufacturers for quality assurance of raw plant materials, contamination control during the production process, and the final product.

10599,Fungal endophyte colonization coincides with altered DNA methylation in drought-stressed wheat seedlings,"Drought stress is one of the greatest limiting factors to Canadian agricultural production. The endophytic fungus SMCD 2206 improves wheat tolerance for drought. However, the mechanism(s) by which this mycobiont interacts with its host are not known. Methyl-sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) was used to test the hypothesis that the endophyte colonization is associated with epigenetic modifications in drought-stressed wheat. Such epigenetic changes might be linked to elevated plant drought resistance. The DNA methylation patterns observed in drought-stressed wheat seedlings co-cultured with SMCD 2206 resembled those of unstressed controls (with or without the endophyte) much more closely than those of endophyte-free, drought-stressed plants. Consistent with the documented roles of transposable elements in plant epigenetics, DNA sequences isolated from some of the most prominent polymorphic MSAP bands were similar to a CACTA type transposon and two retrotransposons of Gypsy and Copia types. Another polymorphic band was similar to a wheat cytochrome p450 expressed sequence tag, suggesting that inoculation may be linked to altered plant responses to oxidative stress in drought conditions.

6865,Effects of root endophytic fungi on response of Chenopodium quinoa to drought stress,"Symbiotic associations with microbes can help plants to respond to environmental changes. In this study, we investigated how colonization by root endophytic fungi enhances performance of Chenopodium quinoa and its ability to cope with extended periods of drought. The fungus Penicillium minioluteum, which was isolated from quinoa naturally occurring in the Atacama Desert, was used for endophyte colonization. We developed a greenhouse experiment, subjecting endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) plants to two treatments: water deficit and abundant water availability. Differences in plant performance, photosynthesis, water-use efficiency and photochemical efficiency between E+ and E- plants under both water treatments were examined. We assessed the nature of the plant-symbiont interaction (parasitic or mutualistic) under both treatment conditions. We found that P. minioluteum initially affected radicle growth, subsequently triggering improvements in root formation, with the latter particularly evident under drought conditions. Under low water, E+ plants demonstrated a 40% improvement in root formation relative to E- plants; however, physiological responses to drought were not demonstrably enhanced by the presence of endophytic fungi. The nature of the interaction appeared to be positive, but only under conditions of water stress. Our study demonstrates that, in C. quinoa, P. minioluteum assists in coping with water stress primarily by affecting substantial root biomass adjustments, and that host benefits in this relationship are conferred in conditions of stress only.","González-Teuber, M; Urzúa, A; Plaza, P; Bascuñán-Godoy, L",PLANT ECOLOGY,2018,10.1007/s11258-017-0791-1,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.971049066060232,TRUE,3,9,Medium,endophyte-free,isolated; ITS; examined; investigated; examined; assessed,"Desert, was used for endophyte colonization.

Endophytes, fungi and bacteria that live within plant hosts without impacting the host negatively, have exhibited antagonism to V. dahliae. The objectives of this study were to survey potential V. dahliae-antagonistic endophytes from roots of 'Cinnamon Girl' pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) grown under either polyethylene (PE), an experimental polylactic acid/poly(hydroxalkanoate) (PLA/PHA) mulch, Weed Guard Plus, or no mulch, as well as from 'Sugar Baby' watermelon (Citrullus lanatus), and 'Tetsukabuto' squash (C. maxima x C. moschata). Four selected endophytes were screened for antagonism against V. dahliae in the laboratory, greenhouse, and field. A total of 777 isolates of potential fungal endophytes were recovered from pumpkin, watermelon, and squash roots between 2015 and 2016 of which 198 isolates were identified down to the genus level. Of those isolates, frequency of isolation was greatest for Dichotomopilus/Chaetomium spp. (5%), Cladosporium spp. (15.2 %), Clonostachys spp. (5.6 %), Epicoccum spp. (22.2 %), and Fusarium spp. (24.7 %).

17888,Diazinon degradation by bacterial endophytes in rice plant (Oryzia sativa L.): A possible reason for reducing the efficiency of diazinon in the control of the rice stem-borer.,"It is well known that microorganisms can reduce the effectiveness of organophosphate pesticides after their application. But, little information is available concerning the effect of rice endophytic bacteria on the degradation of diazinon, an organophosphate pesticide used in control of the rice stem-borer, absorbed by the rice plant. Thus, aim of this study was to characterize the endophytic bacterial isolates, isolated from diazinon-treated and non-treated rice plants in paddy fields, in terms of diazinon degradation and to investigate whether potent isolates that degrade diazinon in vitro might have the same effect in the rice plant. The results showed that all endophytic isolates, isolated from both groups of rice plants (diazinon-treated and non-treated rice plants), could grow in mineral salt medium (MSM) supplemented with diazinon (20 mg L-1) as a sole carbon source, and 3.79-58.52% of the initial dose of the insecticide was degraded by the isolates within 14 d of incubation. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16 S rRNA sequencing indicated that the potent isolates (DB26-R and B6-L) clearly belonged to the Bacillus genus. The diazinon concentrations in rice plants co-inoculated with B. altitudinis DB26-R and B. subtilis subsp.

2181,ERGOPEPTINE ALKALOID PRODUCTION BY ENDOPHYTES IN A COMMON TALL FESCUE GENOTYPE,"The fungal endophyte, Acremonium coenophialum Morgan-Jones & Gams, is present in many tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Shreb.) pastures. It imparts fitness-related traits to the tall fescue plant but produces ergopeptine alkaloids, which may be the cause of fescue toxicosis in grazing livestock. Inasmuch as the endophyte provides the plant with added vigor, development of endophyte-infected tall fescue populations that are incapable of producing ergopeptine alkaloids may be a solution to providing a sustainable nontoxic grass base for livestock producers. Our objective was to study changes in ergopeptide alkaloid production in a common tall fescue genotype that was infected by two different endophyte isolates that express different levels of alkaloids when in their host plants. Endophyte-free tall fescue Genotype PDN2 explants were cultured in vitro to obtain 28-d-old calli. Endophytes EDN2 and EDN11 isolated from infected PDN2 and another plant genotype PDN11 were cultured and inserted into germinating somatic embryos by placing pieces of mycelium into slits at the base of the noninfected embryonic PDN2 explant. Both endophyte-infected and -free plants were regenerated from callus culture. Regenerated plants with each reinfected endophyte were grown with their endophyte-infected naturally occurring forms to compare endophyte behavior within a common plant genotype under greenhouse conditions. The PDN11 plant with its naturally occurring endophyte was a high alkaloid producer while PDN2 was a low alkaloid producer. When the endophytes EDN11 and EDN2 were reinfected into noninfected individuals of PDN2, the resulting plants were low alkaloid producers. These data suggest that the plant plays a major role in controlling the expression of the genetic potential of endophytes for ergopeptine alkaloid production.","HILL, NS; PARROTT, WA; POPE, DD",CROP SCIENCE,1991,10.2135/cropsci1991.0011183X003100060033x,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.99010887064405,TRUE,3,8,Medium,endophyte-free,cultured; isolated; culture; ITS,two different endophyte isolates that express different levels of alkaloids when in their host plants.

Based on morphology, physiological characteristics and the 16S rRNA gene sequence, it was identified as Massilia sp. Strain Pn2 could degrade more than 95% of the phenanthrene (150 mg · L(-1)) in a minimal salts medium (MSM) within 48 hours at an initial pH of 7.0 and a temperature of 30 °C. Pn2 could grow well on the MSM plates with a series of other PAHs, including naphthalene, acenaphthene, anthracene and pyrene, and degrade them to different degrees.

12711,Wheat fungal endophyte communities are inseparable from the host and influence plant development,"Plants harbor complex and highly diverse fungal endophyte communities (FECs), making it difficult to evaluate the functional role of individual taxa, subsets of the community, or the FEC as a whole. To reduce the complexity of this system, we aimed to produce fungi-null wheat (Triticum aestivum) plants. To this end, we treated seeds with heat and fungicides and generated plants from rescued embryos and callus tissue. A culture-based approach and reverse transcription PCR analysis were negative, indicating that all treatments produced plants apparently free of fungi. However, the analysis of DNA using digital droplet PCR and next-generation sequencing revealed that tissues from all treatments retained low levels but diversity-rich FECs. While the FECs varied in composition across treatments and tissues, they all included core taxa of the mycobiome. The reduced fungal biomass, along with the changes in FEC composition, negatively affected plant development, supporting a FEC contribution to proper plant development and fitness. Our discovery that a large part of the FEC cannot be separated from plants and can be transmitted through seeds and tissue culture calls for reevaluation of particular microbiome paradigms, such as core taxa concepts, transmission modes, and functional species. IMPORTANCE The native microbiome in a given plant must be considered when evaluating the effect of a single taxon or synthetic community. The pre-existing microbiome can interact with artificially added microbial cargo, which affects the final outcome. Such issues can be at least partially solved by the use of endophyte-free plants, which provide a clean background that should be useful in determining the effect of a single taxon, taxa combinations, or the entire microbiome on plant performance. Previous reports regarded plants as endophyte-free or axenic by the lack of fungal growth on culture media or the generation of plants from tissue cultures. We showed here that while fungi could not be isolated from fungicide-treated or tissue culture-regenerated plants, nevertheless, all plants contained rich fungal endophyte communities; namely, it was impossible to create fungi-free wheat plants.

Fortunately, it has been established that seed detoxification techniques and isolation of endophytic fungi infect non-endophytic fungi populations with the same genetic background as endophyte-infected Achnatherum inebrians. Moreover, sheep can use endophyte-free Achnatherum inebriants (EF) without obvious toxicity symptoms. The present study selected EF as a representative grass, consisting of five different replacement levels, EF0, EF25, EF50, EF75, and EF100, corresponding to 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the fermentation substrate, respectively. Simultaneously, in vitro fermentation and the 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing method was used to explore the effect of EF on sheep ruminal fermentation and microbial diversity. The results revealed that EF100 had the highest values for pH, acetate: propionate, the Patescibacteria, Kiritimatiellaeota, and Synergistetes phylum levels, Ruminococcaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Saccharofermentans genus levels than the other treatments (p < 0.05). In contrast, EF25 was associated with higher levels of abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE), Chaol index of the phyla Synergistetes and Bacteroidetes, and of the genus Erysipelotrichaceae, Rikenellaceae, and Prevotella as compared with other treatments (p < 0.05).

2024,Soil fungal and bacterial communities are altered by the incorporation of leaf litter containing a fungal endophyte,"Litter decomposition plays a key role in nutrient cycling across ecosystems. The presence of Epichloe endophytes in grass plants affects litter decomposition. The overall effects of leaf litter containing Epichloe endophytes on the chemical and biological properties in non-rhizosphere soils have not previously been examined. The current study is aimed to understand the effect of direct incorporation of leaf litter from Epichloe endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) on soil chemical characteristics, and fungal and bacterial biodiversity. Firstly, fresh leaf litter of the endophyte Epichloe festucae var. lolii-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) L. perenne were incorporated into the soil, and then samples were collected from E+ and E- litter incorporated soil at T-0, T-1, T-2 and T-3 (0, 120, 240 and 360 days) for chemical and sequencing analyses. The Epichloe-containing leaf litter incorporation changed the soil microbial environment by enhancing the soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus, NH4+-N and NO3--N contents, and acidifying soil pH. The endophyte had stronger effects on soil bacteria than soil fungi when the litter was determined with and without the endophyte. Litter containing the Epichloe endophyte significantly increased the absolute abundance of the 16S rRNA gene and relative abundances of the Actinobacteria, Nitrospirae and Gemmatimonadetes, while significantly decreasing the relative abundances of the Planctomycetes and Rokubacteria and the diversity in soil bacteria community. There was no significant effect of endophyte-containing leaf litter incorporation on the absolute abundance and diversity of the soil fungal community except the increment in the relative abundance of Rozellomycota. Soil pH and the SOC-to-TN ratio (C:N) were the main factors influencing the soil bacterial community, and the presence of E. festucae var. lolii was directly and positively related to the soil bacterial diversity. The current study established that Epichloe endophyte-infection altered the abundance and diversity of the soil bacterial community by affecting leaf litter quality and increasing soil chemical properties after litter incorporation. Highlights Soil microbial habitat was changed by leaf litter with Epichloe endophyte incorporation. Litter containing endophytes increased the absolute abundance of the 16S rRNA gene. Epichloe endophytes altered the diversity of bacteria during litter incorporation.

2059,Seed Transmission of Epichloe Endophytes in Lolium perenne Is Heavily Influenced by Host Genetics,"Vertical transmission of symbiotic Epichloe endophytes from host grasses into progeny seed is the primary mechanism by which the next generation of plants is colonized. This process is often imperfect, resulting in endophyte-free seedlings which may have poor ecological fitness if the endophyte confers protective benefits to its host. In this study, we investigated the influence of host genetics and environment on the vertical transmission of Epichloe festucae var. bill strain AR37 in the temperate forage grass Lolium perenne. The efficiency of AR37 transmission into the seed of over 500 plant genotypes from five genetically diverse breeding populations was determined. In Populations I-III, which had undergone previous selection for high seed infection by AR37, mean transmission was 88, 93, and 92%, respectively. However, in Populations IV and V, which had not undergone previous selection, mean transmission was 69 and 70%, respectively. The transmission values, together with single-nucleotide polymorphism data obtained using genotyping-by-sequencing for each host, was used to develop a genomic prediction model for AR37 seed transmission. The predictive ability of the model was estimated at r = 0.54. While host genotype contributed greatly to differences in AR37 seed transmission, undefined environmental variables also contributed significantly to seed transmission across different years and geographic locations. There was evidence for a small host genotype-by-environment effect; however this was less pronounced than genotype or environment alone. Analysis of endophyte infection levels in parent plants within Populations I and IV revealed a loss of endophyte infection over time in Population IV only. This population also had lower average tiller infection frequencies than Population I, suggesting that AR37 failed to colonize all the daughter tillers and therefore seeds. However, we also observed that infection of seed by AR37 may fail during or after initiation of floral development from plants where all tillers remained endophyte-infected over time. While the effects of environment and host genotype on fungal endophyte transmission have been evaluated previously, this is the first study that quantifies the relative impacts of host genetics and environment on endophyte vertical transmission.","Gagic, M; Faville, MJ; Zhang, W; Forester, NT; Rolston, MP; Johnson, RD; Ganesh, S; Koolaard, JP; Easton, HS; Hudson, D; Johnson, LJ; Moon, CD; Voisey, CR",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2018,10.3389/fpls.2018.01580,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.977210431216251,TRUE,3,8,Medium,endophyte-free,sequencing; ITS; observed; investigated; evaluated,"which the next generation of plants is colonized.

17968,Effects of endophyte-infected tall fescue seed and protein supplementation on stocker steers: II. Adaptive and innate immune function.,"Fescue toxicosis is a multifaceted syndrome common in cattle grazing endophyte-infected tall fescue that affects performance; however, little information is available pertaining to its effects on immunity. Recently, it has been shown that supplemental CP can improve performance in weaned steers postvaccination. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of supplemental CP on innate and adaptive immune responses in stocker steers chronically exposed to ergovaline. Angus steers (n = 12 pens; 3 steers/pen) were stratified by weight and assigned to a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement to examine crude protein levels of supplement (14% or 18%) and ergovaline exposure (0 or 185 μg ergovaline/kg BW/d via ground endophyte-free (EF) or endophyte-infected (EI) tall fescue seed, respectively) on immune response. Consumption of low to moderate concentration of ergovaline from EI tall fescue seed was sufficient to induce mild symptoms associated with fescue toxicosis. Blood samples were collected at day 0, 42, and 56 to evaluate infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) type 1b titers following vaccine challenge. Additionally, serum cytokine concentrations were evaluated using Quantibody Bovine Cytokine Arrays on day 0, 28, and 42. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED of SAS with repeated measures. Regardless of treatment, no differences were observed in IBR and BVDV-1b seroconversion following vaccine challenge (P > 0.05). Regardless of crude protein concentration, EI steers had greater concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1α), chemokines (CCL2, CCL4, MIG), anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, -13, -15, -21), and various growth factors (FGF-1, IGF-1, VEGF-A) when compared to EF steers (P < 0.05). Furthermore, VEGF-A and IGF-1 concentrations were greater in EI-14 steers on day 28 compared to EI-18, EF-14, and EF-18 steers (P < 0.05), however, this difference was not observed on day 0 or 42 (P > 0.05). Based on these data, steers exposed to ergovaline have an increase in pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and supplemental CP had minimal impact to mitigate this response. However, in the current study, exposure to ergovaline had little to no effect on adaptive immunity and response to vaccination. Together, chronic exposure to ergovaline results in a hyperactive innate immune response, which may lead to an immuno-compromised animal.",Poole RK; Brown AR; Poore MH; Pickworth CL; Poole DH,Journal of animal science,2019,10.1093/jas/skz250,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.917292415785619,TRUE,3,7,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS; observed; analyzed; collected; evaluated,"supplement (14% or 18%) and ergovaline exposure (0 or 185 μg ergovaline/kg BW/d via ground endophyte-free (EF) or endophyte-infected (EI) tall fescue seed, respectively) on immune response.

1745,Influence of Tall Fescue Epichloe Endophytes on Rhizosphere Soil Microbiome,"Tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) S.J. Darbyshire) often forms a symbiotic relationship with fungal endophytes (Epichloe coenophiala), which provides increased plant performance and greater tolerance to environmental stress compared to endophyte-free tall fescue. Whether this enhanced performance of tall fescue exclusively results from the grass-fungus symbiosis, or this symbiosis additionally results in the recruitment of soil microbes in the rhizosphere that in turn promote plant growth, remain a question. We investigated the soil bacterial and fungal community composition in iron-rich soil in the southeastern USA, and possible community shifts in soil microbial populations based on endophyte infection in tall fescue by analyzing the 16s rRNA gene and ITS specific region. Our data revealed that plant-available phosphorus (P) was significantly (p < 0.05) influenced by endophyte infection in tall fescue. While the prominent soil bacterial phyla were similar, a clear fungal community shift was observed between endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) tall fescue soil at the phylum level. Moreover, compared to E- soil, E+ soil showed a greater fungal diversity at the genus level. Our results, thus, indicate a possible three-way interaction between tall fescue, fungal endophyte, and soil fungal communities resulting in improved tall fescue performance.","Mahmud, K; Lee, K; Hill, NS; Mergoum, A; Missaoui, A",MICROORGANISMS,2021,10.3390/microorganisms9091843,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.821763912933856,TRUE,3,7,Medium,endophyte-free,rrna; ITS; observed; investigated,"(Epichloe coenophiala), which provides increased plant performance and greater tolerance to environmental stress compared to endophyte-free tall fescue.

14460,Allelopathic effect of endophyte-infected Achnatherum sibiricum on stipa grandis,"Endophytes are commonly defined as fungi that colonize internal tissues of plants for all or part of their life cycle. The largest plant family hosting endophytes is Poaceae. Enhanced competitive ability of endophyte-infected grasses has been well documented, including improved shoot and root growth, and greater resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the role of endophytes on the allelopathic effect of host grass is less studied. Achnatherum sibiricum is a perennial sparse bunchgrass, which always occurs as an accompanying species, and is typically highly infected by fungal endophytes. A. sibiricum can be infected by three endophytic fungi, Neotyphodium sibiricum (Ns), Neotyphodium gansuensis (Ng), and Epichloë gansuensis (Eg). Early studies of A. sibiricum-endophyte symbiota suggested that endophyte infection could improve the growth and stress tolerance of A. sibiricum, allowing the host grass to adapt to stressful or even extreme environmental conditions. However, few studies have examined effects of endophyte infection on allelopathic performance of A. sibiricum. In our study, we selected the natural grass Stipa grandis, a dominant species in a native community of A. sibiricum, as our research subject. The allelopathic effect of water aqueous extracts of A. sibiricum with different endophyte infection levels on seed germination and seedling growth of S. grandis was tested in petri dishes in the laboratory. GC-MS were used to identify chemical components of aqueous extracts of A. sibiricum. The results were as follows:(1) Uninfected A. sibiricum elicited the strongest inhibitory effect on the germination and seedling growth of S. grandis. Endophyte infection could alleviate allelopathic effect of A. sibiricum on the target species. (2) The allelopathic effect of A. sibiricum was related to the endophyte species. Compared with endophyte-free A. sibiricum, Eg infection significantly alleviated the allelopathic effect of A. sibiricum, whereas Ns and Ng infection tended to alleviate the allelopathic potential of the host grass, although the difference was not significant. (3) Four allelochemicals in water aqueous extracts of A. sibiricum were identified via GC-MS, including 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, phthalic acid, dibutyl phthalate, and methyl stearate. The relative difference in the amounts of these four allelochemicals may account for different allelopathic responses of A. sibiricum. (4) The allelopathic effect of the four potential allelochemicals was validated. The results showed that 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol had no significant effect on S. grandis at lower concentration, but was inhibitory at higher concentration, as compared to the control. Dibutyl phthalate showed a “low-promotion and high-inhibition effect”, whereas phthalic acid and methyl stearate showed a “dose effect” on S. grandis. Therefore, the four potential allelochemicals could inhibit seed germination and seedling growth of S. grandis at higher concentrations. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

6227,Detection of endophytic fungi in Festuca spp. by means of tissue print immunoassay,"Many wild and cultivated grasses live in mutualistic symbiosis with endophytic fungi of the genera Neotyphodium and Epichloe . These associations are of agronomic importance because endophytes may induce a range of beneficial effects for the host plant but also produce alkaloids detrimental to livestock. Conventional detection of endophytes by means of histological staining is time-consuming and not suited for large numbers of samples. Therefore, in order to simplify the detection of endophytic fungi the utility of tissue print immunoassay (TPIA) was studied and compared with the commonly used microscopic analysis. Ecotypes collected from natural grassland habitats and plants from field experiments were analyzed for endophyte infection. Both methods provided similar results. Based on stained or non-stained mycelium in tissue prints, endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) tillers and inflorescences of Festuca pratensis , F. arundinacea and F. rubra were clearly distinguishable. Prints of cross sections of tillers allow the precise localization of endophyte infection within the plant tissues. Because TPIA allows the examination of endophytes in individual branches and segments of inflorescences it is a useful method for dissemination studies.

Fusarium spp., associated with symptomatic and asymptomatic plants, may be a primary causal agent of disease, a secondary invader or an endophyte. In the present work, endophytic fungi were isolated from two populations of Zea mays (BR-105 and BR-106) and their respective inbred lines. Within different inbred lines of maize, Fusarium was found at a frequency of 0 to 100% relative to the number of total isolated fungi. The frequency with which the genus occurred was practically the same in the two field sites (around 60%). Twenty-one F. verticillioides strains were analysed using the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique, employing 10 random primers. Variability analysis of endophytic isolates via RAPD showed genome polymorphism taxa of species around 60%. Endophytic isolates were clustered by their sites of origin. RAPD analysis clustered the endophytic isolates by their maize inbred lines hosts (Mil-01 to Mil-06), whereas at site A they clustered into two major groups related to the maize gene pool (BR-105 or BR-106 population). All strains isolated from seeds collected in Site A, except strains L9 and L10, were sub-grouped according to maize inbred lines. The analysis showed a discrete sub-grouping at site B.

10404,Endophyte Isolate and Host Grass Effects on Chaetocnema pulicaria (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) Feeding,"Endophytic fungi belonging to the genus Neotyphodium, confer resistance to infected host grasses against insect pests. The effect of host species, and endophtye species and strain, on feeding and survival of the corn flea beetle, Chaetocnema pulicaria Melsheimer (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) was investigated. The grass endophyte associations included natural and artificially derived associations producing varying arrays of common endophyte-related alkaloids or alkaloid groups, peramine, lolitrem B, ergovaline, and the lolines. Preference and nonpreference tests showed that C. pulicaria feeding and survival were reduced by infection of tall fescue with the wild-type strain of N. coenophialum, the likely mechanism being antixenosis rather than antibiosis. In the preference tests, endophyte and host species effects were observed. Of the 10 different Neotyphodium strains tested in artificially derived tall fescue associations, eight strongly deterred feeding by C. pulicaria, whereas the remaining two strains had little or no effect on feeding. Infection of tall fescue with another fungal symbiont, p-endophyte, had no effect.

15015,Cloning of TB1 from Hordeum bogdanii and the effect of endophytic fungi on its expression; [布顿大麦 TB1基因的克隆及内生真菌对其表达量的影响],The tillers of the Poaceous crop plant Hordeum bogdanii develop from non-elongating internodes at the base of the stem，form adventitious roots，and can survive independently of the main stem. The yield of H. bogdanii is mainly increased by tillering，which is regulated by both endophytic fungi and genes of the host. To explore the effect of endophytic fungi on the tiller-related gene TB1 in the host plant，the TB1 gene of H. bogdanii was cloned by RT-PCR，sequenced，and then analyzed using bioinformatic methods. The transcript levels of TB1 were determined by PCR using SYBR Green fluorescent dye. These PCR analyses were conducted for H. bogdanii with endophytic fungi（E+） and without endophyte fungi（E-） growing in Wensu County，Xinjiang and Tsaidam Basin，Qinghai. The full-length coding sequence of the TB1 gene cloned from H. bogdanii was 804 bp，encoding a polypeptide consisting of 267 amino acid residues. The TB1 gene had no promoter and did not encode a polyA tail. A subcellular localization analysis predicted that TB1 localizes in the vacuole. The TB1 protein，which belongs to the TCP family，has no transmembrane domains and no signal peptide，so it is not a transmembrane protein. It was predicted to be an unstable protein. The TB1 gene of H. bogdanii showed the highest homology（96. 72%）with TB1 of Hordeum vulgare subsp. ，and was located in the same branch as TB1 from H. vulgare subsp. in the phylogenetic tree. The transcript profiles of TB1 in the roots，stems，and leaves were similar between plants growing in Wensu County and those growing in the Tsaidam Basin. Endophytic fungi significantly reduced the expression of TB1 at the base of stems（the tillering site）. These results show that endophytic fungal infection affects the expression of the host’s TB1 gene，thereby regulating tillering. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for further research on the tillering mechanism of H. bogdanii. © 2023 Editorial Office of Acta Prataculturae Sinica.

830,Rhizosphere microbiome selection by EpichloA⟪ endophytes of Festuca arundinacea,"Loline alkaloids produced by EpichloA << spp. are known to deter feeding by insect herbivores while also serving as a significant carbon source for certain epiphytic bacteria on tall fescue leaves. In this study we examined the role of loline alkaloids in attracting certain bacteria to the rhizosphere of tall fescue plants that harbor loline producing fungal endophytes. Population studies were used to compare the fitness of known loline catabolizing strains to other rhizosphere bacteria. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA fragments compared the composition of bacterial communities inhabiting the endophyte infected tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) rhizosphere to those of endophyte free fescue plants. Rhizosphere population studies demonstrated that loline catabolizing strains Burkholderia ambifaria 7R and Pseudomonas aureofaciens outcompete and suppress the growth of non-loline catabolizing strains. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA fragments showed greater percentages of certain plant growth promoting bacteria in rhizosperes seeded with B. ambifaria 7R than non-inoculated soils. Rhizospheres of endophyte infected plants showed higher species richness (Shannon diversity index = 4.03) over endophyte free rhizospheres (Shannon diversity index = 3.08) and a greater percentage of Firmicutes. The differences in microbial community composition between endophyte-infected and endophyte-free rhizospheres suggest that the presence of fungal endophytes influences microbial community structure.

4639,Antagonistic potential of bacterial endophytes and induction of systemic resistance against collar rot pathogen Sclerotium rolfsii in tomato,"A diverse pool of 310 bacterial endophytes isolated from tomato plants growing in the Indo-Gangetic plains of India was evaluated for their antagonistic potential against three soil-borne fungal pathogens causing root rot (Rhizoctonia solani), collar rot (Sclerotiurn rolfsii) and, fungal wilt (Fusariurn oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici). Preliminary screening indicated that most of the isolates could inhibit R. solani and F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici to the greater extent but failed to reduce mycelia growth of S. rolfsii by more than 50 percent. The only exceptions were 1PR7a, 2P2, and 2PR9b which were further characterized and evaluated against S. rolfsii. Molecular identification of 15 isolates based on 16s rRNA gene sequence similarity indicated the presence of three genera viz. Bacillus, Lysinibacillus, and Stenotrophomonas. In planta trial in tomato challenged with pathogen S. rolfsii in presence and absence of endophyte inoculation revealed that Bacillus sp. 2P2 showed the highest protection against S. rolfsii. These strains elicited induced systemic resistance of plant and significantly higher activity (p < 0.05) of phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and ascorbate oxidase indicating the further strengthening of cell wall barrier through lipid peroxidation, cross linking of cell walls, lignifications, suberization and other cell wall strengthening processes. It was further confirmed by confocal scanning laser micrographs of upper collar region. It was evident that the inoculation of endophyte inhibited the colonization and movement of the pathogen. In addition, endophytes upregulated the expression of three pathogenesis -related genes PR1a, PR2a, and PR3, which are responsible for production of glucanases and chitinases contributing to pathogen inhibition. Further, oxidative stress alleviation was evident from decreased superoxide accumulation and enhanced dry matter content. Results of the present study indicated suppressive potential of endophyte Bacillus sp. 2P2 against S. rolfsii which could be useful in collar rot management in the nursery as well as after transplantation.","Sahu, PK; Singh, S; Gupta, A; Singh, UB; Brahmaprakash, GP; Saxena, AK",BIOLOGICAL CONTROL,2019,10.1016/j.biocontrol.2019.104014,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985128428907859,TRUE,3,7,Medium,absence of endophyte,isolated; rrna; confocal; evaluated,and Stenotrophomonas.

14886,Effect of endophyte infection on fungal disease resistance of Leymus chinensis,"Endophytes are commonly defined as fungi that live asymptomatically within healthy plant tissue, such as leaves, stems or roots, for a part or all of their life cycle. The largest plant family hosting these endophytes is Poaceae. Studies on the grass-endophyte symbiosis indicate that endophytes can not only protect the host grass from abiotic stresses but also enhance its resistance to biotic disturbance, including herbivores, nematodes, bacteria and pathogens. However, the response of grass-endophyte symbiosis to fungal pathogens is less studied. Most previous reports on resistance of endophytes to pathogens have focused on inhibition of fungal pathogens by endophytes in vitro or by inoculation of fungal pathogens on detached leaves of the symbiont, and these studies have demonstrated that endophytes can inhibit growth of certain species of fungal pathogens to some degree. Up to now, only a few studies have centered on influence of endophyte infection on disease resistance of live plants. In this paper we used the endophyte Epichloë bromicola, which was isolated from Leymus chinensis. L. chinensis is a natural grass, widely distributed in the Inner Mongolian steppe. Three species of fungal pathogens were chosen, i.e. Curvularia lunata, Bipolaris sorokiniana and Cladosporium sp.. The experiment comprised three parts, i.e. fungal pathogens inhibition experiment by endophyte, infected detached leaves and infected intact plants experiments. The questions were: (1) whether E. bromicola could inhibit the growth of the three fungal pathogens in vitro, and (2) whether endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) plants differed in resistance to the pathogenic fungi in detached leaves and live plants of L. chinensis. The results suggested that E. bromicola significantly inhibited the growth of C. lunata, B. sorokiniana and C. sp. in vitro, but anti-fungal activities of the endophyte to different pathogenic fungi were different. The inhibition rates were 56.22, 46.93 and 45.15%, respectively. Culture filtrate of endophyte also effectively reduced pathogenic spore germination and the average germination rate were 30.4, 15.7 and 16.4%, respectively. The main antagonism mechanisms involved in competition and producing anti-fungal chemical compounds. As for our research, the main strategy was the latter. Leaf inoculation trial showed that all fungal pathogens were able to cause lesions on detached leaves regardless of endophyte status. Either the number or length of disease lesions on E+ L. chinensis leaves caused by C. lunata or C. sp. decreased compared with those on E- leaves. But lesion number and length of B. sorokiniana leaf spots were dramatically higher on E+ leaves compared with E- leaves. Detached leaves extraction inhibited three pathogens to varying degrees. The reason might be that some inhibitory substances differed in vitro and in the whole plant. The intact E+ leaves had greater resistance to all of three species of pathogens than E- leaves. The explanation may be that the defense of plant associated with endophyte increased through resistance enhancement and secondary metabolites production. In a word, the endophyte E. bromicola had a positive effect on disease resistance of the host plant. © 2014, Ecological Society of China.

956,The effect of Epichloe endophyte on phyllosphere microbes and leaf metabolites in Achnatherum inebrians,"Upon exposure to the prevailing environment, leaves become increasingly colonized by fungi and bacteria located on the surface (epiphytic) or within (endophytic) the leaves. Many cool season grasses, including Achnatherum inebrians, host aseed-borne, intercellular, mutualistic Epichloe fungal endophyte, the growth of which is synchronized with the host grass. A study utilizing illumina sequencing was used to examine the epiphytic and endophytic microbial communities in Epichloe endophyte-infected and endophyte-free A. inebrians plants growing under hot dry field conditions. The presence of Epichloe endophyte increased the Shannon and decreased Simpson diversity of bacterial and fungal communities. Sphingomonas and Hymenobacter bacteria and Filobasidium and Mycosphaerella fungi were growing largely epiphytically, whereas Methylobacterium, Escherichia-Shigella, and the fungus Blumeria were mostly found within leaves with the location of colonization influenced by the Epichloe endophyte. In addition, leaf metabolites in Epichloe-infected and Epichloe-free leaves were examined using LC/MS.

The main objectives of current research were to (i) isolate and identify cultivable fungal wheat endophytes from healthy wheat plants grown in different regions in Jordan and to (ii) verify the endophytic characteristics through conducting invitro test on seeds and testing the germination success of seeds with and without endophyte. Wheat plants were collected from different wheat growing regions in northern, middle and southern Jordan. Fungal endophytes were isolated from wheat roots and aerial organs, including leaves, stems, and spikes using the cultivable dependent approach. A total of 83 representatives of the most dominant cultivable endophytes were sequenced using the ITS4/5 gene region. All the identified isolates were belonging to phylum Ascomyctoa, sub-phylum Pezizomycotina. In Pezizomycotina, five classes, seven orders, and 12 families were recognized. Sordariomycetes accounted for the highest frequency followed by Dothidiomycetes. Fungi were most abundant in roots as compared to the other plant parts from which they were isolated. A total of 22 genera and 44 species were identified from different wheat plant parts. Chaetomium sp. was the most recovered fungus followed by Fusarium sp. and Alternaria sp. Different genera were identified from the same organ and some were identified from all plant parts. Some of the isolated fungi had been reported in previous studies as pathogenic to wheat such but according to the pathogenicity in vitro experiment, all the tested isolates except one isolate were nonpathogenic and were not significantly different in all the parameters from the control. Seven genera and two unknown fungal species are new reports as fungal endophytes in wheat. The distribution of the different fungal endophytes among the different governates showed diversity and richness for some genera and in certain locations. For example Chaetomium was found in all governates suggesting the adaptability of this fungus to wheat regardless of the location. Future work is in progress to study the effect of these endophytes on wheat agronomic traits, as biological control agents against wheat major diseases, and as aphid repellents.","Al-Khawaldeh, MM; Araj, SE; Alananbeh, KM; Al Antary, TM",FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN,2020,NA,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.950333723158338,TRUE,3,6,Medium,without endophyte,isolated; sequenced; collected; tested,NA,"collected from different wheat growing regions in northern, middle and southern Jordan.

12282,Influence of host diet on parasitoid fitness: unravelling the complexity of a temperate pastoral agroecosystem,"Parasitoid fitness is closely associated with the condition of the host insect, and the condition of the host is partly dependent on the quality and quantity of plant food available. The relationship between host diet and parasitoid fitness therefore has the potential to indirectly mediate complex multitrophic interactions. This relationship may be influenced both by the presence of mycotoxins from endophytic fungi, which share symbiotic relationships with plants and cause reductions in host-plant quality for herbivores, and by the availability of beneficial nutrient-rich plant foods such as pollen. This study used a multitrophic system involving ryegrass, a fungal endophyte, pollen, and an insect herbivore and its parasitoid to study the effect of host diet on parasitoid fitness. Previous studies showed that the larval stage of the parasitoid was negatively influenced by the presence of fungal-derived alkaloids in the diet of its host, but no assessment of effects on the adult stage of the parasitoid had been made. Similarly, the effect of pollen in the diet of the host on the fitness of the parasitoid had not previously been examined. In this study, the fitness of parasitoids reared from hosts fed endophyte-free ryegrass, endophyte-free ryegrass plus pollen, or endophyte-infected ryegrass was assessed in two laboratory experiments. Host insects exhibited significant responses to treatment, but remarkably, there were no significant treatment effects on parasitoid development times, the number of successful parasitoid emergences, tibia length, or preoviposition egg complement. The absence of a strong relationship between host diet and parasitoid fitness in this study differs markedly from studies of other parasitoid-host systems in that the adult stage of this parasitoid appears remarkably unresponsive to variation in host condition. This work contributes to a better understanding of multitrophic interactions and to the refinement of integrated pest management tactics in a temperate pastoral agroecosystem.","Urrutia, MA; Wade, MR; Phillips, CB; Wratten, SD",ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA,2007,10.1111/j.1570-7458.2007.00526.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.952704768803158,TRUE,3,6,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS; examined; examined; assessed,"not previously been examined.

13506,Endophytes in New Zealand grass seeds: Occurrence and implications for conservation of grass species,"Grass seeds from 24 native species and 3 introduced, naturalised species were collected during the summer of 1999/2000 in New Zealand, mainly from the South Island. These species represented 12 grass genera. Of the native grasses, 19 are endemic. These seeds were examined for the presence of Epichloë or Neotyphodium endophytic fungi. No endophyte was detected in any of the 64 seed collections of native species. These included seven native Poa and two native Festuca species, and contrast with the common occurrence of endophytes in Northern Hemisphere and South American populations of these genera. This may be linked to the time of colonisation of these grasses by endophytes occurring after the isolation of New Zealand from continental populations, or low herbivore pressure (vertebrate and invertebrate) in New Zealand. No endophyte was found in Elymus recticetus, a naturalised grass species introduced from Australia. However, endophyte (E. festucae) was detected in 6 of the 20 naturalised Festuca ovina and F. rubra collections, of which 4 had 82–87% endophyte-infected seed. Endophyte is known to be widespread in roadside collections of the two agricultural species Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) and Schedonorus phoenix (syn. F. arundinacea, tall fescue). Published records show that to date the only native New Zealand species known to contain endophyte is Echinopogon ovatus.

8489,Variable effects of endophytic fungus on seedling establishment of fine fescues,"Seedborne systemic endophytic fungi of grasses are thought to be plant mutualists, because they have been shown to improve their host's resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses. The interactions in plant-endophyte associations vary from mutualistic to parasitic with environmental conditions and the genotypes of interacting species. The possible pros and cons of endophytic fungi are expected to be most evident during the seedling establishment, where host fitness is most directly affected. If this holds true, endophytes may play a focal role in local adaptation of hosts to different environments. We examined if endophyte-infected and uninfected seeds and seedlings of two native grass species, Festuca rubra and F. ovina, differ in seed germination and seedling growth rates under greenhouse conditions. The germination of F. rubra seeds was also studied in the field. This is the first time that the effects of EpichloA << endophyte on seedling establishment of fine fescues from natural populations have been experimentally evaluated. Mother plant (seed family) had a marked effect on many response variables in both grass species. Length and mean biomass of tillers of endophyte-infected (E+) F. ovina seedlings were lower, but root:shoot ratios were higher than in endophyte-free (E-) seedlings. In F. rubra, the effects of the endophyte were dependent on the habitat where the seeds were collected. The E+ seeds from river banks germinated faster than E+ seeds from meadows, and E+ seedlings from the river banks produced fewer but taller and heavier tillers than the other seedlings. Our data suggest that the effects of the endophyte infection on the seedling stage of fine fescues are dependent the species of grass, host genetic background and mother plant habitat.

3525,Temperature and Plant Genotype Alter Alkaloid Concentrations in Ryegrass Infected with an Epichloe Endophyte and This Affects an Insect Herbivore,"Asexual Epichloe endophytes colonize agricultural forage grasses in a relationship which is mutually beneficial and provides the host plant with protection against herbivorous insects. The endophyte strain AR37 (Epichloe festucae var. loljj) produces epoxy-janthitrem alkaloids and is the only endophyte known to provide ryegrass with resistance against porina larvae (Wiseana cervinata (Walker)), a major pasture pest in cooler areas of New Zealand. This study examined the effect of temperature on concentrations of epoxy-janthitrems in AR37-infected ryegrass and determined how the resulting variations in concentration affected consumption, growth and survival of porina larvae. Twenty replicate pairs of perennial (Lolium perenne L.) and Italian ryegrass (L, multiflorum Lam.) plants with and without endophyte were prepared by cloning, with one of each pair grown at either high (20 degrees C) or low (7 degrees C) temperature. After 10 weeks, herbage on each plant was harvested, divided into leaf and pseudostem, then freeze dried and ground. Leaf and pseudostem material was then incorporated separately into semi-synthetic diets which were fed to porina larvae in a bioassay over 3 weeks. Epoxy-janthitrem concentrations within the plant materials and the semi -synthetic diets were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. AR37-infected ryegrass grown at high temperature contained high in planta concentrations of epoxy-janthitrem (30.6 mu g/g in leaves and 83.9 mu g/g in pseudostems) that had a strong anti-feedant effect on porina larvae when incorporated into their diets, reducing their survival by 25-42% on pseudostems. In comparison, in planta epoxy-janthitrem concentrations in AR37-infected ryegrass grown at low temperature were very low (0.67 mu g/g in leaves and 7.4 mu g/g in pseudostems) resulting in a small anti-feedant effect in perennial but not in Italian ryegrass. Although alkaloid concentrations were greatly reduced by low temperature this reduction did not occur until after 4 weeks of exposure. Alkaloid concentrations were slightly lower in Italian than in perennial ryegrass and concentrations were higher in the pseudostems when compared with the leaves.

18721,Impact of Low-Level Ergot Alkaloids and Endophyte Presence in Tall Fescue Grass on the Metabolome and Microbiome of Fall-Grazing Steers.,"Fescue toxicosis (FT) is a mycotoxin-related disease caused by the ingestion of tall fescue, naturally infected with the ergot alkaloid (EA)-producing endophyte Epichloë coenophiala. Some grazing on endophyte-free (E-) or non-toxic (NT), commercial endophyte-infected pastures takes place in the US as well. Earlier, we found that grazing on toxic fescue with low levels of EAs during fall affects thermoregulation, behavior, and weight gain. Building on these findings, the current study aimed to investigate how the presence of low EA-producing E+ or NT endophytes can influence animal metabolome, microbiome, and, ultimately, overall animal health. Eighteen Angus steers were placed on NT, E+, and E- fescue pastures for 28 days. Urine, rumen fluid (RF), rumen solid (RS), and feces were collected pre-exposure, and on days 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28. An untargeted high-resolution metabolomics approach was used to analyze urine and RF, while 16S rRNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to examine RF, RS, feces, and fescue plant microbiomes. While alpha- or beta-microbiota diversity across all analyzed matrices were unaffected, there were specific effects of E+ on the relative abundance of some taxa (i.e., Prevotellaceae). Additionally, E+ grazing impacted aromatic amino acid metabolism in the urine and the metabolism of lipids in both the RF and urine. In both matrices, trace amine-related metabolic features differed markedly between E+ and the other groups. Compared to the endophyte-free group, endophyte presence, whether novel or toxic, influenced amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, as well as unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. These findings suggest that low-EA-producing and non-toxic endophytes in fescue have more prominent effects on the metabolome than the microbiome, and this metabolome perturbation might be associated with decreased performance and reported physiological signs of FT.",Llada IM; Lourenco JM; Dycus MM; Carpenter JM; Jarrell ZR; Jones DP; Suen G; Hill NS; Filipov NM,Toxins,2025,10.3390/toxins17050251,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.956627537254223,TRUE,3,6,Medium,endophyte-free,rrna; sequencing; analyzed; collected,"tall fescue, naturally infected with the ergot alkaloid (EA)-producing endophyte Epichloë coenophiala.

Analysis of A. japonicus culture filtrate displayed higher concentrations of salicylic acid (SA), indoleacetic acid (IAA), flavonoids, and phenolics. Furthermore, A. japonicus association with soybean and sunflower had improved plant biomass and other growth features under high temperature stress (40 degrees C) in comparison to endophyte-free plants. In fact, endophytic association mitigated heat stress by negotiating the activities of abscisic acid, catalase, and ascorbic acid oxidase in both soybean and sunflower. The nutritional quality (phenolic, flavonoids, soluble sugars, proteins, and lipids) of the A. japonicus-associated seedlings has also improved under heat stress in comparison to endophyte-free plants. From the results, it is concluded that A. japonicus can modulate host plants growth under heat stress and can be used as thermal stress alleviator in arid and semiarid regions of the globe (where mean summer temperature exceeds 40 degrees C) to sustain agriculture.","Ismail; Hamayun, M; Hussain, A; Iqbal, A; Khan, SA; Lee, IJ",BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL,2018,10.1155/2018/7696831,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.968920019221435,TRUE,3,6,Medium,endophyte-free,isolated; culture; 18s,"biomass and other growth features under high temperature stress (40 degrees C) in comparison to endophyte-free plants.

7521,Endophytic Fungi as a Promising Biocontrol Agent to Protect Wheat from Fusarium graminearum Head Blight,"The search for beneficial endophytes that can be part of a constructed microbial community has increased in recent years. We characterized three endophytic fungi previously isolated from wheat for their in vitro and in planta antagonism toward the Fusarium head blight pathogen, Fusarium graminearum. The endophytes were phylogenetically characterized and shown to be Alternaria destruens, Fusarium commune, and Fusarium oxysporum. Individual fungal endophytes significantly increased seed weight and lowered the accumulation of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol compared with F. graminearum-infected wheat heads without endophyte pretreatment. Investigation into the mechanism of competition in vitro showed that endophytes competitively excluded F. graminearum by preemptive colonization and possible inhibition over a distance. Investigations on the use of these endophytes in the field are in progress. Identification of these three endophytes highlights a common quandary in searching for beneficial microbes to use in agriculture: species definitions often do not separate individual isolates' lifestyles. A greater understanding of the risks in using intraspecies variants for biocontrol is needed and should be examined in the context of the ecology of the individuals being investigated.","Noel, ZA; Roze, L; Breunig, M; Trail, F",PLANT DISEASE,2022,10.1094/PDIS-06-21-1253-RE,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.978591030372871,TRUE,3,6,Medium,without endophyte,isolated; examined; investigated; examined,weight and lowered the accumulation of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol compared with F. graminearum-infected wheat heads without endophyte pretreatment.

12462,Occurrence of the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum in leaf blades of tall fescue and implications for stock health,"Leaf blades of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) plants infected with the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium coenophialum (= Acremonium coenophialum) have often been assumed to be endophyte-free. However, fungal colonies identified as N. coenophialum developed following incubation of surface-sterilised leaf blades from endophyte-infected tall fescues on antibiotic potato dextrose agar. A standardised fungal isolation technique was developed to assess the distribution of hyphae within tall fescue leaf blades in three USA-bred cultivars ('Georgia 5', 'Kentucky 31', 'Jesup') and a roadside population (MRSP) from the Manawatu region, New Zealand. Leaf blades of the three USA-bred cultivars were typically sparsely colonised. In contrast, extensively colonised leaf blades were present in many MRSP plants, particularly in autumn. Ergovaline concentrations of up to 3.9 ppm (mean 2.5) were present in leaf blades of the MRSP grown in a glasshouse. Ergovaline at lower concentrations (mean 0.4 ppm) was also detected in leaf blades of the tall fescue cultivars infected with their natural endophytes. These unusually high concentrations of hyphae and ergovaline observed within leaf blades of the MRSP provide an explanation of why fescue toxicosis has been especially severe in New Zealand. Significantly, N. coenophialum from plants of the MRSP was not uniform in cultural characteristics and conidial length, or in the ability to colonise leaf blades and produce ergovaline in artificially infected plants of four diverse tall fescue cultivars. The four inoculated cultivars ('Georgia 5', 'Grasslands Roa', 'Kentucky 31', 'KFa949') also differed in their interaction with N, coenophialum from MRSP. The most colonised leaf blades were in plants from an experimental cultivar of Mediterranean origin (KFa949), and, surprisingly, ergovaline concentrations were higher in the leaf blades than sheath. The New Zealand-bred tall fescue cultivar 'Grasslands Roa' was also distinctive in that no hyphae were detected in leaf blades. The concentration of ergovaline present in pooled leaf blades of 'Grasslands Roa' plants was lower than in those of the other naturally and artificially infected tall fescue/N. coenophialum populationsexamined in this study, reflecting the apparently low concentrations of hyphae present.","Christensen, MJ; Easton, HS; Simpson, WR; Tapper, BA",NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,1998,10.1080/00288233.1998.9513343,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.664451786926597,TRUE,3,6,Medium,endophyte-free,isolation; agar; observed,NA,surface-sterilised leaf blades from endophyte-infected tall fescues on antibiotic potato dextrose agar.

1172,Translocation of Loline Alkaloids in Epichloe-Infected Cereal and Pasture Grasses: What the Insects Tell Us,"Aphids are major pests of cereal and pasture grasses throughout the world, vectoring disease and reducing plant production. There are few control options other than insecticides. Epichloe endophytes that produce loline alkaloids in their hosts provide a possible mechanism of control, with both meadow fescue and tall fescue naturally infected with loline-producing endophytes showing a resistance to Rhopalosiphum padi. We screened Elymus spp. naturally infected with endophytes that produced loline alkaloids at concentrations known to affect aphids on fescue but found no effect on these insects infesting Elymus. A synthetic loline-producing endophyte association with rye also had no effect on the aphids. After hypothesizing that the lolines were being translocated in the xylem in Elymus and rye rather than the phloem, we tested the rye and meadow fescue infected with loline-producing endophytes against a xylem feeding spittlebug. The endophyte in rye inhibited the feeding of the insect and reduced its survival, whereas the endophyte-infected meadow fescue had no effect on the spittlebug but reduced the number of aphids. Lolines applied to the potting medium of endophyte-free and endophyte-infected rye, ryegrass, and tall fescue resulted in a decrease in the aphid populations on the endophyte-free pasture grasses relative to the untreated controls but had no effect on aphid numbers on the rye. We tentatively conclude that lolines, produced in both natural and synthetic association with Elymus and rye, are partitioned in the xylem rather than the phloem, where they are inaccessible to aphids.","Popay, AJ; Jensen, JG; Simpson, WR; Mace, WJ; Somchit, C",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2023,10.3390/jof9010096,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990965186395518,TRUE,3,6,Medium,endophyte-free,medium; ITS; screened; tested,"the spittlebug but reduced the number of aphids.

1448,Plant-fungal symbiosis affects litter decomposition during primary succession,"Microbial symbionts of plants can affect decomposition by altering the quality or quantity of host plant tissue (substrate) or the micro-environment where decomposition occurs (conditioning). In C-3 grasses, foliar fungal endophytes (Clavicipitaceae) can increase plant resistance to drought and/or produce alkaloids that reduce herbivory - effects that may also influence host litter composition and subsequent litter decomposition. We studied the effect of the endophyte Epichloe sp. on litter decomposition in the Great Lakes dunes (USA) using a reciprocal design altering endophyte presence/absence in both American beachgrass Ammophila breviligulata substrate (litter bags) and its conditioning of the decomposition microenvironment. Symbiont treatments were crossed with rain-out shelters that altered growing season precipitation. The first year of decomposition, senesced leaf substrate from A. breviligulata with Epichloe decomposed 21% faster than endophyte-free substrate. By the third year, conditioning by live symbiotic plants reduced cumulative decomposition by 33% compared to plots planted with endophyte-free plants. Of the traits we examined - litter quantity, C:N ratio, mineral composition, fungal colonization, and carbon chemistry - increased litter quantity via greater tiller production was the primary trait shift associated with endophyte symbiosis. Epichloe in A. breviligulata litter also altered litter nitrogen decomposition dynamics, as evidenced by lower nitrogen and protein content in decomposed tissue from plants that hosted the endophyte. Differences in initial litter quality and subsequent colonization by saprotrophic fungi were ruled out as key drivers. Altered precipitation had negligible effects on decomposing processes in the dunes. Grass-Epichloe symbiosis altered nutrient cycling through increasing the rate of litter decomposition when present in the litter and through reducing litter decomposition by conditioning the decomposition microenvironment. Epichloe are widespread symbionts of grasses. Thus, their effects on decomposition could be an important, but often overlooked, driver of nutrient cycling in grass-dominated ecosystems.","Bell-Dereske, L; Gao, XD; Masiello, CA; Sinsabaugh, RL; Emery, SM; Rudgers, JA",OIKOS,2017,10.1111/oik.03648,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995950144875306,TRUE,3,6,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS; examined; examined; studied,"year of decomposition, senesced leaf substrate from A. breviligulata with Epichloe decomposed 21% faster than endophyte-free substrate.

20900,Photosynthetic pigments and photosynthetic products of endophyte-infection and endophyte-free Lolium perenne L. under drought stress conditions,"Endophytes and their host grasses are mutually symbiotic. On one hand, the grasses provide photosynthates for the fungi; on the other hand, the endophytes may enhance the host's growth and protect the host from biotic stresses (such as mammalian, insect, and nematode herbivores) and abiotic stresses (such as drought and high temperature). In the past, much research work has been done on the beneficial effect of endophyte infection on biotic stress resistance of grasses. When abiotic stress, such as drought, was regarded, most research work focused on several agronomy indexes. Thus, in this paper Lolium perenne cv SR4000 infected by Neotyphodium lolii was chosen as experimental material. Relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll, soluble sugar and starch content of endophyte-infected (EI) and endophyte-free (EF) populations under normal and drought stress conditions were compared. EI seeds of Lolium perenne L. were used to attain EF population by heating the seeds at 43′C for 15 min and then 57′C for 25min. The experimental seedling was bred in winter during 1998, and then populations were constructed twice with ramets in April 1999 and April 2000 separately. EI and EF populations were transplanted into the soil column system designed for the experiment. Each system was comprised of a cylinder-shaped tinplate sleeve filled with soil and fixed in the ground. The : REN An-Zhi, Ph. D., Associate professor, System was 25cm in diameter and 60cm in depth. The top 0-25cm layer was filled with a compound of soil, sand and biological fertilizer (soil: sand: biological fertilizer = 18: 10: 1). Each column contained approximately 14.3kg oven-dried soil. Field capacity and permanent wilting point were 18.53% and 8.31% respectively. Eighteen column systems were made as required. The experimental populations were treated by cyclic drought stress where three stress levels were designed, i.e. control, mild and moderate level. The stress treatment period was from Sep. 29, 2000 to Nov. 7, 2000, and sustained for 40 days. In this period, the control set was watered once per six days; the mild stress set was watered on the 10 th, 25th and 40th day, respectively; and the moderate stress set was watered only once at the end of the period. When watered, all populations were watered to field capacity. When the stress period ended, the shoots were harvested, leaving a stubble height of about 4cm. The remaining plant parts lived through the winter in their natural condition. During the next spring, the regeneration characters of each population were investigated. A newly expanded leaf, or the second leaf down which had recently fully expanded, was taken for the determination of relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll, soluble sugar and starch content. The leaf samples were taken between 2:00 and 2:30 pm. The sampling work was carried out at three-day intervals. The results showed that RWC of EI leaves were close to that of EF leaves under controlled and mild stress, while under moderate stress, RWC of EI leaves was significantly higher than that of EF leaves, i.e. EI plants took more advantage over EF plants in water-holding ability. When carbohydrate accumulation was regarded, the endophyte could enhance soluble sugars in host plants to improve their osmotic ability under mild stress. With stress intensification, the improvement of the endophyte no longer existed, but at this time more photosynthetic products (such as starch) accumulated in EI plants, which could be beneficial for the host grass to survive through the undesirable conditions, such as winter. During the next spring, EI populations recovered more rapidly than EF populations. Especially after moderate drought stress treatment, EI populations had significantly more regeneration tillers than EF populations. The biomass of a population is closely related to its photosynthesis. Under moderate stress, EI populations accumulated significantly more biomass than EF populations, which suggests that endophyte infection could alleviate photosynthesis inhibition of drought stress on ryegrass. As far as photosynthesis pigments were concerned, contents of Chla, Chlb and Car of EI plants were close to those of EF plants, which showed that endophyte infection didn't protect photosynthesis pigments from being destroyed by drought stress, and the endophyte may improve photosynthesis ability of its host plant in other ways.",Ren A.-Z.; Gao Y.-B.; Wang W.; Wang J.-L.,Acta Ecologica Sinica,2005,NA,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.911976018292906,TRUE,3,5,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS; fixed; investigated,"material.

14709,Influence of tall fescue endophyte infection on structural stability as quantified by high energy moisture characteristic in a range of soils,"Plant microbial symbionts could play a significant role on aggregate stability, an important index for soil physical quality. So far there is little information available linking the presence of endophyte in the aboveground parts of plants, with aggregate stability of rhizosphere soil. We hypothesized that the presence of Epichloë coenophiala in the aboveground parts of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.=Schedonorus arundinaceus and Lolium arundinaceum) may alter the structural properties of rhizospheric soil. A greenhouse pot experiment was performed to evaluate the evidence for a relationship between endophyte-tall fescue symbiosis and rhizosphere aggregate stability for a range of soils. Traditional methods for measuring aggregate stability would not be able to distinguish the impacts of these biotic factors because they usually rely on rapid immersion of aggregates in water which is very disruptive. In this study, the aggregate stability was quantified by high energy moisture characteristic (HEMC) because HEMC is capable to accurately characterize small differences in aggregate stability among the treatments and soils. Clonally propagated tillers of tall fescue (genotype 75C) naturally infected with E. coenophiala (E+) and endophyte-free ones (E-) were used. Plants were grown under optimal water, light and temperature conditions. After eight months, when plants reached the maximum vegetative growth, intact soil aggregates adherent to plant roots (i.e. rhizosphere soil) and those free of root (i.e. bulk soil) were collected for HEMC determination. The HEMCs of slow and fast wetted aggregates were determined at high matric suctions of 0 to 50hPa. HEMC data was modeled using a modified van Genuchten function. Then, various indices including volume of drainable pores (VDP), relative VDP (RVDP), VDP ratio (VDPR), modal suction (hmodal), relative hmodal (Rhmodal), stability index (SI), relative SI (RSI), stability ratio (SR), relative SR (RSR), slope at the inflection point (Si), and inflection point slope ratio (SiR) were derived to characterize soil structural stability. Endophyte presence was correlated with increased soil organic carbon (SOC) pools especially for the fine-textured soils. Changes in the SOC storage of rhizosphere soil altered the structural stability and increased the SR. The effect of endophyte infection on SR of the rhizosphere soil was also more evident in medium- and fine-textured soils due to physical protection of SOC. Lower values of hmodal and higher values of VDP of fast wetted aggregates revealed more stable macropores and greater aggregate stability in the E+ rhizosphere soil vs. E- one. VDPR, SR and SiR values of rhizosphere soil were greater in E+ plants associated soils. Fine-textured soils had lower values of SiR because of their greater values of Si in the slow wetting treatment. Plant root presence could improve the soil structure compared to the bulk soil due to exudation of cementing materials; values greater than 1 for RVDP, RSI and RSR indicate that plant root enhanced the structural stability of rhizosphere soil. In contrast to stability ratio, the effects of Epichloë endophyte-tall fescue symbiosis on relative structural stability indices such as RVDP, Rhmodal, RSI, and RSR were more pronounced in coarse- and medium-textured soils.

Fetal growth, muscle fiber development, and miRNA transcriptome1.","The objective of this study was to assess how exposure to ergot alkaloids during 2 stages of gestation alters fetal growth, muscle fiber formation, and miRNA expression. Pregnant ewes (n = 36; BW = 83.26 ± 8.14 kg; 4/group; 9 groups) were used in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with 2 tall fescue seed treatments [endophyte-infected (E+) vs. endophyte-free (E-)] fed during 2 stages of gestation (MID, days 35 to 85 vs. LATE, days 86 to 133), which created 4 possible treatments (E-/E-, E+/E-, E-/E+, or E+/E+). Ewes were individually fed a total mixed ration containing E+ or E- fescue seed according to treatment assignment. Terminal surgeries were conducted on day 133 of gestation for the collection of fetal measurements and muscle samples. Data were analyzed as a 2 × 2 factorial with fescue treatment, stage of gestation, and 2-way interaction as fixed effects. Fetuses exposed to E+ seed during LATE gestation had reduced (P = 0.0020) fetal BW by 10% compared with E- fetuses; however, fetal body weight did not differ (P = 0.41) with E+ exposure during MID gestation. Fetuses from ewes fed E+ seed during MID and LATE gestation tended to have smaller (P = 0.058) kidney weights compared with E- fetuses. Liver weight was larger (P = 0.0069) in fetuses fed E- during LATE gestation compared with E+. Fetal brain weight did not differ by fescue treatment fed during MID (P = 0.36) or LATE (P = 0.40) gestation. The percentage of brain to empty body weight (EBW) was greater (P = 0.0048) in fetuses from ewes fed E+ fescue seed during LATE gestation, which is indicative of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Primary muscle fiber number was lower (P = 0.0005) in semitendinosus (STN) of fetuses exposed to E+ during MID and/or LATE gestation compared with E-/E-. miRNA sequencing showed differential expression (P < 0.010) of 6 novel miRNAs including bta-miR-652_R+1, mdo-miR-22-3p, bta-miR-1277_R-1, ppy-miR-133a_L+1_1ss5TG, hsa-miR-129-1-3p, and ssc-miR-615 in fetal STN muscle. These miRNA are associated with glucose transport, insulin signaling, intracellular ATP, hypertension, or adipogenesis. This work supports the hypothesis that E+ tall fescue seed fed during late gestation reduces fetal weight and causes asymmetrical growth, which is indicative of IUGR.

11338,Effects of Methyl Jasmonate and an Endophytic Fungus on Plant Resistance to Insect Herbivores,"Tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) forms a mutualistic relationship with the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum. The endophyte provides constitutive resistance to herbivores through its production of alkaloid compounds. Moreover, herbivore attack induces elevated synthesis of loline alkaloids, that is, the fungus also provides wound-inducible resistance for its host. Jasmonic acid and its conjugates are key signaling compounds in many plant species and play a role systemically in the upregulation of defensive compounds within plants following attack by herbivores. The purpose of our study was to determine if and how the plant and fungus respond to methyl jasmonate (MJ) exposure and if these responses interact in antagonistic or synergistic ways. Plants were exposed to MJ via gaseous diffusion within a controlled environment chamber. Response to MJ was assessed with an herbivore bioassay, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to quantify alkaloids, and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to quantify mRNA from a loline alkaloid biosynthesis gene. We found that MJ hindered endophyte-infected tall fescue's resistance against aphids by downregulating transcription of the LolC gene. The opposite pattern was observed for endophyte-free tall fescue; its exposure to MJ resulted in a significant increase in resistance to aphids, apparently through stimulating defense compounds produced by the plant. These results indicate that, when tall fescue lacks fungal infection, MJ induces the plant to produce its own defensive compounds.

17309,Dietary exposure to ergot alkaloids decreases contractility of bovine mesenteric vasculature.,"Ergot alkaloids are hypothesized to cause vasoconstriction in the midgut, and prior exposure may affect the vasoactivity of these compounds. The objectives of this study were to profile vasoactivity of ergot alkaloids in bovine mesenteric artery (MA) and vein (MV) and determine if previous exposure to endophyte-infected tall fescue seed affected vasoactivity of ergocryptine (ERP), ergotamine (ERT), ergocristine (ERS), ergocornine (ERO), ergonovine (ERN), lysergic acid (LSA), ergovaline-containing tall fescue seed extract (EXT), and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT; serotonin). Ruminally cannulated Angus steers (n = 12; BW = 547 ± 31 kg) were paired by weight and randomly assigned to 6 blocks. Steers were ruminally dosed daily with 1 kg of either endophyte-infected (E+; 4.45 mg ergovaline/kg DM) or endophyte-free (E-; 0 mg ergovaline/kg DM) tall fescue seed for 21 d before slaughter. Branches of MA and MV supporting the cranial portion of the ileum were collected after slaughter on d 22, placed in a modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer on ice, cleaned, sectioned, and mounted in a multimyograph chamber. Contractile response was normalized to a maximum KCl response. Inner diameter (P = 0.04) and outer diameter (P = 0.02) of MA were smaller for E+ steers than E- steers. Maximum contractile responses to 120 mM KCl were not different between seed treatments in MA (P = 0.33; E-: 2.67 ± 0.43 g; E+: 3.33 ± 0.43 g) or MV (P = 0.26; E-: 2.01 ± 0.18 g; E+: 1.81 ± 0.18 g). Steers receiving E+ had a smaller (P < 0.01) MA contractile response than E- steers to ERP, ERT, ERS, ERO, ERN, EXT, and 5HT. Steers receiving E+ had a smaller (P < 0.05) MV contractile response than E- steers to ERP, ERT, ERS, ERN, EXT, and 5HT. Lysergic acid failed to induce a contractile response in MA and MV. The contractile response in MA and MV of E- steers produced by 5HT was very large. The EXT was the most potent (P < 0.05) agonist in MV and MA of E+ steers. These data showed that ergot alkaloids were vasoactive in the bovine midgut, and steers exposed to E+ had diminished contractility to some ergot alkaloids in small intestinal vasculature.

The objective was to determine whether a thermal or heat-tolerant Bos taurus breed of cattle, Romosinuano (RO), would tolerate EI TF toxins relative to Angus (AN) cattle. Milk production and quality were examined on AN and RO cows grazing endophyte-free (EF; variety K-31; n = 36) or EI TF (variety K-31; n = 37) along with growth of their Charolais-sired calves in 2007 and 2008 in west central Arkansas. Cows calved between early February and late March (spring). Milk yield and quality, BW, rectal temperature, and serum prolactin were determined at 57.1 +/- 2.6 d postpartum and every 28 d thereafter between April and August. Milk yield was greater in AN compared with RO cows (P < 0.001), but not influenced by forage type (P > 0.88). Percent milk fat was greater in cows grazing EF TF in April, but greater for cows grazing EI TF in July (forage x month, P < 0.001). Percent milk fat was greater for RO than AN cows (P < 0.001). Percent milk protein (P < 0.001) was greater and somatic cell counts (log-transformed; P < 0.001) were less in RO than AN cows. Milk lactose was greater for RO compared with AN cows in June through August (breed x month, P = 0.004). Adjusted weaning BW of calves was similar between EF and EI TF in 2007, but greater for calves from EF than EI TF in 2008 (forage x year, P = 0.03). Rectal temperature was similar between RO cows grazing EF and EI TF, but greater in AN cows grazing EI compared with EF TF in most months (forage x breed x month x year, P < 0.001). Serum prolactin was reduced in both breeds of cows grazing EI TF between April and July of both years and greatest in RO cows grazing EF TF (breed, P < 0.001; forage x month, P < 0.001). These data suggest that RO cows were more thermal-tolerant, but still susceptible to toxins in EI TF as shown by a reduction in serum concentrations of prolactin.

A number of favourable characteristics of tall fescue are enhanced by its seed-transmissible fungal symbiont (endophyte) Epichloe coenophiala. Our approach was to assemble the tall fescue transcriptome, then identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for endophyte-symbiotic (E+) vs endophyte-free (E-) clones in leaf blades, pseudostems, crowns and roots.

2399,Symbiotic fungal endophyte Phomopsis liquidambari-rice system promotes nitrogen transformation by influencing below-ground straw decomposition in paddy soil,"Aims To explore if and how symbiotic Phomopsis liquidambari-rice system influences below-ground straw decomposition and then nitrogen(N) transformation in response to environmental N levels. Methods and Results Litter bag experiments were utilized to trace the decay process during rice growth phases (seedling (T1), tillering (T2), heading (T3) and maturing (T4) stage), with (E+) and without endophyte (E-), under low (LN), medium (MN) and high nitrogen (HN) supply. Litter, soil and plant samples were collected to evaluate the decay process, N transformations, plant quality and relative abundance of soil ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and P. liquidambari. The results showed that straw decomposition increased by 19 center dot 76% (LN, T2 stage), 14 center dot 05% (MN, T3 stage) and 16 center dot 88% (MN, T4 stage) in E+ pots when compared with E- pots. Further analysis revealed that no significant endophyte x N interaction was found for straw decay rate and that the decay rate was reduced by a higher N supply (LN, 37 center dot 16 +/- 0 center dot 65%; MN, 32 center dot 27 +/- 1 center dot 72%; HN, 29 center dot 44 +/- 1 center dot 22%) at the T1 stage, whereas straw decay rate and N release increased by 9 center dot 38 and 11 center dot 16%, respectively, mainly by endophyte colonization at the T4 stage. The abundance of AOA and AOB were altered, corresponding with the decay rate. Soil mineral N, straw mineral N and plant quality were shown to increase in E+ pots, depending on environmental N conditions and growth phase. The yield increased by 2 center dot 98% for E+ plants under MN level. Conclusions Symbiotic P. liquidambari-rice system promoted below-ground straw decomposition and N transformation, depending on environmental N levels and plant growth phase.

2411,Effects of endophyte-infected and non-infected tall fescue residues on aggregate stability in four texturally different soils,"Fungal endophyte (Epichloe coenophiala) usually infects cool-season perennial forage grasses and enhances host plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and, by potentially altering the litter quality and decomposition rate, can affect soil properties. Aggregate stability, as an important determinant of plant root growth and soil quality, may be affected by the endophyte status of plant residues. In this study, the effects of endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) tall fescue residues (0%, 1% and 2%) on soil organic carbon (SOC), basal soil respiration (BSR) and aggregate stability were investigated in four texturally different soils in the laboratory. The aggregate stability indices were determined by the high energy moisture characteristic (HEMC) method. Moist soil samples were thoroughly mixed with either E+ or E- tall fescue residues before being incubated at 25 degrees C. During the 2-month incubation period, the amended soil samples were subjected to ten wetting and drying cycles, after which soil properties were measured. The results indicated that SOC and aggregate stability were higher and that BSR was lower in the finer-textured soils. Furthermore, an increase in the application rate of plant residues significantly increased SOC, BSR and aggregate stability. Treating the soils with E+ tall fescue residues increased SOC and aggregate stability (i.e., stability ratio, SR, a dimensionless index defined as the ratio of the structural index for the fast wetting to the structural index for the slow wetting), and significantly decreased BSR due to the toxic effects of phenolic compounds on soil microbial communities and changes in the litter chemical quality. The interactive effect of soil type and endophyte status on the SOC and BSR values was significant but no clear trend was observed. Our findings indicated that tall fescue residues (especially E+ ones) can improve soil physical quality due to increased SOC storage and greater aggregate stability. Therefore, these plants have great potential for use in grassland reclamation and soil conservation plans in semi-arid pasture and agricultural lands. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

1964,Influence of endophyte (Neotyphodium lolii) infection of perennial ryegrass on susceptibility of the black cutworm (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) to a baculovirus,"Plant secondary chemicals can alter herbivores' susceptibility to pathogens by weakening the host, by affecting exposure through feeding, or by synergizing or deactivating pathogenic microbes in the gut. This study examined how feeding on perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) with (E+) or without (E-) its alkaloid-producing fungal endophyte, Neotyphodium lolii, affects susceptibility of a grass-feeding caterpillar to a baculovirus. In separate experiments, black cutworms (Agrotis ipsilon) were reared on E+ or E- grass that had been sprayed with different rates of A. ipsilon multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AgipMNPV), or were droplet-fed a single dose of the virus while developing on those grasses. Larvae grew more quickly on E- than on E+ grass, and mortality from virus increased at higher doses, but there was no endophyte x virus interaction in either trial. Despite larger size, larvae that fed ad libitum on virus-sprayed E- grass died more quickly than counterparts feeding on virus-sprayed E+ ryegrass, but such an effect was not seen when the virus was consumed as a single dose. Together, the results suggest that feeding on E+ grass neither compromises nor synergizes infectivity of AgipMNPV in the A. ipsilon midgut. Reduced consumption or avoidance of less-palatable E+ grass could, however, decrease ingestion of virus and rates of subsequent mortality in the field. Net benefits of integrating endophytic grasses and baculoviruses for managing A. ipsilon may depend on the extent to which reduced intake of virus on E+ grass is counterbalanced by slower growth and increased mortality from other natural enemies.

12409,Tall Fescue and E. coenophiala Genetics Influence Root-Associated Soil Fungi in a Temperate Grassland,"A constitutive, host-specific symbiosis exists between the aboveground fungal endophyte Epichloe coenophiala (Morgan-Jones & W. Gams) and the cool-season grass tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh.), which is a common forage grass in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and temperate European grasslands. New cultivars of tall fescue are continually developed to improve pasture productivity and animal health by manipulating both grass and E. coenophiala genetics, yet how these selected grass-endophyte combinations impact other microbial symbionts such as mycorrhizal and dark septate fungi remains unclear. Without better characterizing how genetically distinct grass-endophyte combinations interact with belowground microorganisms, we cannot determine how adoption of new E. coenophiala-symbiotic cultivars in pasture systems will influence long-term soil characteristics and ecosystem function. Here, we examined how E. coenophiala presence and host x endophyte genetic combinations control root colonization by belowground symbiotic fungi and associated plant nutrient concentrations and soil properties in a 2-year manipulative field experiment. We used four vegetative clone pairs of tall fescue that consisted of one endophyte-free (E-) and one E. coenophiala-symbiotic (E+) clone each, where E+ clones within each pair contained one of four endophyte genotypes: CTE14, CTE45, NTE16, or NTE19. After 2 years of growth in field plots, we measured root colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE), extraradical AMF hyphae in soil, total C, N, and P in root and shoot samples, as well as C and N in associated soils. Although we observed no effects of E. coenophiala presence or symbiotic genotype on total AMF or DSE colonization rates in roots, different grass-endophyte combinations altered AMF arbuscule presence and extraradical hyphal length in soil. The CTE45 genotype hosted the fewest AMF arbuscules regardless of endophyte presence, and E+ clones within NTE19 supported significantly greater soil extraradical hyphae compared to E- clones.

Previous studies revealed a core fungal endobiome in Ulmus minor which has been suggested to play a critical role in plant functioning. Here, we hypothesized that these core endophytes are involved in abiotic stress tolerance. To test this hypothesis, two core endophytes (Cystobasidiales and Chaetothyriales) were inoculated into in vitro U. minor plantlets, which were further subjected to drought. Given that elm genotypes resistant to Dutch elm disease (DED) tend to show higher abiotic stress tolerance than susceptible ones, we tested the endophyte effect on two DED-resistant and two DED-susceptible genotypes. Drought stress was moderate; endophyte presence attenuated stomata closure in response to drought in one genotype but this stress did not affect plant survival. In comparison, long-term in-vitro culture proved stressful to mock-inoculated plants, especially in DED-susceptible genotypes. Interestingly, no endophyte-inoculated plant died during the experiment, as compared to high mortality in mock-inoculated plants. In surviving plants, endophyte presence stimulated root and shoot growth, photosynthetic rates, antioxidant activity and molecular changes involving auxinsignaling.

12854,Fungal endophyte infection increases carbon sequestration potential of southeastern USA tall fescue stands,"Tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceous (Schreb.)) is often infected with a common toxic fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum) capable of producing alkaloids that affect grazing animal health, insect herbivory, plant production, and litter decomposition. The strength of these endophyte-associated effects is thought to depend on the abiotic and biotic conditions of a specific site. Prior work from Georgia, USA, has demonstrated that fungal endophyte infection can increase soil carbon pools of tall fescue pastures: however, for endophyte infection to contribute substantially to regional carbon sequestration, this result would have to hold true across the broad range of environmental conditions that support tall fescue growth. In this study, we evaluated whether endophyte infection consistently alters various soil parameters, including carbon storage, of tall fescue stands located throughout the southeastern United States. Soil samples were collected from nine sites with established paired high- and low- endophyte-infected tall fescue stands. These samples were analyzed for basic soil parameters, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (TN), particulate and non-particulate organic matter-C and -N (POM, n-POM), C and N mineralization rates, and microbial biomass and community composition. Averaged across all sites, endophyte-infected tall fescue stands had 6% greater SOC and 5% greater TN pools in surface soil than adjacent endophyte-free stands. The lack of a significant interaction between site and endophyte infection status indicated that this result was relatively consistent across sites, despite differences in stand age, climate, and other environmental conditions. While POM C and POM N tended to be higher in endophyte-infected than endophyte-free stands, this result was not significant. However, greater pools of n-POM C and N were observed in endophyte-infected vs. endophyte-free stands when averaged across all the sites, suggesting increased retention of recalcitrant substrates occurred in response to fungal endophyte infection. Total microbial biomass, measured via phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, was greater in endophyte-infected than endophyte-free soils when averaged across sites, reflecting the trends observed with SOC and TN. Microbial community composition shifted somewhat in response to fungal endophyte infection: significantly higher fungal to bacterial ratios were observed in endophyte-free compared to endophyteinfected stands. However, ordinations of the PLFA data demonstrated only slight separation of endophyte-infected and endophyte-free microbial communities at some sites and no clear separation at others. Enhanced SOC. TN, recalcitrant n-POM C and N pools, and altered microbial biomass and communities suggest that this aboveground fungal endophyte symbiosis has widespread effects on soil biology and biochemistry, and that high prevalence of the aboveground endophyte increases C sequestration capacity of tall fescue stands throughout the southeastern USA.

15534,Creation of novel barley germplasm using an Epichloë endophyte; [利用禾草内生真菌创制大麦新种质],"Plant-endophyte associations play important roles in grassland agricultural ecology. Many studies indicate that endophytic fungi can promote host growth and reduce the biotic and abiotic stresses of host plants. Epichloë endophytes of the family Clavicitaceae are fungal symbionts of Pooideae grasses. These endophytes usually do not express any obvious host symptoms. Many Epichloë endophytes can endow hosts with increased abiotic stress tolerance as a result of enhanced growth, tillering, reproduction and nutrient acquisition, particularly under conditions of drought, cold, salt and nutrient deficiencies and thus, have important roles in pastoral agricultural systems. Animal-safe grass-endophyte associations that confer bio-protective properties for increased pasture persistence and productivity have been developed and commercialized. Artificial inoculation with symbiotic Epichloë microbes is an important technique for the creation of novel germplasm. Selected Epichloë strains can add value to some grass-based forage systems by providing both biotic and abiotic stress resistance. In addition, they can improve and strengthen grass physiological functions and plant vigor. The Epichloë bromicola WBE1 endophyte of Hordeum brevisubulatum played an important role in maintaining the growth of host grass by promoting nutrient absorption and maintaining the ionic balance under salt stress. E. bromicola WBE1 can produce peramine, an alkaloid produced by Epichloë species, that protects host grasses from herbivorous insects. However, this strain was unable to synthesize the alkaloids that are toxic to livestock, such as ergine, ergonovine, ergovaline or lolitrem B. Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is one of the most important cereal crops. The importance of barley to human and animal nutrition, and indeed to the foundation and maintenance of human civilization, is well documented. Traditional barley breeding for improved environmental stress tolerance has resulted in good varieties. However, conventional breeding techniques neglect the microorganisms in plants. In this study, animal-safe endophytic E. bromicola WBE1 isolated from wild barley (H. brevisubulatum) was artificially inoculated into cultivated hulled barley (H. vulgare cv. Yangsimai No. 1) and hull-less barley (H. vulgare var. nudum cv. Chaiqing No. 1), creating novel barley germplasm. Plants that were inoculated with endophytes and those that were free of endophytes were evaluated for growth in the field. The plant height, tiller numbers, biomass and the grain weight per plant of endophyte-inoculated hulled barley plants (Yangsimai No. 1) were 5%, 20%, 46% and 22% higher than those of the control hulled barley plants, respectively, and they matured about 5 days earlier. The tiller numbers, biomass and grain weight per plant of endophyte-inoculated hull-less barley plants (Chaiqing No. 1) were 29%, 37% and 28% higher, respectively, than those of the control hull-less barley plants in the field. However, there was no significant difference between inoculated hull-less barley plants and control hullless barley plants in the plant height and growth period. A novel germplasm of barley containing the endophyte was successfully created. E. bromicola improves plant characteristics and the growth of host. The results presented here provide evidence that the inoculation of barley with E. bromicola may be used to improve its germplasm. E. bromicola can be successfully inoculated into other phylogenetically close host species, and this technique has the potential to improve the growth of Hordeae cereal crops and serve as a broad application to produce agriculturally useful synthetic novel symbioses in germplasm. © 2021, Science Press.

Mean frequencies of infection of three cultivars remained lower than 0.10, and two of the cultivars, Kasper and Salten, were intermediately infected. In most of the cultivars, frequencies of infection varied only slightly among seed lots. In cultivar Kasper, however, the frequency of endophyte infection was highly variable (0-0.96) among the 45 seed lots examined. The relative importance of cultivar, seed lot and infection by Neotyphodium endophyte to the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi L. was studied experimentally, using both endophyte-free and endophyte-infected plants of four seed lots of the two intermediately infected cultivars. Endophyte infection increased plant resistance to R. padi, overriding the influences of seed lot and cultivar.

12355,Response of Pratylenchus spp. in tall fescue infected with different strains of the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum,"The presence of the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) confers resistance to some plant-parasitic nematodes but also results in the production of ergot alkaloids. Recently, new strains of N. coenophialum have been isolated from wild tall fescue and artificially inoculated into elite tall fescue cultivars. These strains produce low to nil levels of ergot alkaloids and are referred to as non-ergot strains. Our objective was to determine whether non-ergot strains of the endophyte confer the same level of resistance to Pratylenchus spp. as the endemic strain in tall fescue. In a glasshouse experiment, nematode resistance was compared in two fescue cultivars (Jesup and Georgia 5) infected with either the endemic strain (E(+)), or two non-ergot strains, AR542 and AR584. An additional non-ergot strain, AR514, was tested only in cv. Jesup. Cultivars Georgia 5 and Jesup without endophytes (E(-)) were used as controls. The endophtye status of the plants was confirmed and then three plants per cultivar/endophyte combination were transplanted into 10 cm square pots. The pots were inoculated with a mixed culture of Pratylenchus zeae and P. scribneri in the first trial and a pure culture of P. scribneri in the second trial of the experiment. After 8 weeks, the number of nematodes within the roots from each pot was determined. Numbers of Pratylenchus spp. in either cv. Georgia 5 or cv. Jesup containing the non-ergot strain AR542 were not different from numbers in E- plants. AR514 also did not confer resistance to the nematodes in cv. Jesup. By contrast, the non-ergot strain AR584 appears to confer resistance to Pratylenchus spp. in cv. Georgia 5, but not in cv. Jesup; however, the level of resistance in cv. Georgia 5 was less than the resistance conferred by the endemic endophyte. Genetic differences between the two tall fescue cultivars may affect growth of the endophyte or production of a nematode toxin or deterrent by the endophyte.

12208,Host-endophyte (Epichloë occultans) interaction impacts on annual ryegrasses (Lolium persicum and Lolium rigidum): ecological and breeding implications,"Main conclusionGrass endophytic symbionts interact with the host depending on the host's genetic background and environmental pressures, aiming for survival. Lolium persicum, a self-pollinating annual grass, is suggested for studying such an interaction.AbstractMost grasses host endophytic fungi, co-evolved organisms that can interact with their hosts from antagonism to mutualism. This study examined the impact of mating systems on host-endophyte interactions by utilizing endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) populations of self-pollinating Lolium persicum and open-pollinating Lolium rigidum, collected from three regions of Iran. The evaluations in a pre-breeding process and two experiments were conducted on 1400 plants screened to select 126 half-sib (L. rigidum) and full-sib (L. persicum) families based on a limited space stress, morphological traits, and seed dormancy, respectively. It was found that endophytes generally have a significant and positive effect on reproductive traits and promoting effects in plants to strive for survival. Their impacts were population-dependent, and the E+ plants were superior when a population had higher biomass production and seed yield-related traits. Endophytes help to maintain the host's genetic structure over generations, particularly in L. persicum. In this way, E+ populations exhibited the highest heritability and genetic advance for endophyte-host survival traits such as seed weight, number of seeds, plant height, and days to tillering in both species. In L. persicum, this also included acid-detergent fiber, neutral detergent fiber, crude protein, fat content, phosphorus content, number of tillers, and days to emergence. We demonstrated that artificial selection of morphological traits influenced plant-fungal fitness, such that selecting against seed dormancy significantly increased seed shattering but decreased fungal fitness.","Torkian, M; Sabzalian, MR; Mirlohi, A; Schardl, CL; Volaire, F",PLANTA,2025,10.1007/s00425-025-04684-3,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.838623175448515,TRUE,3,5,Medium,endophyte-free,examined; examined; screened; collected,"study examined the impact of mating systems on host-endophyte interactions by utilizing endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) populations of self-pollinating Lolium persicum and open-pollinating Lolium rigidum, collected from three regions of","fungi, co-evolved organisms that can interact with their hosts from antagonism to mutualism.

2519,Effects of Tall Fescue and Its Fungal Endophyte on the Development and Survival of Tawny-Edged Skippers (Lepidoptera: Hesperiidae),"Invasive, exotic grasses are increasing in tallgrass prairie and their dominance may be contributing to the decline of grassland butterflies through alterations in forage quality. Tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.) Dumort.), an exotic grass covering millions of acres in the United States, can host a fungal endophyte, Epichloe coenophiala (Morgan-Jones & Gams). Alkaloids produced by the endophyte are known to be toxic to some foliar-feeding pest insects. Endophyte-infected tall fescue is commonly planted in hayfields, pastures, lawns, and is invading natural areas, but effects of the endophyte on nonpest insects such as butterflies are relatively unknown. Our objective was to investigate the role that tall fescue and its endophyte might play in the decline of grass skippers (Hesperiidae). We examined growth and survival parameters of tawny-edged skippers (Polites themistocles (Latreille)) that were reared on endophyte-infected tall fescue (E+), endophyte-free tall fescue (E-), and Kentucky bluegrass (KBG). KBG was included as a comparison because it is a cool season grass known to be palatable to P. themistocles larvae. Interestingly, results showed that the endophyte did not affect growth and survival of larvae compared to uninfected tall fescue, even though significant amounts of loline alkaloids (average 740 ppm) were measured in endophyte-infected plant material. Larvae feeding on KBG grew faster with greater survival rates than larvae on both tall fescue treatments. These results confirm that tall fescue invasion and dominance may be deteriorating the quality of grassland habitats for native pollinators; however, this effect does not appear to be linked to endophyte infection.","Jokela, KJ; Debinski, DM; Mcculley, RL",ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,2016,10.1093/ee/nvv151,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.95241360568557,TRUE,3,5,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS; examined; examined,"parameters of tawny-edged skippers (Polites themistocles (Latreille)) that were reared on endophyte-infected tall fescue (E+), endophyte-free tall fescue (E-), and Kentucky bluegrass (KBG).

12167,Effects of endophytic fungi on some drought tolerance mechanisms of tall fescue in a hydroponics culture,"Neotyphodium, a seed-transmissible nonpathogenic fungal endophyte (symbiont) is considered beneficial because endophyte-infected grasses are more drought-tolerant, produce more dry matter, utilize soil nitrogen more efficiently, and deter insects. In this study, the effects of endophytes on physiological mechanisms of drought tolerance in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) were studied in a greenhouse. Two clonally propagated genotypes of tall fescue (F. arundinacea Schreb.), naturally containing endophyte (EI), and their endophyte-free ramets (EF) were tested at three water stress treatments exerted by PEG 6000 in a hydroponics system. Relative water content (RWC), cell membrane stability (CMS), proline and chlorophyll contents in plant leaves were measured during water stress treatments. After harvest, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ contents were measured in plant roots and shoots. After 20 days under stress conditions, plants were transferred to basal hydroponics medium, and their survival after stress relief was evaluated. The results showed that endophyte considerably contributes to host grass water stress tolerance. Both genotypes of EI and EF plants did not differ in RWC, but, regardless of the infection status, genotype 75 had the higher RWC than genotype 83. EI clones of both genotypes maintained slightly higher chlorophyll content and membrane stability than EF clones, although these differences were not significant. The EI plants of genotype 83 concentrated significantly more proline than EF plants, but in the genotype 75, differences between EI and EF clones were not significant. Plant mineral absorption was also influenced by the endophyte presence. EI clones had the higher concentrations of K+ in the shoots of both genotypes. The Mg2+ and Ca2+ contents in EF plants of both genotypes were higher than EI plants in the roots, but in the shoots there were no differences between EI and EF clones.

1254,Fungal endophytes of Festuca rubra increase in frequency following long-term exclusion of rabbits,"Plant -fungal endophyte interactions are common in nature and they can shape the ecology of plants. Vertically transmitted endophytes are hypothesized to serve as mutualists, protecting plants from herbivores. If this hypothesis is true, then we expect endophytes to be most abundant in the presence of herbivores and least abundant in their absence, assuming endophytes incur a cost to their host. We tested this prediction by studying the effects of intense rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus Linnaeus) grazing on grass-endophyte interactions at Silwood Park, UK. We examined seeds of red fescue (Festuca rubra L.) collected from 15 natural populations that were protected from rabbits for 0.3-21 years. Contrary to our prediction, the mean proportion of seeds with endophytes increased 1.84x, from 0.45 to 0.83, following 21 years of rabbit exclusion. To better understand the mechanisms driving this increase in frequency, we conducted a fully factorial greenhouse experiment where we manipulated the presence or absence of endophyte infection, intraspecific competition, and simulated grazing on F. rubra plants. In both damaged and undamaged treatments, infected plants produced approximately twice as much biomass as uninfected plants, and endophytes did not influence tolerance to herbivory. These results suggest that endophytes directly change plant growth but not compensatory responses to damage. In the absence of competitors, infected plants produced 2.17x more biomass than uninfected plants, whereas in the presence of competitors, infected plants produced only 1.55x more biomass than uninfected plants. This difference suggests that intraspecific competition might lessen the benefits of endophyte infection. Our results do not support the defensive mutualism hypothesis, but instead suggest that endophyte-induced plant growth is important in shaping the costs and benefits of endophytes in our system.","Santangelo, JS; Turley, NE; Johnson, MTJ",BOTANY,2015,10.1139/cjb-2014-0187,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.972090419222765,TRUE,3,5,Medium,absence of endophyte,examined; examined; collected; tested,"in frequency, we conducted a fully factorial greenhouse experiment where we manipulated the presence or absence of endophyte infection, intraspecific competition, and simulated grazing on F. rubra plants.

Zn induced a decrease in growth of plants at 1, 5 and 10 mM and cessation of growth at 20 mM ZnSO4. From 1 to 10 mM, the decrease was less pronounced in the presence of the endophytic fungus than in its absence. The growth limitation was due to an accumulation of Zn in leaves. From 8 to 15 days, the presence of the fungus in the plant led to a limitation of the Zn concentration in the leaves (24-32% lower with N. lolii than without). This restriction of Zn concentrations in leaves also had a beneficial effect on photosystem II (PSII) activities, net photosynthetic rate and internal CO2 concentration. Particularly at 1 and 5 mM, the quantum yield of electron flow throughout PSII was greater in the presence of the fungus than in its absence and at 5 and 10 mM, the internal CO2 concentration was maintained at a normal level.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate genetic variation for maturity and plant morphological traits, both among and within tall fescue cv. 'Kentucky 31' populations from 18 to 38 year-old pastures in Alabama. Ten populations of approximately 50 plants each were collected from old Alabama tall fescue pastures. Two pastures were sampled in each of five counties, representing the five major land use areas of the state. In 1990, spaced plants of all populations were evaluated at heading time for maturity, morphological, and disease traits at two locations in central Alabama. Endophyte infection level of the populations ranged from 2 to 100 %. Maturity was highly correlated with tiller length and flag leaf width and was used as a covariate for these traits in the analysis of variance. Leaf rust and net blotch ratings were negatively correlated. Significant variation among populations was observed for maturity and flag leaf dimensions, most variation being due to differences among source counties. Significant variation was observed within all populations for maturity and morphological traits, but only in seven populations for leaf rust. No within-population variation was detected for net blotch. The average precipitation for the month of May explained 81 % of the variation among populations for maturity. Age of the pasture sampled had a significant effect on tiller diameter (r2 = 0.55), and latitude of the pasture sampled was the best individual predictor of leaf width (r2 = 0.42).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of ergot alkaloid consumption on growth, scrotal circumference (SC), and semen quality. The SC measurement and percentage of motile and normal sperm were used to determine if a bull passed the breeding soundness exam (BSE) requirements. Bulls (n = 14) between 13 and 16 mo of age exhibiting >= 32 cm SC and having passed a BSE were assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments accounting for BCS and BW. Bulls were fed the treatment diet containing toxic tall fescue seed (E+; 0.8 mu g of ergovaline and ergovalanine/g DM) or the control diet containing endophyte-free nontoxic tall fescue seed (E-) for 126 d. Blood samples were collected and BSE and BCS accessed at the start of the test (d 0) and every 21 d to the end of test (d 126). Weights were obtained on d 0 and d 126. Serum prolactin (PRL) concentrations were affected by treatment x day interactions (P = 0.04) verifying the effectiveness of the E+ diet. Bulls consuming the E+ diet exhibited declining PRL concentrations from 250 +/- 52.1 ng/mL on d 0 to 30.6 +/- 46.9 ng/mL by d 126 whereas bulls receiving the E- ration maintained serum PRL concentrations greater than or equal to 226.7 +/- 50.4 ng/mL across the 126-d study.

This study determined the microbial communities both within the seed (endophytic) and on the seed surface (epiphytic) and of the protective glumes by using Illumina sequencing technology. Epichloe gansuensis decreased the richness of the seed-borne microbiota except for the epiphytic fungi of glumes and also decreased the diversity of seed-borne microbiota. In addition, metabolites of seeds and glumes were detected using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Unlike with the seeds of EF plants, the presence of E. gansuensis resulted in significant changes in the content of 108 seed and 31 glume metabolites.

Some of these endophytes make their grass partners less suitable as hosts for endoparasitic nematodes, including Pratylenchus spp. The potential for ergot alkaloids to affect nematode motility was investigated in vitro. Ergovaline, the ergot alkaloid pathway end product of several Neotyphodium spp., was the only ergot alkaloid tested that inhibited motility of Pratylenchus scribneri.

Rhizodeposit solutions collected over nine weeks from E+ grass contained more organic carbon and carbohydrates than E-. These solutions were allowed to percolate through columns of plant-free soils to assess the response of the soil microbial communities. Soils to which solutions from E+ grass were applied had significantly higher respiration rates than those receiving solutions from E- grass, suggesting that microbial activity was stimulated by changes in the rhizodeposits. Culture-based assays of the soil microbial community (plate counts and community-level physiological profiling) suggest that the basic structure of the microbial community was not affected by application of rhizodeposit solutions from E+ plants as compared to E-. Our results indicate that the presence of a fungal endophyte may enhance rhizodeposition by tall fescue and could consequently influence microbial mineralization processes in the soil.

On d 8, the rumen was emptied and rinsed. A buffer containing VFA was incubated in the following sequence: control (CON), 15 μg ergovaline·kg BW(-1) (1×EXT) from a tall fescue seed extract, and 45 μg ergovaline·kg BW(-1) (3×EXT). For each buffer treatment there were two 30-min incubations: a 30-min incubation of a treatment buffer with no sampling followed by an incubation of an identical sampling buffer with the addition of Cr-EDTA and deuterium oxide (D2O). Epithelial blood flow was calculated as ruminal clearance of D2O corrected for influx of physiological water and liquid outflow. Feed intake decreased with dosing E+ seed at HS but not at thermoneutral conditions (TN; P<0.02). Dosing E+ seed decreased serum prolactin (P<0.005) at TN.

Our objective was to test the hypothesis that nontoxic-endophyte infected tall fescue swards (Nontoxic-E) were more resistant to reinfestation by volunteer tall fescue and its associated toxic endophyte, than endophyte-free tall fescue swards (E-). Plots of E- and Nontoxic-E tall fescue (cultivar Jesup) with six levels of contamination by endophyte-infected K31 (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50% of viable seed weight) were established from seed at three sites in Ohio during April 2001. Observed endophyte levels for E- at the Jackson site were 77, 118, and 143% greater than expected in autumn 2001, spring 2002, and autumn 2002, respectively.

20316,Extensive host range of an endophytic fungus affects the growth and physiological functions in rice (Oryza sativa L.),"Endophytic Phomopsis sp. was isolated from the inner bark of Bischofia polycarpa. Many previous studies indicated that endophyte was ubiquitous and located within extensive host ranges, and indirect evidence had shown that Phomopsis sp. Might be an ""inducible mutualism"" endophyte and horizontally transmitted. Nevertheless, little attention was paid to whether an inducible endophyte can locate into non-host plant tissues, and how it influences plant physiological mechanisms still remains unclear. In the present study, we attempted to inoculate the endophyte into rice, hypothesizing that inducible endophytes could have particular beneficial effects on non-host plants. Inoculation and infection tests proved that the endophyte established a symbiotic relationship with the rice plant and existed in the leaf tissue. Then we tested the hypothesis in two ways. First, the effects of diluted endophyte inoculum on the germination of seeds were evaluated. Second, at the seedling stage (4-leaf stage), seedlings in pots were treated with the endophyte inoculum under controlled environmental conditions. Parameters including numbers of tillers, plant height, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, grain yield, and antioxidant enzyme activity were measured. These parameters differed between endophyte-infected and endophyte-free plants, especially at the germination and seedling stages, being significantly greater in endophyte-infected plants; however, the endophyte made no obvious contribution to the grain yield of rice. The results revealed that the endophyte promoted growth, antioxidant enzyme activity, and photosynthesis. Therefore, endophytic Phomopsis sp. may be useful as a growth-promoting microbial agent for enhancing the vigor and optimizing the quality of plants in agriculture, horticulture, and forestry.","Yuan, ZL; Dai, CC; Li, X; Tian, LS; Wang, XX",SYMBIOSIS,2007,NA,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.851632307961387,TRUE,3,4,Medium,endophyte-free,isolated; tested; evaluated,"rate, grain yield, and antioxidant enzyme activity were measured.

5161,"Chitin-mediated changes in bacterial communities of the soil, rhizosphere and within roots of cotton in relation to nematode control","Changes in microbial communities associated with nematode control were studied by comparing population numbers of fungi and bacteria in the soil and in internal root tissues (endorhiza) in non-amended and chitin-amended soils. Addition of chitin to soil at 1% (w/w) eliminated plant-parasitic nematodes in a first planting of cotton cv. 'Rowden' and significantly reduced Meloidogyne incognita infestation in a second planting, confirming long-term nematode suppressiveness induced by this organic amendment. The chitin amendment was associated with an increase in fungal and bacterial populations, especially those with chitinolytic activity. The bacterial communities of soil, rhizosphere and endorhiza were assessed by examining the taxonomic diversity of recoverable bacteria based on identification with fatty acid analysis of sample sizes of 35 soil and rhizosphere bacteria and 25 endophytic bacteria. All major bacterial species which formed at least 2% of the total population in non-amended soils and rhizospheres also occurred with chitin amendment. In contrast, chitin-amended soils and rhizospheres yielded several species which were not found without chitin amendment, including Aureobacterium testaceum, Corynebacterium aquaticum and Rathayibacter tritici. Burkholderia cepacia was recovered from both amended and non-amended soils and rhizospheres, but it was most abundant with chitin amendment at the end of the first cotton planting. Soil was probably the major source for bacterial endophytes of cotton roots, since nearly all endophytic bacteria were also found in the soil or rhizosphere. However, two dominant genera in the soil and rhizosphere, Bacillus and Arthrobacter, were not detected as endophytes. Chitin amendment exhibited a further specific influence on the endophytic bacterial community; Phyllobacterium rubiacearum was not a common endophyte following chitin amendment, even though chitin amendment stimulated its populations in non-planted soil. Burkholderia cepacia, found in similar numbers in the soil of both treatments, was the dominant endophyte in plants grown in chitin-amended soil but rarely colonized cotton roots grown in non-amended soil.

Ninety lambs, aged approximately 6 months, were grazed on plots of perennial ryegrass infected with either AR98 endophyte (containing lolitrem B), standard endophyte (containing lolitrem B and ergovaline) or no endophyte, for up to 42 days from 2 February 2010. Ten lambs were grazed on three replicate plots per cultivar. Herbage samples were collected for alkaloid analysis and lambs were scored for ryegrass staggers (scores from 0-5) weekly during the study. Any animal which was scored ≥4 was removed from the study.

Rat anterior pituitaries (AP) were dissected into halves and placed in temperature-controlled culture chambers (37 degrees C). The tissue was perfused with culture media at a flow rate of 12 mL/h. After perfusion for at least 90 min with control media, AP halves were exposed to their respective treatments for 15 min before they were returned to the control media. The treatments for Exp. 1 were .01 micrograms of alpha-ergocryptine/mL of culture medium, .01 microgram of ergonovine/mL of culture medium, .01 gram-equivalents of endophyte-infected tall fescue seed/mL of culture medium, and .01 gram-equivalents of endophyte free tall fescue seed/mL of culture medium. Treatments for Exp. 2 consisted of 10(-4), 10(-6), and 10(-8) M concentrations of perloline, N-formyl loline, N-acetyl loline, N-methyl loline, and alpha-ergocryptine. alpha-Ergocryptine suppressed (P less than .10) prolactin secretion in both experiments.

17580,Constriction of bovine vasculature caused by endophyte-infected tall fescue seed extract is similar to pure ergovaline.,"Ergovaline has been extensively used to study vasoactive effects of endophyte- (Neotyphodium coenophialum) infected tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum). However, initial results indicated that an extract of toxic tall fescue seed (E+EXT) is more potent than ergovaline alone in a right ruminal artery and vein bioassay. The E+EXT induced a greater contractile response than an equal concentration of ergovaline alone in the ruminal artery of heifers (P = 0.018). This led to a hypothesis that other compounds in the seed extract contribute to vasoconstriction. Thus, experiments were conducted to determine if vasoactivity of an E+EXT is different from a mixture of ergot alkaloids (ALK; ergovaline, ergotamine, ergocristine, ergocryptine, ergocornine, ergonovine, and lysergic acid) of similar concentrations and to determine if the vasoactivity of an E+EXT differs from an endophyte-free tall fescue seed extract (E-EXT). Segments of lateral saphenous vein and right ruminal artery and vein were collected from Holstein steers (n = 6) shortly after slaughter. Vessels were cleaned of excess connective tissue and fat and sliced into segments that were suspended in a multimyograph chamber with 5 mL of continually oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer, equilibrated for 90 min, and exposed to a reference compound (120 mM KCl for ruminal vessels and 0.1 mM norepinephrine for saphenous vein). Increasing concentrations of each treatment (E+EXT, E-EXT, ALK, and ergovaline) were added to the respective chamber every 15 min after buffer replacement. Data were normalized as a percentage of maximal contractile response of the reference compound and fit to a sigmoidal concentration response curve. Ergovaline, ALK, and E+EXT induced similar responses in the saphenous vein, ruminal artery, and ruminal vein. The E+EXT displayed a smaller EC(50) (half maximal effective concentration) than ergovaline or ALK in the saphenous vein and ruminal vein (P < 0.008), but not the ruminal artery (P = 0.31). Extrapolated maximum response was greatest in the saphenous vein for ergovaline, least for E+EXT, and intermediate for ALK (P < 0.0001).

L. hybridum) sown with the white clover cultivar Grasslands Huia (Trifolium repens), were evaluated under frequent/hard grazing or infrequent/lax grazing. Dry matter (DM) yields and species composition were assessed for 5 1/2 years. Ryegrass tiller and white clover growing point population densities were determined annually, and leaf:stem ratios every spring and autumn. Ryegrass tillers were assessed for infection with an Acremonium-like endophytic fungus and bacterial wilt disease (Xanthomonas campestris pv. graminis). The Italian ryegrass cultivars Moata and Concord had total yields 33% greater than the mean of the other cultivars (1800 kg DM/ha) over the first autumn and winter. The Italian cultivars persisted well for 3 years, except Concord which had a high incidence (34%) of bacterial wilt. Of the hybrid ryegrasses, cultivar Corvette had high ryegrass yields in the first year (9800 kg DM/ha), similar to those of the Italian cultivars, and continued to be high-yielding and persistent throughout the experiment. However, its degree of aftermath heading was high and probably reduced ryegrass herbage quality in summer and autumn. An inverse relationship between ryegrass yield and white clover yield resulted in few significant differences in total yields between cultivars. Infrequent/lax grazing maximised total annual yields (+5%) but decreased white clover yields (-13%). With the importance placed on achieving high white clover growth in the cool temperate environment of Southland, choice of ryegrass cultivar should consider factors such as pasture quality (primarily percentage composition of white clover), tolerance of the cultivar to a range of grazing managements, and seasonal herbage production.

17967,Effects of endophyte-infected tall fescue seed and protein supplementation on stocker steers: I. Growth performance and hemodynamic responses.,"Fescue toxicosis is a multifaceted syndrome common in cattle grazing endophyte-infected tall fescue and is detrimental to growth and performance. Recent research has shown that supplementing protein has the potential to enhance growth performance in weaned steers. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of supplemental CP on physiological parameters in stocker steers experiencing fescue toxicosis. Thirty-six weaned Angus steers (6 mo of age) stratified by weight (196.1 ± 3.6 kg) were assigned to a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement for 56 d: endophyte-free (EF) seed and 14% CP (EF-14; n = 9), EF seed and 18% CP (EF-18; n = 9), endophyte-infected (EI) seed and 14% CP (EI-14; n = 9), and EI seed and 18% CP (EI-18; n = 9). Steer growth and hemodynamic responses were collected weekly during ergot alkaloid exposure. On day 14 of the trial, iButton temperature data loggers were subcutaneously inserted in the lateral neck region to record hourly body temperature for 42 d. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED of SAS with repeated measures. No differences were observed in DMI, BW, ADG, F:G, or BCS during the treatment period (P > 0.05). Hair shedding scores, rectal temperatures, surface temperatures, and respiration rates were greater in EI steers compared to EF steers regardless of supplemental CP (P < 0.05). However, subcutaneous body temperature was greater in EI-14 steers (37.94 °C) compared to other steer groups (37.60, 37.68, 37.72 ± 0.04 °C for EF-14, EF-18, and EI-18, respectively; P < 0.05). Prolactin concentrations tended to be greater in EF steers when compared to EI steers (P = 0.07). Heart rate and hematocrit were reduced for EI-18 steers compared to other steer groups (P < 0.05). Caudal artery diameter was reduced in EI-18 steers compared to EI-14 steers (2.60 vs. 2.75 ± 0.05 mm, respectively; P < 0.05) and caudal vein diameter was reduced in EI-18 steers (3.20 mm) compared to all other steer groups (3.36, 3.39, 3.50 mm for EF-14, EF-18, and EI-14, respectively; P < 0.05). However, there was no difference observed in systolic or diastolic blood pressure during the treatment period (P > 0.05).

Among them, the strain 'Blu-v2', which was isolated from the seeds of cultivar 'Blue Umbrella' and identified to be Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, showed highest antifungal activity and capacity to deter feeding by Fall armyworms (Spodoptera fruigiperda). Lipopeptides in cultures of Blu-v2 were determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and its antifungal activities were verified. However, the lipopeptide preparation did not show toxicity to larvae of Fall armyworms. In a greenhouse experiment, Blu-v2 was inoculated into small plantlets of hosta (cultivar ` Rainforest Sunrise'). The leaves of plants with bacteria (endophyte-infected = E+) and without bacteria (endophyte-free = E-) were used in seven-day feeding experiments employing fourth-instar larvae of Fall armyworms. We found that there was a significant decrease in the weights of larvae fed with E+ compared to E-plants; and the mortality rate of larvae fed with E- leaves was lower (3.33%) compared to that of larvae fed with E+ leaves (30%).

These isolates were identified as Fusarium solani and Alternaria tenuissima, respectively, based on morphological characteristics and sequence analysis of internal transcribed spacer, TEF1, ATPase, and CAL regions. Subsequently, G. glabra plants were inoculated with these fungal isolates to examine their effect on glycyrrhizin production, plant growth parameters and the expression of key genes involved in glycyrrhizin pathway: SQS1, SQS2, bAS, CAS, LUS, CYP88D6, and CYP72A154. Endophytes were able to enhance glycyrrhizin content by 133%-171% in the plants. Natural control (NC) plants, harboring all natural endophytes, had better growth compared to SGGF14- and SGGF21-inoculated and endophyte-free (EF) plants.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the detrimental effects of feeding E+ to mares during early gestation. Mares (n = 12) paired by stage of gestation (d 65 to 100) were assigned to diets (six per diet) consisting of endophyte-free (E-) or E+ tall fescue seed (50% E- or E+ tall fescue seed, 45% sweet feed, and 10% molasses fed at 1.0% of BW/d). Mares also had ad libitum access to E+ or E- annual ryegrass hay, and were fed diets for 10 d. Following removal from the tall fescue diet on d 11, mares were placed on common bermudagrass pasture and monitored until d 21. Morning and evening rectal temperatures were recorded and daily blood samples were collected for progesterone and prolactin (PRL) analyses, whereas samples for 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl acetic acid (a catecholamine metabolite) analysis were collected on alternate days. For clinical chemistry analysis, blood samples were collected on d 0, 5, 10 and 21.

Severe billbug infestations occurred in 1981, 1983, and 1984 in two different turf evaluation field trials. Striking differences in cultivar response were observed. Subsequent investigations led to the discovery that billbug-resistant ryegrass entries had very high levels of endophyte infection; whereas, susceptible entries had little or no endophyte infection.

11651,Negative plant-soil feedbacks dominate seedling competitive interactions of North American successional grassland species,"Question Seed-transmitted fungal endophytes of grasses can influence competitive interactions via direct effects of infection on host plant performance or via indirect effects, such as plantsoil feedback effects that operate through changes to soil properties. To date, however, these direct and feedback effects have been evaluated separately. What is the relative importance of endophyte infection vs endophyte-mediated plantsoil feedback effects on competition between seedlings of the grass tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix) and common species of American Midwestern old-field successional grasslands? Location Long-term field experimental plots at the Indiana University Research and Teaching Preserve and greenhouse of Indiana University (Bloomington, IN, USA). Methods Endophyte-free (E-) and endophyte-infected (E+) tall fescue seedlings were grown individually and in intraspecific competition and pair-wise interspecific competition. Endophyte-mediated plantsoil feedback effects were incorporated by growing seedlings in soil conditioned by either E or E+ tall fescue. Results We found that E and E+ tall fescue experienced stronger intra- and interspecific competition when competing in self-conditioned soils. This pattern was consistent regardless of competitor identity. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the direct benefits of endophyte infection do not drive competitive responses of tall fescue at the early stages of plant development, at least under the conditions examined in our study. Rather, negative plantsoil feedbacks may be more important in moderating plant responses to competitive interactions during seedling establishment of this species.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of endophyte-tall fescue symbiosis on the rhizosphere quality indicators under different aeration conditions in a greenhouse pot experiment. The treatments were seven levels of air-filled porosity, AFP (0, 0.025, 0.050, 0.750, 0.100, 0.125 and 0.150 m(3 )m(-3)) in a sandy loam soil, and two genotypes (75C and 75B) of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea = Schedonorus arundinaceus Schreb.) each with endophytic fungus Epichloe coenophiala (E+) and without endophyte (E-). Soil biophysical properties were determined on the intact soil aggregates from rhizosphere zone: structural stability (by HEMC, high energy moisture characteristic), percent of water-stable aggregates, water repellency, basal soil respiration and soil organic matter. The results showed that by decreasing the AFP, and reducing redox potential to < 300 mV, (i) all biophysical indices, and the activity and population of soil microorganisms (especially fungi) significantly decreased, (ii) the role of biological and chemical aggregators was reduced and soil structure degradation was intensified, and (iii) aggregate stability indices and water repellency were associated with the quality of soil organic matter, rather than its quantity. Soil structural stability under genotype 75B was higher and lower than genotype 75C for the oxygen-limited and non-limited conditions, respectively.

Field grown and potted plants of endophyte-infected and endophyte-free clones of two tall fescue (A75 and A83) and one meadow fescue (P60) genotypes were rated for mildew infection type (1-9 scale) after inoculation with Blumeria graminis. Additionally, the reaction of 27 accessions of tall and meadow fescues and 65 accessions from 14 other plant species of the Poaceae family to powdery mildew was tested. No difference between endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) counterparts regarding disease score in potted plants was found. However, in A75 tall fescue and P60 meadow fescue genotypes, E+ clones had fewer powdery mildew infected leaves and lower disease indicies when compared with E- clones. Accessions of tall fescue and meadow fescue were all susceptible (rated a parts per thousand yen5) at the seedling stage but at the adult plant stage, tall fescue accessions were resistant and meadow fescue accessions remained susceptible. In the field trial, E+ and E- meadow fescue adult plants were damaged with up to 90 % dead leaves due to mildew infection however; tall fescue adult plants were resistant (rated < 5) regardless of endophyte status. Among the 65 accessions from the Poaceae family, the accessions of Lolium species were susceptible at the seedling stage whereas the other species did not react to powdery mildew. We concluded that endophyte had no effect on infection type of powdery mildew in tall and meadow fescues. In addition, susceptibility was observed in tall fescue and Lolium species to powdery mildew only at the seedling stage while meadow fescue genotypes were susceptible at both the seedling and adult plant stages.

In this study, selfed and half-sib family seeds were obtained from ten clonally propagated ryegrass plants among which two were endophyte-free (EF) and eight were endophyte-infected (EI). Then, 20 seed populations plus two commercial varieties of Speedy and Vigor were sown and evaluated in a biennial experiment for their turf and forage characteristics. Selfing caused significant inbreeding depression for plant fresh and dry weight and leaf length and width in the first year for both EI and EF genotypes. In the second year, only leaf length remained depressed among these characters. Also, for the most growth, turf and reproductive traits, EI populations showed less depression. The presence of endophyte in self-pollinated populations made an increasing effect for the number of seed per spike and days to heading, although seed weight was reduced. Some of the populations derived from self-pollination and infected with fungal endophyte including S9 and S10 were even superior to the two commercial varieties in terms of both seed production and turf characteristics. However, for seed-related characteristics including number of spikes per plant, seed weight and seed yield, EF populations including Speedy and Vigor were more reproductive than EI populations.

8928,Induced Defense in Ryegrass-Epichloë Symbiosis Against Listronotus bonariensis: Impact on Peramine Levels and Pest Performance,"The Argentine stem weevil (ASW), a major pest in ryegrass pastures, causes significant agricultural losses. Ryegrass can establish a symbiotic association with Epichlo & euml; endophytic fungi, which supply chemical defenses, including peramine. This symbiosis helps protect ryegrass by providing peramine, which acts as a primary defense. In addition, ryegrass can activate induced defense mechanisms, with peramine remaining the central agent in response to herbivorous insect attacks. Therefore, this study assessed the feeding of the ASW on ryegrass carrying endophytic fungus and peramine levels in aerial organs and its effects on pest performance. Argentine stem weevil adults and larvae were placed on ryegrass leaves and stems to assess feeding. Two treatments were used: endophyte-free plants and endophyte-colonized plants. After ASW feeding damage, insect consumption was measured by the leaf area consumed. To evaluate peramine production and its increase in response to ASW attack, peramine levels in leaves were analyzed using liquid chromatography. Damaged E+ ryegrass plants showed significant increases in peramine, with adult and larval herbivory raising levels by 291% and 216% in stems and by 135% and 85% in leaves, respectively, compared to controls. Endophyte-free (E-) plants experienced more ASW damage, as insects preferred feeding on them, showing reduced activity as peramine levels rose in endophyte-infected (E+) plants. An oviposition assay confirmed insect preference for endophyte-free (E-) plants. Additionally, larvae reared on endophyte-infected (E+) plants had lower survival rates, correlating negatively with peramine levels. These results emphasize peramine's role in strengthening ryegrass defenses against ASW, impacting both feeding and larval development.","Chacón-Fuentes, M; León-Finalé, G; Lizama, M; Gutiérrez-Gamboa, G; Martínez-Cisterna, D; Quiroz, A; Bardehle, L",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2025,10.3390/jof11010050,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.968766275859744,TRUE,3,4,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS; analyzed; assessed,"larvae were placed on ryegrass leaves and stems to assess feeding.

7103,Endophytic fungi and drought tolerance: ecophysiological adjustment in shoot and root of an annual mesophytic host grass,"Epichloid endophytic fungi, vertically transmitted symbionts of grasses, can increase plant tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress. Our aim was to identify ecophysiological mechanisms by which the endophyte Epichloe occultans confers drought tolerance to the annual grass Lolium multiflorum Lam. Endophyte-associated or endophyte-free plants were either well-watered or subjected to water deficit. We evaluated plant biomass, root length and nitrogen concentration, and we assessed intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) and its components net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, by carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of shoot tissues. Endophyte-free plants produced more biomass than endophyte-associated ones at field capacity, while water deficit strongly reduced endophyte-free plants biomass. As a result, both types of plants produced similar biomass under water restriction. Based on oxygen isotope composition of plant cellulose, stomatal conductance decreased with water deficit in both endophyte-associated and endophyte-free plants. Meanwhile, carbon isotope composition indicated that iWUE increased with water deficit only in endophyte-associated plants. Thus, the isotope data indicated that net photosynthesis decreased more strongly in endophyte-free plants under water deficit. Additionally, endophyte presence reduced root length but increased its hydraulic conductivity.

In this study, two endophytic fungi, Trichoderma harzianum, and Fusarium solani, were recovered from the roots of trees in desert regions of Iran. A greenhouse experiment with two fungal agents (control, T. harzianum, F. solani, and T. harzianum + F. solani) and drought (100, 75, and 50% water-holding capacity) was performed on maize (Zea mays L.). Findings indicate that increasing drought levels negatively affect maize plant growth and physiological traits. However, the symbiotic relationship between fungal endophytes and maize roots increased fresh and dry biomass, root/shoot ratio, leaf area, relative water content, and membrane stability index compared with their control counterparts. Maize plants inoculated with endophytic fungi had 52.07, 40, 33.03, and 55.62% higher total phenolic, proline and soluble sugar concentrations, respectively than uninoculated controls.

10387,High nitrogen supply and carbohydrate content reduce fungal endophyte and alkaloid concentration in Lolium perenne,"The relationship between cool-season grasses and fungal endophytes is widely regarded as mutualistic, but there is growing uncertainty about whether changes in resource supply and environment benefit both organisms to a similar extent. Here, we infected two perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) cultivars (AberDove, Fennema) that differ in carbohydrate content with three strains of Neotyphodium lolii (AR1, AR37, common strain) that differ intrinsically in alkaloid profile. We grew endophyte-free and infected plants under high and low nitrogen (N) supply and used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to estimate endophyte concentrations in harvested leaf tissues. Endophyte concentration was reduced by 40% under high N supply, and by 50% in the higher sugar cultivar. These two effects were additive (together resulting in 75% reduction). Alkaloid production was also reduced under both increased N supply and high sugar cultivar, and for three of the four alkaloids quantified, concentrations were linearly related to endophyte concentration. The results stress the need for wider quantification of fungal endophytes in the grassland-foliar endophyte context, and have implications for how introducing new cultivars, novel endophytes or increasing N inputs affect the role of endophytes in grassland ecosystems.","Rasmussen, S; Parsons, AJ; Bassett, S; Christensen, MJ; Hume, DE; Johnson, LJ; Johnson, RD; Simpson, WR; Stacke, C; Voisey, CR; Xue, H; Newman, JA",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,2007,10.1111/j.1469-8137.2006.01960.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990048052754922,TRUE,3,4,Medium,endophyte-free,pcr; qpcr,"of Neotyphodium lolii (AR1, AR37, common strain) that differ intrinsically in alkaloid profile.

8947,Lamiaceae family-derived endophytic fungi: induced tolerance to drought stress in Thymus vulgaris plants,"BackgroundThymus vulgaris is a valuable medicinal plant widely cultivated for its aromatic and medicinal properties. However, like many plants, T. vulgaris faces challenges such as drought stress, which significantly affects its growth, morphological, physiological, and biochemical processes. Understanding how endophytic fungi isolated from Lamiaceae family influence T. vulgaris under varying watering regimes can enhance its resilience against drought stress. This study aims to assess the impact of individual and co-inoculation of three native endophytic species, i.e., Fusarium sp. (F1), Cladosporium puyae (F2), and Curvularia australiensis (F3), on T. vulgaris growth parameters under different irrigation regimes in greenhouse conditions.ResultsIt has been discovered that using fungal endophytes as a biological tool can benefits T. vulgaris under drought stress. The results indicated that drought stress significantly reduced the growth, chlorophyll, and carotenoid content of plants lacking endophytes. Combinatory applications with fungal endophytes significantly improved the above-mentioned parameters under drought stress. Lipid peroxidation levels were significantly reduced in plants inoculated with bacterial endophytes. Drought stress significantly increased the activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) in drought conditions.ConclusionsThe findings suggested that the addition of fungal endophytes to the inoculum enhances drought tolerance in T. vulgaris by mitigating the harmful impact of drought stress on plant growth and physiological functions. The higher activity of antioxidant enzymes and improved redox state of glutathione are responsible for plants' greater resistance to drought.","Kamyab, A; Samsampour, D; Ahmadinasab, N; Bagheri, A",BMC PLANT BIOLOGY,2024,10.1186/s12870-024-05764-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.969105590286945,TRUE,3,4,Medium,lacking endophytes,isolated; ITS,NA,"stress, which significantly affects its growth, morphological, physiological, and biochemical processes.

5152,Does Epichloe Endophyte Enhance Host Tolerance to Root Hemiparasite?,"Epichloe endophytes have been shown to be mutualistic symbionts of cool-season grasses under most environmental conditions. Although pairwise interactions between hemiparasites and their hosts are heavily affected by host-associated symbiotic microorganisms, little attention has been paid to the effects of microbe-plant interactions, particularly endophytic symbiosis, in studies examining the effects of parasitic plants on host performance. In this study, we performed a greenhouse experiment to examine the effects of hereditary Epichloe endophyte symbiosis on the growth of two host grasses (Stipa purpurea and Elymus tangutorum) in the presence or absence of a facultative root hemiparasite (Pedicularis kansuensis Maxim). We observed parasitism of both hosts by P. kansuensis: when grown with a host plant, the hemiparasite decreased the performance of the host while improving its own biomass and survival rate of the hemiparasite. Parasitized endophyte-infected S. purpurea plants had higher biomass, tillers, root:shoot ratio, and photosynthetic parameters and a lower number of functional haustoria than the endophyte-free S. purpurea conspecifics. By contrast, parasitized endophyte-infected E. tangutorum had a lower biomass, root:shoot ratio, and photosynthetic parameters and a higher number of haustoria and functional haustoria than their endophyte-free counterparts. Our results reveal that the interactions between the endophytes and the host grasses are context dependent and that plant-plant interactions can strongly affect their mutualistic interactions. Endophytes originating from S. purpurea alleviate the host biomass reduction by P. kansuensis and growth depression in the hemiparasite. These findings shed new light on using grass-endophyte symbionts as biocontrol methods for the effective and sustainable management of this weedy hemiparasite.","Bao, GS; Son, ML; Wang, YQ; Saikkonen, K; Li, CJ",MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,2021,10.1007/s00248-020-01496-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.842466096098525,TRUE,3,4,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS; observed,"tillers, root:shoot ratio, and photosynthetic parameters and a lower number of functional haustoria than the endophyte-free S. purpurea conspecifics.

A total of 1589 culturable fungi belonging to 38 taxa were isolated, in which Curvularia, Acrophialophora, Penicillium, and Aspergillus were the dominant genera. The Shannon indices of EF and rhizospheric fungi ranged from 1.80 to 2.56 and 0.73 to 2.11, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the EF have a close relationship with rhizospheric fungi. However, some fungi exhibited apparently species-specific habitat distribution patterns. Growth temperature tests indicated that 60.22% of the tested isolates were thermotolerant fungi and only 39.78% were mesophiles, and the number of heat-adapted fungi increased with increasing environmental temperatures. The strain G1-29, which was isolated from the roots of Hedyotis diffusa and identified as Curvularia crepinii, significantly improved host plant thermotolerance under laboratory conditions: the death rate of endophyte-infected plants was significantly lower than that of endophyte-free plants (t-test, p=.0158, df=4). Our results suggested that the EF and rhizospheric fungi associated with plants growing in geothermal ecosystems are diverse, and many of them have adapted to the high environmental temperatures.

We investigated the interaction between an unspecialized root fungal endophyte (Acremonium strictum) and the polyphagous moth Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), in greenhouse and laboratory bioassays. Specifically we examined in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) the systemic effects of the endophytic fungus on the host selection behaviour of female moths for oviposition and the volatile profiles of host plants to understand the mechanisms acting in this multi-trophic model system. Both laboratory and field strains of H. armigera moths oviposited more on leaves of A. strictum inoculated plants as compared to endophyte-free plants, both in free flight cages and in tethered moth laboratory experiments; the moth's preferences were significant between 10 and 18 days after inoculation. The analysis of volatile profiles showed strong quantitative differences between treatments. Endophyte inoculated plants emitted diverse terpenes and sesquiterpenes at significantly lower amounts as compared to endophyte free-plants, except for alpha-terpinene, which did not differ between the treatments, and trans-beta-caryophyllene, which was emitted in significantly higher amounts on inoculated plants. beta-Thujene and alpha-phellandrene accounted for 73.3 and 12.0% of total amounts of volatiles emitted from endophyte-free and inoculated plants, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that A. strictum is able to systemically influence the host selection of H. armigera moths for oviposition; conceivably mediated by the induced changes in volatile emissions (and probably additional biochemical parameters of the host plants, which have not been analysed so far). We argue for a more detailed assessment of micro-organisms invisibly colonizing plants, when studying plant-herbivore or multitrophic interactions.","Jallow, MFA; Dugassa-Gobena, D; Vidal, S",ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS,2008,10.1007/s11829-008-9033-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.926573564373329,TRUE,3,4,Medium,endophyte-free,examined; investigated; examined,"H. armigera moths oviposited more on leaves of A. strictum inoculated plants as compared to endophyte-free plants, both in free flight cages and in tethered moth laboratory experiments; the moth's preferences","the polyphagous moth Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), in greenhouse and laboratory bioassays.

Measurements included leaf relative leaf water content, chlorophyll content, peroxidase (POD) activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, proline (Pro) and soluble sugar (SS) of the perennial ryegrass. Changes in physiological indices such as SS content were examined to determine the effects of SA and endophytic fungi on perennial ryegrass under drought stress. It was found that the relative water content, chlorophyll content, POD activity and SS content of E+ were significantly higher (P<0.05) than those of E- L. perenne plants under drought stress. The addition of exogenous SA increased the relative water content, chlorophyll content, POD and SOD activities, and Pro and SS contents, while decreasing MDA content. The present study showed that exogenous SA solutions of 0.25 and 0.50 mmol•L-1 were best for enhancement of the drought tolerance of L. perenne. There was a significant (P<0.05) interaction effect between Epichloё endophyte and SA together on SOD activity, POD activity and chlorophyll content of perennial ryegrass. In summary, Epichloё endophyte and SA both improved the drought resistance of perennial ryegrass. Specifically, Epichloё endophyte and SA promoted osmotic adjustment and activity of oxygen radical scavenging system, and thereby increased the drought resistance of the host plant. © 2020, Editorial Office of Acta Prataculturae Sinica.

Seeds of two different ecotypes of B. auleticus, one of them infected with the endophyte Neotyphodium pampeanum (NpE+) and the other infected with the endophyte Neotyphodium tembladerae (NtE+) and their respectively endophyte-free (NpE-/NtE-) counterparts were used. Seeds of each ecotype and endophytic status were superficially disinfected and were randomly assigned to different treatments named: S+ (smut fungus inoculated) and S (mock-inoculated). It was evaluated the effect of U. bullata infection on plant characteristics in every stage of their life cycle: seedling emergence, vegetative growth, mortality and smut symptoms in the florets. In NtE+ infected plants, smut disease was almost completely suppressed, whereas in their endophyte-free counterparts (NpE-) the incidence of smut symptoms reached 64%. In NpE+ infected plants smut. incidence was significantly lower (7%) than in endophyte-free plants (39%). Although U. bullata infection decreased the emergence rate of both endophyte-infected and endophyte-free plants, neutral or protective effects of the endophytes were observed in seedling development and survival. The survival during the first year of NtE+ plants was higher than in their NtE- counterparts.

2813,"Effects of the fungal endophyte, Neotyphodium lolii, on net photosynthesis and growth rates of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) are independent of In planta endophyte concentration","Background and Aims, Neotyphodium lolii is a fungal endophyte of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), improving grass fitness through production of bioactive alkaloids. Neotyphodium species can also affect growth and physiology of their host grasses (family Poaceae, sub-family Pooideae), but little is known about the mechanisms. This study examined the effect of N. lolii on net photosynthesis (P.) and growth rates in ryegrass genotypes differing in endophyte concentration in all leaf tissues. 9 Methods Plants from two ryegrass genotypes, Nui D and Nui UIV, infected with N. lolii (E+) differing approx. 2-fold in endophyte concentration or uninfected clones thereof (E-) were grown in a controlled environment. For each genotype X endophyte treatment, plant growth rates were assessed as tillering and leaf extension rates, and the light response of P-n, dark respiration and transpiration measured in leaves of young (30-45 d old) and old (> 90 d old) plants with a single-chamber open infrared gas-exchange system. Key Results Neotyphodium lolii affected CO2-limited rates Of Pn, which were approx. 17% lower in E+ than E- plants (P < 0.05) in the young plants. Apparent photon yield and dark respiration were unaffected by the endophyte (P > 0.05). Neotyphodium lolii also decreased transpiration (P < 0.05), but only in complete darkness. There were no endophyte effects on Pn in the old plants (P > 0.05). E+ plants grew faster immediately after replanting (P < 0.05), but had approx. 10 % lower growth rates during mid-log growth (P < 0.05) than E- plants, but there was no effect on final plant biomass (P > 0.05). The endophyte effects on P. and growth tended to be more pronounced in Nui UIV, despite having a lower endophyte concentration than Nui D. Conclusions Neotyphodium lolii affects CO2 fixation, but not light interception and photochemistry of P.. The impact of N. lolii on plant growth and photosynthesis is independent of endophyte concentration in the plant, suggesting that the endophyte mycelium is not simply an energy drain to the plant.

1839,A fungal endophyte of a palatable grass affects preference of large herbivores,"Temperate grasses frequently acquire resistance to herbivores through a symbiosis with epichloid fungi that produces alkaloids of variable deterrent effects. However, in those cases without apparent endophyte negative effects on domestic herbivores, it is not clear whether plant consumption or preference is affected or not. We performed three experiments with 1-year-old steers (Bos taurus, Aberdeen Angus) and the annual grass Lolium multiflorum, infected or not by Epichloe occultans to evaluate preference and to identify the underlying tolerance mechanisms. The first experiment evaluated steer preference for L.multiflorum cultivated in plots with three endophyte infection frequencies (low, medium and high), and investigated the role of canopy structure and plant nutritional traits on preference. The second experiment evaluated preference for chopped grass, offered in individual trays with contrasting infection frequencies (low and high), to discard possible effects associated with canopy structure and to focus on nutritional traits. The third experiment was performed with a tray+basket design that separated visual and olfactory stimuli from nutritional traits. High endophyte infection frequencies reduced consistently animal preference, even after short (similar to 10min) feeding events. However, we did not find significant evidence of plant structural, nutritional, visual or olfactory traits. Our results discarded several potential mechanisms; therefore, the dissuasive effect of fungal endophytes on animal consumption might be related to other mechanisms, including, likely, alkaloids and changes on grass metabolome.","Hernández-Agramonte, IM; Semmartin, M; Omacini, M; Durante, M; Gundel, PE; De Battista, J",AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,2018,10.1111/aec.12554,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.971682926952307,TRUE,3,4,Medium,endophyte negative,medium; investigated; evaluated,"epichloid fungi that produces alkaloids of variable deterrent effects.

The discovery of a basidiomycete colonization in Verdoornia and it reappraisal of earlier morphological data confirms molecular evidence that this is a derived genus nested within the Aneuraceae rather than a primitive isolated taxon, as considered previously, Throughout the Aneuraceae, the basidiomycetes exhibit similar colonization patterns; initial proliferation of dikaryotic, non-clamp-forming hyphal coils within the host cells is followed by senescence and aggregation of collapsed hyphae into large masses. Multiple cycles of colonization are common. Dolipores with imperforate parenthesomes indicate that the fungi are all heterobasidiomycetes. In line with earlier cross-colonization experiments showing complete host specificity, differences in hyphal diameters and dolipore dimensions suggest that the fungi belong to different taxa.

17161,Drought tolerance conferred to sugarcane by association with Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus: a transcriptomic view of hormone pathways.,"Sugarcane interacts with particular types of beneficial nitrogen-fixing bacteria that provide fixed-nitrogen and plant growth hormones to host plants, promoting an increase in plant biomass. Other benefits, as enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses have been reported to some diazotrophs. Here we aim to study the effects of the association between the diazotroph Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus PAL5 and sugarcane cv. SP70-1143 during water depletion by characterizing differential transcriptome profiles of sugarcane. RNA-seq libraries were generated from roots and shoots of sugarcane plants free of endophytes that were inoculated with G. diazotrophicus and subjected to water depletion for 3 days. A sugarcane reference transcriptome was constructed and used for the identification of differentially expressed transcripts. The differential profile of non-inoculated SP70-1143 suggests that it responds to water deficit stress by the activation of drought-responsive markers and hormone pathways, as ABA and Ethylene. qRT-PCR revealed that root samples had higher levels of G. diazotrophicus 3 days after water deficit, compared to roots of inoculated plants watered normally. With prolonged drought only inoculated plants survived, indicating that SP70-1143 plants colonized with G. diazotrophicus become more tolerant to drought stress than non-inoculated plants. Strengthening this hypothesis, several gene expression responses to drought were inactivated or regulated in an opposite manner, especially in roots, when plants were colonized by the bacteria.

12593,"Role of fungal endophyte of tall fescue (Epichloe coenophiala) on water availability, wilting point and integral energy in texturally-different soils","Managing soil water and water uptake by plant roots is more crucial in the arid and semi-arid regions comparing to the other places. Beside the well-known plant available water (PAW) concept, integral energy (E-l) is recently suggested to quantify the energy required by plants for water uptake. A greenhouse study was conducted to examine the effect of aboveground fungal endophyte infection (Epichloe coenophiala) in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. =Schedonorus arundinaceus and Lolium arundinaceum) on soil water availability indices such as PAW and E-l in six texturally-different soils. The PAW was calculated as the difference between field capacity, theta(FC) [at matric suction, h, of 100 or 330 hPa (1 hPa =0.1 kPa)] and permanent wilting point, theta(PWP) (nominal value at h of 15000 hPa or actual h value determined in the greenhouse experiment). The E-l was computed by integration of soil water retention curve (determined using undisturbed soil samples) over the nominal and actual PAW ranges. The results indicated that h(PWP), the matric suction at actual permanent wilting point, of tall fescue is considerably greater than the conventional value (i.e., 15000 hPa) and its value was greater in endophyte-infected (E+) plant associated soils compared to endophyte-free (E-) ones (27572 hPa/2757 kPa for E+ vs. 21780 hPa/2178 kPa for E-) and the difference was greater in the coarse- to medium-textured soils. Moreover, E+ treatments, especially in the coarse- and medium-textured soils, had greater values of actual PAW and El. This shows that E+ plants were able to tolerate higher h values at similar conditions presumably due to induced drought-tolerance mechanisms. The effect of endophyte presence on increment of PAW(actual) and E-l(actual) in comparison with nominal values was much more evident in the coarse- and medium textured soils. This indicates that the error in calculations of the PAW and E-l values by considering theta(PWP) at h= 15000 hPa is relatively smaller in fine-textured soils. Nevertheless, nominal E, values were lower for E+ treatments indicating that in similar PAW, the plant needed lower energy to take up water from the PAW range because endophyte presence can affect soil water release path in the PAW range. Greater contribution of structural pores to water retention in E+ plant associated soils compared to E ones was related to greater sub-critical water repellency and aggregate stability and better physical quality in E+ plant associated soils. It is concluded that the presence of endophyte in tall fescue, especially in coarse- and medium-textured soils, affects soil water release path, increases PAW and thereby might raise water productivity in drought periods.

13573,Endophytic fungi in indigenous Australasian grasses associated with toxicity to livestock,"Grazing of Echinopogon spp. by livestock in Australia has caused symptoms similar to those of perennial ryegrass staggers. We observed an endophytic fungus in the intercellular spaces of the leaves and seeds of New Zealand and Australian specimens of Echinopogon ovatus. Culture of surface- sterilized seeds from New Zealand specimens yielded a slow-growing fungus.

No lolitrems (the indole-diterpenoids implicated as the causative agents of perennial ryegrass staggers), peramine analogs, or ergot alkaloids were detected in the infected specimens by high- performance liquid chromatography or ELISA. However, in endophyte-infected E. ovatus plants from New Zealand, analogs of the indole-diterpenoid paxilline (thought to be a biosynthetic precursor of the lolitrems and related tremorgens) were detected by ELISA, and N-formylloline was detected by gas chromatography. Endophyte-free specimens of New Zealand E. ovatus did not contain detectable paxilline analogs or lolines and were more palatable than infected specimens to adults of the pasture pest Listronotus bonariensis (Argentine stem weevil).

4536,Biocontrol Potential of a Novel Endophytic Bacterium From Mulberry (Morus) Tree,"Mulberry (Morus) is an economically important woody tree that is suitable for use in sericulture as forage and in medicine. However, this broad-leaved tree is facing multiple threats ranging from phytopathogens to insect pests. Here, a Gram-positive, endospore-forming bacterium (ZJU1) was frequently isolated from healthy mulberry plants by screening for foliar endophytes showing antagonism against pathogens and pests. Whole-genome sequencing and annotation resulted in a genome size of 4.06 Mb and classified the bacterium as a novel strain of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens that has rarely been identified from tree leaves. An integrative approach combining traditional natural product chemistry, activity bioassays, and high-resolution mass spectrometry confirmed that strain ZJU1 uses a blend of antimicrobials including peptides and volatile organic compounds to oppose Botrytis cinerea, a major phytopathogenic fungus causing mulberry gray mold disease. We showed that the inoculation of endophyte-free plants with ZJU1 significantly decreased both leaf necrosis and mortality under field conditions. In addition to the direct interactions of endophytes with foliar pathogens, in planta studies suggested that the inoculation of endophytes also induced plant systemic defense, including high expression levels of mulberry disease resistance genes. Moreover, when applied to the generalist herbivore Spodoptera litura, ZJU1 was sufficient to reduce the pest survival rate below 50%. A previously undiscovered crystal toxin (Cry10Aa) could contribute to this insecticidal effect against notorious lepidopteran pests. These unique traits clearly demonstrate that B. amyloliquefaciens ZJU1 is promising for the development of successful strategies for biocontrol applications. The search for new plant-beneficial microbes and engineering microbiomes is therefore of great significance for sustainably improving plant performance.","Xie, S; Vallet, M; Sun, C; Kunert, M; David, A; Zhang, XC; Chen, BH; Lu, XM; Boland, W; Shao, YQ",FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,2020,10.3389/fbioe.2019.00488,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.943711330373426,TRUE,3,4,Medium,endophyte-free,isolated; sequencing,a major phytopathogenic fungus causing mulberry gray mold disease.

16677,Growth rate and physiology of steers grazing tall fescue inoculated with novel endophytes.,"Cattle grazing tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) often develop fescue toxicosis. This condition is thought to be caused by ergot alkaloids produced by the endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum. Endophytes from wild tall fescue plants, which do not produce ergot alkaloids, were transferred into the endophyte-free tall fescue germplasm, HiMag. The novel associations also lacked the ability to produce ergot alkaloids. Our objective was to determine whether cattle grazing these novel endophyte associations showed signs of fescue toxicosis. At the Fayetteville, Arkansas location, tester steers (n = 72) were assigned to one of four pasture treatments: endophyte-free HiMag tall fescue (HiMag-); 'Kentucky-31' tall fescue infected with its native, toxic endophyte (KY+); and two novel endophyte-infected tall fescue associations, HiMag4 and HiMag9. At the Mount Vernon, Missouri location, steers (n = 54) were used to test three of the four cultivars (HiMag9 was not tested). Ergot alkaloid concentrations in the forage of HiMag4 and HiMag9 were low or undetectable. Respiration rate, rectal temperature, ADG, and hair scores were measured during the grazing period. Blood was collected via jugular venipuncture and used for prolactin, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), cholesterol, triglyceride, and creatinine analysis. Weight gains by steers grazing HiMag4 and HiMag9 did not differ from those of steers grazing HiMag-, but were greater than gains (P < 0.05) by steers on the KY+ treatment. Steers grazing KY+ had higher (P < 0.05) respiration rates, rectal temperatures, and hair scores than did steers grazing novel endophyte and HiMag- pastures. Prolactin, ALP, cholesterol, LDH, and triglycerides all were suppressed (P < 0.05) in steers grazing KY+ compared with steers grazing novel endophyte and HiMag- pastures.

12504,Interaction between fungal endophytes and environmental stressors influences plant resistance to insects,"Neotyphodium coenophialum, an endophytic fungus that infects shoots of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), may protect its host from herbivory through production of alkaloids. Yet, the fungus can also modify plant resource allocation, regrowth dynamics, and drought tolerance, and these changes may also influence herbivores. We tested if N. coenophialum infection interacted with stress (drought or simulated herbivory) to modify plant resistance to insects. We assigned greenhouse plants to one of four treatments: 1) clipping at 3 cm above the soil surface, 2) drought stress during insect bioassays, 3) drought stress prior to insect bioassays, or 4) daily watering. Treatments were crossed with presence or absence of endophyte to give eight treatment combinations, and we assessed the performance of bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi) and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) feeding on plants in two separate experiments from each of the eight treatments. Aphids were placed into clip bags on leaf blades and allowed to reproduce parthenogenetically. Plant tissue was fed to third instar fall armyworm caterpillars until they molted into the fifth instar. Developmental time was recorded and larval growth was obtained gravimetrically. We also assessed total protein nitrogen (N) and loline alkaloids in plants. Total protein N was unaffected by endophyte infection. In contrast, stress influenced total protein N, but its effect varied with endophyte infection. Uninfected plants that were clipped had higher total protein N; this trend was absent in infected plants. Plants in drought stress had lower N, but only if they were infected. Lolines were nearly absent from uninfected plants. In infected plants they tended to be higher in clipped plants. The effect of endophyte infection differed between the two insects: aphid reproduction was reduced by the endophyte, but endophyte infection enhanced caterpillar performance. Both insects were affected by interactions between the endophyte and stress. Aphids were negatively affected by drought stress, but only when feeding on uninfected plants, while caterpillars showed the opposite response, displaying lower performance on drought stressed plants only if they were infected. Aphids reproduced faster on regrowth tissue (following damage by clipping) of uninfected plants, but endophyte infection cancelled this effect. In contrast, performance of caterpillars was not influenced by an interaction between damage and infection. We conclude that N. coenophialum does not provide universal resistance to insects. Endophyte-mediated resistance varies with insect species and will be a complex function of environmental stress, including drought and prior damage.","Bultman, TL; Bell, GD",OIKOS,2003,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.11574.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.988793173003386,TRUE,3,4,Medium,absence of endophyte,ITS; assessed; tested,"stress prior to insect bioassays, or 4) daily watering.

11825,Endophytic Colonization of Onions Induces Resistance Against Viruliferous Thrips and Virus Replication,"In agricultural ecosystems, insect pests, pathogens, weather patterns, and reduced soil fertility pose major challenges to crop productivity and are responsible for significant yield losses worldwide. Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV) vectored by Thrips tabaci Lindeman, is a major hindrance to onion production in eastern Africa. Control measures often rely on insecticides with deleterious effects. Endophytes are one key alternative as they can play important roles in mediating induced systemic resistance. Hence, we examined the potential effect of endophytic fungus Hypocrea lixii (F3ST1) on feeding and replication of IYSV on endophyte-colonized (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) onion plants. For more precise assessment, replication was also tested using leaf disk bioassays and individual thrips. The number of feeding punctures was significantly lower in E+ as compared to E- plants. Disease level was significantly lower in E+ as compared to E- plants for four weeks post-exposure to thrips. IYSV replication was reduced by 2.5-fold in endophytic treatment on both whole plant and leaf disk assays. Thrips tabaci showed 2 times higher feeding activities on endophyte-free onion leaf disks as compared to the endophyte-inoculated leaf disks. Our results suggest potential utility of the endophytes to reduce feeding damage and virus infection on onion plants. Further studies should be conducted to elucidate the secondary metabolites involved in such endophyte-thripsvirus mediated interaction and determine whether the interactions extend for this and other onion varieties and viruses under field conditions.","Muvea, AM; Subramanian, S; Maniania, NK; Poehling, HM; Ekesi, S; Meyhöfer, R",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2018,10.3389/fpls.2018.01785,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.829598537627884,TRUE,3,4,Medium,endophyte-free,examined; examined; tested,"endophytic fungus Hypocrea lixii (F3ST1) on feeding and replication of IYSV on endophyte-colonized (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) onion plants.

Their artificial establishment as fungal endophytes to provide other benefits to the host plants aside mere protection against the primary pests has also been widely demonstrated. In the present study, two fungal strains of Beauveria bassiana and one strain of Isaria fumosorosea were assessed in a pathogenicity test against adults of Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri) and found to induce 50% reduction in the survival rate of D. citri adults within 5 days of exposure. The ability of the three fungal strains to endophytically colonize Citrus limon, the impact on plant growth and the effects of systemic colonization on 3 successive generations of D. citri feeding on colonized plants was evaluated. Citrus seedlings at 4 months post-planting were inoculated with each of the fungal strains via foliar spraying. Both strains of B. bassiana successfully colonized the seedlings. One of the B. bassiana strains (BB Fafu-13) was sustained up to 12 weeks in the colonized seedlings, whereas the other B. bassiana strain (BB Fafu-16) was only recovered up to 8 weeks post-inoculation. Isaria fumosorosea (IF Fafu-1) failed to colonize the plant. Both strains of B. bassiana induced significant improvement in plant height and flush production in endophytically colonized seedlings. In addition, endophytic B. bassiana caused 10-15% D. citri adult mortality within 7 days of exposure.

The experiment was designed in a completely randomized design with three replications. In the pot culture, a one-month drought stress was induced by limiting irrigation to 20 % of the field capacity for both E+ and E- L. perenne genotypes. The results demonstrated that endophyte infection could provide substantial physiological benefits to the host plant under drought stress conditions. Infected genotypes exhibited higher dry weight of aerial and root biomass, tiller numbers, and chlorophyll a content compared to control plants. At time 1, H2O2 concentrations were significantly higher in E- genotypes. The highest MDA levels were observed in E- genotypes at time 3. The activity of antioxidant enzymes involved in H2O2 degradation (CAT, APX, GOP) and the enzyme responsible for H2O2 production (SOD) was most pronounced in time 2 for E+ genotypes. Furthermore, drought stress induced the activity of GR and GST enzymes in the leaves of both E+ and E- Lolium genotypes, with the highest induction of these enzymes occurring two weeks after stress in E+ genotypes. These findings suggest that the antioxidant strategies of E+ Lolium genotypes are significantly altered when exposed to drought stress for two weeks.

For experimental purposes, the clones were planted separately into pots and subjected to three water supply levels: adequate (control), periodical reduced (drought) or periodical excessive (flooding). In the host genotype originally collected from a dry site. endophyte effects on vegetative and reproductive plant growth depended on water supply.

Aphid populations were quantified in a field trial near Ballarat, comparing yields of perennial ryegrass infected with eight different endophyte strains and an endophyte-free (Nil) control in a common ryegrass background (Grasslands Samson (G.

These differences were significantly related to yield increases taken before and after sampling that persisted until the end of the trial. In a pot trial comparing commercially available ryegrass-endophyte combinations with equivalent Nil controls, aphid numbers were lower on G. Samson AR37 and Banquet II with AR5 (Endo (R) 5) than on all other cultivar-endophyte combinations. Compared with Nil controls, the common toxic strain in G. Samson, and two strains in Trojan also reduced aphid numbers. The AR5 endophyte produces the alkaloid ergovaline but high concentrations of this in roots of potted plants could not account for differences in root aphid numbers.

The rhizosphere soil of wild endophyte-infected (W-EI) DHG had significantly (P < 0.05) higher available phosphorous and potassium, total organic matter, ammonium and nitrate nitrogen than cultivated soil. In addition, the rhizosphere soil of endophyte-infected DHG had significantly (P < 0.05) lower pH and nitrate nitrogen, and higher available phosphorous, than endophyte-free DHG under cultivated conditions. The sequencing provided a total of 54,413 sequences and these were assigned into 190 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 97% similarity. Ascomycota was the most dominant phylum in roots of three DHG populations. W-EI DHG had significantly (P < 0.05) higher RAF diversity than cultivated endophyte-infected (C-EI) DHG: The presence of endophyte significantly (P < 0.05) decreased RAF diversity under cultivation. The principal component analysis (PCA) and sample similarity analysis results indicated that both endophyte and soil disturbance could bring changes to RAF community composition.

This project investigated seed germination, physiological characteristics and antioxidant enzyme activities of Achnatherum inebrians in order to better understand the adaptation to saline soil environments exhibited by this species and provide information to aid future breeding selection and cultivation. A set of 20 different alkali-saline stress conditions were stimulated by mixing two neutral (NaCl and Na2SO4) and two alkaline (NaHCO3 and Na2CO3) salts with soil in different proportions (A: NaCl: Na2SO4=1: 1; B: NaCl: Na2SO4: NaHCO3=1: 2: 1; C: NaCl: Na2SO4: NaHCO3: Na2CO3=1: 9: 9: 1; D: NaCl: Na2SO4: NaHCO3: Na2CO3=1: 1: 1: 1; E: NaCl: Na2SO4: NaHCO3: Na2CO3 = 9: 1: 1: 9) and at concentrations of 50, 100, 150, and 200 mmol•L-1. These soil mixtures were used to grow seedlings of endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) drunken horse grass, and analyze the general salt tolerance of drunken horse grass accessions at the germination and seedling growth stages were analyzed. The seed germination rate, germination vigor, germination index, energy index and shoot length, root length, root-shoot ratio, and shoot tissue antioxidant enzymes peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline were evaluated and analyzed data explored by subordinate function analysis. It was found that the germination rate, germination potential, germination index and vigor index of both E+ and E- drunken horse grass were decreased under the five different saline-alkali stresses. Germination was significantly inhibited with increase in saline-alkali stress concentration (P< 0.05). The radicle length and root-shoot ratio were also significantly decreased with increased salt concentration. Except for treatments C and E, physiological indexes (POD, SOD and CAT activities, MDA and proline levels in shoot tissue) of drunken horse grass were reduced at higher salt concentrations. Subordinate function analysis and the multivariate analysis of salt tolerance indicated that the order of salt tolerance across treatments was A> D> B> C> E. In conclusion, saline-alkali stress significantly inhibited seed germination and seedling growth of drunken horse grass (P< 0.05). Among the alkaline salts tested (NaHCO3 and Na2CO3), Na2CO3, especially, had a stronger inhibitory effect on seed germination and growth. Vigor index, root length, POD, SOD, and proline were found to be the most useful indicators to evaluate the salt tolerance of drunken horse grass.

18139,Effects of red clover isoflavones on tall fescue seed fermentation and microbial populations in vitro.,"Negative impacts of endophyte-infected Lolium arundinaceum (Darbyshire) (tall fescue) are responsible for over $2 billion in losses to livestock producers annually. While the influence of endophyte-infected tall fescue has been studied for decades, mitigation methods have not been clearly elucidated. Isoflavones found in Trifolium pratense (red clover) have been the subject of recent research regarding tall fescue toxicosis mitigation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of ergovaline and red clover isoflavones on rumen microbial populations, fiber degradation, and volatile fatty acids (VFA) in an in vitro system. Using a dose of 1.10 mg × L-1, endophyte-infected or endophyte-free tall fescue seed was added to ANKOM fiber bags with or without 2.19 mg of isoflavones in the form of a control, powder, or pulverized tablet, resulting in a 2 × 3 factorial arrangements of treatments. Measurements of pH, VFA, bacterial taxa, as well as the disappearance of neutral detergent fiber (aNDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and crude protein (CP) were taken after 48 h of incubation. aNDF disappearance values were significantly altered by seed type (P = 0.003) and isoflavone treatment (P = 0.005), and ADF disappearance values were significantly different in a seed × isoflavone treatment interaction (P ≤ 0.05). A seed × isoflavone treatment interaction was also observed with respect to CP disappearance (P ≤ 0.05). Eighteen bacterial taxa were significantly altered by seed × isoflavone treatment interaction groups (P ≤ 0.05), eight bacterial taxa were increased by isoflavones (P ≤ 0.05), and ten bacterial taxa were altered by seed type (P ≤ 0.05).

The results demonstrated that Epichloe endophyte colonization significantly enhanced the intraspecific competitive ability of L. chinensis and that this beneficial effect was not affected by soil microbes. Under interspecific competition, however, significant interactions between Epichloe endophytes and soil microbes were observed. The effect of Epichloe endophytes on interspecific competitiveness of the host changed from positive to neutral with soil microbe removal. Here higher mycorrhizal colonization rates probably contributed to interspecific competitive advantages of EI over EF L. chinensis.

1543,Fungal endophyte and tall fescue cultivar interact to differentially affect bulk and rhizosphere soil processes governing C and N cycling,"Tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.)) is a cool-season perennial grass within which can live a fungal endophyte (Epichloe coenophiala) thought to provide enhanced edaphic and climactic stress tolerance to the host compared to non-infected individuals. Our prior research demonstrated that a variety of root exudate compounds released from tall fescue were differentially affected by tall fescue cultivar, endophyte genotype and their interaction. Changes in root exudates and associated microbial communities could influence soil processes, including carbon and nitrogen cycling, but these effects may differ depending on fescue and endophyte genetics. To test this, we collected rhizosphere and bulk soil samples from six year old field plots located in Lexington, KY planted with two different tall fescue cultivars (PDF and 97TF1), each containing four endophyte treatments [endophyte-free (E) or infected with one of three strains of E. coenophiala (common toxic, novel AR542E+ and novel AR584E+)]. The influence of fescue cultivar, endophyte strain, and soil sample location (rhizosphere vs. bulk) were assessed for soil organic carbon, soil organic nitrogen, particulate and non-particulate organic matter (POM and n-POM, respectively)- C and N, and dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC, DON) pools. Soil functional aspects were evaluated by measuring soil respiration and the activity of seven different soil enzymes related to C, N and P cycling. We found that rhizosphere soils had greater microbial biomass, potential enzyme activity, and oxygen utilization, but lesser POM-N concentrations than bulk soils. In rhizosphere soils, tall fescue cultivar had the greatest influence on soil microbial community structure, while endophyte genotype had a stronger influence on soil C fractions (notably POM-C). Changes in root system architecture, biomass,, and tissue composition, together with root exudate chemistry, which we have shown in previous studies to be affected by endophyte infection and fescue cultivar, likely explain these findings. There was greater POM-N in bulk soils which was influenced by the interaction of endophyte and cultivar potentially due to differences in the chemical composition of the tissues brought about by this interaction. Our results support current observations that tall fescue cultivar and fungal endophyte strain influence soil C and N cycling and, by analyzing bulk and rhizosphere soils separately, go further to show the level of influence cultivar and endophyte have within each of these compartments.

We investigated the effects of inoculating mandarin endophytic fungi, introduced formerly by our group, i.e. Penicillium citrinum, Aurobassium pullunts and Dothideomycetes sp., individually and in combination with each other on the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and antioxidant functions in plants under drought stress. To do so, mandarin (Citrus reticulata) scions grafted on Bakraii [Citrus reticulata x Citrus limetta] (Mandarin/Bakraii) were subjected to four irrigations interval including 2, 4, 6 and 8 days, in present/absent of the fungal endophytes. The results indicated that drought stress significantly reduced growth, chlorophyll, carotenoid content and chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) of the plants lacking endophytes. Combinatory applications with three fungal endophytes (P. citrinum + A. pullunts + Dothideomycetes sp.) significantly improved the above-mentioned parameters under drought stress. H2O2, O-2(-) and lipid peroxidation level were significantly reduced in the plants inoculated with fungal endophytes. Drought stress significantly increased activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione reductase (GR) and levels of ascorbate (ASA) and glutathione (GSH) and decreased activities of catalase (CAT), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) and dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR).

11817,"Silicon, endophytes and secondary metabolites as grass defenses against mammalian herbivores","Grasses have been considered to primarily employ tolerance in lieu of defense in mitigating damage caused by herbivory. Yet a number of mechanisms have been identified in grasses, which may deter feeding by grazers. These include enhanced silicon uptake, hosting of toxin-producing endophytic fungi and induction of secondary metabolites. While these mechanisms have been individually studied, their synergistic responses to grazing, as well as their effects on grazers, are poorly known. A field experiment was carried out in 5 x 5 m outdoor enclosures to quantify phytochemical changes of either endophyte-infected (E+) or endophyte-free (E-) meadow fescue (Schedonorus pratensis) in response to medium intensity (corresponding with densities of ca. 1200 voles/ha for 5 weeks during 3 months) or heavy intensity (ca. 1200 voles/ha for 8 weeks during 3 months) grazing by a mammalian herbivore, the field vole (Microtus agrestis). A laboratory experiment was then conducted to evaluate the effects of endophyte infection status and grazing history of the grass diet on vole performance. As predicted, grazing increased foliar silicon content, by up to 13%. Grazing also increased foliar levels of phosphorous and several phenolic compounds, most notably those of the flavonols isorhamnetin-diglycoside and rhamnetin derivative. Silicon concentrations were consistently circa 16% higher in E+ grasses than in E-grasses, at all levels of grazing. Similarly, concentrations of chlorogenic acid derivative were found to be consistently higher in E+ than in E grasses. Female voles maintained on heavily grazed grasses suffered higher mortality rates in the laboratory than female voles fed ungrazed grass, regardless of endophyte infection status.

5424,Trade-off between seed number and weight: Influence of a grass-endophyte symbiosis,"Plant fitness is enhanced by resource allocation to seed number (offspring number) or weight (offspring survival). Besides, there is a well known trade-off in resource allocation between both traits. Symbiotic interactions can influence plant resource allocation to reproduction, yet little research has been performed in this direction. We studied the consequences of a grass fungus symbiosis on the trade-off between seed number and weight, using Lolium multiflorum and the endophyte Neotyphodium occultans as our study system. In ecological terms, we experimentally removed N. occultans from L. multiflorum plants, and compared reproductive allocation to seed number and weight in endophyte-symbiotic vs. non-symbiotic plants at different levels of nutrient availability (small pots vs. large pots). In evolutionary terms, we compared reproductive allocation between symbiotic vs. non-symbiotic plants for different host genotypes. All plants showed a negative association between seed number and weight, once standardized for total reproductive biomass. Under high nutrient availability, endophyte-symbiotic plants showed higher seed weight than non-symbiotic plants for any seed number. However, no differences were observed under low nutrient availability. Endophyte influence also varied according to L. multiflorum genotype; specifically, endophyte-symbiotic plants showed a lower slope in the relationship between seed number and weight than non-symbiotic plants for the 'Marshall' genotype but no endophyte influence was found for the ""Pampean"" genotype. The results implied a higher plasticity in seed weight and lower plasticity in seed number for symbiotic plants. Indeed, endophyte-symbiotic plants showed an overall lower slope in the association between seed number and total reproductive biomass than non-symbiotic plants. Our results suggest that N. occultans induces heavier seeds in L. multiflorum plants under environmental conditions favorable to plant growth or for certain plant genotypes. We propose that symbiotic interactions may influence the evolution of seed number and weight trade-off.","Gundel, PE; Garibaldi, LA; Martínez-Ghersa, MA; Ghersa, CM",BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,2012,10.1016/j.baae.2011.10.008,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.737093747282416,TRUE,3,3,Medium,no endophyte,observed; studied,"the relationship between seed number and weight than non-symbiotic plants for the 'Marshall' genotype but no endophyte influence was found for the ""Pampean"" genotype.

20974,Interactions in sheep between tall fescue ergot alkaloids and hepatotoxic carbon tetrachloride and senecio pyrrolizidine alkaloids,"The interaction between ergot alkaloids in endophyte-infected (E+) tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) seed and pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) in tansy ragwort (TR; Senecio jacobaea) when simultaneously fed to sheep was investigated. Because of the hepatogenic effects of prolactin (PRL), it was hypothesized that low serum PRL induced by ergot alkaloids would increase the susceptibility of sheep to hepatotoxicity induced by PA. Sheep are normally resistant to PA-induced hepatotoxicity. Twenty-four wether lambs weighing 34.1±2.3 kg were used after being randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatments of 4 wethers each. The diets offered were a control basal diet containing endophyte-free (E-) tall fescue seed, control+carbon tetrachloride (CCL4), E+ tall fescue basal diet, E++CCl4, E-+TR, or E++TR. The diets were composed of 50% alfalfa meal, 34.5% rolled barley, 5% soybean meal, 4% cane molasses, 0.5% trace mineralized salt and 6% tall fescue (E- or E+) seed. In the 2 TR treatments 25% of the alfalfa was replaced by TR. Interaction between ergot alkaloids in E+ tall fescue and PA in TR was assessed by gamma glutamyl transferase (GGTP) activity and/or sulfobromophthalein (BSP) clearance rate, both of which measure liver function. Serum GGTP activity was measured on days 14 and 28, plasma BSP clearance was monitored on days 28 and 70 by collection of blood at 4, 8 and 16 min after iv BSP injection. Serum PRL assays were performed on days 14, 70 and 84. Serum GGTP activity was elevated by CCl4 drenching on days 14 and 28. On day 28 TR feeding reduced GGTP activity, but there was no difference between the 2 TR treatments. There was no difference in the mean BSP half-times (t( 1/2 )) and % BSP retentions on day 28 among any of the 6 treatments. On day 70, there was no difference in the t( 1/2 ) or % BSP retention 4 min after BSP injection among any of the treatments. At 8 min after BSP injection, however, % BSP retention was significantly higher for the control +CCl4 than for the E++CCl4 treatment. At 16 min after BSP injection, the E+ treatment had a higher mean % BSP retention value than the E++CCl4 treatment; there were no differences among the other treatments. Serum PRL levels were reduced by E+ or CCl4 on all 3 dates of PRL evaluation. The lack of interaction between ergot alkaloids in E+ tall rescue seed and PA in TR as assessed by GGTP activity and/or BSP clearance in sheep may imply that the target sites o the 2 alkaloids are metabolically different.

11766,Does a foliar endophyte improve plant fitness under flooding?,"Although endophytic fungi are ubiquitous in plants, their full range of ecological effects has yet to be characterized, particularly in non-agronomic systems. In this study, we compared the responses of two congeneric bluegrass species to flooding. Both plant species co-occur in subalpine zones of the Rocky Mountains. Marsh bluegrass (Poa leptocoma) commonly hosts a vertically transmitted fungal endophyte (EpichloA << sp.) and naturally grows in wetter conditions than does nodding bluegrass (Poa reflexa), which lacks an epichloid endophyte. We investigated the novel hypothesis that endophyte symbiosis promotes host fitness under flooded conditions, contributing to niche differentiation between the two bluegrass species. We used a factorial greenhouse experiment to test whether endophyte presence improved survival, growth, or reproduction of P. leptocoma under flooded versus non-flooded edaphic conditions by experimentally removing the endophyte from half of the plants. We compared P. leptocoma responses to those of the endophyte-free congener. In contrast to expectations generated from the natural distributions of the two plant species, endophyte presence was more beneficial to P. leptocoma under ambient soil moisture than under flooding. Increased benefits of symbiosis in drier soils are consistent with studies of other grass endophytes. Flooded soils also unexpectedly improved the growth of P. reflexa more than that of the wet habitat specialist, P. leptocoma. While our results demonstrate an overall benefit of fungal symbiosis in this system, ecological factors other than flooding per se likely underlie the observed geographical distributions of these congeneric grasses in nature.","Adams, AE; Kazenel, MR; Rudgers, JA",PLANT ECOLOGY,2017,10.1007/s11258-017-0723-0,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.683223606547912,TRUE,3,3,Medium,endophyte-free,observed; investigated,"endophyte from half of the plants.

Fertilization, however, did not override the strong, adverse effects of A. coenophialum on both aphid species. In field plots, densities of leafhoppers, flea beetles, and Staphylinidae were generally higher in fertilized than in nonfertilized turf. Flea beetles and two of the five most abundant species of leafhoppers were less numerous in endophyte-infected plots.

Individual trees displayed different levels of infection but branches within those trees had similar levels. There was a large difference in the infection levels between the two extant needle age-classes, with the youngest needles being virtually endophyte-free. Needles divided into four sections exhibited the most hyphal outgrowth from the distal portion and the least from the medial-proximal portion. Cultural morphotypes were primarily of the Lophodermium and Hormonema morphologies. Lophodermium occurred at all positions along the needle but Hormonema was restricted to the proximal and distal portions. Infrequently occurring fungi of diverse morphotypes were found at all four needle positions. A separate experiment compared levels of endophyte infection between Muskoka trees and trees growing in an urban area (Guelph, Ontario). Needle pieces from Guelph hosts had low rates of infection (0.02%) compared with needle pieces from Muskoka hosts (66.5%).

An endophyte fungus grows in the apoplast of aboveground tissues and is vertically transmitted through the seeds. Disinfecting plants or clones not only is useful as a way of eliminating a dangerous microorganism from cultivars, but also for experimental purposes. However, not all fungicides are effective, and if they are, a waiting period must be respected in order to avoid confounding effects of the endophyte and the treatment. We subjected plants (ramets from four genotypes) to different doses of two fungicides, Almagor® (Triazole + Imidazole) and Amistar® (Methoxy-acrylate), and evaluated the endophyte persistence. Fungicides were pipette-poured on pseudostems’ bases of each plant. Endophytic status was diagnosed in tillers that received the fungicide and in the new tillers produced by the plants and seeds. While Amistar® had no detectable effect, Almagor® was 100% effective at all doses. The latter interrupted the vertical-transmission processes (5400 evaluated seeds were endophyte-free). Phytotoxic effects were not observed in seeds. Proportion of normal and abnormal seedlings depended only on plant genotype. Almagor® was effective in stopping the fungus from growing into reproductive buds when apical meristems were down on the bases.

The effects of ergovaline in pastures can be aenuated through dilution; this is, to interseed infected tall fescue (E+) with legumes, endophyte-free grass, or with both. Plant interaction and ergovaline concentration in mixture of tall fescue (E+) and Lotus tenuis, a forage legume, were investigated in replacement series experiments under defoliation conditions. The interaction between species was analysed through relative yield total (RYT) of the forage biomass, aggressivity index (AI), plant cover and ergovaline concentration. The work was performed in field conditions. Six cuttings were applied during the experimental period. Plant monocultures of each species were at a constant density of 80 pl/m2, while mixtures ratios were 20:60, 40:40 and 60:20 pl/m2 of L. tenuis and tall fescue, respectively. Mortality of L. tenuis and tall fescue plants was not observed. Tall fescues yield and plant cover, in monoculture and in mixture, were higher than in L. tenuis. RYT was higher than 1 for all mixtures. According to AI, in mixture, tall fescue was the dominant species and overcompensated the lower yield of L. tenuis. At the early Autumn, ergovaline concentration in monoculture was 1.637±0.594 ng/g, and in the 40:40 mixture was 0.407±0.109 ng/g. Forage production was higher in mixtures than in monocultures, and L. tenuis contributed to reduce ergovaline concentration. According to the results, 40:40 pl/m2 of tall fescue and L. tenuis was the best species combination. A positive effect of L. tenuis on growth of tall fescue mediated by nitrogen availability could have allowed the plant coexistence.

In Petri dish preference trials, chinch bugs showed a preference for the CA endophyte (obtained from a Chewings fescue) over the RC endophyte (obtained from a strong creeping red fescue) in Chewings fescue selection C1117. Only the inoculated plants produced crogvaline, peramine, and lolitrem B; moreover, significant differences were found among the plant-endophyte combinations in the levels of these alkaloids.

To further elucidate the mechanism of resistance, we examined the behavioral response of adult and larval stages of T. tabaci to endophyte-inoculated (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) onion plants/sections. In choice experiments, female T. tabaci preferred E- over E+ plants. The number of feeding punctures and eggs was more on E- than on E+ plants. Oviposition was reduced sixfold on E+ plants within a 72-h experimental period. In the Y-tube olfactometer assay, thrips showed a 3.3-fold preference for E- plants. In individual larval choice experiments, significantly more first and second instars were found on the leaf sections of E- as compared to the E+ plants. In the settlement preference assay with groups of second instars, more larvae preferred leaf sections from E- over E+ plants with incremental time.

5734,Interactive effects of Epichloe fungal and host origins on the seed germination of Achnatherum inebrians,"Cool-season grasses have developed a symbiotic relationship with Epichloe endophytes. In many environments, Epichloe endophytes have been shown to be mutualistic symbionts of plants by increasing the fitness of their host against abiotic or biotic stresses. The effects of Epichloe endophytes on other fitness-correlated plant characteristics are less intensively studied, and the results are usually variable and contradictory. In this study, we evaluated the effects of endophyte infection on seed germination in Achnatherum inebrians from four origins. Our results indicate that the germination rate of the seeds collected from alpine regions was higher at low temperatures than that of seeds with desert and arid grassland origins. By contrast, a higher germination percentage was detected in seeds with desert and arid grassland origins than in those with alpine origins in higher temperatures. Epichloe endophyte infection affects the cardinal temperatures of seeds from different origins. Endophyte-infected seeds have a lower base temperature and a higher ceiling temperature than their endophyte-free counterparts. The value of the base temperature was higher in seeds with alpine grassland origins than in those with desert and arid grassland origins. However, the ceiling temperature was higher in seeds with desert and arid grassland origins than in those with alpine grassland origins.

10050,Nitrogen's influence on stockpiling of 'Jesup' tall fescue cultivars with diverse fungal endophyte presence,"Tall fescue [Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.) Dumort.] is used in the southern United States to extend the cow-calf grazing season during autumn and winter by stockpiling. However, livestock producers are reluctant to graze tall fescue because of the toxicity associated with the presence of an endophyte within the grass plant. In this study, the effects of the amount of N fertilizer rate (0, 50, and 100 acre(-1)), the N source (ammonium nitrate and urea), and the date of N application (September and October) were evaluated for the herbage accumulation (HA) and nutritive value on stockpiled tall fescue. The study was conducted in the autumn of 2007-2009 with six experimental 'Jesup' tall fescue cultivars with different endophytic fungal strains: endophyte-infected wild-type, endophyte-free, and infected with the novel endophytes (NE) AR502, AR514, AR542, and AR584. Greater HA was observed with the September N application. Ammonium nitrate was more efficient at increasing HA than urea at both N application rates. Herbage accumulation increased by 56 and 98% at 50 and 100 lb N acre(-1) compared with the control. The nutritive value of the stockpiled tall fescue declined as the winter season advanced, despite the source, rate, and timing of fertilizer application.

Twenty-four multiparous Holstein cows were randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups. Starting at 90±4 d prepartum, cows were fed endophyte-free fescue seed (control; CON), endophyte-free fescue seed plus 3×/wk subcutaneous injections of bromocriptine (0.1mg/kg of body weight, positive control; BROMO), or endophyte-infected fescue seed (INF) as 10% of the diet on an as fed basis. Although milk yield of groups did not differ before treatment, at dry off (-60 d prepartum) INF and BROMO cows produced less milk than CON. Throughout the treatment period, basal concentrations of PRL and the prepartum increase in plasma PRL were reduced in INF and BROMO cows compared with CON cows. Three weeks after the end of treatment, circulating concentrations of PRL were equivalent across groups. In the subsequent lactation milk yield was not decreased; in fact, BROMO cows exhibited a 9% increase in milk yield relative to CON.

Here we tested the effects of two phylotypes of Alternaria endophytes on the growth, competitive effects, and competitive responses of the exotic invasive forb Centaurea stoebe. Centaurea stoebe was a better competitor against North American grass species than grasses from its European home range in the absence of endophytes. However, one endophyte both increased the biomass of C. stoebe and reduced the competitive effect of North American grasses on C. stoebe.

5591,Endophytic infection increases the belowground over-yielding effects of the host grass community mainly by increasing the complementary effects,"IntroductionIncreases in plant species diversity may increase the community diversity effect and produce community over-yielding. Epichloe endophytes, as symbiotic microorganisms, are also capable of regulating plant communities, but their effects on community diversity effects are often overlooked. MethodsIn this experiment, we investigated the effects of endophytes on the diversity effects of host plant community biomass by constructing artificial communities with 1-species monocultures and 2- and 4-species mixtures of endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) Achnatherum sibiricum and three common plants in its native habitat, which were potted in live and sterilized soil. Results and discussionThe results showed that endophyte infection significantly increased the belowground biomass and abundance of Cleistogenes squarrosa, marginally significantly increased the abundance of Stipa grandis and significantly increased the community diversity (evenness) of the 4-species mixtures. Endophyte infection also significantly increased the over-yielding effects on belowground biomass of the 4-species mixtures in the live soil, and the increase in diversity effects on belowground biomass was mainly due to the endophyte significantly increasing the complementary effects on belowground biomass. The effects of soil microorganisms on the diversity effects on belowground biomass of the 4-species mixtures were mainly derived from their influences on the complementary effects. The effects of endophytes and soil microorganisms on the diversity effects on belowground biomass of the 4-species communities were independent, and both contributed similarly to the complementary effects on belowground biomass. The finding that endophyte infection promotes belowground over-yielding in live soil at higher levels of species diversity suggests that endophytes may be one of the factors contributing to the positive relationship between species diversity and productivity and explains the stable co-existence of endophyte-infected Achnatherum sibiricum with a variety of plants in the Inner Mongolian grasslands.","Qu, YB; Qin, TZ; Zhang, JZ; Deng, YK; Yu, XH; Wei, XQ; Zhao, NX; Gao, YB; Ren, AZ",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2023,10.3389/fpls.2023.1191904,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.972650202891368,TRUE,3,3,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS; investigated,"constructing artificial communities with 1-species monocultures and 2- and 4-species mixtures of endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) Achnatherum sibiricum and three common plants in its native habitat, which were potted in","4-species mixtures of endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) Achnatherum sibiricum and three common plants in its native habitat, which were potted in live and sterilized soil.

1404,Differences in the fly-load of Haematobia irritans (Diptera: Muscidae) on cattle is modified by endophyte infection of pastures,"Background: The horn fly, Haematobia irritans, is an obligate bloodsucking ectoparasite of pastured cattle and is a major pest of livestock production in North and South America and Europe. In this study, we investigated the potential to use cattle pastures, infected with non-toxic, ""friendly"" fungal-endophyte-infected (E+) tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea Schreb., as a strategy for reducing horn fly loads in cattle, and to evaluate the possible bioinsecticide effect on horn fly larvae. Results: When cattle grazed in E+ tall fescue, a decrease in fly-load was observed, compared with other pastures (endophyte-free (E-) pastures). The infestation of horn fly load decreased according to an increase in the percentage of endophyte present in the different pastures (0 to 100%). Moreover, two groups of animals with significant differences in the fly-load (high and low fly-load) in the same herd were observed (P < 0.05). Additionally, it was possible to determine a bioinsecticide effect of cattle dung, upon horn fly larvae (80%), from animals fed E+ tall fescue. Conclusions: These results constitute the first report on the potential for exploiting pasture management for controlling 1) horn fly-loads on cattle and 2) the normal development of horn fly larvae.

Experiments with different parasitoids that exploit the same host species feeding on the same plant may provide insight about how parasitoid life history affects the strength of such interactions. The encyrtid wasp Copidosoma bakeri, a slow-developing polyembryonic egg-larval parasitoid, and the tachinid fly Linnaemya comta, a fast-developing solitary species, both parasitize Agrotis ipsilon, a generalist noctuid. We tested the hypothesis that of the two parasitoid species, the encyrtid, because of its more prolonged developmental association with the host, would suffer greater fitness costs when A. ipsilon feeds on perennial ryegrass containing an alkaloid-producing fungal endophyte. Indeed, fewer parasitized cutworms yielded C. bakeri broods, and those host mummies were smaller, formed more slowly, and contained fewer adults when the hosts fed on endophytic as opposed to endophyte-free grass. In contrast, L. comta fitness parameters were similar regardless of the type of grass upon which their host fed.

However, re-inoculation of plants with non-toxic endophytes can result in positive effects for livestock feeding. Aims Assess the effects of the non-toxic AR584 endophyte on seed viability and germination in two tall fescue cultivars. Methods The effects of AR584 endophyte (presence/absence) and tall fescue cultivar (INIA Aurora/Taita) were evaluated on seed viability and germination responses across a range of temperature and water availability regimes. Response to constant temperature and water availability was characterised by the thermal-time and hydro-time models, respectively. Key results Under accelerated aging conditions, endophyte presence reduced seed viability in cultivar Taita. For both cultivars, endophyte-infected seeds showed a lower germination rate than endophyte-free seeds, except for INIA Aurora under low incubation temperatures. Also, endophyte-infected seeds in both cultivars displayed lower germination rates and final germination as the water potential was lowered. Conclusions A strong cultivar-by-endophyte interaction for seed germination indicates the need to understand how specific cultivar-endophyte combinations best fit a given environmental condition, as defined by temperature and water availability.

15440,Seed fungal endophytes promote the establishment of invasive Poa annua in maritime Antarctica,"Background: Invasive plants may displace native species. This is the case for Poa annua, the only non-native plant species successfully established in Maritime Antarctica. Nonetheless, it is uncertain which factors drive the competitive success of P. annua in the harsh environmental conditions of the region. The ability of this plant species to establish novel mutualistic interactions with resident soil fungi may be crucial for its invasiveness. Such ability may be linked to the vertical transmission of fungal endophytes via seeds. Aims: We undertook a study to assess the role of seed fungal endophytes as promoters of the establishment and invasion of Poa annua in Maritime Antarctica. Methods: We explored the composition and diversity of fungal communities associated with different P. annua tissues (seeds, leaves and roots) and the soil. We also measured parameters including germination rate, above-ground biomass, reproductive structures, and the survival of invasive P. annua as well as of the native Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica grown from seeds with and without endophytes. Furthermore, we conducted inter- and intraspecific competition experiments among native and invasive plants, where chemically mediated plant-to-plant interference (allelopathy) and plant growth rate were measured to calculate a relative competition index. Results: We found that fungal endophyte taxa associated with P. annua tissues were very different from those in the soil. Fungal endophytes in P. annua differed among seed, root and shoot tissues, which suggests low transmission among different organs. The removal of endophytes from P. annua seeds was associated with reduced seed germination, plant growth and survivorship, while the competitive ability of P. annua (assessed by accumulated biomass) relative to native species, as well as levels of allelochemicals in soils, were higher in the presence of seed fungal endophytes. Conclusion: Our results suggest that fungal endophytes, maternally inherited through seeds, improve host fitness and may contribute to the invasive success of P. annua in Antarctica. © 2022 Botanical Society of Scotland and Taylor & Francis.",Ballesteros G.I.; Acuña-Rodríguez I.S.; Barrera A.; Gundel P.E.; Newsham K.K.; Molina-Montenegro M.A.,Plant Ecology and Diversity,2022,10.1080/17550874.2022.2145579,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.772550261935005,TRUE,3,3,Medium,without endophytes,ITS; assessed,NA,plant species to establish novel mutualistic interactions with resident soil fungi may be crucial for its invasiveness.

18171,"Effect of consuming endophyte-infected fescue seed on transcript abundance in the mammary gland of lactating and dry cows, as assessed by RNA sequencing.","Ergot alkaloids in endophyte-infected grasses inhibit prolactin secretion and reduce milk production in lactating cows. However, we previously showed that prepartum consumption of infected seed throughout the dry period did not inhibit subsequent milk production and prior exposure to bromocriptine (ergot peptide) actually increased production in the next lactation. To identify changes in the transcriptome and molecular pathways mediating the mammary gland's response to ergot alkaloids in the diet, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on mammary tissues obtained from 22 multiparous Holstein cows exposed to 1 of 3 treatments. Starting at 90 ± 4 d prepartum, cows were fed endophyte-free fescue seed (control; CON), endophyte-free fescue seed plus 3×/wk subcutaneous injections of bromocriptine (BROMO; 0.1 mg/kg of BW), or endophyte-infected fescue seed (INF) as 10% of the diet. Cows were dried off 60 ± 2 d prepartum. Mammary biopsies from 4 (BROMO, INF) or 5 (CON) cows/treatment at each of the 3 phases were obtained: 7 d before dry off during the initial lactation (L1), mid-dry period (D), and 10 d postpartum (L2).

8694,Endophytic fungi in wild and cultivated grasses in Finland,"We examined the occurrence of vertically via host seeds transmitted endophyte infections of 14 grass species in natural populations in Finland and totally 97 agricultural cultivars of 13 grass species. Although endophyte infections were widespread in native grass species, overall endophyte occurrence and frequencies were lower than published reports have suggested. In natural populations, 10 out of 14 grass species examined harbor fungal endophytes in their seeds. The highest species-specific mean incidences of endophyte infected plants in infected populations were found in Agrostis capillaris, Festuca arundinacea, F. ovina, F. pratensis, F. rubra and Phleum pratense (67%, 98%, 29%, 42%, 32% and 33%, respectively). Mean incidences were <20% in Dactylis glomerata, Deschampsia flexuosa, D. cespitosa and Elymus repens, and no infections were detected in Calamagrostis lapponica, C. epigejos, Alopecurus pratensis and Phalaris arundinacea. However, we detected a very high variation in infection incidences among natural populations and a large proportion of populations was, indeed, endophyte-free. This supports the ideas that 1) endophytic fungi provide selective advantage of infected grasses to their uninfected conspecifics in some habitats, and/or 2) fungi are occasionally transmitted horizontally by spores.

19515,Sub-acute feeding study of a tall fescue endophyte in a perennial ryegrass host using mice.,"Epichloë endophytes in grass associations express a myriad of secondary metabolites which can affect the health of grazing animals and reduce the impact of insect pests on pasture. The ideal endophyte-grass association must have a favourable chemical profile such that the impact on animal health is minimised while the beneficial, deterrent effect on insect pests is maximised. A number of endophyte-perennial ryegrass associations have been successfully commercialised but research is on-going to further improve production in farming systems. Secondary metabolites expressed by endophyte-infected tall fescue include lolines, an animal-safe class of compound which imparts a potent effect on insects. Since endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass does not express lolines, a tall fescue endophyte, AR501, was inoculated into perennial ryegrass in an attempt to improve the insect resistance of this pasture type. In addition to animal safety, it is imperative that consideration is given to the safety of humans consuming animal products derived from livestock grazing the novel pasture. Although pure loline alkaloids have previously been tested on mice it is essential that the entire AR501 endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass matrix is tested since this will result in the exposure of both known and unknown secondary metabolites to mice. Three treatment groups each containing 6 male and 6 female mice were fed diets containing AR501 endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass seed (30%), perennial ryegrass seed containing no endophyte (30%) or a diet without seed (control) for 3 weeks. Mice fed control diet ate more than either of the treatment groups fed a diet containing seed. Male mice fed diet containing Nil endophyte seed ate more than those eating AR501 endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass seed although there was no difference observed in the food intake of female mice. While a few statistically significant differences were observed in the haematology and serum biochemical data, in every instance the difference was restricted to only one gender so is considered unlikely to be of toxicological significance. Mice fed AR501 endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass seed remained healthy throughout the experimental period despite consuming 62,000 mg/kg lolines and 4600 mg/kg peramine per day as well as the wide array of other unknown secondary metabolites expressed by this endophyte.

12168,Reduced herbivore resistance from a novel grass-endophyte association,"1. Endophytic fungi in agricultural grasses confer agronomic advantages but can be detrimental to the health and production of grazing mammals. Attempts have been made to resolve this dilemma by creating novel associations of high-yielding grass cultivars and 'safe endophytes' that do not naturally co-occur. Recently, researchers created a novel association by combining a Moroccan strain of Neotyphodium coenophialum, called AR542, with the tall fescue Festuca arundinacea cultivar Georgia 5. This novel association is marketed commercially and has no doubt become naturalized; it is therefore important to assess its impact on other organisms. 2. The bird-cherry-oat aphid Rhopalosiphum padi uses tall fescue as an alternative host. We assessed the performance of R. padi feeding on Georgia 5 that had been artificially infected with AR542, naturally infected by the common strain (CS) of N. coenophialum or was endophyte-free (EF). We cross-factored these three levels of endophyte infection with four levels of nitrogen fertilizer, and used two different methods of assessing aphid performance, clip-cages and enclosed populations. 3. Endophyte-infected plants produced approximately 20% more dry mass than EF plants. In both the clip-cage and enclosed-population experiments, aphid populations grew fastest on the EF plants, slower on AR542-infected plants and slowest (or not at all) on the CS-infected plants. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that AR542 infection does not provide the same degree of protection from aphids as the commonly occurring CS infection. If similar results are found for other invertebrate herbivores, then the use of this novel endophyte association may be less useful than previously thought. The widespread conversion of tall fescue pastures, currently infected with the CS endophyte, to pastures infected with AR542 could result in a general increase in the prevalence of cereal aphids and, potentially, the diseases that they spread. However, such conversion might be beneficial to native invertebrate herbivores.","Hunt, MG; Newman, JA",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,2005,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01061.x,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.732898389211905,TRUE,3,3,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS; assessed,"infected with AR542, naturally infected by the common strain (CS) of N. coenophialum or was endophyte-free (EF).

19198,Epichloë Endophyte Enhanced Insect Resistance of Host Grass Leymus Chinensis by Affecting Volatile Organic Compound Emissions.,"In plant-herbivore interactions, plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play an important role in anti-herbivore defense. Grasses and Epichloë endophytes often form defensive mutualistic symbioses. Most Epichloë species produce alkaloids to protect hosts from herbivores, but there is no strong evidence that endophytes can affect the insect resistance of their hosts by altering VOC emissions. In this study, a native dominant grass, sheepgrass (Leymus chinensis), and its herbivore, oriental migratory locust (Locusta migratoria), were used as experimental materials. We studied the effect of endophyte-associated VOC emissions on the insect resistance of L. chinensis. The results showed that endophyte infection enhanced insect resistance of the host, and locusts preferred the odor of endophyte-free (EF) leaves to that of endophyte-infected (EI) leaves. We determined the VOC profile of L. chinensis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and found that endophyte infection decreased the pentadecane (an alkane) emission from uneaten plants, and increased the nonanal (an aldehyde) emission from eaten plants. The olfactory response experiment showed that locusts were attracted by high concentration of pentadecane, while repelled by high concentration of nonanal, indicating that Epichloë endophytes may increase locust resistance of L. chinensis by decreasing pentadecane while increasing nonanal emission. Our results suggest that endophytes can induce VOC-mediated defense in hosts in addition to producing alkaloids, contributing to a better understanding the endophyte-plant-herbivore interactions.",Deng Y; Yu X; Yin J; Chen L; Zhao N; Gao Y; Ren A,Journal of chemical ecology,2024,10.1007/s10886-023-01459-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.908255501868771,TRUE,3,3,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS; studied,"that endophyte infection enhanced insect resistance of the host, and locusts preferred the odor of endophyte-free (EF) leaves to that of endophyte-infected (EI) leaves.

467,Effects of endophytic fungi on the secondary metabolites of Hordeum bogdanii under alkaline stress,"It is currently unclear whether the mechanism of endophytic fungi improving the alkali tolerance of Hordeum bogdanii affects secondary metabolites. Unveiling this knowledge is crucial for understanding the tolerance mechanism of H. bogdanii to alkaline stress. The aim of this study was to investigate how endophytic fungi affect secondary metabolites of H. bogdanii under alkaline stress at different concentrations. Endophyte-infected (E +) and endophyte-free (E-) individuals of H. bogdanii were used as materials in this study. The method of indoor vermiculite aseptic planting was adopted. After mixed alkali stress treatment, the roots, stems, and leaves of the plants were collected to measure the indicators related to secondary metabolites. The results showed that endophytic fungi improved the alkali resistance of H. bogdanii by improving the related indicators of secondary metabolites. endophytic fungi significantly increased the contents of phosphorus, polyphenols, and alkaloids, and the activities of polyphenol oxidase and acid phosphatase, and significantly reduced flavonoid content. The content of polyphenols and alkaloids in stems, polyphenol oxidase activity in stems and leaves, and acid phosphatase activity in leaves were significantly affected. The findings of this study may aid in amplifying the alkali resistance mechanism of endophytic fungi to H. bogdanii as well as provide insights into improving the alkali resistance of other plants.","Han, D; Wang, K; Long, F; Zhang, WB; Yao, X; Chen, SH",AMB EXPRESS,2022,10.1186/s13568-022-01414-w,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.897153774050039,TRUE,3,3,Medium,endophyte-free,aseptic; collected,secondary metabolites of H. bogdanii under alkaline stress at different concentrations.

16633,A model of fescue toxicosis: responses of rats to intake of endophyte-infected tall fescue.,"A study was conducted to develop a model for fescue toxicosis using rats fed a diet containing endophyte-infected tall fescue seed (E+). Rats implanted with telemetric transmitters to continuously monitor core body temperature (Tc) and activity were housed at thermoneutrality (21 degrees C) and were fed a diet containing endophyte-free fescue seed (E-). After 2 wk, they were assigned to either E+ or E- diets and initially maintained at thermoneutrality (preheat) for 8 d. They were then exposed to heat stress (31 degrees C) for 22 d, followed by 1 wk of recovery at thermoneutrality (post-heat). Body weight and feed intake were measured daily. Rats receiving the E+ diet showed decreased feed intake (P = 0.001) and weight gains (P = 0.003) during the preheat period. The decrease in Tc from the pre-treatment level was greater in E+ than in E- rats during the preheat (P = 0.001) and postheat (P = 0.001) periods. With heat stress, both groups showed parallel decreases in feed intake. The increase in Tc from pre-heat to heat conditions was greater in E+ vs. E- rats (P = 0.001). Activity level was lower in E+ than in E-rats during heat stress (P = 0.009) and postheat (P = 0.037) periods.

1153,Phosphorus induced changes in food quality enhance porina fitness feeding on Epichloë endophyte free forage grasses,"The increasing expenses and environmental repercussions associated with phosphorus (P) fertiliser underscore the necessity for precision-managed application methods. These changes affect pastoral systems, where cool-season grasses like perennial ryegrass and meadow fescue form beneficial relationships with Epichlo & euml; endophytes. Understanding how fertilisers influence these endophytes, host grasses, and insect pests is crucial, as Epichlo & euml; endophytes enhance resistance to some herbivorous insects. This study examined the indirect impact of various P fertiliser regimes on cool-season grasses, which serve as food sources for porina larvae (Wiseana copularis), a significant pasture pest in New Zealand. Endophyte-infected (Epichlo & euml; sp. LpTG-3 strain AR37) perennial ryegrass and meadow fescue infected with E. uncinata (strain MaxR (AR1017)), alongside their endophyte-free counterparts were grown in P-enriched soil with varying Olsen P levels (9, 18, 28, and 78 mg/L). Freeze-dried foliage was added to semi-synthetic diets and fed to porina larvae in a no-choice assay. Measurements included diet consumption, porina survival, weight gain. Measurements in foliage included fungal alkaloid concentration, fungal biomass, and plant nutrient levels. Endophyte infection of AR37 and MaxR significantly reduced porina diet consumption, larval weight gain and survival irrespective of soil Olsen P levels to the plant. Loline alkaloid concentration in MaxR-infected herbage increased with increasing soil Olsen P levels while fungal mass remained unchanged. In endophyte-free grasses, porina larvae significantly increased their diet consumption, weight gain and survival as the Olsen P level available to the host plant increased. While endophyte strains AR37 and MaxR continue to protect their hosts under different Olsen P regimes, these results suggest that the improved performance of porina on endophyte-free plants is largely driven by P-induced changes in food quality. Here, we discuss the implications of porina damage in New Zealand pastures in the context of decreasing P availability.","Hewitt, KG; Hofmann, RW; Ball, OJ; Finch, SC; Bryant, RH; Popay, AJ",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2025,10.1038/s41598-025-89723-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.984566528308874,TRUE,3,3,Medium,endophyte-free,examined; examined,"AR37) perennial ryegrass and meadow fescue infected with E. uncinata (strain MaxR (AR1017)), alongside their endophyte-free counterparts were grown in P-enriched soil with varying Olsen P levels (9, 18, 28, and","is crucial, as Epichlo & euml; endophytes enhance resistance to some herbivorous insects.

12129,PHYSIOLOGICAL-RESPONSES IN RATS FED EXTRACTS OF ENDOPHYTE INFECTED TALL FESCUE SEED,"Three trials involving 184 male Sprague Dawley rats were conducted to identify the biologically active fraction of endophyte-infected tall fescue seed. In trial 1, seed infected (>95%)with the endophytic fungus Acremonium coenophialum and shown to be toxic to cattle, was serially extracted with hexane, ethylacetate, and methanol, respectively. A second sample of this seed was extracted with chloroform only. Controls included a solvent treatment (spraying the various solvents on endophyte-free seed and carrying the mixture to dryness), the seed post-extraction, endophyte-infected seed and endophyte-free seed.

Trial 3 examined the methanol fraction extracted serially, a methanol fraction extracted batchwise, and a water fraction extracted batchwise. Controls included seed residues postextraction, solvent residue from methanol sprayed on endophyte-free seed, and endophyte-infected seed. Lowered feed intake and weight gains, and depressed serum prolactin concentrations were used as indicators of toxicity. Feed intake was lower in all three trials for rats fed the methanol fraction. In all three trials mean serum prolactin concentrations in rats fed the methanol extracts were not different from those fed endophyte-infected fescue seed. Rats fed the water extract in trial 3 had lower feed intakes than rats fed endophyte-free seed. However, rats fed the seed, post-water extraction, had serum prolactin concentrations similar to that of the negative control.

10022,Epichloeendophyte modifies the foliar anatomy ofLolium multiflorumLam.,"Systemic fungal endophytes may increase the adaptive potential of their hosts to different environmental conditions. However, the mechanisms involved in the adjustment are still an area of active inquiry. Considering that anatomical features in plants are the result of adaptation to different environments, this aspect of plants response to the symbionts deserves further research. In this work we investigated whether an asexualEpichloeendophyte modifies the foliar anatomy of symbiotic plants (E+) of its host grass with respect to endophyte-free plants (E-), using theEpichloe occultans-Lolium multiflorumsystem. The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse and plants were grown under benign, non-stressful (controlled) conditions. Symbiotic plants showed thinner leaf blades and lower mesophyll thickness. Likewise, the endophyte is associated with a greater number of vascular bundles. The stomatal density on the lower epidermis was higher in symbiotic plants than non-symbiotic plants. Our study reveals thatEpichloe occultansmodifies the foliar anatomy ofLolium multiflorum.

14436,Effects of fungal endophytes on properties and microbial community structure of the rhizosphere soil of Achnatherum sibiricum in nitrogen addition conditions,"Simultaneous infections of host plants with endophytic fungi are common in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Endophyte-infected (E+) grasses may differ in chemical composition and root exudates from endophyte-free (E-) individuals, and these differences may indirectly affect soil properties and microbial communities in the host grass habitat. In this study, we used as plant material Achnatherum sibiricum, a native grass, naturally infected with two species of endophytes, including Epichloë sibirica and E. gansuensis. E. gansuensis has two morphotypes, E. gansuensis-1 and E. gansuensis-2,of which E. gansuensis-1 exhibits strict vertical transmission, while E. gansuensis-2 can be transmitted vertically as well as horizontally. The objective of this study was to explore the effect of endophyte infection, endophyte species, nitrogen availability, and maternal plant genotype on the physicochemical properties and microbial communities of soil in the A. sibiricum habitat. At the end of a pot experiment, we analyzed the soil total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), determined soil pH, and estimated the soil C mineralization. Soil microbial biomass and community composition were assayed by using the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) technique. In the present study, we found that the soil pH value differed significantly between the E+ and E- treatments (E+ > E-). In addition, the soil pH was influenced by endophyte species: pH in the E. sibirica-infected condition was higher than that in the E. gansuense-1 infected condition, but the difference was not significant with the E. gansuense-2 condition. Endophyte infection significantly improved the total amount of rhizosphere microorganisms but reduced soil bacterial:fungal ratio. Endophyte status and species, nitrogen addition, and maternal plant genotype had no significant effects on soil total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), rhizosphere microorganisms and C mineralization ability. This study suggested that endophyte infection could alter soil pH and microbial community structure, and endophytic fungi may change soil total C and N with more available nitrogen or in the long-term.

503,Natural enemies act faster than endophytic fungi in population control of cereal aphids,"Fast-growing populations of phytophagous insects can be limited by the presence of natural enemies and by alkaloids that are produced by symbiotic associations of many temperate grass species with endophytic fungi. It is unclear if and how acquired plant defences derived from endophytic fungi interact with natural enemies to affect phytophagous insect populations. To assess the relative importance of endophytic fungi compared to that of natural enemies on the population dynamics of phytophagous insects, we carried out a fully factorial field experiment, in which the presence of natural enemies and the presence of endophytic fungi were manipulated simultaneously. Target colonies of aphids were monitored for 8 weeks starting from their natural appearance in the field to the end of the aphid season. We show that on Lolium perenne increased natural enemy densities reduced the individual numbers of two common cereal aphids, Rhopalosiphum padi and Metopolophium festucae. The presence of the endophytic fungi Neotyphodium lolii reduced the number of M. festucae but did not affect the number of R. padi. The reduction in R. padi numbers by predators and parasitoids was not influenced by the presence of endophytes. For adult M. festucae, however, the negative effects of natural enemies were significant only in the absence of endophytes. Over the duration of the experiment, the effect of natural enemies on aphid colony growth was much stronger than the effect of the endophytic fungi N. lolii, presumably because predator and parasitoid action on aphid colonies is much faster than any effects of endophytes. Our results demonstrate that with simultaneous action of acquired endosymbionts and natural enemies, both factors can control aphid colony growth but they generally act independently of each other.","Härri, SA; Krauss, J; Müller, CB",JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,2008,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01373.x,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.751789184181445,TRUE,3,3,Medium,absence of endophytes,colony; monitored,NA,"of endophytes.

In transcriptome analysis of the pseudostems (leaf sheath whorls), differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were defined as having at least twofold expression difference and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 in comparisons of water treatment (stressed or watered), endophyte presence or absence, or both. Stress affected 38% of the plant transcripts including those for the expected stress-response pathways. The DEGs affected by endophyte in stressed plants were unique to individual plant genotypes. In unstressed plants, endophyte presence tended to reduce expression of genes putatively for defense against fungi, but in unstressed P27 endophyte presence there was enhanced expression of dehydrin and heat shock protein genes. Our results indicated subtle and variable effects of endophytes on tall fescue gene expression; where the endophyte confers protection, its effects on plant gene expression may help prime the plant for stress resistance.","Dinkins, RD; Nagabhyru, P; Young, CA; West, CP; Schardl, CL",PLANT GENOME,2019,10.3835/plantgenome2018.09.0071,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.92969196773329,TRUE,3,3,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS; evaluated,(NTE19) and one with another Epichloe species (FaTG-4) were evaluated and compared with their respective endophyte-free clones for responses to water-deficit stress in the greenhouse.

1142,The Effects of Endophytes on Seed Production and Seed Predation of Tall Fescue and Meadow Fescue,"Fungal endophytes of grasses are often included in agricultural management and in ecological studies of natural grass populations. In European agriculture and ecological studies, however, grass endophytes are largely ignored. In this study, we determined endophyte infection frequencies of 13 European cultivars and 49 wild tall fescue (Sehedonorus phoenix) populations in Northern Europe. We then examined seed production and seed predation of endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E) tall fescue (in wild grass populations and in a field experiment) and meadow fescue (Schedonorus pratensis; in a field experiment only). Endophytes were detected in only one of the 13 cultivars. In contrast, >90% of wild tall fescue plants harbored endophytes in 45 wild populations but were absent in three inland populations in Estonia. In three wild tall fescue study sites, 17%, 22%, and 56% of the seeds were preyed upon by the cocksfoot moth. Endophyte infection did not affect seed mass of tall fescue in the field experiment. However, seed predation was lower in E+ than E grasses in the two tall fescue populations with higher predation rates. For meadow fescue, the mean number of seeds from E+ plants was higher than E plants, but E and E+ seeds had equal rates of predation by the moth.

10774,Fungal reduce endophyte removal does not cold tolerance of tall fescue,"Tall fescue [Schenodorus phoenix (Scop.) Holub.] has historically been of minor importance to livestock agriculture in cooler regions of the temperate zone. As its use in these regions expands, it becomes increasingly important to understand the effect of infection by its fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum Morgan-Jones and Gams) on agronomic fitness of tall fescue. Our objective was to determine the effect of endophyte infection status on forage yield and survival of tall fescue under field conditions in which freezing temperatures, combined with lack of persistent snow cover, constitute the most significant stress factor. In Experiment 1, we evaluated 427 half-sib families of four tall fescue cultivars, half endophyte-infected (E+) and half endophyte-free (E-), for forage yield and survival. There was no effect of endophyte removal on either forage yield or survival, despite complete stand loss of one cultivar during two winters. In Experiment 2, we evaluated 640 clones of confirmed endophyte status, half E+ and half E-, for survival under two management regimes at four Wisconsin locations. Results were nearly identical to those for Experiment 1, with complete mortality in the unadapted cultivar and high survival rates in the three adapted cultivars, regardless of endophyte status, management, or location. In conclusion, we found no evidence that endophyte removal resulted in any disadvantage to tall fescue host-plant survival under harsh winter conditions. In regions where freezing temperatures and desiccating winds provide the only or most important abiotic stress factor, removal of endophytic fungi do not appear to reduce fitness of their tall fescue host.","Casler, MD; van Santen, E",CROP SCIENCE,2008,10.2135/cropsci2007.11.0615,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.988544882729861,TRUE,3,3,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS; evaluated,"we evaluated 427 half-sib families of four tall fescue cultivars, half endophyte-infected (E+) and half endophyte-free (E-), for forage yield and survival.

5642,Effects of feeding endophyte-infected fescue seed on reproductive traits of male mice divergently selected for resistance or susceptibility to fescue toxicosis,"Our objective was to determine whether consumption of endophyte-infected fescue seed affected male reproduction differently in a mouse line previously selected for susceptibility (S) to fescue toxicosis than in a line previously selected for fescue toxicosis resistance (R). For 8 weeks following weaning, 48 males per line were provided diets containing 50% of either endophyte-infected (E+) or endophyte-free (E-) fescue seed. Each male was then paired with a female for 1 week, with litter size and weight recorded from subsequent births. Males were then killed, testes and seminal vesicles were weighed, cauda epididymal sperm were collected and testis cross-sections were fixed. The E+ diet reduced litter size by 0.5 in mates of S males but increased it by 1.0 in mates of R males (line by diet interaction P = 0.05). Testis traits were not affected by diet or the line by diet interaction. Sperm integrity was adversely affected by the E+ diet (P < 0.01) but did not differ significantly between lines, nor were line by diet interactions important. In earlier work, the E+ diet reduced long-term reproduction by a larger amount in S- than in R-line mated pairs. Because the E+ diet had similar effects on reproductive traits in R and S males in the current experiment, we infer that the differential impact previously reported acted primarily through traits expressed in females.

1256,Insect oviposition preference between Epichloe-symbiotic and Epichloe-free grasses does not necessarily reflect larval performance,"Variation in plant communities is likely to modulate the feeding and oviposition behavior of herbivorous insects, and plant-associated microbes are largely ignored in this context. Here, we take into account that insects feeding on grasses commonly encounter systemic and vertically transmitted (via seeds) fungal Epichloe endophytes, which are regarded as defensive grass mutualists. Defensive mutualism is primarily attributable to alkaloids of fungal origin. To study the effects of Epichloe on insect behavior and performance, we selected wild tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) and red fescue (Festuca rubra) as grass-endophyte models. The plants used either harbored the systemic endophyte (E+) or were endophyte-free (E-). As a model herbivore, we selected the Coenonympha hero butterfly feeding on grasses as larvae. We examined both oviposition and feeding preferences of the herbivore as well as larval performance in relation to the presence of Epichloe endophytes in the plants. Our findings did not clearly support the female's oviposition preference to reflect the performance of her offspring. First, the preference responses depended greatly on the grass-endophyte symbiotum. In F. arundinacea, C. hero females preferred E+ individuals in oviposition-choice tests, whereas in F. rubra, the endophytes may decrease exploitation, as both C. hero adults and larvae preferred E- grasses. Second, the endophytes had no effect on larval performance. Overall, F. arundinacea was an inferior host for C. hero larvae. However, the attraction of C. hero females to E+ may not be maladaptive if these plants constitute a favorable oviposition substrate for reasons other than the plants' nutritional quality. For example, rougher surface of E+ plant may physically facilitate the attachment of eggs, or the plants offer greater protection from natural enemies. Our results highlight the importance of considering the preference of herbivorous insects in studies involving the endophyte-symbiotic grasses as host plants.","Laihonen, M; Saikkonen, K; Helander, M; Tammaru, T",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2020,10.1002/ece3.6450,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985073219740617,TRUE,3,3,Medium,endophyte-free,examined; examined,"rubra) as grass-endophyte models.

10270,Occurrence and genetic structure of the systemic grass endophyte Epichloe festucae in fine fescue populations,"Epichloe species are systemic fungal endophytes that usually specialize in a certain group of related grass species. We examined the infection frequency of Epichloe festucae in populations of two fine fescue species (Festuca rubra and F. ovina) in natural and seminatural habitats at 86 study sites (total = 2514 plants) across Finland and northern Norway. Infection incidence varied significantly among grass species and populations. A substantial number of the F. rubra and F. ovina populations (53 out of 77 and 25 out of 30, respectively) were either endophyte-free or had very low (< 20%) infection frequencies. The highest infection frequencies were found in subarctic areas. Moreover, infection incidence differed between habitats. In the area with the highest infection frequencies, we used microsatellite markers to study genetic diversity and the rates of gene flow of E. festucae among 12 F. rubra populations. Twenty out of the 25 fungal genotypes detected with four microsatellite markers were carrying multiple alleles in at least one locus, indicating multiple infections or vegetative hybridization of the fungus. One dominant genotype occurred in all 12 populations, representing 63.5% of all isolates. We found a moderate level of average genotypic variation and a low level of genetic differentiation (F-st = 0.0814). There was no correlation between infection frequency and genotypic diversity. Although the existence of a dominant genotype and the detected linkage disequilibrium suggest that the fungus is mainly asexual and vertically transmitted, the multiallelic loci and variation of genetic diversity among populations indicate occasional contagious spread and sexual or parasexual recombination of the fungus in some populations. Furthermore, the genotypes carrying multiallelic loci suggest the possibility of multiple infections or hybridization of the endophyte.","Wäli, PR; Ahlholm, JU; Helander, M; Saikkonen, K",MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,2007,10.1007/s00248-006-9076-2,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.968656633417914,TRUE,3,3,Medium,endophyte-free,examined; examined,"F. ovina populations (53 out of 77 and 25 out of 30, respectively) were either endophyte-free or had very low (< 20%) infection frequencies.

3308,Selection for persistence in endophyte-free Kentucky 31 tall fescue,"'Kentucky 31', released in 1943, remains the most widely used tall fescue cultivar (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). The fungal endophyte, Neotyphodium coenophialum (Morgan-Jones & Gams.) Glenn, Bacon & Hanlin comb. nov., which naturally infects Kentucky 31, enhances survival and competitiveness of the grass. However, cattle grazing forage from endophyte-infected (E+) Kentucky 31 suffer from fescue toxicity because of alkaloids in the forage. A possible strategy to reduce fescue toxicity is cultivar improvement to develop more persistent endophyte-free (E-) cultivars. The objective of our research was to assess the results of selection with different levels of stress (grazing and competition with bermudagrass, Cynodon dactylon L.) to increase persistence and competitiveness within E- Kentucky 31. Populations were selected in the following environments: (i) seeded into bermudagrass and grazed with continuously stocked beef cattle, (ii) seeded into bermudagrass and clipped intermittently with a mower, (iii) seeded into tilled soil and grazed with continuously stocked beef cattle, and (iv) seeded into tilled soil and clipped intermittently with a mower. Populations were developed from the best surviving plants in each selection condition and tested for grazing persistence and competitiveness with bermudagrass. Grazing, especially when combined with bermudagrass competition, created the greatest reduction of persistence. No selected population was found to survive better than E- Kentucky 31 even when tested in the same conditions used during its selection. The E+ checks were the most persistent entries in all testing conditions.

Endophyte-infected (EI) and endophyte-free (EF) clones of 13 L. perenne genotypes, collected from native habitats with stressful environmental conditions, were evaluated in a field experiment for symbiotic effects on plant growth (herbage yield, reproductive tiller number), seed production, and seed quality parameters [1000-seed weight (TSW), germination] over 3 yr in an area with low rainfall (Halle, Germany). The results revealed high variability in endophyte effects on the investigated parameters. In seven genotypes, endophyte presence improved plant growth and seed production during the first harvest year. However, in four of these genotypes, endophyte effects were reversed in the following harvests. In the remaining six genotypes, endophyte infection reduced plant performance. The impact of the fungus on TSW was inconsistent, while seed germination was either improved or not affected by the endophyte. A positive endophyte effect was detectable for genotypes with low performance of EF clones, whereas genotypes with high-yield EF clones were not, or negatively, affected by the endophyte. Genotypes originating from sites exposed to flooding and periodic drought showed consistent negative endophyte effects on herbage yield and seed production. Since reduced shoot growth is a drought avoidance mechanism, further studies are needed to determine whether endophytes in these genotypes improve adaptation to drought, or represent a ""metabolic cost."" Our results indicate that some Neotyphodium endophytes have the potential to improve plant performance of L. perenne, but the selection of strains with consistent beneficial effects on plant growth is difficult.","Hesse, U; Hahn, H; Andreeva, K; Förster, K; Warnstorff, K; Schöberlein, W; Diepenbrock, W",CROP SCIENCE,2004,10.2135/cropsci2004.1689,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.955993023422984,TRUE,3,3,Medium,endophyte-free,investigated; collected; evaluated,"improve plant growth and seed yield of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.).

2046,A mutualistic endophyte alters the niche dimensions of its host plant,"Mutualisms can play important roles in influencing species coexistence and determining community composition. However, few studies have tested whether such interactions can affect species distributions by altering the niches of partner species. In subalpine meadows of the Rocky Mountains, USA, we explored whether the presence of a fungal endophyte (genus Epichloe) may shift the niche of its partner plant, marsh bluegrass (Poa leptocoma) relative to a closely related but endophyte-free grass species, nodding bluegrass (Poa reflexa). Using observations and a 3-year field experiment, we tested two questions: (i) Do P. leptocoma and P. reflexa occupy different ecological niches? and (ii) Does endophyte presence affect the relative fitness of P. leptocoma versus P. reflexa in the putative niches of these grass species? The two species were less likely to co-occur than expected by chance. Specifically, P. leptocoma grew closer to water sources and in wetter soils than P. reflexa, and also had higher root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi. Endophyte-symbiotic P. leptocoma seeds germinated with greater frequency in P. leptocoma niches relative to P. reflexa niches, whereas neither endophyte-free (experimentally removed) P. leptocoma seeds nor P. reflexa seeds showed differential germination between the two niche types. Thus, endophyte presence constrained the germination and early survival of host plants to microsites occupied by P. leptocoma. However, endophyte-symbiotic P. leptocoma ultimately showed greater growth than endophyte-free plants across all microsites, indicating a net benefit of the symbiosis at this life history stage. Differential effects of endophyte symbiosis on different host life history stages may thus contribute to niche partitioning between the two congeneric plant species. Our study therefore identifies a symbiotic relationship as a potential mechanism facilitating the coexistence of two species, suggesting that symbiont effects on host niche may have community-level consequences.","Kazenel, MR; Debban, CL; Ranelli, L; Hendricks, WQ; Chung, YA; Pendergast, TH; Charlton, ND; Young, CA; Rudgers, JA",AOB PLANTS,2015,10.1093/aobpla/plv005,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.874681672912136,TRUE,3,3,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS; tested,"niche of its partner plant, marsh bluegrass (Poa leptocoma) relative to a closely related but endophyte-free grass species, nodding bluegrass (Poa reflexa).

This study examined the effect of drought on root aphid populations and plant performance in perennial ryegrass plants relative to endophyte status (+/-) and endophyte strain (AR37, NZ(CT)) in a glasshouse experiment. Plants were cloned across the drought and well-watered treatments, and half of the plants were inoculated with root aphids, whilst half of the plants were treated with insecticide. Endophyte infection with strain NZ(CT) and AR37 reduced root aphid numbers. Aphid populations were significantly higher in drought-stressed than in well-watered plants in both endophyte-infected and endophyte-free treatments. Under drought conditions, root aphid populations were increased 4-fold in NZ(CT) and 8-fold in AR37 and endophyte-free plants in comparison with their well-watered counterparts. Root aphids reduced shoot dry weight by 16% in drought-exposed and 26% in well-watered plants in comparison with their insecticide-treated counterparts whilst reducing root biomass by 49%. Our results suggest that root aphids are likely able to exploit the higher availability of amino acids in the plant sap of drought-exposed plants. This study provides evidence that climate change-mediated impacts of root aphids could reduce production in perennial ryegrass-dominant pastures. However, field trials would be necessary to determine whether this effect is seen in situ, where numerous additional factors will be operating at the same time.","Hewitt, KG; Hofmann, RW; Ball, OJ; Cox, N; Bryant, RH; Finch, SC; Popay, AJ",JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE,2024,10.1007/s10340-023-01630-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.858597066376867,TRUE,3,3,Medium,endophyte-free,examined; examined,"against root aphids and greater resilience under drought, contributing to higher persistency and growth than endophyte-free plants.

842,Contrasting effects of Rhizophagus irregularis versus bacterial and fungal seed endophytes on Trifolium repens plant-soil feedback,"Interactions between plants and soil affect plant-plant interactions and community composition by modifying soils conditions in plant-soil feedback, where associated microbes have the most crucial role. Both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and microbial seed endophytes have been demonstrated to influence, directly or indirectly, biotic or abiotic soil properties, thus affecting subsequent plant growth, and community structure. However, little is known about how plant endophyte communities, individually or in interaction with AMF, affect plant-soil feedback processes. Here, we investigated, through a manipulative experiment, the behavior of endophyte-free and endophyte-associated Trifolium repens plants grown in soils previously conditioned by conspecific endophyte-free and endophyte-associated plants, inoculated or not by Rhizophagus intraradices. Furthermore, we identified microbial endophytes directly from the inner tissues of seeds by high-throughput sequencing, to compare seed fungal and bacterial endophyte composition. Results demonstrated that the outcome of simultaneous occurrence of seed endophytes and AMF on plant behavior depended on matching the endophytic status, i.e., either the presence or absence of seed microbial endophytes, of the conditioning and response phase. Seed fungal endophytes generated strong conspecific negative feedback, while seed bacterial endophytes proved to shift the feedback from negative to positive. Moreover, the simultaneous occurrence of both seed endophytes with AMF could either generate or expand negative plant-soil feedback effects. Our results show that seed and root symbionts can play a significant role on setting conspecific plant-soil feedback.","Idbella, M; Bonanomi, G; De Filippis, F; Amor, G; Chouyia, FE; Fechtali, T; Mazzoleni, S",MYCORRHIZA,2021,10.1007/s00572-020-01003-4,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.601424601406339,TRUE,3,3,Medium,endophyte-free,sequencing; investigated,"AMF, affect plant-soil feedback processes.

20765,The influence of watering conditions on endophyte infection level of meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis) by Neotyphodium uncinatum,"This study is devoted to the problem of fungal distribution in individual plants. We used seeds of meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds.) cultivar VIK 5 infected with Neotyphodium uncinatum (W. Gams, Petrini et D. Schmidt) Glenn, C W. Bacon et Hanlin. Draught conditions increased the part of infected plants got from infected seeds. The part of non-infected plants significantly differed in the cases of draught and humid conditions (40 and 57 % non-infected plants respectively). Some plants had both infected and non-infected tillers. This fact verified the possibility of non-systemic infection. It seems that an infected seedling has a choice between forming infected and non-infected til-lers. In some conditions the program can change, so researcher will observe «elimination» of endophyte or its «appearance», but perhaps it will mean just activation or inactivation of endophyte.

16879,Performance of growing cattle grazing stockpiled Jesup tall fescue with varying endophyte status.,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of growing cattle when intensively grazing stockpiled endophyte-infected (E+), endophyte-free (E-), and nontoxic endophyte-infected (EN) tall fescue during the winter. The experiment was conducted over 5 consecutive winters. In each year, plots (1 ha each, 4 per treatment) were harvested for hay in August, fertilized in September, and forage was allowed to accumulate until grazing was initiated in early December. Each year, 48 Angus-cross tester cattle (4 per plot) were given a daily allotment of forage, under strip-grazing (frontal grazing) management, with a target residual height of 5 cm. Steers were used the first year, and heifers were used in subsequent years. The grazing periods for determination of pasture ADG were 86 d (yr 1), 70 d (yr 2), 86 d (yr 3), 72 d (yr 4), and 56 d (yr 5). Pasture ADG of cattle did not differ among treatments (P = 0.13) and were 0.51, 0.59, and 0.56 kg/d (SEM 0.03) for E+, E-, and EN, respectively. Serum prolactin concentrations of heifers grazing E+ were less (P < 0.05) than those grazing E- and EN during all years except yr 2. In yr 2, E+ and E- did not differ (P = 0.11). Serum prolactin of heifers grazing E- and EN did not differ (P > 0.20) except in yr 4. During yr 4, serum prolactin of heifers grazing E- was greater (P = 0.05) than that of heifers grazing EN. Serum urea-N concentrations (SUN) tended to differ among treatments (P = 0.10) and there was a treatment x year interaction (P = 0.05). During yr 1 through 3, SUN did not differ (P > 0.15) among treatments. However, as the stands aged, E- had a greater invasion of other plant species, which increased the CP content of the sward, thus causing heifers grazing E- during yr 5 to have greater (P < 0.01) SUN than heifers grazing E+ and EN, which did not differ (P = 0.89). Forage disappearance (DM basis) did not differ (P = 0.75) among treatments and was 4.7, 4.7, and 5.0 kg/animal daily (SEM 0.27) for E+, E-, and EN, respectively. Body weight gain per hectare was greater (P = 0.04) for E+ (257 kg) than for E- (220 kg) or EN (228 kg). In most years, animal grazing days on E+ were greater than those on E- or EN. However, in yr 5, animal grazing days did not differ (P > 0.20) among treatments.

20573,ACREMONIUM IN FESCUE AND RYEGRASS - BOON OR BANE - A REVIEW,"Acremonium coenophialum Morgan-Jones and Gams, an: endophytic fungus commonly found in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), has been identified as the cause of poor performance of beef cattle and horses on tall fescue. Ryegrass staggers, a neurological disorder of sheep, has been linked to the presence of a similar fungus, A. lolii Latch, Christensen and Samuels, in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Renovation of endophyte-infected (E+) pastures with endophyte-free (E-) cultivars of tall fescue or perennial ryegrass has resulted in improved animal performance, but productivity and stand persistence of tl-ie grasses have been reduced. Stand loss of E- tall fescue has been attributed to a number of stresses, including insect attack, disease, root predation by nematodes, and drought stress. The Acremonium endophyte has been observed to stimulate the tall fescue plant's production of chitinase, an enzyme associated with disease resistance. Nematode resistance, which can also be enhanced in Ec plants, has been attributed, in part, to thickening of the root endodermal layer. Drought stress has been identified as the most common cause of E- tall fescue stand loss in the eastern United States. Endophyte-infected tall fescue plants exhibit several adaptive morphological and physiological responses to drought stress compared with E- plants. Drought-induced leaf rolling, leaf senescence, stomatal closure, and osmotic adjustment are more prevalent in E+ than in E- plants and may be mediated through endophyte enhancement Of the production of phytohormones such as abscisic acid. Endophyte-infected tall fescue plants have been shown to be more productive and competitive than E- plants through improvement of germination, tillering, and biomass production per tiller. The increase in tiller production associated with endophyte infection may be due to fungal secretion of indoleacetic acid. The presence of Acremonium endophytes enhances a number of physiological responses that sensitize host plants to abiotic and biotic stresses, resulting in improved plant persistence. Pasture management practices for E+ and E- tall fescue and perennial ryegrass need to take into account the effects of the endophyte on plant growth as well as endophyte effects on animal performance.","JOOST, RE",JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE,1995,NA,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.862080128567287,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,observed,"Christensen and Samuels, in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.).

4601,Gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence in symbiotic and non-symbiotic ryegrass under water stress,"The symbiotic association of endophyte fungus, Neotyphodium lolii, and ryegrass improves the ryegrass resistance to drought. This is shown by a 30 % increase in the number of suckers in infected plants (E+), compared to plants lacking endophyte (E-), and by a higher water potential in the E+ than E- plants. The E+ plants have higher stomatal conductance (g(s)), transpiration rate, net photosynthetic rate (P-N), and photorespiratory electron:transport rate than the E- plants. The maximal photochemical efficiency (F-v/F-m) and the actual photochemical efficiency (Phi(PS2)) are not affected by the endophyte fungus. The increase in P-N of the Et plants subjected to water stress was independent from internal CO2 concentration. An increased P-N was observed in E+ plants also in optimal water supply.

4331,Pathological changes seen in horses in New Zealand grazing Mediterranean tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) infected with selected endophytes (Epichloe coenophiala) causing equine fescue oedema,"AIM: To investigate whether Mediterranean tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh. (syn Festuca arundinacea)) infected with selected fungal endophytes (Epichloe coenophiala (formerly Neotyphodium coenophialum)) caused equine fescue oedema when grown in New Zealand, and to examine the pathological changes associated with this intoxication.METHODS: Horses were grazed on Mediterranean tall fescue that was infected with the endophytes AR542 (n=2), or AR584 (n=3), or Mediterranean tall fescue that was endophyte-free (n=2). Blood samples were taken up to 7 days after the start of feeding to detect changes in concentrations of total protein in serum and packed cell volume. Any horse showing clinical evidence of disease was subject to euthanasia and necropsy.RESULTS: Within 6 days, both horses grazing fescue infected with AR542 became depressed and lethargic. One horse grazing fescue infected with endophyte AR584 became depressed within a 5-day feeding period while another horse in this group died shortly after being removed from the AR584 pasture. The third horse in this group did not develop clinical signs within the 5-day feeding period. However, haemoconcentration and hypoproteinaemia was detected in all horses grazing Mediterranean tall fescue that was infected by AR542 or AR584 endophyte. No abnormalities were observed in horses grazing fescue that was endophyte-free. Necropsy examination was performed on two horses grazing fescue infected with AR542 and one horse grazing fescue infected with AR584. All three horses had marked oedema of the gastrointestinal tract. Histologically, the oedema was accompanied by large numbers of eosinophils, but no necrosis.CONCLUSIONS: Horses grazing Mediterranean tall fescue that was infected by AR542 or AR584 developed hypoproteinaemia and haemoconcentration, most likely due to leakage of plasma proteins into the gastrointestinal tract. This suggests that these selected endophytes produce a compound that is toxic to horses, although the toxic principle is currently unknown.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Mediterranean tall fescue that is infected by AR542 or AR584 should not be fed to horses in New Zealand. This intoxication should be considered in horses in which a rapid onset of hypoproteinaemia and haemoconcentration is detected. This intoxication should also be considered if marked gastrointestinal oedema is observed.","Munday, JS; Finch, SC; Vlaming, JB; Sutherland, BL; Fletcher, LR",NEW ZEALAND VETERINARY JOURNAL,2017,10.1080/00480169.2016.1248516,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.982699078996907,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,observed,"infected with the endophytes AR542 (n=2), or AR584 (n=3), or Mediterranean tall fescue that was endophyte-free (n=2).

1826,Infection by Endophytic Epichloe sibirica Was Associated with Activation of Defense Hormone Signal Transduction Pathways and Enhanced Pathogen Resistance in the Grass Achnatherum sibiricum,"Epichloe endophytes can improve the resistance of host grasses to pathogenic fungi, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we used phytohormone quantifications, gene expression analysis, and pathogenicity experiments to investigate the effect of Epichloe sibirica on the resistance of Achnatherum sibiricum to Curvularia lunata pathogens. Comparison of gene expression patterns between endophyte-infected and endophyte-free leaves revealed that endophyte infection was associated with significant induction of 1,758 and 765 differentially expressed genes in the host before and after pathogen inoculation, respectively. Functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes suggested that endophyte infection could activate the constitutive resistance of the host by increasing photosynthesis, enhancing the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species, and actively regulating the expression of genes with function related to disease resistance. We found that endophyte infection was associated with induction of the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis pathways of jasmonic acid, ethylene, and pipecolic acid and amplified the defense response of the jasmonic acid/ethylene co-regulated EIN/ERF1 transduction pathway and Pip-mediated TGA transduction pathway. Phytohormone quantifications showed that endophyte infection was associated with significant accumulation of jasmonic acid, ethylene, and pipecolic acid after pathogen inoculation. Exogenous phytohormone treatments confirmed that the disease index of plants was negatively related to both jasmonic acid and ethylene concentrations. Our results demonstrate that endophyte infection can not only improve the constitutive resistance of the host to phytopathogens before pathogen inoculation but also be associated with enhanced systemic resistance of the host to necrotrophs after C. lunata inoculation.","Shi, XJ; Qin, TZ; Qu, YB; Zhang, JZ; Hao, G; Zhao, NX; Gao, YB; Ren, AZ",PHYTOPATHOLOGY,2022,10.1094/PHYTO-12-21-0521-R,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.945151744097128,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,amplified,"of Achnatherum sibiricum to Curvularia lunata pathogens.

Stability parameters, based on regression of cultivar x WL X year means on their respective WL x gear means, differed among cultivars in analyses including all harvests but were relatively uniform (b approximate to 1.0) for most cultivars later in the season. Differentes in DMY between 'Ky 31' tall fescue infected with the Neotyphodium endophyte and its endophyte-free counterpart confirms earlier reports of the positive effect of this fungal organism on forage yield in fall fescue, particularly in water-limited environments.

16689,Sleep time following anesthesia in mouse lines selected for resistance or susceptibility to fescue toxicosis.,"In previous work, a mouse line selected for resistance (R) to fescue toxicosis had higher activities of two hepatic Phase II detoxification enzymes than a mouse line selected for fescue toxicosis susceptibility (S). The primary objective of the present study was to determine whether those same lines also differed in hepatic Phase I enzyme activity, estimated from sleep time (ST) following sodium pentobarbital anesthesia. Additional objectives were to determine whether ST differences between lines were modulated by endophyte-infected fescue in the diet (with or without an enzyme inducer) and whether ST of individual mice was correlated with the effect of a toxin-containing diet on the postweaning growth of those mice. In Exp. I, 24 males from each line were randomly assigned to each of five diets: control (commercial rodent food meal); E+ (50% endophyte-infected fescue seed, 50% control); E+P (the E+ diet supplemented with 1,000 ppm phenobarbital); E- (50% endophyte-free fescue seed, 50% control); and E-P (the E- diet supplemented with 1,000 ppm phenobarbital). After 4 wk on these diets, ST was measured on all the mice. A second ST was recorded on each mouse by randomly sampling one-fourth of the population after 1, 2, 3, or 4 wk on a pelleted rodent food diet. Regardless of diet, R mice had shorter first and second ST than S mice (P < 0.01), suggesting higher hepatic Phase I microsomal enzyme activity. Mice on both phenobarbital-supplemented diets had shorter first ST than mice whose diets did not include that microsomal enzyme inducer (P < 0.01). In Exp. II, ST was measured on male and female R and S mice (n = 280) after they had been fed the E- diet for 2 wk, then the E+ diet for 2 wk, and then a pelleted rodent food diet for 2 wk. Growth response to the E+ diet was the percentage of reduction in gain on the E+ diet compared to gain on the E- diet the previous 2 wk. As in Exp. I, S mice slept longer than R mice (P < 0.01). The residual correlation between ST and gain reduction associated with the E+ diet equaled 0.04.

17101,Fungal endophytes as prolific source of phytochemicals and other bioactive natural products: A review.,"Endophytic fungi are those that live internally in apparently healthy and asymptomatic hosts. Endophytic fungi appear to be ubiquitous; indeed, no study has yet shown the existence of a plant species without endophytes. High species diversity is another characteristic of endophytic mycobiota which is depicted by the fact that it is quite common for endophyte surveys to find assemblages consisting of more than 30 fungal species per host plant species. Medicinal plants had been used to isolate and characterize directly the bioactive metabolites. However, the discovery of fungal endophytes inside these plants with capacity to produce the same compounds shifted the focus of new drug sources from plants to fungi. Bioactive natural products from endophytic fungi, isolated from different plant species, are attracting considerable attention from natural product chemists and biologists alike which is clearly depicted by the steady increase of publications devoted to this topic during the recent years. This review will highlight the chemical potential of endophytic fungi with focus on the detection of pharmaceutically valuable plant constituents as products of fungal biosynthesis.

16759,Alterations in hemograms and serum biochemical analytes of steers after prolonged consumption of endophyte-infected tall fescue.,"The objective of the current study was to delineate changes that occur in serum analytes and blood cellular elements in cattle that graze endophyte-infested (Neotyphodium coenophialum) tall fescue. Tall fescue is grown on more than 35 million acres (14.2 million ha) of pasture in the United States, and three-fourths of the pastures are infected with the endophyte at a 60% or greater level. Tall fescue toxicosis caused by endophyte-produced ergot alkaloids continues to be the most important grass-related disease in the United States, in terms of economic loss to animal producers. However, the agronomic attributes of tall fescue make it an attractive forage species because of its ability to withstand cool temperatures, drought, poor soil conditions, and intensive defoliation from herbivore species, including insects. Tall fescue toxicosis is a complex disease and the need exists to understand the mechanisms of the toxic effects in order to institute effective, prophylactic control measures. Our group previously reported changes that occur in serum biochemical analytes of cattle that graze endophyte-infected tall fescue. An additional year's worth of data have been added, strengthening and corroborating these data. Consistent and significant changes associated with tall fescue toxicosis during the 3-yr study included decreased serum concentrations of cholesterol, globulin (increased albumin/globulin ratio), prolactin, total protein, and copper. The activity of alanine aminotransferase was decreased in serum, whereas an increase in serum concentrations of creatinine and total bilirubin occurred. The present report also documents comparative hemograms of cattle that grazed endophyte-infected or endophyte-free tall fescue over a prolonged period. The mean erythrocyte counts were increased in cattle that grazed endophyte-infected tall fescue, whereas mean corpuscular hemoglobin and mean corpuscular volume were decreased, as were mean eosinophil counts. Thus, repeatable changes have been identified that occur in serum biochemical and blood cellular values of cattle grazing endophyte-infected tall fescue that will aid in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease. In addition, these consistently altered parameters can be used to assess the effectiveness of potential prophylactic treatments.",Oliver JW; Schultze AE; Rohrbach BW; Fribourg HA; Ingle T; Waller JC,Journal of animal science,2000,10.2527/2000.7841029x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.925430265835407,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS,bilirubin occurred.

12776,Comparative physiological study of endophyte-infected and non-infected genotypes of Lolium perenne under drought stress,"To evaluate the effect of drought stress on some physiological characteristics of six endophyte-infected (E+) genotypes and four endophyte-free (E-) genotypes of Lolium perenne, an experiment was carried out within a completely randomized design in three replications. In pot culture, one- month stress conditions for E+ and E- genotypes of L. perenne were handled by limiting irrigation to fulfill 20% field capacity of the soil. The physiological characteristics of E+ and E- genotypes of L. perenne indicated a better resistance of E + genotypes under drought stress in terms of higher biomass and relative water content, deeper root system, and greater osmolytes accumulation and antioxidant potential. It is concluded that the osmotic adjustment (higher content of proline and total carbohydrate), lower oxidative biomarkers (H2O2 and MDA content), higher enzymatic and nonenzymatic components (phenolic, GSH), and induction of stress hormone (Abscisic acid (ABA)) are key protective mechanisms in E + genotypes under drought stress. In contrast, E- genotypes of Lolium had some compliant mechanisms to cope with drought stress, including enhanced antioxidant activity, presented lower lipid peroxidation, improved osmolyte accumulation, induction of ABA hormone and up-regulation of Lptip1;1 and Lptip1;2; aquaporin genes. It seems that E- genotypes apply the defensive antioxidant mechanism more than E + genotypes and use more ABA as a critical component of the stress acclimation mechanism in drought conditions.","Vanani, FR; Shabani, L; Sabzalian, MR; Sharifi-Tehrani, M",BMC PLANT BIOLOGY,2025,10.1186/s12870-025-06275-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.977270765507813,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,culture,"effect of drought stress on some physiological characteristics of six endophyte-infected (E+) genotypes and four endophyte-free (E-) genotypes of Lolium perenne, an experiment was carried out within a completely randomized design",NA,direct_absence,culture_methods

12722,Testing the roles of vertical transmission and drought stress in the prevalence of heritable fungal endophytes in annual grass populations,"Beneficial inherited symbionts are expected to reach high prevalence in host populations, yet many are observed at intermediate prevalence. Theory predicts that a balance of fitness benefits and efficiency of vertical transmission may interact to stabilize intermediate prevalence. We established populations of grass hosts (Lolium multiflorum) that varied in prevalence of a heritable fungal endophyte (Epichloe occultans), allowing us to infer long-term equilibria by tracking change in prevalence over one generation. We manipulated an environmental stressor (elevated precipitation), which we hypothesized would reduce the fitness benefits of symbiosis, and altered the efficiency of vertical transmission by replacing endophyte-positive seeds with endophyte-free seeds. Endophytes and elevated precipitation both increased host fitness, but symbiont effects were not stronger in the drier treatment, suggesting that benefits of symbiosis were unrelated to drought tolerance. Reduced transmission suppressed the inferred equilibrium prevalence from 42.6% to 11.7%. However, elevated precipitation did not modify prevalence, consistent with the result that it did not modify fitness benefits. Our results demonstrate that failed transmission can influence the prevalence of heritable microbes and that intermediate prevalence can be a stable equilibrium due to forces that allow symbionts to increase (fitness benefits) but prevent them from reaching fixation (failed transmission).","Cavazos, BR; Bohner, TF; Donald, ML; Sneck, ME; Shadow, A; Omacini, M; Rudgers, JA; Miller, TEX",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,2018,10.1111/nph.15215,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.860999892150756,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,observed,"benefits of symbiosis, and altered the efficiency of vertical transmission by replacing endophyte-positive seeds with endophyte-free seeds.

17569,Steer and pasture responses for a novel endophyte tall fescue developed for the upper transition zone.,"A 2-yr grazing experiment was conducted with crossbred steers (8 to 10 mo and with initial BW of 304 kg ± 34 kg in 2008 and 277 kg ± 24 in 2009) to evaluate animal performance and pasture responses of a late maturing tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh; KYFA9301] population infected with the AR584 novel, non-toxic endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum; NE9301) as compared with Kentucky 31 fescue infected with the common toxic endophyte strain (KY31), 'Jesup' MaxQ fescue infected with the AR542 endophyte (MaxQ), and endophyte-free KYFA9301 (EF9301). Treatments were assigned for seeding in 1.0-ha pastures in a randomized complete block design with 3 replications. Pastures were grazed from 6 May to 23 July in 2008 (76 d) and 2 April to 25 June in 2009 (84 d). Each pasture was grazed with 4 tester steers and put-and-take steers were used to maintain forage mass at 2,500 ± 250 kg DM/ha. Shrunk BW was taken at initiation and termination of grazing each year. Rectal and skin temperatures were recorded, and jugular blood was collected each year at approximately d 28, 56, and study completion. Forage samples were collected at 2-wk intervals for analyzing CP, IVDMD, ADF, and NDF. Responses were analyzed with mixed models, and preplanned orthogonal contrasts were used to compare KY31 with non-toxic fescues, EF9301 vs. novel endophyte fescues, and NE9301 vs. MaxQ. All steer responses were similar (P > 0.10) among the non-toxic fescues. Average daily gains and total BW gain/ha for the 3 non-toxic fescues were greater (P < 0.001) than for KY31. Rectal/skin temperatures for the 3 non-toxic fescues were less (P < 0.001) and serum prolactin concentrations were greater (P < 0.01) than for KY-31.

12782,Germination response of endophytic Festuca rubra seeds in the presence of arsenic,"Epichloe fungal endophytes colonize the intercellular space of aerial organs of their plant hosts without causing symptoms. These symbionts are known to improve the performance of their host grasses in some situations of biotic and abiotic stress, leading to the suggestion that they can be used to improve grass tolerance to contaminants. The grass Festuca rubra is a host of the endophyte Epichloe festucae. We used two half-sib lines of F. rubra, each line composed of infected (E+) or endophyte-free (E-) seeds, to study the effect of varying levels of arsenic (6, 12, 25, and 50 mg L-1), and of the endophyte in seed germination and radicle growth. The results showed that seed germination was not significantly affected by arsenic (As) levels lower than 25 mg L-1, indicating that this grass has a relatively high tolerance of As at the germination stage. The decrease in germination observed at 25 and 50 mg L-1 was due to increased seed mortality and to the reversible inhibition of the germination of viable seeds caused by As. The presence of the endophyte did not change the germination response to arsenic of one line, but affected negatively the germination of the other line. In contrast to the process of germination, radicles of E+ seeds of both lines were longer than those of endophyte-free seeds. The results of this work indicate that Epichloe endophytes can affect the performance of some F. rubra genotypes when As is present in the soil.","de Aldana, BRV; Gundel, PE; Criado, BG; Ciudad, AG; Sánchez, AG; Zabalgogeazcoa, I",GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE,2014,10.1111/gfs.12049,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.874184069671733,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,observed,"We used two half-sib lines of F. rubra, each line composed of infected (E+) or endophyte-free (E-) seeds, to study the effect of varying levels of arsenic (6, 12, 25, and",has a relatively high tolerance of As at the germination stage.

2307,Drought Responsive Putative Marker-Trait Association in Tall Fescue as Influenced by the Presence of a Novel Endophyte,"Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is one of the most important cool-season perennial obligatory outcrossing forage grasses in the United States. The production and persistence of tall fescue is significantly affected by drought in the south-central United States. Shoot-specific endophyte (Epichloe coenophiala)-infected tall fescue showed superior performance under both biotic and abiotic stress conditions. We performed a genome-wide association analysis using clonal pairs of novel endophyte AR584-positive (EP) and endophyte-free (EF) tall fescue populations consisting of 205 genotypes to identify marker-trait associations (MTAs) that contribute to drought tolerance. The experiment was performed through November 2014 to June 2018 in the field, and phenotypic data were taken on plant height, plant spread, plant vigor, and dry biomass weight under natural summer conditions of sporadic drought. Genotyping-by-sequencing of the population generated 3,597 high quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for further analysis. We identified 26 putative drought responsive MTAs (17 specific to EP, eight specific to EF, and one in both EP and EF populations) and nine of them (i.e., V.ep_10, S.ef_12, V.ep_27, HSV.ef_31, S.ep_30, SV.ef_32, V.ep_68, V.ef_56, and H.ef_57) were identified within 0.5 Mb region in the tall fescue genome (44.5-44.7, 75.3-75.8, 77.5-77.9 and 143.7-144.2 Mb). Using 26 MTAs, 11 tall fescue genotypes were selected for subsequent study to develop EP and EF drought tolerant tall fescue populations. Ten orthologous genes (six for EP and four for EF population) were identified in Brachypodium genome as potential candidates for drought tolerance in tall fescue, which were also earlier reported for their involvement in abiotic stress tolerance. The MTAs and candidate genes identified in this study will be useful for marker-assisted selection in improving drought tolerance of tall fescue as well opening avenue for further drought study in tall fescue.","Talukder, SK; Islam, MS; Krom, N; Chang, J; Saha, MC",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2021,10.3389/fpls.2021.729797,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.926362196360121,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,sequencing,We performed a genome-wide association analysis using clonal pairs of novel endophyte AR584-positive (EP) and endophyte-free (EF) tall fescue populations consisting of 205 genotypes to identify marker-trait associations (MTAs) that contribute,NA,direct_absence,molecular_methods

The number of hybridized spots represented approximately 40% of the total 10,000 rat genes/ESTs evaluated. Each luteal sample was analyzed in triplicate, resulting in within treatment correlation coefficients of ≥0.98. Median values of mRNA abundance from luteal tissue taken from the endophyte-infected fed heifers revealed 598 genes and ESTs that were down regulated and 56 genes and ESTs that were upregulated compared with luteal mRNA values from the endophyte-free treatment.

Replicated 0.11-ha tall fescue paddocks were established at the central Georgia Branch Station during September 1997 and stocked with lambs from spring 1998 through autumn 2000. Mean ergot alkaloid concentrations were higher (P < 0.01) in E+ forage than in AR542, AR502, and E- tall fescue, and ergot alkaloid concentrations in E- plants and plants infected with AR542 and AR502 were low. Forage availability did not differ (P = 0.92) across treatments during autumn and was higher (P < 0.05) in Georgia-5 AR542 than in Jesup AR502 and E+ pastures. Initial serum prolactin (PRL) concentrations did not differ (P = 0.58) across treatments during autumn, but were higher on Jesup AR542 than E+ during spring. Post-treatment serum PRL concentrations were depressed (P < 0.01) on E+ compared with AR542, AR502, and E- in both spring and autumn.

12416,Developing a method for laboratory biosafety testing impacts of transgenic plants on non-target insects,"A series of laboratory experiments was carried out with the main objective of contributing to the development of biosafety testing methods for transgenic plants or plants produced by other novel technologies. The adult stage of a New Zealand native weevil, Nicaeana cervina (Broun) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Entiminae), was used as a test insect as this has become well-adapted to introduced pasture species, feeding on both ryegrass [Lolium perenne L. (Poaceae)] and white clover [Trifolium repens L. (Fabaceae)]. Ryegrass plants used in experiments were infected with strains of the symbiotic endophytic fungi Neotyphodium lolii (Latch, M.J. Chr. & Samuels) and Epichloe festucae Leuchtm., Schardl & M.R. Siegel and included a transgenic endophyte, which was modified to eliminate production of the insect deterrent, peramine. Nicaeana cervina was exposed to these endophyte-infected plants along with endophyte-free ryegrass. Weevils were also exposed to white clover with high or low levels of cyanogens, and to white clover selections bred conventionally to contain high or low levels of crude protein. These bioassays were carried out sometimes over a series of time intervals, and weevil survival, feeding, and reproductive performance variables were measured. Nicaeana cervina survival was generally high, although feeding and oviposition were variable between experiments despite high replication in some cases. A summary of significant differences obtained across all experiments suggested that data on the proportion of weevils feeding and amounts of leaf material consumed were more often significantly different than treatment effects on survival or reproductive performance. A positive relationship between the proportion of weevils feeding and those ovipositing was found, suggesting that a 50% reduction in feeding would result in a 28% reduction in the proportion of weevils ovipositing. Power analysis using the range of values recorded for the variables measured indicated that for proportions of weevils surviving, feeding, or fecund, about 35-42 replicates would be required for a 40% difference in values. For measures of leaf consumption and numbers of eggs per female, fewer replicates were required for 95% power when these values were at the higher end of the range than when they were at the lower end of the observed range.

1030,"Ecophysiological Responses of Tall Fescue Genotypes to Fungal Endophyte Infection, Elevated Temperature, and Precipitation","Tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.) Dumort., nom. cons.) can form a symbiosis with the fungal endophyte Epichloe coenophiala, whose presence often benefits the plant, depending on plant and fungal genetics and the prevailing environmental conditions. Despite this symbiosis having agricultural, economic, and ecological importance, relatively little is known regarding its response to predicted global climate change. We quantified the ecophysiological responses of four tall fescue genetic clone pairs, where each pair consisted of one endophyte-infected (E+) and one endophyte-free clone, to climate change factors of annually elevated temperature and seasonally increased precipitation. Endophyte presence increased fescue tillering and biomass production in the elevated temperature treatment and greatly enhanced the ability of two of the fescue clones to recover from the hot and unusually dry summer. Surprisingly, endophyte infection also stimulated biomass production and photosynthesis rates (for one clone) in the most mesic treatment (additional precipitation).

2353,Neotyphodium endophyte increases Achnatherum inebrians (drunken horse grass) resistance to herbivores and seed predators,"Achnatherum inebrians (drunken horse grass), a grass that is intoxicating to grazing animals and commonly found within native grasslands of China, is host to a symbiotic endophyte, Neotyphodium gansuense. In laboratory tests, N.similar to gansuense infections of A.similar to inebrians increased mortality rates and reduced the survival of an aphid Rhopalosiphum padi and a mite Tetranychus cinnabarinus. Both species demonstrated a quantitative preference for feeding on endophyte-free (E-) compared with endophyte-infected (E+) leaves. In the field, populations of the two species were lower on E+ compared with E- specimens for most of the growing season. Results of tests with a grasshopper species (Oedaleus decorus) gave similar results. A species of seed-harvesting ant (Messor aciculatus) showed a preference for collecting E- seeds. These results demonstrate that the anti-herbivore activity of E+ A.similar to inebrians is effective against a wide range of arthropod groups.

17429,Vasoconstriction in horses caused by endophyte-infected tall fescue seed is detected with Doppler ultrasonography.,"The hypotheses that endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum)-infected tall fescue (TF) seed causes vasoconstriction in horses in vivo and that ground seed would cause more pronounced vasoconstriction than whole seed were tested. Ten horses each received 1 of 3 treatments: endophyte-free ground (E-G; n = 4 horses) seed, endophyte-positive whole (E+W; n = 3) seed, or endophyte-positive ground (E+G; n = 3) seed. There were two 14-d periods, P1 and P2. During P1, animals were adapted to a concentrate (0.2% BW, as fed, twice daily) and alfalfa cubes. During P2, the seed was mixed into the concentrate portion of the diet and alfalfa cubes were offered ad libitum. Fescue seed was fed in increasing amounts ranging from 0.02% BW on d 1 (averaging 76 ug/kg ergovaline + ergovalinine) to 0.22% BW on d 11 to 14 (averaging 713 ug/kg ergovaline + ergovalinine). The distal palmar artery of the left foreleg of each horse was scanned via Doppler ultrasonography for 4 d during each period, with 5 replicate scans performed on each scanning day. The measurements taken at each scan included artery luminal diameter, area, and circumference, peak systolic velocity, end diastolic velocity and blood flow variables. Animal temperature, heart rate, and respiration rate and ambient temperature and humidity were also recorded. Blood samples were taken on each scanning day to measure inflammatory cytokine mRNA abundances, and blood samples were collected on d 0, 4, 8, and 14 of P2 to measure prolactin concentrations. Consumption of E+G TF seed caused decreased artery lumen diameter (P = 0.0033), area (P = 0.0406), and circumference (P = 0.0480) compared with E-G seed, and E+W seed produced an intermediate response. Blood flow volume was reduced (P < 0.05) during P2 in horses receiving E+G seed compared with horses receiving E-G seed. Other ultrasound variables were not different (P > 0.05) among treatment groups, and neither were cytokine mRNA or prolactin concentrations. Treatment did not alter (P > 0.05) animal temperature, heart rate, or respiration rate, and neither ambient temperature nor relative humidity was consistently correlated with any response variable measured. Taken together, these data confirm that consumption of E+G fescue seed caused vasoconstriction in horses, which could be readily measured by Doppler ultrasonography.

Thirty-two 4-mo-old lambs were individually penned and randomly assigned to a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement with 2 legume species, sainfoin (SAN; 2.9% condensed tannins) or cicer milkvetch (CIC; without tannins) and a mixed ration containing tall fescue seed (50:30:20 seed:beet pulp:alfalfa) with 2 levels of endophyte infection (endophyte-infected tall fescue seed [E+; 3,150 ug/L ergovaline] or endophyte-free tall fescue seed [E-]). For a 10-d baseline period, half of the lambs were fed SAN and half were fed CIC and all lambs had ad libitum amounts of E-. In an ensuing 10-d experimental period, the protocol was the same except half of the lambs fed SAN or CIC received E+ instead of E-. Subsequently, all lambs could choose between their respective legume and seed-containing ration and between E+ and E-. Finally, an in vitro radial diffusion assay was conducted to determine whether tannins isolated from SAN would bind to alkaloids isolated from E+. All groups consumed similar amounts of E- during baseline period ( > 0.10), but lambs ate more E- than E+ during the experimental period ( < 0.05) and lambs offered SAN ate more E+ than lambs offered CIC ( < 0.05). Groups fed E- during the baseline and experimental periods had similar rectal temperatures ( > 0.10), but lambs fed E+ had lower rectal temperatures per gram of feed ingested when supplemented with SAN than with CIC ( < 0.05). Lambs fed E+ had greater concentrations of hemoglobin and more red blood cells than lambs fed E- ( < 0.05), but plasmatic concentrations of cortisol and prolactin did not differ among treatments ( > 0.10). All lambs preferred their treatment ration over their treatment legume, but lambs in the SAN and E+ treatment ate more legume + ration than lambs in the CIC and E+ (CIC-E+; < 0.05) treatment. All lambs preferred E- over E+, but lambs in the CIC-E+ treatment ate the least amount of E+ ( < 0.05). Binding of isolated SAN tannins to protein was reduced by the E+ isolate ( < 0.05), suggesting a tannin-alkaloid complexation but only from tannins extracted from SAN fed early in the experimental period.

11992,SOLiD-SAGE of Endophyte-Infected Red Fescue Reveals Numerous Effects on Host Transcriptome and an Abundance of Highly Expressed Fungal Secreted Proteins,"One of the most important plant-fungal symbiotic relationships is that of cool season grasses with endophytic fungi of the genera Epichloe and Neotyphodium. These associations often confer benefits, such as resistance to herbivores and improved drought tolerance, to the hosts. One benefit that appears to be unique to fine fescue grasses is disease resistance. As a first step towards understanding the basis of the endophyte-mediated disease resistance in Festuca rubra we carried out a SOLiD-SAGE quantitative transcriptome comparison of endophyte-free and Epichloe festucae-infected F. rubra. Over 200 plant genes involved in a wide variety of physiological processes were statistically significantly differentially expressed between the two samples. Many of the endophyte expressed genes were surprisingly abundant, with the most abundant fungal tag representing over 10% of the fungal mapped tags. Many of the abundant fungal tags were for secreted proteins. The second most abundantly expressed fungal gene was for a secreted antifungal protein and is of particular interest regarding the endophyte-mediated disease resistance. Similar genes in Penicillium and Aspergillus spp. have been demonstrated to have antifungal activity. Of the 10 epichloae whole genome sequences available, only one isolate of E. festucae and Neotyphodium gansuense var inebrians have an antifungal protein gene. The uniqueness of this gene in E. festucae from F. rubra, its transcript abundance, and the secreted nature of the protein, all suggest it may be involved in the disease resistance conferred to the host, which is a unique feature of the fine fescue-endophyte symbiosis.","Ambrose, KV; Belanger, FC",PLOS ONE,2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0053214,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.97737154409141,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS,endophyte-mediated disease resistance in Festuca rubra we carried out a SOLiD-SAGE quantitative transcriptome comparison of endophyte-free and Epichloe festucae-infected F. rubra.

1942,Identification of differentially expressed genes in the mutualistic association of tall fescue with Neotyphodium coenophialum,"Tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum), an agronomically important forage grass, is typically associated with a mutualistic asexual fungus Neotyphodium coenophialum. Plant colonization is endophytic with no symptoms, and fungal growth is confined to the intercellular spaces. The endophyte enhances host fitness by providing protection from various abiotic and biotic stresses and by improving nutrient acquisition. By suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) we identified 29 genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated in endophyte-infected tall fescue as compared to endophyte-free tall fescue. Of the genes that had matches to known genes present in the NCBI databases (approximately 50%), several had roles related to plant defense and stress tolerance. Differential expression of these genes was confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, competitive RT-PCR, and northern hybridization. Endophyte-associated changes in gene expression patterns were consistent among cultivars of tall fescue but differed in some other grass-endophyte associations. Our results indicate that both partners in this symbiosis are active participants, and that the endophyte may be suppressing at least one plant defense gene (putatively encoding PR-10). Further analyses of the differentially expressed genes should aid in understanding the fundamental nature of this mutualistic symbiosis and provide insight into the mechanisms of documented endophyte-enhanced plant improvements.

Different breeding programs have been initiated with this grass, but plant tissue culture techniques could not be used because B. auleticus is recalcitrant. The aim of the present study was to develop a micropropagation protocol in the genus Bromus and to investigate if the association between B. auleticus and Epichloe endophytes affected in vitro culture and growth of micropropagated plantlets. In different micropropagation stages, better results were obtained with endophyte-infected (E+) seeds compared to endophyte-free (E-) seeds.

Endophyte-infected (EI) and endophyte-free (EF) Festuca arundinacea are used as experimental materials to investigate the effects of endophyte Epichloë and soil saline-alkali stress on the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) diversity and community composition in roots of tall fescue. A pot experiment under endophyte infection (EI and EF) and saline-alkali stress treatments (0, 200, 400 and 600 mmol/L) was conducted. There are five replicates per treatment. AMF diversity in roots of tall fescue is determined by high throughput sequencing. The diversity of AMF in EF tall fescue roots decreased with the increase of saline-alkali stress treatment level, and the presence of the endophytes alleviated this effect. Under the 200 and 400 mmol/L saline-alkali stress treatments, the endophytes increased the diversity of AMF in tall fescue roots; in addition, the endophytes caused a shift in AMF community composition, reducing the relative abundance of Funneliformis and increasing the relative abundance of Claroideoglomus, Glomus and some unclassified AMF.

Black Andisol, with a naturally low content of phosphorus, was high in other nutrients, while Red Andisol, with a naturally high content of phosphorus, was low in other nutrients. Shoot dry weight was significantly higher in endophyte-infected (E+) than endophyte-free (E-) plants grown in Black Andisol. On the other hand, in Red Andisol, only Fukaura showed higher shoot dry matter production in E+ plants as compared to E-plants. In general, greater concentrations of phosphorus and manganese were found in endophyte-infected (E+) plants than non-infected (E-) plants. Accumulation of all nutrients in E+ plants was remarkably higher than in E- plants. Excluding the plant ecotype effect, the nutrient concentration and accumulation pattern for plants in the two soils was different in E+ and E- plants. Plants growing in Black Andisol had greater concentrations of phosphorus (P), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) in E+ plants than those of E- plants whereas for plants in Red Andisol the reverse was true. Significantly higher concentration of manganese (Mn) was found in E+ plants irrespective of soils.

12531,Even after death the endophytic fungus of Schedonorus phoenix reduces the arbuscular mycorrhizas of other plants,"1. Plants can host microbial communities whose integrated functions are often responsible for their success. Understanding mechanisms regulating such functions is thus a major goal in ecology. 2. Fungal endophytes of grasses, particularly of the genus Neotyphodium, have been reported to reduce colonization of their host plant by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. However, it is unclear which mechanism(s) may explain the effects produced by the endophyte and whether these effects are present in nature. 3. We used Schedonorus phoenix (syn. Lolium arundinaceum) plants that were endophyte-free or infected with one of two strains of Neotyphodium coenophialum known to produce different putative allelochemicals to test the hypotheses that (i) allelopathic effects of the endophyte reduce AM fungal spore germination; and (ii) the allelochemical compound(s) are leached into the soil even after the death of S. phoenix, where they reduce AM fungal colonization of other plants. 4. In a first experiment, aqueous extracts from the shoots of S. phoenix were applied onto spores of the AM fungus Glomus intraradices to test germination effects. Both endophyte strains reduced spore germination by approximately 10% relative to endophyte-free controls. 5. In a second experiment, we placed dried shoot material ('thatch') on the soil surface of pots containing Bromus inermis, which were either inoculated with G. intraradices or not. We watered the plants through the thatch, relying upon leaching to translocate potential allelochemicals to the soil. AM fungal colonization of B. inermis was significantly reduced when thatch was infected with the common strain, but not with AR542, compared to the endophyte-free thatch. Furthermore, the arbuscule : vesicle ratio was 11-fold smaller when thatch was infected with the common strain compared to endophyte-free thatch, suggesting that G. intraradices was stressed by the presence of common strain-leachate. 6. We observed situations whereby two ecologically widespread plant-microbe symbioses interact. Potential mechanisms may include allelopathic effects, although other factors are also possible, and leaching is a mode of entry of putative endophyte-induced AM fungal inhibitors in soil.

'Streaker'), sheep fescue (Festuca ovina L. 'Azay'), slender creeping red fescue (F. rubra subsp. litoralis 'Logro'), and tall fescue (F. arundinacea Screb. 'Mustang,' 'Apache,' and 'Rebel') had intermediate resistance to Russian wheat aphid feeding. 'Repell' and 'Regal' were infected with a fungal endophyte, Acremonium lolii Latch, Christenson, & Samuels.

'Repell' and 'Regal' showed the greatest resistance to aphid feeding, suggesting that plant resistance may have been enhanced by the presence of fungal endophytes. Observations suggest that Russian wheat aphid survival was better on isogenic lines of endophyte-free tall fescue and that nymphs were more sensitive to the presence of fungal endophyte than adults.

9843,Fungal endophytes enhance wheat heat and drought tolerance in terms of grain yield and second-generation seed viability,"AimsWe evaluated the impact of fungal endophyte symbiosis on the growth, ecophysiological and reproductive success of wheat exposed to heat and drought. Methods and ResultsThe resistance of pot-grown wheat to heat or drought stress was measured by quantifying efficiency of photosystem II (F-v/F-m), plant height, average seed weight (ASW), total seed weight (TSW), water-use efficiency (WUE) as well as time to 50% germination and percentage germination of second-generation seeds produced under heat stress, drought stress or well-watered conditions. The endophytic fungi tested increased wheat tolerance for drought and heat. Endophyte SMCD 2206 was the most beneficial, followed by SMCD 2210 and 2215. Surprisingly, second-generation seeds produced by drought-stressed wheat colonized by SMCD 2206, 2210 or 2215 had decreased WUE relative to those produced by endophyte-free, drought-stressed plants. However, these seeds germinated more rapidly than those produced by endophyte-free, stressed parental plants. ConclusionsThe tested consortium of endophytes has the potential to improve wheat adaptation to heat and drought. Significance and Impact of the StudyThe capacity of endophytes to increase wheat tolerance for abiotic stress and to improved germination in endophyte-free second-generation seeds arising from stressed plants could be applicable to agriculture.

11615,Effects of the endophyte Epichloe coenophiala on the root microbial community and growth performance of tall fescue in different saline-alkali soils,"Soil salinization is detrimental to plant growth and yield in agroecosystems worldwide. Epichloe center dot endophytes, a class of clavicipitaceous fungi, enhance the resistance of host plants to saline-alkali stress. This study explored the effects of the systemic fungal endophyte Epichloe center dot coenophiala on the root microbial community and growth performance of tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) growing under different saline-alkali stress conditions. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to analyze the direct and indirect effects (mediated by root microbial community diversity and soil properties) of the endophyte on the growth of tall fescue under saline-alkali stress. The endophyte-infected plants produced higher shoot and root biomass compared to endophyte-free plants under saline-alkali stress (200 and 400 mM). Endophyte infection increased the fungal community diversity and altered its composition in the roots, decreasing the relative abundance of Ascomycota and increasing that of Glomeromycota. Furthermore, endophyte infection decreased the bacterial community diversity and the relative abundance of dominant Proteobacteria. SEM showed that endophyte infection increased the shoot and root biomass under saline-alkali stress (200 and 400 mM) by increasing the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal diversity in the roots, and soil total nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations. Therefore, it is important to examine aboveground microbes as factors influencing plant growth in saline-alkali stress by affecting belowground microbes and soil chemical properties.","Liu, H; Tang, HM; Ni, XZ; Zhang, YJ; Wang, YC",FUNGAL ECOLOGY,2022,10.1016/j.funeco.2022.101159,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.988563206850587,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS,fescue under saline-alkali stress.

16546,Acremonium in fescue and ryegrass: boon or bane? A review.,"Acremonium coenophialum Morgan-Jones and Gams, an endophytic fungus commonly found in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), has been identified as the cause of poor performance of beef cattle and horses on tall fescue. Ryegrass staggers, a neurological disorder of sheep, has been linked to the presence of a similar fungus, A. lolii Latch, Christensen and Samuels, in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Renovation of endophyte-infected (E+) pastures with endophyte-free (E-) cultivars of tall fescue or perennial ryegrass has resulted in improved animal performance, but productivity and stand persistence of the grasses have been reduced. Stand loss of E- tall fescue has been attributed to a number of stresses, including insect attack, disease, root predation by nematodes, and drought stress. The Acremonium endophyte has been observed to stimulate the tall fescue plant's production of chitinase, an enzyme associated with disease resistance. Nematode resistance, which can also be enhanced in E+ plants, has been attributed, in part, to thickening of the root endodermal layer. Drought stress has been identified as the most common cause of E- tall fescue stand loss in the eastern United States. Endophyte-infected tall fescue plants exhibit several adaptive morphological and physiological responses to drought stress compared with E- plants. Drought-induced leaf rolling, leaf senescence, stomatal closure, and osmotic adjustment are more prevalent in E+ than in E- plants and may be mediated through endophyte enhancement of the production of phytohormones such as abscisic acid. Endophyte-infected tall fescue plants have been shown to be more productive and competitive than E- plants through improvement of germination, tillering, and biomass production per tiller.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Joost RE,Journal of animal science,1995,10.2527/1995.733881x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.945452347171012,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,observed,"Christensen and Samuels, in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.).

8510,Foliar endophytic fungi alter patterns of nitrogen uptake and distribution in Theobroma cacao,"Colonization by foliar endophytic fungi can affect the expression of host plant defenses and other ecologically important traits. However, whether endophyte colonization affects the uptake or redistribution of resources within and among host plant tissues remains unstudied. We inoculated leaves of Theobroma cacao with four common colonizers that range in their effect from protective to pathogenic (Colletotrichum tropicale, Pestalotiopsis sp., Colletotrichum theobromicola, or Phytophthora palmivora). We pulsed the soil with nitrogen-15 (N-15) and then traced N-15 uptake and its subsequent distribution to whole plants and individual leaves. At a whole-plant level, C. tropicale-inoculated plants showed significantly greater N-15 uptake than endophyte-free plants did in the same pot. Among leaves within plants, younger leaves were particularly enriched in N-15, but endophyte inoculation at the individual leaf level did not alter N-15 distribution within plants. However, leaves co-inoculated with pathogenic Phytophthora and protective C. tropicale experienced significantly elevated N-15 content as pathogen damage increased, compared with leaves inoculated only with the pathogen. Further, endophyte-pathogen co-infection also increased total plant biomass. Our results indicate that colonization by foliar endophytes significantly affects N uptake and distribution among and within host plants in ways that appear to be context dependent on other microbiome components.","Christian, N; Herre, EA; Clay, K",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,2019,10.1111/nph.15693,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.97273900258463,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS,"individual leaves.

7701,The influence of timing and planting proportion on the intraspecific competitiveness ability of drunken horse grass ( Achnatherum inebrians (Hance) Keng) by fungal endophyte infection,"Drunken horse grass ( Achnatherum inebrians (Hance) Keng) is a toxic perennial bunchgrass native to Northwestern China. Epichloe endophytic fungi infection could enhance the stress tolerance of drunken horse grass. However, there is a scarcity of literature regarding the effects of intraspecific competition. As a result, we anticipated that the intraspecific competitive dynamics between endophyte-infected (EI) and endophyte-free (EF) plants would become more transparent for four years by planted as the proportions of 2 : 1, 1 : 1, and 1 : 2. The results showed the EI plants exhibited more biomass, seed yields, and survival rates than EF plants. Endophyte infection also facilitated a competitive advantage by enhancing photosynthesis and soil nutrition. Our findings constituted the inaugural investigation into the influence of the intraspecific competitive ability of grass infected with Epichloe endophyte fungi. EI plants caused them to become stronger and stronger, while EF became weaker and weaker by timing and planting proportion increasing, and EF drunken horse grass could be replaced by EI. These conclusions were instrumental in elucidating why the endophytic fungal infection rate of drunken horse grass is 100% observed in natural wilderness.

4734,Volatile compounds of endophyte-free and infected tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.),"Volatile compounds produced by intact plants and ground leaf tissue from endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) were collected by a purge-and-trap procedure and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry The volatile compound profile from ground leaf tissue was similar between E+ and E- clonal plants however, the sheaths of E+ clonal Plants produced higher levels of 1-octen-3-ol, a characteristic volatile compound derived from lipid peroxidation in fungi, which was absent in E- clonal plants. Intact plants produced fewer volatiles than macerated leaves. At 25 degreesC, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol acetate was the most abundant compound, accounting for 77 and 89% of the total volatile emission from E+ and E-plants, respectively. Higher temperature (32 degreesC) significantly reduced the production of (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol acetate. Nonanal was the most abundant compound at 32 degreesC accounting for 52 and 45% of the total volatile emission from E+ and E- plants. Treatment of E+ and E- Plants With jasmonic acid (JA) dramatically altered the volatile compound profile. The levels of (E)-beta -ocimene increased more than 200-fold and accounted for at least 43% of the total volatile emission. Although the presence of endophyte resulted in some qualitative and quantitative differences in the production of volatile compounds, they are unlikely to account for the differences in insect resistance between E I and E- plants. Nevertheless, the production of a unique spectrum of volatiles after JA treatment may represent a significant plant-based defense response in tall fescue that is independent of endophyte.

16545,The effects of fescue toxicosis on beef cattle productivity.,"Consumption of tall fescue forage infested with the endophytic fungus Acremonium coenophialum can result in a condition termed ""fescue toxicosis,"" which is characterized by decreased weight gains, milk production, conception, and serum prolactin and an inability to dissipate body heat by beef cattle. These decreases in productivity have been estimated to cost beef producers more than $600 million annually. The unthrifty appearance of cattle consuming endophyte-infected tall fescue (E+) is most evident during periods of environmental heat or cold stress, suggesting an interaction with environmental conditions. Without temperature stress, cows consumed similar amounts of E+ and endophyte-free tall fescue (E-). But, when temperatures exceeded 32 degrees C, cows that grazed E+ consumed less forage than cows that grazed E-. After removal of E+ from the diet of steers, compensatory growth was observed, indicating no long-term negative effects of E+. A decrease in serum prolactin but apparently little change in other hormones has been measured after consumption of E+. Under periods of heat stress, animals had reduced ability to dissipate body heat, and blood flow to peripheral (rib skin), core-body (duodenum colon), and brain (cerebellum) tissues was decreased. Due to the depressive effects of E+ on prolactin and heat dissipation, dopamine antagonist therapy has been used in an attempt to rectify these changes. Dopamine antagonists have increased serum prolactin but there is limited evidence to suggest an improvement in heat dissipation. Experiments to elucidate the effects of E+ on alpha-1 and -2 adrenergic receptors may also offer insights into developing strategies to overcome the negative effects of E+ consumption. Preliminary results suggest that injections of an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist (prazosin) in rats fed E+ under 32 degrees C conditions increased DM intake and reduced rectal temperature.",Paterson J; Forcherio C; Larson B; Samford M; Kerley M,Journal of animal science,1995,10.2527/1995.733889x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.91425419695234,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,observed,"an interaction with environmental conditions.

The analysis of 848 fungal endophytes from 213 leaves resulted in 50 different species. In the understorey, infection density and species richness were higher than in the crowns of mature trees throughout the whole vegetation period. Within tree crowns, sun-exposed leaves of the top canopy exhibited the lowest infection rates. Most species were rare or absent in spring and in the light crowns and frequent in autumn and the understorey. However, some species, especially the two most frequent, Alternaria infectoria and A. alternata, deviated from these patterns. Young leaves were nearly free of endophytes. Apparently, the subsequent infection and establishment of fungi strongly depend on microclimatic parameters and leaf characters, which create highly variable spatial and temporal colonisation patterns within an individual tree.","Scholtysik, A; Unterseher, M; Otto, P; Wirth, C",MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS,2013,10.1007/s11557-012-0835-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.932171784812185,TRUE,3,2,Medium,free of endophytes,isolated,NA,"Leaf-inhabiting endophytic fungi of Fraxinus excelsior growing in a floodplain forest were isolated during 2008 to investigate vertical community structure, species richness and seasonal variation.

3460,Short-term responses of soil C and N fractions to tall fescue endophyte infection,"Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is naturally infected with a fungal endophyte, Neotyphodium coenophialum, which produces toxic ergot alkaloids that negatively affect herbivores and that may alter soil organic matter dynamics. A 60-week mesocosm study with a factorial arrangement of soil type (clay loam and loamy sand) and endophyte infection (with and without) was conducted to determine potential changes in soil C and N fractions. Forage and root dry-matter production were greater with than without endophyte infection, while forage C and N concentrations were unaffected. Total, particulate, mineralizable, and aggregate-associated C and N fractions increased several fold during the course of the experiment due to large rhizosphere inputs in all treatments. The fraction of total C and N in water-stable macroaggregates (> 0.25 mm) was initially 0.43 +/- 0.10 and 0.46 +/- 0.16, respectively, and increased during the course of the experiment to 0.68 +/- 0.06 and 0.56 +/- 0.15 when averaged across soil type and endophyte infection level as a result of organic matter cycling and deposition in this active biophysical fraction. Changes in soil C and N fractions due to endophyte infection were minimal. The lack of detectable changes in soil C and N fractions due to endophyte infection may have been a result of the overwhelming input of C from roots and/or the relatively short-term nature (60 weeks). Greater plant productivity of endophyte-infected tall fescue is likely a contributing mechanism for eventual changes in total and active C and N fractions that have been observed in long-term pastures.","Franzluebbers, AJ",PLANT AND SOIL,2006,10.1007/s11104-005-5447-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996397881673688,TRUE,3,2,Medium,without endophyte,observed,"in soil C and N fractions.

10971,Forage quality of tall fescue across an irrigation gradient,"Water available for irrigating pastures in the western USA is often limited and varies widely across sites and seasons. Objectives were to determine the trends in crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and in vitro true digestibility (IVTD) of 10 cultivars of tall fescue (Festuca arundinaceae Schreb.) at five levels of irrigation and three harvest dates (early, mid-, and late season). A secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of the endophytic fungus [Neotyphodium coenophialum (Morgan-Jones & Gams) Glenn, Bacon & Hanlin] on these trends. Cultivars differed significantly for CP, NDF, and IVTD, and differences were generally consistent across water levels (WLs). Concentration of CP increased in a near linear manner (154-189 g kg(-1)) from the highest to lowest WL; however, total protein yield decreased from 611 to 447 kg ha(-1) with less water, closely following the trend in forage yield. Forage quality at the late-season harvest, as indicated by lower NDF and higher IVTD values, was significantly higher at the lowest compared with the highest WL. Also, NDF was significantly lower and IVTD significantly higher at the late-season harvest at all WL. Presence or absence of the endophyte was not associated with CP; however, there was a tendency for the endophyte-free cultivar to have lower NDF and higher IVTD than its endophyte-infected counterpart at the higher WL.

12832,Patch burning tall fescue invaded grasslands alters alkaloids and tiller defoliation with implications for cattle toxicosis,"Tall fescue (Schedonurus arundinaceus), an exotic invasive grass in North America, can associate with a fungal endophyte that causes livestock toxicity. Native prairies are frequently managed with interactive fire and grazing, yet little is known regarding tall fescue's endophytic and toxicological responses. From 2012 to 2014, we applied patch-burn grazing (PBG-burning a different third annually) or graze and burn (GAB-burning completely in 2012 but no fire in 2013 or 2014) treatments to tall fescue-invaded grasslands. Burning happened in March/April, and cattle grazing occurred during the growing season. Tall fescue tillers were analyzed for Epichloe endophyte presence and alkaloid concentrations (ergovaline, ergovalinine, N-acetylnorloline, N-formylloline, N-acetylloline). Cattle toxicosis was assessed via fecal ergovaline levels. With PBG, tiller defoliation was greater in burned patches versus unburned and was greater than any years in GAB. In GAB, tiller defoliation was no different the year of the burn than the years without fire. Cattle did not discriminate between endophyte-infected or endophyte-free tillers in either treatment. Endophyte infection levels were inversely related to years since fire (YSF), and various alkaloids displayed asynchronous responses to YSF. Cattle had no detectable fecal ergovaline when managed with patchy or complete pasture fires. Only two herds had detectable fecal ergovaline (> 100 ppb), which were in pastures managed without fire and only in 2013. Thus, patch burning tall fescue-invaded grasslands alters alkaloids and tiller defoliation with implications for cattle toxicosis. Future research should incorporate greater intra-annual resolution of plant phenology relative to focal grazing and alkaloid expression. (C) 2021 The Society for Range Management.

1801,Fungal endophyte symbionts enhance plant adaptation in Antarctic habitats,"Despite their genetic adaptation to local conditions, plants often achieve ecological success through symbiotic associations with fungal endophytes. However, the habitat-specific functionality of these interactions and their potential to drive plant adaptation to new environments remain uncertain. In this study, we tested this using the vascular flora of the Antarctic tundra (Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica), an extreme environment where fungal endophytes are known for playing important ecological roles. After characterizing the root-associated fungal endophyte communities of both species in two distinct Antarctic terrestrial habitats-hill and coast-we experimentally assessed the contribution of fungal endophytes to plant adaptation in each habitat. The field reciprocal transplant experiment involved removing endophytes from a set of plants and crossing symbiotic status (with and without endophytes) with habitat for both species, aiming to assess plant performance and fitness. The diversity of root fungal endophytes was similar between habitats and mainly explained by plant species, although habitat-specific endophyte community structures were identified in D. antarctica. Endophytes significantly influenced C. quitensis homeostatic regulation, including oxidative stress and osmotic control, as well as plant fitness in both environments. By contrast, the effect of endophytes on D. antarctica was particularly evident in coastal sites, suggesting an endophyte-mediated improvement in local adaptation. Altogether, our results suggest that the two Antarctic vascular plant species follow different strategies in recruiting and developing functional symbiosis with root-associated fungal communities.

In the present study, a mixture of uncultivated endophytes, which was originally derived from native healthy banana plant in plantation, was used to artificially inoculate banana tissue culture plantlets. A broad spectrum of bacterial communities was detected in the roots of artificially inoculated plantlets by 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis, and gamma-Proteobacteria was identified as the dominant group. Banana wilt pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense race 4 was inoculated to the plantlets after potting to investigate disease progress. With early diagnosis of fungal pathogen infection, 54% reduction was detected in artificially inoculated plantlets compared to endophyte-free control plantlets. The re-introduction of naturally-occurring endophytes into tissue culture banana plantlets led to a 67% suppression rate of wilt disease at the fifth month after pathogen infection on plantlets in the greenhouse. In addition to disease suppression, growth of host plantlets was also promoted with the inoculation of endophytes. The artificial inoculation method provided a foundational understanding of ecological enrichment to control banana wilt disease in future. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

15248,Advances in the study of endophytes in woody plant seeds; [木本植物种子内生菌研究进展],"Almost all plants in forest ecosystems live in symbiosis with endophytes, and many plants cannot grow normally without endophytes. In recent years, the importance of endophytes for plant growth and health has gradually attracted attention. However, most current studies focused on crops, and studies on woody plant endophytes, especially seed-related endophytes, are very rare. There are many species of endophytes in woody plant seeds, which are divided into endophytic bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas, Bacillus sp., and Erwinia spp.), endophytic fungi (e.g., Alternaria sp., Cladosporium sp., and Fusarium sp.), and endophytic actinomycetes (e.g., Streptomyces and Nocardiopsis). Microorganisms in the environment colonize various organs of woody plants: through the rhizosphere, caulosphere, phyllosphere, anthosphere, or carposphere, and are transmitted to the seeds to form seed endophytes. Endophytes occupy niches such as endosperms, embryos, and endosperms in seeds. Host plants can choose beneficial endophytes to transmit vertically to the next generation through seeds. Woody plant seed endophytes can directly promote seed germination and seedling establishment and produce secondary metabolites to prevent plant diseases and protect plant health. However, some woody plant seed endophytes are harmful to seed germination and plant growth. With the development of metagenomics technology, it will be possible to research seed endophyte species, colonization, and transmission methods at the molecular level. In addition, studying the secondary metabolites of woody plant seed endophytes could have practical applications in plant disease and pest control. © 2022 Science Press.

1649,Demography and Population Projection of Tetranychus urticae (Tetranychidae) on Phaseolus vulgaris (Fabaceae) Colonized by Entomopathogenic Fungal Endophytes,"Tetranychus urticae is a highly polyphagous and global pest. Spider mites primarily feed on the underside of leaves, resulting in decreased photosynthesis, nutritional loss, and the development of chlorotic patches. We investigated the life tables of the two-spotted spider mite T. urticae on fungal endophyte Beauveria bassiana colonized and untreated plants of the common Phaseolus vulgaris L., a bean plant. Based on the age-stage, two-sex life table theory, data were evaluated. The mites raised on untreated plants had protonymphs, deutonymphs, and total pre-adult stage durations that were considerably shorter (1.76, 2.14, and 9.77 d, respectively) than the mites raised on plants that had been colonized (2.02, 2.45, and 10.49 d, respectively). The fecundity (F) varied from 28.01 eggs per female of colonized plants to 57.67 eggs per female of endophyte-untreated plants. The net reproductive rate (R0) in the plants with and without endophytes was 19.26 and 42.53 brood, respectively. The untreated plants had an intrinsic rate of increase (rm) of 0.245 days as opposed to the colonized plants, which had an r of 0.196 days and a finite rate of increase (lambda) (1.27 and 1.21, respectively). Population forecasts based on a two-sex, age-stage life table demonstrated the dynamism and variability of the stage structure. Furthermore, the colonization of B. bassiana had a negative impact on the growth and development of T. urticae. It lowered the adult mite life span, female fecundity, net reproduction rate, and intrinsic growth rate. We propose that future research should better use entomopathogenic fungal endophytes to understand host plant resistance strategies in integrated pest management.","Hong, PX; Dash, CK; Ghafar, MA; Haq, IU; Lu, LY; Zhou, CH; Wu, Q; Wang, LD",INSECTS,2024,10.3390/insects15010073,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.825378390567182,TRUE,3,2,Medium,without endophytes,investigated; evaluated,"per female of endophyte-untreated plants.

1163,Fungal endophytes of Catharanthus roseus enhance vindoline content by modulating structural and regulatory genes related to terpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis,"Not much is known about the mechanism of endophyte-mediated induction of secondary metabolite production in Catharanthus roseus. In the present study two fungal endophytes, Curvularia sp. CATDLF5 and Choanephora infundibulifera CATDLF6 were isolated from the leaves of the plant that were found to enhance vindoline content by 229-403%. The isolated endophytes did not affect the primary metabolism of the plant as the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII, net CO2 assimilation, plant biomass and starch content of endophyte-inoculated plants was similar to endophyte-free control plants. Expression of terpenoid indole alkaloid (TIA) pathway genes, geraniol 10-hydroxylase (G10H), tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC), strictosidine synthase (STR), 16-hydoxytabersonine-O-methyltransferase (16OMT), desacetoxyvindoline-4-hydroxylase (D4H), deacetylvindoline-4-Oacetyltransferase (DAT) were upregulated in endophyte-inoculated plants. Endophyte inoculation upregulated the expression of the gene for transcriptional activator octadecanoid-responsive Catharanthus AP2-domain protein (ORCA3) and downregulated the expression of Cys2/His2-type zinc finger protein family transcriptional repressors (ZCTs). The gene for the vacuolar class III peroxidase (PRX1), responsible for coupling vindoline and catharanthine, was upregulated in endophyte-inoculated plants. These endophytes may enhance vindoline production by modulating the expression of key structural and regulatory genes of vindoline biosynthesis without affecting the primary metabolism of the host plant.","Pandey, SS; Singh, S; Babu, CSV; Shanker, K; Srivastava, NK; Shukla, AK; Kalra, A",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2016,10.1038/srep26583,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.986878792697097,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,isolated,"PSII, net CO2 assimilation, plant biomass and starch content of endophyte-inoculated plants was similar to endophyte-free control plants.

2465,"Arthropod abundance in tall fescue, Lolium arundinaceum, pastures containing novel 'safe' endophytes","Poor livestock performance on tall fescue is linked to infection by a fungal endophyte that enhances grass resistance to stress, including herbivory, while producing ergot alkaloids toxic to vertebrate grazers. Novel safe endophyte/grass associations produce no ergot alkaloids yet retain stand persistence, but they could be more susceptible to insect outbreaks. We tested the hypothesis that grass-feeding insects are more abundant in novel endophyte pastures compared with those containing common endophyte. Above- and below-ground herbivores were sampled across two growing seasons in pastures containing common strain endophyte (KY31), novel endophytes (MaxQ or AR584) or endophyte free. We also sampled natural enemies as an indicator of possible tritrophic effects. With a few exceptions, numbers of predatory, chewing (grasshoppers, crickets, caterpillars) or sucking insects (leafhoppers, planthoppers) were similar in common and novel endophyte pastures. Contrary to our hypothesis, Aphrodes spp. leafhoppers were more abundant in KY31 than other pasture types in 2008; their nymphs also were more abundant in KY31 than in MaxQ in 2009. Adults (but not total numbers or nymphs) of another leafhopper, Psammotettix striatus, were less abundant in KY31 than other pasture types in 2009. Popillia japonica and Cyclocephala spp. grubs did not differ in density, weight or instar among the endophyte-containing associations. In feeding assays, armyworm (Mythimna unipuncta) survival was higher on MaxQ and NE9301, and weight gain was higher on NE9301, suggesting armyworm outbreaks could be more severe on such grasses, but that result may not be attributable solely to alkaloids because common strain and endophyte-free grasses did not differ in either parameter.

16523,Evaluation of humoral immune responses in cattle grazing endophyte-infected or endophyte-free fescue.,"Anecdotal reports suggest cattle with fescue toxicosis may not respond to vaccination and thus, experience increased incidence of Bovine Respiratory Disease Complex (BRDC) when shipped to feedlots. Fescue toxicosis causes hypoprolactemia in cattle. Hypoprolactemia decreases humoral immune responses in mice. Therefore, a study was conducted to compare the magnitude of primary and secondary humoral immune responses against specific antigens in cattle grazing endophyte-infected or endophyte-free fescue. Angus steers were blocked by weight and allocated into four groups. Two groups grazed endophyte-infected (EI) fescue and the other two groups grazed endophyte-free (EF) fescue. All steers were injected IM on d 0 and 21 with lysozyme without adjuvant and concanavalin. A (Con A) with sheep red blood cells (SRBC) in incomplete adjuvant of Freund. Steers were bled on days 0, 21 and 35 post-vaccination. Average daily gains (ADG), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, cholesterol concentrations, rectal temperatures, and serum prolactin concentrations were measured to confirm fescue toxicosis in steers grazing EI fescue. Antibodies to Con A and SRBC were determined by ELISA and hemagglutination assay, respectively. The ADG were decreased for the EI group during the first month. Rectal temperature were elevated and serum prolactin concentrations were decreased in the EI group. Cholesterol and ALP concentrations also were decreased in the EI group. Primary and secondary immune responses against Con A tended to be increased and were increased against SRBC in the EI group. Antibodies against lysozyme were not induced in either group. In conclusion, cattle grazing EI fescue mounted similar humoral immune responses to vaccination, despite hypoprolactemia, as cattle grazing EF fescue.

Tul., have both been suspected as etiologial agents of summer syndrome in tall fescue (F. arundinacea Schreb.). This syndrome is a toxicological disorder characterized by poor cattle growth with visible symptoms accentuated by high ambient temperatures. Alkaloid levels were measured with GLC and presence or absence of the endophyte was determined by cytological observation. The endophyte was controlled by soil incorporation of the systemic fungicide benomyl. Variability was found among the 11 parental clones of the synthetic ''Kenhy'' for level of loline alkaloids. Loline alkaloids were present in seed of endophyte-infected panicles but absent in seed of endophyte-free panicles of the same clone.

12298,Extended larval development time for aphid parasitoids in the presence of plant endosymbionts,"1. Variation in plant chemistry does not only mediate interactions between plants and herbivores but also those between herbivores and their natural enemies, and plants and natural enemies. 2. Endophytic fungi complete their whole life cycle within the host plant's tissue and are associated with a large diversity of plant species. Endophytes of the genus Neotyphodium alter the chemistry of the host plant by producing herbivore toxic alkaloids. 3. Here we asked whether the endophyte-tolerant aphid species Metopolophium festucae could be defended against its parasitoid Aphidius ervi when feeding on endophyte-infected plants. In a laboratory experiment, we compared life-history traits of A. ervi when exposed to hosts on endophyte-infected or endophyte-free Lolium perenne. 4. The presence of endophytes significantly increased larval and pupal development times, but did not affect the mortality of immature parasitoids or the longevity of the adults. Although the number of parasitoid mummies tended to be reduced on endophyte-infected plants, the number of emerging parasitoids did not differ significantly between the two treatments. 5. This shows that the metabolism of individual aphids feeding on infected plants may be changed and help in the defence against parasitoids. An increase in parasitoid development time should ultimately reduce the population growth of A. ervi. Therefore, endophyte presence may represent an advantage for endophyte-tolerant aphid species through extended parasitoid development and its effect on parasitoid population dynamics.","Härri, SA; Krauss, J; Müller, CB",ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,2009,10.1111/j.1365-2311.2008.01037.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.960841775764506,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS,"experiment, we compared life-history traits of A. ervi when exposed to hosts on endophyte-infected or endophyte-free Lolium perenne. 4.

3342,Epichloe festucae endophyte mediated maternal inheritance of dollar spot disease resistance in hard fescue,"Hard fescue (Festuca brevipila) is a fine-leaved cool-season turfgrass and is well adapted for low-maintenance areas, such as home lawns, parks, and roadsides. Breeding for improved disease resistance is a major objective in utilizing hard fescue under low-input management. The Epichloe festucae endophyte-mediated dollar spot (Clarireedia jacksonii) resistance and its mechanism have been well-documented in strong creeping red fescue (F. rubra subsp. rubra). However, little is known about dollar spot resistance in hard fescue. The objectives of this research were to (1) understand the inheritance of dollar spot resistance in hard fescue and determine the reciprocal effects by performing a diallel cross between three resistant endophyte-containing and three susceptible endophyte-free parents and (2) confirm the role of E. festucae endophyte in dollar spot resistance by artificially inoculating hard fescue with the endophyte (ME+) and comparing ME+ plants to their genetically identical counterparts without the endophyte (E-) under dollar spot pressure. The highly significant maternal effect from the diallel cross experiment demonstrated that the dollar disease resistance is maternally inherited in hard fescue and linked with the maternal inheritance of the E. festucae endophyte. The greenhouse study further confirmed that the presence of E. festucae endophyte significantly reduced dollar spot in hard fescue. Understanding this endophyte effect on maternal inheritance of dollar spot resistance will enable more efficient breeding and selection of plant materials to use in the development of improved dollar spot resistant cultivars in hard fescue.","Tate, TM; Wang, RY; Bonos, SA; Clarke, BB; Kowalewski, AR; Meyer, WA",CROP SCIENCE,2025,10.1002/csc2.70012,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.966986168130357,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS,the reciprocal effects by performing a diallel cross between three resistant endophyte-containing and three susceptible endophyte-free parents and (2) confirm the role of E. festucae endophyte in dollar spot resistance by,"hard fescue under low-input management.

10533,"Resistance to the rice leaf bug, Trigonotylus caelestialium, is conferred by Neotyphodium endophyte infection of perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne","Neotyphodium fungal endophytes form mutualistic symbiotic associations with many grasses of the subfamily Pooideae, including important forage and turfgrass species. This relationship provides a competitive advantage to the host plant by increasing abiotic/biotic stress tolerance, such as its resistance to drought, diseases, and insect pests. The insect deterrent effects of endophytes are now receiving attention in Japan, as insect pests growing in meadows are causing problems in adjacent rice paddies. One of the most serious problems is the kernel spotting of rice grains caused by the rice leaf bug, Trigonotylus caelestialium Kirkaldy (Heteroptera: Miridae), which reproduces on Lolium species grown as forage.

9734,Fungal endophyte infection and host genetic background jointly modulate host response to an aphid-transmitted viral pathogen,"Despite their ubiquitous nature, interactions between multiple micro-organisms and their effects on host growth and each other's success have received limited scientific attention. In particular, grasses can be commonly infected by both endophytic fungi and viruses, which are typically transmitted by aphids. In this study, we investigated how an aphid-transmitted viral pathogen and a symbiotic endophytic fungus altered host growth and allocation. We hypothesized that, by reducing aphid feeding, endophyte infection would lower viral titre and consequently decrease the negative effects of virus infection on host biomass production. In a greenhouse experiment, we manipulated fungal endophyte status and virus infection (Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus - PAV) of two tall fescue cultivars with different genetic backgrounds [KY 31 and pasture demonstration farm (PDF)]. In one cultivar (PDF), we also manipulated endophyte strain, using two strains that had been selected for differences in alkaloid production. We assessed host, virus and vector responses. As hypothesized, endophyte infection decreased reproduction and abundance of aphid vectors; however, in contrast to our hypothesis, this response by aphids did not impact viral titre. For both tall fescue cultivars, endophyte infection alleviated the negative effect of virus infection on the proportion of total plant biomass allocated to roots. On the other hand, for the KY 31 cultivar only, virus infection decreased tillering in endophyte-infected individuals, but not endophyte-free individuals. Within the PDF cultivar, both endophyte strains produced similar effects on host, virus and vector responses. Synthesis These results indicate that some of the beneficial effects provided by endophyte infection, particularly alleviating the negative effect of virus infection on the proportion of total plant biomass allocated to roots, do not arise strictly from altering host interactions with herbivores (aphids), but also occur by changing host responses to viral infection. Furthermore, these results emphasize the importance of exploring multispecies microbial interactions and genetic controls on these interactions in order to more fully understand their role in community- and ecosystem-level dynamics.","Rúa, MA; McCulley, RL; Mitchell, CE",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2013,10.1111/1365-2745.12106,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.948016800536717,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,investigated; assessed,"for the KY 31 cultivar only, virus infection decreased tillering in endophyte-infected individuals, but not endophyte-free individuals.

The hypothesis in this study was that the presence of EpichloA << coenophialum in the tall fescue shoot may alter chemical and biological properties of rhizospheric soil and, as a consequence, the soil hydraulic properties and aggregate stability in texture-dependent ways. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to characterize the effects of endophyte-tall fescue symbiosis on water repellency and hydraulic properties of the rhizosphere in six soil types. Aggregate water/ethanol sorptivities and water repellency were determined using a tension micro-infiltrometer. Soil organic carbon, hot-water soluble carbohydrates, basal soil respiration and water-dispersible clay as an index of aggregate instability were also measured. Endophytic symbiosis greatly enhanced soil organic carbon pools and hot-water soluble carbohydrates, especially for the medium- to fine-textured soils, and decreased the basal soil respiration. Changes in chemical and biological properties of the rhizosphere via endophyte infection and soil type altered the soil water repellency, hydraulic properties, and aggregate stability. Lower water sorptivity (due to hydrophobic coatings) and higher ethanol sorptivity (due to altered pore structure) were responsible for greater water repellency in the rhizosphere of endophyte-infected plants compared to endophyte-free ones. Greater sub-critical water repellency, organic carbon, and hot-water soluble carbohydrates induced by endophyte-tall fescue symbiosis could increase aggregate stability of the rhizosphere and facilitate ecosystem restoration in degraded arid lands.","Hosseini, F; Mosaddeghi, MR; Hajabbasi, MA; Sabzalian, MR",PLANT AND SOIL,2015,10.1007/s11104-014-2340-1,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.943013756348858,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,medium,"structure) were responsible for greater water repellency in the rhizosphere of endophyte-infected plants compared to endophyte-free ones.

10741,Gene expression profiling of the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium lolii in association with its host plant perennial ryegrass,"Endophytes of the Neotyphodium/Epichloe complex are filamentous fungi that typically form mutualistic associations with temperate grasses. The endophytes systemically colonise the intercellular spaces of their grass hosts and confer several biotic and abiotic attributes, but can also cause mammalian toxicoses. These symbioses are therefore of significant agricultural importance, and furthermore, the symbioses represent models to understand how such symbioses are established and maintained. To gain a greater understanding of the Neotyphodium lolii-perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) symbiosis, we have generated, sequenced and analysed four in planta expressed sequence tag libraries, enriched for genes differentially expressed during symbiosis via suppression subtractive hybridisation. Subtracted libraries were largely comprised of perennial ryegrass sequences, and comparative functional profiling of endophyte-infected ryegrass libraries with endophyte-free ryegrass libraries revealed downregulation of carbohydrate metabolism and photosynthesis during symbiosis, the latter confirming observations made in previous studies.

3676,Segregation of Lolium perenne into a subpopulation with high infection by endophyte Epichloe festucae var. lolii results in improved agronomic performance,"Background and aims Low temperature stress is a common hazard during plant growth. Endophyte infection has been shown to increase cold tolerance in host plants. Many Lolium perenne cultivars contain low to moderate levels of endophyte. This study was done to explore cultivar improvement by segregation of endophyte containing individuals from the original cultivar to create a high endophyte subpopulation. Methods Endophyte-infected plants were segregated over the first 3 years to produce high-endophyte subpopulation, and field and greenhouse experiments were carried out in the forth and fifth to determine the cold tolerance of the L. perenne subpopulation with high endophyte infection rates (N), the parent (F), the control endophyte-free subpopulation (E) and the control local variety (L). Results (1) After 3 years of screening, high endophyte infection rates in the tillers and seeds of plants were still observed (96.5%), and agronomic traits (crown width, plant height, panicle number, withering, regreen-up, the growth cycle and the over-wintering rate) was also improved with increased Epichloe colonization of host plant. (2) The subpopulation with high endophyte infection rates and improved agronomic traits had better cold tolerance than the parent, the control endophyte-free subpopulation and the control local variety. The possible mechanisms by which high endophyte infection enhances cold resistance in the field include increased root system, increased the over-wintering rate, reduced regrowth periods with the sowing date being October 15th. (3) The high-endophyte subpopulation significantly increased SOD, POD, CAT, and APX activities at 0, 5, and 10 degrees C by 11.8%-44.6%, compared with the parent population. Conclusions The subpopulation had a high endophyte infection rate, improved agronomic traits and higher enzymatic activities. These results indicate that increasing endophyte infection rates by selection, effectively improved agronomic traits and cold tolerance.","Chen, ZJ; Li, CJ; Nan, ZB; White, JF; Jin, YY; Wei, XK",PLANT AND SOIL,2020,10.1007/s11104-019-04370-w,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.881936787356447,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,observed,"the L. perenne subpopulation with high endophyte infection rates (N), the parent (F), the control endophyte-free subpopulation (E) and the control local variety (L).

2510,Reinfection of tall fescue cultivars with non-ergot alkaloid-producing endophytes,"For tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) in the southeastern USA, persistence and yield are directly related to infection with a fungal endophyte [Neotyphodium coenophialum (Morgan-Jones & Gams.) Glenn, Bacon, & Hanlin comb. nov.]. However, most endophyte-infected (E+) tall fescue cultivars produce toxic ergot alkaloids resulting in poor weight gain and reproduction in grazing livestock. The objective of this paper was to assess the strategy of reinfecting 'Jesup' and 'Georgia 5' tall fescue with non-ergot alkaloid-producing endophyte strains. Different cultivar-strain combinations were tested against the E+ and endophyte-free (E-) versions of the same cultivars for stand survival and dry matter yield; in separate experiments, they were assessed for toxicity in lambs (Ovis aries). Most cultivar-strain combinations produced no ergot alkaloids but varied in ability to transmit through seed. The best combination, Jesup (AR542), possessed yield and stand survival better (P < 0.05) than the E- checks and equivalent (P < 0.05) to the E + checks. Lambs gained an average of 124 g/d on both cultivars containing AR542, which was equivalent to gains on E- forage but approximately 57% greater than gains on E+ forage. Animals consuming forage from E- or non-ergotproducing strains did not exhibit depressed serum prolactin or elevated body temperatures of animals on E+ forage. The strategy of reinfecting tall fescue cultivars with naturally occurring, non-ergotproducing endophytes appears promising for removing toxicity symptoms and retaining agronomic performance, but intense screening is needed to identify the best cultivar-strain combinations.","Bouton, JH; Latch, GCM; Hill, NS; Hoveland, CS; McCann, MA; Watson, RH; Parish, JA; Hawkins, LL; Thompson, FN",AGRONOMY JOURNAL,2002,10.2134/agronj2002.0567,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.981952200403741,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,assessed; tested,fescue with non-ergot alkaloid-producing endophyte strains.

13552,Occurrence of fungal endophytes in species of wild triticum,"Seedborne, nonpathogenic, fungal endophytes are commonly found in symbiotic relationships with many members of the cool-season grass subfamily Pooideae. The beneficial effects on plants possessing fungal endophytes, and the detrimental effects on consumers of fungal endophyte-infected plants are widely known. The objective of our research was to determine if fungal endophytes exist in indigenous, wild Triticum (wheat) species from Turkey. From the Triticum species collected, we found two different fungal endophytes. Fungi identified morphologically as members of the genus Neotyphodium were found in the diploid Triticum species T. dichasians (Zhuk.) Bowden and T. tripsacoides (Jaub. and Spach) Bowden. The second endophyte, an Acremonium species, was found in T. columnare (Zhuk.) Morris and Sears, T. cylindricum Ces., T. monococcum L., T. neglecta Morris and Sears, T. recta Morris and Sears, T. triunciale (L.) Raspail, T. turgidum L., and T. umbellulatum (Zhuk.) Bowden. No fungal endophytes were found in T. kotschyi (Boiss.) Bowden, T. ovatum (L.) Raspail, T. peregrinum Morris and Sears, T. speltoides (Tausch) Gren. ex Richter, and T. tauschii (Coss.) Schmal., although the number of samples tested was small for some of these species. Both Acremonium endophyte-infected and Acremonium endophyte-free plants of T. triunciale were found to occur at different frequencies at four collection sites on the Anatolian Plateau. Through two selfed generations of the plants, it was found that the Neotyphodium endophyte was transmitted to 100% of the progeny of T. dichasians and T. tripsacoides. However, the Acremonium endophytes were not transmitted in all plants that originally possessed them. We concluded that fungal endophytes of the genera Neotyphodium and Acremonium inhabit some wild wheat species grown indigenously in Turkey. These endophytes may influence the ecology and distribution of Triticum species, and may also serve as a source of biological control agents of pests or abiotic stress factors in wheat.",Marshall D.; Tunali B.; Nelson L.R.,Crop Science,1999,10.2135/cropsci1999.3951507x,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.715766255851293,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,collected; tested,of samples tested was small for some of these species.

1588,Vertically transmitted fungal endophytes:: different responses of host-parasite systems to environmental conditions,"The relationship between vertically transmitted asexual fungal grass endophytes and their hosts is considered to be mutualistic. Results from agronomic field support this line of reasoning but recent studies have shown more variable results in natural systems. We investigated how high and low nutrient and water treatments affected biomass allocation patterns of endophyte-infected and uninfected Festuca pratensis and F. rubra in greenhouse experiments over two growing seasons. Irrespective of infection status, both grass species showed improved performance on highly fertilized and watered soils. However, infected F. pratensis plants produced larger tillers than endophyte-free plants on soil low in nutrients and water in the first growing season, although they (E +) otherwise showed decreased performance on nutrient-poor soil. In low nutrient and water conditions, endophyte-infected plants produced less tillers and had lower total biomass compared to uninfected plants, and displayed a negative phenotypic correlation between seed production and vegetative growth. The latter indicates costs of reproduction when the plant shares common resources with the fungal endophyte. However, endophyte infection status (E +, E -) interacted significantly with the soil fertilisation in terms of plant growth, having a stronger positive effect on growth in infected F. pratensis plants. In F. rubro, endophyte-infected plants showed higher vegetative growth in fertilized and watered soils compared to uninfected plants. However, infected plants tended to produce fewer inflorescences, This had no effect on seed production, perhaps because seed production was partly replaced by asexual pseudovivipary. Contrary to the general assumption in the literature that fungal endophytes are plant mutualists, these findings suggest that the costs of endophytes may outweigh their benefits in resource limited conditions. However, the costs of endophyte infections appear to differ among the grass species studied; costs of endophytes were mainly detected in F. pratensis under low nutrient conditions. We propose that differences in response to endophyte infection in these species may depend on the differences in life-history strategies and environmental requirements of these two fescue and fungal species and may change during the life span of the plant.","Ahlholm, JU; Helander, M; Lehtimäki, S; Wäli, P; Saikkonen, K",OIKOS,2002,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.990118.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993718708353189,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,investigated; studied,"on highly fertilized and watered soils.

10271,Regulation of Tomato Specialised Metabolism after Establishment of Symbiosis with the Endophytic Fungus Serendipita indica,"Specialised metabolites produced during plant-fungal associations often define how symbiosis between the plant and the fungus proceeds. They also play a role in the establishment of additional interactions between the symbionts and other organisms present in the niche. However, specialised metabolism and its products are sometimes overlooked when studying plant-microbe interactions. This limits our understanding of the specific symbiotic associations and potentially future perspectives of their application in agriculture. In this study, we used the interaction between the root endophyte Serendipita indica and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants to explore how specialised metabolism of the host plant is regulated upon a mutualistic symbiotic association. To do so, tomato seedlings were inoculated with S. indica chlamydospores and subjected to RNAseq analysis. Gene expression of the main tomato specialised metabolism pathways was compared between roots and leaves of endophyte-colonised plants and tissues of endophyte-free plants. S. indica colonisation resulted in a strong transcriptional response in the leaves of colonised plants. Furthermore, the presence of the fungus in plant roots appears to induce expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis of lignin-derived compounds, polyacetylenes, and specific terpenes in both roots and leaves, whereas pathways producing glycoalkaloids and flavonoids were expressed in lower or basal levels.","Ntana, F; Johnson, SR; Hamberger, B; Jensen, B; Jorgensen, HJL; Collinge, DB",MICROORGANISMS,2022,10.3390/microorganisms10010194,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.964266833051825,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS,specialised metabolism pathways was compared between roots and leaves of endophyte-colonised plants and tissues of endophyte-free plants.

2231,Reduced seed viability in exchange for transgenerational plant protection in an endophyte-symbiotic grass: does the defensive mutualism concept pass the fitness test?,"Background and Aims Epichlo & euml; endophytes are vertically transmitted via grass seeds and chemically defend their hosts against herbivory. Endophyte-conferred plant defence via alkaloid biosynthesis might occur independently of costs for host plant growth. However, fitness consequences of endophyte-conferred defence and transgenerational effects on herbivore resistance of progeny plants are rarely studied. The aim of this study was to test whether severe defoliation in mother plants affects their seed production, seed germination rate and the endophyte-conferred resistance of progeny plants.Methods In a field study, we tested the effects of defoliation and endophyte symbiosis (Epichlo & euml; uncinata) on host plant (Festuca pratensis) performance, loline alkaloid concentrations in leaves and seeds, seed biomass and seed germination rates. In a subsequent greenhouse study, we challenged the progeny of the plants from the field study to aphid herbivory and tested whether defoliation of mother plants affects endophyte-conferred resistance against aphids in progeny plants.Key Results Defoliation of the mother plants resulted in a reduction of alkaloid concentrations in leaves and elevated the alkaloid concentrations in seeds when compared with non-defoliated endophyte-symbiotic plants. Viability and germination rate of seeds of defoliated endophyte-symbiotic plants were significantly lower compared with those of non-defoliated endophyte-symbiotic plants and endophyte-free (defoliated and non-defoliated) plants. During 6 weeks of growth, seedlings of defoliated endophyte-symbiotic mother plants had elevated alkaloid concentrations, which was negatively correlated with aphid performance.Conclusions Endophyte-conferred investment in higher alkaloid levels in seeds, elicited by defoliation, provided protection from herbivores in progenies during the first weeks of plant establishment. Better protection of seeds via high alkaloid concentrations was negatively correlated with seed germination, indicating a trade-off between protection and viability.","Fuchs, B; Damerau, A; Yang, BR; Muola, A",ANNALS OF BOTANY,2024,10.1093/aob/mcae133,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.818279292236313,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,studied; tested,"of defoliated endophyte-symbiotic plants were significantly lower compared with those of non-defoliated endophyte-symbiotic plants and endophyte-free (defoliated and non-defoliated) plants.

In an outdoor container experiment, the effects of three distinct endophyte haplotypes (AR1, AR37 and CT) on natural infestations of a root aphid, Aploneura lentisci and a mealybug Phenococcus graminicola were compared with an endophyte-free (Nil) control. Populations of these insects were suppressed in a genetically identical set of plants treated with insecticide. Over 18 months, foliar and root growth, tiller numbers and plant mortality were compared between the different endophyte treatments and between insecticide-treated and untreated plants. Hyphal densities were recorded once during the trial. Untreated plants infected with AR37 had the lowest populations of A. lentisci and P. graminicola, and the highest root and foliar growth compared with other treatments. Growth parameters of untreated plants infected with CT often exceeded that of AR1 and Nil due to low infestations of P. graminicola and lower populations of A. lentisci. Growth of Nil, AR1 and CT plants were higher in insecticide-treated than in corresponding untreated plants but was unaffected in AR37. Untreated Nil and AR1 plants had a lower survival than AR37 and CT plants. Cumulative root outgrowth for treated AR37 plants was significantly lower than for treated AR1 on three sampling occasions. These Epichlo & euml; haplotypes are primarily mutualists, although there are circumstances when they may be disadvantageous to their host.

To investigate endophyte effects on plant responses to acute water deficit stress, we did comprehensive profiling of plant metabolite levels in both shoot and root tissues of genetically identical clone pairs of tall fescue with endophyte (E+) and without endophyte (E-) in response to direct water deficit stress. The E-clones were generated by treating E+ plants with fungicide and selectively propagating single tillers. In time course studies on the E+ and E-clones, water was withheld from 0 to 5 days, during which levels of free sugars, sugar alcohols, and amino acids were determined, as were levels of some major fungal metabolites. Results: After 2-3 days of withholding water, survival and tillering of re-watered plants was significantly greater for E+ than E-clones. Within two to three days of withholding water, significant endophyte effects on metabolites manifested as higher levels of free glucose, fructose, trehalose, sugar alcohols, proline and glutamic acid in shoots and roots. The fungal metabolites, mannitol and loline alkaloids, also significantly increased with water deficit.

We artificially inoculated the endophyte into mature tillers of endophyte-free A. sibiricum. Plants were clipped to 5 cm height after recording growth traits, and analyzed for total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC %), the percentage of nitrogen (N %), and carbon (C %) in leaves before and after clipping. In our study, the prominent host genotype-endophyte infection interactions detected in A. sibiricum indicates that, for many growth and storage traits, endophyte infection can impact a little change. However, there is no overriding consistently positive effect of the endophyte on growth or storage in A. sibiricum before or after clipping. Our study showed that the interaction between endophyte and host grasses was highly contingent on plant genotypes. We found host genotype overrode fungal endophyte infection in influencing tiller number and photosynthetic properties of A. sibiricum before clipping. After clipping, host genotype accounted for more of the variation in regrowth and above-ground biomass of A. sibiricum than endophyte infection. Our study showed that host genotype affected the total nonstructural carbohydrates of A. sibiricum before and after clipping, whereas endophyte infection increased the carbon content after clipping. Genotype by infection interactions for plant height, leaf mass, total nonstructural carbohydrates, and photosynthetic characteristics indicated genotype-specific effects of endophytes on A. sibiricum physiology and photosynthetic capacity.

10805,SURVIVAL OF THE TALL FESCUE ENDOPHYTE IN THE DIGESTIVE-TRACT OF CATTLE AND HORSES,"The endophytic fungus of tall fescue, Acremonium coenophialum, is naturally disseminated only by infected seed. Grazing livestock could serve as potential vectors of this fungus, and stockmen could unwittingly encourage its spread by inappropriate movement of animals between pastures. To test this possibility, a series of experiments were conducted in which cattle were fed a single dose or were allowed to graze ad libitum. Viable endophyte-infected (EI) seeds were recovered from the feces. Recovery of live endophyte reached a maximum of 2.68 EI seeds per gram dry weight (gdw) of feces at 22 hr after feeding a single dose. The last viable endophyte was recovered at 38 hr after feeding, and the last viable seed was recovered at 84 hr. When allowed to graze fescue with EI seed ad libitum, cattle feces contained about 1 EI seed per gdw while feeding and continued to pass decreasing amount of EI seed for 72 hr after removal from the infected pasture. Horses allowed to graze ad libitum passed 0.37 EI seed per gdw. Both cattle and horses were effective vectors of the endophyte and may be a significant source of infection when they are allowed to graze seed and moved to endophyte-free pastures without a period of quarantine.

13532,Influence of consumption of endophyte-infested tall fescue hay on performance of heifers and lambs,"Two experiments were conducted to evaluate performance and physiological responses of heifers and lambs to Neotyphodium coenophialum-infested tall fescue hay fed under European rearing conditions. Endophyte-free (E-) or 100% endophyte-infested (E+) hay was derived from the same cultivar (cv. Clarine) so that the effect of the endophytic fungus could be clearly separated from a possible cultivar effect. In Exp. 1, starting in June 1996, 20 age- and body weight-paired Holstein dairy heifers were assigned for 97 d to one of two treatments consisting of ad libitum access to either E- or E+ hay, corresponding to 0 and .41 mg/ kg ergovaline, respectively. During the experimental period, no significant difference (P > .20) in forage consumption, rectal temperature, or behavioral status of the animals was observed between the two treatments. The E+ diet induced a 10% apparent decrease in ADG and a clear reduction in prolactin (PRL) plasma concentration compared to the E-diet. When animals were all reassigned to a common endophyte-free diet, the E+ group recovered body weight and PRL to levels similar to those in animals fed E-after 7 wk. In Exp. 2, 30 Texel ram lambs were assigned to two treatments consisting of dietary E- or E+ tall fescue hay. The E- and E+ hays were harvested from the same plots as used in Exp. 1 and contained 0 and .96 mg/kg ergovaline, respectively. No effect of the endophyte was found on intake or carcass or testicle weight (P > .20) after the 95-d feeding period. The E+ treatment resulted in a slight reduction in BW at slaughter, mainly explained by a lower ruminal fill (P < .01). In E+ treated animals, prolactin concentrations dropped significantly (P < .001) from d 27. Hay assessment in both experiments showed no difference in chemical composition and IVDMD. The endophytic fungus strongly lowered the palatability of the E+ hay, although there was no effect on intake with heifers (Exp. 1) or with lambs (Exp. 2). The potential of severe heat stress, as expressed by the temperature humidity index, was not high in our experimental conditions, although they were considered rather unusually stressful for the western part of northern Europe.

The experiment was designed to characterize growth, ion accumulation, and antioxidant metabolism of tall fescue infected by the endophyte Epichloe coenophiala to different levels of salinity stress. Endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) tall fescue (cv Kentucky 31) plants were exposed to 10 d of 0 (unstressed control), 100 and 200 mM NaCl treatments in a greenhouse, respectively. Salinity stress caused reductions in plant height, leaf fresh weight (LFW), leaf dry weight (LDW), and leaf water content (LWC), and increased Na+ concentration, but E + plants had significantly higher LFW, LDW, and LWC under both NaCl treatments and lower Na+ than E- plants under 200 mM NaCl. Salinity stress decreased K+ and Mg2+ and did not alter P, and increased Ca2+ in E + plants and caused no change in Ca2+ in E- plants; however, endophyte had no effects on these elements. Chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm), malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) remained unchanged in E + plants, but Fv/Fm was reduced and MDA level and enzyme activities were elevated in E- plants under 200 mM NaCl, where E + plants had significantly higher Fv/Fm and lower MDA, SOD, and APX activities than E- plants. Peroxidase activities increased in E + plants under 200 mM NaCl and in E- plants under both NaCl treatments. The results indicated that endophyte promoted salinity tolerance in tall fescue through maintaining higher growth and photochemical efficiency and lowering Na+ accumulation and lipid peroxidation. The significantly induced antioxidant enzyme activities and lipid peroxidation in E- plants suggested a possible enhanced oxidative injury in endophyte-free plants exposed to a high level of salinity stress.","Pan, L; Cui, SM; Dinkins, RD; Jiang, YW",ACTA PHYSIOLOGIAE PLANTARUM,2021,10.1007/s11738-021-03268-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991506895158503,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,fluorescence,infected by the endophyte Epichloe coenophiala to different levels of salinity stress.

Mannitol, ribitol, and trehalose were more abundant in embryo than endosperm tissues and were identified at consistently higher concentrations within endophyte-infected compared to endophyte-free seeds. The ratio of raffinose to sucrose significantly increased with seed aging in both endophyte-free and endophyte-infected embryo tissues, while significantly lower concentrations of trehalose were detected in tissues dissected from aged-seed regardless of endophyte status.

4221,Photosynthetic activity of Lolium perenne as a function of endophyte status and zinc nutrition,"Grass infection by endophyte fungi can confer host resistance to different types of stress, but limited evidence is available on the related effects on the photosynthetic mechanism of the grasses. Zinc has direct and indirect effects on this mechanism and is one of the more important environmental pollutants. To measure whether photosynthesis of the host plant is affected by fungal infection when endophyte-free and endophyte-infected grasses contain similar excess zinc concentrations in their leaves, two batches of Lolium perenne L. cv. Apollo plants were established, one batch was infected with Neotyphodium lolii, the other was not. Both batches were then treated for 8 d with a nutrient solution containing 0, 1, 5, 10 or 20 mM ZnSO4. The increase in zinc concentration induced some reduction in photosystem II ( PSII) activity but not enough to account for the total drop in the net photosynthetic rate. Endophyte fungus favoured maintenance of the PSII activity, but did not significantly modify the net photosynthesis and similar zinc concentration levels were observed in leaves of both types of plant. Interactive effects of zinc and light induced less photodamage to the PSII of the host, which is able to react to an increase in photon flux density (PFD). In endophyte- free plants, the reaction centre contributed more than antenna complexes to energy dissipation. In endophyte- infected plants, the quenching of the reaction centre and antenna complexes rose simultaneously and at a constant rate, as zinc concentrations increased.","Monnet, F; Vaillant, N; Hitmi, A; Sallanon, H",FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY,2005,10.1071/FP04129,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.95555029080646,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,observed,"pollutants.

2567,ENDOPHYTE EFFECTS ON GROWTH AND PERSISTENCE OF TALL FESCUE ALONG A WATER-SUPPLY GRADIENT,"Ecophysiology of the endophyte (Acremonium coenophialum Morgan-Jones and Gams)-tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) association needs to be understood in order to promote environmental fitness traits of the association while reducing its deleterious effects on ruminants. Our objective was to determine the influence of endophyte on drought stress tolerance, persistence, and yield components of field-grown tall fescue on a Typic Hapludalfs soil. A water supply gradient was established during 1989 and 1989 with line-source irrigation on established populations of 0 and 80% endophyte-infected tall fescue. Whole plots consisted of endophyte infection status, across which a gradient of water was applied in a strip-split fashion with eight replicates. Tiller population density and herbage yield were determined every 28 d and yield components were measured on selected dates. Relative to populations receiving high irrigation (375-650 mm applied), tiller density in nonirrigated stands (0-50 mm applied) from July to October 1988 was reduced an average of 42% in infected tall fescue and 55% in noninfected tall fescue. Tiller density of nonirrigated, infected populations recovered fully to that of high irrigation treatments by 17 November, whereas that of nonirrigated, endophyte-free populations recovered to only 62% of irrigated treatments. The advantage in population density due to endophyte infection continued throughout 1989, a relatively wet year. A benefit in total forage yield due to endophyte infection was not consistently evident because of greater yield per tiller in endophyte-free stands in 1989. Enhanced tiller density and survival were associated with endophyte infection during severe water deficit, and this advantage continued throughout the subsequent year. Endophyte infection confers population stability in tall fescue during drought stress through improved tiller and whole plant survival.","WEST, CP; IZEKOR, E; TURNER, KE; ELMI, AA",AGRONOMY JOURNAL,1993,10.2134/agronj1993.00021962008500020019x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.933400177830532,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS,"recovered fully to that of high irrigation treatments by 17 November, whereas that of nonirrigated, endophyte-free populations recovered to only 62% of irrigated treatments.

1198,Pathways of glyphosate effects on litter decomposition in grasslands,"1. Grasslands store a third of global terrestrial carbon but are vulnerable to carbon loss due to inappropriate livestock grazing. Grasslands management can be improved with a mechanistic understanding of biogeochemical processes that determine carbon storage, such as plant litter decomposition. 2. Herbicides, such as glyphosate, are used to improve the quantity and quality of the forage. In the Flooding Pampa, the most extensive cattle grazed natural grassland and one of the few remnants' temperate grasslands in South America-glyphosate is applied to promote Lolium multiflorum, a forage grass associated with a fungal endophyte nontoxic for cattle. 3. We studied five mechanistic pathways in which the application of glyphosate can alter litter decomposition. We grouped them into single application pathways, through effects on living plants (1), leaf litter (2) and bare soil (3), and repeated annual application pathways, through legacies on ecosystem properties (4) and through the growth of an annual forage grass with a fungal endophyte (5). Single application pathways were tested in a greenhouse experiment using leaf litter of L. multiflorum and of a native dominant grass. Repeated annual application pathways were tested through a field experiment with 3-year annual glyphosate application using leaf and root litter of L. multiflorum with and without endophyte association. 4. Glyphosate application on living plants produced leaf litter with 70% higher nitrogen content and 140% higher decomposition constant than naturally senesced litter. In contrast, glyphosate application on naturally senesced leaf litter reduced decomposition constant by 20%. Glyphosate application on the soil did not affect the decomposition of naturally senesced leaf litter but accelerated the decomposition of the glyphosate-killed plants even more. 5. Legacies of repeated annual application of glyphosate resulted in a notable reduction in plant cover (45%) and potential soil respiration (57%), with a consistent acceleration of leaf (53%) and root (18%) litter decomposition. Furthermore, endophytes in L. multiflorum plants reduced leaf litter decomposition by 22%. On the contrary, endophytes did not alter root litter decomposition. 6. Glyphosate application on living plants and legacies of repeated application on the ecosystem stimulate litter decomposition, which can result in a net carbon loss from grasslands. In other ecosystems, the net result on decomposition would depend on the relative cover of vegetation, above-ground litter and bare soil. This study highlights that glyphosate application should be considered when evaluating sustainable management to preserve and enhance soil carbon storage in grasslands.","Vivanco, L; Sánchez, MV; Druille, M; Omacini, M",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,2023,10.1111/1365-2435.14313,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.95763795503266,TRUE,3,2,Medium,without endophyte,studied; tested,with 3-year annual glyphosate application using leaf and root litter of L. multiflorum with and without endophyte association. 4.

10340,Is the Vertical Transmission of Neotyphodium lolii in Perennial Ryegrass the Only Possible Way to the Spread of Endophytes?,"Endophytic fungi live their whole life within host tissues usually without any visible symptoms. Their vertical transmission (seed-plant-seed) has been well described and documented. However, horizontal transmission (plant-plant) needs more clarification. The aim of this study was to assess the extent to which endophytes move vertically in ecotypes of perennial ryegrass and whether there is evidence for the horizontal transmission of endophytes. Ecotypes from grasslands in Poland were collected in the form of living plants and used for vertical transmission analysis. Plants, the seed collected from these plants and plants grown from this collected seed were tested for endophytic infection. Provided that all produced seeds were viable and able to germinate and produce seedlings, the vertical transmission of Neotyphodium endophytes in perennial ryegrass ecotypes was nearly complete. For the horizontal transmission experiment, endophyte-hosting plants (E+) and endophyte-free plants (E-) of four cultivars were planted in the field in close proximity on small plots that were frequently mown. These studies revealed that after 7 months of growth next to E+ plants, the characteristic Neotyphodium spp. mycelia were found in E- plants, which was especially true for plants growing in close proximity to the infected plants.

895,ACREMONIUM ENDOPHYTE EFFECTS ON TALL FESCUE DROUGHT TOLERANCE,"Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is grown as a forage, turfgrass, and conservation grass from the Gulf Coast to Canada in the eastern USA. The presence of endophytes in grasses can confer resistance to insect pests, enhance growth, and improve tall fescue persistence under high temperature and drought stress. Most tall fescue is infected with Acremonium cenophialum Morgan-Jones & Gams, a fungal endophyte. Our objectives were to determine the effects of endophyte infection on water relations and survival of water stressed (i.e., drought-stressed) tall fescue under greenhouse conditions. Endophyte-free and infected plants of three tall fescue selections were vegetatively propagated and grown together in 38-L weighing lysimeters to allow interplant competition for available soil moisture. Irrigation water and fertilizer were applied for 12 wk after planting before irrigation water was withheld for 8 wk. Water-relation characteristics including full-turgor osmotic potential (psi(pi100)), water potential at zero turgor (psi(L0)), relative water content at zero turgor (RWC0), apoplastic water fraction (beta), bulk modulus of tissue elasticity (epsilon), and the turgid weight to dry weight ratio (TW/DW) were determined before and after water stress. Osmotic adjustment (DELTApsi(pi)) was also determined. Endophyte infection did not affect psi(pi100), psi(L0), RWC0, and beta either before or after water stress and did not affect DELTApsi(pi). Endophyte infection did affect epsilon and the TW/DW ratio, but this effect was not sufficient to alter psi(L0). Total tillers, tiller survival, plant survival, and recovery weights were similar for endophyte-free and - infected plants.

Our objectives were to compare endophyte-infected (E +) and endophyte-free (E -) tall fescue for (i) forage yield and tiller response at different cutting frequencies and heights and (ii) competition with no-till seeded alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Factorialized combinations of 3-wk and hay-stage harvest intervals with clipping heights of 3.8 cm (low) and 7.6 cm (high) were used with E + and E - tall fescue in a 4-yr study. 'Alfagraze' alfalfa was no-till seeded into E + and E - 'Kentucky 31' tall fescue, E - 'AU Triumph' tall fescue, orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.), and Kentucky bluegrass (Pea pratensis L.) in each of 3 yr. Forage yield of E + and E - Kentucky 31 was similar (P > 0.05) within a cutting treatment. When cut at 3-wk intervals, a low as compared with a high clipping height had no effect (P > 0.05) on total forage yield of E + Kentucky 31 tall fescue, but forage yield of E - Kentucky 31 and E - AU Triumph were reduced by 23 and 28%, respectively, in the fourth year.

1616,A symbiosis expressed non-ribosomal peptide synthetase from a mutualistic fungal endophyte of perennial ryegrass confers protection to the symbiotum from insect herbivory,"While much is known about the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites by filamentous fungi their biological role is often less clear. The assumption is these pathways have adaptive value to the organism but often the evidence to support this role is lacking. We provide the first genetic evidence that the fungal produced secondary metabolite, peramine, protects a host plant from insect herbivory. Peramine is a potent insect feeding deterrent synthesized by Epichloe/Neotyphodium mutualistic endophytes in association with their grass hosts. The structure of peramine, a pyrrolopyrazine, suggests that it is the product of a reaction catalysed by a two-module non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). Candidate sequences for a peramine synthetase were amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Four unique NRPS products were identified, two of which were preferentially expressed in planta. One of these hybridized to known peramine producing strains. This clone was used to isolate an Epichloe festucae cosmid that contained a two-module NRPS, designated perA. Nine additional genes, which show striking conservation of microsynteny with Fusarium graminearum and other fungal genomes, were identified on the perA-containing cosmid. Associations between perennial ryegrass and an E. festucae mutant deleted for perA lack detectable levels of peramine. A wild-type copy of perA complemented the deletion mutant, confirming that perA is a NRPS required for peramine biosynthesis. In a choice bioassay, plant material containing the perA mutant was as susceptible to Argentine stem weevil (ASW) (Listronotus bonariensis) feeding damage as endophyte-free plants confirming that peramine is the E. festucae metabolite responsible for ASW feeding deterrent activity.","Tanaka, A; Tapper, BA; Popay, A; Parker, EJ; Scott, B",MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY,2005,10.1111/j.1365-2958.2005.04747.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.95723444009232,TRUE,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,amplified,perA mutant was as susceptible to Argentine stem weevil (ASW) (Listronotus bonariensis) feeding damage as endophyte-free plants confirming that peramine is the E. festucae metabolite responsible for ASW feeding deterrent activity.,"catalysed by a two-module non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS).

Cattle were fed ground tall fescue seed at different levels to potentially facilitate digestion and absorption of toxins and identify toxin sensitivity for major characteristics of the condition [i.e., hyperthermia, reduced feed intake (FI), reduced blood prolactin]. Steers (n = 18; 350 kg BW) were housed in the Brody Climatology Laboratory at thermoneutrality (TN; 19°C) and randomly assigned to daily diet treatments with either ground endophyte-infected [E+; low and high doses at 20 and 40 μg ergovaline/(kg BW/d), respectively] or endophyte-free [E-; control at 0 μg ergovaline/(kg BW/d)] tall fescue seed. After 12 d at TN, animals received 2 d of transition to heat stress (HS; 36°C daytime, 25°C nighttime) and maintained for 14 more days. Cattle were fed twice daily at 0800 and 1600 h, with water ad libitum. Feed intake was measured at 0700 h, with skin and rectal temperatures, and respiration rate at 0600, 1100, 1600, and 2100 h. Blood was sampled on selected days for prolactin and leptin determinations. Steers fed ground E+ diet decreased (P ≤ 0.0001) FI below controls at TN, with no dose effect. Maximum FI reduction with E+ treatment was 25% at TN, with an additional 46% decrease during HS (P ≤ 0.05). By the end of HS, E+ FI increased (P > 0.05) to that of E-, suggesting recovery. Prolactin was reduced (P ≤ 0.05) in high E+ cattle below controls at study end. Leptin blood concentrations were unaffected by E+ treatment (P > 0.05) but was reduced (P ≤ 0.05) by the end of HS.

Four ruminally cannulated nonlactating beef cows (539 ± 30 kg) were used in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments utilizing a 4 × 4 Latin square design with 4 periods of 31 d each. Each cow was assigned to individual pens and fed orchardgrass hay (10.3% CP and 85% NDF; OM basis) during a 10-d adaptation period, followed by a 21-d collection period in which each cow was assigned 1 of 4 treatments: 1) rumen-protected Arg (180 mg/kg of BW) and 1.0 kg/d of toxic endophyte-infected fescue seed (AE+), 2) rumen-protected Arg (180 mg/kg of BW) and 1.0 kg/d of endophyte-free fescue seed (AE-), 3) 1.0 kg/d of toxic endophyte-infected fescue seed (E+) alone, or 4) 1.0 kg/d of endophyte-free fescue seed (E-) alone. In each period, Doppler ultrasound measurements for blood flow parameters were quantified on d 1, 5, 10, 15, and 20. On d 20 of each period, blood samples were collected every 10 min for 6 h and then once every hour for 12 h for LH response following exogenous GnRH. There was an Arg × fescue seed type interaction ( = 0.05) for median caudal artery blood flow due to an increase in blood flow in cows fed rumen-protected Arg with endophyte-free fescue seed. In addition, mean blood flow velocity in the artery was greater ( = 0.01) with the inclusion of rumen-protected Arg in the diet.

Twenty-two mature pregnant mares were randomly chosen to graze either Kentucky-31 tall fescue that was free from A coenophialum (endophyte-free, EF) or tall fescue infected with A coenophialum (endophyte-present, EP) after the first 90 days of pregnancy through parturition. Concentrations of pyrrolizidine and ergopeptine alkaloids were significantly greater in EP grass, compared with EF pasture. Ten of 11 mares grazing EP pasture had obvious dystocia. Mean duration of gestation was significantly greater for the EP group, compared with the EF group. Foal survivability was severely reduced among mares grazing EP fescue with only 1 foal surviving the natal period. Udder development and lactation were low in mares grazing EP grass. The absence of clinical problems in mares grazing EF grass implicated the endophyte as the causative agent of reproductive problems and perinatal foal mortality in pregnant mares grazing endophyte-infected fescue grass. Caution should be exercised in allowing pregnant mares to graze pastures infected with the endophyte A coenophialum.","PUTNAM, MR; BRANSBY, DI; SCHUMACHER, J; BOOSINGER, TR; BUSH, L; SHELBY, RA; VAUGHAN, JT; BALL, D; BRENDEMUEHL, JP",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH,1991,NA,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.717470634306352,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,evaluated,NA,NA,direct_absence,investigation_methods
15445,Impact of guttation fluid from perennial ryegrass infected with different strains of Epichloe festucae var. lolii endophyte on Microctonus aethiopoides adult longevity,"Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) grows in association with a fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae var. lolii (Latch, Christensen & Samuels) Bacon & Schardl, which produces alkaloids that protect the grass against grazing by mammals and insects. These alkaloids are found in guttation fluid (xylem sap exuded from leaves through special structures known as hydathodes) and have the potential to impact on beneficial invertebrates in pastoral ecosystems. Newly emerged adults of the parasitoid Microctonus aethiopoides Loan (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) were supplied with guttation fluid from pot-grown ryegrasses infected with three different strains of endophyte (standard, AR37, AR1) or no endophyte collected at different times of the year, or water, sucrose solution or no liquid. Longevity was compared when individuals were held in separate vials in controlled environment room at 20oC with 16:8 h light:dark photoperiod. An enzymatic method was used to measure sugars in guttation fluid samples collected on three dates. Guttation fluid from endophyte-infected grasses was found to have no detrimental effect on M. aethiopoides longevity and to contain glucose and fructose. Guttation fluid from AR37-infected ryegrass collected in autumn increased insect longevity compared to water and fluid from standard-type infected ryegrass by 26% and 24% respectively. The lack of available food sources in New Zealand ryegrass-dominant pastures means that guttation fluid from AR37-infected ryegrass in autumn may contribute to M. aethiopoides efficacy as a biocontrol agent through enhanced longevity. © 2022 New Zealand Plant Protection Society (Inc.)",Gerard P.J.; Hiszczyńska-Sawicka E.,New Zealand Plant Protection,2022,10.30843/nzpp.2022.75.11756,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.990705569105454,TRUE,3,1,Low,no endophyte,collected,"fluid from pot-grown ryegrasses infected with three different strains of endophyte (standard, AR37, AR1) or no endophyte collected at different times of the year, or water, sucrose solution or no liquid.

2276,Symbiotic interactions as drivers of trade-offs in plants: effects of fungal endophytes on tall fescue,"Studying the controls on biomass allocation trade-offs in plants are important since they affect harvestable product yields and are critical to understanding symbiotic interactions. Epichloae fungal endophytes associate with cool-season grasses, growing systemically within the plant inter-cellular spaces and are transmitted through seeds. We explore the endophytes influence on the relationship between the plant reproductive and vegetative aboveground biomass (reproductive effort: RE) and on the trade-off between two components of the reproductive biomass, number and weight of panicles (RPN), using tall fescue as a model system. Naturally endophyte-colonized, manipulatively endophyte-free, and naturally endophyte-free plants from Northern European wild-populations together with the cultivar Kentucky-31 were grown under different environmental conditions (nutrients x water). The endophyte had an effect on the RPN (E+: 6.19, ME-: 4.68 and E-: 4.40) which indicates how reproductive biomass is partitioned into number and mass of panicles, but not on RE (a parts per thousand 0.06). As expected, wild plants showed higher reproductive effort (a parts per thousand 0.06) compared to the cultivar KY-31 (0.05), irrespective of endophyte presence. Endophyte-colonized plants had lighter panicles than endophyte-free plants, a pattern that was clear among low-yielding plants. Similarly, the trade-off between RPN and RE was higher for endophyte-colonized plants. This was again evident among plants with low RE indicating that colonized plants split the yield into either greater number of panicles and/or lighter panicles. The effect of vertically transmitted endophytes has earlier been studied as ratios (e.g. RE); however, our study shows that this approach may hide size-dependent endophyte effects on these relationships. Our study reveals that Neotyphodium endophyte affects trade-offs in tall fescue plants in a complex manner, and is influenced by a number of biological and abiotic factors.","Gundel, PE; Garibaldi, LA; Helander, M; Saikkonen, K",FUNGAL DIVERSITY,2013,10.1007/s13225-013-0224-y,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.938521521522627,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,studied,"panicles (RPN), using tall fescue as a model system.

18416,Non-nodulated bacterial leaf symbiosis promotes the evolutionary success of its host plants in the coffee family (Rubiaceae).,"Every plant species on Earth interacts in some way or another with microorganisms and it is well known that certain forms of symbiosis between different organisms can drive evolution. Within some clades of Rubiaceae (coffee family), a specific plant-bacteria interaction exists in which non-pathological endophytes are present in the leaves of their hosts. It is hypothesized that the bacterial endophytes, either alone or by interacting with the host, provide chemical protection against herbivory or pathogens by producing toxic or otherwise advantageous secondary metabolites. If the bacteria indeed have a direct beneficial influence on their hosts, it is reasonable to assume that the endophytes may increase the fitness of their hosts and therefore it is probable that their presence also has an influence on the long-term evolution of the particular plant lineages. In this study, the possible origin in time of non-nodulated bacterial leaf symbiosis in the Vanguerieae tribe of Rubiaceae is elucidated and dissimilarities in evolutionary dynamics between species with endophytes versus species without are investigated. Bacterial leaf symbiosis is shown to have most probably originated in the Late Miocene, a period when the savannah habitat is believed to have expanded on the African continent and herbivore pressure increased. The presence of bacterial leaf endophytes appears to be restricted to Old World lineages so far. Plant lineages with leaf endophytes show a significantly higher speciation rate than plant lineages without endophytes, while there is only a small difference in extinction rate. The transition rate shows that evolving towards having endophytes is twice as fast as evolving towards not having endophytes, suggesting that leaf symbiosis must be beneficial for the host plants. We conclude that the presence of bacterial leaf endophytes may also be an important driver for speciation of host plants.",Verstraete B; Janssens S; Rønsted N,Molecular phylogenetics and evolution,2017,10.1016/j.ympev.2017.05.022,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.989440664007208,TRUE,3,1,Low,without endophytes,investigated,NA,NA,direct_absence,investigation_methods
20859,Effects of endophyte infection on ecophysiological response of perennial ryegrass under phosphorus deficiency,"Neotyphodìum endophytes and cool-season grasses are mutualistic symbionts. The host grasses provide necessary photosynthates for the fungi. The endophytes often enhance the hosts' growth and protect them from biotic and abiotic stresses, contributing to their widespread adaptability. Abiotic attributes affected by Neotyphodìum endophytes include drought resistance, light, temperature and mineral stresses. Studies on endophyte-related responses of grasses to nutrient acquisition have focused upon the influence of soil nitrogen (N) availability, since this element is a constituent of alkaloids in infected plants. Similar to N nutrition, phosphorus (P) availability influences ergot alkaloid production in EI (endophyte-infected) grasses. But reports of endophyte-related responses of grasses to P nutrition are relatively limited. In this paper, Lolium perenne L. cv. SR4000 infected by Neotyphodìum lolii (originally from Beijing Clover Seed Company, China) was employed to establish EF (endophyte-free) and EI populations. EI and EF ryegrasses were grown in the field and tested for their ecophysiological response to P deficiency. The experiment was carried out at the campus experiment site of Nankai University, Tianjin. There were two separate 2-month periods of P stress treatment. The first began in mid July. The second began in late Sept. Two-factor randomized-block design was used. The first factor was P treatment and two levels of P treatments were imposed, i.e. P supply (P+) and P deficiency (P-); the other factor was endophyte status, i.e. EI and EF. Each treatment was replicated five times. P+ treatment was achieved by addition of P to the soil in the form of Hoagland nutrient solution. For P-treatment, 2000μM KC1 was added instead of KH2PO4. Two liters nutrient solution per pot was added once a month, and four times in total. The results showed that endophyte infection did not have significant effect on leaf growth but did improve root development of perennial ryegrass under P deficiency. In response to P deficiency, EI roots were longer and had higher mass than EF roots. The root: shoot ratio was also greater in EI individuals. The content of total phenolics and organic acids was greater in EI roots than in EF roots at low P supply. However, the concentration of both did not increase with endophyte infection. The results suggest that higher root dry weight contributes to higher content of total phenolics and organic acids for EI plants, and endophyte infection might have negligible effects on chemical modification of perennial ryegrass. Endophyte infection did not increase the rate of P uptake but did improve P use efficiency when P was limited. Higher P use efficiency of EI ryegrass might result from higher acid phosphatase activity (APA) for EI ryegrass. Higher APA may contribute to ryegrass ability to reuse a limited P source, which is further beneficial to the development of ryegrass roots.",Ren A.-Z.; Gao Y.-B.; Zhou F.; Chen L.,Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica,2007,NA,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.950761089037124,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,tested,NA,EF (endophyte-free) and EI populations.

In the present study, we evaluated the first generation of self-pollination derived plants of endophyte infected clones (EIS1) from putative genotypes 75B+ and 75C+ and those from the first generation of self-pollination in six commercial tall fescue clones plus their hybrids with 75B- and 75C- for growth, seed yield and polyphenolic content as an index for biosynthesis of defence compounds under field conditions. The results showed that EIS1 had high hyphal density within leaf sheaths and higher growth and seed-related traits in at least one genotype. There were higher amounts of flavonoid and phenolic compounds (up to twofold) in both genotypes than in their hybrid counterparts and endophyte-free progeny.

The first study evaluated the effects of feeding diets containing increasing levels of endophyte-infected tall fescue seed (E+) and decreasing levels of endophyte-free tall fescue seed (E-). The second and third study evaluated the response to a diet that contained synthetic EV added to an E- diet and the response to a diet containing endophyte-infected ryegrass seed (R+) with an elevated concentration of EV. In Exp. 1, lambs were fed diets of: 1) 10% E- and 0% E+, 2) 5% E- and 5% E+, or 3) 0% E- and 10% E+. Increasing the percentage of E+ in the diet resulted in a linear decrease (P < 0.01) in feed intake (as-fed basis), skin temperature, thermocirculation index (TCI), and serum prolactin. Body weight gain also decreased (P < 0.06). Respiratory rate and core body temperature were not affected by the 5 or 10% E+ diets. In Exp. 2, lambs were fed diets that contained: 1) 10% E-, 2) 10% E- with synthetic EV added at a level equivalent to the 10% E+ diet, or 3) 10% E+. Feed intake (as-fed basis), body weight gain, and skin temperature did not differ for lambs fed the E- and EV diets. The EV diet elicited a decrease (P < 0.05) in TCI and prolactin compared with the E- diet. The TCI for lambs fed EV did not differ (P > 0.10) from the E+ lambs; however, serum prolactin was lower (P < 0.05) for lambs on the E+ diet than for those fed EV. Core body temperature was not affected (P > 0.10) by feeding EV or E+ fescue seed in Exp. 2.

There were 48 steers at each location in each year (n = 240) in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement with two replications at each location. Steers in Virginia were Angus and Angus x Hereford with initial weights of 245 kg (SD = 20), 234 kg (SD = 9), and 265 kg (SD = 5) in yr 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Steers in Mississippi were 3/4 Angus and 1/4 Brahman and weighed 230 kg (SD = 8) and 250 kg (SD = 2) in yr 2 and 3, respectively. Tasco (3.4 kg/ha) was dissolved in water and applied to pastures in April before grazing was begun and again in July at the same rate. The grazing period was from mid-April to late September or mid-October. Total gains were higher (P < 0.05) for steers grazing uninfected than for those grazing endophyte-infected tall fescue. Rectal temperatures were increased (P < 0.05) due to endophyte infection at both locations; Tasco application decreased temperature of steers grazing infected fescue in Virginia (interaction, P < 0.07) but increased temperatures of steers grazing infected fescue in Mississippi (interaction, P < 0.05).

16321,The growth promotion in endophyte symbiotic plants does not penalise the resistance to herbivores and bacterial microbiota,"A trade-off between growth and defence against biotic stresses is common in plants. Fungal endophytes of the genus Epichloë may relieve this trade-off in their host grasses since they can simultaneously induce plant growth and produce antiherbivore alkaloids that circumvent the need for host defence. The Epichloë ability to decouple the growth-defence trade-off was evaluated by subjecting ryegrass with and without Epichloë endophytes to an exogenous treatment with gibberellin (GA) followed by a challenge with Rhopalosiphum padi aphids. In agreement with the endophyte-mediated trade-off decoupling hypothesis, the GA-derived promotion of plant growth increased the susceptibility to aphids in endophyte-free plants but did not affect the insect resistance in endophyte-symbiotic plants. In line with the unaltered insect resistance, the GA treatment did not reduce the concentration of Epichloë-derived alkaloids. The Epichloë mycelial biomass was transiently increased by the GA treatment but at the expense of hyphal integrity. The response of the phyllosphere bacterial microbiota to both GA treatment and Epichloë was also evaluated. Only Epichloë, and not the GA treatment, altered the composition of the phyllosphere microbiota and the abundance of certain bacterial taxa. Our findings clearly demonstrate that Epichloë does indeed relieve the plant growth-defence trade-off. © 2024 The Authors.

16214,Endophyte effects on drought tolerance of turf-type tall fescue,"The response of tall fescue [Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.) Dumort.], infected with fungal endophytes, and subjected to drought stress has varied, presumably due to variability in host–endophyte associations. Much of this research has focused on forage ecotypes; less is known about the effects of endophytes on managed turfgrasses. The objective of these trials was to determine if the presence of fungal endophytes in turf-type tall fescue provides an advantage to the host grass when exposed to drought conditions. Five endophyte-free and endophyte-infected field populations were established in Fayetteville, AR, and Albany, OR. A greenhouse trial was also established in Albany. Turf was subjected to drought and lightbox photos were evaluated to determine days until 75%, 50%, and 25% green cover.

2516,HERBICIDES WITH CROP COMPETITION REPLACE ENDOPHYTIC TALL FESCUE (FESTUCA-ARUNDINACEA),"Herbicides and interim summer crop treatments were studied in 1984 to 1987 to replace fungal endophyte-infected with endophyte-free tall fescue or red clover to improve forage quality. Foliar glyphosate or paraquat were applied in spring across interim crops with PRE herbicides. The interim crops, grain sorghum with atrazine, sorghum-sudangrass hybrid with metribuzin, or soybean with imazaquin, were each applied as confounded treatments across glyphosate or paraquat. Within an interim crop system, a follow-up glyphosate treatment was serially applied the next fall or spring. Then either red clover or endophyte-free tall fescue was spring drilled within the fall or spring glyphosate follow-up treatments. Glyphosate controlled old tall fescue better than paraquat, and improved the stand of the endophyte-free tall fescue. Control of tall fescue was 97% from 1.7 kg ai/ha glyphosate. Glyphosate reduced the endophyte from a 77% original infection level to 20% over all interim crops after drilling the endophyte-free tall fescue. Among interim crops, grain sorghum or the sorghum-sudangrass hybrid was more competitive than soybean with the uncontrolled tall fescue. Replacement with endophyte-free tall fescue was best in grain sorghum or sorghum-sudangrass hybrid stubble the next spring. Grain sorghum or sorghum-sudangrass hybrid following foliar glyphosate or paraquat treatment of endophyte-infected tall fescue reduced endophyte infection level in tall fescue to 28%. A follow-up fall treatment with glyphosate controlled tall fescue better than the spring retreatment and red clover and endophyte-free tall fescue were established better from fall retreated glyphosate.

18077,Ergot alkaloid exposure during gestation alters: II. Uterine and umbilical artery vasoactivity1.,"Previous research has shown that livestock exposed to ergot alkaloids results in decreased vasoactivity of gastrointestinal and peripheral vasculature. Little is known regarding the effect ergot alkaloid exposure during gestation may have on vasculature supporting the fetus. The objective of this study was to evaluate contractile responses of uterine and umbilical arteries collected from ewes consuming ergot alkaloids during gestation. On day 35 of gestation, 36 Suffolk ewes (78.24 ± 9.5 kg) were assigned to endophyte-infected (E+) or endophyte-free (E-) tall fescue seed treatments that were fed either throughout or switched on day 86 of gestation, creating four seed treatments E+E+, E+E-, E-E+, and E-E-. Ewes were fed E+ tall fescue seed to provide 1.77 mg of total ergovaline ⋅ hd-1 ⋅ d-1 with E- ewes receiving the same quantity of E- seed. Gestation was terminated on day 133, and sections of uterine artery and umbilical cord were surgically collected. Only collections from 28 ewes (n = 7/treatment) were of sufficient viability to proceed with the contractility experiments. Arteries were cleaned, sliced into 2-mm cross sections, and suspended in multi-myograph chambers containing 5 mL of continuously oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Vessels were exposed to increasing concentrations (5 × 10-8 to 1 × 10-4 M) of norepinephrine, serotonin, ergotamine, and ergovaline (5 × 10-9 to 1 × 10-5M; extract of tall fescue seed) in 15-min intervals. Increasing concentrations of norepinephrine generated a contractile response by the uterine artery (P < 0.05), but no response in the umbilical artery. Increasing concentrations of serotonin resulted in negligible responses in uterine preparations, whereas umbilical artery preparations were responsive (P < 0.05) to serotonin. Ewes receiving E+E+ and E-E+ treatments had decreased vasoactivity in umbilical arteries to serotonin with a dextral shift in concentrations where the response curve initiated (P < 0.05). Interestingly, uterine arteries were not responsive to exposure to ergotamine or ergovaline, whereas umbilical arteries were responsive (P < 0.05). Umbilical arteries collected from ewes receiving E-E- and E+E- were more vasoactive to ergot alkaloids (P < 0.05) than other treatments.

14920,Endophytic Fungal Infection of Meadow Fescue in the Driftless Area of the Upper Mississippi River Valley: Impacts on Agronomic Fitness,"Meadow fescue, Schedonorus pratensis (Huds.) P. Beauv., has recently been discovered as a common but previously unknown pasture grass in the Driftless Area of the upper Mississippi River Valley, USA. Preliminary data also indicated that many meadow fescue pastures were infected with an endophytic fungus, Epichloë uncinata (W. Gams, Petrini & D. Schmidt) Leuchtm. & Schardl. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine if the endophyte impacts agronomic fitness of the host meadow fescue. Meadow fescue plants from eight farm sites were intensively sampled, and endophyte infection levels were determined to range from 82 to 95%. Paired endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E−) meadow fescue subpopulations from each collection site were then created, and were subsequently compared for greenhouse and field drought tolerance, forage mass, and persistence under frequent defoliation. There was no impact of the endophyte under a wide range of drought conditions for either greenhouse or field studies. Furthermore, there was a small forage-mass-enhancement effect in the E+ subpopulation for only one of the eight collection sites. The only consistent effect was an average of 9% increased ground cover (persistence) in endophyte-infected meadow fescue under frequent defoliation. As per other studies, enhanced root growth, fungal-disease resistance, and/or reduced insect feeding could be mechanisms for this increased survivorship. We conclude that the meadow fescue endophytes present in the Driftless Area do not help protect their host from drought or provide any consistent forage-growth enhancement; however, we found evidence that the endophyte provides some protection against frequent defoliation at low residual sward heights. © 2023 by the authors.",Casler M.D.; Waldron B.L.,Grasses,2023,10.3390/grasses2040019,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99068319691481,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,sampled,"endophyte infection levels were determined to range from 82 to 95%.

20732,Physiological ecological effect of endophyte infection on Achnatherum sibiricum under drought stress,"Endophytes and their host grasses are mutually symbiotic. On one hand, the host grasses provide necessary photosynthates for the fungi; on the other hand, endophyte-infected grasses express a range of adaptations to biotic and abiotic stresses, including drought, mineral imbalance, and soil acidity. Cool-season grasses infected with Neotyphodium endophytes have an extraordinary impact on the ecology and economy of pasture and turf. In this paper, Achnatherum sibiricum infected by Neotyphodium lolii was employed to establish endophyte-free (EF) and endophyte-infected (EI) populations. EI and EF Achnatherum sibiricum were grown in the field and tested for their ecophysiolocal response to water deficiency. Relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll, soluble sugar and protective enzymes of EI and EF populations under normal and drought stress conditions were calculated. The experiment was carried out on the campus of Nankai University, Tianjin. The stress treatment began in mid-June and ended in mid-July, over a time span of 35 days. All experimental plants were watered to saturation before the experiment. During the treatment, half of the plants were served as the control group, they were watered once or twice a day. The remaining plants were subjected to drought-stress treatment. Every morning, a soil moisture probe (ECH2 O Check, Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA) was inserted to a 5 cm depth into each pot to record the volumetric water content percentage, i. e., the amount of total soil volume consisting of water. Control plants were watered to maintain field capacity, i. e., soil moisture readings at 35%. For plants in the drought treatment, sufficient water was added to keep the soil moisture readings between 5% and 10%. The results showed that endophyte infection had no significant effect on the host's vegetative growth, total biomass, chlorophyll content. On the other hand, it has a favorable effect on the host's maintenance of photochemical efficiency (Fv/ Fm), and made a contribution to keep the stability of photosystem II. Endophyte infection had no significant effect on Fv/ Fm in the control treatment, but enhanced the Fv/Fm of the host plant significantly under drought stress. At the same time, endophyte infection alleviated the drought injury on the cell membrane of the host grass, i. e. endophyte infection reduced the production of malondialdehyde (MDA). Endophyte infection did not improve the activity of protective enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), while the carotenoid content of the EI plants was significantly higher than that of the EF plants under drought stress. Therefore, we suggested that under drought stress, endophyte infection may alleviate the adverse effect mainly through non-enzyme systems instead of protective enzymes. Others studies have showed that the endophyte promotes host natural grass tolerance of drought mainly by two mechanisms: (1) by changing the morphological and physiological characteristic of the host plants to help them maintain a reasonable growth rate under drought stress; (2) the endophyte enables plant tissues to withstand water deficits, but as a trade-off, the endophyte reduces the host plant's growth. In our study, the endophyte infection did not have a significant effect on the host plant's vegetative growth and biomass accumulation under drought stress, but did remit the drought damage to some extent. We suggest that endophyte may enable plants invest more in structural carbohydrates such as lignin and fiber to help host plant overcome the resource-limited environment. Thus, it will be interesting to determine whether endophyte infection contributes to greater investment in structural carbohydrates in plants.",Han R.; Li X.; Ren A.; Gao Y.,Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica,2011,NA,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.95788013789076,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,tested,"and turf.

17508,Effects of novel and wild-type endophytes in perennial ryegrass on cow health and production.,"To measure the effects of AR37, AR1 and Wild-type endophytes in perennial ryegrass on cow health and milk production. Four indoor and six grazing experiments were used to evaluate a perennial ryegrass cultivar containing either novel (AR37, AR1) or Wild-type (HE or Standard) endophytes or no endophyte (Nil). Three hectares of each ryegrass/endophyte association were sown with a white clover cultivar in April 2005 and either grazed or cut for indoor feeding from July 2005 to March 2009. The novel endophytes were distinguished by the production of epoxy-janthitrems by AR37 and peramine only by AR1, both of which deter insect attack. This is the first assessment of the effects of AR37 endophyte on dairy cow health and production. In all experiments, cows were monitored for indications of ryegrass staggers (RGS) by visual scoring, respiration rate as an indicator of heat stress and, in some instances, packed cell volume (blood haematocrit), blood serum albumin concentrations and skin elasticity as indicators of dehydration. Milk production and composition were measured routinely. Pasture production, composition and alkaloid content were determined, as well as temperature and humidity in the indoor feeding facility. Indoor experiments enabled accurate measurement of dry matter intakes, as well as water consumption in some instances. Cows eating AR37 or AR1 ryegrass did not develop RGS. During indoor feeding experiments in summer and autumn, cows eating ryegrass infected with Wild-type (Wild-type ryegrass) always developed RGS, while under rotational grazing, onset of RGS was less predictable and rarely affected all animals in the group. Severity of RGS was related to the concentration of lolitrem B in ryegrass. No cows demonstrated signs of extreme heat stress in any situation. During summer indoor feeding, cows eating ryegrass infected with AR1 endophyte (AR1 ryegrass) sometimes produced more milk and milksolids (MS) compared to ryegrass infected with AR37 (AR37 ryegrass). The dry matter intakes of cows fed AR37 ryegrass were sometimes higher than those fed AR1, and intakes were lowest when Wild-type ryegrass was fed. Water intakes of cows fed Wild-type ryegrass indoors were lower than those of cows fed AR1 or AR37 ryegrass in two of the three summer indoor experiments. The cows fed AR1 ryegrass indoors always produced more MS than cows fed Wild-type ryegrass. Under grazing, the same trends were detected, but production over three full lactations was similar for AR1 and AR37 ryegrass. The absence of animal health and management problems, especially RGS, makes the novel endophytes AR37 and AR1 attractive alternatives to Wild-type ryegrass. Total MS production over three consecutive lactations was not affected by endophyte treatment.

4149,OVIPOSITION AND DEVELOPMENT OF FACE FLIES IN DUNG FROM CATTLE ON HERBAGE AND SUPPLEMENTED HERBAGE DIETS,"Dung was collected from Angus cattle (Bos taurus L.) fed (ad libitum) hays of endophyte-free (EF) and endophyte (Acremonium coenophialum Morgan-Jones and Gams) infected (EI) tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and alfalfa-smooth bromegrass (1:1 w/w) and green-chopped Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.). Samples of dung were subsequently collected from the same animals offered the same herbage diets supplemented each day with ground maize (Zea mays L.) kernels at 0.35 kg per 100 kg body weight. Dung from both sources were used in bioassays to establish oviposition preferences of face flies (Musca autumnalis De Geer). When offered dung from herbage diets, face flies deposited 38.3% of their eggs on dung derived from EF tall fescue diets, 9.9% on dung from EI tall fescue diets, 21.0% on dung from alfalfa diets, 7.4% on dung from red clover diets and 22.8% on dung from alfalfa-bromegrass diets. Face flies avoided ovipositing in dung from cattle ingesting bromegrass hay and Kentucky bluegrass green-chop. Supplements increased oviposition preference of face flies for dung from cattle ingesting Kentucky bluegrass greenchop to 19.1% at the expense of oviposition on dung from cattle ingesting alfalfa hay diets (4.5%), otherwise, they had little effect on oviposition preference ranking. Growth and development of first instar larvae of face flies was also measured in bioassays of dung from cattle on herbage and supplemented herbage diets.

16728,"Effects of elevated ultraviolet radiation and endophytic fungi on plant growth and insect feeding in Lolium perenne, Festuca rubra, F. arundinacea and F. pratensis.","Plants of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), red fescue (Festuca rubra L.), tall fescue (F. arundinacea Schreb.) and meadow fescue (F. pratensis Huds) were exposed at an outdoor facility located in Edinburgh, UK to modulated levels of UV-B radiation (280-315 nm) using banks of cellulose diacetate filtered UV-B fluorescent lamps that also produce UV-A radiation (315-400 nm). The plants were derived from a single clone of each species and were grown both with and without colonization by naturally-occurring fungal endophytes. The UV-B treatment was a 30% elevation above the ambient erythemally-weighted level of UV-B during July to October. Growth of treated plants was compared with plants grown under elevated UV-A radiation alone produced by banks of polyester filtered lamps and with plants grown at ambient levels of solar radiation under banks of unenergized lamps. At the end of the treatment period, sample leaves were collected for feeding trials with the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria (Forsk). The UV-B treatment produced no effects on the aboveground biomass of any of the four grasses. The UV-B treatment and the UV-A control exposure both increased plant height and the number of daughter plants formed by rhizome growth in F. rubra. There were significant effects of endophyte presence on the total fresh and dry weights of F. arundinacea and F. rubra, on fresh weight only in F. pratensis, and on the fresh and dry weights of inflorescence in F. arundinacea and L. perenne. There were no effects of UV treatments on the absolute amounts of leaf consumed or on the feeding preferences of locusts for leaves with or without endophyte in three species: F. rubra, F. arundinacea and L. perenne. In F. pratensis there was no effect of UV treatment on the weight of leaves consumed but a significant UV x endophyte interaction caused by a marked change in feeding preference between leaves with and without endophyte that differed between the UV-B treatment and UV-A control exposures.

12306,Evaluation of cool- and warm-season grasses for resistance to multiple chinch bug (Hemiptera: Blissidae) species,"Chinch bugs are common pests of many agronomic and horticulturally important crops and turfgrasses.

The results of this research showed the buffalograsses evaluated, including B. occiduus-resistant Prestige, are moderately to highly susceptible to the three other chinch bug species. In contrast, B. occiduus did not cause considerable damage to any of the turfgrasses or sorghum cultivars evaluated, other than buffalograss, irrespective of whether or not they are resistant to another chinch bug species. This information is increasingly important as various grasses become adapted to regions that may possess chinch bug species other than those with which they are typically associated.

Given that the proportion of infected tall fescue plants in the grasslands of the Flooding Pampa (Argentina) has been progressively increasing, it is proposed that endophytes confer tolerance to the stresses characteristic of that environment, especially flooding. Plants from a naturalized population and a commercial cultivar were grown, both with and without endophyte (wild type and AR584 respectively). The plants were subjected to two submergence treatments (i.e., control and partial submergence) in two development stages (5-leaf stage and beginning of the elongation of internodes). Plant performance (aerial and root biomass, root aerenchyma formation, total root length and root diameter, proportion of reproductive tillers, number of panicles and seeds produced) and endophyte transmission to progeny were evaluated. Endophytes did not alter the ecological fitness of plants under partial submergence. Independently of the water condition, the symbiosis was linked to low biomass in plants from the naturalized population, while the opposite occurred in plants from the cultivar. Partial submergence did not affect the germination of the seeds produced, nor the transmission of the endophyte to the seedlings that originated from them. Our work suggests that the invasion ability of tall fescue in the Flooding Pampa grasslands is not related to an endophyte-mediated improvement of plants to tolerate water excess.","Petigrosso, LR; Vignolio, OR; Gundel, PE; Monterubbianesi, MG; Assuero, SG",AUSTRAL ECOLOGY,2024,10.1111/aec.13545,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.884866556253103,TRUE,3,1,Low,without endophyte,evaluated,"flooding.

16478,Performance of young endophyte-free and endophyte-infected tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) plants under partial and total submergence,"Context. Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is a valuable temperate forage grass. Tall fescue plants associated with Epichloë fungal endophytes are successfully spreading in grassland regions that are recurrently exposed to flooding. Aims. We asked whether the association with fungal endophytes increases plant performance under water excess. Methods. In a greenhouse experiment, we evaluated the differential performance of young endophyte-infected and endophyte-free tall fescue plants in response to 14 days of partial and total submergence. We included a wild local population and a cultivar, each with their respective fungal endophyte: the common endophyte and a safe (non-toxic) endophyte (AR584). Key results. Relative to control (non-submerged) plants, and regardless of endophyte status, total submergence resulted in a significant growth reduction. At the end of the partial submergence period, the number of leaves per plant increased (21%) in the presence of the safe endophyte AR584 but decreased (18%) in the presence of the wild endophyte. Moreover, under partial submergence, the presence of wild endophyte decreased pseudostem dry weight by 10%. Conclusions. Our results show that the presence of either the wild or the safe endophyte did not increase the performance of young tall fescue plants under submergence conditions. Implications. Although all endophyte-free and endophyte-infected tall fescue plants survived submergence treatments, we cannot rule out that Epichloë endophytes might improve plant fitness under longer stressful submergence conditions.

The hydroponic experiment showed that endophyte infection significantly increased tiller and leaf number, which led to an increase in the total biomass of the host grass. Endophyte infection enhanced Na accumulation in the host grass and improved Na transport from the roots to the shoots. With a 15g l(-1) NaCl treatment, the phytoextraction efficiency of EI tall fescue was 2.34-fold higher than EF plants. When the plants were grown in saline soils, endophyte infection also significantly increased tiller number, shoot height and the total biomass of the host grass.

We investigated the influence of endophyte infection and water deficit on osmotic adjustment, stomatal conductance, tiller survival and leaf elongation rate of genotype GA87-122 and cv. Kentucky-31 (KY31) of tall fescue. Plants were grown in a greenhouse in pots containing fine-silty topsoil (experiment 1) or sand (experiment 2). In expt 1, endophyte-infected (EI) and endophyte-free (EF) isolines of GA87-122 were exposed to two drought preconditioning cycles, after which all pots were re-watered and osmotic adjustment determined. Osmotic adjustment was -0.46 and -0.51 MPa in EI leaf blades and tiller bases and -0.29 and -0.13 MPa in EF leaf blades and tiller bases, respectively. In expt 2, EI and EF GA87-122 and KY31 were exposed to severe drought after two preconditioning cycles, then re-watered. During the second preconditioning drying cycle of KY31, stomatal conductance tended to be lower in EI than in EF plants, but the difference was significant (P less than or equal to 0.05) only at two sampling times.

3321,The effect of endophyte presence on Schedonorus arundinaceus (tall fescue) establishment varies with grassland community structure,"The endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum in Schedonorus arundinaceus (tall fescue) may alter host interactions with specific resident species or shift the host's niche. These effects can be quantified by assessing tall fescue responses to, and effects on, the variation among resident species (selection) and resident species interactions (complementarity). To determine how N. coenophialum affects tall fescue, grassland microcosms containing 16 transplants of two, four, or eight resident species were seeded with endophyte-infected (E+) or endophyte-free (E-) Kentucky-31 (KY-31) tall fescue. All resident species were also grown in monoculture. Aboveground biomass was harvested 9 weeks after tall fescue was added (18 weeks' total growth). At harvest, more E+ than E- individuals were present and they represented a larger portion of the aboveground biomass across richness treatments, despite similar germination in concurrent trials. Tall fescue individuals were larger in microcosms dominated by more productive resident species (greater selection). In contrast, fewer E-, but not E+, individuals were present in microcosms with more facilitative interactions among the resident species (greater complementarity). E- and E+ tall fescue also affected resident species differently. High-richness E+ microcosms were more diverse and less dominated by productive species (lower selection) than E- microcosms. Thus, E+ KY-31 may more readily establish in, and affect, species-rich, functionally diverse communities as a result of niche shifts during establishment and negative effects on specific resident species.

7114,Fungal endophytes and phytochemistry of oak foliage: Determinants of oviposition preference of leafminers?,"Sedentary insect herbivores, such as gallformers and leafminers, are usually non-randomly distributed among and within host plants. Dispersion of these insects is largely a function of female oviposition choice. In field experiments and observations spanning two growing seasons, we tested the hypothesis that selective oviposition on individual leaves within trees by the dominant herbivore of Emery oak, the monophagous leafminer Cameraria sp. nov., is determined by the probability of colonization by endophytic fungi. These fungi are alleged to act as plant mutualists by deterring, killing, or inhibiting the growth of insect herbivores. We found that leaves selected by females for oviposition and paired, unmined leaves were equally likely to be colonized by fungal endophytes. Furthermore, condensed and hydrolyzable tannin levels, purported inhibitors of fungal infection, and protein content did not vary between leaves selected by females and unmined leaves, or between leaves with and without endophyte infections. We conclude that female Cameraria do not choose leaves within toes for oviposition on the basis of propensity for endophytic fungal infection or on phytochemical parameters that might indicate probability of future infections. At this spatial scale at least, fungal endophytes do not explain the highly aggregated distribution of Cameraria among leaves and associated costs in terms of increased larval mortality. Fungal endophytes may, nevertheless, affect leafminer dispersion and abundance at larger spatial scales, such as host plant populations or species. We did find, however, that the amount of mining activity on leaves is positively associated with increased colonization by fungal endophytes. We suggest that mining activity increases endophyte fungal infections by facilitating spore germination and hyphal penetration into the leaf or by altering leaf phytochemistry. The facilitation of endophyte colonization by leafmining activity coupled with the lack of predictability of endophyte infections based on leaf phytochemistry and almost 100% infectivity of all oak leaves during sporadic wet years may prevent female leafminers from discriminating leaves for oviposition on the basis of current or future levels of endophytes in leaves.","Faeth, SH; Hammon, KE",OECOLOGIA,1996,10.1007/BF00329049,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996704314488434,TRUE,3,1,Low,without endophyte,tested,"not vary between leaves selected by females and unmined leaves, or between leaves with and without endophyte infections.

Through a manipulative experiment, we evaluated the performance of endophyte-free and endophyte-associated Lolium multiflorum plants grown in soils previously conditioned by endophyte-free and endophyte-associated plants and inoculated or not with three AMF species. The biomass of endophyte-free and endophyte-associated plants was increased by AMF inoculation, when growing in soils conditioned by equal endophytic status plants (i.e. home soils). When growing in soils conditioned by plants with different endophytic status, plant biomass was higher than in home soil only in absence of AMF. The content of P and the arbuscular colonization also increased in plants growing in home soils. We demonstrated that AMF shift the intraspecific feedback effects between E+ and E- conspecific plants from negative to positive.

1888,Connecting plant-microbial interactions above and belowground: a fungal endophyte affects decomposition,"Mutualisms can strongly affect the structure of communities, but their influence on ecosystem processes is not well resolved. Here we show that a plant-microbial mutualism affects the rate of leaf litter decomposition using the widespread interaction between tall fescue grass (Lolium arundinaceum) and the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum. In grasses, fungal endophytes live symbiotically in the aboveground tissues, where the fungi gain protection and nutrients from their host and often protect host plants from biotic and abiotic stress. In a field experiment, decomposition rate depended on a complex interaction between the litter source (collected from endophyte-infected or endophyte-free plots), the decomposition microenvironment (endophyte-infected or endophyte-free plots), and the presence of mesoinvertebrates (manipulated by the mesh size of litter bags). Over all treatments, decomposition was slower for endophyte-infected fescue litter than for endophyte-free litter. When mesoinvertebrates were excluded using fine mesh and litter was placed in a microenvironment with the endophyte, the difference between endophyte-infected and endophyte-free litter was strongest. In the presence of mesoinvertebrates, endophyte-infected litter decomposed faster in microenvironments with the endophyte than in microenvironments lacking the endophyte, suggesting that plots differ in the detritivore assemblage. Indeed, the presence of the endophyte in plots shifted the composition of Collembola, with more Hypogastruridae in the presence of the endophyte and more Isotomidae in endophyte-free plots. In a separate outdoor pot experiment, we did not find strong effects of the litter source or the soil microbial/microinvertebrate community on decomposition, which may reflect differences between pot and field conditions or other differences in methodology.

9311,"Climate drivers, host identity and fungal endophyte infection determine virus prevalence in a grassland ecosystem","Under climate change, alterations to precipitation and temperature regimes are expected to impact ecosystem structure and function. These impacts may in part be determined by feedbacks between plants and associated microbes, including both endophytic fungal symbionts and viral pathogens. To test potential key components of these feedbacks in a grassland system, we conducted a field experiment that factorially manipulated temperature regime, precipitation regime and endophyte infection of a dominant species, Schedonorus arundinaceus. After one growing season, we evaluated the four most frequently occurring grass species for infection by three species of barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (B/CYDVs). For S.arundinaceus, we also tracked changes in viral prevalence over an additional two growing seasons, for a total of three growing seasons. Plant species identity played a strong role in determining virus prevalence; Poa pratensis and Paspalum dilatatum were more frequently infected than either S.arundinaceus (endophyte infected or endophyte free) or Eleusine indica. Both elevated temperature and elevated precipitation impacted virus prevalence, but effects varied among years and interacted with fungal endophyte symbiosis for S.arundinaceus. In the final year of data collection, elevated precipitation increased virus prevalence in endophyte-infected, but not endophyte-free, S.arundinaceus. In the same year, but regardless of endophyte infection, elevated temperature by itself increased virus prevalence for S.arundinaceus. This effect of temperature on virus prevalence may have been driven by vector abundance because the viruses are obligately aphid-transmitted, and aphids were found more frequently in heated plots. Synthesis. Overall, our investigation experimentally demonstrates strong combined impacts of biotic and abiotic factors on disease dynamics in a grassland system. Impacts of climate change on virus prevalence in grasslands may depend on the responses of aphid vectors and the presence of endophytic fungal symbionts.","Rúa, MA; McCulley, RL; Mitchell, CE",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2014,10.1111/1365-2745.12238,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.965965047474238,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,evaluated,NA,"regime and endophyte infection of a dominant species, Schedonorus arundinaceus.

Cool-season grasses can be simultaneously infected by foliar fungal endophytes and colonised by mycorrhizal fungi, the integrated functions of which are strong predictors of plant fitness within grassland ecosystems. Evidence has been presented previously that infection of grass species with foliar endophytes can negatively affect mycorrhizal colonisation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that mycorrhizal colonisation in turn adversely affects Neotyphodium endophyte concentrations and that the competitive interaction between the two endosymbionts is affected by resource supply. 2. Specifically, we report how competition between Glomus (G. mosseae - GM, G. intraradices GI) mycorrhizal fungi and N. lolii (common strain (CS) and AR1) foliar endophytic strains is affected by P supply and water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content in two Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) cultivars: a high sugar grass, AberDart, and a conventional (control) grass, Fennema. 3. The presence of Glomus mycorrhizae reduced the concentrations of endophytes and alkaloids in leaf blades and pseudostems. The reduction depended on P supply, ryegrass cultivar (notably WSC content) and endophyte strain. Conversely, foliar endophyte infection reduced mycorrhizal colonisation rates and concentrations in the roots of the control cultivar Fennema, although not in the high sugar cultivar, AberDart. 4. Neither GM nor N. lolii infection had an effect per se on the yield of root or blade compared with mycorrhiza-free (M-) and endophyte-free (E-) plants, respectively; though, yield of roots and blades was reduced by GI infection and at low P. 5. Competitive interactions between ecologically widespread foliar endophytes (valuable for plant protection) and mycorrhizal endosymbionts (valuable for P acquisition) as seen in this study are of critical importance especially in areas of high pest prevalence and low P availability. Our work stresses the need for elucidating the physiological/metabolic basis for such interactions between endosymbionts to understand how these processes contribute to plant performance and fitness in grassland ecosystems.","Liu, QH; Parsons, AJ; Xue, H; Fraser, K; Ryan, GD; Newman, JA; Rasmussen, S",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,2011,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2011.01853.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.910472260892643,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,tested,"effect per se on the yield of root or blade compared with mycorrhiza-free (M-) and endophyte-free (E-) plants, respectively; though, yield of roots and blades was reduced by GI infection and","that infection of grass species with foliar endophytes can negatively affect mycorrhizal colonisation.

4586,A new method for the determination of lolitrem B in plant materials,"The endophyte fungus Neotyphodium lolii is associated with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L) and can lead to the production of tremorgenic mycotoxins like lolitrem B, which is responsible for ""Ryegrass staggers"", a disease in sheep, cattle and horses. We present a new simple, rapid, sensitive method to quantify lolitrem B in seeds and vegetative tissue. Lolitrem B is extracted using dichloromethane, purified on a solid-phase extraction (SPE) column and analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a silicon column and a fluorimetric detector. This method is repeatable, reproducible, and linear at a concentration of 50-500 mu g of lolitrem B/kg dry matter (DM) in seeds and hay. The limit of quantification was 50 mu g of lolitrem B/kg DM. The mean recovery rates were 59.4 and 85.9% in seeds and hay, respectively. The method was applied to seeds and vegetative tissue collected in 2010 in France.

3466,Reinfestation of endophtye-infected tall fescue in renovated endophyte-free pastures under rotational stocking,"Endophyte-infected (E+) tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) S.J. Darbyshire] is problematic in pastures because it produces alkaloids that can be toxic to cattle (Bos taurus). Replacement of E + tall fescue pasture with endophyte-free (E -) fescue may effectively eliminate this problem. Endophyte-free cultivars, however, are less competitive than E+ fescue and are usually displaced over time. The main objective of this study was to determine whether E + fescue would reinfest pastures planted with mixtures of E- fescue and other species and grazed under rotational stocking. In 2001, nine tall fescue pastures in western Illinois were renovated and planted with mixtures that contained E- fescue (Barcel) and two, four, or seven additional species. Pastures were grazed by beef cattle over 3 yr. Tall fescue tillers were collected each September and subjected to microscopic analysis for endophyte presence. After renovation, E + still accounted for 18 to 38% of tall fescue. Relative to all other species, however, E+ fescue was < 10% of pasture communities. The species mixtures sown with E- fescue had little influence on E+ fescue reinfestation (P = 0.70). Contrary to other studies, percentage of E+ fescue in E- pastures did not increase in the 3 yr of this study. Moderate grazing pressure under rotational stocking combined with relatively wet growing seasons likely favored E- fescue and suppressed E+ reinfestation. We also suggest that if pasture renovation can reduce E+ fescue percentage to < 10%, it is unlikely that E+ fescue will reinfest pastures to an extent that may cause fescue toxicosis in cattle.","Tracy, BF; Renne, IJ",AGRONOMY JOURNAL,2005,10.2134/agronj2004.0304,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.974715403958868,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,collected,"can be toxic to cattle (Bos taurus).

13530,Symptomless infection of banana and maize by endophytic fungi impairs photosynthetic efficiency,"Very little is known about the physiological interactions between plant hosts and symptomless endophytic fungi despite their widespread occurrence. We investigated the impact of two such fungi, Colletotrichum musae and Fusarium moniliforme, upon the photosynthetic capacity of two crop plants, banana and maize, respectively. Endophyte-free plants were obtained first and then infected with the fungi. Measurements of total chlorophyll content revealed very little difference between endophyte-free and infected plants of banana, whereas in maize they showed 50 % reductions in the endophyte-infected plants. The maximum photochemical capacity (F(v)/F(m)) was measured in order to determine if the plants had any photoinhibitory effect caused by biotic or abiotic factors. After 45 d of growth, endophyte-free banana plants had similar values of F(v)/F(m) to plants typical of nonstressed conditions, whereas the endophyte-infected plants showed a reduction of approx. 15 %. Unlike banana, infected maize plants displayed values of F(v)/F(m) similar to those of control and endophyte-free plants, indicating that the maximum photochemical capacity was not affected by infection. The light response curves of both species showed that the photosynthethic capacity was severely reduced in endophyte-infected plants, reaching saturation at c. 400 μmol m-2 s-1 whereas the control and endophyte-free plants were saturated at much higher photon flux densities. In banana the effect seemed to be due to an impairment of electron transport in the thylakoid membranes. By contrast, reduction of the photosynthetic capacity in maize was due to a reduction in chlorophyll content, leading to a decrease in the electron transport components and a consequent reduction in carbohydrate synthesis. It is possible that the reduction in the maximum yield of photosynthesis in both crops was caused by toxins produced by the fungi.

11692,When host-plant resistance to a pest leads to higher plant damage,"The effects of the association between grasses and fungal endophytes on orthopterans are very poorly studied although they are important grassland pests. Here, the endemic New Zealand weta, Hemiandrus sp. 'promontorius', and Festulolium loliaceum infected with EpichloA << uncinata, were used to study the effect of endophyte-mediated resistance in grasses on this large orthopteran insect in the laboratory, and the effects of this interaction on the grass. The insect was presented with F. loliaceum with and without E. uncinata infection in no-choice and paired choice experiments. Other controls were EpichloA << festucae-infected Festuca rubra and endophyte-free Lolium perenne. In no-choice experiments, persistent attempts by the insect to graze the endophyte-infected grasses (but promptly abandoning them) resulted in a significantly higher number of plants lost due to excision at their stems after the first bite (P = 0.004). The inability of affected grasses to compensate for the lost biomass resulted in a lack of significant difference between the dry biomass of endophyte-infected and endophyte-free controls (P = 0.206). However, in choice experiments, there was a preference for the endophyte-free controls when they were paired with the endophyte-infected grasses (P < 0.05). The current work shows that endophyte-infected grasses can sustain high plant losses when attacked by an orthopteran insect in the absence of an alternative food source. This contrasts other endophyte/herbivory experiments in which high herbivory occurs because chemical plant defences are at a low concentration or the endophytes have other non-toxin roles in the plant.","Nboyine, JA; Saville, D; Boyer, S; Cruickshank, RH; Wratten, SD",JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE,2017,10.1007/s10340-016-0789-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.962157132249139,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,studied,"in no-choice and paired choice experiments.

2594,Exogenous spermidine enhances Epichloe endophyte-induced tolerance to NaCl stress in wild barley (Hordeum brevisubulatum),"Background Soil salinity adversely affects plant growth. Microbial infection and exogenous polyamine application are effective approaches to ameliorate salt injury in plants. Our previous study showed that Epichloe endophytes play an important role in improving wild barley (Hordeum brevisubulatum) salinity tolerance through polyamine metabolism modification. However, the effects of polyamine (Spd) on Epichloe endophytes-induced host tolerance to salt stress are largely unknown. The aim of this work is to determine whether exogenous polyamine influences the function of Epichloe endophytes to improve salt tolerance of H. brevisubulatum plants. Methods Epichloe endophyte infected (E+) and endophyte free (E-) H. brevisubulatum plants were sprayed with distilled water or 1 mM spermidine (Spd) and treated with water or 200 mM NaCl. The experimental plots included four treatments: (a) CK, (b) NaCl, (c) Spd, and (d) Spd + NaCl. Dry weight, amino acid, sodium, potassium, calcium, nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon contents were quantified, Na+:K+ ratio and C:N:P stoichiometry were analyzed after 21 days exposure to NaCl treatment. Results There was greater accumulation of aspartic acid, threonine, glutamic acid, tyrosine, phenylalanine, histidine, arginine and proline but lower cysteine in endophyte-infected plants compared to endophyte-free counterparts in response to NaCl treatment. The presence of Epichloe endophyte also significantly increased dry weight, total amino acid, potassium, root calcium, nitrogen and phosphorus content but decreased sodium, shoot calcium content and ratios of sodium/potassium, carbon/nitrogen and carbon/phosphorus, nitrogen/phosphorus under NaCl stress. The effects of endophyte to decrease sodium content, sodium/potassium ratio and increase dry weight, total amino acid, potassium, nitrogen and shoot phosphorus were much more pronounced under dual application of NaCl and exogenous spermidine treatment compared to treatments only under NaCl treatment. Conclusion Epichloe endophytes may ameliorate the harmful effects of NaCl stress to H. brevisubulatum plants, whilst exogenous spermidine further enhanced this effect. Spermidine application to endophyte-infected seedlings decreased more of these harmful effects and mediated the function of the endophyte to suppress the negative effects of salinity stress.","Chen, TX; White, JF; Li, CJ; Nan, ZB",PLANT AND SOIL,2021,10.1007/s11104-021-05109-2,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.929831378938396,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,analyzed,"acid, tyrosine, phenylalanine, histidine, arginine and proline but lower cysteine in endophyte-infected plants compared to endophyte-free counterparts in response to NaCl treatment.

2526,Grass species and their fungal symbionts affect subsequent forage growth,"Persistence of forage grasses is enhanced through the deliberate and selective use of symbiotic fungal endophytes that confer benefits, particularly pest resistance. However, they have also been implicated in reduced plant community diversity as a result of directly or indirectly enhancing competitive ability. A relatively underexplored mechanism by which endophytes might influence pasture plant composition is by altering the biotic or abiotic soil conditions. To examine the soil conditioning effects of forage grass species and their fungal symbionts we tested the responses of three pasture plants, perennial ryegrass, prairie grass, and white clover in nine different soils that had been conditioned by monocultures of endophyte-containing (E+), or endophyte-free (E-), perennial ryegrass, tall fescue, or meadow fescue. Conditioning grass species had little effect on the responses of perennial ryegrass and prairie grass regardless of E+ or E- treatments. In contrast, conditioning species had a strong effect on the response of white clover, resulting in reduced biomass when grown in perennial ryegrass conditioned soils. The presence of endophyte also had significant growth consequences for white clover, but was either positive or negative depending on the conditioning grass species. In comparison to their respective E-treatments, E+ tall and meadow fescue conditioned soils resulted in reduced biomass of white clover, whereas E+ perennial ryegrass conditioned soils resulted in increased biomass of white clover. Among the conditioning strains (AR1, AR37, NEA2, WE) of E+ perennial ryegrass, white clover showed significantly different responses, but all responses were positive in comparison to the E- treatment. By examining the effects of several grass species and endophyte strains, we were able to determine the relative importance of grass species vs. fungal symbiont on soil conditioning. Overall, the conditioning effect of grass species was stronger than the effects associated with endophyte, particularly with regard to the response of white clover. We conclude that both grass species and their fungal endophytes can influence pasture plant community composition through plant-soil feedback.","Cripps, MG; Edwards, GR; McKenzie, SL",BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY,2013,10.1016/j.baae.2013.01.008,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.976731310233645,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,tested,"clover in nine different soils that had been conditioned by monocultures of endophyte-containing (E+), or endophyte-free (E-), perennial ryegrass, tall fescue, or meadow fescue.

Mature geldings (n=10) received diets containing either endophyte-free (E-) or endophyte-infected (E+) tall fescue seed during three experimental phases. The first phase (Days -14 to -1) was an adaptation phase, to allow all horses to adapt to a diet containing E- tall fescue seed. The second (Days 0 to 3) was the initial exposure phase to E+ tall fescue seed, used for the delivery of ergovaline and lysergic acid at 0.5 and 0.3 mg/kg of diet, respectively, to test the initial effects of exposure on routes and amounts of elimination of alkaloid. During this phase, half the geldings were exposed to an E+ diet while the rest served as controls by remaining on the E- diet. Once assigned to treatments, geldings remained on the same diet through the third phase (Days 4 to 21), which served as the extended exposure phase. Total outputs of faeces and urine were collected within each phase, to determine retention of ergovaline and lysergic acid and nutrient digestibility. Serum was collected weekly and analysed for activities of enzymes and concentrations of prolactin. Bodyweights (BW) and rectal temperatures were recorded weekly. BW, rectal temperature, enzyme activities and concentrations of prolactin in serum, and nutrient digestibility were not affected by treatment. Total intake of ergovaline by geldings on the E+ diet was 3.5 and 3.6 (SE 0.20) mg/day, and 2.1 and 2.3 (SE 0.11) mg/day were not accounted for in initial and extended phases, respectively. Lysergic acid was excreted in the urine (4.0 and 4.9 (SE 0.97) mg/day) and faeces (2.5 and 2.7 (SE 0.35) mg/day) at greater amounts than that consumed (2.0 and 1.9 (SE 0.09) mg/day) during the initial and extended exposure phases, respectively. Animals exposed to E+ seed for a period of 20 days appeared to excrete more (1.5 vs 1.2 mg/day; SE 0.08; p=0.03) ergovaline in the faeces than those exposed for only 4 days. Exposure time to the ergot alkaloids had a limited effect on the route of elimination or the amounts of ergovaline or lysergic acid excreted by horses.

4537,Regulation of a Chemical Defense against Herbivory Produced by Symbiotic Fungi in Grass Plants,"Neotyphodium uncinatum and Neotyphodium siegelii are fungal symbionts (endophytes) of meadow fescue (MF; Lolium pratense), which they protect from insects by producing loline alkaloids. High levels of lolines are produced following insect damage or mock herbivory (clipping). Although loline alkaloid levels were greatly elevated in regrowth after clipping, loline-alkaloid biosynthesis (LOL) gene expression in regrowth and basal tissues was similar to unclipped controls. The dramatic increase of lolines in regrowth reflected the much higher concentrations in young (center) versus older (outer) leaf blades, so LOL gene expression was compared in these tissues. In MF-N. siegelii, LOL gene expression was similar in younger and older leaf blades, whereas expression of N. uncinatum LOL genes and some associated biosynthesis genes was higher in younger than older leaf blades. Because lolines are derived from amino acids that are mobilized to new growth, we tested the amino acid levels in center and outer leaf blades. Younger leaf blades of aposymbiotic plants (no endophyte present) had significantly higher levels of asparagine and sometimes glutamine compared to older leaf blades. The amino acid levels were much lower in MF-N. siegelii and MF-N. uncinatum compared to aposymbiotic plants and MF with Epichloe festucae (a closely related symbiont), which lacked lolines. We conclude that loline alkaloid production in young tissue depleted these amino acid pools and was apparently regulated by availability of the amino acid substrates. As a result, lolines maximally protect young host tissues in a fashion similar to endogenous plant metabolites that conform to optimal defense theory.","Zhang, DX; Nagabhyru, P; Schardl, CL",PLANT PHYSIOLOGY,2009,10.1104/pp.109.138222,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.987284402319041,TRUE,3,1,Low,no endophyte,tested,NA,"blades.

19124,5-hydroxytryphophan mitigates ergot alkaloid-induced suppression of serotonin and feed intake in cattle.,"The impact of ergot toxicosis on livestock industries is detrimental and treatments are needed in many countries. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of acute exposure to ergot alkaloids and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) supplementation on feed intake, serotonin metabolism, and blood metabolites in cattle. Eight Holstein steers (538 ± 18 kg) fitted with ruminal cannulas were used in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin Square design experiment with a 2 × 2 factorial treatment structure. The treatments were the combination of 0 (E-) or 15 µg ergovaline/kg BW (E+) and 0 (5HTP-) or 0.5 mg of 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan/kg BW (5HTP+) administered daily for 6 d. Toxic endophyte-infected tall fescue seed was used to supply the daily dose of ergovaline. Endophyte-free seed was used to equalize seed intake between treatments. Ground seed was placed into the rumen immediately before feeding. The 5-HTP was dissolved in water and infused into the abomasum via the reticulo-omasal orifice. Blood was collected from a jugular vein catheter at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h after treatment administration. Ergovaline without 5-HTP (E+/5HTP-) decreased dry matter intake (DMI) in comparison to steers without ergovaline and 5-HTP (E-/5HTP-). However, 5-HTP infusion in association with ergovaline (E+/5HTP+) normalized the DMI. Although E + did not affect (P > 0.05) the area under the curve (AUC) of serum 5-HTP, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, tryptophan, and kynurenine, serum and plasma serotonin concentrations were decreased (P < 0.05). The infusion of 5-HTP increased (P < 0.05) the AUC of serum 5-HTP, serum and plasma serotonin, and serum 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. In conclusion, acute exposure to ergot alkaloids reduced DMI and circulating serotonin in cattle but 5-HTP administration showed potential to normalize both circulating serotonin and feed intake. Some grass species have a symbiotic relationship with an endophytic fungus that produces toxic ergot alkaloids which have detrimental impacts on herbivores. Ergot alkaloids have a significant impact on livestock production causing annual loss to the livestock industry that likely exceeds $1 billion. Effective treatment for this toxicosis is still needed. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of acute exposure to ergot alkaloids and 5-hydroxytryptophan supplementation on feed intake, serotonin metabolism, and blood metabolites in cattle.

20594,Foraging preference of barnacle geese on endophytic tall and red fescues,"Many grasses (Poaceae) have symbiotic fungal endophytes, which affect livestock by producing unpalatable or harmful secondary compounds. Less is known about the repelling effects of fungal endophytes on avian grazers despite potential wildlife management implications. Herbivorous goose (Branta spp.) species may become a nuisance in recreational use areas via fecal littering. Planting these areas with grasses that avian grazers avoid may help mitigate this damage. In 2016, we studied the foraging preference of the barnacle geese (B. leucopsis) with endophytic (E+) or endophyte-free (E-) red fescue (Festuca rubra) and/or tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix) in 2 sites in Finland that had a history of nuisance geese damage. In the high grazing pressure site, we planted both grass species, while in the low grazing pressure site only tall fescue was used.

11126,The effect of endophyte infection on persistence of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) populations in two climatically contrasting Italian locations,"Endophytic fungi may reportedly improve summer persistence in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). The objective of this study was assessing whether endophytes contributed to better persistence in 2 climatically contrasting Italian locations ( Sanluri, Mediterranean climate, 382mm average rainfall; Lodi, subcontinental climate, 802mm average rainfall). Twelve populations from Sardinia were evaluated for 4 years in each site with or without nitrogen application. The populations hosted either of 2 endophyte forms (long-conidia, Neotyphodium coenophialum; short-conidia, FaTG-2 group) and belonged to the European race of fescue (hostingN. coenophialum) or the Mediterranean race ( hosting FaTG-2). Three European-race commercial varieties ( hosting N. coenophialum) were included as controls. The evaluated material was present both in the endophyte-infected and the endophyte-free ( after chemical treatment) status. Stand persistence was recorded at the end of each year. The effect of the endophyte presence on persistence was nil in the Mediterranean site and slightly positive in the subcontinental location. Populations of the 2 geographic races had contrasting behaviour in the 2 sites irrespective of their endophyte status. The Mediterranean-race populations persisted well in the Mediterranean environment but not in the subcontinental one, and the reverse occurred for the European-race germplasm ( including the controls). The results suggest that Mediterranean conditions may be too extreme for any enhancement of persistence to be solely provided by the endophyte, and highlight the overwhelming importance of the physiological adaptation of the grass germplasm to target environment.","Pecetti, L; Romani, M; Carroni, AM; Annicchiarico, P; Piano, E",AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,2007,10.1071/AR06423,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.987412157036492,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,evaluated,were included as controls.

2000,Host-Specific and Environment-Dependent Effects of Endophyte Alternaria oxytropis on Three Locoweed Oxytropis Species in China,"Plant-endophyte symbioses are widespread in grasslands. While symbiotic interactions often provide hosts with major fitness enhancements, the role of the endophyte Alternaria oxytropis, which produces swainsonine in locoweeds (Oxytropis and Astragalus spp.), remains enigmatic. We compared endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) plants of three main Chinese locoweed species (O. kansuensis, O. glabra, and O. ochrocephala) under controlled conditions, and analyzed environmental factors at locoweed poisoning hotspots for herbivores. The results demonstrated significant species-specific effects: E+ plants of O. glabra and O. ochrocephala exhibited 26-39% reductions in biomass, net photosynthetic rate, and stomatal conductance, with elevated CO2 levels, while O. kansuensis showed no measurable impacts. Swainsonine concentrations were 16-20 times higher in E+ plants (122.6-151.7 mg/kg) than in E- plants. Geospatial analysis revealed that poisoning hotspots for herbivores consistently occurred in regions with extreme winter conditions (minimum temperatures <= -17 degrees C and precipitation <= 1 mm during the driest month), suggesting context-dependent benefits under abiotic stress. These findings suggest that the ecological role of A. oxytropis may vary depending on both host species and environmental context, highlighting a trade-off between growth costs and potential stress tolerance conferred by A. oxytropis. The study underscores the need for field validation to elucidate the adaptive mechanisms maintaining this symbiosis in harsh environments.","Zhang, YY; Li, YZ; Shi, ZJ",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2025,10.3390/jof11070516,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.97912904267979906,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,analyzed,"produces swainsonine in locoweeds (Oxytropis and Astragalus spp.), remains enigmatic.

Methods: Sixteen Coopworth lambs, mean 23.7 (SD 1.8) kg, were randomly assigned to graze three, 0.10-ha pastures of perennial ryegrass (cultivar Extreme) located in Lincoln, New Zealand, that were infected with either the AR6 novel endophyte (n=5) or wild-type endophyte (n=6) or were endophyte-free (n=5), for 18 days until 16 March 2009. Lambs on AR6 pasture were then switched to endophyte-free pasture, and those on endophyte-free were switched to AR6 pasture, for 18 days. Lambs continued grazing the wild-type ryegrass during both phases of the study. Colour Doppler ultrasonography was used to monitor cross-sectional area of lumina in the auricular and carotid arteries as measurements of vasoconstriction, and to measure pulsatility indices, heart rate, systolic and diastolic velocities, and mean velocity in the carotid artery. Urine was sampled once during each phase, to measure the concentration of urinary alkaloids. A heat challenge (32°C) was imposed on the last day of the experiment, to determine treatment effects on rectal temperature and respiration rate. Results: Vasoconstriction was detected in the auricular arteries of lambs grazing AR6 and wild-type pastures. Areas of lumina declined linearly over 9 days in lambs that were switched from endophyte-free to AR6 pastures (p>0.05), and areas increased linearly in lambs that were switched from AR6 to endophyte-free pasture (p>0.001). Resistance to blood flow in the carotid arteries decreased linearly in the 9 days after lambs were switched from AR6 to endophyte-free pasture(p>0.05), and tended to increase after lambs on endophyte-free pasture were switched to AR6 (p>0.10). The concentrations of urinary alkaloids decreased after switching lambs from AR6 to endophyte-free pasture, and increased after switching from endophyte-free to AR6 pasture (p>0.05). The concentrations of urinary alkaloids of lambs on wild-type pasture were similar between the conditioning and experimental phases. There were no treatment effects on rectal temperature and respiration rate during the heat challenge. Conclusions: These results indicated that management approaches are needed to overcome potential vulnerabilities to heat stress for sheep grazing AR6 perennial ryegrass.

1138,Do foliar endophytes affect grass litter decomposition?: A microcosm approach using Lolium multiflorum,"Symbiotic infection with fungal endophytes has been shown to decrease herbivory in several temperate grasses. We tested the hypothesis that foliar endophytes of grasses may also affect below-ground processes upon their host death, by altering the litter quality for detritivores or the microenvironment for decomposition. Microcosm-litterbag experiments were used to assess decay rates for litter produced by endophyte (Neotyphodium sp.) infected vs uninfected Lolium multiflorum plants, and to examine endophyte-mediated effects of prior site occupants on current litter decomposition. We found that litter from endophyte-infected L. multiflorum decomposed more slowly than litter from endophyte-free conspecifics and from a naturally uninfected grass, Bromus unioloides. Furthermore, the endophyte-grass association modified the decomposition environment, so that B. unioloides litter decomposed faster when placed underneath a thick layer of endophyte-free L. multiflorum litter. Litter decay rates increased with the amount of root debris remaining in situ from the previous season, but were not affected by the infection status of prior site occupants. The lower decomposability of litter from infected L. multiflorum plants persisted across a range of microenvironments, as determined by different amounts of above-ground litter and soil moisture conditions. Endophyte infection tended to reduce the N content of decaying litter; however, litter N and C/N ratio mainly accounted for interspecific differences in decomposition. Our results imply that fungal endophytes not only can affect herbivory food chains, but also soil organisms and the ecosystem processes they regulate. This study suggests a novel role for symbiotic foliar endophytes in linking above-ground and below-ground sub-systems.","Omacini, M; Chaneton, EJ; Ghersa, CM; Otero, P",OIKOS,2004,10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12915.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.972271169862137,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,tested,"decomposition.

This set of plants consisted of four Chewings fescue [Festuca rubra L. subsp. fallax (Thuill) Nyman] and two strong creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra L. subsp. rubra) genotypes inoculated with endophytes originating from Chewings fescue, strong creeping red fescue, and Poa ampla Merr. hosts. The results revealed a considerable endophyte-host interaction on plant growth in the different soils. In most cases, the effect of endophyte infection on dry weight was either positive or neutral. In a few cases, endophyte infection had a negative effect on dry weight. In sonic endophyte-host combinations, the endophyte-infected clone had significantly better growth in the high aluminum soils relative to the endophyte-free clone. These results indicate that endophyte infection alone is not enough to confer aluminum tolerance in fine fescues, but in certain plant-fungus combinations, endophyte infection can contribute to enhanced aluminum tolerance.","Zaurov, DE; Bonos, S; Murphy, JA; Richardson, M; Belanger, FC",CROP SCIENCE,2001,10.2135/cropsci2001.1981,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.913087419755689,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,evaluated,Thirteen clonal pairs of endophyte-free and endophyte-infected fine fescues were evaluated in a growth chamber study for growth in three,Thirteen clonal pairs of endophyte-free and endophyte-infected fine fescues were evaluated in a growth chamber study for growth in three sand-soil formulations differing in available aluminum.,direct_absence,investigation_methods

We tested the hypothesis that endophytes also mediate induced resistance by a grass to an herbivorous insect. Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), both infected and uninfected with the endophyte, Acremonium coenophialum, was artificially damaged by clipping a tiller from each plant four weeks after germination. We used the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) as a bioassay to determine the affects of our treatments. Fall armyworm larvae were reared by feeding them shoot and stem material of damaged and undamaged plants in a two factor (infection status and damage) design. Eight-day-old larvae weighed less and took longer to develop into adults when fed endophyte-infected endophyte-free plant material. However, the interaction between status and damage was not statistically significant. In contrast, pupae weighed more when fed infected vs. endophyte-free plant material and the interaction between infection status and damage had a marginally significant effect on pupal mass (F-1,F-177=32.2; P=0.05). Pupae reared from damaged infected plants weighed less than those reared from undamaged infected plants. No pattern with damage was apparent for insects reared on endophyte-fi-ee plants.

1507,The effects of genetic and environmental factors on disease expression (stroma formation) and plant growth in Brachypodium sylvaticum infected by Epichloe sylvatica,"Fungi in the genus Epichloe (Clavicipitaceae, Ascomycota) are endophytic and often mutualistic symbionts of many grasses in temperate areas. Species with a sexual cycle suppress host flowering and seed formation, whereas asexual fungi remain asymptomatic and transmit vertically by seed. Thus, the mode of reproduction may determine whether the symbiosis is mutualistic or parasitic. The level of sexual reproduction (disease expression) varies among different endophytes and on different grass hosts, but factors responsible for this variation, and evolutionary mechanisms leading to one or the other life strategy are not understood. As experimental system, we chose Brachypodium sylvaticum in which the endophyte E. sylvatica can express both reproduction modes. A field experiment was done in plots of a free air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) facility. Wt: investigated the effects of three environmental factors (elevated CO2 concentration, shading and fertilisation) and one genetic factor (plant and fungal genotype combination), on plant growth and disease expression. Variation in plant growth was mainly dependent on the genotype and was increased by fertilisation. Elevated CO2 and shading slightly stimulated plant growth, but only in fertilised plants. Disease expression was overwhelmingly dependent on the genotype. hence genetic: factors. Fertilisation slightly stimulated disease expression in some genotypes, while the effect of elevated CO2 was negligible, and by interaction with fertilisation inconsistent in the two years. Horizontal transmissions during the experiment, presumably mediated by ascospores, confounded the original infection status of the plants. Contagious infections occurred more frequently in the shade, and in endophyte-free host plants. The latter suggests that pre-existing infections render host plants less susceptible to superinfection by choke forming strains. Although our results clearly indicate that disease expression of E, sylvatica has a genetic basis, it is still unclear whether selection on the plants or the fungi is driving the evolution of this association.","Meijer, G; Leuchtmann, A",OIKOS,2000,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2000.910305.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.950636934125166,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,investigated,"infection status of the plants.

2262,Transcriptome of Endophyte-Positive and Endophyte-Free Tall Fescue Under Field Stresses,"Tall fescue is one of the primary sources of forage for livestock. It grows well in the marginal soils of the temperate zones. It hosts a fungal endophyte (Epichloe coenophiala), which helps the plants to tolerate abiotic and biotic stresses. The genomic and transcriptomic resources of tall fescue are very limited, due to a complex genetic background and outbreeding modes of pollination. The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in two tissues (pseudostem and leaf blade) between novel endophyte positive (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) Texoma MaxQ II tall fescue genotypes. Samples were collected at three diurnal time points: morning (7:40-9:00 am), afternoon (1:15-2:15 pm), and evening (4:45-5:45 pm) in the field environment. By exploring the transcriptional landscape via RNA-seq, for the first time, we generated 226,054 and 224,376 transcripts from E+ and E- tall fescue, respectively through de novo assembly. The upregulated transcripts were detected fewer than the downregulated ones in both tissues (S: 803 up and 878 down; L: 783 up and 846 down) under the freezing temperatures (-3.0-0.5 degrees C) in the morning. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis identified 3 out of top 10 significant GO terms only in the morning samples. Metabolic pathway and biosynthesis of secondary metabolite genes showed lowest number of DEGs under morning freezing stress and highest number in evening cold condition. The 1,085 DEGs were only expressed under morning stress condition and, more importantly, the eight candidate orthologous genes of rice identified under morning freezing temperatures, including orthologs of rice phytochrome A, phytochrome C, and ethylene receptor genes, might be the possible route underlying cold tolerance in tall fescue.","Islam, MS; Krom, N; Kwon, T; Li, GF; Saha, MC",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2022,10.3389/fpls.2022.803400,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.907507933947014,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,collected,genes (DEGs) in two tissues (pseudostem and leaf blade) between novel endophyte positive (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) Texoma MaxQ II tall fescue genotypes.

8459,Plant endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi alter the decomposition of Achnatherum sibiricum litter,"Symbiotic infection with endophytic fungi has been shown to affect the decomposition rate of host plant leaf litter, but whether this effect is influenced by the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) remains unclear. In this study, we placed litterbags with endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) Achnatherum sibiricum leaf litter in experimental microcosms in which three AMF inoculation treatments (Funneliformis mosseae, FM; Claroideoglomus etunicatum, CE; and no AMF, NM) were conducted. We then studied the dynamics of mass and nutrient losses and the soil microbial community during a 300-day decomposition period. The presence of endophytes inhibited A. sibiricum litter decomposition, while AMF significantly enhanced the rate of litter decomposition. The degree of inhibition of endophytes was dependent on the AMF species identity. The presence of endophytes significantly decreased the decomposition rate at later decomposition stages under FM inoculation, while the inhibitory effect of endophytes on litter decomposition was eliminated under CE inoculation. In the presence of endophytes, the ratio of carbon to nitrogen in litter increased, which is usually associated with lower decomposition rates. The effect of endophytes on nitrogen accumulation was also influenced by the host plant AMF status, i.e., endophytes reduced nitrogen loss from litter during decomposition only in the FM inoculation treatment. Endophytes had significant negative effects on the biomass of the soil fungal, bacterial and total microbial communities. Our findings suggest that the presence of endophytes can decrease the decomposition rate of A. sibiricum leaf litter directly by altering litter quality and indirectly by inhibiting soil microbial community development during decomposition. Moreover, this inhibitory effect changes depending on the AMF species present. These results may further our understanding of the interactive effects of these two symbionts on nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration in natural communities.","Zhou, Y; Li, X; Gao, YB; Ren, AZ",APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,2022,10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.104616,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.886532798968319,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,studied,"mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) remains unclear.

These grass endophytes have been widely studied in temperate regions. Endophyte-infected grasses are also cultivated in sub-artic conditions, but studies on the effects of endophyte infection on grasses under conditions of prolonged snow cover are scarce. A 2-year field experiment was conducted with two originally endophyte-infected meadow fescue (Schedonorus pratensis) cultivars. The growth and reproduction of endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) plants of two cultivars at two sites, differing in nutrient status and duration of snow cover, were compared at the latitude of the Arctic Circle in Finland. Endophyte infection enhanced plant performance most at the site with the higher nutrient status and the shorter duration of snow cover. The difference in growth between E+ and E- grasses increased during the second growing season and was most pronounced in the reproductive investment of grasses, but the benefits of endophyte infection for reproductive mass were cultivar-dependent. At the site with the lower nutrient status, costs of endophyte infection on the vegetative growth of grasses were found.

Removing the endophyte can reduce agronomic performance and persistence. An improved cultivar ('Jesup') with a novel (nontoxic) endophyte (trademark ""MaxQ"") has improved agronomic performance. Persistence may be related to agronomic traits and animal feeding preferences. We tested for variation in animal preference among two harvests by testing each of three hays made from Jesup tall fescue that varied in endophyte status (no endophyte, containing the novel endophyte, or containing a wild-type endophyte that produces alkaloids associated with toxicosis). We tested for preference using goats (Capra hircus), sheep (Ovis aries), and cattle (Bos taurus). All possible pairs were tested using traditional analysis of variance as well as multidimensional scaling. Multidimensional scaling of the animal preferences indicated that two dimensions were being used to rank the hays. The first dimension for all three animal species was related to variation in forage nutritive value. The second dimension was not correlated with any of the measured variables. Endophyte status was not a factor in the preferences expressed by the three animal species.

3860,Endophyte Infection and Methyl Jasmonate Treatment Increased the Resistance of Achnatherum sibiricum to Insect Herbivores Independently,"Alkaloids are usually thought to be responsible for protecting endophyte-infected (EI) grasses from their herbivores. For EI grasses that produce few alkaloids, can endophyte infection enhance their resistance to herbivores? Related studies are limited. In the Inner Mongolian steppe, Achnatherum sibiricum is highly infected by Epichloe endophytes, but produces few alkaloids. Locusts are the common insect herbivores of grasses. In this study, A. sibiricum was used as plant material. Methyl jasmonate (MJ, when applied exogenously, can induce responses similar to herbivore damage) treatment was performed. The effects of endophyte infection and MJ treatment on the resistance of A. sibiricum to Locusta migratoria were studied. We found that locusts preferred EF (endophyte-free) plants to EI plants in both choice and no-choice feeding experiments. Endophyte infection enhanced the resistance of A. sibiricum to locusts. Endophyte infection decreased soluble sugar concentrations, while it increased the total phenolic content and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) activity, which may contribute to the resistance of A. sibiricum to locusts. There was an interaction effect between MJ treatment and endophyte infection on the growth of the host. MJ treatment was a negative regulator of the plant growth-promoting effects of endophyte infection. There was no interaction effect between MJ treatment and endophyte infection on the defense characteristics of the host. In groups not exposed to locusts, MJ treatment and endophyte infection had a similar effect in decreasing the soluble sugar content, while increasing the total phenolic content and the PAL activity. In groups exposed to locusts, the effect of MJ treatment on the above characteristics disappeared, while the effect of endophyte infection became more obvious. All of these results suggest that even for endophytes producing few alkaloids, they could still increase the resistance of native grasses to insect herbivores. Furthermore, endophyte infection might mediate the defense responses of the host, independent of jasmonic acid (JA) pathways.","Qin, JH; Wu, M; Liu, H; Gao, YB; Ren, AZ",TOXINS,2019,10.3390/toxins11010007,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.864987593162903,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,studied,NA,NA,direct_absence,investigation_methods
1181,A seed-borne endophyte mediates plant drought responses and intergenerational effects on seed characteristics,"Global warming is expected to increase drought severity in diverse environments, impacting plant performance. Plants acclimate to drought by mechanisms like stomatal closure and osmotic adjustment. Maternally inherited symbiotic microorganisms with capacity to regulate these mechanisms have the potential to influence intergenerational plant drought responses. We studied how a seedborne endophyte affects maternal drought effects on seed germination water requirements and specialized metabolites. Isotopic analysis of seed cellulose indicated that drought led to improved water use efficiency (WUE; higher 613C) in endophyte-free mother plants, seemingly without affecting stomatal conductance (non-significant 618O change). Alternatively, endophyte-symbiotic plants did not exhibit a change in WUE but apparently an increase in stomatal conductance (significant 618O decrease). Regardless of the symbiosis, drought reduced seed production but not seed size. Endophyte symbiosis improved the seed concentration of mannitol and sorbitol, but this increment was higher under drought. Maternal plant responses to drought did not increase seed germination under reduced water potential but induced dormancy in seeds from endophyte-free but not endophyte-symbiotic plants. Our findings suggest that although differential accumulation of metabolites in seeds results from how endophyte-symbiotic plants perceive and respond to drought, this response may not form part of a mechanism that would enhance seed performance of progeny under drought.","Zarraga-Barco, F; Ueno, AC; Casabella, MP; Casas, C; Montenegro, MAM; Ramos, P; Schnyder, H; Gundel, PE",ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,2024,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2024.105719,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.956435817089012,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,studied,"seed cellulose indicated that drought led to improved water use efficiency (WUE; higher 613C) in endophyte-free mother plants, seemingly without affecting stomatal conductance (non-significant 618O change).

1924,Hybridization of Neotyphodium endophytes enhances competitive ability of the host grass,"Associations with microbial symbionts may lead to niche differentiation of their host. Vertically transmitted Neotyphodium endophytes of grasses often hybridize in nature. Infection by these hybrid symbionts may result in different hostplant phenotypes from those caused as a result of infection by nonhybrid symbionts. Observations of wild Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) populations show that hybrid Neotyphodium-infected (H+) grasses dominate in resource-poor environments, whereas nonhybrid endophyte-infected (NH+) grasses dominate in environments with more resources. We studied the hypothesis that hybridization of endophytes increases stress tolerance of the host. To test whether hybridization of Neotyphodium affects performance and competitive abilities of the host depending on resources, we conducted a glasshouse experiment where competition, nutrients and watering were manipulated. H+ plants had greater wet biomass than NH+ and endophyte-free plants, when grown in competition, but only in low-water and low-nutrient treatments. By contrast, NH+ plants did not perform better than H+ or endophyte-free plants regardless of the treatment combination. Our results suggest that hybridization of symbiotic Neotyphodium endophytes may increase competitive potential of the host in stressful environments and that this hybridization may be underlying niche expansion of Arizona fescue in the environments with low resources.","Saari, S; Faeth, SH",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,2012,10.1111/j.1469-8137.2012.04140.x,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.675539462142808,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,studied,"competition, nutrients and watering were manipulated.

2135,Olfactory responses of Argentine stem weevil to herbivory and endophyte-colonisation in perennial ryegrass,"Argentine stem weevil adults (ASW, Listronotus bonariensis) feed on the leaves of agricultural grasses and their larvae mine the pseudostem, causing extensive damage that can result in plant death. Plants emit volatiles that serve as signals to host-searching insects and these odours can be altered by both herbivory and fungal endophyte-infection. This study investigated whether ASW adults utilise olfaction to identify their host plants, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), and if conspecific herbivory or the presence of Epichloe festucae var. lolii fungal endophytes (strain wild-type or AR1) influenced such responses. Results from olfactometer bioassays established that ASW adults were able to utilise their olfactory response to orient towards volatiles released by perennial ryegrass and further, the weevils displayed a preference for plants previously damaged by conspecific weevils. However, there was no evidence that weevils had the ability to distinguish between endophyte-infected and endophyte-free plants using olfaction alone. Using a push-pull extraction technique, thirteen volatile compounds were identified in the blend released by perennial ryegrass. Endophyte and herbivory were found to alter these volatile compounds and quantities emitted by this forage grass. This study suggests that despite observing differences in the plant volatile blend, ASW do not perceive endophyte (wild-type and AR1) using olfaction alone and must rely on other cues, e.g. contact chemoreception or post-ingestional malaise, to detect the presence of a bioactive endophyte in an otherwise acceptable host plant.","Hennessy, LM; Popay, AJ; Glare, TR; Finch, SC; Cave, VM; Rostás, M",JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE,2022,10.1007/s10340-021-01375-2,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992197123280745,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,investigated,"However, there was no evidence that weevils had the ability to distinguish between endophyte-infected and endophyte-free plants using olfaction alone.

1973,Fungal endophytes help prevent weed invasions,"This study tested whether the endophyte-promoted competitive superiority of forage grass can be used in biological weed control. Feasibility of endophytes in weed control was tested by manipulating endophyte colonization of meadow fescue (Scherodonus pratensis ex. Lolium pretense and Festuca pratensis) in three experiments. First, species richness, the cover percentages and biomass of detected species were estimated in replicated field plots seeded with endophyte-free (E-) or endophyte colonized (E+) meadow fescue. Four years after establishment of the grass monocultures, weed species richness and coverage was higher in E- plots compared to E+ plots. The cover percentages of meadow fescue decreased with weed invasions being 75% and 98% in E- and E+ plots, respectively. Similarly, the proportion of weeds in the total biomass was over 45% higher in E- plots compared to E+ plots at the end of the six years study. Half of the plots were subjected to herbivory by voles, but the effect of endophyte overrode the effect of herbivory. Second, the survival of individually grown E+ meadow fescues was higher and the plants were 50% larger and produced 54% more inflorescences than E- plants in a common garden experiment. Third, a seed germination test demonstrated that recruitment of new meadow fescues was not mediated by substances inhibiting seed germination potentially released by E+ plants. These results demonstrated that endophyte promoted competitive superiority of grass cultivars can hinder weed invasions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Compared with the controls, most isolates of N. gansuense significantly inhibited the growth in vitro of, in decreasing order of inhibition, Bipolaris sorokiniana, Curvularia lunata, Fusarium acuminatum, and Alternaria alternata. Inhibition zones appeared between pathogens and some isolates of N. gansuense. Some isolates of N. gansuense significantly inhibited sporulation of B. sorokiniana, A. alternata, and C. lunata. However, there was no significant inhibition of F. acuminatum and a few isolates significantly increased sporulation. The leaf inoculation trial indicated that almost all fungal pathogens were able to cause lesions on detached leaves regardless of endophyte status. Both the number and size of disease lesions on E+ A. inebrians leaves caused by A. alternata, F. chlamydosporum, F. oxysporum, and F. solani were reduced compared with those on E- leaves. Only lesion numbers (not size) of Ascochyta leptospora leaf spots were significantly reduced on E+ leaves compared with E- leaves. Conversely, only the length of Ascochyta leptospora leaf spots were significantly smaller on E+ leaves than on E- leaves; numbers of lesions were not significantly affected.

1270,Potential for endophyte symbiosis to increase resistance of the native grass Poa alsodes to invasion by the non-native grass Microstegium vimineum,"Microbial symbionts can improve the competitive ability and stress tolerance of plant hosts and thus may enhance native plant resistance against invaders. We investigated whether symbiosis between a native grass, Poa alsodes, and a fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium sp.) improved the grass's ability to compete against Microstegium vimineum (Japanese stiltgrass), a common invader in the eastern USA. We challenged naturally endophyte-symbiotic and experimentally endophyte-free P. alsodes plants with the invader. In the first experiment, we manipulated symbiosis and water availability to test for context-dependency in symbiont benefits. In the second experiment, we manipulated symbiosis and M. vimineum diversity (the number of invader populations), since greater intraspecific diversity is expected to improve invasion success and might alter the efficacy of symbiosis in invasion resistance. In both experiments, presence of the endophyte reduced the per plant biomass of M. vimineum and increased P. alsodes biomass. We found no evidence that benefits of the symbiont depended on water availability, and population-level diversity had a minor influence on M. vimineum: inflorescence number showed a parabolic relationship with increasing numbers of M. vimineum populations. Overall, symbiosis in the native grass had stronger effects on invader growth than either water availability or invader genetic diversity. Our results suggest that endophyte symbioses in native plants can increase host performance against an invader, although this conclusion needs confirmation in more complex field settings where other important factors, such as herbivores and fluctuating abiotic conditions, come into play.","Craig, S; Kannadan, S; Flory, SL; Seifert, EK; Whitney, KD; Rudgers, JA",SYMBIOSIS,2011,10.1007/s13199-010-0102-2,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99462975292083,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,investigated,"(Japanese stiltgrass), a common invader in the eastern USA.

In a greenhouse experiment, we compared the performance of endophyte-infected (EI) and endophyte-free (EF) Leymus chinensis, a dominant species native to the Inner Mongolia steppe, under altered water and AM fungus availability. The results showed that endophyte infection significantly increased drought resistance of the host grass, but the beneficial effects were reduced by AM fungus inoculation. In the mycorrhizal-non-inoculated (MF) treatment, EI plants accumulated significantly more biomass, had greater proline and total phenolic concentration, and lower malondialdehyde concentration than EF plants. In the mycorrhizal-inoculation (MI) treatment, however, no significant difference occurred in either growth or physiological characters measured between EI and EF plants. AM fungus inoculation enhanced drought resistance of EF plants but had no significant effect on drought resistance of EI plants, thus AM fungus inoculation reduced the difference between EI and EF plants.

Endophyte-free plants were obtained first and infected with the bacteria. Measurements of total chlorophyll content revealed very significant differences between endophyte-free beet plants and some infected by endophytic bacteria. The maximum photochemical yield (Fv/Fm) was used to determine any photosynthetic effect on plants caused by biotic or abiotic factors. After 30 days of growth, there was significantly higher Fv/Fm for endophyte-infected than endophyte-free plants. The light response curves of beet showed that photosynthetic capacity was significantly increased in endophyte-infected plants. Photosynthesis of endophyte-free plants was saturated at 1,300 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), whereas endophyte-infected plants were not saturated at the irradiance used. The effect seemed to be due to promotion of electron transport in the thylakoid membranes. Promotion of photosynthetic capacity in sugar beet was due to increased chlorophyll content, leading to a consequent increased carbohydrate synthesis. It is possible that the increased maximum yield of photosynthesis in sugar beet was promoted by phytohormones and produced by the bacteria.","Shi, YW; Lou, K; Li, C",PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH,2010,10.1007/s11120-010-9547-7,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.738943509489344,TRUE,3,1,Low,endophyte-free,investigated,"indologene 2-2, and Acinetobacter johnsonii 3-1, on the photosynthetic capacity and growth of sugar beet.

2001,Mice find endophyte-infected seed of tall fescue unpalatable - implications for the aviation industry,"Bird strike is a significant problem for the aviation industry, caused in part by the attractiveness of the grass surrounding airports to birds. Endophyte-infected grasses such as Avanex((R)) have been shown to reduce bird populations at airports through the production of secondary metabolites. These metabolites are unpalatable to herbivorous, omnivorous and granivorous birds and are known to reduce insect densities, thereby making the sown areas less attractive to insectivorous birds. Raptors also provide a bird-strike threat which could be reduced by controlling mouse populations around airports. In this study, the effect of endophyte-infected seed on mouse feeding behaviour has been investigated. By performing a choice trial offering diets containing endophyte-infected and endophyte-free tall fescue seed, it was shown that endophyte-infected seed was less palatable to mice (P<0001 in a 14-d trial). Furthermore, when diet positions were reversed, mouse feeding behaviour was modified to again select endophyte-free material (P<0001 over a further 14d). This result shows that endophyte-infected grasses could not only be used in the control of bird populations but they also have the potential to control mouse populations which in turn would decrease the number of raptors.

Little information exists as to how fast endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum)-infected (E+) tall fescue might encroach on E- tall fescue and whether specific conditions might influence the speed of encroachment. Plots of E+ and E- tall fescue genotypes 7 and 17 were established using a modified Nelder's design to compare performance of the E+ forms of the plants in pure and mixed communities at different population densities. The plots were planted at the USDA Southern Piedmont Conservation Research Laboratory in Watkinsville, Georgia, and the University of Georgia Plant Sciences Farm in Bogart, Georgia. Plants were grown over a 5 year period and dry matter yield monitored 1, 3, and 5 years after establishment. Relative crowding coefficients were calculated for each to establish trends of encroachment of the E+ on the E- plants in the mixed communities. Generally, dry matter yields of E+ tall fescue were greater than E- tall fescue regardless of whether they were grown in pure or mixed communities. As time progressed, the difference in dry matter yield between E- and E- tall fescue grown in mixed communities was greater than that of the pure communities. Relative crowding coefficients increased as time progressed. Relative crowding coefficients at the Walkinsville location were greater after 5 years than those at the Plant Sciences Farm. Therefore, site specific conditions exist which affect the competitiveness of E- tall fescue and degree of encroachment by E+ tall fescue.

2398,Does endophyte influence resource acquisition and allocation in defoliated tall fescue as a function of microsite conditions?,"Tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh.] often benefits in terms of productivity and persistence when infected with Neotyphodium coenophialum ([Morgan-Jones and Gams], Glenn, Bacon, and Hanlin) endophyte, but the influence of novel non-ergogenic endophytes is unclear. We conducted a field experiment using container-grown tall fescue plants to determine how plants allocated resources when clipped repeatedly in microsites differing in the amount of available light associated with open (full sun), and partially shaded (about 20 or 40% of full sun) conditions. Plants of the same tall fescue cultivar (Jesup) were host to either a native or novel non-ergogenic fungal endophyte (MaxQ (TM)), or were devoid of endophyte. Seedlings of plants infected with the novel endophyte had slower germination, germinated later, and allocated more photosynthate to shoots than roots, when compared to J- or J+ plants. Herbage production of undisturbed canopies was not influenced by host-endophyte association within a microsite, with more herbage produced at the open than at the heavily shaded site. Clipping plants to a 5- or a 10-cm residue height tended to accentuate differences, with diminished productivity and greater variability occurring when plants were maintained at 5 cm. This trend was supported by allometric resource allocation patterns, and in terms of vegetative propagule mass relative to the number of propagules. Tall fescue, irrespective of host-endophyte association, grown as forage in silvopastoral situations should be managed to maintain no less than a 10-cm residual plant height. Trends in photosynthate allocation and plant size might influence persistence and should be investigated for more than two growing seasons.

14377,First report of Neofabraea kienholzii causing bull’s eye rot on pear (Pyrus communis) in the Netherlands,"Pear (Pyrus communis L.) is an important fruit crop in the Netherlands, with a total production of 349,000 tons in 2014, and ‘Conference’ is the main cultivar. In the Netherlands, pears are kept in controlled atmosphere cold storage up to 11 months after harvest. Symptoms of bull’s eye rot were observed in 2015 on ‘Conference’ pears in storage in the Netherlands. Bull’s eye lesions on apple and pear fruits are generally caused by four Neofabraea species: N. alba Jacks, N. malicorticis Guthrie, N. perennans Kienholz, and N. kienholzii Seifert, Spotts & Lévesque (Gariepy et al. 2005). N. alba is the major pathogen causing bull’s eye rot on pear fruits in the Netherlands. Independent of the species, the symptoms appear as flat or slightly sunken lesions, which are brown, often lighter brown in the center (Spotts et al. 2009). To isolate the causal agent, fruit were rinsed with sterile water, lesions were sprayed with 70% ethanol until droplet runoff, the skin was removed aseptically with a scalpel, and tissue under the lesion was isolated and placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA). PDA plates were incubated at 20°C in the dark, and single spores were transferred to fresh PDA plates. The isolates produced colonies with white-yellowish to brownish mycelium. Microconidia were produced on feathery fascicles of aerial mycelium, with a white, powdery, or sugary appearance on the surface of the agar colony. Microconidia were 2.5 to 6.5 × 1.5 to 2.5 µm, ellipsoidal, slightly asymmetrical to a curved form. The identity of a representative isolate (PPO 45010) was confirmed by means of multilocus gene sequencing. To this end, genomic DNA was extracted using the LGC Mag Plant Kit (Berlin) in combination with the Kingfisher method (Waltham, MA). Segments of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS), 28S ribosomal RNA (28S rRNA) and beta-tubulin (TUB2) loci were amplified, sequenced with primers ITS1/ITS4, LR0R/LR5, and Btub2Fd/Btub4Rd (Chen et al. 2016), and deposited in GenBank under accession nos. KX424942 (ITS), KX424941 (28S rRNA), and KX424940 (TUB2). MegaBLAST analysis revealed that the ITS, 28S rRNA, and TUB2 sequences matched with 99 to 100% identity to N. kienholzii isolates in GenBank (KR859082 and KR859083 [ITS], KR858873 and KR858874 [28S rRNA], KR859288 and KR859289 [TUB2]). Alcohol surface sterilized fruits were inoculated in pathogenicity tests in two ways: (i) with an agar disk (10 mm diameter) with actively growing mycelium of N. kienholzii prepared from a 14-day-old culture grown on PDA; and (ii) with 20 μl of a spore suspension (105 conidia ml-1) prepared from a 21-day-old PDA culture after wounding with a needle. Both experiments were performed on 10 ‘Conference’ pears. Inoculated fruits were sealed in plastic bags and were incubated in darkness at 20°C. Typical symptoms appeared between 7 and 14 days. Mock-inoculated controls with water and PDA-only controls remained symptomless. Fungi isolated from the lesions had morphological characteristics that resembled the original isolates from infected pears. The identity of these isolates was confirmed as N. kienholzii by sequencing, thus completing Koch’s postulates. Bull’s eye rot of apple and pear is an important postharvest disease, occurring in major fruit growing areas of North America, Chile, Australia, and Europe (Henriquez et al. 2004; Spotts et al. 2009). N. kienholzii was reported twice on apple in Europe (Michalecka et al. 2016). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of N. kienholzii causing bull’s eye rot of pear in Europe. © 2017, American Phytopathological Society.

17431,First Report of Fusarium solani on Utah Sweetvetch in the United States.,"Utah sweetvetch (Hedysarum boreale Nutt.) is a native American perennial nitrogen fixing legume used mainly in rangeland reclamation, soil rejuvenation, and erosion control. In June 2011, a field of Utah sweetvetch grown for seeds in central Oregon had approximately 15% of the plants exhibiting chlorosis, defoliation, stunting, wilting, and/or death. Dissection of the crown of symptomatic plants revealed discolored pinkish brown vascular tissue. Symptomatic tissues from six random plants were surface sterilized, placed on acidified potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium, and cultured for 7 days at room temperature, which allowed six fungal isolates (SS1 through SS6) to be collected. On PDA, all six isolates had rapid, creamy white colored growth. Based on observations of 1-week-old isolates, microconidia were oval to kidney shaped, single celled, 8 to 10 × 2.5 to 4 μm, and formed at the tips of long unbranched monophialides. Macroconidia were three to four septate, cylindrical to slightly curved, with characteristic foot shaped basal cell and blunt apical cell, 37 to 49 × 4.4 to 5.3 μm. Chlaymydospores observed were 8.5 to 11 × 7.6 to 9 μm. Based on fungal references (1,2,3), the isolates were identified as Fusarium solani (Mart.) Sacc. Identification of the isolates at the molecular level was determined by amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region using PCR and amplicon sequencing. Botrytis cinerea and F. graminearum cultures were used as controls for the extraction, amplification, and sequencing steps. Genomic DNA was extracted from mycelia using protocols of the MOBIO Ultraclean Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MO-BIO Laboratories Inc, Carlsbad, CA, USA). PCR was performed using ITS1/ITS4 primers and resulted in 563- to 573-bp amplicons, which were sequenced. Analysis of the ITS sequences (GenBank Accession Nos. JX524018 to JX524023) for the six fungal isolates using BLASTn revealed a 99% sequence identity with F. solani strains (AB470903, AB513851, AJ608989, EF152426, EU029589, and HM214456). Pathogenicity was confirmed on Utah sweetvetch plants in the greenhouse. Seeds of Utah sweetvetch were first plated on acidified PDA for germination; healthy seedlings were then selected and transplanted into pots with sterilized soil after 2 weeks of growth. The plants were kept in a greenhouse at Central Oregon Agricultural Research Center, Madras, Oregon. Ten 40-day-old healthy vetch plants were inoculated by drenching with a mixed conidial suspension (107 conidia/ml) of the six F. solani isolates. Ten plants drenched with sterile distilled water were included as controls. Symptoms of chlorosis and stunting similar to those in the commercial field were observed within 30 days of inoculation on 8 of 10 inoculated plants, while control plants were symptomless. Fungal isolates identical to F. solani were reisolated from the symptomatic plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. solani on Utah sweetvetch plants. References: (1) C. Booth.

17211,First Report of Phomopsis citri Associated with Dieback of Citrus lemon in India.,"Lemon (Citrus lemon (L.) Burm. f.) is an important fruit crop cultivated worldwide, and is grown practically in every state in India (3). During a survey conducted in 2013, a few small trees in a lemon orchard near Mysore city (Karnataka) (12°19.629' N, 76°31.892' E) were found affected by dieback disease. Approximately 10 to 20% of trees were affected as young shoots and branches showed progressive death from the apical region downward. Different samples were collected and diagnosed via morphological methods. The fungus was consistently isolated from the infected branches when they were surface sanitized with 1.5% NaOCl and plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Plates were incubated at 26 ± 2°C for 7 days at 12/12 h alternating light and dark period. Fungal colonies were whitish with pale brown stripes having an uneven margin and pycnidia were fully embedded in the culture plate. No sexual state was observed. Pycnidia were globose, dark, 158 to 320 μm in diameter, and scattered throughout the mycelial growth. Both alpha and beta conidia were present within pycnidia. Alpha conidia were single celled (5.3 to 8.7 × 2.28 to 3.96 μm) (n = 50), bigittulate, hyaline, with one end blunt and other truncated. Beta conidia (24.8 to 29.49 × 0.9 to 1.4 μm) (n = 50) were single celled, filiform, with one end rounded and the other acute and curved. Based on the morphological and cultural features, the fungal pathogen was identified as Phomopsis citri H.S. Fawc. Pathogenicity test was conducted on nine healthy 2-year-old lemon plants via foliar application of a conidial suspension (3 × 106); plants were covered with polythene bags for 6 days and maintained in the greenhouse. Sterile distilled water inoculated plants (in triplicate) served as controls and were symptomless. Development of dieback symptoms was observed after 25 days post inoculation and the fungal pathogen was re-isolated from the inoculated lemon trees. The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the isolated fungal genomic DNA was amplified using universal-primer pair ITS1/ITS4 and sequenced to confirm the species-level diagnosis (4). The sequence data of the 558-bp amplicon was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. KJ477016.1) and nBLAST search showed 99% homology with Diaporthe citri (teleomorph) strain 199.39 (KC343051.1). P. citri is known for its association with melanose disease of citrus in India, the United States, and abroad. P. citri also causes stem end rot of citrus, which leads to yield loss and reduction in fruit quality (1,2). Dieback disease is of serious concern for lemon growers as it affects the overall productivity level of the tree. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of P. citri causing dieback of lemon in India. References: (1) I. H. Fischer et al. Sci. Agric. (Piracicaba). 66:210, 2009. (2) S. N.

17244,Cladosporium cladosporioides Identified in China on Tobacco Seeds.,"Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) is a leafy, annual, solanaceous plant grown commercially for its leaves. China is the biggest single tobacco market and accounts for more than 40% of the global tobacco consumption (1). Tobacco seed harvested in Guiyang, Guizhou Province, China, are commonly contaminated or infected by various fungal pathogens, which can cause abnormal seedlings with dark brown lesions and stunting of roots and decayed seeds. In 2013, five samples of 500 seeds from tobacco cv. Guiyan 4 were tested for germination on moistened paper on petri dishes. On average, 35% of the seeds from all five samples developed into abnormal seedlings or were decayed and were plated onto potato dextrose agar media and grown for 5 days at 25°C in darkness to confirm the presence of a pathogen. However, one fungus was isolated from an average of 10% of the 500 seeds sampled. It was identified morphologically as Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fresen.) de Vries based on the velvety olive-brown with almost black reverse colony color and dimensions and color of conidia and conidiophores. Conidia formed in long branched chains that readily disarticulate, single celled, elliptical to limoniform, 2 to 8 (avg. 4.3) × 2 to 3 (avg. 2.1) μm. Conidia were pale to olive brown and smooth to verruculose. Ramoconidia were 0 to 1 septate, 7 to 14 (avg. 9.2) × 2 to 4 (avg. 2.6) μm, smooth or sometimes minutely verruculose. Conidiophores were pale to olive brown, macro- and micronemateus, smooth or sometimes verruculose, and of various lengths up to 320 μm long and 2 to 5 μm wide. Primer pair ITS1 and ITS4 was employed to amplify the regions of ITS1-5.8s-ITS2 of the pathogens. Sequences of all three isolates (G3, G10, and G18) (Accession Nos. KF841547, KF841554, and KF841560) were identical to each other and to four sequences in GenBank (JX230994.1, JQ768317.1, JQ768322.1, and AB763555.1). Pathogenicity of the three isolates of C. cladosporioides was verified on tobacco seedlings of 3-week-old grown on wet filter paper in the petri dishes (9 cm in diameter). For each isolate, 20 seedlings incubated in one plate were inoculated with 0.5 ml of a suspension of 105 conidia/ml. Twenty seedlings were treated with sterile water as control treatment. After inoculation, the petri dishes were incubated at 25°C, 100 to 120 μEm-2 S-1, RH > 80%, and 16 h light per day for disease development. At 96 h after inoculation, symptoms comprising medium brown to black lesions on the roots were clearly visible on inoculated plants but not on the control plants. All seedlings inoculated died 9 days after inoculation whereas control seedlings remained symptomless. Re-isolation attempts on PDA from roots demonstrated C. cladosporioides to be present in symptomatic seedlings but not in roots of the control plants. Moreover, the characteristics of the cultured fungi were exactly the same as those originally isolated. Isolates G3, G10, and G18 (KF841547, KF841554, and KF841560) were deposited with the Tobacco Diseased Fungi, Guizhou Academy of Tobacco Sciences, Guizhou, China. Previously, C. cladosporioides has also been isolated from macadamia (Macadamia integrifolia Maiden & Betche) racemes in South Africa (4), from diseased papaya (Carica papaya L.) in Taiwan province of China (2), and from seeds of Amaranthus spp. in Poland (3). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of C. cladosporioides causing seed disease on tobacco in China and the disease should be considered in existing disease management practices.

17175,First Report of Pineapple Black Rot Caused by Ceratocystis paradoxa on Ananas comosus in French Guiana.,"Ceratocystis paradoxa (Dade) C. Moreau is a polyphagous wound parasite causing black rot post-harvest disease in pineapple. This fungus is responsible for high losses of fruit destined for the fresh market and is a common problem in many countries (2). C. paradoxa is officially listed as a quarantine pathogen for French Guiana. In November 2013, the Plant Protection Service of French Guiana observed damage in crops of Ananas comosus var. perolera located in Corossony (4°19'10.8″ N, 52°10'17.1″ W) and Wayabo (5°01'02.3″ N, 52°36'18.7″ W) (eastern and middle part of the country). The three plants collected at each location showed a soft base rot of the stem and of young leaves, and developed a foul smell. Plant tissues were collected from the edge of the lesions, chopped in small pieces, and plated on malt extract agar supplemented with 100 ppm chloramphenicol. The plates were incubated at 25°C with a 12-h photoperiod. After 5 days, a fungal colony, first white and downy, then becoming black and velvety after 10 days, was transferred on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated in the same conditions. After 7 days, the colonies produced phialides releasing cylindrical or doliform conidia that were unicellular, colorless to pale brown, in long chains (3.09 to 20.17 × 3.1 to 5.57 μm, n = 20) and oval, pyriform, brown chlamydospores (8.02 to 21.32 × 4.20 to 9.76 μm, n = 20), occurring in long chains or singly with a vertical slit, usually not very visible. Furthermore, the colonies emitted a fruity odor. On the basis of these morphological characteristics, the fungus was identified as the anamorph of C. paradoxa (Thielaviopsis paradoxa (De Seynes) Höhn.) (1). The species designation was confirmed by sequencing the ITS region of the rDNA followed by comparison with reference sequences available in GenBank. Fungal material was collected from PDA culture by scraping the mycelium with a sterile needle and transferring into 2-ml microtubes. Fungal total DNA was then extracted and the ITS region was amplified by PCR using the ITS1-ITS4 primer pair. Nucleotide sequence was determined and deposited in GenBank (KJ667047). BLAST analysis showed 100% identity with C. paradoxa. The pathogenicity of the fungus was confirmed by inoculating two pineapples with mycelium from the C. paradoxa isolate grown on PDA. The peel of fruits and the base of the crowns were wounded with a sterile scalpel blade, each at five locations. Mycelial plugs (avg. 4 mm diameter) were placed on the wounds. Inoculation sites were wrapped with Parafilm to prevent dehydration and to hold the mycelial plugs in position. Negative controls received five sterile PDA plugs. The samples were incubated at 25°C in a moist chamber with a 12-h photoperiod. Eight days after inoculation, negative controls remained symptomless, whereas characteristic soft, watery, and black rot lesions developed on the base of all the crowns that were inoculated with C. paradoxa. The pathogen was successfully re-isolated from symptomatic tissues, fulfilling Koch's postulate. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. paradoxa on A. comosus in French Guiana, and quarantine measures have been enforced to prevent the spread of this pathogen that might also cause severe losses on other susceptible plant species that are important for the local market (e.g., banana, coconut, sugar cane). Pineapple has become a major crop in French Guiana, and is now subjected to a more intensive monitoring, which may explains why this disease was discovered recently. References: (1) T. R.

17134,First Report of Alternaria alternata Causing Black Leaf Spot of Rubber Tree in China.,"We first reported Alternaria heveae (E.G. Simmons ) to be the pathogen that caused black leaf spot of rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg) in Heikou county in July 2014 (1). Black leaf spots that resembled the symptoms caused by A. heveae were observed on the leaves of rubber trees of the whole propagule collection nursery in Jingping County (22°68' N and 103°05' E) of Yunnan Province. Black foliar spots (0.1 to 2 mm in diameter) surrounded by a yellow halo with lesions slightly sunken on the leaf surface were observed. To confirm whether the disease was caused by the same pathogen, 5-mm2 sections were removed from the leading edge of the lesion and were surface-sterilized in 75% ethanol, air-dried, plated on potato carrot agar (PCA), and incubated at 28°C in the dark. Colonies of the fungus on PCA had round margins and little aerial mycelia with gray-black coloration after 6 days of growth on PCA (2). Medium brown conidia were found to be in short chains of two to eight spores, ovoid, obclavate, and obpyriform, with or without a short conical or cylindrical-shaped apical beak. Conidia ranged from 22.5 to 67.5 μm long (mean 39.9 μm) × 10 to 15 μm wide (mean 12.5 μm; 100 colodia were measured), with three to six transverse septa and zero to three longitudinal or oblique septa. Morphological characteristics matched the descriptions of A. alternata [(Fries) Keissler] (4).The ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of one single-spore isolate, Ah02JP1, was amplified with primers ITS1 and ITS4. The PCR product was sequenced directly and deposited in GenBank (Accession No. KM111289). A BLAST search of the GenBank database revealed 100% similarity with A. alternata isolates KJ829535.1, KJ677246.1, and KF813070.1. Therefore, the pathogen was identified as A. alternata on the basis of its morphological characteristics and ITS sequence. Pathogenicity of a representative isolate, Ah02JP1 was confirmed using a field rubber tree inoculation method. Three rubber plants (the clone of rubber tree Yunyan77-4) were grown to the copper-colored leaf stage. Leaves were spray-inoculated (104 conidia per milliliter spore suspension) until drops were equally distributed using a manual pressure sprayer. Three rubber plants sprayed with sterile distilled water were used as controls. After inoculation, the plants were covered with plastic bags to maintain high relative humidity. The plastic bags were removed 2 days post-inoculation (dpi), and the plants were monitored daily for symptom development. Five days post-inoculation, spots similar to the original ones seen on the field trees developed on all inoculated leaves, while control leaves remained symptomless. A. alternata was re-isolated from spray-inoculated leaves, confirming Koch's postulates. A. alternata has been reported as the causal agent of leaf blight of rubber tree in India, which initially appeared as minute spots on leaves and enlarged with the growth of the leaves (3). However, in the present study, the symptoms (black leaf spots) remained small over time after inoculation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. alternata on rubber tree in China. Correct identification of pathogens is essential for disease management strategies. This report will establish a foundation for the further study of Alternaria alternata to address the disease effectively. References: (1) Z. Y. Cai et al. Plant Dis. 98:1011, 2014. (2) E. Mirkova. J.

17177,First Report of Asiatic Brown Rot Caused by Monilinia polystroma on Peach in Italy.,"Monilinia spp. are well-known pathogens causing brown rot of fruit trees in many fruit production areas worldwide. In Italy, three Monilinia species are particularly significant with regard to fruit trees, causing blossom and twig blight and brown rot in fruits: Monilinia laxa (Aderhold and Ruhland) Honey, M. fructicola (Winter) Honey, and M. fructigena (Aderhold and Ruhland). In 2009, a new species, M. polystroma, was distinguished from M. fructigena based on morphological and molecular characteristics in Europe (3). M. polystroma is not known to occur in Italy and to date has been reported from the Czech Republic (1), Hungary (3), Poland (4), Serbia (5), and Switzerland (2). In July 2013, during a survey for fungal postharvest pathogens, stored peaches (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch) belonging to different cultivars showing brown rot symptoms were observed in the Emilia Romagna and Sardinia regions of Italy. Typical decay spots were circular and brown, tending toward black, and 5% of peaches presented a large number of yellowish or buff-colored stromata and firm decayed tissues, the symptoms originated by M. polystroma. The pathogen was isolated on V8 agar (V8A) and culture plates were incubated at 25°C in darkness for 5 days. A conidial suspension was spread on malt extract agar (MEA) and single spores were selected. M. polystroma colonies grown on potato dexstrose agar (PDA) were yellowish in color. Irregular black stromatal crusts occurred on the edges of the colonies after 10 to 12 days of incubation and on the margin was present sporogenous tissue slightly elevated above the colony surface, color buff/pale luteous (1). The conidia were one-celled, ovoid or limoniform, smooth and hyaline, and 12 to 20 × 8 to 12 μm in distilled water when grown on V8A at 22°C. The ribosomal ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA obtained from mycelium using primers ITS1 and ITS4. A BLAST search in GenBank revealed the highest similarity (99%) to M. polystroma sequences (GenBank Accession No. GU067539). Pathogenicity was confirmed using surface-sterilized mature 'Red Heaven' peaches. The fruits were wounded (2 × 2 × 2 mm) twice with a sterile needle and inoculated with 2-mm plugs of 7-day-old mycelia from fungal colony margins. The sample unit was represented by 10 fruits. Control fruits were inoculated with PDA. After 7 days of incubation at 20°C in plastic containers with high humidity, typical symptoms of brown rot developed on both the wounds of all inoculated fruits, while control fruits remained symptomless. By the 14th day, all fruits had rotted and the yellowish exogenous stromata appeared on the surface of infected peaches. The fungus isolated from inoculated fruit exhibited the same morphological and molecular features of the original isolates; the molecular analysis performed using the primers by Petroczy (3) confirmed the result of the PCR with ITS1 and ITS4 primers. To our knowledge, this is the first report of M. polystroma on peach in Italy. This is relevant because the new pathogen could spread into other European countries that are main peach producers (such as Spain), causing economic losses. Bringing it to the attention of the scientific community allows the arrangement of research studies for assessing potential resistances with a significant impact on disease control management. Further studies are necessary to determine geographic distribution, prevalence, and economic importance of this organism in Italy.

17432,First Report of Fusarium Wilt of Tobacco Caused by Fusarium kyushuense in China.,"Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) is a leafy, annual, solanaceous plant grown commercially for its leaves. China accounts for more than 39.6% of total global tobacco production (3). In May 2012, seedlings of tobacco cv. Honghuadajinyuan in a Guiyang tobacco commercial field (Guizhou, China, 26.35° N, 106.42° E) developed symptoms of severe wilting, chlorosis, and stunting. The main stem and taproot exhibited reddish to light brown vascular discoloration; further progression of these symptoms eventually caused mortality of infected seedlings. To isolate the causal agent, necrotic tissues from the symptomatic root were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25°C in darkness. Colonies with white to rose mycelia and red-brown colony colors developed on PDA after 5 days of incubation. Microconidia were abundant, straight or slightly curved, clavate, 0- to 3-septate, and 7.5 to 20.0 × 2.5 to 5.0 μm. Macroconidia were straight or slightly curved, slender, 3- to 5-septate, and 25.0 to 45.0 × 3.3 to 5.0 μm. Based on the observed colony attributes, growth patterns, absence of chlamydospores, micro- and macro-spore attributes (1), and PCR amplification (using primers ITS1/4) combined with translation elongation factor primers (EF1/2) (2), the fungus was identified as F. kyushuense O'Donnell & T. Aoki. Sequence of ITS1-5.8s-ITS2 region of rDNA (GenBank Accession No. JX235957) exactly matched the sequences of F. kyushuense accession AB587020.1 (100% similarity). Analysis of the elongation factor (EF-1alpha) gene of the fungus (JX658565) resulted in a 99% match for F. kyushuense accession AB674297.1. Pathogenicity of the fungus was confirmed by performing Koch's postulate as follows. Pure cultures of the fungus F. kyushuense obtained from symptomatic tissues of tobacco seedlings were grown on PDA for 6 days. Tobacco plants to be used in pathogenicity tests were germinated and grown on potting soils in a plastic container. Additional fertilization was supplied by adding 0.2 g/L of 20-20-20 (N-P-K) in the float water. When seedlings got 6-leaf stage, they were ready for pathogenicity tests. Spores harvested from these culture plates were suspended in sterile distilled water, adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 104 conidia/ml, and inoculated by irrigating 10 ml of the conidia suspension onto roots of each of the 12 tobacco seedlings with 6-leaf stage. A group of 12 seedlings of the same age treated with sterile water served as control. Inoculated seedlings were maintained at 25°C, 100 μE m-2.s-1, relative humidity >70%, and 16 h light per day, and monitored for 9 days for symptom development. Seedlings inoculated with conidia developed disease symptoms with roots with vascular discoloration of roots whereas control seedlings remained symptomless. F. kyushuense was reisolated from the symptomatic seedlings 9 days after inoculation. F. kyushuense has also been isolated from rice seeds in China (4), and from diseased wheat in Japan (1). The common tobacco Fusarium disease reported in China was caused by F. oxysporium f. sp. nicotianae. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of F. kyushuense causing wilt on tobacco in China and the disease must be considered in existing disease management practices.

17179,First Report of Alternaria alternata Causing a Leaf Spot on Philodendron 'con-go' in China.,"Philodendron 'con-go' is widely cultivated indoors in China as an evergreen potted plant. In October 2013, a leaf spot on Philodendron 'con-go' was observed in the residential district of Luoyang (112.46° E, 34.62° N), Henan Province, China. The disease was characterized by oval-shaped, 10 to 20 × 25 to 55 mm, yellow to brown lesions with darker brown borders. Fifty potted plants were surveyed, and less than 2% of the leaves were infected. Lesions appeared mostly in old leaves. The symptomatic leaves affected on the plants' ornamental value, but had little impact on their health. Some lesions merged to form a large irregular lesion that could cover a whole leaf. Two infected leaves from one plant were selected randomly for the isolation of the pathogen. Lesions were cut into 1 cm2 pieces, soaked in 70% ethanol for 30 s, sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite for 5 min, then washed three times in sterilized distilled water. The pieces were incubated at 25°C on potato dextrose agar (PDA) for 4 to 5 days. A fungus was consistently isolated. Colonies of the fungus were deep green with white mycelium borders. Conidiophores were light brown with 2 to 4 septa. Conidia were obclavate, 14.6 to 49.1 × 8.3 to 16.4 μm, with a short beak, and with 1 to 5 transverse septa and 0 to 3 longitudinal septa, light brown to olive-brown. Based on morphology, the pathogen was identified as Alternaria alternata. Three isolates were selected randomly for further identification. To confirm pathogenicity, eight leaves of potted Philodendron 'con-go' plants were wounded with a sterile pin after wiping each leaf surface with 70% ethanol and washing each leaf with sterilized distilled water three times. The isolates were grown on PDA for 7 days and suspended in sterile distilled water to produce a final concentration of 2 × 105 spores/ml. A 5-μl drop of spore suspension was placed on each pin-wounded leaf. Each of three fungal isolates was inoculated on two leaves, and the control treatment (water inoculated) was done similarly on two leaves. The plants were placed in a growth chamber at 28°C with 80% relative humidity, 50 to 60 klx/m2 light intensity, and a 10-h photoperiod. After 7 days, lesions appeared on inoculated leaves, but the control leaves remained symptomless. Pathogenicity tests were repeated three times. Similar disease symptoms and re-isolation of A. alternata fulfilled Koch's postulates. To confirm the fungal identification, the rDNA of the internal transcribed spacer region in three isolates were amplified using primers ITS1 and ITS4 (1) and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of the ITS region was submitted to GenBank under accession KJ829535 and showed 100% sequence identity with the strain A. alternata LPSC 1187 (KF753947.1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a leaf spot of Philodendron 'con-go' by A. alternate in China. Reference: (1) T. J. White et al. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. M.

17557,First Report of Nectria haematococca Causing Stem Rot of Soybean in China.,"In October 2010, soybean (Glycine max) plants growing in commercial soybean fields in Zengcheng City, Guangdong Province developed symptoms consisting of stem and root rot, yellowing, and defoliation of leaves. Reddish, spherical fruiting bodies appeared in lesions that developed on stems. Plants with symptoms were sampled from fields. Fruiting bodies were excised from diseased tissues. Microscopic examination revealed that they were perithecia, globose to pyriform, and measured 197 to 260 μm in diameter and 226 to 358 μm long. When squeezed gently, cylindrical to clavate asci, 7.2 to 9.6 μm in diameter and 75.4 to 92.0 μm long, containing eight ascospores were exuded from the perithecia. Ascospores were ellipsoid to obovate, two celled, slightly constricted at the septum, had longitudinal striations, and measured 4.9 to 6.0 μm in diameter and 10.6 to 15.0 μm long. The fungus was isolated from the basal stem tissues of diseased soybean plants and cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium amended with streptomycin sulfate. On PDA, the culture developed into blue-pigmented colonies with whitish mycelium that produced oval to cylindrical microconidia. Microconidia had 0 to 1 septum, ranged from 2.5 to 5.2 × 7.6 to 29.4 μm, and were produced on monophialides. Macroconidia were cylindrical to falcate, thick walled, 2 to 5 septa, and 3.5 to 6.0 × 25.4 to 66.8 μm. Chlamydospores were present and ranged from 6.8 to 13.6 × 5.5 to 9.5 μm. Orange-to-reddish perithecia were readily formed in old culture. These morphological characteristics were consistent with descriptions of Nectria haematococca (anamorph Fusarium solani) (1). The rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the fragment of translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-α) genes of the fungus were amplified, respectively, with universal primers ITS1/ITS4 and ef1/ef2 primers and sequenced. BLAST searches showed that the ITS sequences of three isolates (GenBank Accession Nos. JN015069, JN190942, and JN190943) had 99% similarity with those of N. haematococca(GenBank Accession Nos.

JN874641, JN874642, and JN874643) had 100% similarity with those of F. solani (GenBank Accession Nos. DQ247265 and DQ247327). Completion of Koch's postulates confirmed the pathogenicity of the isolates in a replicated experiment. Thirty-day-old soybean seedlings of cultivar Huaxia No. 3 were inoculated by soaking their root systems in a conidial suspension (106 conidia per ml) for 30 min and then transplanted in plastic pots (20 cm in diameter) and incubated at 25 ± 2°C in a greenhouse. Control plants were treated with sterile water in the same way. There were four plants per pot and there were six replicates for each treatment. Within 3 weeks, more than 70% of the inoculated plants exhibited symptoms of leaf yellowing, stem rot, and root rots while control plants were symptomless. N. haematococca was reisolated from the diseased plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of N. haematococca causing stem rot of soybean in China and the first description of sexual reproduction of F. solani causing soybean stem rot in nature. This pathogen may pose a serious threat to soybean production in China where soybean is a main crop. Reference: (1) C. Booth. The Genus Fusarium.

17559,First Report of Brown Rot Caused by Monilinia fructicola on Stored Apple in Serbia.,"Monilinia fructicola (G. Winter) Honey is a causal agent of brown rot of stone fruits, occasionally affecting pome fruits as well. The pathogen is commonly present in North and South America, Oceania, and Asia, but listed as a quarantine organism in Europe (4). After its first discovery in France in 2001, its occurrence has been reported in Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Austria, and the Slovak Republic (1). In February 2011, during a survey for fungal postharvest pathogens in cold storage conditions, apple fruits (Malus domestica Borkh.) grown and stored in the Grocka Region, Serbia, were collected. All pathogens from symptomatic fruits were isolated on potato dextrose agar (PDA). One isolate from apple fruit cv. Golden Delicious with brown rot symptoms was identified as M. fructicola based on morphological and molecular characters. Colonies cultivated on PDA at 22°C in darkness were colorless, but later became grayish, developing mass of spores in concentric rings. Colony margins were even. Conidia were one-celled, limoniform, hyaline, measured 12.19 to 17.37 (mean 13.8) × 8.62 to 11.43 μm (mean 9.9), and were produced in branched monilioid chains (3). Morphological identification was confirmed by PCR (2) using genomic DNA extracted from the mycelium of pure culture, and an amplified product of 535 bp, specific for the species M. fructicola, was obtained. Sequence of the ribosomal (internal transcribed spacer) ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region was obtained using primers ITS1 and ITS4 and deposited in GenBank (Accession No. JN176564). Control fruits were inoculated with sterile PDA plugs. After 3 days of incubation in plastic containers with high humidity at room temperature, typical symptoms of brown rot developed on inoculated fruits, while control fruits remained symptomless. The isolate recovered from symptomatic fruits showed the same morphological and molecular features of the original isolate. To our knowledge, this is the first report of M. fructicola in Serbia. Further studies are necessary for estimation of economic importance and geographic distribution of this quarantine organism in Serbia. References: (1) R. Baker et al. European Food Safety Authority.

17611,First Report of Cladobotryum mycophilum Causing Cobweb on Cultivated King Oyster Mushroom in Spain.,"In 2010, symptoms of cobweb were observed on cultivated king oyster mushroom (Pleurotus eryngii) in Castilla-La Mancha (Spain) affecting 16% of the blocks of substrate cultivated. Cobweb appeared at the end of the crop cycle, first as small, white patches on the casing soil, subsequently spreading to the nearest king oyster mushroom by means of a fine gray-white mycelium, and eventually sporulating to produce masses of dry spores. The mycelium can quickly cover pinheads, stalks, pileus, and gills, eventually resulting in decomposition of the entire fruit body. Infected tissues of P. eryngii were plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) and the parasitic fungus was isolated. Fungal colonies consisted of abundant and cottony aerial mycelium spreading rapidly on PDA and red pigment spreading in the agar. Conidiogenous cells were 24 to 35 μm long, 3.5 to 5 μm wide basally, and tapered slightly to the tip. Conidia were cylindrical to narrowly ellipsoidal, 17 to 25 (-28) × 8 to 10 μm, and zero to three septate. Total DNA was extracted and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified for one isolate using ITS1F/ITS4 primers (1,3). The amplicon was sequenced (GenBank Accession No. JF505112). BLAST analysis showed 100% similarity of the obtained ITS sequence with two sequences of Cladobotryum mycophilum (teleomorph Hypomyces odoratus) (GenBank Accession Nos. Y17096 and Y17095) (2). Pathogenicity tests were performed using 24 blocks containing sterilized, spawned, and incubated P. eryngii substrate (3.6 kg, 352 cm2 in area). The blocks were placed in a mushroom-growing room and cased with a 40-mm layer of a casing soil (0.7 liter block-1) made with mineral soil + Sphagnum peat 4:1 (vol/vol). Five days after casing, a conidial suspension (7 × 103 conidia ml-1) of one isolate of C. mycophilum was sprayed (5 ml per block) onto the surface of the casing layer at a rate of 106 conidia m-2. Twenty-two blocks were sprayed with sterile distilled water as a control. A temperature of 17 to 18°C and 85 to 90% relative humidity were maintained throughout cropping. The first cobweb symptoms developed 23 days after inoculation and C. mycophilum was consistently reisolated from nine (37.5%) of the inoculated blocks. Noninoculated blocks remained healthy. In a second test, conidial suspensions (3.4 × 105 conidia ml-1) of one isolate of C. mycophilum were inoculated onto 20 P. eryngii fruit bodies. Ten fruit bodies were inoculated externally while the other 10 fruit bodies were cut in half and inoculated internally with 50 μl of conidial suspension per fruit body. Sterilized distilled water was used as a control. All fruit bodies were then incubated at 22°C in a moist chamber. Assays were conducted twice and the results were recorded after 7 days. C. mycophilum grew on 85% of the internally inoculated fruit bodies and on 40% of those inoculated superficially, while the control mushrooms remained symptomless. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. mycophilum causing cobweb in king oyster mushroom in Spain. This finding will have a potentially significant impact on button mushroom farms where cobweb is one of the most common diseases. References: (1) M. Gardes and T. D. Bruns. Mol. Ecol. 2:113, 1993.

17568,"First Report of a Bionectria sp. Associated with a Stem Rot of Cardon Cactus (Pachycereus pringlei) in Baja California Sur, Mexico.","Giant cardon (Pachycereus pringlei ((S.Watson) Britton & Rose) is the most common cactus in northwestern Mexico and is endemic to the Baja California Peninsula and Sonora Desert. A large part of the peninsula (El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve and Gulf of California) now consists of protected areas and is classified as a World Heritage site by UNESCO ( http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1182 ). Cardon cactus is an important ecological resource for indigenous people and is used as feed for range cattle. Since 2000, in the central and southern part of the State of Baja California Sur, an apical stem rot has spread to ~17% of the natural cardon population around San Pedro (23°29'N, 110°12'W), La Paz (24°08'N, 110°18'W), and El Comitán (24°05'N, 110°21'W). Affected cacti display necrosis of apical branches, dry rot, cracks in the stem and branches, bronzing of mature spines surrounding the affected area, and reddish brown gummy exudate. Thirty samples from the edges of symptomatic lesions were surface disinfected for 2 min in 0.8% (wt/vol) NaOCl and ethanol (70%), rinsed in sterile, distilled water, and grown on potato dextrose agar at 27°C. A cottony, brownish fungus was consistently isolated from affected tissues. Koch's postulates were performed in pots of 10 cm in diameter with 5-year-old cacti inoculated (9-day-old mycelia) and incubated (15 days) at room temperature (26°C). The rough, dry, brownish, circular lesions that appeared were the same as those observed in the field. Healthy cacti inoculated with potato dextrose agar plugs were symptomless. The fungus was always reisolated from infected cacti and morphological examinations (2) were performed: one-septate, olive-green, smooth, ellipsoidal conidium and two-celled ascospores (15 to 20 × 5 to 7 μm) were present. Also present were conidial masses from monomorphic, penicillate conidiophores in sporodochia. Cottony and white-to-light yellow PDA colonies were observed. Genomic DNA was extracted from lyophilized hyphae using the method described by O'Donnell (1) or with a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions 1 and 2 of the 5.8, 18, and 28S ribosomal RNA genes were amplified with the primer pairs ITS1 and ITS4 (3). The expected amplicon of 571 bp was sequenced and compared with fungal sequences available from the GenBank-EMBL database using the BlastN and CLUSTAL programs (MegAlign, DNASTAR, Madison, WI). The closest nucleotide similarity had 99% identity with a Bionectria sp. (GenBank Accession No. HM849058.1). To our knowledge, on the basis of morphological characteristics, DNA comparisons, and pathogenicity tests, this is the first report of a Bionectria sp. causing an apical stem rot disease in cardon cacti in Mexico. Since there are no control measures in Mexico there is a permanent risk that the disease will spread to healthy areas. References: (1) K. O'Donell et al. Mycologia 92:919, 2000. (2) H. J. Schroers.

14650,First report of Colletotrichum godetiae causing bitter rot on ‘Golden Delicious’ apples in the Netherlands,"Apple (Malus domestica) is an important fruit crop in the Netherlands, with a total production of 418,000 tons in 2011. Symptoms of apple bitter rot were observed on ‘Golden Delicious’ apples in the Netherlands in July 2013 after 9 months of storage in a packing house at controlled atmosphere. Lesions were round, 1 to 5 cm in diameter, gray and dry with acervuli, producing orange spore masses in concentric rings. Fruit were rinsed with sterile water, and lesions were sprayed with 70% ethanol until droplet runoff. The skin was removed aseptically with a scalpel, and tissue under the lesion was isolated and placed onto Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA). The PDA plates were incubated at 20°C in the dark, and single-spore isolates were propagated on PDA. The isolates were identified as Colletotrichum sp. based on culture morphology, having light gray to pale orange mycelium and, when viewed from the reverse side, ranged from pink to reddish orange. The cultures carried yellowish spore masses and dark melanized structures similar to acervuli that oozed orange conidia. Conidia were cylindrical to fusiform, pointed at one or both ends, and measured 8.0 to 17.0 μm × 3.5 to 5.0 μm. Both cultural and morphological characteristics of the pathogen were similar to those described for C. acutatum, causal agent of bitter rot of apple. A representative isolate (PPO-44377) was used for multilocus gene sequencing (Damm et al. 2012). Genomic DNA was extracted using the LGC Mag Plant Kit (Berlin, Germany) in combination with the KingFisher method (Waltham, USA) and six loci were amplified and sequenced. Primer pairs ACT-512F + ACT-783R, CHS-354R + CHS-79F, GDF1 + GDR1, CYLH3F + CYLH3R, BT2Fd + BT4R, and ITS1 and ITS4 (White et al. 1990) were used for amplification of parts of the actin (ACT), chitin synthase (CHS-1) gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), histone H3 (HIS3), beta-tubulin (TUB2) and ITS region of the rDNA gene, respectively. One sequence for each locus has been deposited in GenBank under Accession Nos. KR180290 (ACT), KR180292 (CHS-1), KR180293 (GAPDH), KR180294 (HIS3), KR180295 (TUB2), and KR180296 (ITS). MegaBLAST analysis revealed that the ITS sequences matched with 98.9 to 100% identity to Colletotrichum spp. belonging to C. acutatum species complex (including C. godetiae). The phylogenetic trees constructed using sequences of ACT, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3, and TUB2 of our strain (PPO-44377), and available sequences from GenBank confirmed the identity of this strain as C. godetiae. Koch’s postulates were performed on 15 ‘Golden Delicious’ apples. Surface-sterilized fruit were inoculated with 20 μl of a spore suspension (105 conidia/ml) prepared from a 15-day-old PDA culture after wounding with a needle. Inoculated fruits were sealed in a plastic bag and were incubated in darkness at 20°C. Symptoms appeared after 4 to 6 days on 80% of the fruits while mock-inoculated controls with water remained symptomless. Fungal colonies isolated from the lesions and cultured on PDA had morphological characteristics that resembled the original isolate from the infected apples. There are few reports of symptoms associated with C. godetiae on apple in Europe (Baroncelli et al. 2014; Ivic et al. 2013; Munda 2014). This is the first report of bitter rot caused by C. godetiae on apple fruit in the Netherlands. Currently, bitter rot is not an important disease in apples in the Netherlands. However, it is ranges worldwide and is considered one of the most important diseases, causing considerable crop losses, and may become an emerging problem in the Netherlands in the near future. © The American Phytopathological Society.",Wenneker M.; Pham K.T.K.; Lemmers M.E.C.; de Boer F.A.; van der Lans A.M.; van Leeuwen P.J.; Hollinger T.C.,Plant Disease,2016,10.1094/PDIS-05-15-0589-PDN,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.651312295035248,TRUE,2,26,Low,sterile,cultured; isolated; culture; incubated; agar; sterile; PDA; amplified; sequenced; sequencing; ITS; ITS1; observed,"and dry with acervuli, producing orange spore masses in concentric rings.

17652,Bacterial Leaf Spot Caused by the Quarantine Pathogen Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni on Cherry Laurel in Central Italy.,"In June 2010, 1-year-old potted plants of cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus L.) cv. Novita showing leaf spot symptoms were collected in a commercial nursery in the district of Pistoia (Tuscany, central Italy). Red-purple necrotic lesions (measuring a few millimeters up to 1 cm) surrounded by a brilliant light green halo were observed on the abaxial surface of symptomatic leaves. With age, the necrotic areas drop out, leaving a ""shot-hole"" appearance. Microscopic observation revealed the absence of fungal structures, whereas bacteria were isolated from symptomatic tissue on nutrient sucrose agar medium. Purified single colonies appeared mucoid, convex, and yellow on yeast extract-dextrose-CaCO3 agar (YDCA) medium, were positive to the KOH test, and induced hypersensitive responses on tobacco (cv. Virginia Bright). Three isolates were selected arbitrarily for further analysis. A fragment of approximately 500 bp of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified via PCR with the universal primer pair 27f/519r and sequenced. Subsequent database searches in the INSD (GenBank, EMBL, and DDBJ) indicated that the resulting sequences had 100% identity over 490 bp with the corresponding gene of a Xanthomonas sp. The isolates were further identified as Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni on the basis of quinate metabolism and starch hydrolysis tests and by sequencing the PCR products obtained with the gyrB (4) and X. arboricola pv. pruni-specific (3) primer sets. Pathogenicity tests were conducted on cvs. Novita and Caucasica following the detached leaf bioassay procedure (1) and by injecting with a hypodermic needle a bacterial suspension (1 × 107 CFU/ml) in the leaf mesophyll of 1-year-old potted plants (three plants per cultivar and three leaves per isolate on each plant). Incubation was carried out at 25°C under fluorescent lights with a 16-h photoperiod. After seven (detached leaves) and four (potted plants) days, all leaves inoculated with X. arboricola pv. pruni isolates showed brown necrotic spots delimited by a chlorotic margin. Reisolated bacteria on YDCA showed the same colony morphology as described above and tested positive to the X. arboricola pv. pruni-specific primer set, confirming the causal agent of the disease. Leaf tissue inoculated with sterile distilled water remained symptomless. Bacterial leaf spot on cherry laurel was reported in Lombardy (northern Italy) by the local plant protection service in 2005 but without a confirmatory diagnosis of the causal agent (2). To our knowledge, this is the first confirmed report on the occurrence of X. arboricola pv. pruni on cherry laurel in Italy. The pathogen could have a significant impact on the commercial cherry laurel production in the district of Pistoia, which is the most important area for ornamental plants nurseries (4,536 ha of cultivated surface in 2005) in Italy. X. arboricola pv. pruni is included in the EPPO A2 list of pests recommended for regulation to the member countries. References: (1) Anonymous. EPPO Bull. 36:129, 2006. (2) EPPO Reporting Service.

17446,First Report of Brown Rot Caused by Monilia polystroma on Apple in Serbia.,"Monilia polystroma van Leeuwen is a new Japanese species, similar to M. fructigena but distinguishable based on morphological and molecular characteristics (3). After its first discovery on apple in Japan, occurance of M. polystroma in Europe has been reported in Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Switzerland (2,3,4). In October 2011, during a survey for apple fungal pathogens in the Bela Crkva district, 15 apple fruit (Malus domestica Borkh.) cv. Golden Delicious were collected. Two isolates of Monilinia polystroma were obtained from apple fruit showing brown rot, covered with small yellowish sporodohia. The pathogen was identified as M. polystroma based on morphological and molecular features (1,3). Upon isolation, colonies cultivated on PDA were white to grayish and the mycelium grew 8.85 mm per day at 22 ± 1°C in 12-h light/12-h dark regime. After 6 to 8 days of incubation, black stromatal plates were observed on the reverse sides of the inoculated petri dishes. Conidia were one-celled, limoniform, hyaline, 14.7 to 21.88 μm (16.2 mean) × 7.85 to 12.92 μm (10.8 mean), and were produced in branched monilioid chains on inoculated apple fruit. Morphological identification was confirmed by PCR (1) using genomic DNA extracted from the mycelium of pure cultures, and amplified products of 425 bp in length, specific for M. polystroma were amplified as expected with primers MO368-5 and MO368-8R. For one isolate, the ribosomal ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region was obtained, using primers ITS1 and ITS4, and deposited in GenBank (Accession No JX315717). The sequence was 498 bp in length and showed 100% identity with sequences deposited for M. polystroma in NCBI GenBank (JN128835, AM937114, GU067539). Pathogenicity was confirmed by wound-inoculating five surface-sterilized, mature apple fruit with mycelium plugs (5 mm in diameter) of both isolates grown on PDA. Control fruit were inoculated with sterile PDA plugs. After 3 days of incubation in plastic containers, under high humidity (RH 90 to 95%) at 22 ± 1°C, typical symptoms of brown rot developed on inoculated fruit, while control fruit remained symptomless. Isolates recovered from symptomatic fruit showed the same morphological and molecular characteristics as original isolates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of M. polystroma in Serbia. Further studies are necessary to estimate the economic importance and geographic distribution of this organism in Serbia. References: (1) M.-J. Côté et al. Plant Dis. 88:1219, 2004. (2) M.

17545,First Report of Lasiodiplodia theobromae Causing Stem Canker of Jatropha curcas in Malaysia.,"Physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.) is an important biofuel crop worldwide. Although it has been reported to be resistant to pests and diseases (1), stem cankers have been observed on this plant at several locations in Peninsular Malaysia since early February 2008. Necrotic lesions on branches appear as scars with vascular discoloration in the tissue below the lesion. The affected area is brownish and sunken in appearance. Disease incidence of these symptomatic nonwoody plants can reach up to 80% in a plantation. Forty-eight samples of symptomatic branches collected from six locations (University Farm, Setiu, Gemenceh, Pulau Carey, Port Dickson, and Kuala Selangor) were surface sterilized in 10% bleach, rinsed twice with sterile distilled water, air dried on filter paper, and plated on water agar. After 4 days, fungal colonies on the agar were transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25°C. Twenty-seven single-spore fungal cultures obtained from all locations produced white, aerial mycelium that became dull gray after a week in culture. Pycnidia from 30-day-old pure cultures produced dark brown, oval conidia that were two celled, thin walled, and oval shape with longitudinal striations. The average size of the conidia was 23.63 × 12.72 μm with a length/width ratio of 1.86. On the basis of conidial morphology, these cultures were identified as Lasiodiplodia theobromae. To confirm the identity of the isolates, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was amplified with ITS1/ITS4 primers and sequenced. The sequences were deposited in GenBank (Accession Nos. HM466951, HM466953, HM466957, GU228527, HM466959, and GU219983). Sequences from the 27 isolates were 99 to 100% identical to two L. theobromae accessions in GenBank (Nos. HM008598 and HM999905). Hence, both morphological and molecular characteristics confirmed the isolates as L. theobromae. Pathogenicity tests were performed in the glasshouse with 2-month-old J. curcas seedlings. Each plant was wound inoculated by removing the bark on a branch to a depth of 2 mm with a 10-mm cork borer. Inoculation was conducted by inserting a 10-mm-diameter PDA plug of mycelium into the wound and wrapping the inoculation site with wetted, cotton wool and Parafilm. Control plants were treated with plugs of sterile PDA. Each isolate had four replicates and two controls. After 6 days of incubation, all inoculated plants produced sunken, necrotic lesions with vascular discoloration. Leaves were wilted and yellow above the point of inoculation on branches. The control plants remained symptomless. The pathogen was successfully reisolated from lesions on inoculated branches. L. theobromae has been reported to cause cankers and dieback in a wide range of hosts and is common in tropical and subtropical regions of the world (2,3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of stem canker associated with L. theobromae on J. curcas in Malaysia. References: (1) S. Chitra and S. K. Dhyani. Curr. Sci. 91:162, 2006. (2) S.

17398,First Report of Brown Rot Caused by Monilinia fructicola on Apple in Italy.,"Monilinia fructicola (G. Wint.) Honey, the causal agent of brown rot, is one of the most important fungal pathogens of stone fruit but may also affect pome fruits. The pathogen is common in North America, Oceania, South America, and Asia. It is a quarantined pathogen in Europe (3), but was recently detected in apple from the Czech Republic, Germany, and Serbia (1,2,4). In January 2012, during a survey for fungal postharvest pathogens, stored apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) belonging to the cultivars Gala and Pink Lady showing brown rot symptoms were observed in the Emilia Romagna region, Italy. Typical decay spots were circular and brown, tending toward black. Decayed tissues remained firm, and numerous grayish pustules containing spores appeared on rotted areas. The pathogen was isolated on V8 juice agar and culture plates were incubated at 25°C in darkness for 5 days. A conidial suspension was spread on malt extract agar and single spores were selected. The colonies were morphologically identified as M. fructigena. Two colonies developing a gray mass of spores in concentric rings with the reverse side black were further studied by molecular tools. The colony margins were even and the conidia were one-celled, limoniform, hyaline, and 12.1 to 17.4 × 8.4 to 11.2 μm. The ribosomal ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA obtained from mycelium using primers ITS1 and ITS4. A BLAST search in GenBank revealed the highest similarity (99%) to M. fructicola sequences (GenBank Accession Nos. HQ893748.1 and FJ515894.1). Pathogenicity was confirmed using surface-sterilized mature 'Gala' apples, wounded with a sterile needle, and inoculated with an isolate conidial suspension (103 spores/ml). A 20 μl droplet was placed in the wound; control fruits received sterile water without conidia. After 5 days of incubation at 20°C in plastic containers with high humidity, typical symptoms of brown rot developed on inoculated fruits, while control fruits remained symptomless. The fungus isolated from inoculated fruit exhibited the same morphological and molecular features shown by the original isolates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the fungus M. fructicola on apple in Italy. Further studies are necessary to determine geographic distribution, prevalence and economic importance of this quarantine organism in Italy. References: (1) J. Duchoslavovà et al.

17284,First Report of Fusarium avenaceum Causing Postharvest Decay of 'Gala' Apple Fruit in the United States.,"Apples are kept in controlled atmosphere cold storage for 9 to 12 months and are highly susceptible to postharvest decay caused by various fungi. Fusarium avenaceum is a wound pathogen that has been shown to account for the majority of Fusarium rot on apple fruit in Croatia (1). F. avenaceum produces an array of mycotoxins including moniliformin, acuminatopyrone, and chrysogine, which are of primary concern for the apple processing industry (2). In February 2013, 'Gala' apple fruits with soft, circular, brown, watery lesions with characteristic abundant whitish mycelium covering the surface of the colonized fruit were obtained from bins from a commercial storage facility located in Pennsylvania. Several samples were collected and prepared for pathogen isolation. Apples were rinsed with sterile water, and the lesions were sprayed with 70% ethanol until runoff. The apple skin was aseptically removed with a scalpel, and asymptomatic tissue was placed onto full strength potato dextrose agar (PDA) petri plates without antibiotics and incubated at 25°C under natural light. Two single-spore isolates were propagated on PDA and permanent cultures were maintained as slants and stored in a cold room at 4°C in the dark. Fungal colonies initially formed abundant fluffy white mycelium and produced a golden orange pigment on PDA at 25°C. Isolates were identified as Fusarium based on cultural and conidial morphology as macroconidia were slightly falcate, thin-walled, usually 3 to 5 septate, with a tapering apical cell that was on average 23.6 μm long × 5.0 μm wide (n = 50). Microconidia were produced on PDA plates while chlamydospores were not evident. Identity of the isolates was confirmed through DNA extraction followed by amplification and sequencing of the translation elongation factor (EF-1α, 350 bp) gene region. The amplicons were sequenced using the forward and reverse primers and assembled into a consensus representing 2X coverage. MegaBLAST analysis revealed that both isolates were 100% identical with many other culture collection F. avenaceum sequences in Genbank (Accessions JQ949291.1, JQ949305.1, and JQ949283.1), which confirms their identification in conjunction with the morphological observations. Koch's postulates were conducted to determine pathogenicity using organic 'Gala' apple fruit that were surface sanitized with soap and water, sprayed with 70% ethanol, and wiped dry. The fruit were wounded with a finishing nail to 3 mm depth, inoculated with 50 μl of a conidial suspension (1 × 104 conidia/ml) using a hemocytometer, and stored at 25°C in 80-count boxes on paper trays for 21 days. Water-only controls were symptomless. Ten fruit composed a replicate for each isolate, and the experiment was repeated. Symptoms observed on artificially inoculated 'Gala' apple fruit were identical to the decay observed on 'Gala' apples that were obtained from cold storage. Decay caused by F. avenaceum may represent an emerging problem for the apple storage and processing industry. Therefore, it is important to monitor for this pathogen to prevent future losses and mycotoxin contamination of processed fruit products caused by this fungus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Fusarium rot caused by F. avenaceum on apple fruit from cold storage in the United States. References: (1) Z. Sever et al. Arch. Ind.

17333,First Report of Botryosphaeria dothidea Causing White Rot of Apple Fruit in Serbia.,"Botryosphaeria dothidea (Moug.: Fr.) Ces. & De Not has a worldwide distribution infecting species from over 80 genera of plants (1). Apart from being an important pathogen of apple trees in many countries, B. dothidea can cause pre- and postharvest decay on apple fruit (2). It has been known to cause canker and dieback of forest trees in Serbia (3), but has not been recorded either on apple trees or apple fruit. In December 2010, apple fruit cv. Idared (Malus × domestica Borkh.) with symptoms of white rot were collected from one storage in the area of Svilajnac in Serbia. The incidence of the disease was low but the symptoms were severe. Affected fruit were brown, soft, and almost completely decayed, while the internal decayed tissue appeared watery and brown. A fungus was isolated from symptomatic tissue of one fruit after surface sterilization with 70% ethanol (without rinsing) and aseptic removal of the skin. Small fragments of decayed tissue were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated in a chamber at 22°C under alternating light and dark conditions (12/12 h). Fungal colonies were initially whitish, but started turning dark gray to black after 5 to 6 days. Pycnidia were produced after 20 to 25 days of incubation at 22°C and contained one-celled, elliptical, hyaline conidia. Conidia were 17.19 to 23.74 μm (mean 18.93) × 3.72 to 4.93 μm (mean 4.45) (n = 50). These morphological characteristics are in accordance with those described for the fungus B. dothidea (4). Genomic DNA was isolated from the fungus and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified with the primers ITS1/ITS4 and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence has been assigned to GenBank Accession No. KC994640. BLAST analysis of the 528-bp segment showed a 100% similarity with several sequences of B. dothidea deposited in NCBI GenBank, which confirmed morphological identification. Pathogenicity was tested by wound inoculation of five surface-sterilized, mature apple fruit cv. Idared with mycelium plugs (5 mm in diameter) of the isolate grown on PDA. Five control fruit were inoculated with sterile PDA plugs. After 5 days of incubation in plastic containers, under high humidity (RH 90 to 95%) at 22°C, typical symptoms of white rot developed on inoculated fruit, while wounded, uninoculated, control fruit remained symptomless. The isolate recovered from symptomatic fruit showed the same morphological features as original isolate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of B. dothidea on apple fruit in Serbia. Apple is widely grown in Serbia and it is important to further investigate the presence of this pathogen in apple storage, as well as in orchards since B. dothidea may cause rapid disease outbreaks that result in severe losses.

17503,First Report of Target Spot of Broadleaf Tobacco Caused by Rhizoctonia solani (AG-3) in Connecticut.,"In June 2011, 15 transplant beds of broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L., cv. C9) plants in Hartford County, Connecticut, were observed with almost every plant diseased. Leaf lesion symptoms ranged from small (2 to 3 mm) water-soaked spots to larger (2 to 3 cm) lesions. Disease was subsequently observed, also at nearly 100% incidence in a 10-hectare field on that farm and at additional broadleaf tobacco farms from two other towns in Hartford County and one town in Tolland County. Lesions exhibited a pattern of concentric rings, necrotic centers and tears in the centers, and margins that often resulted in a shot-hole appearance. Some lesions had chlorotic halos. Rhizoctonia solani Kuhn (Thanatephorus cucumeris A. B. Frank) was isolated from the margins of lesions that had been surface sterilized in 0.5% NaOCl for 30 s and then rinsed in sterile distilled water and placed on the surface of half-strength potato dextrose agar (PDA). Multiple isolations were made and the pathogen was identified on the basis of mycelial characteristics including multinucleate cells, septate hyphae wider than 7 μm, and hyphal branches occurring at approximately right angles, constricted at the base (4). Eight-week-old potted tobacco plants were each inoculated by spraying with a mycelial suspension (1 × 105 CFU) of an isolate of R. solani recovered from tobacco onto leaves, or with water alone (five plants each). The plants were placed in plastic bags in a 24°C growth chamber and misted. After 2 days, the bags were removed and the potted plants placed in trays filled to a depth of 1 cm with water in the growth chamber. After 8 days, the pathogen was reisolated from all inoculated plants exhibiting water-soaked spots as disease symptoms. Leaves inoculated with water or half-strength PDA plugs alone were asymptomatic. DNA was liberated from hyphae of the R. solani isolate by bead beating in STE buffer using 0.15 mm zirconium beads. Two microliters of the eluate was used to amplify the ITS region. Amplified DNA was purified in a Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification kit and submitted to the Yale science hill genomic facility for standard Sanger dideoxy sequencing. The sequence was exactly the same as an isolate from Massachusetts that we sequenced in 2010 (GenBank Accession No. HQ241274). The ITS sequence confirmed our identification of this new isolate as R. solani anastomosis group (AG) 3. This disease has been previously reported on tobacco from South America, South Africa, and the southern United States (1), Canada (3), and Massachusetts (2). Conditions were very conducive for disease because 2011 was a very wet year in Connecticut. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this disease in broadleaf cigar wrapper tobacco in Connecticut. The sequence data suggested that it may have been introduced to Connecticut from Massachusetts. We have found the target spot pathogen distributed across the tobacco producing area of Connecticut. This constitutes a serious threat as there are no systemic fungicides currently registered for control of this disease in broadleaf tobacco. References: (1) J. S. Johnk et al.

17537,First Report of Leaf Spot on Gerbera jamesonii Caused by Corynespora cassiicola in China.,"Gerbera (Gerbera jamesonii Bolus ex. Hook f.) is a popular cut flower and flowering potted plant. In August 2011, a new leaf spot disease was observed on double-type Gerbera growing in outdoor ground beds in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China. Approximately 30% of about 20,000 Gerbera plants in the Guangzhou ground beds were affected. Leaf spots were round or irregular with grayish centers surrounded by dark brown borders and ranged from 5 to 15 mm in diameter. Leaves with multiple lesions became blighted. A fungus was isolated from the lesions and single-spore isolates plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) produced gray, floccose colonies, which reached 65 mm on PDA after 7 days at 28°C. Conidiophores were brown or olivaceous, cylindrical, straight and unbranched, two to seven septations, and 25 to 83 × 4 to 7 μm. Conidiogenous cells were olivaceous or brown, cylindrical, and 11 to 21 × 4 to 6 μm. Conidia were borne singly or in chains of two to five, brown, cylindrical, straight to slightly curved, two to eight pseudosepta, and 30 to 90 × 5.5 to 11.5 μm (mean 70.4 × 7.3 μm), with a conspicuous hilum. These characteristics were consistent with the description of Corynespora cassiicola (Berk. & M.A. Curtis.) C.T. Wei (1). The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of one isolate (GenBank Accession No. JN853778) was amplified using primers ITS4 and ITS5 (3) and sequenced. A BLAST search in GenBank revealed highest similarity (99%) to sequences of C. cassiicola (AY238606.1 and FJ852715.1). Pathogenicity tests were conducted on 10 potted double-type Gerbera plants. Five wounded and five unwounded leaves on each plant were inoculated with 5-mm mycelial plugs from the periphery of 5-day-old cultures of the isolated fungus. The plugs were put on the leaf surface and secured with sterile wet cotton. Sterile PDA plugs were used as the control treatment on different leaves of the same plants that were inoculated. Plants were covered with plastic bags and incubated in a growth chamber with 12 h of light at 28°C. Necrotic lesions appeared on wounded leaves after 2 to 3 days of incubation and on unwounded leaves 5 to 7 days after incubation. Symptoms on wounded and unwounded leaves were similar to those observed in the field, whereas control leaves inoculated with sterile PDA plugs remained symptomless. C. cassiicola was consistently reisolated from these lesions. Although there are approximately 644 reported hosts of C. cassiicola (2), to our knowledge, this is the first report of C. cassiicola leaf spot on G. jamesonii. Because the disease caused damage to the foliage and affected the flowering of the plants, control measures may need to be implemented for the production of Gerbera in cut flower nurseries.

17282,First Report of Gray Mold on Amorphophallus muelleri Caused by Botrytis cinerea in China.,"Amorphophallus muelleri is a perennial tuberous plant in the family Araceae. The name konjac is commonly used for the species of genus Amorphophallus that produce a polysaccharide, glucomannan. The latter, called konjac glucomannan, is extracted from the tubers of these species. Glucomannan is an excellent gelling agent used in food, pharmaceutical and chemical industry, a specialty crop grown as a source of glucomannan for industrial use. It is an important cash crop and thus contributes to poverty alleviation in southwest China. Its planting area is about 150 million mu (10 million ha). In July 2012, symptoms of an unknown blight were observed on 5 to 10% of A. muelleri flowers and seeds being grown for commercial seed production. Greenhouses temperatures ranged from 20 to 34°C (avg. 26°C). A light grey mycelium was observed on symptomatic tissues, especially flowers. Severely infected flowers and stems eventually rotted, then dried out. Diseased tissue was excised from affected flowers and surfaces and disinfected with 1% sodium hypochlorite, followed by 70% alcohol. The tissue was then rinsed in sterile distilled water, plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at 26°C. Mycelial growth on PDA was initially whitish and turned gray with age. Dark appearing conidiophores bore botryose heads of hyaline, ellipsoid, unicellular conidia, grey in mass, measuring 7.2 (6.2 to 9.5) × 5.3 (4.5 to 6.0) μm. Black, irregular sclerotia formed at random in the culture. These morphological features were typical of those described for Botrytis cinerea (2). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified using primers ITS4/ITS6 and sequenced (1). BLAST analysis of a 557-bp segment had a 99% similarity with the sequence of Botryotinia fuckeliana (anamorph = B. cinerea). The representative nucleotide sequence has been assigned the GenBank Accession No. KC999986. On the basis of morphological and molecular results, the fungus isolated from diseased konjac flowers and flower tissue was confirmed to be B. cinerea. Pathogenicity tests: Inoculum was prepared from 7-day-old cultures on PDA. Six flowering A. muelleri in 1-liter pots were spray inoculated with a 1.0 × 106 conidia/ml suspension from 7-day-old PDA cultures. As a control, six healthy plants were sprayed with sterile distilled water. Each plant was covered with a transparent polyethylene bag for 3 days and maintained in a greenhouse at temperatures between 20 and 26°C. After 8 days, small, round to irregular brown spots developed on both flowers and stems, which finally blighted. Water-treated plants remained symptomless. Koch's postulates were fulfilled when the pathogen was re-isolated from the diseased organs. Blight on common calla lily (calla lily and Amorphophallus are in the same family, different genera) flower attributed to B. cinerea was previously reported in Argentina (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of B. cinerea on A. muelleri in China. References: (1) D. E. L. Cooke and J. M. Duncan. Mycol. Res. 101:667, 1997. (2) M. B. Ellis.

18685,First Report of Albugo ipomoeae-panduratae Causing White Rust on Ivyleaf morningglory (Ipomoea hederacea) in Iowa.,"Ivyleaf morningglory (Ipomoea hederacea L.) is a prevalent weed in Iowa. This weed was found in corn field with approx. >50% incidence and from 10-40% severity of white pustules in Boone County during summer 2022, 2023, and 2024. The weed was observed with irregularly yellow-necrotic spots on the adaxial surface of leaves with white pustules on the abaxial side. Initially, the adaxial surface of the infected leaf exhibited yellow irregular spots that gradually turned brown and necrotic (Fig. S1A). On the yellow irregular spots of the abaxial surface, tiny, powdery, and chalky-white-cream sori appeared (Fig. S1B). Sori were observed individually or in clusters in somewhat as in concentric rings (Fig. S1C-D). Fresh, symptomatic leaves were collected for microscopic and molecular identification. If sori remained unopened, a sterile syringe was used to scrape sporangia onto a glass slide with blue lactophenol to inspect under a light microscope. Sporangia were hyaline, cylindrical-rectangular, 15.8 to 20.9 µm long (mean 17.9 µm, SE 0.46 µm), and 12.8 to 17.6 µm wide (mean 15.6 µm, SE 0.6 µm; Fig. S1E) (n = 20). Microscopic observations indicated that the causal agent was Albugo sp. Voucher specimens (accession nos. 458429 & 458430) were deposited in the Ada Hayden herbarium from Iowa State University. High amounts of sporangia were collected using a sterile elongated flock swab 6 in HydraFlock (Puritan Medical Products, Guilford, ME) for DNA extraction and pathogenicity test. Fungal genomic DNA was isolated separately from sporangia sori by Qiagen DNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For molecular identification, two samples from different plants were processed (ALBUG_03 and ALBUG_04). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS1-O/LR0 primers) region and cox-2 (cox2-F/cox2-RC4 primers) gene were amplified by PCR (Kim et al. 2019; Choi et al. 2015). In both cases, amplicons (600 bp ITS region; 840 bp cox-2 region) were purified by PCR cleanup ExoSAP-IT express (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) and further subjected to Sanger sequencing. Both sequences showed similarity to A. ipomoeae-panduratae in ITS (99.87% with reference strain DQ643920) and cox-2 (100% with reference strain AY913804) region. A phylogenetic tree was built with sequences of these two genes of Albugo species and related genera (Fig. S2). Both isolates-sequences were molecularly identical, then the isolate ALBUG_03 strain from this study, was uploaded as representative in GenBank as Albugo ipomoeae-panduratae (PQ452335 and PQ489431). For the pathogenicity test, ivyleaf morningglory seeds were surface disinfested with ethanol 70% for 30 s and NaOCl (0.8%) for 1 min, rinsed twice in sterile water and sown into autoclaved compost:perlite mix (50:50). Zoospores were produced from a sporangiospores- suspension of sterile water (105/ml) as described by Pidskalny & Rimmer (1985) with slight modifications. Suspension was shocked at 4°C for an hour and placed in the dark at 25°C. After 24 h, the zoospores were inoculated on 14 days old-healthy plants by spraying the suspension with 0.1% Tween 20. After the inoculation, plants were kept inside a plastic bag for 3 days and then removed. Plants were placed in a growth chamber at 25°C and 70% RH. Symptoms resembling the original white rust disease appeared at 10 DAI, and sporangia were seen under microscope; controls remained symptomless (Fig. S1F). White rust has been reported previously in Iowa and nearby states; however, to our knowledge, this is the first report of Albugo ipomoeae-panduratae being identified as the causal pathogen for white rust on ivyleaf morningglory in Iowa. It is important to document the actual identity of this oomycete, as this pathogen has a broad host range within Ipomoea and Convolvulus genera plants, including important food crops such as sweet potato (I. batatas).",Nieto-López EH; Dangal NK; Wiggs SN; Gabriel-Peralta S; Mueller DS,Plant disease,2025,10.1094/PDIS-12-24-2570-PDN,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.6107779334169,TRUE,2,24,Low,sterile,isolated; sterile; pcr; amplified; primers; sequencing; sanger; ITS; ITS1; observed; lactophenol; collected; processed,"Fresh, symptomatic leaves were collected for microscopic and molecular identification.

17132,First Report of Alternaria alternata Causing Leaf Spot on Bruguiera gymnorrhiza in China.,"Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Savigny is an important mangrove tree species that grows in the intertidal regions of the tropical and subtropical coastlines. In a survey conducted in March 2014, a leaf spot disease on this plant was observed in Sea View Promenade in Zhanjiang, Guangdong Province, China. Symptoms on leaves initially appeared as small circular to irregular, dark brown, necrotic, sunken spots with an average diameter of 4 to 7 mm. The spots gradually enlarged in size, becoming irregular, or remained circular with concentric rings or zones. In the latter, the spots coalesced, and the leaves withered, dried, and fell from the plants. Leaf tissues (3 × 5 mm), cut from the margins of lesions, were surface-disinfected, placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at 28°C with a 12-h photoperiod. Five fungi (MLL1 to MLL5) with different morphological characteristics were obtained. To fulfill Koch's postulates, wounded and nonwounded leaves were inoculated. Fresh wounds were made with a sterile needle on 10 detached leaves and 10 leaves on five living plants for fungi MLL1 to MLL5 independently. Mycelial plugs of each fungus were applied to wounded and nonwounded leaves. For the control, 10 leaves on five living plants were inoculated with agar plugs in a similar manner, to both wounded and nonwounded leaves. All treatments were incubated in a humid chamber in the dark at 28°C. Leaf spots identical to those observed in the field were observed on the wounded leaves inoculated with fungus MLL3 after 3 to 4 days, while the other four fungi and the control remained symptomless. The 10 nonwounded leaves inoculated with fungus MLL3 were also infected after 5 days. The fungus, with the same colony and conidial morphology as MLL3, was re-isolated from the affected leaves. The pathogenic test was repeated three times under the same conditions. Hyphal tips of MLL3 were transferred to PDA for morphological observation. Colonies of white-to-dark-gray mycelia, black on the underside, formed on PDA. The colonies were further identified as Alternaria sp., based on the dark brown, obclavate to obpyriform catenulate conidia with longitudinal and transverse septa tapering to a prominent beak attached in chains on a simple and short conidiophore (3). Conidia varied from 22.5 × 40.26 to 3.95 × 5.79 μm and had three to eight transverse and zero to four longitudinal septa, with a beak length of 0 to 7.25 μm. For molecular identification, PCR was carried out using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region primers ITS1/ITS4, partial sequences of the beta tubulin gene primers Bt1a-Bt1b (1), and A. alternata species-specific primers AAF2/AAR3 (2). The PCR products were subjected to direct sequencing. The resulting sequences were compared against the GenBank nucleotide database by using a BLAST alignment, which revealed that MLL3 had 99 to 100% identity with A. alternata for the ITS, Bt1a-Bt1b, and AAF2/AAR3 regions (GenBank Accession Nos. KF669893, GQ240308, and KJ716876, respectively). Sequences for MLL3 were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KJ767515, KJ921779, and KJ921778. According to both morphological and sequence analyses, the pathogen of the leaf spot of B. gymnorrhiza was identified as A. alternata. To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. alternata on leaves of B. gymnorrhiza in China. This pathogen could cause serious foliar damage and threaten the survival, growth, and fitness of the local B. gymnorrhiza community. References: (1) N. L. Glass and G. C. Donaldson. Appl. Environ.

14518,First report of Fusarium avenaceum causing postharvest decay on ‘conference’ pears in the Netherlands,"Pear (Pyrus communis) is an important fruit crop in the Netherlands, with a total production of 349,000 tons in 2014. ‘Conference’ is the main pear cultivar that occupies 75% of the total pear production area in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, pears are kept in controlled atmosphere cold storage for 9 to 11 months after harvest. Lesions were observed on pears of the cultivar Conference in a survey carried out from 2012 to 2014 in packing houses in the Netherlands. In general, low incidences of 1 to 5% were recorded. Lesions showed brown and watery circular necrosis, were slightly sunken, often with visible whitish, yellowish, or pink mycelia covering the lesions. Fruits were rinsed with sterile water, and lesions were sprayed with 70% ethanol until droplet runoff. The skin was removed aseptically with a scalpel, and tissue under the lesion was isolated and placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA). The PDA plates were incubated at 20°C in the dark, and single spore isolates were propagated on fresh PDA plates. These isolates produced fast-growing colonies with extensive aerial mycelium which was initially white, then turning yellow to pink and a dark pink to red reverse. Macroconidia were slightly falcate, thin-walled, usually 5 septate, with a tapering apical cell, and measured 40 to 80 × 3.5 to 5 μm. Both cultural and morphological characteristics of the pathogen were similar to those described for Fusarium spp. The identity of two representative isolates (Fu5-44261 and Fu6-44280) from different pear lots was confirmed by means of multilocus gene sequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted using the LGC Mag Plant Kit (Berlin) in combination with the Kingfisher method (Waltham, MA). Sequences of ITS region, translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1), and histone H3 (HIS3) loci were amplified and sequenced. The sequences have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KT350588 and 89 (ITS), KT350605 and 06 (TEF1), and KT935569 and 70 (HIS3). MegaBLAST analysis revealed that our ITS sequences matched with 99.8 to 100% identity to Fusarium spp. belonging to the Fusarium tricinctum species complex. The TEF1 sequences of both isolates were 99 to 100% identical with F. avenaceum culture collection sequences in GenBank (JQ429374 and GQ915502). The HIS3 sequences of both isolates were 97 to 99% identical with the sequences of accessions JQ435857 and GQ915469, confirming the identity of these isolates as F. avenaceum. Koch’s postulates were performed on 15 ‘Conference’ pears per isolate. Surface sterilized fruit were inoculated with 20 μl of a suspension of 105 macroconidia ml-1 prepared from a 15-day-old PDA culture, after wounding with a needle. Inoculated fruits were sealed in a plastic bag and incubated in darkness at 20°C. Symptoms appeared after 4 to 6 days on 100% of the fruits while mock-inoculated controls with water remained symptomless. Fungal colonies isolated from the lesions and cultured on PDA morphologically resembled the original isolate from the infected pears. Symptoms observed on artificially inoculated ‘Conference’ pear fruit were identical to the decay observed on ‘Conference’ pears that were obtained from cold storage. Only few reports describe symptoms associated with F. avenaceum on apple in Europe and the United States (Kou et al. 2014; Sever et al. 2012; Sørensen et al. 2009), while F. avenaceum infections of pears have not been reported. Thus, this is the first report of storage decay caused by F. avenaceum on pear. F. avenaceum infections may constitute a safety issue due to the potential production of mycotoxins such as moniliformin (Sørensen et al. 2009). © 2016, American Phytopathological Society.

17375,First Report of Lily Blight and Wilt Caused by Fusarium tricinctum in China.,"Lily (Lilium spp.) is one of the most well-known horticultural crops, and plays an important economic role in China. In September 2011, wilted plants were observed on Lilium oriental hybrid cultivar 'Sorbonne' growing in Longde County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, China. Disease symptoms included wilting, stem and root rot, brown spots of bulbs and then bulbs rotting and spalling from the basal disc, plus a progressive yellowing and defoliation of the leaves from the base. Diseased plants were sampled from fields. Small pieces of symptomatic bulbs, stems, and roots from 10 different plants were surface disinfected with 75% ethanol for 30 s, 3% sodium hypochlorite for 5 min, and then washed three times in sterilize distilled water. The tissues were placed onto Martin Agar (2) at 25°C for 7 days. Nine isolates with morphology similar to Fusarium were obtained from the diseased tissues. Isolates were transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA) and carnation leaf agar (CLA) and incubated at 25°C. Seven were identified as Fusarium oxysporum and one was F. solani, which have been reported as pathogens of lily in China (1). The other isolate, when grown on PDA, rapidly produced dense, white aerial mycelium that became pink with age and formed red pigments in the medium. On CLA, macroconidia with three to five septate were abundant, relatively slender, and curved to lunate. Microconidia were abundant, oval or pyriform, and one to two celled. Chlamydospores were in chains with smooth exine. The rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and a portion of the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF-1α) gene of the fungus were amplified, with universal primers ITS1/ITS4 and EF1/EF2 primers respectively (3) and sequenced. In addition, the β-tubulin gene (β-tub) of the fungus was amplified with modified primers Btu-F-F01 (5'-CAGACMGGTCAGTGCGTAA-3') and Btu-F-R01 (5'-TCTTGGGGTCGAACATCTG-3') (4). BLASTn analysis showed that the ITS sequences of the isolate (GenBank Accession No. JX989827) had 98.9% similarity with those of F. tricinctum (EF611092, JF776665, and HM776425) and the EF-1α sequences of the isolate (JX989828) had 98.1% similarity with those of F. tricinctum (EU744837 and JX397850). The β-tub sequences of the isolate (JX989829) had 99.0% similarity with those of F. tricinctum (EU490236 and AB587077). The isolate was tested for pathogenicity. Two-month-old 'Sorbonne' seedlings were inoculated by placing 5 ml of conidial suspension (about 106 conidia per ml) over the roots of plants in each pot. Control plants were treated with sterile water in the same way. Plants were placed in a greenhouse at 22 to 25°C with a 15-h photoperiod. There were eight plants per pot and three replicates for each treatment. After 3 weeks, 87.5% of the inoculated plants exhibited browning of the root tips, root rot, and yellowing of the leaves, while control plants were symptomless. The pathogen was reisolated from the infected roots and identified as F. tricinctum, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Fusarium wilt of lily caused by F. tricinctum. This information will provide guidance for the control of lily wilt disease and add information useful for the production of lilies. References: (1) C. Li and J. J. Li. Acta Phytopathol. Sin.

17448,First Report of Spot Form Net Blotch Caused by Pyrenophora teres f. maculata on Barley in the Mon-Dak Area of the United States.,"Pyrenophora teres Drechs. causes net blotch of barley, a common foliar disease in cultivation zones around the world. The disease occurs in two forms, namely a net form net blotch (NFNB) caused by P. teres f. teres and a spot form net blotch (SFNB) caused by P. teres f. maculata. As in other parts of the northern Great Plains, in the Mon-Dak area (western North Dakota and eastern Montana), NFNB is prevalent. SFNB was first reported in western Montana in 1983 (1) and more recently in eastern North Dakota in 2010 (3) but not in the Mon-Dak area. In the summer of 2011, unusual spot lesions that were surrounded by necrosis or chlorosis were observed on different barley cultivars in fields at Williston, ND, Nesson Valley, ND, and Sidney, MT areas. Diseased leaves from various barley cvs. from the three locations were transferred to water agar and incubated at room temperature for 24 h to induce sporulation. Morphological examination of conidia (45 to 169 × 15 to 21 μm) did not show significant differences from a known isolate of P. teres f. teres 0-1 (provided by Tim Friesen, ARS, Fargo, ND). For pathogenicity testing, six 14-day-old plants of barley cv. Tradition were sprayed until runoff with a 2,000 spore/ml suspension of two isolates from each location and the control P. teres f. maculata isolate DEN2.6 (provided by Tim Friesen). Plants were incubated first in a lighted humidity chamber for 24 h and then in a greenhouse for 7 days at 21°C. Regardless of inoculum source, spot lesions surrounded by necrosis or chlorosis, typical of SFNB, appeared on the inoculated leaves within 7 days. Fungi isolated from symptomatic leaves were identified as P. teres and the morphology of the conidia was undistinguishable from those of P. teres f. teres. All control plants which were sprayed with sterile distilled water were symptomless. The pathogenicity test was repeated. Rapid PCR detection and amplicon sequencing (2) of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal genes was performed on field and pathogenicity test leaf lesion samples to confirm the presence of P. teres f. maculata. DNA templates were prepared using the Extract-N-Amp Plant PCR Kits (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and subjected to PCR using ITS1 and ITS4 primers. Amplicons were then purified and sequenced. The 585-bp nucleotide sequences of P. teres f. maculata from Mon-Dak area were submitted to GenBank under accession nos. PtmNES1 (JX187587), PtmSDY1 (JX187588), PtmSDY2 (JX187589), and PtmWIL1 (JX187590). The sequences from the four locations shared 100% similarity and also with P. teres f. maculata (EF452471) from GenBank while showing 10 nucleotide differences (99% similarity) with P. teres f. teres (EF452472).The results represent first report of SFNB in the Mon-Dak. Barley is one of the most important crops in the area. Resistance of the NFNB and SFNB of barley are controlled by different genes (4). Based on this report, SFNB therefore have to be considered in selection of barley cultivars for cultivation in the area. References: (1) H. E Bockelman et al. Plant Dis. 67:696, 1983. (2) R. T.

17442,First Report of Fruit Rot on Schisandra chinensis Caused by Penicillium glabrum and P. adametzii in China.,"Schisandra (Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill) is an important medicinal herb in China, which is mainly used for treatment of insomnia and memory decay. In September 2010, rot was observed on approximately 5% of the fruits during ripening of schisandra in several orchards at Linjiang City and Ji'an City, Jilin Province. Watery spots on infected fruits of schisandra appeared at the end of ripening, and then the fruits darkened in color, shrunk, and turned soft. The surface of the lesions became covered with masses of blue-green mycelium, conidiophores, and conidia under high humidity. To isolate the causal agent, conidia and conidiophores were suspended in sterile water and streaked onto the surface of potato dextrose agar (PDA). Single hyphal tips were then transferred to new PDA plates to be purified. The isolates were then cultured on CYA (Czapek yeast extract agar) and two kinds of strains (wwzqm1 and wwzqm2) were established based on differential growth rate, microscopic features, and colony color. Pathogenicity of each strain was tested on 25 healthy mature fruits of schisandra cv. Red Pearl by inoculating the fruit surface with a 15 μl conidial suspension (106 conidia/ml). Control fruits were treated with sterile water. Fruits were kept at 25°C and 90% relative humidity. After a 5-day incubation, symptoms described above were observed on all inoculated fruits, whereas all control fruits were symptomless. The causal agent was reisolated, confirming Koch's postulates. Strain wwzqm1 was identified as Penicillium glabrum (Wehmer) Westling on the basis of its morphology. Conidiophores arose from basal hyphae, with stipes smooth or finely roughened, 50.5 to 300.0 × 2.5 to 3.5 μm, penicillus monoverticillate, and bearing verticils of 8 to 12 phialides. Conidia were globose to subglobose, approximately 2.9 to 3.5 μm in diameter, with smooth or nearly smooth walls, and conidial chains in compact columns. Colonies grown for 7 days on CYA at 25°C attained a diameter of 32.4 to 39.1 mm, with the center of a deep bluish green, plane, velutinous, and heavily sporulated. Margin mycelium of the colony was white, with a yellowish brown under surface. Strain wwzqm2 was identified as P. adametzii K. M. Zalessky according to its morphological features with conidiophores born from funicolose hyphae, stipes smooth, 10.2 to 20.1 × 1.5 to 2.5 μm, penicillus monoverticillate, and bearing verticils of 4 to 6 phialides. Conidia were nearly globose to glubose, 2.0 to 2.7 μm in diameter, with smooth or finely roughened walls, and conidial chains loose and irregular. Colonies on CYA at 25°C for 7 days grew rather fast and reached a diameter of 50.3 to 60.2 mm, and were deep grayish green, near plane, floccose or funicolose, and heavily sporulated. Margin mycelium of the colony was white with a yellowish brown under surface (1). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) was amplified for wwzqm1 and wwzqm2 using primers ITS4/ITS5 and sequenced. BLASTn analysis of the 595 bp wwzqm1 (GenBank Accession No. JN887323) amplicon had 99% sequence identity with P. glabrum (DQ681321) and the 568 bp wwzqm2 amplicon (JN887322) had 99% sequence identity with P. adametzii (AF033401).

17334,First Report of Corynespora cassiicola Causing Leaf Spot on Akebia trifoliate.,"Akebia species have been used for centuries in medicinal practices in a few Asian countries such as China and Japan. The dried stems of Akebia trifoliata are known as mutong in the Chinese pharmacopoeia (4) and mokutsu in Kampo, the traditional Chinese medicine developed in Japan (2). In China, the plant is grown in the provinces of Shandong, Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Gansu, and some provinces in the south of the Yangtze River basin. During the summer of 2012, a leaf spot disease was detected on A. trifoliata grown in Nanning, Guangxi, China. The disease occurred and spread rapidly in July under conditions of high temperature and high humidity. The symptoms appeared on three sites that we inspected; disease incidences were higher than 80%. Initial symptoms consisted of small (less than 5 mm in diameter), circular, purple-brown leaf spots. Spots later enlarged and became elliptical, circular, or irregular with gray-white centers and dark brown rims. The centers were slightly concave. The spots could coalesce with each other, resulting in leaf desiccation and wilting. A fungal isolate was obtained from symptomatic leaf tissue that taken from a field (22°50'N, 108°22'E) in Nanning, Guangxi, China. Single-spore culture of the isolate was incubated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) for 7 days in the dark at 28°C. Conidiophores were straight to slightly curved, unbranched, and pale brown. Conidia (19.0 to 140.5 μm long and 7.0 to 11.0 μm wide) were formed singly or in chains, obclavate to cylindrical, straight or curved, pale brown, with a rounded apex and truncate base, and 1 to 13 pseudosepta. Morphological characteristics of the isolate were similar to the descriptions of Corynespora cassiicola (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) C.T. Wei (1). Genomic DNA of the isolate was extracted and used for PCR amplification of rDNA-ITS (internal transcribed spacer) sequence with primers ITS1 and ITS4. The PCR products were purified and sequenced. The sequence (GenBank Accession No. KC977496) was used in BLAST searches to interrogate GenBank for sequence similarity. High sequence similarity of 100% was obtained with several C. cassiicola strains. Pathogenicity of the isolate was investigated to demonstrate Koch's postulate. Young, healthy, fully expanded green leaves of A. trifoliata were surface sterilized. Fifteen leaves were inoculated with 10-μl drops of conidia suspension (105 conidia per ml) and 10 leaves were inoculated with the same volume of sterile water to serve as controls. All the leaves were placed in a humid chamber for 5 days. Spots with similar symptoms to those observed in the field developed on all inoculated leaves. The pathogen was reisolated and identified as C. cassiicola. The controls remained symptomless. According to previous reports, A. trifoliata was infected by Alternaria tenuissima in China and by Colletotrichum acutatum in Japan (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. cassiicola found on Akebia species worldwide. Furthermore, this new disease primarily affects plantations and reduces the quality and yield of the medicine. Some effective measures should be taken to control this disease. References: (1) M. B.

17245,First Report of Pyrimethanil Resistance in Botrytis cinerea from Stored Apples in Pennsylvania.,"Botrytis cinerea Pers.: Fr. (teleomorph Botryotinia fuckeliana [de Bary] Whetzel) causes gray mold on apple fruit. A survey of commercial packinghouses in Washington State revealed that it accounted for 28% of the decay in storage (1). Fungicide application coupled with cultural practices are the primary method of control as all commercial apple cultivars are susceptible to gray mold. In February 2013, gray mold was observed at ~5% incidence for commercially packed 'Gala' apple fruit that had been treated with Penbotec (active ingredient: pyrimethanil, Shield-Bright, Pace International) prior to controlled atmosphere storage in Pennsylvania. Eight infected apple fruit were collected, placed in 80 count boxes on cardboard trays, and stored at 4°C. One isolate was obtained from each decayed apple, placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) petri plates, and incubated at 20°C with natural light. Eight single-spore isolates were identified as B. cinerea based on cultural characteristics. Species level identification was executed by obtaining mycelial genomic DNA, amplifying the ITS rDNA, and sequencing the ~550-bp amplicon directly (2). MegaBLAST analysis of the 2X consensus for the 8 isolates revealed 100% identity to B. cinerea ITS sequences in GenBank (KF156296.1 and JX867227.1) with E values of 0.0, thus confirming the morphological identification. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined using conidial suspensions obtained from ~14-day-old plates (104 spores/ml) and a range (0 to 500 μg/ml) of technical grade pyrimethanil on three replicated 96-well microtiter plates containing a defined medium for each experiment. Conidial proliferation was inhibited at 250 μg/ml for all eight isolates and the experiment was conducted four times. To further define the resistance levels between the isolates, mycelial growth analysis using a plug of actively growing mycelium from the margin of ~3-day-old plates was conducted with a defined medium three times with technical grade pyrimethanil with three plates per experiment. Five isolates grew at 250 μg/ml (highly resistant), while three did not (moderately resistant). To assess resistance in vivo, organic 'Gala' apples were rinsed with soap and water, sprayed with 70% ethanol, placed on trays, and allowed to air dry. Apples were wounded with a sterile finishing nail, inoculated with 20 μl of a conidial suspension (104 spores/ml) of either a moderately or a highly resistant isolate, and dipped in the labeled application rate of Penbotec at 500 μg/ml or sterile water for 30 s. Fruit were stored in 100 count boxes at 22°C for 5 days and decay incidence and severity were recorded. Ten fruit composed a replicate per treatment and the experiment was repeated. Water inoculated controls were symptomless and water-dipped inoculated fruit had 100% decay. Penbotec-treated fruit had 100% decay incidence and mean lesion diameters of 37.6 (±13.1 mm) for the highly, and 35.7 (±9.0 mm) for the moderately resistant isolate. This is the first report of pyrimethanil resistance in B. cinerea from decayed apples collected from a commercial packinghouse in Pennsylvania. The results indicate that pyrimethanil resistance has developed in B. cinerea, which can result in control failures on Penbotec-treated fruit during storage. Furthermore, it emphasizes the need for additional tools to manage gray mold on apple fruit and may pose issues for export concerning the spread of fungicide-resistant inoculum. References: (1) Y.-K.

16795,First Report of Postharvest Fruit Rot in Persimmon Caused by Phacidiopycnis washingtonensis in Italy.,"Persimmon (Diospyros kaki L.) is widely grown in Italy, the leading producer in Europe. In the fall of 2009, a previously unknown rot was observed on 3% of fruit stored at temperatures between 5 and 15°C in Torino Province (northern Italy). The decayed area was elliptical, firm, and appeared light brown to dark olive-green. It was surrounded by a soft margin. The internal decayed area appeared rotten, brown, and surrounded by bleached tissue. On the decayed tissue, black pycnidia that were partially immersed and up to 0.5 mm in diameter were observed. Light gray conidia produced in the pycnidia were unicellular, ovoid or lacriform, and measured 3.9 to 6.7 × 2.3 to 3.5 (average 5.0 × 2.9) μm. Fragments (approximately 2 mm) were taken from the margin of the internal diseased tissues, cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at temperatures between 23 and 26°C under alternating light and darkness. Colonies of the fungus initially appeared ash colored and then turned to dark greenish gray. After 14 days of growth, pycnidia and conidia similar to those described on fruit were produced. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified using the primers ITS4/ITS6 and sequenced. BLAST analysis (1) of the 502-bp segment showed a 100% similarity with the sequence of Phacidiopycnis washingtonensis Xiao & J.D. Rogers (GenBank Accession No. AY608648). The nucleotide sequence has been assigned the GenBank Accession No. GU949537. Pathogenicity tests were performed by inoculating three persimmon fruits after surface disinfesting in 1% sodium hypochlorite and wounding. Mycelial disks (10 mm in diameter), obtained from PDA cultures of one strain were placed on wounds. Three control fruits were inoculated with plain PDA. Fruits were incubated at 10 ± 1°C. The first symptoms developed 6 days after the artificial inoculation. After 15 days, the rot was very evident and P. washingtonensis was consistently reisolated. Noninoculated fruit remained healthy. The pathogenicity test was performed twice. Since P. washingtonensis was first identified in the United States on decayed apples (2), 'Fuji', 'Gala', 'Golden Delicious', 'Granny Smith', 'Red Chief', and 'Stark Delicious', apple fruits also were artificially inoculated with a conidial suspension (1 × 106 CFU/ml) of the pathogen obtained from PDA cultures. For each cultivar, three surface-disinfested fruit were wounded and inoculated, while three others served as mock-inoculated (sterile water) controls. Fruits were stored at temperatures ranging from 10 to 15°C. First symptoms appeared after 7 days on all the inoculated apples. After 14 days, rot was evident on all fruit inoculated with the fungus, and P. washingtonensis was consistently reisolated. Controls remained symptomless. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of P. washingtonensis on persimmon in Italy, as well as worldwide. The occurrence of postharvest fruit rot on apple caused by P. washingtonensis was recently described in the United States (3). In Italy, the economic importance of the disease on persimmon fruit is currently limited, although the pathogen could represent a risk for apple. References: (1) S. F. Altschul et al.

17281,First Report of Leaf Spot Caused by Pseudocercospora pruni-persicicola on Sweet Cherry in Korea.,"Sweet cherry, Prunus avium (L.) L., is not much cultivated in Korea, with only 150 ha planted for domestic consumption. In September 2012, a previously unknown leaf spot was observed with nearly 100% incidence on trees (cv. Seneca) planted in a plastic greenhouse in Iksan City of Korea. Interestingly, the same cultivar as well as other cultivars planted outdoors did not show these symptoms. Leaf spots were irregular to subcircular, dark brown with or without a yellow halo, and becoming coalesced to cause leaf blight and premature defoliation. A cercosporoid fungus was consistently associated with disease symptoms. Fungal structures within the lesion developed on both leaf sides but mostly on the upper side. Stromata were well-developed, globular, dark brown, composed of textura angularis-globosa, and 30 to 80 μm in diameter. Conidiophores were densely fasciculate, pale olivaceous to pale brown, subcylindrical, geniculate-sinuous, 8 to 24 × 3 to 4 μm, and aseptate to 2-septate. Conidiogenous loci were inconspicuous, neither thickened nor darkened. Conidia were olivaceous, generally darker than conidiophores, cylindrical to obclavate, almost straight to mildly curved, short obconically truncate at the base, obtuse at the apex, 1- to 10-septate, constricted at the septa, 12 to 86 × 3.5 to 5 μm, guttulate, and had unthickened, not darkened hila. Morphological characteristics of the fungus were consistent with previous descriptions of Pseudocercospora pruni-persicicola (J.M. Yen) J.M. Yen (1,3). A voucher specimen was deposited in the Korea University herbarium (Accession No. KUS-F27264) and a monoconidial isolate was deposited in the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection (Accession No. KACC47019). The complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified with the primers ITS1/ITS4 (4) and sequenced. The resulting 505-bp sequence was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. KF670713). A BLAST search in GenBank revealed that the sequence showed >99% similarity with sequences of many Pseudocercospora species, indicating the close phylogenetic relationship of species in this genus. To conduct a pathogenicity test, a conidial suspension (~1 × 104 conidia/ml) was prepared in sterile water by harvesting conidia from 2-week-old cultures on V8 juice agar, and the suspension was sprayed until runoff onto the leaves of five healthy seedlings. Control plants were sprayed with sterile water. The plants were covered with plastic bags to maintain a relative humidity of 100% for 48 h and then transferred to a greenhouse. Necrotic spots appeared on the inoculated leaves 20 days after inoculation, and were identical to the ones observed in the field. P. pruni-persicicola was re-isolated from symptomatic leaf tissues, fulfilling Koch's postulates. Control plants remained symptomless. The fungus has previously been recorded on Prunus persica (L.) Stokes in Taiwan (2,3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of this fungus on P. avium globally as well as in Korea. The disease poses a new threat to the sweet cherry industry in Korea.

17311,First Report of Sydowia polyspora on Aleppo Pine (Pinus halepensis) in Italy.,"Pinus halepensis Mill. is a pine native to the Mediterranean region that is generally located from sea level up to an altitude of 200 meters. In July 2012, extensive leaf yellowing and scorching were observed on the foliage of two specimens of P. halepensis in a public park of Alassio municipality, Liguria region (northern Italy). Diseased needles showed chlorotic and reddish brown colored areas that were randomly distributed among healthy needles. In order to isolate the potential pathogen, diseased needle tissues were surface sterilized for 1 min in 1% NaOCl and plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with 100 ppm of streptomycin sulfate. After 7 to 10 days, a brown to dark green mycelium slowly developed on the PDA. From the mycelium, single cell conidia averaging 7.0 (4.7 to 12.2) × 2.9 (2.4 to 5.4) μm (n = 50) were produced. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified using primers ITS1f/ITS4 and sequenced. A BLAST (1) search yielded 100% of maximum identity with Sydowia polyspora (Bref. & Tav.) E. Müller for ITS1f and ITS4. Pathogenicity was confirmed by inoculating 15 3-year-old plants (approximately 5 months after bud break) of P. halepensis grown singly in 8-cm diameter pots and maintained in greenhouse. Twelve of 15 plants were wounded by gently rubbing needles together. Five non-inoculated plants, with wounded and non-wounded branches, were kept as controls. Inoculations were carried out at 16.5 to 18.5°C. A suspension of S. polyspora conidia was made by adding 1 to 2 ml sterile water to the spore mass on 1-month-old PDA cultures in 9-cm petri dishes. Inoculum (107 spores/ml) was applied on the needles with a soft paint brush. After inoculation plants were covered with polythene bags for 5 days, kept at temperatures ranging from 5.5 to 26.4°C (average 14.5°C), and watered as needed. The inoculation trial was repeated once. All inoculated plants, both wounded and non-wounded, developed leaf yellowing and browning since the fifth day after inoculation in both inoculation tests, while control plants remained symptomless. After 15 days from first symptom appearance, S. polyspora was re-isolated from the needles of inoculated plants according to the procedure already described. S. polyspora is associated with current season needle necrosis (CSNN) on various conifer species. P. halepensis was reported in Spain to be a susceptible host (2) and S. polyspora has been isolated from infected tissues of fir (Abies spp.) (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. polyspora on P. halepensis in Italy. Control of the pathogen with fungicides was ineffective on fir species, while application of very high rates of calcium chloride during shoot elongation was able to reduce the severity of CSNN (3). In forest areas, municipality gardens, and parks, effective management strategies have not yet been developed. References: (1) S. F. Altschul et al. Nucleic Acids Res. 25:3389, 1997. (2) L.

17517,First Report of Hyphodermella rosae Causing Dry Fruit Rot Disease on Plum in Iran.,"Plum (Prunus domestica) and peach (P. persica) are widely grown, often in alternate rows with citrus, in the Mazandaran Province of Iran. In June 2011, a dry fruit rot of plum was observed in several production regions in Mazandaran Province (35°47'N, 50°34'E). Initial symptoms at pit-hardening stage appeared as dark brown, circular, necrotic spots from 2 to 5 cm in diameter. They later developed into a dry fruit rot. Severe symptoms occurred during June and July when warm weather (temperature around 28°C) and high relative humidity (RH) (>85%) were present. Marketable yield losses reached 50% to almost 100% in many orchards. To isolate the causal organism, symptomatic fruits were surface disinfested for 1 min in 0.5% active chlorine, washed thoroughly with sterile distilled water, and segments were plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with 50 mg/liter of streptomycin sulfate and incubated at 25°C for 3 days. The fungus Hyphodermella rosae (Bresadola) Nakasone was consistently isolated (37 isolates from 79 samples) and identified on the basis of morphological characteristics on PDA. Basidiomata were effuse, resupinate, 15 × 10 mm, crustaceous, tubercules small with apical bristles, and light orange to grayish orange. Subhymenium was up to 30 μm thick, composed of vertically arranged, short-celled, nonagglutinated hyphae; subhymenial hyphae were 3 to 4 μm in diameter. Basidiospores were ellipsoid, 7.5 to 8.5 × 4.5 to 5.5 μm (100 determination), and their cell walls were thin, hyaline, and smooth (1). Genomic DNA was extracted from mycelium with a DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's directions and grown on potato dextrose broth for 4 days at 28°C. The rDNA region was amplified with the primers ITS4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3') and ITS5 (5'- GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAA-3') (4) and the PCR product was sequenced. Nucleotide BLAST analysis of the amplified 627-bp fragment confirmed a 99% similarity with the sequence of H. rosae (GenBank Accession No. JN593086). A pathogenicity test was conducted with isolate MA4099 by placing 5-day-old mycelial plugs grown on PDA at the surface of healthy fruit (n = 6) incubated under >85% RH at 25°C for at least 4 days until the appearance of symptoms, which were similar to those displayed under orchard conditions. Control fruits, inoculated with blocks of PDA plugs, remained intact and symptomless. Reisolation from inoculated fruit samples consistently yielded the inoculated fungus, completing Koch's postulates. The genus Hyphodermella has been reported to be causing wood rot on apricot (2) and sweet and sour cherry (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of H. rosae causing dry fruit rot on a stone fruit species in the world. References: (1) K. K. Nakasone. Mycologie, 29:231, 2008. (2) J. M. Ogawa et al.

18446,Enrichment culture and identification of endophytic methanotrophs isolated from peatland plants.,"Aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) are an environmentally significant group of microorganisms due to their role in the global carbon cycle. Research conducted over the past few decades has increased the interest in discovering novel genera of methane-degrading bacteria, which efficiently utilize methane and decrease the global warming effect. Moreover, methanotrophs have more promising applications in environmental bioengineering, biotechnology, and pharmacy. The investigations were undertaken to recognize the variety of endophytic methanotrophic bacteria associated with Carex nigra, Vaccinium oxycoccus, and Eriophorum vaginatum originating from Moszne peatland (East Poland). Methanotrophic bacteria were isolated from plants by adding sterile fragments of different parts of plants (roots and stems) to agar mineral medium (nitrate mineral salts (NMS)) and incubated at different methane values (1-20% CH4). Single colonies were streaked on new NMS agar media and, after incubation, transferred to liquid NMS medium. Bacterial growth dynamics in the culture solution was studied by optical density-OD600 and methane consumption. Changes in the methane concentration during incubation were controlled by the gas chromatography technique. Characterization of methanotrophs was made by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with Mg705 and Mg84 for type I methanotrophs and Ma450 for type II methanotrophs. Identification of endophytes was performed after 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and mmoX gene amplification. Our study confirmed the presence of both types of methanotrophic bacteria (types I and II) with the predominance of type I methanotrophs. Among cultivable methanotrophs, there were different strains of the genus Methylomonas and Methylosinus. Furthermore, we determined the potential of the examined bacteria for methane oxidation, which ranged from 0.463 ± 0.067 to 5.928 ± 0.169 μmol/L CH4/mL/day.",Stępniewska Z; Goraj W; Kuźniar A; Łopacka N; Małysza M,Folia microbiologica,2017,10.1007/s12223-017-0508-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996534494982791,TRUE,2,22,Low,sterile,isolated; culture; incubated; medium; agar; sterile; rrna; FISH; examined; fluorescence; examined; studied,vaginatum originating from Moszne peatland (East Poland).

17225,"First Report of Leaf Spot Caused by Alternaria alternata on Marigold (Tagetes erecta) in Beijing, China.","Marigold (Tagetes erecta) is an important commercial crop and 200 ha are planted every year in the Beijing district of China. A leaf spot disease of T. erecta was observed during 2012 and 2013 in the Beijing district. The disease was widespread, with 60 to 75% of the fields affected. Leaves of the affected plants had small, brown, necrotic spots on most of the foliage. Yield losses of flowers of up to 20 to 30% were reported. The spots gradually enlarged, becoming irregular in shape, or remained circular, and with concentric rings or zones. In the later stages of infection, the spots coalesced, and the leaves withered, dried, and fell from the plants (4). A fungus was consistently isolated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) from the infected leaves of T. erecta. After 6 days of incubation at 26°C and a 12-h photoperiod, the fungus produced colonies that were flat, with a rough upper surface (2). The conidiophores were short. Conidia varied from 18 × 6 to 47 × 15 μm and were medium to dark brown or olive-brown in color, short beaked, borne in long chains, oval and bean shaped, with 1 to 5 transverse septa and 0 to 2 longitudinal septa. The rDNA of the internal transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2 and the 5.8S gene in seven isolates were amplified using primers ITS1 (5'-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3') and ITS4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3'). The nucleotide sequence was the same as isolate No. 7, which was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. KF307207). A BLAST search showed 97% identity with the strain Alternaria alternata GNU-F10 (KC752593). Seven isolates were also confirmed as A. alternata by PCR identification performed by specific primers (C_for/C_rev) of A. alternata (1). Seven isolates were grown on PDA for 2 weeks and the conidia harvested. A 5-μl drop of spore suspension (1 × 105 spores/ml) was placed on each leaflet of 140 detached, surface-sterilized T. erecta leaves. Twenty leaves were inoculated with sterile distilled water as a control. The leaves were incubated in a growth chamber at 80 to 90% relative humidity, 50 to 60 klx/m2 light intensity, and a 12-h photoperiod. After 6 days, leaf spots similar to the original developed at inoculation sites for all isolates and A. alternata was consistently re-isolated. The control leaves remained symptomless. The pathogenicity test was performed three times. Leaf spot of T. erecta caused by Alternaria spp. is well known in Asian countries such as Japan (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. alternata on T. erecta in the Beijing district of China. References: (1) T. Gat. Plant Dis. 96:1513, 2012. (2) E. Mirkova. J.

17248,First Report of Colletotrichum fioriniae Causing Postharvest Decay on 'Nittany' Apple Fruit in the United States.,"Bitter rot of apple is caused by Colletotrichum acutatum and C. gleosporioides and is an economically important disease in the mid-Atlantic and southern regions of the United States (1). However, other Colletotrichum spp. have been found to infect apple and pear fruit in Croatia that include C. fioriniae and C. clavatum (3). The disease is favorable under wet, humid conditions and can occur in the field or during storage causing postharvest decay (2). In February 2013, 'Nittany' apples with round, brown, dry, firm lesions having acervuli in concentric rings were observed at a commercial cold storage facility in Pennsylvania. Samples were placed on a paper tray in an 80-count apple box and immediately transported to the lab. Fruit were rinsed with sterile water, and lesions were sprayed with 70% ethanol until runoff. The skin was aseptically removed with a scalpel, and tissue under the lesion was placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) petri dishes. Dishes were incubated at 25°C with constant light, and a single-spore isolate was propagated on PDA. Permanent cultures were maintained as PDA slants stored at 4°C in darkness. The isolate was identified as a Colletotrichum sp. based on culture morphology, having light gray mycelium with a pinkish reverse and abundant pin-shaped melanized acervuli oozing pink conidia on PDA. Conidia were fusiform, pointed at one or both ends, one-celled, thin-walled, aseptate, hyaline, and averaged 10.5 μm (7.5 to 20 μm) long and 5.1 μm (5 to 10 μm) wide (n = 50). Genomic DNA was extracted from mycelia and amplified using conventional PCR and gene specific primers for 313 bp of the Histone 3 gene and with ITS4/5 primers for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA region. MegaBLAST analysis of both gene sequences showed that our isolate was identical to other Colletotrichum fioriniae sequences in GenBank and was 100% identical to culture-collection C. fioriniae isolate CBS:128517, thus confirming the morphological identification. To prove pathogenicity, Koch's postulates were conducted using organic 'Gala' apple fruit that were washed with soap and water, sprayed with 70% ethanol, and wiped dry. The fruit were wounded with a sterile nail to a 3-mm depth, inoculated with 50 μl of a conidial suspension (1 × 104 conidia/ml), and stored at 25°C in 80-count boxes on paper trays for 14 days. Lesion diameter was measured from 10 replicate fruit with a digital micrometer and averaged 31.2 mm (±2.5 mm) over two experiments (n = 20). Water-only controls were symptomless. Artificially inoculated 'Gala' apples had identical external and internal symptoms (v-shaped decay pattern when the fruit were cut in half) to those observed on 'Nittany' apples that were originally obtained from cold storage. Bitter rot caused by C. fioriniae may become an emerging problem for the pome fruit growing industry in the near future, and may require investigation of new disease management practices to control this fungus. This is the first report of postharvest decay caused by C. fioriniae on apple fruit from cold storage in the United States. References: (1) H. W. Anderson. Diseases of Fruit Crops.

16786,First Report of Penicillium glabrum Causing a Postharvest Fruit Rot of Pomegranate (Punica granatum) in the Piedmont Region of Italy.,"Pomegranates (Punica granatum L.) are widely grown in many tropical and subtropical countries, especially in the moderate climate of the Mediterranean Region. In Italy, pomegranates are harvested from September to November. During October and November 2009 in Orbassano (Piedmont Region), postharvest fruit rots were observed on pomegranates (cv. Dente di Cavallo) after 30 days of storage at 5°C. Infected fruits showed soft, brown tissues that later were covered with masses of green mycelium, conidiophores, and hyphae of a fungus. Tissues were excised from the margin between the healthy and diseased tissues on pomegranates and plated on potato dextrose agar amended with 25 μg of streptomycin per liter. The fungus recovered from the tissue produced abundant mycelium and conidia on PDA after 7 days at 20 ± 2°C. Colonies consisting of dense erect conidiophores appeared velvety, gray-green, and the reverse of PDA culture was usually yellow to yellow-orange. Conidiophores were monoverticilliate, consisting of an unbranched stipe, smooth to finely roughened, and germinating in a whorl of 10 to 12 phialides. Phialides were flask shaped and 8 to 12 × 3 to 3.5 μm. Conidia were produced in typical long columns, globose to subglobose, smooth to finely roughened, with walls somewhat echinulate, and ranging from 3 to 3.5 μm in diameter (3). Preliminary morphological identification of the fungus was confirmed by PCR using genomic DNA extracted from the mycelia of pure cultures. One sequence, obtained through the amplification of ribosomal region ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (4), was blasted in GenBank and showed 100% sequence coverage and 99% similarity to ribosomal sequences of Penicillium glabrum. The sequence was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. GU734815). Pathogenicity was tested on 10 ripe fruits (cv. Dente di Cavallo) surface sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite. To make inoculum, 7-day-old PDA cultures of the fungus were flooded with sterile water and scraped with a sterile spatula. Resulting suspensions were filtered through two layers of sterile cotton lint and brought to a final concentration of 105 conidia/ml with sterile distilled water. Conidial suspensions (30 μl) were placed on artificial wounds generated on the fruit surface. Control fruits were treated with sterile water. Ten days after inoculation, P. glabrum was reisolated on PDA from the inoculated fruit. Control fruits were symptomless. Previously, P. glabrum was reported on pomegranate in Greece (1). Other species of Penicillium, including P. expansum, P. implicatum, and P. purpurogenum, also were reported on pomegranate in the United States (2), Slovakia, and India, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. glabrum causing a postharvest fruit rot of pomegranate in Italy. References: (1) G. A. Bardas et al. Plant Dis. 93:1347, 2009. (2) A. M. French.

17387,First Report of Stem Wilt and Root Rot of Schlumbergera truncata Caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Opuntiarum in Southern Italy.,"Schlumbergera truncata (Haw.) Moran, belonging to the Cactaceae, is a very common ornamental cactus in southern Italy. In November 2011, sudden stem wilt and root rot was observed in about 45% of vegetatively propagated plants cultivated as potted ornamental plants in a commercial greenhouse in Cerignola (Foggia Province, Apulia, Italy). The roots and collars of the plants showed brown rot. Yellow sunken lesions that were similar to cortical cankers were detected at basal level of the stem. Ten plants with these symptoms were analyzed by fungal isolation techniques. Small (0.5 cm) tissue portions from root, collar, and basal stem were plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) after disinfection with 75% ethanol for 1 to 2 min, 0.2% NaOCl for 1 to 2 min, and a wash with sterile distilled water. A fungal isolate that was morphologically similar to Fusarium sp. was isolated from 85% of these tissue samples. It had nucleotide sequences of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) of ribosomal DNA (GenBank Accession No. KC196121) 100% identical to those of the comparable sequences of Fusarium oxysporum (HQ651161). The nucleotide sequences of its translation elongation factor 1-α (EF-1α) gene (KC196120) showed 100% identity to sequences of F. oxysporum f. sp. opuntiarum (DQ837689, AF246881) retrieved from GenBank. Pathogenicity tests were performed at 22 ± 3°C on 18 45-day-old plants of S. truncate by adding of a 5-ml aliquot of conidial suspension adjusted to 5 × 106 conidia/ml to soil of each plant. Six non-inoculated plants were used for a control treatment and sprayed with 5 ml of sterilized water. Plants were maintained in greenhouse at 22 ± 3°C. After 10 days, nine of the inoculated plants showed wilting, and after 45 days, all of them were dead, with root and collar rot and lesions on the basal stem. Control plants were symptomless. Koch's postulates were fulfilled as the pathogen was reisolated from all of the symptomatic tissues and identified as Fusarium sp. On the basis of 3-septate macroconidia (mean 31.75 × 3.21 μm; range, 26 to 35 μm long, 3.0 to 4.2 μm wide), aseptate microconidia, single chlamydospores, and monophialide conidiophores on carnation leaf agar, and molecular analyses, the fungus was identified as F. oxysporum f. sp. opuntiarum (Speg) (1,2,3). In Italy, F. oxysporum f. sp. opuntiarum was reported as basal stem rot of Echinocactus grusoni (4). To our knowledge, this is the first report of stem wilt and root rot of S. truncata caused by F. oxysporum f. sp. opuntiarum in Italy. References: (1) W. Gerlach. Phytopathol. Z. 74:197, 1972. (2) W.

14364,First report of Epicoccum nigrum causing brown leaf spot of loquat in southwestern China,"Eriobotrya japonica (Thunb.) Lindl., commercially known as loquat, is a subtropical evergreen fruit tree in the Rosaceae that is native to southern China. It is highly valued on the fresh market for its tasty and nutritional fruits, and its leaves have been used in natural medicine for the treatment of coughs and chronic bronchitis (Badenes et al. 2013). Tree growth and fruit production in China are under pressure from increased levels of leaf spot diseases. In November 2015, gray-brown necrotic spots ranging from 5 to 10 mm in diameter were observed on the adaxial surface of leaves of loquat trees growing in three orchards in Beibei District of Chongqing in southwestern China. Within these orchards, spotting affected 30 to 80% of leaves on individual trees over the course of the season. To isolate the causal agent, nine symptomatic leaves were surface disinfested and three small sections of each leaf were cut from the diseased area and placed onto PDA. After 7 days of incubation at 25°C, felty colonies of mycelia giving off a strong reddish-orange diffusible pigment appeared across the plate. Microscopy revealed globose to pyriform, dark, solitary, verrucose, and multicellular conidia measuring 14.3 to 28.6 μm diameter (n = 30) were produced on the myclia. The morphological characteristics of the mycelium and reproductive structures of the isolates fully fit the description of Epicoccum sp. (Sheikhloo et al. 2011). To further substantiate our identification, DNA was extracted from 10-day-old mycelia cultures and used to carry molecular phylogenetic analysis. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the sampled isolate was amplified using ITS1 and ITS4 universal primers and the resulting amplicon subjected to DNA sequencing. The resulting sequence (GenBank accession no. KY303832) shared 99% maximum identity with other reported isolates of E. nigrum (KT276979.1) found in public databases. To test the pathogenicity under Koch’s postulates, nine disease-free leaves were removed from a 2-year-old ‘Longquan No. 1’ tree and inoculated in vitro by injecting a suspension of ∼106 spores/ml using a sterile syringe into the lamina. In parallel, similar inoculations were made on disease-free leaves of trees growing under greenhouse conditions. Sterile water was used as a control and the entire experiment was replicated in triplicate. Symptoms were scored beginning at 5 days postinoculation. By 10 days postinoculation, spore-infected leaves showed the appearance of gray-brown necrotic spots identical to those observed in the field, whereas control leaves remained symptomless. The reisolated fungus was found to be identical morphologically and by DNA sequence analysis to the original isolate. Epicoccum nigrum has been reported on many hosts. For instance, it has been found to cause leaf spot on Lablab purpureus (Mahadevakumar et al. 2014) and as an endophyte on the grapevine (Martini et al. 2009).

16819,First Report of Anthracnose Caused by Colletotrichum acutatum on Mung Bean Sprouts in Taiwan.,"Mung bean sprouts (Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek) are a commonly consumed vegetable in Asian countries. Anthracnose lesions on mung bean sprouts (cv. You-lu-dou from Mayamar) were found in an indoor sprouting facility in Taichung County, Taiwan in May of 2009. The incidence of disease exceeded 90% in some lots. Infected hypocotyls had smooth, diamond-shaped to fusiform brown spots, which became further depressed and enlarged with age. A fungus was isolated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) from symptomatic hypocotyls after surface sterilization in 0.6% NaOCl. Fungal colonies were initially salmon to orange in color and became greenish gray on the surface within a week. Setae were not produced in acervuli that developed on PDA. Conidia in the acervuli were one-celled, cylindrical, and hyaline with an average length and width of 14.8 (7.0 to 23.7) × 4.9 (3.3 to 6.7) μm (n = 53). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was amplified with primers ITS1 and ITS4 (4). The sequence was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. GQ889269). The sequence was 99% identical to that of ATCC 56816 strain of Glomerella acutata (Guerber & J. C. Correll), the teleomorph of Colletotrichum acutatum (J. H. Simmonds) over a 522-bp alignment. Thus, the mung bean pathogen was identified as C. acutatum based on morphological (1) and molecular characters. Pathogenicity of the strain was determined by inoculating mung bean seeds from I-Mei Foods Co. (imported from Australia). The seeds were disinfested in 0.6% NaOCl for 10 min, rinsed with sterile distilled water twice, and immersed in a conidial suspension (1.5 × 104 conidia/ml) of C. acutatum for 10 min. Fifteen inoculated seeds were placed on moistened paper towels, distributed into three flasks, and stored in the dark at 32°C. Symptoms similar to those observed on the original sprouts appeared 3 days later on the hypocotyls of the seedlings and all seedlings were infected by day five. Conidia of C. acutatum were produced on all lesions and colonies of C. acutatum were recovered from symptomatic tissues, fulfilling Koch's postulates. Controls (seed immersed in water) remained symptomless. The pathogenicity test was repeated with similar results. The pathogen has been recorded on mung bean sprouts in Korea (2) and on other Vigna spp. in India (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of sprout rot of mung bean caused by C. acutatum in Taiwan. References: (1) B. J. Dyko and J. E. M. Mordue.

17433,First Report of Black Stem Caused by Botryosporium longibrachiatum on Sweet Basil in Korea.,"Sweet basil, Ocimum basilicum L., is cultivated mainly for fresh consumption in Korea. In March 2009, in Icheon, Korea, several dozen plants showing symptoms of black stems were found in an organic farm that used polyethylene tunnels for production. The black stems were usually covered with a fungus that gave the appearance of hoar-frost on the stems, especially when plants were grown under a cool and humid environment. According to the farmer, black stems appear during the winter season of November to March when the tunnels were mostly closed. The relative humidity (RH) during that period was around 100% every night due to poor ventilation. Beginning the middle of April when both sides of the tunnels were open, providing good ventilation, no further disease development was observed. The fungus on the stems had an elongate, upright conidiophore, reaching 5 mm in length. At intervals along its length, the main axis of conidiophores produced lateral fertile branches in acropetal succession. Each lateral branch terminated in a cluster of four or five ampullae. Conidia were hyaline, oval, and 5.5 to 9.5 × 3.5 to 6 μm. The fungus was non-pigmented and colonies on potato dextrose agar were chalk white. Morphological and cultural characteristics of the fungus were consistent with the previous reports of Botryosporium longibrachiatum (Oudem.) Maire (3,4). Voucher specimens (n = 4) were housed at Korea University Herbarium (KUS). An isolate from KUS-F24010 was deposited in the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection (Accession No. KACC44849) and used for molecular analysis and pathogenicity tests. The complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified with the primers ITS1/ITS4 and sequenced. The resulting sequence of 592 bp was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. JX666334). A BLAST search in GenBank showed that there was no comparable sequence of B. longibrachiatum and thus this was the first ITS sequence for the species submitted in GenBank. To confirm the pathogenicity, colonized mycelial plugs (3 mm in diameter) from 10-day-old PDA cultures were placed onto the stem apices (n = 10) of 2-month-old sweet basil pot plants, which were topped as normally harvested. Control plants were inoculated with uncolonized agar plugs. All plants were incubated at 22 ± 2°C in a humidified chamber with a 12-h photoperiod for 48 h, and then maintained in a greenhouse (22 ± 2°C). Three to four days after inoculation, necrotic lesions developed around the points of inoculation on all stems and expanded downwards, leading to black stems covered with the hoar-frost like fungus after 14 days. B. longibrachiatum was successfully reisolated from all inoculated stems, while control plants remained symptomless. The pathogenicity test was conducted twice with the same result. The association of B. longibrachiatum and sweet basil was previously reported (4). Several other plants including burley tobacco are also reported to be infected by this fungus (1,2). To our knowledge, this is the first etiological report of B. longibrachiatum on sweet basil globally as well as in Korea. References: (1) T. R. Anderson. Plant Dis. 67:1158, 1983. (2) D. F.

17342,First Report of Corynespora Leaf Spot on Beach Vitex Caused by Corynespora cassiicola in Korea.,"Beach vitex, Vitex rotundifolia L. fil., is a perennial that grows in temperate and tropical areas of the Pacific. In areas where it has been introduced outside of its native range, beach vitex has proven to be an invasive species. This plant dominates dune ecosystems leading to a reduction in the prevalence of native species (1). In October 2010, previously unknown leaf spots were observed on the beach vitex growing on sand dunes in Incheon City of Korea. The same symptoms were repeated in 2011 and 2012. In September 2012, the same leaf spots were found on the beach vitex in Samcheok and Gyeongju in Korea. The symptoms usually started as small, dark brown to purplish leaf spots with more or less concentric rings, eventually causing leaf blights or yellowing with 50% or more defoliation by the end of September. Representative samples (n = 6) were deposited in the Korea University Herbarium (KUS). Conidiophores of the fungus observed microscopically on the leaf spots were erect, brown to dark brown, single or occasionally in clusters, 80 to 500 × 5 to 9 μm, and mostly arose on the abaxial surface of symptomatic leaves. Conidia were borne singly or in short chains of 2 to 4, ranging from cylindrical to broadest at the base and tapering apically, straight to slightly curved, pale olivaceous brown, 1 to 12 pseudoseptate, 50 to 250 × 8 to 18 μm, each with a conspicuous thickened hilum. On potato dextrose agar (PDA), single-spore cultures of two isolates were identified as Corynespora cassiicola (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) C.T. Wei on the basis of morphological and cultural characteristics (3). Two monoconidial isolates were preserved at the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection (Accession Nos. KACC45712 and KACC46953). Isolate KACC45712 was used for molecular works and pathogenicity test. Genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini DNA Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified with the primers ITS1/ITS4 and sequenced. The resulting sequence of 520 bp was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. KC987359). A BLAST search in GenBank revealed that the sequence showed 100% identity with those of C. cassiicola (e.g., JQ801302). To conduct a pathogenicity test, a conidial suspension (ca. 2 × 104 conidia/ml) was prepared by harvesting conidia from 2-week-old cultures, and the suspension was sprayed onto the leaves of three healthy seedlings. Inoculated plants were kept in humid chambers for 48 h in a glasshouse. After 5 days, typical leaf spot symptoms started to develop on the leaves of all three inoculated plants. C. cassiicola was reisolated from the lesions, confirming Koch's postulates. Control plants treated with sterile water remained symptomless. C. cassiicola is cosmopolitan with a very wide host range (2,4). To our knowledge, C. cassiicola has not been reported on Vitex spp. anywhere in the world. According to field observations in Korea, Corynespora leaf spot was most severe in August and September, especially following a prolonged period of moist weather. C. cassiicola may be a potential biocontrol agent for this highly invasive species. References: (1) M. C. Cousins et al. Invasive Plant Sci. Manag. 3:340, 2010. (2) L. J. Dixon et al.

16771,First Report of Collar and Root Rot Caused by Phytophthora tentaculata on Witloof Chicory (Cichorium intybus) in Italy.,"Witloof chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) is an important crop in Italy where most of the crop is still produced in soil. In September 2009, chicory plants (cv. Pan di Zucchero) grown on a commercial farm in Tarquinia (central Italy) showed symptoms of a previously unknown disease. Symptoms, observed 20 days after transplanting, consisted of stunting, yellowing of leaves, and a crown and root rot. Affected plants turned brown, wilted, and eventually died. At the soil level, dark brown-to-black water-soaked lesions coalesced and often girdled the stem. All of the crown and root system was affected. At this location, the disease was severe and widespread, with 60% of observed plants being affected. A Phytophthora-like organism was consistently isolated on a medium selective for oomycetes (4) after disinfestation of lower stem and root pieces of C. intybus for 1 min in a solution containing 1% NaOCl. Tissue fragments of 1 mm2 were excised from the margins of the root and crown lesions. The pathogen genus was identified as Phytophthora based on morphological and physiological features. Sporangia were produced for identification by growing a pure culture for 15 days on modified V8 juice agar medium (Campbell V8 juice [200 ml], agar [15 g], CaCo3 [0.5 g], and sterile water [800 ml]) under alternating light and dark (12/12 h). Sporangia were pyriform to ovoid, papillate, and measured 33.3 to 59.2 × 18.9 to 30.2 μm (average 39.9 × 25.8 μm). Chlamydospores developed in 28-day-old cultures and measured 21.3 to 30.2 × 19.5 to 29.7 μm (average 24.4 × 23.6 μm). Oogonia were globose and measured 26 to 41 μm (average 32.5 μm). Eighty percent of antheridia were paragynous. Amphyginous antheridia (15 to 20%) were also observed. Oospores were scarcely produced and measured 24 to 32 μm in diameter. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA of a single isolate was amplified using the primers ITS4/ITS6 and sequenced. BLAST analysis (1) of the 851-bp segment showed 100% homology with the sequence of Phytophthora tentaculata. The nucleotide sequence has been assigned GenBank Accession No. GU949536. Pathogenicity of this isolate was confirmed by inoculating C. intybus cv. Pan di Zucchero plants 20 days after transplant. The same isolate was grown for 15 days on a mixture of 70:30 wheat/hemp kernels and then 5 g/liter of the inoculum was mixed into a substrate containing a mixture of blond and black peat (15:85 vol/vol), pH 5.5. Five plants per 2-liter pot were transplanted and four replicates were carried out. Twenty noninoculated plants represented the control treatment. The trial was repeated. Plants were kept in two growth chambers at two temperatures (20 and 25°C). Symptoms similar to those observed in the field developed 7 days after inoculation. Twenty days later, 100 and 40% of the plants were dead at 25 and 20°C, respectively. Control plants remained symptomless. P. tentaculata was consistently reisolated from symptomatic plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. tentaculata on C. intybus in the world ( http://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungaldatabases/index.cfm ). P. tentaculata was recently reported on lavender in Spain (2) and oregano in Italy (3). The economic importance of this disease is relatively low on most commercial farms. References: (1) S. F.

16854,First Report of Charcoal Rot on Canola Caused by Macrophomina phaseolina in Western Australia.,"In the spring of 2006, canola (Brassica napus L.) plants suffering from wilt were observed in an experimental plot at Merredin, Western Australia. Symptoms on the affected plants were tan-brown, longitudinal streaks along the main stem and on some lateral branches. Lesions on the stem were predominantly unilateral but sometimes covered the entire stem. Some of the lateral branches were completely wilted, and if present, pods were either shriveled or contained small seed. At the base of the stem, the lesions were grayish brown streaks that caused longitudinal splitting of the stem base. Small spherical (55 to 75 μm in diameter) and elongated (75 to 120 μm long) microsclerotia were seen in the pith and vascular region. Roots appeared to be symptomless, but upon removing the epidermis, grayish streaks were also seen on the roots and small sclerotia were observed in the pith and the vascular region of roots. One hundred and four small pieces (1 to 2 cm) of stem and root from 10 symptomatic plants were surface sterilized with 1.25% NaOCl, rinsed twice in sterile distilled water, and plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with 10 ppm of aureomycin. These were incubated under a blacklight at 22°C. Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid. was isolated from 80% of the pieces as identified by colony morphology and the size of microsclerotia that ranged between 50 and 190 μm (3). Eight-three isolates were obtained. None of the isolates produced pycnidia on PDA. However, pycnidia (100 to 190 μm) with pycnidiospores (17.5 to 30 × 7.5 to 10 μm) were produced on the affected stems collected from the field. Pathogenicity tests with one of the isolates were conducted on seven 2-week-old canola plants (cv. Stubby). Three uninoculated plants served as the control. Roots of 2-week-old plants were dipped in an aqueous conidial suspension (1 × 104 conidia/ml) of M. phaseolina for an hour while roots of control plants were dipped in sterile water. Inoculated and control plants were repotted in separate pots and transferred to a glasshouse. A week after inoculation, M. phaseolina produced chlorosis of the leaves, and subsequently, complete wilting and death of the inoculated plants. M. phaseolina was successfully reisolated from roots and stems of symptomatic plants. No symptoms developed on the control plants. Pathogenicity was also tested by soaking seeds of cv. Stubby with an aqueous conidial suspension of M. phaseolina for one-half hour and incubating on agar media after drying. Germinating seeds were colonized by the growing mycelium and seedlings were completely killed within a week. Abundant microsclerotia were produced on the dead seedlings. M. phaseolina has been previously reported on canola in the United States (1) and Argentina (2) and more recently has been reported on canola in eastern Australia (4). To our knowledge, this is the first record of occurrence of M. phaseolina on canola in Western Australia and its impact on canola yield needs to be determined. References: (1) R. E. Baird et al.

17123,First Report of Neofusicoccum parvum Causing Panicle Blight and Leaf Spot on Vitis heyneana in China.,"The climbing vine, Vitis heyneana Roem. & Schult, is a member of the grape family endemic to Asia. Its fruits are used in wine production, and its roots, stems, and leaves can be used in medicinal materials. This plant is grown in Southwest China, as well as in India, Bhutan, and Nepal. Mulao Autonomous County in Guangxi Province is the only artificial cultivation area in China. During the summer of 2013, a panicle blight and leaf spot were detected on V. heyneana on four farms in Mulao Autonomous County. The symptoms were observed from the onset of florescence through fruit harvest. Brown lesions initially appeared at the base of a panicle and then extended to the whole panicle, finally causing the panicle to die and fruit to drop. When the disease developed on leaves, the symptom initially appeared as small dark brown circular spots, later enlarging into irregular spots (average diameter 6 mm) with a light brown center and dark brown rim. With severe disease, some individual leaves were affected by numerous spots, leading to premature senescence. Small sections of diseased tissue excised from 10 panicle and 10 leaf samples were plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 28°C. Fungal colonies developed, initially with abundant white aerial mycelium, which turned olivaceous gray after 5 days and formed black pycnidia after 25 days. The conidia were hyaline, ellipsoidal to fusiform, externally smooth, thin-walled, and nonseptate. Thirty conidia were measured; the dimensions were 12.0 to 17.5 × 4.0 to 6.0 μm. Morphological characteristics of the isolates were similar to the descriptions of Neofusicoccum parvum (3). The isolate MPT-1 was selected as a representative for molecular identification. Genomic DNA was extracted and used for PCR to amplify the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-α) gene, using primers ITS1/ITS4 and EF1-728F/EF1-986R, respectively. The obtained ITS sequence (GenBank Accession No. KJ599627) and EF1-α sequence (KM921768) showed >99% homology with several GenBank sequences of N. parvum. Morphological and molecular results confirmed the isolate as N. parvum. For pathogenicity tests, detached, young healthy panicles and leaves of V. heyneana were surface-sterilized, wounded by sterile needle, and inoculated with mycelial plugs (3 mm in diameter) of four N. parvum isolates. Ten panicles and 10 leaves were used for every isolate. Control panicles and leaves were treated with sterile PDA plugs. All the samples were placed in a humid chamber (RH 90%, 28°C, 12 h of light) for 3 days. Symptoms similar to those observed in the field developed on all panicles and leaves inoculated with N. parvum isolates. N. parvum was reisolated from all inoculated, symptomatic tissues. The controls remained symptomless. N. parvum has been reported to cause trunk canker on V. vinifera (2), dieback on Cupressus funebris (3), and a leaf spot on Myristica fragrans (1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of N. parvum causing panicle blight and leaf spot on V. heyneana in China. Panicle blight caused a large number of fruits to drop and reduced the yield seriously. Some effective measures should be taken to control this disease. References: (1) V. Jayakumar et al. New Dis.

17414,First Report of Neofusicoccum australe and N. luteum Associated with Canker and Dieback of Quercus robur in Portugal.,"Quercus robur L., commonly known as ""pedunculate oak,"" is a long-lived deciduous tree native to most of Europe. It is of great ecological and forestry importance. It is also commonly cultivated as an ornamental tree in parks and gardens. Since 2009 and most likely related to increased drought periods, diseased ornamental trees have been observed in the campus of the University of Aveiro, Portugal. More than 50% of the trees are already damaged by the disease. The symptoms included twig and branch dieback and sunken necrotic bark lesions that could progress to the trunk, resulting in the death of large sections of the tree. Ascomata and conidiomata typical of Botryosphaeriaceae were observed on branches of symptomatic trees. Ascospores were hyaline, aseptate, ovoid to fusoid, and conidia were hyaline, aseptate, smooth, thin-walled, and fusiform with base truncate. Single spore isolates were obtained from samples. In culture, single ascospore isolates produced conidia similar to the ones found on the host. Diseased branch tissues were surface sterilized with 5% NaOCl, plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at 25°C. Fungal isolates recovered produced white aerial mycelium that darkened with age becoming grey to dark grey and conidia that were similar in all aspects to the ones produced by single spore isolates. All isolates produced on PDA a yellow pigment that diffused into the agar and disappeared after 6 to 7 days. Morphological and cultural aspects of the isolates were similar to the species Neofusicoccum luteum (Pennycook & Samuels) Crous, Slippers & A.J.L. Phillips and N. australe (Slippers, Crous & M.J. Wingf.) Crous, Slippers & A.J.L. Phillips (2). Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus (ERIC) PCR fingerprinting divided the isolates into two groups (1). Two isolates (CAA352 and CAA392), one from each group, were selected for further identification by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rDNA and part of the elongation factor 1-alpha gene (EF1-α) (Accession No. ITS: JX975212 JX975213; EF1-α: JX975210 JX975211). BLAST analysis showed that ITS and EF1-α sequences from group 1 and 2 had 99 to 100% similarity to reference cultures (including ex-type) of N. luteum and N. australe, respectively. To confirm pathogenicity and fulfill Koch's postulates, six 2-year-old seedlings of Q. robur were artificially infected with isolates CAA352 and CAA392 and kept at approximately 20 to 25°C. A shallow wound was done with a scalpel on the basal part of the stem of each seedling, a bark portion was removed aseptically and a PDA disc (0.5 cm) of an actively growing culture was placed on the wound. Control seedlings received sterile PDA discs. The inoculation site was wrapped in Parafilm to prevent desiccation. Within 8 weeks, infected seedlings developed canker lesions associated with vascular necrosis around the inoculation point. A third of the seedlings died and developed abundant pycnidia on the stem. Control seedlings remained symptomless. Both pathogens were successfully reisolated from the infected tissue. N. luteum and N. australe are increasingly reported as causing diseases to a wide range of woody hosts of economic and forestry importance (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of both species causing dieback and canker disease on Q. robur. References: (1) A. Alves et al. Res. Microbiol. 158:112, 2007. (2) P. W. Crous et al. Stud.

14333,First report of vine wilt disease caused by fusarium solani on sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubilis) in China,"Sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubilis L.) is native to the Amazon rainforest, where it has been cultivated by indigenous people for centuries. Because of its high protein and oil content and general nutritional quality, it is regarded as a promising oil crop. Sacha inchi was introduced to Xishuangbanna by Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China, in 2006, and about 13.5 ha has been cultivated as under-forest economy crop under Areca catechu trees in Lingshui, Hainan Province, China, since 2014. In June 2016, ∼85% of plants in a field of sacha inchi grown for seeds in Lingshui exhibited symptoms of chlorosis, defoliation, wilting, and/or death. Dissection of roots and vines of symptomatic plants revealed discolored vascular tissue. Symptomatic roots and vines’ pieces (∼5 × 5 mm) from four randomly selected plants were surface-sterilized with 70% ethanol solution treatment for 30 s, washed in sterile water three times, and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium. Resulting fungal colonies were subcultured using the single-spore method. The colonies on Spezieller Nährstoffarmer agar medium (SNA) plates had creamy white colored growth. Based on observations of 1-week-old isolates, microconidia were fusiform to oval with zero or one septum, dimensions of 7.6 to 17.9 × 2.7 to 5.5 μm (n = 20), and formed at the tips of long unbranched monophialides. Macroconidia were two to four septate, spindle to crescent-shaped, hyaline, and blunt on both ends, 12.2 to 49.4 × 3.2 to 7.5 μm (n = 50). Genomic DNA was extracted from representative isolate YJG3-2. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS), β-tubulin (TUB2), and translation elongation factor 1 (eEF-1α) sequences were amplified using primer pairs of ITS1/ITS4, Bt2a/Bt2b, and EF1-728F/EF1-986R, respectively. PCR products were sequenced and deposited in GenBank with accession numbers KX757042 (ITS), KX757044 (TUB2), and KX757046 (eEF-1α), respectively. A BLAST search revealed that all three sequences of isolate YJG3-2 showed 99% sequence homology with the ITS, TUB2, and eEF-1αsequences of Fusarium solani (KF999012.1, GQ121902.1, and KX454503.1, respectively) represented the best BLAST hit in GenBank. Based on morphological characteristics and sequences analysis, isolate YJG3-2 was identified as F.solani. Pathogenicity of this isolate was confirmed on sacha inchi plants in the greenhouse. Surface disinfected seeds of sacha inchi were immersed in sterilized water overnight and then cultivated in sterile soil in seedling tray until the four leaf stage. Healthy seedlings were selected and transplanted into plastic pots (15 cm diameter, 15 cm height) with sterilized soil after 2 weeks of growth. Ten 45-day-old healthy sacha inchi plants were directly inoculated by irrigating plants with a 50 μl drop of a mixed conidial suspension (106 conidia/ml) of isolate YJG3-2 into each pot near the plants’ roots without wounding after 7 days without watering, and control plants were inoculated with 50 μl of sterile distilled water (Uppala et al. 2013). Symptoms of chlorosis and wilt similar to those in the commercial field were observed over 6 months (September 2016 to April 2017) on 7 of 10 inoculated plants, while control plants were symptomless. Fungal isolates identical to F. solani were reisolated from the symptomatic plants. Sacha inchi is known to be extremely sensitive to Fusarium spp. and Meloidogyne spp. (Mendoza 2008, Senino et al. 2008), but to our knowledge, this is the first report of F. solani causing sacha inchi wilt disease in China. © 2017, American Phytopathological Society.

5618,Endophytic Beauveria bassiana can protect the rice plant from sheath blight of rice caused by Rhizoctonia solani and enhance plant growth parameters,"Beauveria bassiana, a potential entomopathogenic biocontrol agent, has recently drawn attention worldwide for its other additional beneficial roles such as plant disease antagonist, beneficial rhizosphere colonizer, plant growth promoter and an endophyte. In the present study, endophytic colonizing behaviour of five (5) B. bassiana isolates viz., Bb4, Bb16, Bb25, Bb44 and Bb53 were studied in rice following three (3) artificial inoculation techniques viz., seed treatment, root inoculation and foliar spray and the endophytic colonizing ability were determined by culture-based assay. After B. bassiana inoculation, rice plants were challenged with Rhizoctonia solani and disease incidence and plant growth promotion were assessed. Per cent colonization of rice stems, leaves and roots were influenced by inoculation technique, post-inoculation time (7th, 14th, 21st and 28th dpi) and plant growth medium (sterile soil, non-sterile soil), recorded maximum on 14th-day post-inoculation (dpi) i.e., 96% in stems, 92% in leaves and 28% in roots, whereas, lower colonization was recorded on 7th, 21st and 28th dpi. Whereas, the foliar spray was found best as compared to seed and root inoculation techniques, and maximum fungal recovery was observed in stems and leaves and least in roots. Upon colonization, the physical presence of B. bassiana in rice was localized by light microscopy-based studies. Potential B. bassiana strains with endophytic ability were re-isolated and their identity was determined based on morphometric and PCR-based techniques. Further, the present study also identified several virulent genes viz., BbChit1, Cdep1, Bbhog1 and Bbjen1 and extracellular hydrolytic enzymes viz., alpha-amylase, cellulase, lipase, pectinase and xylanase secreted by endophytic B. bassiana strains as determinants responsible for establishing the endophytic association in rice. On the other hand, a significant reduction in disease incidence was observed in the endophytic B. bassiana Bb4-, Bb16- and Bb44-inoculated plants as compared to the non-endophytic B. bassiana Bb25- and Bb53-inoculated plants along with enhanced plant growth promotion. This is one of the few studies investigating the colonization of B. bassiana in rice and its promising role as a plant disease antagonist and plant growth promoter in rice.","Deb, L; Dutta, P; Devi, RKT; Thakuria, D; Majumder, D",ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY,2022,10.1007/s00203-022-03211-2,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.981821639868734,TRUE,2,20,Low,sterile,isolated; culture; medium; sterile; pcr; ITS; microscopy; observed; light microscopy; studied; assessed,NA,"influenced by inoculation technique, post-inoculation time (7th, 14th, 21st and 28th dpi) and plant growth medium (sterile soil, non-sterile soil), recorded maximum on 14th-day post-inoculation (dpi) i.e., 96% in stems, 92% | Beauveria bassiana, a potential entomopathogenic biocontrol agent, has recently drawn attention worldwide for its other additional beneficial roles such as plant disease antagonist, beneficial rhizosphere colonizer, plant growth promoter | found best as compared to seed and root inoculation techniques, and maximum fungal recovery was observed in stems and leaves and least in roots.

17226,"First Report of Cercospora apii, Causal Agent of Cercospora Early Blight of Celery, in Serbia.","Celery (Apium graveolens var. dulce) is a very important vegetable crop intensively cultivated in eastern and southern Serbia. During a field survey in August and September 2012, we observed symptoms similar to those of Cercospora early blight in eastern Serbia, with some of the affected fields showing up to 80% disease severity. The lesions on leaves were amphigenous, subcircular to angular and more or less confluent. Lesions enlarged and merged with age, followed by the development of necrotic area causing a continuous deterioration of the plant. Conidiophores arising from the stromata formed dense fascicles, sometimes appearing solitary, brown at the base, paler toward the apex, simple, straight to slightly curved, and rarely geniculate (dimensions 40 to 90 × 5 to 8 μm). Conidia were solitary, hyaline, at first cylindro-obclavate then acicular to acicular-obclavate, straight to slightly curved, subacute to obtuse at the apex, while truncated and thickened at the base (dimensions 45 to 160 × 4 to 5 μm), 5 to 13 septate. Based on the morphological features, we identified the pathogen as Cercospora apii Fresen. (2). In order to obtain monosporic isolates of the fungus, single conidia were cultivated on potato dextrose agar (PDA). To confirm the pathogenicity of the isolates, 5 mm-diameter mycelial plugs from the PDA plates were placed upside down on the adaxial leaf surface of 2-week-old celery seedlings of cv. Yuta. Control plants were inoculated with a sterile PDA plug. Three leaves per plant were disinfected with 70% ethanol, epidermis was scratched with a sterile needle to promote the infection, and inoculated. A total of 12 plants were inoculated with the mycelial plugs and 12 were used as control plants. Inoculated and control plants were kept in a moist chamber for 48 h and then transferred to a greenhouse at 25 ± 2°C. After 2 weeks, the first necrotic spots appeared on inoculated leaves, similar to the symptoms manifested in the field, while control plants remained symptomless. The pathogen was re-isolated and its identity was verified based on morphological and molecular features. To confirm the pathogen's identity, three isolates (CAC4-1, CAC24, and CAC30) were subjected to molecular identification based on the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) using the ITS1/ITS4 universal primers (5), a partial calmodulin gene (CAL) using CAL-228F/CAL2Rd primers (1,4), and partial histone H3 gene (H3) using CYLH3F/CYLH3R primers (3). Sequences of the amplified regions were deposited in GenBank under accessions KJ210596 to KJ210604. The BLAST analyses of the ITS sequences revealed 100% identity with several Cercospora species (e.g., C. apii [JX143532], C. beticola [JX143556], and C. zebrina [KC172066]), while sequences of CAL and H3 showed 100% identity solely with sequences of C. apii (JX142794 and JX142548). Based on combined morphological and molecular data, the pathogen infecting celery was identified as C. apii, which to our knowledge represents the first report of the presence of the causal agent of Cercospora early blight disease in Serbia.

16787,First Report of Neofusicoccum parvum Associated with Stem Canker and Dieback of Asian Pear Trees in Taiwan.,"Asian pear tree (Pyrus pyrifolia) is an important fruit crop in Asian countries. Between the autumn of 2008 and the summer of 2009, stem cankers and twig diebacks of Asian pear trees were observed in middle Taiwan. Necrotic lesions extending from branch scars progressed with age, resulting in darkened vascular discoloration. Two cultivars of Asian pear, Taichung No. 2 grown in Changhwa County and Heng-shan grown in Taichung County, showed the same symptoms. Disease incidence increased rapidly after a rain or storm event, eventually exceeding 50%. Pycnidia on severely infected branches contained one-celled, fusiform to ellipsoidal, smooth- and thin-walled hyaline conidia, with an average length (L) and width (W) of 19.1 (11.3 to 24.8) × 5.9 (4.5 to 8.0) μm and a L/W ratio of 3.2 (n = 44). Diseased branch tissues collected from the two locations were surface sterilized in 0.6% NaOCl, rinsed with water, and plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Fungal isolates, recovered from both locations, produced white, aerial mycelium and became dull gray within a week after incubating plates at 25°C. To confirm the identities of the isolates, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions amplified with primers ITS1/ITS4 were deposited in GenBank (Accession Nos. GU395186 and GU395187). Both of the sequences were 99% identical to that of Neofusicoccum parvum (Accession No. EU882162) over a 534-bp alignment. Thus, both morphological and molecular characters confirmed this species as N. parvum (3), reported as the anamorph of Botryosphaeria parva (1). The two voucher isolates (BCRC34605 and BCRC34609) were deposited in Bioresource Collection and Research Center, Hsinchu, Taiwan. Pathogenicity tests were first conducted on 2-year-old greenhouse-potted Asian pear trees utilizing N. parvum isolate BCRC34605. Ten plants of the cv. Mi-li were stem wounded with a 5-mm cork borer at a depth of 2 mm. Inoculation consisted of inserting 5-mm mycelium plugs of the pathogen into the wounds and wrapping with Parafilm. Sterile PDA plugs applied to an equal number of plants with the same methods served as the controls. After 2 months incubation at an average temperature of 21°C, all inoculated plants exhibited necrotic lesions with a mean length of 23.5 mm and the control plants remained symptomless. The pathogen was reisolated from lesions of inoculated stems, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. Pathogenicity tests were repeated by inoculating the other N. parvum isolate (BCRC34609) on pear cv. Taichung No. 2, resulting in similar results. N. parvum has been reported causing dieback and canker in a wide range of fruit trees, including grapevine (4) and mango trees (2). To our knowledge, this is the first report of N. parvum associated with stem canker and dieback on Asian pear trees. In addition, this is a newly recorded species for the mycobiota of Taiwan.

17473,First Report of Phomopsis Seed Decay of Soybean Caused by Phomopsis longicolla in South China.,"Phomopsis seed decay of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) causes poor seed quality and suppresses yield in most soybean-growing areas in the world. The disease is caused primarily by Phomopsis longicolla Hobbs. During the spring of 2010, soybean seeds without symptoms were planted in the fields but emergence was poor and the emergence rates ranged from 30 to 70% in south China. Approximately 3,000 symptomless seeds were randomly collected from seven fields at three locations in Guangzhou, Nanchang, and Wuhan. Seeds were surface disinfected with 1% sodium hypochlorite for 12 min, rinsed in sterile distilled water three to four times, and placed on 2% agar. Plates were then incubated at 26°C under 16/8-h photoperiod for 3 to 4 days. About 10 to 20% of the seeds produced white hyphae that spread rapidly and covered the whole seed. The hyphae from fungal isolates were transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 26°C in the dark. After 3 to 4 weeks, conidia were elliptical with two oil drops at both ends and hyaline (6.2 to 7.2 × 2.6 to 3.2 μm). The cultural and morphological characteristics of the isolates corresponded with the description of P. longicolla (2). Colonies on PDA were floccose, dense, and white. Stromata were large, black, and spreading. To confirm the morphological identification, the ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) from three isolates were sequenced (GenBank Accession Nos. JQ899030, JQ899031, and JQ899032). BLAST analysis indicated that the isolates had 99% nucleotide sequence identity with P. longicolla (GenBank Accession Nos. AY857868.1, EF026104, and HQ130441.1). Pathogenicity tests were conducted on 2-week-old soybean seedlings (3). A mycelial plug (3 mm in diameter) from the margin of 1-week-old PDA culture of the Wuhan isolate was individually placed mycelial side down directly on the top of cut stem 1 to 2 cm above cotyledon node of the soybean seedling. PDA plugs without the fungus was used as the negative control. All seedlings were kept in a growth chamber at 26°C with 92 to 94% relative humidity. After 2 weeks, all inoculated seedlings showed browning, stem wilt, and the lesions were 0.3 to 2.0 cm long. No symptoms were observed in the control plants. P. longicolla was reisolated from the infected seedlings. The pathogenicity test was repeated three times. Soybean stem blight caused by P. longicolla has been reported in northeast China (1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. longicolla causing Phomopsis seed decay of soybean in south China. This report will establish a foundation for developing a program for screening germplasm for resistance to this disease in south China. References: (1) Y. L. Cui et al. Plant Pathol. 58:799, 2009.

17613,First Report of Phytophthora drechsleri Associated with Stem and Foliar Blight of Gynura bicolor in Taiwan.,"Gynura bicolor (Roxb. ex Willd.) DC., known as Okinawa spinach or hong-feng-cai, is a commonly consumed vegetable in Asian countries. In May 2010, plants with blight and wilt symptoms were observed in commercial vegetable farms in Changhua, Taiwan. Light brown-to-black blight lesions developed from the top of the stems to the petioles and extended to the base of the leaves. Severely infected plants declined and eventually died. Disease incidence was approximately 20%. Samples of symptomatic tissues were surface sterilized in 0.6% NaOCl and plated on water agar. A Phytophthora sp. was consistently isolated and further plated on 10% unclarified V8 juice agar, with daily radial growths of 7.6, 8.6, 5.7, and 2.4 mm at 25, 30, 35, and 37°C, respectively. Four replicates were measured for each temperature. No hyphal growth was observed at 39°C. Intercalary hyphal swellings and proliferating sporangia were produced in culture plates flooded with sterile distilled water. Sporangia were nonpapillate, obpyriform to ellipsoid, base tapered or rounded, and 43.3 (27.5 to 59.3) × 27.6 (18.5 to 36.3) μm. Clamydospores and oospores were not observed. Oospores were present in dual cultures with an isolate of P. nicotianae (p731) (1) A2 mating type, indicating that the isolate was heterothallic. A portion of the internal transcribed spacer sequence was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. HQ717146). The sequence was 99% identical to that of P. drechsleri SCRP232 (ATCC46724) (3), a type isolate of the species. The pathogen was identified as P. drechsleri Tucker based on temperature growth, morphological characteristics, and ITS sequence homology (3). To evaluate pathogenicity, the isolated P. drechsleri was inoculated on greenhouse-potted G. bicolor plants. Inoculum was obtained by grinding two dishes of the pathogen cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) with sterile distilled water in a blender. After filtering through a gauze layer, the filtrate was aliquoted to 240 ml. The inoculum (approximately 180 sporangia/ml) was sprayed on 24 plants of G. bicolor. An equal number of plants treated with sterile PDA processed in the same way served as controls. After 1 week, incubation at an average temperature of 29°C, blight and wilt symptoms similar to those observed in the fields appeared on 12 inoculated plants. The pathogen was reisolated from the lesions of diseased stems and leaves, fulfilling Koch's postulates. The controls remained symptomless. The pathogenicity test was repeated once with similar results. G. bicolor in Taiwan has been recorded to be infected by P. cryptogea (1,2), a species that resembles P. drechsleri. The recorded isolates of P. cryptogea did not have a maximal growth temperature at or above 35°C (1,2), a distinctive characteristic to discriminate between the two species (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. drechsleri being associated with stem and foliar blight of G. bicolor. References: (1) P. J. Ann. Plant Pathol. Bull. 5:146, 1996. (2) H. H. Ho et al.

16780,Occurrences of Diplodia Leaf Streak Caused by Stenocarpella macrospora on Corn (Zea mays) in Illinois.,"In August 2008, long and narrow lesions were observed on leaves of corn (Zea mays L.) growing in a field in Pope County, Illinois. Lesions were 10 to 35 × 50 to 250 mm and were cream to tan. Dark pycnidia inside the lesions were immersed and approximately 350 μm in diameter. Affected leaves were collected and placed into a moist chamber to encourage the development of conidia. Conidia developed in cirri and were dark, one septate, and 7 to 11 × 59 to 87 μm. Cirri were streaked onto potato dextrose agar (PDA; Becton, Dickinson, and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and cultures arising from single conidia were transferred and maintained. On the basis of the corn leaf symptoms and the morphological characteristics of the pycnidia and conidia, the fungus was tentatively identified as Stenocarpella macrospora (Earle) Sutton (1). To complete Koch's postulates, 'Garst 84H80-3000GT' corn was inoculated in the greenhouse. Conidia were produced by placing a S. macrospora isolate from Pope County, IL onto water agar containing autoclaved corn leaves and incubating at room temperature until pycnidia and conidia were produced (approximately 3 weeks). A conidial suspension was used to inoculate the leaf whorls of corn plants (approximately at the V4 growth stage). Control plants were mock inoculated with sterile water. The experiment was repeated once over time. Twenty days after inoculation, all plants inoculated with S. macrospora conidia developed lesions similar to those observed in the field, and mock-inoculated plants remained symptomless. The fungus was reisolated on PDA from the symptomatic leaves. In August 2009, symptomatic leaves similar to those observed in Pope County, IL in 2008 were observed and collected from corn fields in Gallatin and Vermillion counties. Pycnidia and conidia from these lesions were similar to those described above, and isolates from single conidia were obtained from these samples. To confirm the identity of all isolates collected, PCR amplification of the small subunit rDNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region with primers EF3RCNL and ITS4 was conducted (3). The PCR product was sequenced with these primers at the Keck Biotechnology Center at the University of Illinois, Urbana. The resulting nucleotide sequence was compared with small subunit rDNA and ITS sequences deposited in the GenBank nucleotide database, which revealed 99% homology to sequences of S. macrospora. In total, six of our S. macrospora isolates from Gallatin, Pope, and Vermillion counties were submitted to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agriculture Research Service Culture Collection in Peoria, IL, where they have received NRRL Accession Nos. 54190-54195. To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. macrospora affecting corn in Illinois. Although not observed in the Illinois corn fields described above, S. macrospora has been reported to infect stalks and ears (2). Because of the large leaf lesions caused by S. macrospora and its reported aggressiveness in causing disease on leaves, ears, and stalks, this pathogen has the potential to cause severe yield and quality losses to corn in the United States (2).

17650,First Report of Penicillium griseofulvum Causing Blue Mold on Stored Apples in Italy (Piedmont).,"In northern Italy, blue mold can occur generally on apples after 3 months of storage under controlled atmospheres. The mold can be caused by Penicillium griseofulvum Dierckx (synonym P. urticae Bainier). During 2008, several postharvest fruit rots were observed on apples (cv. Golden Delicious) after 180 to 240 days of storage at 1°C. Approximately 8% of the fruits showed blue mold. Apples had been cultivated in Aosta (Aosta Valley Region) and Lagnasco (Piedmont Region). Infected fruits showed soft, watery, brown spots enlarging rapidly at 20°C. There was a distinct margin between soft rotted flesh and firm healthy tissues. Under high humidity, masses of blue-green spores formed on the surface of the lesion. Apple fruit excisions from the margin between the healthy and diseased tissues were plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA), pH 5.6. The recovered fungus produced abundant mycelium and conidia, with the colonies attaining a diameter of 2.0 to 2.4 cm after 7 days at 20 ± 2°C on PDA. Colonies were mostly yellow-green, with a yellowish-to-orange brown underside. Conidiophores were mononematous or loosely synnematous, hyaline, with branches strongly divergent. Phialides were cylindrical with a very short neck. Conidia were ellipsoidal, sometimes subglobose, 2.5 to 3.5 × 2.2 to 2.5 μm, hyaline to greenish. Preliminary morphological identification of the fungus (2) was confirmed by PCR using genomic DNA extracted from mycelia of pure cultures. Two sequences, obtained through the amplification of ribosomal region ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (1), were blast searched in GenBank and showed 99% sequence coverage and 99% similarity to ribosomal sequences of P. griseofulvum. Two sequences were deposited in GenBank with Accession Nos. HQ012498 (a strain from Aosta Valley) and HQ012499 (a strain from the Piedmont Region). Pathogenicity was tested on 20 ripe fruits each of four apple cultivars (Golden Delicious, Red Chief, Granny Smith, and Royal Gala). Fruits were surface sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite. Conidial suspensions (30 μl of 105 conidia/ml) of the fungus were placed on artificial wounds generated on the apple surface. Control fruits were treated with sterile water. Seven days after inoculation, the symptoms were reproduced on the four cultivars and P. griseofulvum was reisolated on PDA from the inoculated fruits of all four cultivars. Control fruits were symptomless. An analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array of the rotting tissues associated with inoculated fruits of all four cultivars (4) confirmed, as in the case of other strains of P. griseofulvum, the production of the mycotoxin patulin (12.1 to 44.4 mg kg-1). Previously, P. griseofulvum was reported on apple in other countries such as the United States (3), Japan, Egypt, and Brazil. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. griseofulvum on apples during storage in Italy. References: (1) R. Nilsson et al. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 296:97, 2009. (2) R. A. Samson and J. L. Pitt.

17178,First Report of Strawberry Dieback Caused by Lasiodiplodia theobromae.,"With a typical Mediterranean climate, Aydin is the third largest strawberry-producing province, responsible for 13% of the overall strawberry production in Turkey. Strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne) are mainly grown in raised, plastic-mulched beds under tunnels and soil solarization is the most effectively used management practice to control soil-borne pathogens. During October 2011 and 2012, 2 months after planting, wilting and collapse of plants were observed on commercial strawberry (cv. strawberry Festival) fields in Sultanhisar town of Aydin Province. Eleven percent of the plants were wilted and died. Symptomatic plants exhibited blackened necrotic discoloration of roots and in the cross section of crowns. A fungus was consistently isolated from pieces of infected tissue cut aseptically from the crowns and placed on potato dextrose agar. Fungus produced white colonies and later turned olivaecious black with dense aerial mycelium after 4 to 5 days incubation at 27°C. Dark brown to black pycnidia that formed on 20- to 30-day-old pure cultures under daylight conditions produced abundant conidia that were two-celled, thick-walled, and oval shaped with longitudinal striations. Single spore isolates from 12 samples were obtained and stored for further identification. The average size of 300 conidia was 25.42 ± 2.12 × 12.87 ± 1.08 μm. The morphology of the fungus was similar to Lasiodiplodia theobromae (Pat.) Griff. & Maubl. (syn. Botryodiplodia theobromae Pat.). To confirm the identity of the isolates, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA and the elongation factor 1-alpha gene were amplified with the universal ITS1/ITS4 and EF1-688F/EF1-1251R (1) primers, respectively. The amplicons from 12 isolates were commercially sequenced at Macrogen (Korea) and were deposited in GenBank under consecutive accession numbers KF910369 to KF910380 and KJ641536 to KJ641547. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed that all 12 isolates were closely related and belonged to L. theobromae. Pathogenicity tests were performed by the toothpick technique (2) under greenhouse conditions (28°C, 14/10-h day/night, 70% RH) on potted strawberry plants (cv. strawberry Festival). Toothpicks carrying fungal growth taken from 1-week-old corn meal agar cultures of the tested isolates was placed into the basal crown tissue of the plants by piercing about 5 mm depth. Six plants were inoculated for each isolate and six were treated with sterile toothpick for control. All inoculated plants developed wilting and dieback symptoms resembling those of naturally infected plants within 2 to 3 weeks of incubation. All plants inoculated with the tested isolates collapsed after 4 weeks and showed discoloration of internal crown tissue. Control plants did not exhibit any disease symptoms, and crown tissue was symptomless. L. theobromae was successfully re-isolated from lesions of all inoculated plants. L. theobromae has been reported to cause cankers and dieback in a wide range of hosts in tropical and subtropical regions of the world (3). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of L. theobromae causing dieback on strawberry plants. References: (1) A. Alves et al. Fungal Divers. 28:1, 2008. (2) M. E. A. El-Morsi and I.

16950,"Basal Rot of Hylocereus undatus Caused by Fusarium oxysporum in Buenos Aires, Argentina.","Night-blooming cereus (Hylocereus undatus A. Berger) is generally used as rootstock of ornamental cactus because of its rapid growth and tolerance to humid substrates. Since 2002, in Gran Buenos Aires, a new disease has been observed in grafted crops in all production stages. Incidence was as much as 30% in many greenhouses. Symptoms consisted of soft rot that started near the soil line and developed upward until it affected all the rootstock. The scion was not rotten, but died as a consequence of rootstock infection. All the roots were symptomless. For pathogen isolation, symptomatic tissues were surface disinfected by a 1-min immersion in 0.2% NaOCl, placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at 22 ± 2°C. Only a Fusarium spp. was consistently isolated in pure culture. Twenty healthy potted night-blooming cereus plants, 10 of them previously injured with needles on the rootstock near the soil line, were gently removed from the substrate and inoculated by a 1-min immersion of their base in a suspension of 1.4 × 106 conidia per ml of sterile distilled water, prepared from 15-day-old cultures. Ten control plants, five of them previously injured, were immersed in sterile distilled water. Inoculated and noninoculated plants were replanted in the original substrate, placed in a climatic chamber at 22 ± 2°C, and monitored for disease expression. Basal rot was observed on all injured inoculated plants 12 days after inoculation. Symptoms on undamaged plants appeared 22 days after inoculation. After 72 days of incubation, all inoculated plants were totally rotten. Control plants remained symptomless. The same pathogen was reisolated to fulfill Koch's postulates. For species identification, single-spore cultures were grown on PDA and carnation leaf agar in a climatic chamber at 23 ± 2°C with a 12-h darkness/near ultraviolet light regimen. The micromorphology and culture features, mainly conidial ontogeny, were consistent with descriptions of Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtend.:Fr. (1). The pathogen was able to penetrate undamaged tissues. Needle injuries accelerated infection. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Fusarium oxysporum on H. undatus in Gran Buenos Aires, Argentina.

17215,First Report of Colletotrichum clavatum Causing Quince Anthracnose in Serbia.,"Quince (Cydonia oblonga Mill.) tree is traditionally grown in Serbia. The fruits are used for compote, marmalade, and brandy production. In December 2012, quince fruits cv. Leskovacka with symptoms of postharvest anthracnose were collected in a storage facility in the area of Sabac, western Serbia. The symptoms were observed on fruits approximately 2 months after harvest. The incidence of the disease was about 3%, but the symptoms were severe. Affected fruits showed sunken, dark brown to black lesions with orange conidial masses produced in black acervuli. Small pieces (3 to 5 mm) of necrotic tissue were surface sterilized for 1 min in 1% NaOCl, washed twice with sterile distilled water, and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Macroscopic and microscopic morphology characteristics of three isolates were observed after growth on PDA for 7 days at 25°C under a 12-h photoperiod. Fungal colonies developed white to gray dense aerial mycelium with orange conidial masses in the center of the colony. Conidia were hyaline, aseptate, clavate with rounded distal apices, 15.2 (12.8 to 16.8) × 4.5 (4.0 to 5.2) μm (mean L/W ratio = 3.3, n = 100). Morphological characteristics are consistent with the description of Colletotrichum clavatum (2). Fungal isolates were also characterized by sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA region using ITS1/IT4 primers and β-tubuline 2 gene using T1/T2 primers. The nucleotide sequences were deposited in GenBank (ITS Accession Nos. KF908866, KF908867, and KF908868; β-tubuline 2 gene KF908869, KF908870, and KF908871). BLAST analyses of ITS and β-tubuline 2 gene sequences showed that isolates from quince were 100% identical to other C. clavatum in GenBank (ITS JN121126, JN121130, JN121132, and JN121180; β-tubuline 2 gene JN121213 to 17, JN121219, JN121228, JN121261 to 62, and JN121266 to 69), thus confirming the morphological identification. To fulfill Koch's postulates, asymptomatic fruits of quince cv. Leskovacka (five fruits per isolate) were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol, wounded with a sterile needle, and inoculated with 50 μl of a spore suspension (1 × 106 conidia/ml). Five control fruits were inoculated with 50 μl of sterile distilled water. The experiment was repeated twice. After 10 days of incubation in plastic containers, under high humidity (>90% RH) at 25°C, typical anthracnose symptoms developed on inoculated fruits, while control fruits remained symptomless. The isolates recovered from symptomatic fruits showed the same morphological features as original isolates. C. clavatum previously indicated as group B (3), or genetic group A4 within the C. acutatum sensu lato complex (4), is responsible for olive anthracnose in some Mediterranean countries (1,2), and has been reported as causal agent of anthracnose on a wide range of other hosts including woody and herbaceous plants, ornamentals, and fruit trees worldwide (4). To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. clavatum in Serbia, and the first report of quince anthracnose caused by this pathogen in Europe. Anthracnose caused by C. clavatum can endanger the production and storage of quince in the future, and may require investigation of new disease management practices to control this fungus.

4999,"Methylobacterium, a major component of the culturable bacterial endophyte community of wild Brassica seed","Background: Plants are commonly colonized by a wide diversity of microbial species and the relationships created can range from mutnalistic through to parasitic. Microorganisms that typically form symptomless associations with internal plant tissues are termed endophytes. Endophytes associate with most plant species found in natural and managed ecosystems. They are extremely important plant partners that provide improved stress tolerance to the host compared with plants that lack this symbiosis. Plant domestication has reduced endophyte diversity and therefore the wild relatives of many crop species remain untapped reservoirs of beneficial microbes. Brassica species display immense diversity and consequently provide the greatest assortment of products used by humans from a single plant genus important for agriculture, horticulture, bioremediation, medicine, soil conditioners, composting crops, and in the production of edible and industrial oils. Many endophytes are horizontally transmitted, but some can colonize the plant's reproductive tissues, and this gives these symbionts an efficient mechanism of propagation via plant seed (termed vertical transmission). Methods: This study surveyed 83 wild and landrace Brassica accessions composed of 14 different species with a worldwide distribution for seed-originating bacterial endophytes. Seed was stringently disinfected, sown within sterile tissue culture pots within a sterile environment and incubated. After approximately 1-month, direct isolation techniques were used to recover bacterial endophytes from roots and shoots of symptomless plants. Bacteria were identified based on the PCR amplification of partial 16S rDNA gene sequences and annotated using the BLASTn program against the NCBI rRNA database. A diversity index was used as a quantitative measure to reflect how many different bacterial species there were in the seed-originating microbial community of the Brassica accessions sampled. Results: Bacterial endophytes were recovered from the majority of the Brassica accessions screened. 16S rDNA gene sequencing identified 19 different bacterial species belonging to three phyla, namely Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria with the most frequently isolated species being Methylobacterium fujisawaense, Stenotrophomonas rhizophila and Pseudomonas lactis. Methylobacterium was the dominant genus composing 56% of the culturable isolated bacterial community and was common in 77% of accessions possessing culturable bacterial endophytes. Two selected isolates of Methylobacterium significantly promoted plant growth when inoculated into a cultivar of oilseed rape and inhibited the growth of the pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans in dual culture. This is the first report that investigates the seed-originating endophytic microorganisms of wild Brassica species and highlights the Brassica microbiome as a resource for plant growth promoting bacteria and biological control agents.","Roodi, D; Millner, JP; McGill, C; Johnson, RD; Jauregui, R; Card, SD",PEERJ,2020,10.7717/peerj.9514,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.778612828580968,TRUE,2,19,Low,sterile,isolated; isolation; culture; incubated; sterile; pcr; rrna; sequencing; screened; surveyed; sampled,"species with a worldwide distribution for seed-originating bacterial endophytes.

17589,First Report of Sclerotinia Blight Caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum on Fan Columbine (Aquilegia flabellata) in Italy.,"Fan columbine is a perennial garden species belonging to the family Ranunculaceae. During the spring of 2011, extensive wilting was observed on 5-month-old potted plants of Aquilegia flabellata grown in an experimental glasshouse belonging to the Center AGROINNOVA at Grugliasco (northern Italy). First symptoms included stem necrosis and darkening and withering of leaves. Plant wilt occurred a few days after the appearance of the first symptoms. Infected plants were characterized by the presence of soft, watery tissues. In the presence of high relative humidity, lesions became covered with a whitish mycelium and irregular, dark gray sclerotia (1.5 to 4.0 × 1.0 to 2.8, average 2.8 × 2.1 mm) were produced on the mycelium. Diseased tissue was surface sterilized for 1 min in 1% NaOCl and plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with 100 mg/l of streptomycin sulfate. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary (2) was consistently recovered from infected stem pieces. Sclerotia produced on PDA measured 2.0 to 7.0 × 2.0 to 5.0 (average 4.2 × 2.9) mm. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified using the primers ITS1F/ITS4 and sequenced. BLAST analysis (1) of the 575-bp segment showed a 100% homology with the sequence of S. sclerotiorum (EF091809). The nucleotide sequence has been assigned the GenBank Accession No. JN013184. Pathogenicity of one isolate obtained from sclerotia of infected plants was confirmed by inoculating three 6-month-old plants transplanted in 16-cm-diameter pots in a glasshouse in a sphagnum peat/pomix/pine bark/clay (50:20:20:10) mix. Inoculum that consisted of 3 g/l of substrate of sterile wheat kernels infested with mycelium and sclerotia was placed in the soil and around the base of each plant. Three noninoculated plants served as controls. Plants were maintained in a growth chamber at 21 ± 1°C and relative humidity >90%. The inoculation trial was carried out twice. All inoculated plants developed leaf yellowing within 15 days of soil infestation. White, cottony mycelium and dark sclerotia developed on stems and at the base of all inoculated plants. Eventually, infected plants wilted. Control plants remained symptomless. S. sclerotiorum was reisolated from the stems of inoculated plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. sclerotiorum on A. flabellata in Italy. The disease has been previously reported on A. vulgaris in the United States (3) and A. glandulosa in Russia (4). The economic importance of this disease in Italy is currently limited.

17388,First Report of Leaf Spot Caused by Corynespora cassiicola on Rose of Sharon in Korea.,"Rose of Sharon, Hibiscus syriacus L., is a flowering shrub in the family Malvaceae planted as the national flower of South Korea. In September 2012, previously unknown leaf spots with premature defoliation were observed on dozens of Rose of Sharon plants growing in the shaded area in a park of Dongducheon, Korea. The same symptoms were found on Rose of Sharon in several localities of Korea in 2012. The symptoms usually started as small, dark brown to grayish leaf spots, eventually causing leaf yellowing with significant premature defoliation. The diseased leaves retained for a while green color at the margin of the spots. Representative samples (n = 5) were deposited in the Korea University Herbarium (KUS). Conidiophores of the fungus observed microscopically on the leaf spots were erect, brown to dark brown, single or in clusters, amphigenous but mostly hypophyllous, and measured 80 to 400 × 5 to 10 μm. Conidia were borne singly or in short chains, ranging from cylindrical to broadest at the base and tapering apically, straight to slightly curved, pale olivaceous brown, 2 to 16 pseudoseptate, 50 to 260 × 9 to 20 μm, each with a conspicuous thickened hilum. On potato dextrose agar, single-spore cultures of two isolates were identified as Corynespora cassiicola (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) C.T. Wei on the basis of morphological and cultural characteristics (1,2). Two monoconidial isolates were preserved at the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection (KACC46956 and KACC46957). Genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini DNA Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified with the primers ITS1/ITS4 and sequenced. The resulting sequences of 520 bp were deposited in GenBank (Accession Nos. KC193256, KC193257). A BLAST search in GenBank revealed that the sequences showed 100% identity with those of numerous C. cassiicola isolates from diverse substrates. To conduct a pathogenicity test, a conidial suspension (ca. 2 × 104 conidia/ml) was prepared in sterile water by harvesting conidia from 2-week-old cultures of KACC46956, and the suspension was sprayed onto the leaves of three healthy 2-year-old plants. Inoculated plants were kept in humid chambers for the first 48 h and thereafter placed in the glasshouse. After 10 days, typical leaf spot symptoms developed on the leaves of all three inoculated plants. C. cassiicola was reisolated from the lesions, confirming Koch's postulates. Control plants treated with sterile water remained symptomless. C. cassiicola is cosmopolitan with a very wide host range (1,2). Though Corynespora hibisci Goto was recorded to be associated with brown spot disease of H. syriacus in Japan (4), there is no previous record of C. cassiicola on H. syriacus (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of Corynespora leaf spot on Rose of Sharon in Korea. According to our field observations in Korea, this disease was found in August and September, following a prolonged period of moist weather. Severe infection resulted in leaf yellowing and premature defoliation, reducing tree vigor and detracting the beauty of green leaves. References: (1) L. J. Dixon et al. Phytopathology 99:1015, 2009.

16815,First Report of Dollar Spot of Seashore Paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum) Caused by Sclerotinia homoeocarpa in South China.,"Seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum Swartz), a warm-season perennial grass, is native to tropical and subtropical regions of North and South America (1). Its fine texture and tolerance to low mowing and hypersaline environments make it a commercially promising turfgrass species for coastal regions of south China. In late March 2009, disease symptoms were observed from two golf course fairways in Shenzhen and Foshan, Guangdong Province, China. Small, round patches from 25 to 75 mm in diameter were found to be consisting of bleached, straw color leaf lesions bounded by reddish brown margins. Similar patches had previously been observed on seashore paspalum since 1997 in Guangdong Province, but this turf species has been grown in southern China only since the early 1990s. These symptoms were observed when daytime temperatures were above 25°C and with heavy dew formation at night. Greatest severity was seen in the spring and fall. Several contact and systemic fungicides were applied after first symptoms were observed and they were usually successful in suppressing disease. To confirm the disease as dollar spot, isolates from Shenzhen and Foshan were obtained by plating diseased leaf blades of P. vaginatum (cv. Salam) on potato dextrose agar media. Isolates produced white, fluffy, aerial mycelium, columnar when mature, and usually with a cinnamon base and dark brown or black substratal stroma on and in the agar. One representative isolate from each location was chosen for pathogenicity testing. Six-week-old P. vaginatum (cv. Salam) grown from seed in pots was inoculated, with 5-mm-diameter agar plugs with hyphae from 5-day-old cultures, by direct placement onto leaves and with three replicate pots per isolate. Plants treated with sterile agar plugs served as controls. Inoculated turf was incubated at 25°C with 12-h light/dark conditions. A plastic film was also placed over the pots to retain moisture. Chlorotic leaf lesions started to develop 4 days after inoculation and became a bleached straw color. The same fluffy, white fungus was reisolated from lesions, while no disease was observed on controls, thus completing Koch's postulates. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA was amplified from DNA extracted from two isolates using primers ITS5 and ITS4 (2), and the 610-bp sequences showed 98% similarity with Sclerotinia homoeocarpa F.T. Bennett in GenBank and have been deposited as Accessions GQ386985 and GU002301. Dollar spot on P. vaginatum has been commonly observed in the United States (1). To our knowledge, this is the first confirmed report of dollar spot on P. vaginatum in China or from any host plant in China. References: (1) R. R. Duncan and R. N. Carrow.

7753,"Diversity of Endophytic Fungi and Bacteria Inhabiting the Roots of the Woodland Grass, Festuca gigantea (Poaceae)","We studied the occurrence of endophytic fungi and bacteria in the roots of F. gigantea, a woodland perennial grass common throughout Europe and temperate Asia. The taxonomic assignment was carried out according to the isolate's colony and cytological species morphotype characteristics and confirmed by the assessment of the standard DNA sequences, ITS, RPB2, SSU, and TEF1-a for fungi and 16S rDNA for bacteria. Our study has shown that F. gigantea roots are the habitat to a wide range of fungi and bacteria. The occurrence of fungal structures was determined in similar to 40% of the roots examined by Trypan Blue staining. In a surface-sterile root-cutting culture on PDA medium, we obtained isolates of six endophytic fungi species: four members of Ascomycota-Alternaria alternata, Cadophora fastigiata, Chaetomium funicola, andMicrodochium bolleyi-and two of Basidiomycota-Coprinellus sp. and Sistotrema brinkmannii. In addition, we report bacteria co-occurring endophytically in the roots of this grass. The Firmicutes group was the most prevalent, consisting of four Gram-positive, endospore-forming bacteria taxa. The isolates were identified as Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus sp., Lysinibacillus sp., and Priestia aryabhattai. Moreover, two Gram-negative bacteria were detected-Kosakonia sp. (Proteobacteria) and Pedobacter sp. (Bacteroidetes). Thus, applying the isolate-culture approach, we identified a set of microorganisms in the roots of a typical grass native to the deciduous forest floor. The functional roles of these endophytes are diverse, and many of them, saprotrophs and decomposers of wood and plant debris, are linked to the decomposition of organic matter. This is the first detailed report on fungal and bacterial endophytes inhabiting the roots of F. gigantea. This study fills in a research gap on endophytes associated with the below-ground parts of Festuca spp., hitherto extensively studied for Epichloe/Neotyphodium associations in their foliar parts.","Pasakinskiene, I; Stakeliene, V; Matijosiute, S; Martunas, J",DIVERSITY-BASEL,2024,10.3390/d16080453,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.905568647629641,TRUE,2,18,Low,sterile,culture; medium; colony; sterile; PDA; ITS; examined; trypan blue; examined; studied,NA,"similar to 40% of the roots examined by Trypan Blue staining.

17150,First Report of Phytophthora megasperma Causing Decline and Death on Celtis australis in Italy.,"European hackberry (Celtis australis L.) is a popular shade tree mainly planted in southern Europe and known to be tolerant to dry and poor soils. In early autumn 2013, hackberry plants grown in soil in a commercial nursery located in the floodplain in Umbria region showed symptoms of wilting, dieback, and death. Up to 100% of the canopy was affected, and over 60% of the plants were symptomatic or dead. A Phytophthora species was consistently isolated from symptomatic 6-year-old plants by plating small pieces of collar and root tissues, cut from the margin of dark-brown necrotic lesions, onto P5ARPH selective medium (4). Pure cultures were obtained by single-hyphal transfers on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Sporangia, produced on pepper seeds in soil extract solution (3), were nonpapillate and noncaducous, measuring 34.0 to 85.0 × 22.0 to 50.0 μm. Oospores had an average diameter of 44 μm with mostly paragynous antheridia. On the basis of morphological features, the isolates were identified as P. megasperma Drech. (2). The identity was confirmed by sequencing the cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (Cox II) (5), which gave 100% identity with P. megasperma sequences available in GenBank (GU222070), and by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) using the universal primers ITS4 and ITS6, which gave 99% identity with the AF266794 sequence from Cooke et al. (1). The sequences of one isolate (AB239) were deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) with accession numbers HG973451 and HG973450 for Cox II and ITS, respectively. Pathogenicity tests were conducted in the greenhouse with isolate AB239 on eight 2-year-old potted European hackberry plants. Mycelial plugs (5 mm diameter) cut from the margins of actively growing 8-day-old cultures on PDA were inserted through the epidermis to the phloem at the collar level. Two plants were used as controls and treated as described above except that sterile PDA plugs replaced the inoculum. Inoculated plants were kept for 4 weeks in a greenhouse at 24 ± 2°C. During that period, inoculated plants showed wilting symptoms similar to those observed in the field. Lesions were evident at all the inoculation points progressing downward to the roots. Colonies of Phytophthora were isolated from the margins of lesions and identified as P. megasperma, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. Controls remained symptomless. P. megasperma taxonomy is rather complex since it embraces different subgroups, including host specialized forms (formae speciales), some of which are recognized as biological species. Based on morphological and molecular data presented here, the Phytophthora isolates from hackberry belong to P. megasperma sensu stricto, which is included in the ""pathogenic to a broad range of hosts"" (BHR) group (1). This pathogen is rather polyphagous, attacking mainly fruit and ornamental woody plants, commonly Prunus spp., Malus spp., and Actinidia deliciosa. Like other homothallic Phytophthora species, it is particularly dangerous due to its abundant production of thick-walled resting oospores that enable long-term survival in the soil. To our knowledge this is the first report of P. megasperma sensu stricto (1) on C. australis and its family Ulmaceae/Cannabaceae. References: (1) D. E. L. Cooke et al. Fungal Genet.

16990,First Report of Bacterial Leaf Spot of Italian Dandelion (Cichorium intybus) Caused by a Pseudomonas syringae Pathovar in California.,"Italian dandelion (Cichorium intybus) is a leafy, nonhead forming chicory plant that is eaten as a fresh vegetable in salads. During the late summer (August through October) of 2002, in the Salinas Valley (Monterey County) in California, a previously unreported disease was found in commercial Italian dandelion fields. Early symptoms were angular, vein delimited, dark, water-soaked leaf spots that measured 2 to 7 mm in diameter. As disease developed, spots retained angular edges but exhibited various irregular shapes. Spots commonly formed along the edges of the leaves; in some cases these spots developed into lesions that measured between 10 and 30 mm long. Spots were visible from adaxial and abaxial sides and were dull black in color. A cream-colored pseudomonad was consistently isolated from leaf spots that were macerated and streaked onto sucrose peptone agar. Fungi were not recovered from any of the spots. Recovered strains were blue-green fluorescent when streaked onto King's medium B agar. Bacterial strains were levan positive, oxidase negative, and arginine dihydrolase negative. Strains did not rot potato slices but induced a hypersensitive reaction on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Turk). These data indicated that the bacteria belonged to LOPAT group 1 of Pseudomonas syringae (1). Pathogenicity of six strains was tested by growing inoculum in nutrient broth shake cultures for 48 h, diluting to 106 CFU/ml, and spraying onto 12 6-week-old plants of Italian dandelion cv. Catalogna Special. Untreated control plants were sprayed with sterile nutrient broth. After 10 to 12 days in a greenhouse (24 to 26°C), leaf spots similar to those observed in the field developed on all inoculated plants. Strains were reisolated from the spots and identified as P. syringae. Control plants remained symptomless. These inoculation experiments were done twice and the results were the same. Amplification of repetitive bacterial sequences (repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction [rep-PCR]) demonstrated that all Italian dandelion strains had the same rep-PCR fingerprint, which differed from fingerprints of P. syringae pv. tagetis and P. syringae pv. tabaci. Additionally, toxin specific primers did not amplify tagetitoxin or tabtoxin biosynthesis genes from Italian dandelion strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bacterial leaf spot of commercially grown Italian dandelion in California caused by a P. syringae pathovar. Because fields were irrigated with overhead sprinklers, the disease was severe in several fields and as much as 30% of those plantings were not harvested. Reference: (1) R. A. Lelliott et al. J.

17629,First Report of Cane Blight on Blackberry Caused by Diaporthe eres in Croatia.,"A cane disease of blackberry (Rubus sp.) cv. Thornfree was observed in May and June 2010 in two growing regions in the eastern part of Slavonia in Croatia. Symptoms consisted of bleached areas between and around cane nodes with some canes showing wilt symptoms. Infected areas were covered with numerous, black pycnidia immersed in the epidermal tissue. Disease occurrence in orchards growing cv. Thornfree ranged between 1 and 15%. Thirty disease samples were collected, disinfected (1 min in 70% ethanol and 2 min in 1% NaOCl), and placed in a moist chamber for 4 days. Fungal sporulating structures were then picked off and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Fungal isolates obtained were identified as a Phomopsis sp., the conidial state of Diaporthe (3), on the basis of cultural and morphological characteristics. Alpha conidia were unicellular, hyaline, fusiform, sometimes tapering toward one or both ends, biguttulate (sometimes with several guttules), and 5.2 to 9.7 × 1.4 to 2.7 μm (average 6.5 × 2.1 μm). Beta conidia were hyaline, aseptate, filiform, hamate, and 16.6 to 28.2 × 0.5 to 1.5 μm (average 24.0 × 1.1 μm). The teleomorph was not observed. Biomolecular analysis was performed to identify the fungal species by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region spanning ITS 1, 5.8S rDNA, and ITS 2 of two isolates (Phk1 and Phk2). The amplified product was sequenced (GenLab-Enea, Rome, Italy) and a BLAST search of the NCBI nucleotide database was performed. Sequences from Phk1 and Phk2 (GenBank Accession Nos. HQ533144 and HQ533143, respectively) were identical to authentic and vouchered Diaporthe eres Nitschke (GenBank DQ491514, BPI 748435, and CBS 109767) ITS sequences in GenBank. Fungal isolates for pathogenicity tests were grown on PDA at 25°C for 7 days (12 h light/dark regimen). Inoculations were made on 30 to 40 cm long green shoots of potted plants of the blackberry cv. Thornfree. One-centimeter long wounds were made with a sterile scalpel and mycelia of D. eres were placed in the wounds. Inoculation sites were covered with a piece of wet cotton wool and aluminum foil to retain moisture. Three replications of 10 plants each were inoculated and these plus 10 control plants (inoculated with plugs of PDA only) were maintained in a growth chamber at 25°C. After 25 days, lesions developed on all 30 inoculated plants that averaged 15 mm long and control plants remained symptomless. D. eres was reisolated from inoculated plants, thus completing Koch's postulates. Phomopsis spp. have previously been reported on blackberry canes in Serbia (1) and Yugoslavia (2,4), however, to our knowledge, this is the first report of the occurrence of D. eres (anamorph P. oblonga) on blackberry in Croatia.

16744,First Report of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lentis of Lentil in Italy.,"During June and July 1999-2000, a disease causing severe losses of seedlings of a local ecotype of lentil (Lens culinaria Medik, syn. Lens esculenta Moench.) was observed in four commercial fields in central Italy (Umbria and Latium regions). Disease symptoms, observed in both years, included stunting, wilting, marked reduction of root system, and internal vascular discoloration of the lower stem. Twenty-five samples for each field, consisting of lentil roots and stems, were collected. Seven to eight tissue pieces per sample, derived from the lower stem and a variety of root sizes, were sampled, surface-treated in 1 or 0.1% HgCl2 for 30 s, rinsed in sterile deionized water, placed on petri dishes containing potato dextrose agar (PDA, pH 5.5) and then incubated for 7 days at 25°C. F. oxysporum (2) (identification confirmed by R. A. Samson, Centraalbureau Voor Schimmelcultures of Baarn, Netherlands) was consistently recovered from affected tissues. Monoconidial cultures of four isolates were prepared and evaluated for pathogenicity. Seventy 4-week-old lentil seedlings (local ecotype) were inoculated by dipping the root system of each seedling in a spore suspension of each isolate of F. oxysporum (106 conidia/ml) for 30 min and transplanted into a pot containing a sterilized sandy-loam soil mix. In a second experiment, 100 seeds for each isolate were sown in the same soil mix amended with rice kernels colonized with four isolates of F. oxysporum (10% wt/wt). Seedlings dipped in sterile deionized water and seeds sown in soil amended with noncolonized rice kernels served as controls in the first and second experiments, respectively. Three replications of both pathogenicity tests were carried out in a controlled growth chamber at day/night 22/20 ± 2°C, 60/70% RH, 12 h day (180 μE•m2•s-1). Both experiments were repeated. Two to three weeks after inoculation, all plants inoculated with each F. oxysporum isolate showed the same symptoms observed in the field and caused wilting and death of 80 to 100% of the inoculated plants. F. oxysporum was consistently reisolated from the symptomatic test plants, whereas the fungus was never isolated from all control plants which remained symptomless and healthy. F. oxysporum was not observed in seed health tests (blotter and agar plate methods) carried out on 100 seeds per sample harvested from infected crops. Management practices include long-term crop rotation with nonsusceptible hosts and removal and destruction of infected crop debris. Seed treatment with fungicides (benzimidazoles, thiram) (3) can reduce incidence of the disease but host resistance is the best mean of controlling Fusarium wilt. Most resistant lentil accessions come from Chile, Egypt, India, Iran, and Romania (1). This is the first report of F. oxysporum f. sp. lentis on lentil in Italy. Without adequate control, this seedling disease may become a major factor limiting production of high quality lentils in Umbria and Latium. References: (1) B. Baya et al. Euphytica 98:69, 1997.

Since the spring of 2002, extensive and unknown decline was observed on 20-year-old sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), red oak (Quercus rubra), and English oak (Q. robur) plantations. The trees showed branch and twig dieback associated with bark cankering along the whole stem and an irregular to wilted crown. A closer inspection of the inner part of the symptomatic trunk and roots revealed a dark bluish tissue discoloration. From the symptomatic trunk and root tissue, a dark gray abundant mycelium was consistently isolated on potato dextrose agar (PDA). The sequenced internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of rDNA (GenBank Accession Nos. DQ198265, DQ198266, and DQ198267) showed 99% identity to Botryosphaeria dothidea strain CBS110302 (GenBank Accession No. AY259092). A Fusicoccum sp. with black pycnidia was consistently collected from the cankers. The conidia were hyaline, aseptate, fusiform to narrowly ellipsoidal, with a truncate base (22 × 4.5 μm), referred to as Fusicoccum aesculi (CBS identification), the anamorph of B. dothidea (2). Pathogenicity tests were conducted for all three hosts by stem inoculation on 18-month-old seedlings growing in plastic pots containing a 2:1 turf/sand mixture. Two experiments were conducted using two inoculation techniques. In the first trial, 6-mm-diameter mycelial plugs of B. dothidea were applied to 6-mm-long bark wounds. The same inoculation method was used for application to bark without wounding. Control seedlings were inoculated with sterile agar plugs in a similar fashion as above. Inoculated and control seedlings were kept in a growth chamber and watered once per week. In the second trial, segments of branches 15-cm long were inoculated with 6-mm-diameter B. dothidea plugs (1), with and without any wounding. Control segments of branches were treated with sterile agar plugs in place of fungal mycelium. The branches were incubated at 23°C in moist chambers. For both experiments, the inoculated stem portions were wrapped with Parafilm to prevent desiccation. There were three replicate seedlings per inoculation technique, experiment, and plant species. After 2 months, all seedlings showed bark cankers and pycnidial formation, while the controls were symptomless. An inner dark bluish stem tissue discoloration was observed. The symptoms were more abundant on the segment of branches where the inoculum was applied to the wounded bark. B. dothidea was successfully reisolated, confirming Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, although it is accepted as synonymous of B. berengeriana (2), this is the first report of B. dothidea on sycamore, red oak, and English oak in Italy. The fungus was previously reported in Italy to cause canker on Platanus spp. References: (1) M. E. Sanchez et al. Plant Dis. 87:1515, 2003. (2) B. Slippers et al.

7419,A survey on endophytic fungi within roots of Chenopodiaceae species under different environmental conditions,"Iran with large saline areas is an ideal habitat for growth of plants of the family Chenopodiaceae. Diversity, frequency, and population density of endophyte fungi species depend on the edaphic and climatic conditions, heterogeneity of habitats and niches present within the host tissues, as well as on the competing organisms. In order to isolate endophytic fungi, 52 specimens of each Chenopodiaceae species were collected from its natural habitats in dry and temperate ecosystems located in the south and north of Iran. Staining roots showed that hyphae, spore and microsclerotia of endophytes are present in all surveyed roots. After surface disinfection, specimens were cultured on potato dextrose agar medium (PDA). A total of 192 fungal isolates were obtained and identified on the basis of morphological features and molecular identification. Obtained isolates consisted of eight dematiaceous genera (Alternaria, Bipolaris, Chaetomium, Cladosporium, Curvularia, Embellisia, Macrophomina and Ulocladium) and four non dematiaceous genera (Acremonium, Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium) and twelve types of sterile mycelia. We isolated three species of Alternaria in the studied sites that base on phylogenetic studies located in three different groups. Most of plant roots had a colonization rate of 100% in dry ecosystems (site A, B), while the average colonization rate in temperate ecosystem was 63.8%. However, Shannon's and Fisher's Alpha indices indicate diversity of fungi in temperate ecosystem (site C, 2.45) is higher than that of in other sites. Among the genera, Fusarium was the most abundant in all ecosystems (site A 51%, site B 49% and site C 57%). Climate and soil condition can alter frequency of endophytic fungi in each ecosystem, so that site C with different altitude and soil condition in temperate region had different fungal distribution patterns compared to other studied sites in arid region. Our observations showed that higher endophytic fungi frequency can occur in the roots of plant in arid soils with pH values ranging from 7 to 8 and EC values ranging from 1.4-4.5(dS m(-1)) in high altitude (1230-2000 m) compared to those in roots of plants in temperate soil in low altitude (13m). According to similarly Jaccard index, site A and B had the highest similarity (0.26).","Aletaha, R; Sinegani, AAS; Zafari, D",MYCOSPHERE,2018,10.5943/mycosphere/9/4/1,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.968386680200051,TRUE,2,17,Low,sterile,cultured; isolated; medium; agar; sterile; PDA; ITS; studied; surveyed; collected,"Ulocladium) and four non dematiaceous genera (Acremonium, Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium) and twelve types of sterile mycelia.

15580,Vigna spp. Root-Nodules Harbor Potentially Pathogenic Fungi Controlled By Co-habiting Bacteria,"This study aimed to isolate, identify, and evaluate the pathogenicity of nodule-borne fungi of asymptomatic Vigna spp. plants, grown in soils from preserved tropical dry forests (Caatinga) areas and identify the occurrence of co-habiting bacteria from these plants, and which have potential to control the co-occurring pathogenic fungi. Fungi and bacteria were isolated from three Vigna species (V. unguiculata, V. radiata, and V. mungo), grown in soil samples collected in five preserved Caatinga areas (Northeastern, Brazil). All fungi and selected bacteria were phylogenetically characterized by the sequencing of ITS1-5.8S-ITS2, and the 16S rRNA gene, respectively. The pathogenicity of fungi in cowpea seeds germination was evaluated throughout the inoculation experiment in Petri dishes and pots containing sterile substrate. The potential of nodule-borne bacteria to control pathogenic fungi in cowpea was assessed in a pot experiment with a sterilized substrate by the co-inoculation of fungi and bacteria isolated from the respective individual plants and soils. The 23 fungal isolates recovered were classified within the genera Fusarium, Macrophomina, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, and Nigrospora. The inoculation of fungi in cowpea seeds reduced the emergence of seeds in Petri dishes and pots. Twenty-four bacteria (Agrobacterium sp., Bradyrhizobium sp., Bacillus sp., Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp., Paraburkholderia sp., and Rhizobium sp.) inhibited the harmful effects of Macrophomina sp. and Fusarium sp., increasing the germination and emergency of potted cowpea plants, highlighting the strains Agrobacterium sp.

16637,First Outbreak of Blackleg Caused by Phoma lingam in Commercial Canola Fields in Argentina.,"Canola (Brassica napus) was introduced as an alternative crop to wheat in Argentina. During 2004, typical symptoms of foliar blackleg disease were observed on canola plants in commercial and experimental fields in southern Buenos Aires Province. Average disease incidence was 32% on 2- to 4-month-old plants of canola cvs. Impulse, Master, Mistral, and Teddy. The range of incidence on these cultivars was 21 to 43%. Foliar symptoms were randomly distributed at seedling, rosette, and flowering stages. Symptoms included necrosis and chlorosis of the affected leaf tissue and defoliation. Foliar leaf spots were circular to irregularly oval, 5 to 12 mm in diameter, pale brown in the center, and grayish green at the margin. Small, black pycnidia formed in the center of the adaxial surface of diseased foliage. Under favorable temperature and moisture conditions, lesions enlarged and coalesced. Older lesions appeared chlorotic and desiccated with shredded tissue at the center. A severe defoliation of the lower leaves was observed. As the disease developed, basal stem cankers formed on these plants, although disease incidence in this phase was low. Pieces (0.5 cm long) were taken from leaves and stems of diseased plants, dipped in 70% ethanol, surface sterilized with NaOCl (1%) for 2 min, and rinsed in sterile water. Each segment was blotted dry and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Plates were incubated in the dark at 26°C for 4 days, and then plates were incubated under 12 h of NUV light and 12-h dark for 7 days. Four fungal isolates were obtained. The fungi were examined microscopically and confirmed as Phoma lingam (Tode:Fr.) Desmaz. (Leptosphaeria maculans (Desmaz.) Ces. & De Not) (3,4). P. lingam was the only fungus isolated from the infected tissue. The teleomorph stage was not observed. Koch's postulates were completed for two isolates by spray-inoculating foliage of 3-week-old canola plants of cvs. Impulse, Master, Mistral, and Teddy with a conidial suspension (1 × 106 conidia per ml). The experiment, which included four inoculated plants per isolate and two noninoculated control plants for each cultivar, was performed in a greenhouse at 22 to 24°C and maintained at 75% relative humidity with no supplemental light. Inoculated and control plants were covered with polyethylene bags for 48 h after inoculation. Plants developed small, pale brown lesions on leaves within 11 days for both isolates, and the pathogen was reisolated. Control plants, inoculated only with sterile distilled water, remained symptomless. The experiment was repeated once with similar results. Blackleg is the most important fungal disease affecting canola with a worldwide distribution (1,2). In 1995, the disease was first observed on canola in Argentina in northern Buenos Aires Province, but only in experimental field plots with a low disease incidence. Since that time, it has not been found in other areas where canola is produced. The results emphasize the importance of this pathogen in Argentina, since at the current time most commercial cultivars were susceptible to P. lingam. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an outbreak of P. lingam infection in commercial crops in the main canola-production region in Argentina. References: (1) H. A. Lamey and D. E.

2968,Colonization of Naive Roots from Populus tremula x alba Involves Successive Waves of Fungi and Bacteria with Different Trophic Abilities,"Through their roots, trees interact with a highly complex community of microorganisms belonging to various trophic guilds and contributing to tree nutrition, development, and protection against stresses. Tree roots select for specific microbial species from the bulk soil communities. The root microbiome formation is a dynamic process, but little is known on how the different microorganisms colonize the roots and how the selection occurs. To decipher whether the final composition of the root microbiome is the product of several waves of colonization by different guilds of microorganisms, we planted sterile rooted cuttings of gray poplar obtained from plantlets propagated in axenic conditions in natural poplar stand soil. We analyzed the root microbiome at different time points between 2 and 50 days of culture by combining high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the fungal ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer and bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons with confocal laser scanning microscopy observations. The microbial colonization of poplar roots took place in three stages, but bacteria and fungi had different dynamics. Root bacterial communities were clearly different from those in the soil after 2 days of culture. In contrast, if fungi were also already colonizing roots after 2 days, the initial communities were very close to that in the soil and were dominated by saprotrophs. They were slowly replaced by endophytes and ectomycorhizal fungi. The replacement of the most abundant fungal and bacterial community members observed in poplar roots over time suggest potential competition effect between microorganisms and/or a selection by the host. IMPORTANCE The tree root microbiome is composed of a very diverse set of bacterial and fungal communities. These microorganisms have a profound impact on tree growth, development, and protection against different types of stress. They mainly originate from the bulk soil and colonize the root system, which provides a unique nutrient-rich environment for a diverse assemblage of microbial communities. In order to better understand how the tree root microbiome is shaped over time, we observed the composition of root-associated microbial communities of naive plantlets of poplar transferred in natural soil. The composition of the final root microbiome relies on a series of colonization stages characterized by the dominance of different fungal guilds and bacterial community members over time. Our observations suggest an early stabilization of bacterial communities, whereas fungal communities are established following a more gradual pattern.","Fracchia, F; Mangeot-Peter, L; Jacquot, L; Martin, F; Veneault-Fourrey, C; Deveau, A",APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,2021,10.1128/AEM.02541-20,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.903044527727497,TRUE,2,17,Low,sterile,culture; sterile; rrna; sequencing; illumina; microscopy; observed; confocal; analyzed,"is the product of several waves of colonization by different guilds of microorganisms, we planted sterile rooted cuttings of gray poplar obtained from plantlets propagated in axenic conditions in natural poplar","We analyzed the root microbiome at different time points between 2 and 50 days of culture by combining high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the fungal ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer and | is the product of several waves of colonization by different guilds of microorganisms, we planted sterile rooted cuttings of gray poplar obtained from plantlets propagated in axenic conditions in natural poplar | high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the fungal ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer and bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons with confocal laser scanning microscopy observations.

17283,First Report of Alternaria tenuissima Causing Postharvest Decay on Apple Fruit from Cold Storage in the United States.,"Apples are grown and stored for 9 to 12 months under controlled atmosphere conditions in the United States. During storage, apples are susceptible to various fungal pathogens, including several Alternaria species (2). Alternaria tenuissima (Nees) Wiltshire causes dry core rot (DCR) on apples during storage and has recently occurred in South Africa (1). Losses range widely, but typically occur at 6 to 8% annually due to this disease (2). In February 2013, 'Nittany' apples with round, dark-colored, dry, spongy lesions were obtained from wooden bins in a commercial cold storage facility located in Pennsylvania. Symptomatic fruits were transported to the lab, rinsed with sterile water, and the lesions were sprayed with 70% ethanol until runoff and wiped dry. The skin was aseptically removed with a scalpel, and asymptomatic tissue was placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25°C. Two single-spore isolates were propagated on PDA and permanent cultures were maintained as slants and stored at 4°C. The fungus produced a cottony white mycelium that turned olive-green to brown with abundant aerial hyphae and had a dark brown to black reverse on PDA. Isolates were identified as Alternaria based on conidial morphology as the spores were slightly melanized and obclavate to obpyriform catentulate with longitudinal and transverse septa attached in unbranched chains on simple short conidiophores. Conidia ranged from 10 to 70 μm long (mean 27.7 μm) and 5 to 15 μm wide (mean 5.25 μm) (n = 50) with 1 to 6 transverse and 0 to 2 longitudinal septa. Conidial beaks, when present, were short (5 μm or less) and tapered. Mycelial genomic DNA was extracted, and a portion of the histone gene (357 bp) was amplified via gene specific primers (Alt-His3-F/R) using conventional PCR (Jurick II, unpublished). The forward and reverse sequences were assembled into a consensus representing 2× coverage and MegaBLAST analysis showed that both isolates were 100% identical to Alternaria tenuissima isolates including CR27 (GenBank Accession No. AF404622.1) that caused DCR on apple fruit during storage in South Africa. Koch's postulates were conducted using 10 organic 'Gala' apple fruit that were surface sterilized with soap and water, sprayed with 70% ethanol, and wiped dry. The fruit were aseptically wounded with a nail to a 3 mm depth, inoculated with 50 μl of a conidial suspension (1 × 104 conidia/ml), and stored at 25°C in 80 count boxes on paper trays for 21 days. Mean lesion diameters on inoculated 'Gala' apple fruit were 19.1 mm (±7.4), water only controls (n = 10 fruit) were symptomless, and the experiment was repeated. Symptoms observed on artificially inoculated 'Gala' apple fruit were similar to the decay observed on 'Nittany' apples from cold storage. Based on our findings, it is possible that A. tenuissima can cause decay that originates from wounded tissue in addition to dry core rot, which has been reported (1). Since A. tenuissima produces potent mycotoxins, even low levels of the pathogen could pose a health problem for contaminated fruit destined for processing and may impact export to other countries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of alternaria rot caused by A. tenuissima on apple fruit from cold storage in the United States. References: (1) J. C. Combrink et al. Decid.

16938,First Report of Myrothecium roridum Causing Myrothecium Leaf Spot on Salvia spp. in the United States.,"The genus Salvia includes at least 900 species distributed worldwide. Wild species are found in South America, southern Europe, northern Africa, and North America. Salvia, commonly referred to as sage, is grown commercially as a landscape plant. In August 2006, pale-to-dark brown, circular leaf spots 5 to 20 mm in diameter with concentric rings were observed on Salvia farinacea 'Victoria Blue'. Approximately 5% of the plants in a central Florida nursery were affected. Lesions were visible on both leaf surfaces, and black sporodochia with white, marginal hyphal tuffs were present mostly on the lower surface in older lesions. Symptoms were consistent with those of Myrothecium leaf spot described on other ornamentals such as gardenia, begonia, and New Guinea impatiens (4). Isolations from lesions on potato dextrose agar produced white, floccose colonies with sporodochia in dark green-to-black concentric rings. Conidia were hyaline and cylindrical with rounded ends and averaged 7.4 × 2.0 μm. All characteristics were consistent with the description of Myrothecium roridum Tode ex Fr. (2,3). The internal transcribed spacer regions ITS1, ITS2, and the 5.8s rRNA genomic region of one isolate were sequenced (Accession No. EF151002) and compared with sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Deposited sequences from M. roridum were 96.3 to 98.8% homologous to the isolate from salvia. To confirm pathogenicity, three salvia plants were inoculated by spraying with a conidial suspension of M. roridum (1 × 105 conidia per ml). Plants were covered with plastic bags and incubated in a growth chamber at 28°C for 7 days. Three plants were sprayed with sterile, distilled water as a control and incubated similarly. The symptoms described above were observed in all inoculated plants after 7 days, while control plants remained symptomless. M. roridum was reisolated consistently from symptomatic tissue. There are more than 150 hosts of M. roridum, including one report on Salvia spp. in Brunei (1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of Myrothecium leaf spot caused by M. roridum on Salvia spp. in the United States. Even the moderate level disease present caused damage to the foliage and reduced the marketability of salvia plants. Therefore, control measures may need to be implemented for production of this species in ornamental nurseries. References: (1) D. F. Farr et al. Fungal Databases.

16828,First Report of Crown Rot Caused by Cylindrocladium pauciramosum on Scarlet Honey Myrtle in Italy.,"Scarlet honey myrtle (Melaleuca fulgens R. Br.), native to Australia, is an evergreen colorful shrub (Myrtaceae) and grown in Italy as an ornamental plant. During November 2008, a widespread disease was noticed on ~90% of 3,000 6-month-old M. fulgens cv. Red potted plants. Plants were obtained from cuttings and produced by a commercial nursery in Catania Province. Symptomatic plants showed a crown rot and longitudinal sections of tissues revealed a brown discoloration of the basal stem. As a consequence, leaves gradually became necrotic and abscised, followed by death of the entire plant. Root rots and leaf spots were not observed. M. gibbosa, M. ericifolia, M. thymifolia, and M. elliptica, cultivated in the same nursery, did not show disease symptoms. A Cylindrocladium sp. was consistently isolated from the crown and basal stem of symptomatic plants on potato dextrose agar (1). Ten Cylindrocladium isolates obtained from infected basal stems and crowns were selected and cultured for 8 days at 25°C on carnation leaf agar (CLA). Macroconidiophores consisted of a stipe, a penicillate arrangement, and a stipe extension terminating in an obpyriform to ellipsoidal vesicle (6 to 10 μm in diameter). Cylindrical conidia were rounded at both ends, straight, 1-septate, and 42 to 60 × 4 to 5 μm. All single-conidial isolates were mated with opposite tester strains of C. pauciramosum on CLA and produced fertile perithecia (3). Perithecia were solitary or in groups, orange to red-brown, subglobose to ovoid, and 270 to 400 μm high × 180 to 290 μm in diameter. Further confirmation of species was obtained by amplification and sequencing of the intergenic spacer (IGS) region of rDNA with the M13 forward (-20) and M13 reverse primers. On the basis of the complete IGS sequence, two primer sets (218F/218R and 106F/106R) were designed and successfully used in a nested-PCR protocol for the detection of C. pauciramosum from tissues of infected plants (2). On the basis of morphological characters, mating type, and molecular data, the isolates were identified as C. pauciramosum C.L. Schoch & Crous. One representative isolate (DISTEF-MFR2; CBS 124657) was deposited at Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures open fungi collection (Fungal Biodiversity Centre, Utrecht, the Netherlands). Pathogenicity tests were performed by adding sterile water to CLA cultures of C. pauciramosum from a single-conidial isolate and incorporating the resulting spore suspension (105 conidia per ml) on the soil surface of 20 3-month-old M. fulgens cv. Red potted plants. The same number of plants served as uninoculated controls. Following inoculation, plants were well irrigated and maintained in a growth chamber at 25 ± 1°C and 90 to 95% relative humidity. All inoculated plants developed crown rot symptoms identical to those observed in the nursery 2 months after inoculation. Control plants remained symptomless. C. pauciramosum was always reisolated from the infected plants and identified as previously described. C. pauciramosum was previously detected in Italy as being responsible for a leaf spot on M. hypericifolia (3). To our knowledge, this is the first record in the world of crown rot of scarlet honey myrtle caused by C. pauciramosum. References: (1) P. W. Crous.

16846,First Report of Dry Rot Caused by Fusarium oxysporum on Rose (Rosa spp.) in Brazil.,"Roses are a high-value niche crop in the higher altitudes of northeastern Brazil. From July of 2007 and throughout 2008, severe stem rot and wilting of rose seedlings were observed in commercial fields in the São Benedito District, Ceará State, Brazil. Although economic losses due to the disease are unknown, it poses a threat to the growing rose industry in that region. Symptoms included leaf yellowing and abscission followed by plant collapse. Symptoms appeared earlier when grafted seedlings were produced during periods of high relative humidity (80 to 98%) and warm temperatures (20 to 31°C). In the laboratory, symptomatic seedlings were rinsed with distilled water, surface sterilized with 0.5% NaOCl, and incubated on PDA at 26 ± 2°C. Fusarium oxysporum was consistently isolated from infected scions and rootstocks. Identification of F. oxysporum was based on colony and conidia morphology obtained from single-spore colonies. Five 4-week-old rose ('Carola') seedlings were inoculated with a culture of fungus by spraying the needle-wounded scion with a spore suspension (1 × 105 CFU/ml). The spore suspension was obtained from a 1-week-old PDA culture incubated at 26 ± 2°C. Control seedlings were sprayed with sterile water. Inoculated seedlings were incubated for the first 48 h in a saturated humidity chamber. After 20 days at room temperature, the scion tissue of inoculated seedlings turned necrotic. Two symptomatic seedlings were placed in a saturated humidity chamber for 24 h to determine if fungal sporulation could be observed on the surface of the tissue. After 5 to 7 days, a white mycelium was observed over the necrotic tissue. Seedlings sprayed with sterile water remained symptomless. F. oxysporum was reisolated from symptomatic tissue.

16131,Molecular identification of a novel endophytic fungus Botryotrichum murorum associated with tomato in Iraq,"Due to the economic importance of tomato crops in Iraq, this study was designed to investigate new endophytic fungal species related to Sordariomycetes (Ascomycota), a class known for its diverse ecological roles. From Al-Zubair region, which includes well-known farms of tomato and located in the South of Basrah Province in Iraq, a total of 35 cultivated vegetable tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) samples were collected. These samples were processed by cutting them into small pieces sized (5-6 mm) using sterile blades. Two isolation protocols, including the Solid Culture Method (SCM) and the Moist Culture Method (MCM), were employed for endophytic fungal isolation. The recovered endophytic fungi were purified, and axenic cultures of each isolated fungal species were then identified initially based on macro and micro-morphological features. For accurate taxonomy, molecular technique was utilized by genomic DNA extraction and PCR amplification of multigene sequences such as ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacers 1 and 2 including the 5.8S nrDNA), LSU (D1/D2 domains of the 28S nrDNA), RPB2 (partial RNA polymerase II second largest subunit gene), TEF-1α (translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene) and β-tubulin (TUB2) gene were used for identification.

16853,First Report of Sclerotinia Stem Rot Caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum on Hibiscus trionum in New York.,"Hibiscus trionum L. (Venice mallow) is an annual weed widely distributed in the United States. In September of 2008, Venice mallow plants with bleached stems and necrotic tissues were observed in a commercial field of cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. cv. Moreton) in Geneva, NY. White, cottony mycelium and dark sclerotia were readily found on the stems and in the stem pith. Cabbage plants in direct contact with diseased Venice mallow also displayed signs and symptoms of infection by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary. Sclerotia from within diseased Venice mallow stems were placed in 9-cm-diameter petri plates on potato dextrose agar amended with 0.1 g/liter each of chloramphenicol and streptomycin (ABPDA) and incubated at room temperature. In addition, diseased stem tissue was surface disinfested for 3 min in 0.525% sodium hypochlorite solution, rinsed for 3 min in sterile distilled water, and placed on ABPDA. After 5 days, hyphae from the colony margin were excised and transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates. Fungal cultures consisting of white mycelia and medium-sized (~4 mm), black, irregular sclerotia were consistently recovered and identified as S. sclerotiorum based on morphological characteristics (1). Pathogenicity of two isolates (one from a sclerotium and one from stem tissue) was determined by inoculating seven 43-day-old Venice mallow plants growing in greenhouse pots (65 mm in diameter). Mycelia plugs (7 mm in diameter) were excised from 2-day-old PDA cultures of each isolate and placed on the stems at the soil line. Seven control plants were inoculated with noncolonized PDA plugs. All plants were enclosed in plastic bags for 72 h and placed under shade in the greenhouse with temperatures from 20 to 38°C (average 27°C). Symptoms similar to those observed in the affected fields were evident within 2 days after inoculation, while control plants remained symptomless. S. sclerotiorum was successfully recovered from infected plant tissue, fulfilling Koch's postulates. The experiment was repeated with similar results. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Sclerotinia stem rot of Hibiscus trionum caused by S. sclerotiorum (2,3). References: (1) L. Buchwaldt. Sclerotinia White Mold.

17502,First Report of Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato Causing Leaf Curling and Petiole Anthracnose on Celery (Apium graveolens) in Michigan.,"In September 2010, celery plants with leaf cupping and petiole twisting were observed in commercial production fields located in Barry, Kent, Newago, and Van Buren Counties in Michigan. Long, elliptical lesions were observed on petioles but signs (mycelia, conidia, or acervuli) were not readily observed. Celery petioles were incubated in humid chambers (acrylic boxes with wet paper towels). After 24 h, conidia corresponding to the genus Colletotrichum were observed. Isolations were performed by excising pieces of celery tissue from the lesion margin and placing them on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with 30 ppm of rifampicin and 100 ppm of ampicillin. Plates were incubated at 21 ± 2°C under fluorescent light for 5 days. Fungal colony morphology was gray with salmon-colored masses of spores when viewed from above, and carmine when viewed from below. Isolates were single-spored and placed on 30% glycerol in -20°C, and cryoconservation media (20% glycerol, 0.04% yeast extract, 0.1% malt extract, 0.04% glucose, 0.02% K2HPO4) at -80°C. Conidia were 8.5 to 12.0 × 2.8 to 4.0 μm and straight fusiform in shape. Three isolates were confirmed as C. acutatum sensu lato based on sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal RNA and the 1-kb intron of the glutamine synthase gene (3), both with 100% similarity with Glomerella acutata sequences. Sequences were submitted to GenBank (Accession Nos. JQ951599 and JQ951600 for ITS and GS, respectively). Additionally, C. acutatum specific primer CaIntg was used in combination with the primer ITS4 on 54 isolates from symptomatic celery plants, obtaining the expected 490-pb fragment (1). Koch's postulates were completed by inoculating 4-week-old celery seedlings of cultivars Sabroso, Green Bay, and Dutchess using three plants per cultivar. Prior to inoculation, seedlings were incubated for 16 h in high relative humidity (≥95%) by enclosing the plants in humid chambers. Seven-day-old C. acutatum s. l. colonies were used to prepare the inoculum. Seedlings were spray-inoculated with a C. acutatum s. l. conidial suspension of 1 × 106 conidia/ml in double-distilled water plus Tween 0.01%. Two control seedlings per cultivar were sprayed with sterile, double-distilled water plus 0.01% Tween. Plants were enclosed in bags for 96 h post inoculation and incubated in a greenhouse at 27°C by day/20°C by night with a 16-h photoperiod. Leaf curling was observed on all inoculated plants of the three cultivars 4 days after inoculation (DAI). Petiole lesions were observed 14 to 21 DAI. Conidia were observed in lesions after incubation in high humidity at 21 ± 2°C for 24 to 72 h. Symptomatic tissue was excised and cultured onto PDA and resulted in C. acutatum colonies. Control plants remained symptomless. C. acutatum (4) and C. orbiculare (2) were reported to cause celery leaf curl in Australia in 1966 (2,4). To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. acutatum s. l. infecting celery in Michigan. References: (1) A. E. Brown et al. Phytopathology 86:523, 1996. (2) D. F. Farr and A. Y. Rossman.

14261,Mycodiversity and biotechnological potential of endophytic fungi isolated from hydrophytes,"Foliar endophytic fungi were isolated from regular hydrophytic plants such as Eichhornia crassipes (Pontederiaceae), Nymphaea nouchali (Nymphaeaceae), Vallisneria spiralis (Hydrocharitaceae) growing in a pond in the Anna Zoological Park, Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Five hundred leaf segments from each plant species were inoculated in Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) medium. A total of 18 different endophytic fungi could be isolated from three host surveyed. Hyphomycetes group was the most prevalent endophyte than ascomycetes, coelomycetes, and sterile form. Nymphaea nouchali had more endophytic fungi (18 species) followed by Eichhornia crassipes (12 species), and Vallisneria spiralis (11 species). To our knowledge Vallisneria spiralis is studied for endophytic fungi diversity for the first time. Among the 18 endophytic fungi isolated, nine were present in all three hosts investigated for endophytic fungi. Curvularia lunata, Chaetomium indicum, Nigrospora oryzae, Pestalotiopsis sp. showed < 5% of colonization frequency in all three host species studied. The culture filtrate of Curvularia lunata, Nigrospora oryzae, Chaetomium indicum and Pestalotiopsis microspora investigated contained alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids, tannins and steroids. The dominant endophytic fungi were tested for production of extracellular enzymes like amylase, cellulase, L- asparaginase, laccase and protease. Curvularia lunata, Chaetomium indicum and Pestalotiopsis microspora produced all the enzymes tested, whereas Nigrospora oryzae did not produce L- asparaginase.

14825,New frontiers of essential oils research: Biotransformation of the phytocomplex and its pure compounds by endophytic fungi,"Terpenes are the main constituents of essential oils in plants. They play a considerable role in prevention and therapy of several diseases and constitute building blocks for the synthesis of many useful compounds. In recent years a significant preference towards biotransformation processes has been carried out by using microbial cells as biocatalysts and gathering particular interest for the high production yield of high purity compounds and for their eco-friendly technological approach. The purpose of this study was to investigate the biotransformation of the essential oil of Piper aduncum L., a plant used in traditional Ecuadorian medicine for its antiseptic and antibiotic properties, by endophytic fungi isolated from aerial parts of the plant. Biotransformations applied to terpene phytocomplexes and to their isolated pure chemicals by endophytic micro-organisms isolated from the same plant represent a new approach to the production of new molecules by in vitro strategies. Piper aduncum essential oil has been obtained by steam distillation of wild aerial parts of adult plants collected in Wasakentsa (Ecuador), in January 2006 and supplied by Fundacion Chankuap (Macas, Ecuador). The startup of the research has then been carried out at University of Ferrara Lab performing chemical composition of the essential oil by GC-MS, while the endophytic fungi isolation and subculturing of pure strains on PDA has been processed at CiVaBi (Universidad Politecnica Salesiana, Ecuador). Taxonomic identification of the strains evidencing biotransformation capacity is still in progress. The endophytic fungal strains to be tested for biotransformation activity have been inoculated in 250 ml sterile flasks with PDB liquid medium; after seven days of growing aliquots of whole essential oil or of pure terpene compounds have been added. At different times, samples of biotransforming broth have been collected and monitored for oxidation-reduction reactions. The main components of P. aduncum essential oil, i.e. dillapiol, trans-ocimene, piperitone and terpinen-4-ol, were tested for biotransformation. The biotransformation activity was recorded on two compounds: piperitone and transocimene. Piperitone was transformed into 6-hydroxy-piperitone by EC19 strain evidencing the highest biotransformation yield. The trans-ocimene biotransformation showed good results with all strains tested, especially with EC19 strain giving the compounds dimethyl-octatetraene, dimethyl-octatrienol, dimethyloctadiendiol.",Scalvenzi L.,Acta Horticulturae,2014,10.17660/ActaHortic.2014.1030.15,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.979382522718595,TRUE,2,16,Low,sterile,isolated; isolation; medium; sterile; PDA; ITS; collected; processed; tested; monitored,endophytic fungal strains to be tested for biotransformation activity have been inoculated in 250 ml sterile flasks with PDB liquid medium; after seven days of growing aliquots of whole essential oil,"plant used in traditional Ecuadorian medicine for its antiseptic and antibiotic properties, by endophytic fungi isolated from aerial parts of the plant.

15625,Co-inoculation with the root endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica and endophytic bacteria improves growth of solanaceous vegetable seedlings,"Application of beneficial rhizobacteria may improve the growth of vegetable transplants and reduce diseases. Plant growth promotion effects of single, and combined, inoculation of the root colonizing endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica and bacterial root endophytes isolated from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), chilli (Capsicum annuum L.), and eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) in seedlings were examined as an initial step for developing microbial inocula for transplant production. The isolates were screened for plant growth promotion ability after seed inoculation. Seedling vigor index was assessed by a roll towel assay followed by evaluation of seedling growth in extruded plastic seedling trays with sterile vermiculite as the planting medium. A compatibility test of bacterial endophytes with P. indica was performed by dual culture plate assay on potato dextrose agar medium. Four isolates from tomato, and 2 each from chilli and eggplant, had compatible reactions with the endophytic fungus. Performance of individual and combined inoculation of the root endophytic fungus and compatible endophytic bacteria in host plants was evaluated. Inoculation with microbial agents improved seedling growth. Combined inoculation of bacterial endophytes and fungal endophyte had no influence on the root colonization pattern of P. indica in tomato, chilli, and eggplant seedlings.

5,Colonization and antagonistic activity of endophytic fungi in seagrasses: Understanding endophyte interactions,"Aims: This study assessed the colonization and antagonistic interaction of endophytic fungi isolated from the Philippine seagrasses. Methodology and results: A total of 2690 explants from Enhalus acoroides, Thalassia hemprichii and Cymodocea serrulata were examined in this study. The colonization rate per seagrass species and tissue type were calculated from the number of explants with fungal growth after 14-day incubation on PDA culture media. The presence of fungal structures in seagrass tissues was examined by a histological method. The co-culture method and non-volatile compound assays determined the interaction between endophytic fungal species. Results showed that eight species of endophytic fungi colonized seagrasses, varying with host species and tissue types. Aspergillus ochraceopetaliformis and Penicillium citrinum were the most predominant particularly in E. acoroides leaves. Histological examination of seagrass explants revealed that endophytic fungi preferably colonize the intercellular and intracellular spaces of the cortical tissues. No fungal hyphae were detected in the vascular tissues of the three seagrass species suggesting no systemic fungal growth. The endophytic fungi in seagrasses interact antagonistically with each other in which hyphal interference, the presence of a demarcation line at the interaction zone, changes in colony colour and growth inhibition were observed during the interaction. Conclusion, significance and impact of study: Seagrasses were colonized by a dynamic assemblage of endophytic fungi, which interact antagonistically with each other. Endophytes' ability to restrict the growth of other fungal species during interaction suggested their importance in biocontrol and the production of inhibitory molecules.","Kinamot, VB; Monotilla, AP",MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY,2023,10.21161/mjm.220097,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.730372004081763,TRUE,2,16,Low,no fungal hyphae,isolated; culture; colony; PDA; examined; observed; histological; examined; assessed,revealed that endophytic fungi preferably colonize the intercellular and intracellular spaces of the cortical tissues.

3093,ABUNDANCE AND DIVERSITY OF MICROFUNGI IN LEAF-LITTER OF A LOWLAND RAIN-FOREST IN COSTA-RICA,"An efficient method by which to bring tropical leaf-litter fungi into culture was sought in order to survey these organisms for pharmacologically useful metabolites. A simplified particle-filtration procedure, based on the method of soil washing, was tested to determine if the characteristic fungal genera of leaf litter could be preferentially isolated while minimizing recovery of soil and common saprobic fungi. At the same time, we made some preliminary measurements of the magnitude of fungal species richness in tropical forest litter. Litter from four sites in a primary rain forest of the Osa Peninsula of Costa Rica were examined. Pulverized leaf litter from each site was separated into fine particles and repeatedly washed. From each leaf litter sample, a 1-ml particle suspension was plated onto two selective media. One-ml suspensions of leaf litter from the four samples yielded a total 1709 isolates, ranging from 281 to 559 isolates/sample (mean = 424). The number of species/sample ranged from 78 to 134. Rarefaction curves based on the number of species expected in random subsamples were used to compare species richness among samples. Many uncommon genera of litter fungi were recovered as well as coelomycetes, sterile strains, endophytes, and phytopathogens. Typical soil fungi were a relatively minor component of the total isolates. Species-abundance distributions showed that there were few abundant species and a high proportion of rare species. In no sample did the single most abundant species account for more than 23% of the total isolates. Species present in all samples were Cylindrosympodiella sp., Glomerella cingulata, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Pestalotiopsis guepinii and an unidentified coelomycete. Particle filtration of leaf litter appears to be practical for use in a microbial screening program because it circumvents the tedious process of hand isolation of uncommon genera of litter fungi. However, if endophytic or soil fungal communities from the same region are being examined simultaneously as reservoirs for screening isolates, then redundant taxa distributed vertically through different forest strata will need to be eliminated.","BILLS, GF; POLISHOOK, JD",MYCOLOGIA,1994,10.2307/3760635,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.95874778837954,TRUE,2,16,Low,sterile,isolated; isolation; culture; plated; sterile; selective media; examined; examined; tested,"richness among samples.

16820,First Report of Leaf Blight and Root and Foot Rot of a Strelitzia Caused by Phytophthora nicotianae in Italy.,"Bird of paradise, also known as crane flower (Strelitzia reginae Aiton), is a monocotyledonous flowering plant indigenous to South Africa. It is commonly grown and commercialized as an ornamental plant and it is appreciated for its beautiful flowers. In October of 2008, dark leaf spots and leaf blight associated with a severe root and foot rot were observed on several plants of S. reginae grown in a private garden located in Fiumicino, Italy. Small fragments of tissues (approximately 3 mm) collected from the base of leaves and roots and the margins of brown lesions, previously surface disinfected with 0.5% NaOCl, were plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 22°C in the dark. White, web-like, slow-growing colonies with coenocytic mycelium and hyphal swellings consistently developed from all plated tissue samples. Sporangia were ovoid or ellipsoid with prominent papillae (including some bipapillate) and frequently caducous with a short stalk. The dimensions of sporangia were 27 to 64 × 23 to 45 μm (average 43 × 35 μm). Chlamydospores were terminal or intercalary and approximately 30 μm in diameter. Isolates were considered heterothallic because they did not produce gametangia in vitro or in planta. On the basis of morphological features, isolates were identified as Phytophthora nicotianae (Breda de Haan). The identity was confirmed by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence comparison in NCBI database with 99% identity with sequences available in GenBank (e.g., EU331089) and with cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (Cox I) with 99% identity with AY564196 by Kroon et al. (2). The sequences of one isolate, AB177, were deposited in GenBank (Accession Nos. FN430681 and FN552051 for ITS and Cox I, respectively). Pathogenicity tests were conducted in the greenhouse on leaves of a 1-year-old potted S. reginae plant by placing 5-mm-diameter mycelial plugs, cut from the margins of 10-day-old actively growing cultures, with mycelium in contact with plant tissues gently wounded with a needle. Controls were treated as described above, except that PDA sterile plugs were used. Plants were misted with water and placed in sealed plastic bags for 48 h. After 10 days, artificially wounded strelitzia leaves showed lesions (approximately 1 cm long). Controls remained symptomless. All inoculated leaves showed the same leaf symptoms as observed on naturally diseased plants. The pathogen was consistently reisolated from lesions. P. nicotianae has been reported as the causal agent of leaf blight and stem, collar, and root rot on several plants (1). It has been reported as an agent of Phytophthora blight on strelitzia in Japan (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. nicotianae on strelitzia in Italy. References: (1) D. C.

16845,First Report of a Fruit Rot Disease of Avocado Caused by Neofusicoccum mangiferae.,"Production of avocado (Persea americana) has increased significantly during the last 10 years in Taiwan and the area of cultivation is approximately 500 ha. The most important postharvest disease of avocado is anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) in Taiwan (1). In 2008, a new disease was found to be infecting avocado fruit at some orchards in Tainan County of southern Taiwan. Infected avocados developed smooth, brown, circular spots first on the surface of harvested fruits. A fungus was always isolated from the margin of lesions and could also be found from symptomless fruit pedicles and stems. Fungal colonies cultured on acidified potato dextrose agar (PDA with lactic acid; pH 3.8) were initially colorless, turned dark gradually, and ultimately became gray to dark gray. After 4 days under fluorescent light at 25°C, pycnidia formed on PDA. Conidia obtained from fruiting bodies were ovate, one celled, and hyaline, with an average length and width of 12.9 (9.9 to 15.6) × 6.4 (5.2 to 7.2) μm. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence of ribosomal DNA of this fungus was analyzed and submitted to GenBank (No. EU847427). It showed a sequence identity of 99% with Neofusicoccum mangiferae ((Syd. & P. Syd.) Crous, Slippers & A.J.L. Phillips) (GenBank No. AY615185). Thus, both morphological and molecular results confirmed the isolated fungus as N. mangiferae. Five avocado fruits were used to test the pathogenicity with three different treatment inoculation sites on each fruit. Wounded and unwounded sites on fruit were inoculated with mycelia agar plugs (0.5 mm in diameter) excised from a monoconidial culture and the fruit was kept in a plastic box with high humidity for 2 days at room temperature. Brown lesions appeared on all wounded sites 2 days postinoculation (dpi) and on unwounded sites at 4 dpi. The pathogen was reisolated from the lesions of inoculated fruits and found to be N. mangiferae, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. In control experiments, sterile agar plugs were placed on the wounded avocado fruits. These fruits remained completely free from symptoms throughout the experiment. Several species of Botryosphaeria have been reported on avocado, including N. parvum (anamorph of B. parva), Fusicoccum aesculi (anamorph of B. dothidea), and Dothiorella aromatica (= F. luteum). To our knowledge, this is the first report of N. mangiferae causing fruit rot of avocado in Taiwan. Previously, N. mangiferae has been reported on mango trees worldwide, especially in Australia and Thailand (2). The presence of N. mangiferae in the subtropical area presents a serious disease problem not only to avocado but also to mango. References: (1) Y. P. Tsai, ed.

14287,Antibacterial efficacy of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles against Enterococcus faecalis Biofilm: An in vitro study,"Aim: This study aims to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) produced using the fungi against Enterococcus faecalis biofilm model on root dentin. Materials and Methods: AgNPs were biosynthesized using the fungi Fusarium semitectum isolated from healthy leaves of Withania somnifera. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of AgNPs was determined by microbroth dilution method using series of dilutions. MIC dose was standardized to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy. For biofilm model, thirty root dentin blocks prepared using human extracted single-rooted teeth were inoculated with E. faecalis in Trypticase soy agar broth for 2 weeks with alternate day replenishment and randomly divided into three groups (n = 10 each) and treated as: Group I: Sterile distilled water, Group II: AgNPs, and Group III: 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Each dentin block was rinsed in saline, vortex shaken for 60 s, and serial decimal dilutions were prepared and plated on trypticase soy agar plates and incubated for 24 h followed by CFU colony counting and statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Tukey honestly significant difference test. Results: MIC of AgNPs for E. faecalis was determined as 30 mg/ml. No significant difference was seen between AgNPs and 2% CHX when compared to the control group with mean colony counts being 2.4, 2.5, and 6.77 CFU/ml (107), respectively (P < 0.0001), against E. faecalis biofilm.

In this study, we assessed the diversity of fungi associated with the red alga Pterocladiella capillacea at Chao-Jin Park, Keelung, Taiwan. Algal segments of healthy and dead thalli were washed/sterilized with different solutions (sterile artificial seawater, 70% ethanol, and 4% sodium hypochlorite), plated on three different media (glucose-yeast extract-peptone seawater agar (GYPS), potato dextrose seawater agar (PDAS), and artificial seawater agar (SA)), and isolated as pure cultures. Identification was mainly based on BLAST search analysis of the internal transcribed spacers of rDNA (ITS). The highest isolation frequency (no. of segment with fungi/total no. of segment x 100) was in dead thalli (61.23%), thalli washed with seawater (88.38%), and thalli plated on GYPS (62.10%). A total of 3187 isolates were cultured, representing 129 taxa (in 67 genera); the higher species richness was isolated from healthy thalli (119 species), thalli washed with seawater (111 species), and on GYPS (112 species). Ascomycota (Eurotiales, Hypocreales, Capnodiales, Pleosporales, Xylariales) dominated the fungal community in P. capillacea with many basidiomycetous yeasts and few Mucoromycota. Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Penicillium (Ascomycota), and Rhodosporidium (Basidiomycota) were the dominant genera associated with the alga. The surface washing/sterilization schemes of algal thalli affected fungal diversity, but the isolation media used did not. While these genera are known producers of antimicrobial secondary metabolites, they might form a mutualistic relationship with P. capillacea by exchanging nutrients from photosynthesis for protection from microbial diseases.","Cha, HJ; Chiang, MWL; Guo, SY; Lin, SM; Pang, KL",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2021,10.3390/jof7080651,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.96046346466601,TRUE,2,15,Low,sterile,cultured; isolated; isolation; plated; agar; sterile; ITS; assessed,NA,"extract-peptone seawater agar (GYPS), potato dextrose seawater agar (PDAS), and artificial seawater agar (SA)), and isolated as pure cultures.

4585,Diversity and biotechnological potential of endophytic Bacillus species originating from the stem apoplast fluid of sugarcane plants,"The genus Bacillus has been isolated from a wide range of environments and comprises species with biotechnological applications, such as bioinseticides, biofungicides, and biofertilizers. This study investigated the endophytic occurrence and diversity of Bacilli in the apoplastic fluid of sugarcane cultivated in Brazil. Their biocontrol activity against fungi and their plant growth promotion (PGP) potential in sugarcane mini-set plants were also evaluated. Forty-two Bacillus colonies were isolated from the apoplastic fluid of one-year-old commercial sugarcane varieties and analyzed by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. The ability to produce indols and siderophores and to solubilize phosphate and zinc were evaluated in vitro, along with their cellulose and protease activity and, antagonistic activity against sugarcane phytopatogenic fungi. The PGP potential was determined using strains which were inoculated in sugarcane mini-set plants grown in sterile substrate and later in unsterilized soil pots. The 16S rRNA analyses demonstrated high bacterial diversity with the majority closely related to B. megaterium followed by B. aryabhattai and B. cereus. B. pumilus, B. velezensis, B. safensis, B. flexus and Paenibacillus taichungensis species were also identified. Most strains were able to produce indol, solubilize zinc oxide and presented cellulase activity, while phosphate solubilization and siderophore production was observed in only few strains. The strains LMC21, LMC44 and LMC48 presented high biocontrol activity against the sugarcane fungi Colletotrichum falcatum. The spore formation was observed for strains grown for 8 days in the HCT medium but not in presence of sugarcane juice. Some strains also accumulated higher biomass in sugarcane (sterile conditions) and a mixture of three Bacillus strains performed better in the soil-pot inoculation experiment. These findings show for the first time that many Bacillus species are present in the apoplastic fluid of sugarcane grown in Brazil and indicate that some strains have PGP and biocontrol potential for application as biofertilizer in sugarcane plants.","de Melo, LHV; Rocha, FYO; Vidal, MS; Gitahy, PD; Arruda, GM; Barreto, CP; Alves, PB; Ramos, ETD; Rossi, CN; Schwab, S; Sorte, PMFB; Avelar, JP; Baldani, JI",APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,2021,10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.103985,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.955489358439297,TRUE,2,15,Low,sterile,isolated; medium; sterile; rrna; sequencing; observed; investigated; analyzed; evaluated,PGP potential was determined using strains which were inoculated in sugarcane mini-set plants grown in sterile substrate and later in unsterilized soil pots.

16808,First Report of Crown Rot and Stem Rot Caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG-4 on Marmalade Bush in Italy.,"Marmalade bush (Streptosolen jamesonii (Benth.) Miers), also known as fire bush, is an evergreen, perennial shrub in the family Solanaceae, which is native to South America (Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru). In Italy, this species is cultivated as an ornamental creeper or bush. During September 2009, a new disease was observed in a stock of ~10,000 pot-grown, 2-month-old plants of marmalade bush in a nursery in eastern Sicily, Italy. More than 50% of the plants exhibited symptoms of disease. Disease symptoms consisted of extensive water-soaked, dark brown lesions at the crown level that girdled entire stems and an internal brown discoloration of cortical tissue. Infected plants died within a few days. Diseased tissue was disinfested for 10 s in 1% NaOCl, rinsed with sterile water, and plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with streptomycin sulfate at 100 mg/liter. Fungal colonies were initially white, turned brown after 2 to 3 days, and produced irregularly shaped, brown sclerotia. Microscopic examination showed mycelium consistent with Rhizoctonia solani Kühn that branched at right angles, constricted at the base of the branch originating from primary hyphae, and septate near the constriction. The number of nuclei per hyphal cell was determined on cultures grown at 25°C on 2% water agar in petri plates by staining with 1% safranin O and 3% KOH solution (1) and examined at ×400. The hyphal cells were all multinucleate. Anastomosis group was determined by pairing isolates on 2% water agar in petri plates (2). Pairings were made with tester strains AG-1 IA, AG-2-2-1, AG-2-2IIIB, AG-2-2IV, AG-3, AG-4, AG-5, AG-6, and AG-11. Anastomosis was observed only with tester isolates of AG-4. Pathogenicity tests were performed by placing 1-cm2 plugs of PDA from 5-day-old mycelial cultures near the base of the stem on 25 potted, healthy, 2-month-old rooted cuttings of marmalade bush. The same number of plants treated with 1-cm2 PDA plugs served as controls. Following inoculation, all plants were maintained for 20 days at 25°C and 95% relative humidity under a 12-h fluorescent light/dark regimen. Crown and stem symptoms, identical to those observed in the nursery, developed 5 days after inoculation on all inoculated plants. Control plants remained symptomless. R. solani was consistently reisolated from symptomatic tissues and identified as previously described. To our knowledge, this is the first report of R. solani causing disease on marmalade bush.

17242,First Report of Penicillium expansum Isolates Resistant to Pyrimethanil from Stored Apple Fruit in Pennsylvania.,"Apples in the United States are stored in low-temperature controlled atmospheres for 9 to 12 months and are highly susceptible to blue mold decay. Penicillium spp. cause significant economic losses worldwide and produce mycotoxins that contaminate processed apple products. Blue mold is managed by a combination of cultural practices and the application of fungicides. In 2004, a new postharvest fungicide, pyrimethanil (Penbotec 400 SC, Janseen PMP, Beerse, Belgium) was registered for use in the United States to control blue mold on pome fruits (1). In this study, 10 blue mold symptomatic 'Red Delicious' apples were collected in May 2011 from wooden bins at a commercial facility located in Pennsylvania. These fruit had been treated with Penbotec prior to controlled atmosphere storage. Ten single-spore Penicillium spp. isolates were analyzed for growth using 96-well microtiter plates containing Richards minimal medium amended with a range of technical grade pyrimethanil from 0 to 500 μg/ml. Conidial suspensions adjusted to 1 × 105 conidia/ml were added to three 96-well plates for each experiment; all experiments were repeated three times. Nine resistant isolates had prolific mycelial growth at 500 μg/ml, which is 1,000 times the discriminatory dose that inhibited baseline sensitive P. expansum isolates from Washington State (1). However, one isolate (R13) had limited conidial germination and no mycelial proliferation at 0.5 μg/ml and was categorized as sensitive. One resistant (R22) and one sensitive (R13) isolate were selected on the basis of their different sensitivities to pyrimethanil. Both isolates were identified as P. expansum via conventional PCR using β-tubulin gene-specific primers according to Sholberg et al. (2). Analysis of the 2X consensus amplicon sequences from R13 and R22 matched perfectly (100% identity and 0.0 E value) with other P. expansum accessions in GenBank including JN872743.1, which was isolated from decayed apple fruit from Washington State. To determine if pyrimethanil applied at the labeled rate of 500 μg/ml would control R13 or R22 in vivo, organic 'Gala' apple fruit were wounded, inoculated with 50 μl of a conidial suspension (1 × 104 conidia/ml) of either isolate, dipped in Penbotec fungicide or sterile water, and stored at 25°C for 7 days. Twenty fruit composed a replicate within a treatment and the experiment was performed twice. Non-inoculated water-only controls were symptomless, while water-dipped inoculated fruit had 100% decay with mean lesion diameters of 36.8 ± 2.68 mm for R22 and 38.5 ± 2.61 mm for R13. The R22 isolate caused 30% decay with 21.6 ± 5.44 mm lesions when inoculated onto Penbotec-treated apples, while the R13 isolate had 7.5% decay incidence with mean lesion diameters of 23.1 ± 3.41 mm. The results from this study demonstrate that P. expansum pyrimethanil-resistant strains are virulent on Penbotec-treated apple fruit and have the potential to manifest in decay during storage. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of pyrimethanil resistance in P. expansum from Pennsylvania, a major apple growing region for the United States. Moreover, these results illuminate the need to develop additional chemical, cultural, and biological methods to control this fungus. References: (1) H. X. Li and C. L. Xiao.

10828,MORPHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY OF PHIALOCEPHALA-FORTINII IN ROOTS OF RHODODENDRON BRACHYCARPUM,"The morphology of the interaction of three strains of Phialocephala fortinii with the roots of Rhododendron brachycarpum was examined by light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy using material grown in axenic Petri dish cultures and in nonsterile pot cultures. In Petri dish cultures, Phialocephala fortinii quickly overwhelmed root tips of young seedlings, causing distortion of cells of the root apex and inhibition of elongation. In older roots, mature, vacuolated, and moribund epidermal cells were penetrated. In pot-cultured plants the epidermis was heavily colonized by hyphae growing parallel to the long axis of the root. Microsclerotia formed within individual cells, between the epidermal and the subepidermal layers, and within cells surrounding the point of emergence of lateral roots. Hyphae did not invade the stele. The effects of two strains of Phialocephala fortinii on shoot dry weight accumulation of R. brachycarpum grown in pot culture were examined and compared with the effects of Hymenoscyphus ericae, Myxotrichum stipitatum, Oidiodendron echinulatum, and Pseudogymnoascus roseus. One strain of Phialocephala fortinii had a significant negative effect on dry weight accumulation, whereas a second had no effect. Hymenoscyphus ericae had a positive effect.

17532,First Report of Club Root Caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae on Canola in Australia.,"In 2009, a disease survey was conducted in 97 commercial canola (Brassica napus L.) fields in Western Australia by the Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia (DAFWA). In about 20% of the fields from the northern agricultural region of Western Australia, small patches were observed where canola plants showed symptoms of stunting and wilting. These plants were collected and roots of affected plants were washed thoroughly and examined for the presence of root disease. Small galls and clublike structures were observed on the secondary roots and sometimes on the main root of the affected plants. Examination of thin free hand sections from the root galls revealed that several cortical cells were enlarged and full of resting spores. The diameter of resting spores ranged between 2.5 and 3.0 μm. Plasmodia and zoosporangia were also observed in the root hairs. The identity of Plasmodiophora brassicae Woronin was confirmed by PCR using a modified method of Cao et al. 2007 (1). DNA from spores and slices of the galls of 14 different samples were extracted using DNeasy plant mini kit (QIAGEN Australia) as per manufacturer's instructions. Samples were disrupted by placing them into MPBIO tube A and placed in the Fast Prep machine at speed of 6 ms-1 for 40 s. This was repeated twice. The species-specific primers TC1F (5'-GTGGTCGAACTTCATTAAATTTGGGCTCTT-3')/TC1R (5'-TTCACCTACGGAACGTATATGTGCATGTGA-3') and TC2F (5'-AAACAACGAGTCAGCTTGAATGCTAGTGTG-3')/TC2R (5'-CTTTAGTTGTGTTTCGGCTAGGATGGTTCG-3') were used (1). The primers TC1F and TC1R failed to produce a PCR product of 548-bp size but using the primers TC2F and TC2R the PCR reaction resulted in a 519- bp fragment. Seven out of 14 samples gave positive results for P. brassicae with primers TC2F and TC2R. This indicates that the P. brassicae pathotype from Western Australia may be different than the one found in Alberta, Canada. However, pathotypes of P. brassicae from brassica vegetables from Australia have been found similar to the populations of P. brassicae present in the United States (2). Pathogenicity of P. brassicae was tested by dipping roots of five 10-day-old canola plants var. Cobbler in a spore suspension (1 × 106 resting spores/ml). Roots of five control plants were dipped in sterile water. Five weeks after inoculation, small galls were observed on the roots of three inoculated plants and the control plants remained symptomless. Resting spores were recovered from the galls developed on the roots of affected plants. Presence of P. brassicae in the affected roots was further confirmed by PCR using the method described above. To our knowledge, this is the first report of club root of canola in Australia. Club root is reported from vegetable brassicas and white mustard (Sinapis alba L.) in Australia. Club root has become a serious disease of canola in Canada since its detection in Alberta in 2006 (3). The resting spores of the fungus can survive for several years in soil, and therefore, this disease could pose a significant threat to canola production in Western Australia.

15192,UV-mediated enhancement of antibacterial secondary metabolites in endophytic Lasiodiplodia theobromae,"In the science of drug discovery, ultraviolet (UV) irradiation has been applied to induce mutagenesis in fungi to provide possibilities for the stimulation or enhancement of fungal biosynthetic capabilities. This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of UV radiation on the biosynthesis of antibacterial secondary metabolites in an endophytic Lasiodiplodia theobromae. Using standard methods, the fungus was isolated from healthy leaves of Cola acuminata and identified based on PCR amplification and genomic sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Cultures of L. theobromae were exposed to UV radiation at different time intervals of 1, 2 and 5 min. The fungus was subjected to solid-state fermentation in rice medium before and after UV treatments. The fungal secondary metabolites were extracted and tested for antibacterial activity using the agar diffusion method. Compounds present in the obtained extracts were identified by HPLC and GC-MS analysis. At a concentration of 1 mg/ml, the extract of the wild type L. theobromae (untreated) was observed to only inhibit Staphylococcus aureus, with an IZD of 12 mm. However, the extract of UV-treated L. theobromae (2 min) inhibited S. aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with an IZD of 10 and 4 mm respectively. A wide array of compounds in the phenolics, fatty acids, alkaloids and alkanes classes were identified in the UV-treated and untreated fungal extracts. Overall, UV treatments of L. theobromae stimulated the production of seventeen (17) new compounds that were not detected in the untreated strain. The study confirms UV irradiation as an effective method for stimulating microbial biosynthesis of new bioactive compounds, indicating a promising and potentially abundant source of new drug compounds from microorganisms. © Articles by the authors.",Nwobodo D.C.; Ugwu M.C.; Eze P.M.; Okezie U.M.; Okoye F.B.C.; Esimone C.O.,Notulae Scientia Biologicae,2022,10.55779/nsb14411284,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98986648481175,TRUE,2,15,Low,not detected,isolated; medium; agar; pcr; sequencing; ITS; observed; tested,UV treatments of L. theobromae stimulated the production of seventeen (17) new compounds that were not detected in the untreated strain.

16784,First Report of Anthracnose Stem Canker of the Invasive Perennial Weed Lepidium draba Caused by Colletotrichum higginsianum in Europe.,"Exotic perennial Lepidium draba, native to Eurasia, is an invasive weed in dense stands in rangelands and disturbed areas in several states of the western United States and an agricultural weed in the prairie provinces of Canada. To determine strategies, such as a potential multipathogen strategy (1), for biological control of the weed, surveys that included the native range were conducted in spring 2009 to detect diseases that occur on this weed. Several stunted and chlorotic plants were found scattered throughout a stand of L. draba growing in a vacant lot near Riddes, Switzerland (46°08'22.99″N, 7°9'19.02″E): ( http://maps.google.com/maps?source=earth&ll=46.13983490,7.15503250&layer= c&cbll=46.13983490,7.15503250&cbp=1,360,,0,5 ). Affected plants had reddish brown cankers on the lower stems, usually elongated and irregular in shape and slightly sunken. Insect injury was associated with the cankers. Symptoms often occurred on plants that were also infected with Rhizoctonia solani. After surface disinfestation with 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, tissue adjacent to and including lesions were plated on acidified potato dextrose agar and incubated at 20 to 25°C for 1 week. Zonate, dark gray colonies with sparse mycelia resulted that exhibited abundant, faintly pink spore masses with numerous dense clusters of black setae. Spores were single celled, hyaline, cylindrical to oval shaped, and 13.5 to 19.5 × 4 to 5.5 μm. Setae were 1- to 3-septate and 20 to 42 × 3 to 5 μm. These morphological traits correspond to Colletotrichum higginsianum. For pathogenicity tests, three 4-month-old L. draba plants were sprayed until runoff with a 106 conidia/ml suspension of the fungus and incubated for 72 h in plastic bags at 20 to 25°C in a quarantine greenhouse. Within 4 days, water-soaked lesions appeared that coalesced, resulting in chlorosis and collapse of inoculated leaves. Such symptoms are typical of infection by C. higginsianum and similar necrotrophic species (4). Fungi isolated from inoculated leaves were identified as C. higginsianum. To assess the host range of C. higginsianum, three plants each of turnip, radish, mustard greens, kale, broccoli raab, and Chinese cabbage, all in the Brassicaceae to which L. draba belongs, were inoculated with the same conditions used for the pathogenicity tests. Control plants in pathogenicity and host range tests were sprayed with sterile distilled water and all experiments were repeated at least once. All control plants were symptomless. Leaf necrosis occurred on radish and turnip and to a lesser extent on the lower leaves of Chinese cabbage and broccoli; numerous scattered dark necrotic flecks and small grayish leaf spots occurred on kale and mustard greens, respectively. These results are similar to previous studies (2,3) involving a cultivated species as the host in the field. The ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2 sequences of this fungus (GenBank No. HM044877) were 99% similar to sequences of multiple isolates of C. higginsianum (GenBank Nos. AB042302, AB042303, AB455253, AJ558109, and AJ558110). To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. higginsianum on a wild species of the Brassicaceae, although a Colletotrichum sp. was reported on wild radish in Australia (1). References: (1) A.

17153,First Report on the Molecular Identification of Phytoplasma (16SrII-D) Associated with Witches' Broom of Kalmegh (Andrographis paniculata) in India.,"Andrographis paniculata (family Acanthaceae), also known as ""King of Bitters"" or Kalmegh, is an important medicinal plant used for the treatment of various diseases. It has antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, antidiabetic, antihyperglycemic, and antioxidant properties (1). During June 2014, while performing a routine survey of the commercial trial fields of Kalmegh at Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP), Lucknow, India, typical phytoplasma disease symptoms such as virescence, proliferation, and witches' broom along with little leaf and stunted growth were observed. The disease incidence was estimated to be approximately 7 to 10%. To ascertain the presence of phytoplasma, 16 samples of leaves were collected from nine different field sites, and total genomic DNA was extracted from the symptomatic and symptomless Kalmegh plants by the CTAB method. Direct and nested PCR assays were performed targeting the 16S rDNA using generic phytoplasma primer pairs P1/P6 followed by R16F2n/R16R2 (2). Resulting bands of the expected size (1.5 kb and 1.2 kb, respectively) were amplified from symptomatic plants. No amplification was observed with DNA from asymptomatic plant samples. The purified nested PCR products were cloned into E. coli DH5α, using the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, United States) and sequenced with primers M13For/M13Rev using an automatic sequencer (ABI Prism, Perkin Elmer) at CIMAP. The sequence was analyzed by BLASTn and found to share 99% similarity with Echinacea witches'-broom phytoplasma and Sesame phyllody phytoplasma strain (GenBank Accession Nos. JF340080 and KF612966, respectively), which belong to the 16SrII-D group. The sequence was deposited in NCBI as GenBank Accession No. KM359410. A phylogenetic tree using MEGA v5.0 (4) was constructed with 16S rDNA; consensus sequences of phytoplasmas belonging to distinct groups revealed that the present phytoplasma clustered with the 16SrII group. iPhyClassifier software was used to perform sequence comparison and generate a virtual restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) profile (5). On the basis of iPhyClassifier, the 16S rDNA sequence analysis of our isolate showed 99.2% similarity with that of the 'Candidatus Phytoplasma australasiae' reference strain (GenBank Accession No. Y10097), which belongs to 16Sr group II. The virtual RFLP pattern of F2n/R2 fragment was most similar to the 16SrII-D subgroup (similarity coefficient of 0.91) but showed a difference in profile with HpaI, HhaI, and MseI enzymes. Several bacterial/fungal and viral diseases have been reported on A. paniculata (3); however, to our knowledge, this is the first report of witches' broom disease in India and the first record of a 16SrII-D group phytoplasma on Kalmegh. Its presence in Kalmegh is of great significance due to its commercial interest. References: (1) S. Akbar. Altern. Med. Rev. 16:1, 2011. (2) D. E. Gundersen and M. Lee. Phytopathol.

14505,First report of Colletotrichum tropicale causing anthracnose on the wild cassava species Manihot dichotoma and M. epruinosa in Brazil,"Wild species of Manihot are valuable genetic reservoirs for cassava breeding, since they could carry new traits, such as resistance to destructive pests or high protein content (Alves et al. 2014). In February 2014, necrotic and irregular shaped spots on leaves and sunken lesions on the fruit and stems were observed in the Brazilian Wild Cassava Germplasm Collection (located at Embrapa Mandioca e Fruticultura, Cruz das Almas, Brazil). A total of 10 isolates of Colletotrichum sp. were obtained from infected leaves, and three strains were randomly selected (PPAM02, PPAM03, and PPAM05) for further characterization. The isolates grew on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and synthetic nutrient-poor agar (SNA) medium at 25°C and 12-h photoperiod. After 7 days on PDA, the colonies were white to gray on the upper surface and orange to gray on the reverse side. On SNA, conidia (n = 50) were cylindrical to subcylindrical, rarely clavate, hyaline and guttulate, with 12.6 to 19.8 (avg. 16.9) × 4.4 to 6.3 (avg. 5.5) µm. Conidial length/width ratio was 2.4 to 4.1 (avg. 3.1). The sexual stage was not observed and setae were rarely present. The morphological characteristics were compatible with species from the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex (Weir et al. 2012) commonly reported on Manihot esculenta. Pathogenicity was confirmed under controlled conditions on whole plants and detached cassava leaves. Both detached and undetached leaves were inoculated by placing a 5 mm plug of PDA from sporulating colonies on either nonwounded or tissue wounded with sterilized needle, with 10 replicates per treatment. Both were incubated in a moist chamber at 25°C and symptoms appeared in wounded tissue after 3 days. No symptoms were observed on controls inoculated with a sterile PDA plug. The isolate recovered from the inoculations showed the same morphological characteristics as the inoculated isolate, and the PPAM 02 was deposited in the CMM collection from the Universidade Federal Rural de Pernambuco, under accession number CMM 3957. Fungal DNA was extracted by CTAB protocol (Murray and Thompson 1980) and partial sequences of GAPDH, CHS-1, and CAL genes (Weir et al. 2012) were generated. Sequences were used in a BLAST search against the GenBank database and were 99 to 100% similar to C. tropicale. Phylogenetic analyses were conducted based on neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference for each gene and the concatenated alignment. The generated sequences for the isolates PPAM02 (CAL: KP763671, CHS: KP763678, and GAPDH: KP763684), PPAM03 (GAPDH: KP763685), and PPAM05 (CAL: KP763672, CHS: KP763679, and GAPDH: KP763686) were more than 98% similar to the ex-type strain CBS: 124949 (CAL: JX009719, CHS: JX009870, and GAPDH: JX010007). The isolates PPAM02 and PPAM03 were isolated from the wild species M. epruinosa, whereas isolate PPAM05 was from M. dichotoma. All three isolates grouped to a clade that included the ex-type of C. tropicale in the phylogeny inferred from the concatenated data, and were therefore classified as C. tropicale. The C. tropicale originally described from Panama as an endophyte of cacao (Theobroma cacao) and associated with fruit rot on soursop (Annona muricata) (Rojas et al. 2010).

16724,Report of Root Rot Caused by Pythium F-Group on Hydroponically Grown Celery in South Africa.,"Celery (Apium graveolens) is commonly grown in hydroponic systems in South Africa. During the warm summer months, plants often become stunted or die, with mortality as high as 70% in some systems. Affected plants show severe root rot and yellowing of the foliage. Root segments excised from symptomatic celery plants collected from various hydroponic systems in Gauteng Province, South Africa, were rinsed in sterile distilled water and plated on PARP medium (2). Pythium was isolated consistently from both rotted and symptomless roots. Isolates produced only noninflated filamentous sporangia and no oospores, conforming to the description of Pythium F-group (1). Koch's postulates were confirmed by inoculating 4-week-old celery seedlings cultivated in aerated nutrient solution in a hydroculture system in the greenhouse. A zoospore suspension (105 zoospores per ml) of Pythium F-group cultured on V8 juice agar was added to the nutrient solution at the rate of 3 ml/1iter. Control plants received no inoculum, and the experiment was repeated once. Plants were assessed after 4 weeks. All inoculated plants showed symptoms of root rot, stunting, and yellowing, whereas control plants remained healthy. Pythium F-group was recovered on PARP medium only from the roots of inoculated plants. Pythium F-group has been described as a pathogen of celery elsewhere, but to our knowledge, this is the first report of root rot caused by the fungus on celery in South Africa. References: (1) M. W.

Maize seedlings grown in an agar medium were inoculated with Ent. gergoviae strains containing the green fluorescent protein reporter gene. Root colonization and expression of the dinitrogenase reductase gene (nifH) by Ent. gergoviae were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. gfp-tagged Ent. gergoviae was observed to colonize predominantly in cortical aerenchyma of primary and lateral roots and in stellar parenchyma cells and xylem vessels of primary roots. In planta nifH :: gfp expression was not detected but after a constitutively expressed nifA gene was introduced into Ent. gergoviae. Enterobacter gergoviae 57-7 is an opportunistic endophyte because it can live in soil and colonize in maize roots in the gnotobiotic agar culture. In agreement with previous (15)N-dilution evidence that Ent. gergoviae 57-7 did not fix N(2) in association with maize in pots whereas a derivative E7 containing a constitutively expressed nifA gene promoted plant growth partly through associative nitrogen fixation, constitutive expression of the nifA gene can activate bacterial nif gene expression in planta.

16141,Diversity and bioactivity of endophytic fungi isolated from various fruit organs of Physalis angulata,"Physalis angulata plant is known by Indonesian people for its efficacy as a traditional medicine. The fruit is traditionally known as antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial. The efficacy of this fruit can also be obtained through its endophytic fungi isolated from parts organ of namely peduncle, calyx and pericarp all these aspects. The objective of this study was to isolate endophytic fungi from different organs of P. angulata fruit, namely peduncle, calyx and pericarp and determine the diversity, bioactivity and phytochemical content while comparing all aspects with the host. Endophytic fungi were isolated from peduncle, calyx and pericarp using sterile Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) media. The fungi were cultured on Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) for 4 weeks, then partitioned in ethyl acetate and evaporated using rotary evaporator. The host plant organs were macerated in methanol solvent and evaporated. The antioxidant activity was tested by the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) method, while the antibacterial activity tested by the Kirby-Bauer diffusion method. Potential compounds were analyzed using Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), then Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry/Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to determine the compounds contained in the extract. The results showed that a total of 18 fungal isolates were obtained from the plant, including 5 isolates from the peduncle (CT1-CT5), 7 isolates from the calyx (EP1-EP7), and 6 isolates from the pericarp (BP1-BP6) which were belonged to 11 genera. Aspergillus was the dominant fungus as it was obtained from the peduncle, calyx and pericarp. The overall bioactivity of endophytic fungi was better than its host. Antibacterial and antioxidant activities were not comparable, some extracts had weak antibacterial but strong antioxidants. Isolate CT5-(Diaporthe sp.) was selected for LC-MS/MS analysis because it showed very strong activity.

14381,First report of anthracnose of Mangifera indica caused by Colletotrichum siamense in Sanya city in China,"Mango, Mangifera indica L., is an economically important fruit tree in many tropical and subtropical countries, and is widely grown in South China. In 2001, an unknown disease occurred on mango in Sanya city (18°28′35″N, 109°29′21″E), Hainan Province, China, causing severe economic losses. Symptoms first appeared on fruits as small black spots (up to 5 mm diam.), with red to pink haloes that in advanced stages gradually attenuated or disappeared. Multiple spots sometimes coalesced, resulting in the formation of large, irregular, scabrous, black-brown fruit lesions. Infections also occurred on leaves and peduncles. Diseased tissue pieces were soaked in 75% ethanol for 10 s, followed by a 2 min soak in 1% HgCl2, rinsing with sterile water, and plating onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates. After 7 days incubation at 25°C, isolates TN1 and GM were purified from plates by single spore isolation. Conidial suspensions (105 spores ml-1) from 7-day-old PDA plates of the isolates were used to inoculate the entire surface of attached and detached immature fruits using a sterilized paintbrush. Six fruits were inoculated for each isolate, and incubated at 28°C (detached) or ambient temperature (attached). Leaves and peduncles that were attached to plants were each wounded five times with a sterilized needle, and inoculated with mycelial plugs from the edge of 5-day-old PDA colonies, five replicates per tissue type. Symptoms appeared after 3 days and were similar to those observed on naturally infected plants. The uninoculated controls remained symptomless. Fungi with morphological characteristics of GM and TN1 were consistently reisolated from lesions. Colonies of isolates TNI and GM on PDA were whitish at first, but subsequently turned gray with concentric rings of acervuli from which saffron conidial masses developed under diurnal 12 h near-ultraviolet light at 25°C. Conidia were hyaline, unicellular, elongated-elliptical, or elongated-obovoid, and measured 12.2 to 16.7 (avg. 15) × 4.2 to 6.1 (avg. 5.2) μm. Ellipsoid (rarely lobed), chocolate-brown hyphopodia, 6.3 to 15.2 (avg. 10.9) × 5 to 11.4 (avg. 7.5) μm, developed from hyphal tips. Taupe appressoria developing on germ tubes of conidia were ovoid to clavate, and 5.6 to 9.1 (avg. 7.6) × 4.5 to 6.9 (avg. 5.5) μm. Morphological characteristics of the isolates agreed with the description of Colletotrichum siamense (Yang et al. 2009). The internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA and three genes (β-tubulin, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and actin) were sequenced from both isolates. Sequences were submitted to GenBank as accessions JF730185 to JF730192, and a concatenated tree was built using the ML method in MEGA6. Both isolates formed a clade with the ex-type strains of C. siamense, ICMP18642 and ICMP18574. C. siamense has been reported as a pathogen of mango anthracnose in Colombia (Pardo-De la Hoz et al. 2016), but this is the first report in China. Only three other Colletotrichum spp. (C. acutatum, C. asianum, and C. gloeosporiodes) have previously been reported as causing mango anthracnose in China (Hu et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2014).

13049,The effects of the endophytic fungus Ceratobasidum stevensii B6 on Fusarium oxysporum in a continuously cropped watermelon field,"Serious obstacles exist for the continuous cropping of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus). It has previously been shown that following application of living Ceratobasidum stevensii B6 mycelia, the quantity of Fusarium oxysporum (FO) in continuously cropped soil at the harvest stage decreased by 29. 9%, while the total yield and soluble sugar content of the fruit increased by 103. 8% and 35. 1% compared with the control. Here we further discuss the mechanisms by which B6 may alleviate watermelon cropping problems. We developed a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect and quantify B6 in soil, and monitored the dynamics of the FO population in the soil. We also evaluated the effects of different fermentation components on the soil microflora, using Denatured Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). B6- specific DNA primers were designed based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence. Amplification of B6 DNA using Cf1/ Cr1 primers yielded a single 371 bp-long product; no product was obtained in the other ten fungal species tested. The detection limit of the system was 100 fg/ μL of B6 genomic DNA. To replicate the watermelon cropping system as closely as possible, a surface layer (5-20 cm depth) of an Ultisol was sampled from a 3-year old continuously cropped upland watermelon site, at the Red Soil Experimental Station, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Yongzhou, Hunan Province (N26°45', E111°53'). Pot experiments were conducted in the botanical garden of Nanjing Normal University; these were a control (A), an inactivated B6 liquid broth (B), an activated B6 liquid broth (C), an inactivated B6 solid fermentation (D), and an activated B6 solid fermentation (E). When the solid fermentation of B6 was inoculated into soil, the level of genomic DNA reached its highest at 7. 4 log (pg/ g dry soil) after one week, but decreased below the detection limit after 5 weeks. When liquid broth of B6 was inoculated into soil, the level of genomic DNA decreased immediately, and was below the detection limit after 4 weeks. B6 was not detected in other treatments, meaning that B6 was low in the natural environment. The population of FO was effectively controlled by treatments C and E during the first 4 weeks (FO was about 5 ×103 CFU/ gDM), and then from the fifth week FO increased rapidly. DGGE fingerprinting of bacterial cluster analysis showed that treatments A and B clustered in one class (with 57. 5% similarity), and treatments C, D, and E clustered in another class (with 55. 2% similarity). DGGE fingerprinting of fungal cluster analysis showed that treatments A, B, and C clustered in one class (with 66. 0% similarity). Treatments D and E exhibited significant differences. Except for treatments C and E, there was little difference between the bacterial or fungal Shannon diversity indices, or evenness between the treatments. Our results suggest that B6 survived in the soil for about one month under these experimental conditions, and that the strain tested was environmentally friendly and interfered little with the soil microenvironment.",Xiao Y.; Dai C.; Wang X.; Liu F.; Wang H.,Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica,2012,10.5846/stxb201111021653,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.961061841783643,TRUE,2,14,Low,not detected,CFU; pcr; primers; ITS; DGGE; sampled; tested; monitored; evaluated,"genomic DNA decreased immediately, and was below the detection limit after 4 weeks.

The plants came from a variety of Yemeni locations. Endophytic fungus strains were isolated and identified using starch casein and potato dextrose agar medium. Methanol was used to extract the stem and leaves of the plants. The agar well diffusion method was used to test the antibacterial properties of the produced methanolic extracts against four Gram-negative bacteria, three Gram-positive bacteria, and one species of yeast. The IC50 values for the most promising extracts are calculated. The methanolic extracts were also subjected to a phytochemical screening by GC-Mass. A total of forty fungal endophyte isolates were isolated. Fusarium spp. (15), Phomaspp. (6), Alternaria alternata (5), White Sterile mycelia (6), Dark Sterile mycelia (6), Cochlioboluslunatus (1), and Mucor spp. (1). were found throughout the identification process. The highest yield extract was obtained from Jatropha variegate (45.4%), followed by Acokanthera schimperi (32.3%), and finally Ceropegia rupicola (20.5%). Only Gram-negative bacteria were found to have antibacterial activity, and the most effective extract was Acokanthera schimperi against the majority of microorganisms tested (8–18mm). The methanolic extracts of Jatropha variegate had the best antibacterial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 13883015, with a zone of inhibition (45 mm). Furthermore, Ceropegia rupicola extract had the highest inhibitory zone against Candida albicans ATCC 700012 (20mm). In addition, the IC50 results showed that the Jatropha variegate extract on A549 had an IC50 of 84.1ug/ml and a PC3 of 39.4ug/ml. The IC50 for Ceropegia rupicola extract was 49.4ug/ml in A549 cells and 34ug/ml in PC3 cells.

19291,"Non-rhizobial nodule endophytes improve nodulation, change root exudation pattern and promote the growth of lentil, for prospective application in fallow soil.","Non-rhizobial endophytes (NREs) are active colonizers inhabiting the root nodules. Though their active role in the lentil agroecosystem is not well defined, here we observed that these NREs might promote the growth of lentils, modulate rhizospheric community structure and could be used as promising organisms for optimal use of rice fallow soil. NREs from root nodules of lentils were isolated and examined for plant growth-promoting traits, exopolysaccharide (EPS) and biofilm production, root metabolites, and the presence of nifH and nifK elements. The greenhouse experiment with the chosen NREs, i.e., Serratia plymuthica 33GS and Serratia sp. R6 significantly increased the germination rate, vigour index, development of nodules (in non-sterile soil) and fresh weight of nodules (33GS 94%, R6 61% growth) and length of the shoot (33GS 86%, R6 51.16%) as well as chlorophyll levels when compared to the uninoculated control. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) revealed that both isolates could successfully colonize the roots and elicit root hair growth. The inoculation of the NREs resulted in specific changes in root exudation patterns. The plants with 33GS and R6 treatment significantly stimulated the exudation of triterpenes, fatty acids, and their methyl esters in comparison to the uninoculated plants, altering the rhizospheric microbial community structure. Proteobacteria dominated the rhizospheric microbiota in all the treatments. Treatment with 33GS or R6 also enhanced the relative abundance of other favourable microbes, including Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, and Bradyrhizobium. The correlation network analysis of relative abundances resulted in numerous bacterial taxa, which were in cooperation with each other, having a possible role in plant growth promotion.

767,Dual inoculation of dark septate endophytes and Trichoderma viride drives plant performance and rhizosphere microbiome adaptations of Astragalus mongholicus to drought,"Rhizosphere microbiome adapts their structural compositions to water scarcity and have the potential to mitigate drought stress of plants. To unlock this potential, it is crucial to understand community responses to drought in the interplay between soil properties, water management and exogenous microbes interference. Inoculation with dark septate endophytes (DSE) (Acrocalymma vagum, Paraboeremia putaminum) and Trichoderma viride on Astragalus mongholicus grown in the non-sterile soil was exposed to drought. Rhizosphere microbiome were assessed by Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S and ITS2 rRNA genes. Inoculation positively affected plant growth depending on DSE species and water regime. Ascomycota, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Firmicutes were the dominant phyla. The effects of dual inoculation on bacterial community were greater than those on fungal community, and combination of P. putaminum and T. viride exerted a stronger impact on the microbiome under drought stress. The observed changes in soil factors caused by inoculation could be explained by the variations in microbiome composition.

16107,Diversity and seasonal variation of fungal endophytes associated with Ageratum conyzoides L.: an invasive species,"Fungal endophytes are important yet an underexplored group of microbial organisms that colonize healthy living plant tissues without developing any visible symptoms of disease. These microbes engage in a crucial role in the successful population establishment of alien invasive species in introduced ranges by altering native community structures. Thus, the present work was aimed to isolate and document the endophytic fungi associated with Ageratum conyzoides, an invasive plant species of Tripura, North-east, India, by selecting different vegetative parts viz. leaf, stem and roots, taking into consideration tissue type, sampling sites and season. For the isolation of fungal endophytes, selected explants of vegetative parts of A. conyzoides were inoculated in the MEA (Malt Extract Agar) medium. During this study from eight sampling sites, a total of 480 segments were inoculated, altogether 283 isolates were identified using morphology, microscopic, and molecular characteristics. The maximum number of endophytes were recovered from the stem (101 isolates) and leaf (99 isolates) segments compared to the root (83 isolates) segments. Twenty-two (22) endophytic fungal strains were identified among which nineteen (19) genera belonged to Ascomycota, one (1) in Mucoromycota, and the rest were sterile forms.

To date, studies of B. bassiana have focused on its insecticidal mechanism, symbiosis with plants and antagonism of plant pathogens; however, few studies of its influence on the microecological phyllosphere and at physiological level of the plant have been conducted. To investigate the ecological security of B. bassiana in the paddy phyllosphere, we evaluated the effects of different concentrations of B. bassiana spore suspensions and a chemical pesticide (acephate) on paddy phyllosphere microbial flora and protective enzyme activities by a potted trial. B. bassiana were then induced to express the egfp gene (green fluorescent protein gene) through transformation with a vector, after which real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to quantify the organisms and measure their dynamics in a paddy phyllosphere. We also evaluated the effects of different concentrations of B. bassiana suspensions on the phyllosphere microflora using DGGE. To accomplish this, B. bassiana specific DNA primers were designed based on the green fluorescent protein sequence marked B. bassiana. Amplification of B. bassiana DNA using the eGPF-F1/eGFP-R1 primers yielded a single 289bp-long product with a detection limit of 10fg/μL of B. bassiana genomic DNA. The pot experiments, which were conducted in the botanical garden of Nanjing Normal University, consisted of the following seven treatments: sterile water applied as a control (CK), inoculation with the larva of Chilo suppressalis (A), application of the B. bassiana spore suspension at 7.5×104spores/ml (B), 7.5×105 spores/ml (C), 7.5×106spores/ml (D), or 7.5×107 spores/ml (E), application of acephate emulsifiable concentrates (F). Each treatment group was covered with gauze (3 m × 0.7 m × 1.5 m) after treatment. Fluorescence quantitative PCR analysis of the rice phyllosphere DNA revealed that B. bassiana was maintained for at least 30 days on the leaves of paddy plants after application, but when a higher initial dosage of the B. bassiana was applied, the B. bassiana population on the phyllosphere decreased more rapidly. When compared with chemical pesticide, B. bassiana did not significantly affect the antioxidant activity of three enzymes in paddy leaves. Specifically, the enzymatic activities of SOD and POD in B. bassiana treatment groups were 20.38 and 8.65% higher, respectively, than those in the CK group on the tenth day, while the activity of CAT was 33.67% higher than that of the CK group on day 30. However, the enzymatic activity of CAT in the F group was 42.71% lower than that of the CK group on day 10. DGGE cluster analysis showed that B. bassiana did not significantly influence the bacterial or fungal community structures on the paddy phyllosphere, and the microbial community structure similarity, Shannon index and band number in the B. bassiana treated group were higher than in the negative control group. These results indicated that B. bassiana is an environmental friendly microbial pesticide. Future studies of B. bassiana should focus on its effects on other endophytes in plants. Studies to evaluate the role of B. bassiana could lead to a new paradigm on its successful use in biological control programs. © 2014, Ecological Society of China.

17576,First Report of Fusarium Stem and Crown Rot of Fennel in Arizona Caused by Fusarium avenaceum.,"In 2010 in Yuma, AZ, field-grown fennel (Foeniculum vulgare, Apiaceae) exhibited previously undescribed disease symptoms. The lower stems in contact with soil developed a brown decay and leaves on these stems became chlorotic. White mycelium and orange sporodochia were observed on affected tissues near the soil line. Diseased stems later wilted, died, and resulted in reduced quality of the fennel; these plants were not harvested. Disease distribution was patchy and prevalence was approximately 5%. Symptomatic tissues were surface sterilized in a dilute (1%) bleach solution for 3 min and tissues from the margins of the decay were placed into petri plates containing acidified corn meal agar (2 ml of 25% lactic acid/liter). Isolations consistently resulted in the recovery of a presumptive Fusarium species. Isolates were transferred to carnation leaf agar and incubated at 22°C under fluorescent lights for 10 days. Morphologies of all isolates were identical, with macroconidia being long and slender, slightly curved, with elongated, bent apical cells and notched basal cells. Conidia were borne on monophialides. Microconidia were sparse and chlamydospores were not observed. For two isolates, a portion of the translation elongation factor 1-alpha gene (TEF) was amplified with primers ef1 and ef2 (3). Based on a comparison of 668 base pairs, both isolates had the same sequence, which differed by one base pair from an accession (GQ915502.1) of Fusarium avenaceum in GenBank. The same single base pair also separated the two fennel isolates from an isolate of F. avenaceum (GL 13) previously recovered from Eustoma grandiflorum (=Lisianthus russellianus) (2). Thus, both morphological and molecular criteria support identification of the recovered fungus as F. avenaceum (Fries) Saccardo. Partial TEF sequences were deposited in GenBank (Accession Nos. JN254784, JN254785, and JN254786 for the two fennel isolates and GL 13, respectively). All isolates are archived in the Department of Plant Pathology at University of California, Davis. Pathogenicity was tested by cutting shallow slits into fennel stems, inserting one colonized agar plug into each cut, and wrapping the stems with Parafilm. Five isolates from fennel were tested on 10 stems each. Control plants were inoculated with uncolonized agar plugs. Plants were maintained at 24 to 26°C in a greenhouse. After 6 to 8 days, a brown decay developed on 70 to 90% of Fusarium-inoculated stems at the points of inoculation. Foliage later became chlorotic and F. avenaceum was recovered from all symptomatic stems. Control plants were symptomless. The experiment was completed two times and results were the same. In addition, F. avenaceum isolate GL13 from E. grandiflorum (2) was inoculated onto fennel plants with the same method. However, these inoculated plants remained symptomless. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a stem and crown rot disease of fennel caused by F. avenaceum. Apparently, the only other published account of a Fusarium disease of fennel is root rot caused by F. solani (1). The inability of the Eustoma isolate of F. avenaceum to cause disease in fennel suggests that these two crown rot pathogens may have restricted host ranges. References: (1) J. H. Gupta and V. P.

1022,Double lives: transfer of fungal endophytes from leaves to woody substrates,"Fungal endophytes are a ubiquitous feature of plants, yet for many fungi the benefits of endophytism are still unknown. The Foraging Ascomycete (FA) hypothesis proposes that saprotrophic fungi can utilize leaves both as dispersal vehicles and as resource havens during times of scarcity. The presence of saprotrophs in leaf endophyte communities has been previously observed but their ability to transfer to non-foliar saprobic substrates has not been well investigated. To assess this ability, we conducted a culture study by placing surface-sterilized leaves from a single tropical angiosperm tree (Nectandra lineatifolia) directly onto sterile wood fragments and incubating them for 6 weeks. Fungi from the wood were subsequently isolated in culture and identified to the genus level by ITS sequences or morphology. Four-hundred and seventy-seven fungal isolates comprising 24 taxa were cultured from the wood. Of these, 70.8% of taxa (82.3% of isolates) belong to saprotrophic genera according to the FUNGuild database. Furthermore, 27% of OTUs (6% of isolates) were basidiomycetes, an unusually high proportion compared to typical endophyte communities. Xylaria flabelhformis, although absent in our original isolations, formed anamorphic fruiting structures on the woody substrates. We introduce the term viaphyte (literally, ""by way of plant"") to refer to fungi that undergo an interim stage as leaf endophytes and, after leaf senescence, colonize other woody substrates via hyphal growth. Our results support the FA hypothesis and suggest that viaphytism may play a significant role in fungal dispersal.","Nelson, A; Vandegrift, R; Carroll, GC; Roy, BA",PEERJ,2020,10.7717/peerj.9341,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.969888242630956,TRUE,2,13,Low,sterile,cultured; isolated; culture; sterile; ITS; observed; investigated,study by placing surface-sterilized leaves from a single tropical angiosperm tree (Nectandra lineatifolia) directly onto sterile wood fragments and incubating them for 6 weeks.

4430,Initial stages of endophytic colonization by Metarhizium involves rhizoplane colonization,"Here we assessed the time course of rhizoplane colonization by the endophytic insect pathogenic fungus Metarhizium robertsii. We describe a method of quantifying root colonization of bean plants by M. robertsii using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results of this method were compared to the standard plate count method using colony-forming units (c.f.u.). Both the c.f.u. and qPCR methods were used to monitor the time-course of haricot bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) colonization by a strain of M. robertsii that expresses the green fluorescent protein (ARSEF 2575-GFP) for colony verification. There was a strong correlation between the results of the c.f.u. and qPCR methods, indicating that both methods are well suited for the determination of colonization of P. vulgaris roots by M. robertsii. Primers for a catalase gene (cat) amplified DNA from M. robertsii, M. brunneum and M. guizhouense. Primers for a nitrogen response-regulator (nrr) additionally detected M. acridum and M. flavoviride, whereas Metarhizium perilipin-like protein (mpl) primers were specific to M. robertsii alone. However, cat was the only target that specifically amplified Metarhizium in experiments utilizing non-sterile soil. Endophytic colonization of P. vulgaris at 60 days post-inoculation with M. robertsii was detected from surface-sterilized roots with more sensitivity using our qPCR technique over the c.f.u. method. Our results suggest that there is a prolonged period of rhizoplane colonization by Metarhizium with transient, low-level endophytic colonization of the root system of P. vulgaris that persists for the entirety of the plant life cycle.","Barelli, L; Moreira, CC; Bidochka, MJ",MICROBIOLOGY-SGM,2018,10.1099/mic.0.000729,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.807444025893018,TRUE,2,13,Low,sterile,colony; sterile; plate count; amplified; primers; qpcr; assessed,NA,"by a strain of M. robertsii that expresses the green fluorescent protein (ARSEF 2575-GFP) for colony verification.

937,"Extensive sampling and high-throughput sequencing reveal Posidoniomyces atricolor gen. et sp. nov. (Aigialaceae, Pleosporales) as the dominant root mycobiont of the dominant Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica","Seagrasses provide invaluable ecosystem services yet very little is known about their root mycobiont diversity and distribution. Here we focused on the dominant Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica and assessed its root mycobiome at 32 localities covering most of the ecoregions in the NW Mediterranean Sea using light and scanning electron microscopy and tag-encoded 454-pyrosequencing. Microscopy revealed that the recently discovered dark septate endophytic association specific for P. oceanica is present at all localities and pyrosequencing confirmed that the P. oceanica root mycobiome is dominated by a single undescribed pleosporalean fungus, hitherto unknown from other hosts and ecosystems. Its numerous slow-growing isolates were obtained from surface-sterilised root segments at one locality and after prolonged cultivation, several of them produced viable sterile mycelium. To infer their phylogenetic relationships we sequenced and analysed the large (LSU) and small (SSU) subunit nrDNA, the ITS nrDNA and the DNA-directed RNA polymerase II (RPB2). The fungus represents an independent marine biotrophic lineage in the Aigialaceae (Pleosporales) and is introduced here as Posidoniomyces atricolor gen. et sp. nov. Its closest relatives are typically plantassociated saprobes from marine, terrestrial and freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia and Central America.

2314,Culture of the upper littoral zone marine alga Pseudendoclonium submarinum induces pathogenic interaction with the fungus Cladosporium cladosporioides,"The green marine alga Pseudendoclonium submarinum (Willie 1901) occurs on hard substratum in the upper littoral in the North Atlantic Ocean. In recent field and laboratory studies, Pseudendoclonium submarinum grew normally in situ but declined in vitro. Microscopic examination showed the alga inoculum to be associated with a filamentous fungus, where the fungus grew in close association with the alga. Pseudendoclonium samples collected from Ipswich, MA during a two-year period were consistently associated with the fungus. In cultures with the fungus present, algal thalli declined and became necrotic, while the fungus produced hyphae and conidia. The fungus failed to grow in sterile algal medium in the absence of Pseudendoclonium but could be isolated and grown on standard mycological culture media. Light and scanning electron microscopy showed fungal hyphae infiltrated intercellular areas of the algal filaments but did not penetrate algal cell walls. Pathogenicity is apparently a result of the in vitro environment, and it is hypothesized that the fungus produces one or more secondary metabolites, which accumulate in culture. These metabolites produced by the fungus eventually killed algal cells. Fungal ribosomal DNA sequences were compared to Cladasporium sp. in GenBank, indicating that the fungus is Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fresenius) de Vries. Widely distributed, Cladosporium cladasporioides has been shown to be a facultative parasite, endophyte and saprophyte on terrestrial plants and some algae.

16978,"First Report of Botrytis Gray Mold on Common Calla Lily in Buenos Aires, Argentina.","Common calla lily (Zantedeschia aethiopica (L.) Spreng., family Araceae) is an evergreen herbaceous South African ornamental plant that forms a tuft of fleshy-stalked, glossy, dark green leaves. At bloom during the summertime, large, funnel-shaped, waxy-white spaths that surround a bright yellow spadix form at the end of high stalks. In August 2003, large, irregular brown spots with a 3- to 4-mm yellow halo were observed on leaves of 10 plants growing near Japanese quince shrubs (Chaenomeles lagenaria (Loisel.) Koidz.) in Escobar, Buenos Aires. Debris of Japanese quince petals were attached to the center of the lesions with profuse sporulation of Botrytis cinerea Pers. (1). Pathogen spores were disposed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 22°C. Mycelium was initially whitish and turned gray with age. Black conidiophores bore botryose heads of hyaline, ellipsoid, unicellular conidia, gray in mass, 7.5 to 10.5 μm × 6.8 to 7.5 (average 9.2 to 7 μm). Black, irregular sclerotia formed at random in culture. Inoculum was prepared from 7-day-old cultures on PDA. Six flowering common calla lilies planted in 5-liter plastic pots were inoculated by spraying a suspension of 2.5 × 106 conidia per ml of sterile distilled water. Six healthy plants were sprayed with sterile distilled water. Each plant was covered with a transparent polyethylene bag for 3 days and kept at 21°C under a 12-h photoperiod. After a 12-day incubation period, leaves showed elliptic to irregular brown spots surrounded by yellow halos. Tiny round to irregular brown spots developed on flower spaths that finally blighted. Water-treated plants remained symptomless. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by pathogen reisolation from diseased organs. To our knowledge, this is the first report of B. cinerea on Z. aethiopica in Argentina. Infection efficiency of B. cinerea increases when inoculated petals are positioned on leaves (2), which has epidemiological importance in landscapes with association of plant species that are potential hosts of this pathogen.

16794,"First Report of Colletotrichum boninense, C. capsici, and a Glomerella sp. as Causes of Postharvest Anthracnose of Passion Fruit in Florida.","Anthracnose is an important foliar and fruit disease of passion fruit, Passiflora spp. (3). In 2008, postharvest anthracnose on purple and yellow passion fruits (P. edulis Sims and P. edulis f. flavicarpa O. Degner, respectively) from a commercial planting in Miami-Dade County, FL was examined. Lesions began as light brown areas that became papery, covered much of the fruit surface, and developed pink-to-dark sporulation. Single-conidium isolates from lesions were examined morphologically and with internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Four taxa were identified: Colletotrichum boninense (GenBank No. GU045516) with felted cream-to-orange colonies and cylindrical conidia; C. capsici (synonym C. truncatum [2]) (GU045515) with sparse, white mycelia, setose acervuli, and falcate conidia; C. gloeosporioides with fluffy white-to-gray colonies and straight, cylindrical conidia; and a Glomerella sp. (GU045517) with darkly pigmented perithecia. In two experiments, four mature, yellow passion fruit were wounded at a single equatorial site with a sterile needle and inoculated with a 15-μl drop of 0.3% water agar that did not contain (noninoculated control) or contained 105 conidia per ml of representative isolates from each taxon. After 21 days at 25°C without light, anthracnose incidence was recorded and the presence of the isolates was confirmed by their recovery from lesion margins on potato dextrose agar. Anthracnose did not develop on noninoculated control fruit. Mean incidences of anthracnose exceeded 50% for isolates of C. boninense (three from passion fruit), C. capsici (two from passion fruit), and a Glomerella sp. (two from passion fruit and one each from papaya and eugenia). Despite its common indictment as a causal agent of anthracnose on passion fruit (3), symptoms developed on only one fruit that was inoculated with an isolate of C. gloeosporioides from passion fruit (13%) and did not develop after inoculation with an isolate from papaya. Work is needed to determine whether host-specific populations of C. gloeosporioides exist on passion fruit that were not assessed during this study or whether the pathogen was misidentified in previous reports on this host. C. boninense was associated previously with postharvest anthracnose of passion fruit in Japan and Colombia, whereas C. capsici was associated with leaf anthracnose of passion fruit in Florida and Japan (4); both species are reported here for the first time as causes of postharvest anthracnose of passion fruit in Florida. Glomerella sp. caused darkly pigmented lesions and produced the teleomorph on symptomatic passion fruit and in single-ascospore cultures. Isolates with ITS sequences that are 99% homologous to those from passion fruit have been recovered in South Florida from eugenia, papaya, and Piper betle (4) and from other locations on several other hosts (GenBank); they are often nonpathogenic endophytes. Almeida and Coêlho (1) reported in Brazil a Glomerella sp. that formed the teleomorph in culture and caused anthracnose on passion fruit, but did not provide ITS sequences. Additional work is warranted on the identity and ecology of these fungi. References: (1) L. C. C. Almeida and R. S. B. Coêlho. Fitopatol. Bras. 32:318, 2007. (2) U. Damm et al.

From 180 root segments, 220 fungal isolates were recovered that belonged to 31 filamentous fungal species (19 Deuteromycetes, six Ascomycetes and six sterile fungi). Plating consistently yielded more fungal isolates as well as species than damp incubation. Chaetomium globosum and Torula caligans were more frequently recovered on MEA, and Fusarium sp. after damp incubation. Among the endophytes 13% belonged to marine fungal taxa (Monodictys pelagica, Periconia prolifica, Verruculina enalia and Zalerion maritimum). Even though arenicolous fungi have adapted to coastal sand dune ecosystem, none of them were recovered as root endophytes. A maximum of 21 and up to seven fungal species per segment were recorded from I. pes-caprae. Based on the rarefaction index, the expected number of species was higher in I. pes-caprae as compared to other two plant species. In this pilot trial Acremonium was extensively isolated. Endophytic Acremonium is known to decrease the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal colonisation and reproduction, but there seem to be no such effects on coastal sand dune plant species studied.","Beena, KR; Ananda, K; Sridhar, KR",SYDOWIA,2000,NA,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.968653047261351,TRUE,2,12,Low,sterile,isolated; agar; sterile; MEA; examined; examined; studied,"were recovered that belonged to 31 filamentous fungal species (19 Deuteromycetes, six Ascomycetes and six sterile fungi).

10958,"Mycena sp., a mycorrhizal fungus of the orchid Dendrobium officinale","An endophytic fungus, F-23, was isolated from the roots of Dendrobium officinale Kimura et Migo, an endangered Chinese medicinal plant. The sequence of the ITS region indicated that the isolate belongs to the genus Mycena. After 4 months of inoculation, the root systems of D. officinale that were inoculated with F-23 fungus were much larger than the control's root systems. We also observed that the hyphae of F-23 penetrated the epidermal cells within the host's roots and spread from cell to cell. A large number of pelotons existed in the root cortical cells of D. officinale inoculated with F-23 fungus. Intracellular hyphae crossing through the host walls were also observed using SEM (scanning electron microscopy). In contrast, light microscopy and SEM showed that the transverse sections of the roots of control plants remained uncolonized. Therefore, the F-23 fungus can form mycorrhizal associations with the roots of its host plant, D. officinale, and enhance the growth of seedlings and roots. In brief, Mycena sp. was identified and shown to be a mycorrhizal fungus of the epiphytic orchid, D. officinale. This might be of potential use to the mass cultivation of D. officinale under artificial conditions.","Zhang, LC; Chen, J; Lv, YL; Gao, C; Guo, SX",MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS,2012,10.1007/s11557-011-0754-1,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.964812303133434,TRUE,2,12,Low,uncolonized,isolated; ITS; microscopy; observed; light microscopy; electron microscopy,NA,"An endophytic fungus, F-23, was isolated from the roots of Dendrobium officinale Kimura et Migo, an endangered Chinese medicinal plant.

19966,Molecular diversity of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi,"Using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns from two ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS) and DNA sequences from ITS2, we characterized ericoid mycorrhizal fungal isolates from culture collections.With a synoptic key to RFLP patterns, we divided 34 mycorrhizal or root-associated isolates into 16 groups. RFLP patterns were identical when fungal specific primers were used to amplify DNA from pure fungal cultures and in vitro mycorrhizae. Sequence analysis clustered 23 of 24 mycorrhizal isolates into two larger groups: the Oidiodendron group and the Hymenoscyphus group. The Oidiodendron group included genetically uniform, conidiating fungi. The Hymenoscyphus group encompassed more diversity and included other discomycetes (Leotiales) as well as sterile, unidentifiable mycorrhizal isolates from four RFLP groups. Results from our field site on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, suggest that several ericoid mycorrhizal fungi can coexist in a single root of Gaultheria shallon Pursh and that our molecular data base is not yet complete.

During the spring of 2004 and 2005, necrotic lesions were observed in the middle of leaf blades and near prickles on 2- to 5-year-old, container-grown sandpaper sotol plants from two nurseries in eastern Sicily (Italy). Symptoms were detected on 20 to 30% of plants and consisted of reddish lesions that developed a reddish brown stripe surrounded by a yellow halo. As lesions enlarged, the center turned yellow and expanded rapidly causing blight of young leaves. Occasionally, symptomatic tissues had masses of gray fungal conidia and/or sclerotia. Botrytis cinerea was isolated consistently from infected tissues disinfected for 1 min in 1% NaOCl and rinsed in sterile distilled water and grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Hyaline, ovoid conidia (average 6.4 × 9.7 μm) and conidiophores were similar to those described of B. cinerea, and 5- to 8-day-old cultures developed black sclerotia that were round or irregular in shape (average 1.55 × 1.02 mm) that is typical of gray mold (1). Koch's postulates were performed by spraying 6-week-old sandpaper sotol plants grown in 12-cm pots with a spore suspension (1 × 106 CFU per ml) obtained from 12-day-old cultures grown on PDA. Eight plants were naturally wounded by scratching leaf blades among themselves and were subsequently inoculated, while eight plants were inoculated without wounding. An equal number of noninoculated plants sprayed with sterile water served as controls. All plants were maintained in high humidity conditions (90 to 95% relative humidity) at 20 ± 2°C. Leaf spots similar to the ones observed in nurseries were evident on all naturally wounded and nonwounded plants within 2 to 3 weeks after inoculation. Noninoculated control plants were symptomless. B. cinerea was reisolated from affected tissues.

16949,Curvularia Blight on Lolium perenne on Turfgrasses in Argentina.,"Lolium perenne L. is commonly used alone or in association with blue-grass and fescues in sport fields, parks, and gardens. During 2003, symptoms of an unknown disease were observed on L. perenne turfgrass in western Buenos Aires. Initial symptoms were indefinite yellow and green dappled spots that extended downward from the leaf tip, turned brown and finally gray, causing leaf death. Segments of symptomatic leaf tissues were surface sterilized and placed on 2% potato dextrose agar in petri dishes. After 4 days at room temperature, blackish brown colonies developed with dark brown septate conidiophores. Conidia were 21 to 29 × 9 to 13 μm, 3-septa, curved at the third cell from the base that is longer and darker than the others. Cells at each end are subhyaline and intermediate cells are medium brown. These characteristics are consistent with Curvularia lunata (Wakker) Boedijng (1). Pathogenicity tests were performed in five plastic trays with substrate of natural soil and sand (1:1 [v/v]) where the turfgrass (L. perenne cv. El Cencerro) was seeded.

3977,Lipopeptide mediated biocontrol activity of endophytic Bacillus subtilis against fungal phytopathogens,"BackgroundThe use of chemical fungicides against fungal pathogens adversely affects soil and plant health thereby resulting in overall environmental hazards. Therefore, biological source for obtaining antifungal agents is considered as an environment-friendly alternative for controlling fungal pathogens.ResultsIn this study, seven endophytic bacteria were isolated from sugarcane leaves and screened for its antifungal activity against 10 fungal isolates belonging to the genera Alternaria, Cochliobolus, Curvularia, Fusarium, Neodeightonia, Phomopsis and Saccharicola isolated from diseased leaves of sugarcane. Among the seven bacterial isolates, SCB-1 showed potent antagonistic activity against the tested fungi. Based on the phenotypic data, Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME) and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the isolate SCB-1 was identified as Bacillus subtilis. The bacterial isolate was screened negative for chitinase production; however, chloroform and methanol extracts of the bacterial culture caused significant inhibition in the growth of the fungal isolates on semisolid media. Volatile component assay showed highest inhibitory activity against Saccharicola bicolor (SC1.4). A PCR based study detected the presence of the genes involved in biosynthesis of surfactin, bacillaene, difficidin, macrolactins and fengycin. Mass spectrometric analysis of the bacterial extract detected the presence of antifungal lipopeptide surfactin, but other metabolites were not detected. The biocontrol activity of the bacterial isolate was established when bacterial pretreated mung bean seeds were able to resist Fusarium infection, however, the untreated seeds failed to germinate.ConclusionThe antifungal potential of isolate Bacillus subtilis SCB-1 was established against taxonomically diverse fungal pathogens including the genera Saccharicola, Cochliobolus, Alternaria and Fusarium. The potent antifungal compound surfactin as well as volatiles produced by the bacterial isolate could be responsible for its bio-control activity against fungal infections.","Hazarika, DJ; Goswami, G; Gautom, T; Parveen, A; Das, P; Barooah, M; Boro, RC",BMC MICROBIOLOGY,2019,10.1186/s12866-019-1440-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.886732890680118,TRUE,2,12,Low,not detected,isolated; culture; pcr; rrna; ITS; screened; tested,NA,"considered as an environment-friendly alternative for controlling fungal pathogens.ResultsIn this study, seven endophytic bacteria were isolated from sugarcane leaves and screened for its antifungal activity against 10 fungal isolates belonging to | isolate was screened negative for chitinase production; however, chloroform and methanol extracts of the bacterial culture caused significant inhibition in the growth of the fungal isolates on semisolid media.

Dense, whitish mycelium developed within 48 h and turned gray after 72 h. Conidia were ellipsoid, hyaline, nonseptate, and formed in botryose heads. Spores from 10-day-old colonies that were developed on PDA in test tubes were removed with 4 ml of sterile water per tube. Prior to inoculation, inflorescences were detached and placed in water-filled glass vases. To test pathogenicity, eight healthy inflorescences were sprayed with a 5-ml suspension (2 × 104 conidia per ml of sterile distilled water). Another eight healthy inflorescences were sprayed with sterile distilled water. The inflorescences were maintained at 21°C and covered with polyethylene bags that were removed after 3 days. Brown, circular-to-irregular spots appeared on petals 5 days after inoculation, became coalescent, and covered 50 to 60% of each inflorescence in 8 days. Gray mold consisting of black conidiophores and gray-in-mass conidia was observed 3 days after the development of the symptoms. Controls remained symptomless. The same pathogen was recovered from inoculated flowers and was identified as Botrytis cinerea Pers.:Fr. (1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of this fungus on Hydrangea macrophylla in Argentina. Reference: (1) M. V. Ellis and J. M. Waller.

16887,First Report of Aspergillus Vine Canker on Table Grapes Caused by Aspergillus niger in Europe.,"In March of 2003, vine cankers and lesions were first observed on vigorous 1-year-old cv. Black Rose vines (Vitis vinifera) in a vineyard in southeastern Sicily, Italy. Since then, the same symptoms have been observed every year up to 2007 throughout the most important table grape production areas of Italy on cvs. Black Rose, Redglobe, and Italia. The disease epidemic has increased during the last 2 years, with incidence of cankered vines as much as 12.5%, and with two to three canker lesions per infected vine. On affected vines, most cankers were found at branch points and on the stems of young shoots grafted in the field. The infections seem to start from growth cracks on rapidly growing 1-year-old shoots or through wounds caused by the removal of lateral shoots. First symptoms usually appeared in late July or August as reddish pinhead-size drops of sap exuded from the infection site on the surface. By October to November, trunks of affected vines were girdled by the canker and prematurely displayed bright fall colors. The trunk appeared slightly larger and spongy where the canker occurred. Internally, cankered tissues were discolored and dead, and black powdery spores were abundant and sometimes visible on the surface. Callous tissue was often associated with the canker. Canker length was variable (average of approximately 8 cm) and either affected a small portion of the shoot's cross section or girdled it completely. Cultures of the fungus isolated from canker lesions or from the black spores within the lesions consistently yielded colonies typical of Aspergillus niger van Tiegh (3) when cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with 100 μg/ml of chloramphenicol. Pathogenicity tests were carried out on potted plants of cvs. Black Rose, Redglobe, and Italia grown in a greenhouse by inoculating six vigorous, young grapevines of each cultivar. Inoculations were made by placing 8-mm-diameter mycelial plugs taken from actively growing cultures of A. niger on a cut made by removal of a lateral shoot with a sterile razor. Inoculated sites were sealed with Parafilm to prevent dehydration of the inoculum. For a control treatment, an equal number of grapevines was inoculated with only a PDA plug. Three months later, all inoculated grapevines exhibited symptoms similar to those observed in the commercial vineyards while control vines remained symptomless. A. niger was always reisolated on PDA media from all infected vines. A. niger is reported to cause bunch rot complex of grape (1,2) and was previously reported in California causing Aspergillus vine canker (4). Since disease incidence and severity can increase year after year on vines grafted in the field, it is recommended that all cankers be removed by cutting back the vines in the fall. In the following March to April, growers could revisit the affected vines, evaluate shoot growth, and vines with weak shoot growth should be cut back below the canker. Subsequently, the vine can be retrained using a shoot originating from below the canker. To our knowledge, this is the first record of Aspergillus vine canker caused by A. niger on table grapes in Europe. References: (1) W. B. Hewitt. Compendium of Grape Diseases. R. C. Pearson and A. C.

16842,Severe Outbreak of Crown Rot and Root Rot Caused by Cylindrocladium pauciramosum on Strawberry Tree in Italy.,"From 2006 to 2009, a new disease was noticed in several commercial nurseries in Sicily (Italy) on ~13,000 potted plants of strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.) ranging from 3 months to 4 years old. Symptomatic plants showed a crown and root rot and internal brown discoloration of the basal stem. No leaf spots were detected. The percentage of symptomatic plants was variable in the different stocks (1 to 28%). A Cylindrocladium sp. was isolated consistently from symptomatic tissues on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Although many crown rots are caused by Phytophthora or Rhizoctonia spp., plating small pieces of diseased tissue from rotten roots and crowns onto corn meal agar or PDA yielded these pathogens sporadically. Twenty Cylindrocladium isolates obtained from infected basal stems, crowns, and roots were selected and subsequently cultured on carnation leaf agar (CLA). Macroconidiophores consisted of a stipe, a penicillate arrangement of fertile branches, and stipe extension terminating in an obpyriform-to-ellipsoidal vesicle (6 to 10 μm in diameter). Conidia cylindrical, straight, and 1-septate ranged from 40 to 60 × 4 to 5 μm. All single-conidial isolates were mated with tester strains DISTEF-G87 (MAT1-1) and DISTEF-G128 (MAT1-2) of Cylindrocladium pauciramosum (3) on CLA and produced fertile perithecia after 2 months. Perithecia were solitary or in groups, orange to red-brown, subglobose to ovoid, and ranged from 260 to 400 × 180 to 290 μm in diameter. On the basis of the combination of morphological and perithecial characters and mating type the isolates were identified as C. pauciramosum C.L. Schoch & Crous, teleomorph Calonectria pauciramosa C.L. Schoch & Crous (1,4). One representative isolate was deposited at Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS; No. 123918) open fungi collection. Pathogenicity tests were performed by adding sterile water to CLA cultures of C. pauciramosum from a single-conidial isolate and incorporating the resulting spore suspension (105 conidia per ml) on the soil surface of 20 3-month-old strawberry tree potted plants. The same number of plants served as a control. After inoculation, plants were maintained in a growth chamber at 25 ± 1°C and 90 to 95% relative humidity. All inoculated plants developed crown and root rot identical to one observed in the nursery 2 months after inoculation. Control plants remained symptomless. C. pauciramosum was always reisolated from infected plants. This fungus represents a serious threat for ornamental nurseries in Europe. Diseases related to infection of C. pauciramosum are different in relationship to the host tissues and the affected species. On strawberry tree, C. pauciramosum was previously detected in Italy as causal agent of leaf spots (2). To our knowledge, this is the first record of crown and root rot of strawberry tree caused by C. pauciramosum. In contrast with leaf spots, this report could indicate an important limiting factor for cultivation of strawberry tree potted plants in nurseries. The knowledge of the susceptibility of this host to crown and root rot caused by C. pauciramosum can help growers apply specific control strategies in nurseries. References: (1) P. W. Crous.

16507,Rhizoctonia Species and Anastomosis Groups from Corn Kernels in Turkey.,"In 1996, 165 samples of corn (Zea mays L.) kernels to be tested for seed-borne fungi were obtained from five provinces throughout the major corn-producing areas in the eastern Black Sea Region of Turkey: Artvin (41 samples), Rize (28 samples), Trabzon (32 samples), Giresun (30 samples), and Ordu (34 samples). A subsample of kernels (≈100 g each) from each sample was surface-disinfected in 3.5% NaOCl for 1 min. Kernels were washed in three changes of sterile water, and 100 kernels per subsample were placed in petri plates (5 kernels per plate) containing potato dextrose agar. After 5 to 7 days of incubation at 25°C in the dark, cultures were examined at 40× magnification for mycelia of Rhizoctonia spp. From 16,500 kernels examined, 40 isolates of Rhizoctonia spp. were recovered and characterized according to colony morphology and hyphal anastomosis using known tester isolates of Rhizoctonia spp. (1). Of these isolates, 10 were identified as R. solani, 18 as R. zeae, and 12 as binucleate Rhizoctonia sp. R. solani isolates were assigned to three anastomosis groups (AG): AG-4 (two isolates), AG-5 (two isolates), and AG-10 (six isolates). Binucleate Rhizoctonia sp. isolates were all assigned to AG-Ba. R. solani AG-4 and -5 and binucleate Rhizoctonia AG-Ba isolates were obtained from Artvin; R. solani AG-10 isolates were obtained from Ordu; and R. zeae isolates were obtained from Trabzon and Giresun.

5664,AN ULTRASTRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF MYCORRHIZAS IN RHODODENDRON-PONTICUM,"The sequence of events involved in the initiation, establishment and degeneration of the ericoid mycorrhizas of R. ponticum was followed at the ultrastructural level. Seedlings were planted in inoculated sterile soil or natural soil and harvested sequentially over a period of weeks. Their roots were fixed and examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. Field-collected roots were also examined for comparative purposes. In inoculated soil, surface colonization of root epidermal cells occurs within 4 wk of inoculation and penetration follows immediately. The functional life of the infected epidermal cell is short, evidence of degeneration of host cytoplasm being visible within 7 wk. Host breakdown precedes fungal degeneration, which suggests that nutrient transfer between partners must occur in the short period when both have full strucutural integrity. Endophyte hyphae degenerate after collapse of host cytoplasm, first becoming vacuolate and then devoid of contents. The result of this pattern of infection is that most cells of the root epidermis are dead and devoid of contents. The pattern is the same in natural soil, though each stage is delayed by 2-3 wk. The possible relationship between the structural and functional characteristics of ericoid roots is discussed and comparisons are made with other types of endomycorrhizas.","DUDDRIDGE, J; READ, DJ",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE,1982,10.1139/b82-287,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993265815661802,TRUE,2,12,Low,sterile,sterile; microscopy; examined; electron microscopy; fixed; examined; collected,mycorrhizas of R. ponticum was followed at the ultrastructural level.

925,"Diversity, Phylogeny and Antagonistic Activity of Fungal Endophytes Associated with Endemic Species of Cycas (Cycadales) in China","The culture-based approach was used to characterize the fungal endophytes associated with the coralloid roots of the endemic Cycas debaoensis and Cycas fairylakea from various population sites in China. We aim to determine if the assemblages of fungal endophytes inside these endemic plant hosts are distinct and could be explored for bioprospecting. The isolation method yielded a total of 284 culturable fungal strains. Identification based on the analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA showed that they belonged to two phyla, five classes, eight orders and 22 families. At least 33 known genera and 62 different species were confirmed based on >97% ITS sequence similarity. The most frequent and observed core taxa in the two host species regardless of their population origin were Talaromyces, Penicillium, Fusarium, Pochonia and Gliocladiopsis. Seventy percent was a rare component of the fungal communities with only one or two recorded isolates. Contrary to common notions, diversity and fungal richness were significantly higher in C. debaoensis and C. fairylakea collected from a botanical garden, while the lowest was observed in C. debaoensis from a natural habitat; this provides evidence that garden management, and to a minor extent, ex-situ conservation practice, could influence fungal endophyte communities. We further selected nineteen fungal isolates and screened for their antagonistic activities via a co-cultivation approach against the phytopathogens, Diaporthe sp. and Colletotrichum sp. Among these, five isolates with high ITS similarity matches with Hypoxylon vinosupulvinatum (GD019, 99.61%), Penicillium sp. (BD022, 100%), Penicillifer diparietisporus (GD008, 99.46%), Clonostachys rogersoniana (BF024, 99.46%) and C. rosea (BF011, 99.1%), which showed exceptional antagonistic activities against the phytopathogenic fungi with a significant inhibition rate of 70-80%. Taken together, our data presented the first and most comprehensive molecular work on culturable fungal endophytes associated with the coralloid roots of cycads. Our study also demonstrated that about 5% of fungal endophytes were not detected by the high-throughput sequencing approach, implying the equal importance of a culture-dependent approach to study fungal communities of cycads. We further highlighted the potential role of endemic and rare plants to discover and isolate unique plant-associated fungal taxa with excellent biocontrol properties.","Pecundo, MH; dela Cruz, TEE; Chen, T; Notarte, KI; Ren, H; Li, N",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2021,10.3390/jof7070572,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990197069213956,TRUE,2,12,Low,not detected,isolation; culture; sequencing; ITS; observed; screened; collected,"coralloid roots of cycads.

7728,"Correlations Between the Metabolome and the Endophytic Fungal Metagenome Suggests Importance of Various Metabolite Classes in Community Assembly in Horseradish (Armoracia rusticana, Brassicaceae) Roots","The plant microbiome is an increasingly intensive research area, with significance in agriculture, general plant health, and production of bioactive natural products. Correlations between the fungal endophytic communities and plant chemistry can provide insight into these interactions, and suggest key contributors on both the chemical and fungal side. In this study, roots of various horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) accessions grown under the same conditions were sampled in two consecutive years and chemically characterized using a quality controlled, untargeted metabolomics approach by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Sinigrin, gluconasturtiin, glucoiberin, and glucobrassicin were also quantified. Thereafter, a subset of roots from eight accessions (n = 64) with considerable chemical variability was assessed for their endophytic fungal community, using an ITS2 amplicon-based metagenomic approach using a custom primer with high coverage on fungi, but no amplification of host internal transcribed spacer (ITS). A set of 335 chemical features, including putatively identified flavonoids, phospholipids, peptides, amino acid derivatives, indolic phytoalexins, a glucosinolate, and a glucosinolate downstream product was detected. Major taxa in horseradish roots belonged to Cantharellales, Glomerellales, Hypocreales, Pleosporales, Saccharomycetales, and Sordariales. Most abundant genera included typical endophytes such as Plectosphaerella, Thanatephorus, Podospora, Monosporascus, Exophiala, and Setophoma. A surprising dominance of single taxa was observed for many samples. In summary, 35.23% of reads of the plant endophytic fungal microbiome correlated with changes in the plant metabolome. While the concentration of flavonoid kaempferol glycosides positively correlated with the abundance of many fungal strains, many compounds showed negative correlations with fungi including indolic phytoalexins, a putative glucosinolate but not major glucosinolates and a glutathione isothiocyanate adduct. The latter is likely an in vivo glucosinolate decomposition product important in fungal arrest. Our results show the potency of the untargeted metabolomics approach in deciphering plant-microbe interactions and depicts a complex array of various metabolite classes in shaping the endophytic fungal community.","Plaszkó, T; Szucs, Z; Cziáky, Z; Acs-Szabó, L; Csoma, H; Géczi, L; Vasas, G; Gonda, S",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2022,10.3389/fpls.2022.921008,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.899034801696744,TRUE,2,12,Low,no amplification,metagenom*; amplicon; ITS; ITS2; observed; assessed; sampled,"an ITS2 amplicon-based metagenomic approach using a custom primer with high coverage on fungi, but no amplification of host internal transcribed spacer (ITS).

During 2000, 2001, and 2002, a basal stem rot of golden barrel cactus was observed in several plastichouses located in eastern Sicily with disease levels of nearly 100% on young plants (up to 15 cm in diameter). On the basal crown area, the plants showed pale brown or yellow-orange, sunken lesions bordered by a reddish orange strip up to 1 mm wide. A water-soaked rot or white mycelium at the soil line was also observed. Thirty pieces (0.5 to 1 cm) from the edge of symptomatic tissues were surface disinfected for 2 min in 0.8% (wt/vol) NaOCl, washed with sterile distilled water (SDW), and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA). In addition, 20 pieces of affected tissue were ground in 400 μl of SDW (1:3, wt/wt), and the resulting suspensions were streaked by loops on PDA supplemented with 1.1 μl/ml of lactic acid (pH 4.4). A Fusarium sp. was consistently isolated from affected tissue pieces and streaks. Koch's postulates were performed at 25°C by inoculating 24 golden barrel cactus plants in 12-cm-diameter pots (12 plants previously sterile needle wounded) with 10 ml per plant of three suspensions (106 CFU/ml) of three isolates sprayed onto the basal stem. One milliliter per ten g of soil of each suspension was also added in the crown portion of golden barrel cacti. Twelve control cacti (six wounded) were sprayed only with SDW. Further pathogenicity tests were carried out on Thanksgiving cactus (Schlumbergera truncata (Haw.) Moran), devil's tongue barrel cactus (Ferocactus latispinus (Haw.) Britton & Rose), peruvian old man cactus (Espostoa lanata (Kunth) Britton & Rose), and Parodia spp. by inoculating eight plants for each host (four wounded) by placing 9-day-old 6-mm mycelial plugs at the base of the healthy cacti. An equal number of plants (four wounded) was inoculated only with a PDA plug. All cacti were maintained in polyethylene bags (90 to 95% for 72 hr) at 25°C. After 12 to 15 days, all wounded inoculated golden barrel, devil's tongue barrel, and peruvian old man cacti exhibited similar symptoms observed in the plastichouses. Typical symptoms were visible also in nonwounded and inoculated cacti 15 days later. Yellow-orange, tan, sunken, and roughly circular lesions were observed on the wounded and inoculated Thanksgiving and Parodia sp. cacti. Control plants were symptomless. The causal fungus was always reisolated from infected cacti. On the basis of 3-septate macroconidia (27 to 35 μm long × 3 to 4 μm wide [average 31.45 × 3.18 μm]), microconidia aseptate, single or double chlamydospores, and monophialide conidiophores observed on carnation leaf agar, and considering the susceptibility of all other inoculated hosts, the fungus was identified as F. oxysporum Schlechtend. f. sp. opuntiarum (Speg.)

10157,Colonization of roots of cultivated Solanum lycopersicum by dark septate and other ascomycetous endophytes,"Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) roots from four different crop sites in Colombia were surface sterilized and 51 fungal isolates were obtained and conserved for further analysis. Based on microscopical observations and growth characteristics, 20 fungal isolates corresponded to genus Fusarium, six presented asexual conidia different from Fusarium, eight were sterile mycelia, seven of which had dark septate hyphae and 17 did not continue to grow on plates after being recovered from conservation. Growth on different media, detailed morphological characterization and ITS region sequencing of the six sporulating and eight sterile isolates revealed that they belonged to different orders of Ascomycota and that the sterile dark septate endophytes did not correspond to the well known Phialocephala group. Interactions of nine isolates with tomato plantlets were assessed in vitro. No effect on shoot development was revealed, but three isolates caused brown spots in roots. Colonization patterns as analyzed by confocal microscopy differed among the isolates and ranged from epidermal to cortical penetration.

14336,"Biosynthesis, characterization and antibacterial efficacy of silver nanoparticles derived from endophytic fungi against P. gingivalis","Introduction: Microbial resistance to existing antimicrobial agents in periodontal therapy is a growing problem. Therefore, there is a need for development of new antimicrobial agents. Aim: To biosynthesize and characterize Silver Nanoparticles (AgNPs) using endophytic fungi and to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy against P. gingivalis. Materials and Methods: Cut leaf segments of Withania Somnifera (Ashwagandha) were used to isolate the fungi. Fresh cultures of fungi were inoculated in Erlenmeyer flask of 100 ml Malt Glucose Yeast Peptone (MGYP) broth and incubated at 29ºC for 72 hours for the biomass to grow. Biomass was filtered and cell free fungal filtrate was used further. Biosynthesized AgNPs were characterized by visual observation, Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Selected Area Electron Diffraction Analysis (SAED) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Antibacterial efficacy was evaluated by agar diffusion method measuring the zone of inhibition. The study groups included different concentrations of AgNPs: A (20 μl), B (40 μl), C (60 μl), D (80 μl) and E (100 μl) of AgNPs, F (0.2% CHX), G (2% CHX), H (Ampicillin) and I (sterile distilled water). The data collected for inhibition zones were statistically analysed using One-way Anova followed by Tukey post-hoc multiple comparison tests. Results: The fungi were identified as Fusarium semitectum. Characterization studies showed the colour change from colourless to reddish brown; U-V spectrum showed peak 420 nm, TEM revealed the particles spherical in shape and 10-20 nm in size. FTIR analysis revealed the presence of functional groups. AgNPs 80 µl and 100 µl showed mean zone of inhibition 17.33 and 18 mm against P. gingivalis.

12694,Seasonal diversity and spaciotemporal distribution of fungal endophytes associated with the medicinal plant Coleus forskohlii Briq.,"Fungi that colonize the healthy tissues of the plants without showing any disease symptoms in the host plants are termed as fungal endophytes. The presence of fungal endophytes provides a positive effect on the host's growth and development and also triggers the production of some essential bioactive compounds in the host. This study was undertaken to isolate, identify and understand the spaciotemporal distribution and seasonal diversity of fungal endophytes associated with the leaf, stem and root of Coleus forskohlii, an important and endangered medicinal plant. Sampling was done for a period of 12 months between May 2020-April 2021. A total of 950 fungal endophytes were isolated from a total of 1680 tissues of the leaf, stem and root of C. forskohlii. The fungi were identified based on their morphological features and some of them were identified by molecular identification by 18S rRNA sequencing. The endophytic isolates belonged to 10 different orders belonging to 3 different classes-Sordariomycetes (Hypocreales, Xylariales, Microascales, Trichosphaeriales, Glomerellales and Sordariales), Dothiomycetes (Pleosporales, Capnodiales, Botryosphaeriales) and Eurotiomyctes (Eurotiales). About 81.26% of the isolates belonged to Ascomycota and 2.63% of the isolates belonged to Mucoromycota. Chaetomium globosum, Collariella bostrychodes, C. robusta, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Fusarium chlamydosporum, Sterile hyaline mycelia, Aspergillus niger, Xylaria curta, X. grammica, Mucor circinelloides and Trichoderma harizianum were the frequently isolated species of fungi. C. globosum, C. bostrychodes, C. gloeosporioides, sterile hyaline mycelia and X. curta were found distributed in all the tissues of the plant.

16902,Crown Rot of Strawberry Caused by Macrophomina phaseolina in California.,"In 2006 and 2007, severely diseased strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) plants were observed in five commercial fields in southern California (Orange County). Disease generally occurred in discrete patches. Within such patches, disease incidence ranged from 10 to 75%. Symptoms consisted of wilting of foliage, drying and death of older leaves, plant stunting, and eventual collapse and death of plants. When plant crowns were dissected, internal vascular and cortex tissues were dark brown to orange brown. Fruiting bodies or other fungal structures were not observed. A fungus was consistently isolated from symptomatic crown tissue that had been surface sterilized and placed on acidified corn meal agar (LA-CMA). All isolates produced numerous, dark, irregularly shaped sclerotia that were 67 to 170 μm long and 44 to 133 μm wide. When isolates were grown on 1.5% water agar with dried and sterilized wheat straw, dark, ostiolate pycnidia and hyaline, single-celled, cylindrical conidia were produced. On the basis of these characters, all isolates were identified as Macrophomina phaseolina (1). The symptomatic plants tested negative for Colletotrichum spp., Phytophthora spp., Verticillium dahliae, and other pathogens. Inoculum for pathogenicity tests was produced by growing six isolates on CMA on which sterilized wood toothpicks were placed on the agar surface. After 1 week, toothpicks were removed and inserted 4 to 5 mm deep into the basal crown tissue of potted strawberry plants (cv. Camarosa) grown in soilless, peatmoss-based rooting medium. Ten plants were inoculated per isolate and one toothpick was inserted per plant. Ten control strawberry plants were treated by inserting one sterile toothpick into each crown. All plants were then grown in a shadehouse. After 2 weeks, all inoculated plants began to show wilting and decline of foliage. By 4 weeks, all inoculated plants had collapsed. Internal crown tissue was discolored and similar in appearance to the original field plants. M. phaseolina was isolated from all inoculated plants. Control plants did not exhibit any disease symptoms, and crown tissue was symptomless. The test was repeated and the results were similar. While M. phaseolina has been periodically associated with strawberry in California (3), to my knowledge, this is the first report of charcoal rot disease on commercial strawberry in California. Charcoal rot of strawberry has been reported in Egypt, France, India, Israel, and the United States (Florida and Illinois) (2,4). Similar to previous reports (2,4), many of the affected California fields were not preplant fumigated with methyl bromide + chloropicrin fumigants, and it is possible that under these changing production practices this pathogen may increase in importance in California.

20163,"Neotyphodium/Epichloe ENDOPHYTES OF PERENNIAL RYEGRASS, MEADOW FESCUE AND RED FESCUE CULTIVARS CULTIVATED IN POLAND","Grasses are very often infected by endophytic fungi of the Neotyphodium and Epichloe genera. They can produce metabolites toxic to livestock as well as beneficially affect grasses. Thus, endophytes can be used for plants improvement. These facts stimulated a more detailed investigation aimed at providing more insight into the problem of these endophytes in Poland. The aims of the research were as follows: (i) to determine the levels of colonization of Polish-grown cultivars of perennial ryegrass, meadow fescue, and red fescue with endophytic fungi of the genera Neotyphodium and Epichloe; (ii) to determine the potential hazards associated with the toxins produced by the active associations; (iii) to isolate viable endophytes of the genera Neotyphodium and Epichloe from active associations; and (iv) to determine the levels of antagonistic activity of the obtained endophyte isolates against selected microorganisms, in particular serious grass pathogens, in vitro. The staining method was used for endophytes detection in grass seed collection. Endophytes were isolated on PDA medium and characterized. Antagonistic activity of N/E isolates and seed extracts were determined in dual culture assays and on microscope slides respectively. Ergovaline and lolitrem B content were assayed. There were 242 samples of seeds of 50 cultivars of grasses collected in Poland, including 124 samples of 20 cultivars of perennial ryegrass, 61 samples of 10 cultivars of meadow fescue, and 57 samples of 20 cultivars of red fescue.

They can produce metabolites toxic to livestock as well as beneficially affect grasses. Thus, endophytes can be used for plants improvement. These facts stimulated a more detailed investigation aimed at providing more insight into the problem of these endophytes in Poland. The aims of the research were as follows: (i) to determine the levels of colonization of Polish-grown cultivars of perennial ryegrass, meadow fescue, and red fescue with endophytic fungi of the genera Neotyphodium and Epichloë; (ii) to determine the potential hazards associated with the toxins produced by the active associations; (iii) to isolate viable endophytes of the genera Neotyphodium and Epichloë from active associations; and (iv) to determine the levels of antagonistic activity of the obtained endophyte isolates against selected microorganisms, in particular serious grass pathogens, in vitro. The staining method was used for endophytes detection in grass seed collection. Endophytes were isolated on PDA medium and characterized.

16944,"First Report of Blueberry Botrytis Blight in Buenos Aires, Entre Ríos, and Córdoba, Argentina.","Since 2003, a new field disease has been observed on several cultivars of highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) in Buenos Aires (Baradero, Colonia Urquiza, Lima, Mercedes, and San Pedro), Entre Ríos (Concordia, Gualeguaychú, and Larroque), and Córdoba (Capilla del Monte and La Cumbre). Infected flowers turned brown to tan with a water-soaked appearance and shriveled up. Blighted flowers typically did not produce fruits; even an entire cluster of berries could be aborted. A chlorotic area, that later became necrotic and turned light brown, developed when leaves were in contact with blighted flowers. A watery rot developed on fruit occasionally before harvest but more generally after harvest. Infected tender green twigs also became blighted, with leaf tissue becoming brown to black. Older twigs and stems were also blighted. Abundant, gray mycelium with conidial masses developed on all affected tissues under moist conditions. Sections of infected leaves, twigs, stems, flowers, and fruits were surfaced sterilized with 0.2% NaOCl, plated on 2% potato dextrose agar (pH 7), and incubated at 22°C. Pure cultures formed a whitish dense mycelial mat and turned gray after 72 h. Conidia were ellipsoid, hyaline, nonseptate, and formed on botryose heads. They ranged from 5.8 to 9 × 8.1 to 13.7 μm (average 8.6 × 10.2 μm). Black, round, and irregular microsclerotia developed on 7-day-old cultures with an average size of 1.1 × 1.7 mm. Morphological characteristics agree with those described for Botrytis cinerea Pers.:Fr (1). Pathogenicity was tested on 10 12-month-old potted blueberry plants cv. O'Neal by spraying a suspension of 1 × 106 conidia per ml of sterile distilled water. Ten plants used as controls were sprayed with sterile distilled water. Each plant was covered with a transparent polyethylene bag for 48 h and incubated at 20 ± 2°C in humid chambers for 15 days. Lesions similar to those observed in the fields developed after 4 days and asexual fructifications developed after 5 days. The same pathogen was reisolated from the lesions, thus completing Koch's postulates. Water-treated plants remained symptomless. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a disease caused by B. cinerea on blueberry in Buenos Aires, Córdoba, and Entre Ríos provinces of Argentina. References: (1) M. V. Ellis and J. M.

16262,Effects of seed soaking of Avena sativa in fungal fermentation broth on rhizosphere fungal community structure and drought resistance of oats; [真 菌 发 酵 液 浸 种 燕 麦 对 其 抗 旱 性及 根 际 真 菌 群 落 结 构 的 影 响],In this study，seeds of oat（Avena sativa）were soaked in a broth without fungi（CK）or in the borth of a culture of one of four plant endophytic fungi（three Penicillium and one Trichoderma species）isolated from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Then，the growth，physiology，and root endophytic fungal community structure of the oat under osmotic stress were evaluated. After seed-soaking treatments，seeds were germinated in Petri dishes，grown in pots under normal conditions for 30 days，and then grown under different osmotic stress treatments for a further 10 days. The plants were subjected to osmotic stress treatments，which were established by adding 50 mL of a solution containing polyethylene glycol at concentrations（V/V）of 5%，10% and 15%（mild stress）；20% and 25%（moderate stress）；30% and 35%（severe stress）. Sterile water was added to the unstressed control（0% polyethylene glycol）. The plant height，fresh weight，dry weight and chlorophyll contents of the oat seedlings generally decreased with increasing severity of drought stress， and peroxidase activity and the contents of malondialdehyde and proline varied widely depending on which endophytic fungus had been used for seed soaking. Illumina Miseq data were obtained from the 40-day-old plants grown from fungal broth-soaked seeds. In total，192944 valid sequences obtained，corresponding to 1140 operational taxonomic units belonging to 9 phyla，15 classes，34 orders，56 families，and 148 genera. Compared with the CK group，seed-soaking changed the community structure of endophytic fungi in the oat roots. Soaking seeds in fungal broth increased the relative abundance of Russulaceae（Basidiomycota）. The dominant genus was Lactarius，whereas the dominant genus in the CK was Alternaria. Principal component analysis divided Penicillium and Trichoderma strains used for seed-soaking into three categories： growth-promoting strains， stress-enhancing strains， and strains that increase microbial diversity. Trichoderma alni increased the diversity of endophytic fungi in roots，whereas Penicillium spp. and Penicillium goetzii significantly promoted oat growth and stress resistance. These results show that soaking seed in the culture broth of endophytic fungi from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau can enhanced the response of oat plant to drought stress by promoting growth，reducing drought-induced oxidative damage，and changing the community structure of endophytic fungi in the roots. © 2024 Editorial Office of Acta Prataculturae Sinica.

11442,Chromolaena laevigata (Asteraceae) as a source of endophytic non-aflatoxigenic Aspergillus flavus: chemical profile in different culture conditions and biological applications,"Endophytes are microorganisms that form symbiotic relationships with their host. These microorganisms can produce a variety of secondary metabolites, some of which have inhibitory effects on pests and pathogens or even act to promote plant growth. Due to these characteristics, these microorganisms are used as sources of biologically active substances for a wide range of biotechnological applications. Based on that, the aim of this study was to evaluate the production of metabolites of the endophytic Aspergillus flavus CL7 isolated from Chromolaena laevigata, in four different cultivation conditions, and to determine the antimicrobial, cytotoxic, antiviral, and antioxidant potential of these extracts. The multiphasic approach used to identify this strain was based on morphology and ITS gene sequence analysis. The chemical investigation of A. flavus using potato dextrose and minimal medium, using both stationary and agitated methods, resulted in the isolation of kojic acid, alpha-cyclopiazonic acid, and 20,25-dihydroxyaflavinine. Another 18 compounds in these extracts were identified by UHPLC-HRMS/MS, of which dideacetyl parasiticolide A has been described for the first time from A. flavus.

15982,Effect of trichoderma species on growth of pathogenic fungus hymenoscyphus fraxineus in dual cultures; [Utjecaj gljiva roda trichoderma na rast patogene gljive hymenoscyphus fraxineus u dvojnim kulturama],"Narrow-leaved ash, an important pioneer tree species in Croatian floodplain forests, is suffering severe dieback in the last years, mostly due to the pathogenic fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus. Multiple studies have shown that there is a possibility to control the pathogen with the use of endophytes, fungi that naturally occur in healthy plant tissue without causing any visible disease symptoms. As species of genus Trichoderma were found to be the most common endophytes of narrow-leaved ash root and stem in Croatia, in this research we tested the antagonistic activity of Trichoderma capillare, T. harzianum and T. tomentosum (each represented with one isolate) against H. fraxineus (represented with isolates HF16 and HF 120) in dual cultures. Control cultures with sterile agar plugs and self-inhibition cultures with two plugs of H. fraxineus mycelium were also established. All cultures were prepared in five repetitions, resulting in a total of 50 com-binations. Total growth, i.e. the colony radius of H. fraxineus was measured in three directions at four time points, first after 10 days of its independent growth, and then weekly after placing the challenge isolates in cultures. Both H. fraxineus isolates stopped growing in dual cultures with all three Trichoderma species in the period between the second and third measurement, i.e. 7-14 days after confrontation, while the ones in control and self-inhibition cultures continued growing. Fisher LSD test revealed that there was a significant impact of T. harzianum and T. tomentosum on growth reduction of both H. fraxineus isolates compared to pathogen’s growth in control cultures, while T. capillare significantly inhibited the growth of one isolate only (HF16). The same test showed that there was no significant difference in inhibition among used Trichoderma species, however, T. harzianum and T. tomentosum overgrew H. fraxineus completely (complete replace-ment) in the first 7 days of confrontation in all dual cultures, while T. capillare accomplished only partial replacement of the pathogen in 14 or 21 days of confrontation, depending on the culture. Also, the latter was the only species in this research inhibited reciprocally by the pathogen, i.e. there was a formation of the sterile zone without Trichoderma capillare growth (initial deadlock) visible in all dual cultures. Although our results support the possibility of using Trichoderma species in biological suppression of H. fraxineus, further extensive research is needed, with more frequent measurements encompassing more isolates of both the pathogen and these endophytes, and focusing on investigating exact mechanisms of inhibition and testing the efficiency in planta. © 2020, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Political Sciences.

20715,"Endophytic fungal diversity of five dominant plant species in the dry-hot valley of Yuanjiang, Yunnan Province, China","Fungi causing asymptomatic infections in living plant tissues have been called endophytic fungal. They comprise a diverse group of fungi and may protect their host plants against the insect pests and phytopathogens, increase hosts fitness in extreme environments. In order to document the ecological relationship between endophytic fungal and their host plants which grown in hot and dry stressed environments, the endophytic fungal diversity, the dominant fungi and their host specificity of 5 dominant plant species (Atylosia scarabaeoides, Azadirachta indica, Phyllanthus emblica, Broussonetia papyrifera and Sida acuta) which grown in the dry-hot valley of Yuanjiang Yunnan Province, southwest China were studied in present research works. A total of 371 endophytic fungal were isolated from 525 tissue segments of the 5 plant species. The isolation rate was 0.71. The highest isolation rate appeared in S. acuta, it was 0.92, while the lowest isolation rate appeared in A. indica, it was only 0. 61. It was found that the isolation rate of leaves endophytic fungal was significantly higher than that of stems (P <0. 05) in the 5 plant species. Based on their morphology and the mechanism of spore production, the sporulating isolates were identified to genus level. Non-sporulating isolates were identified as mycelia sterile and sorted into different groups based on the colony surface texture, hyphal pigmentation and growth rates after two months sporulation. The isolated fungi were finally identified to 32 taxa including Phomopsis, Colletotrichum and Alternaria etc. The endophytic fungal richness of the 5 plant species was different. The highest endophytic fungal richness appeared in A. scarabaeoides, from which 20 endophytic fungal taxa were obtained, whereas the fungi from A. indica were just 11 taxa and showed the lowest richness. Each plant species harboured 1 to 2 dominant fungi. The dominant fungi of A. scarabaeoides were Bipolaris sp. and Phomopsis sp., the relative frequency was 38. 81% and 14. 93% respectively. Phomopsis sp. and an ascomycete species were the dominant fungi of A. indica and P. emblica, the relative frequency of Phomopsis sp. was 12. 90% and 40. 24%, the relative frequency of the ascomycete was 33. 87% and 17. 07% respectively. The dominant fungi of B. papyrifera and S. acuta was Phomopsis sp., the relative frequency was 49. 25% and 50. 54% respectively.

7053,Antifungal activity of volatile and non-volatile metabolites of endophytes of Chloranthus elatior Sw.,"Agriculture crops that have fungal infections suffer significant economic losses and reduced crop output. Chemical fungicides are used to tackle the problem, although this has additional detrimental side effects. There is an urgent need for safe and novel antifungals. Volatiles from plant-beneficial endophytic fungi are considered promising alternatives for the biological control of fungal pathogens as a sustainable approach in an agroecosystem. In the present investigation, a volatile-emitting sterile endophytic fungus, Diaporthe sp. CEL3 with bio-fumigation activity, was isolated from leaves of the ethnomedicinal plant Chloranthus elatior Sw., collected from the Passighat forest of North-East India. The camphor odor volatiles of CEL3 showed an inhibitory effect against eight fungal pathogens in vitro and minimized the infections of Monilinia fructicola, a causal agent of cherry fruit rot, in VOC-exposed cherry fruits. Rhizoctonia solani, Botrytis cinerea, Pythium ultimum, and M. fructicola were maximally inhibited up to 51.5%, 55.8%, 61.9%, and 78.5%, respectively, in comparison to control by the volatiles. Another isolate, CEL7, identified as Curvularia sp., synthesized non-volatile, soluble antifungal metabolites in its cell-free extracts and exhibited antifungal action. Bioassay-guided fractionation revealed the presence of imidazole compounds- (2-aminoethyl)-1H-imidazole-2-carbaldehyde, Pyrazole 4, 5 imidazole, 1-formyl 3-ethyl, phenol compounds-Phenol, 4-[2-(methylamino) ethyl]-, 6-Nitro-3-chlorophenol, Phenol, 2,4,6-tri-tert-butyl-, etc., in the cell-free extracts, with a MIC value of 250-2,000 mu g ml(-1). Optimum VOC emission was achieved in a modified PDA medium with instantly smashed potato (150 g L-1), dextrose (20 g L-1), wheat husk (20 g L-1), and yeast extract (20 g L-1), with additional salts. Interestingly, endophytic CEL3 emitted different types of volatiles, and trans-verbenol (32.25%), geraniol (30.32%), trans-ocimenol (12.90%), and mentha-4,8-diene (5.16%) were the prime ones. These VOCs cause lethal leakage of protein and necessary intracellular molecules from the fungal pathogens. Thus, CEL3 could potentially be used as a bio-fumigating agent to control post-harvest infections caused by fungal pathogens. This study opens a new approach to the use of endophytic fungi in biocontrol.","Santra, HK; Banerjee, D",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2023,10.3389/fpls.2023.1156323,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98976349026174,TRUE,2,11,Low,sterile,isolated; medium; sterile; PDA; ITS; collected,"fungal pathogens as a sustainable approach in an agroecosystem.

9450,"Potential ecological effects of Piriformospora indica, a possible biocontrol agent, in UK agricultural systems","Piriformospora indica (syn. Serendipita indica), a root endophytic fungus, was originally isolated from an arid sub-tropical soil. P. indica forms mutualistic symbioses with a broad range of host plants, increases biomass production, resistance and tolerance to fungal pathogens and abiotic stresses. These characteristics make it a very attractive component of more sustainable agriculture. So, it is desirable to understand its wider ecosystem effects. We determined how long P. indica could survive in the soil and how it interacts with other soil microorganisms and some important arable weeds. Survival of P. indica in the soil, under winter and summer conditions in the UK was tested by isolating DNA and RNA of P. indica from pots of soil which had been left open to winter-summer weather conditions without host plants, followed by PCR and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) with P. indica-specific primers. P. indica effects on other soil and root microorganisms were tested by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of DNA extracted from soil and roots from pots in which P. indica-infected wheat had been grown. The effect of P. indica on growth of black-grass (Alopecurus myosuroides), wild-oat (Avena fatua) and cleavers (Galium aparine) was tested alone and in competition with wheat. In soil P. indica-mRNA and DNA could still be detected after eight months, but not after 15 months. Soils from P. indica-inoculated pots had distinct fungal and bacterial species communities which were more diverse than non-inoculated controls. P. indica infected A. myosuroides and A. fatua but was not detected in G. aparine. The average above-ground competitiveness of the weeds with wheat was decreased. If applied to field crops in the UK, P. indica would be persistent for up to 15 months and likely to alter competitive relations within vegetation.

4577,Elucidating the influence of resident seed and soil microbiota on the developing creeping bentgrass microbiome,"Characterization of the plant microbiome may allow for the development of diagnostic tools or improvements in plant health. To that end, this project sought to determine the influence that resident seed and soil microbiota exert on the developing creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L. cv. 007) microbiome. A sterile growth environment was created in a laminar flow hood. Sterile 50 ml conical tubes were filled with autoclaved or non-autoclaved soil (85% sand and 15% peat) and seeded with 007 creeping bentgrass. Foliage and rhizosphere samples were taken at emergence, 2, 4, and 6 wk post-emergence, and soil samples were taken at the conclusion of the experiment. Amplicon sequencing libraries were generated from extracted environmental DNA, sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq, and analyzed in R. After quality control 3.32 x 10(7) sequences were grouped into 2,273 bacterial and 303 fungal amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). Bacterial and fungal ASVs were predominantly members of the Proteobacteria and Eurotiomycetes, respectively. Over the 6-wk sampling period the microbial communities were stable, with taxonomic shifts occurring mainly in low relative abundant taxa. Ordination of Bray-Curtis distance matrices revealed significant differences in community centroids between grass planted in autoclaved and non-autoclaved soil. However, taxonomic profiling showed these differences were due to shifts in taxa present at low relative abundances <.5%).

Nevertheless, the endophytic role of FO12 in herbaceous hosts is still uncertain. Thus, the aim of this study was to demonstrate the nonpathogenic character of FO12 in eight V. dahliae-susceptible herbaceous hosts and to evaluate its ability to promote plant growth. To this end, plants of each host were grown in pots filled with sterile peat moss and inoculated by irrigation with a conidial suspension of FO12 (106 conidia ml- 1) two times-at sowing and at the emergence of the first true leaves. Many plants irrigated with sterile distilled water were included as controls. Sampling was conducted at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after the second inoculation. The fresh weight and length of the aerial parts, roots, and whole plants were determined at each sampling time. Fungal colonization was assessed via quantitative and qualitative methods, including microbiological isolation from roots and stems and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) imaging at each sampling time. FO12 exhibited the ability to endophytically colonize the roots and stems of the inoculated plants. However, the effect on growth and the degree of colonization varied depending on the host. FO12 did not exert any evident pathogenic effects or negative effects on plant growth or development. The growth of the eggplant, lettuce, and tomato plants in the FO12 treatment group was similar to that in the control group, whereas the relative area under the growth progress curve was significantly greater than that in the control group for plant length in cotton and cucumber; for root fresh weight in pepper, sunflower, and wheat; and for plant fresh weight in sunflower and wheat.

15854,Interactions between putatively endophytic bacteria and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea): plant growth promotion and colonization in host and non-host cultivars,"Aims: Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) is a forage grass highly used in prairies. Cultivar SFRO Don Tomás has excellent drought and cold resistance, characteristics which are influenced by the native endophytic bacterial community. The aims of this work were to deepen the characterization of a selected group of putatively endophytic strains with different plant growth promoting (PGP) traits and to analyze the relationship between colonization and PGP abilities. Methods: PGP with single inoculations in pots containing a mixture of sterile sand and field soil and with paired inoculations in field soil cores were carried out. Colonization of plants inoculated singly or co-inoculated under gnotobiotic conditions was quantified. Confocal laser microscopy was used to visualize the colonization and infection processes of strain Streptomyces sp. UYFA156 in cultivars SFRO Don Tomás and Tacuabé. Results: Tall fescue cultivars displayed different responses to single bacterial inoculation. Inoculation with two strain pairs which included UYFA156 were successful in promoting growth in soil cores. Higher bacterial densities did not correspond to higher PGP. Strain UYFA156 was observed colonizing both fescue cultivars. Conclusions: UYFA156 is a true endophyte of tall fescue.

17791,Novel cultivated endophytic Verrucomicrobia reveal deep-rooting traits of bacteria to associate with plants.,"Despite the relevance of complex root microbial communities for plant health, growth and productivity, the molecular basis of these plant-microbe interactions is not well understood. Verrucomicrobia are cosmopolitans in the rhizosphere, nevertheless their adaptations and functions are enigmatic since the proportion of cultured members is low. Here we report four cultivated Verrucomicrobia isolated from rice, putatively representing four novel species, and a novel subdivision.

2985,Patterns of interaction between Populus Esch5 and Piriformospora indica:: A transition from mutualism to antagonism,"Piriformospora indica (Sebacinaceae, Basidiomycota) is an axenically cultivable, plant growth promoting root endophyte with a wide host range, including Populus. Rooting of Populus Esch5 explants started within 6 days after transfer to WPM medium. If such plantlets with roots were inoculated with P. indica, there was an increase in root biomass, and the number of 2nd order roots was increased significantly. A totally different observation was recorded when the explants were placed into WPM with pre-grown P. indica. The interaction led to complete blocking of root production and severely inhibited plant growth. Additionally, branched aerial roots appeared which did not penetrate the medium. On contact with the fungal colony or the medium, the ends of the aerial roots became inflated. Prolonged incubation stimulated the fungus to colonize aerial parts of the plant (stem and leaves). Mycelium not only spread on the surface of the aerial parts, but also invaded the cortical tissues inter- and intracellularly. Detached Populus leaves remained vital for 4-5 weeks on sterile agar media or on AspMI medium with pre-grown P. indica. When the fungus was pre-grown on culture media such as WPM, containing ammonium as the main source of nitrogen, leaves in contact with the cultures turned brownish within 4-12 h. Thereafter, the leaves bleached, and about one day later had become whitish. Thus, cultural conditions could alter the behaviour of the fungus drastically: the outcome of the interaction between plant and fungus can be directed from mutualistic to antagonistic, characterized by fungal toxin formation and extension of the colonization to Populus shoots.","Kaldorf, M; Koch, B; Rexer, KH; Kost, G; Varma, A",PLANT BIOLOGY,2005,10.1055/s-2005-837470,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.994071618430379,TRUE,2,10,Low,sterile,culture; medium; agar; colony; sterile,the cortical tissues inter- and intracellularly.

7646,Endophytic fungi associated with palms,"Endophytic fungi were isolated from three unidentified Licuala sp. palms in Brunei Darussalam and from three L. ramsayi palms in Australia. Endophytes were very common in both species, with overall colonisation rates of 81-89%. Taking into account a lower sampling frequency in Australia, endophyte diversity was similar in the two Licuala species. The endophyte assemblages examined were very diverse, consisting of 75 fertile species and 60 sterile morphospecies. The endophyte communities of both palms were composed of a single, dominant xylariaceous species, approximately ten less common but equally ubiquitous species and a large number of species occurring at very low frequencies. Differences were observed between the endophytic mycotas of different palm tissues and of tissues of different ages. The results presented suggest that most of the endophytes entered the petiole via the leaf and that transmission of palm endophytes is likely to be horizontal (via airborne propagules) rather than vertical (via seed). Seasonal differences were not observed in Brunei. Increased sampling effort could be expected to yield more endophyte taxa in both species investigated.","Fröhlich, J; Hyde, KD; Petrini, O",MYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH,2000,10.1017/S095375620000263X,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.986360119402454,TRUE,2,10,Low,sterile,isolated; sterile; examined; observed; investigated; examined,"species.

Periconia macrospinosa and Microdochium sp. formed typical DSE structures in the roots; Periconia produced melanized intracellular microsclerotia in host root cortex, whereas Microdachium produced abundant melanized inter- and intracellular chlamydospores. To further validate the results of the leek resynthesis growth responses of leek and a dominant prairie grass, Andropogon gerardii, were assessed in a laboratory resynthesis system. Leek growth mainly was unresponsive to the inoculation with Periconia or Microdochium, whereas Andropogon tended to respond positively.

Studies on this emerging field is very less among the research communities. The present study focused on the molecular phylogenetics of the endophytic fungus that associated with the leaf of Kayea assamica, an endemic plant species of Northeast India and identification of its secondary metabolites (natural product) that produced under in vitro condition. The endogenous fungus was isolated from the sterile disease-free leaf segment (similar to 1 cm), followed by PCR amplification of ITS region using the extracted genomic DNA as a template. Further, the crude methanol extract of the fungal culture was subjected to Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The molecular phylogenetic analysis confirmed the fungal isolate as Beltraniella species (endophyte). The ITS sequence was submitted to GenBank database (Id MH295767.1). The GC-MS analysis revealed eleven different secondary metabolites at different retention times. Many of these compounds have been reported to be plant & endophytic metabolite, essential oil component, recognized fragrant molecule, antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer activities etc. The findings projected that the endophyte may have a significant role in the host-defense mechanism. Tetrapentacontane is a part of fragrant molecules found in juvenile agarwood shown highest abundance (54.63%) at 21.477 RT followed by the others.

16643,First Report of a Leaf Spot and Stem Canker Caused by Myrothecium roridum on Watermelon in the United States.,"Myrothecium roridum Tode:Fr, pathogenic to a number of cucurbit species, causes fruit rots, cankers on crowns and stems, and leaf spots. Hosts include cantaloupe and honeydew (Cucurbita melo) and cucumber (Cucumis sativus) (1,3). In June 2004, following a period of heavy rainfall, numerous round-to-oblong, brown lesions with concentric rings were observed on leaves of watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) cv. Desert King at the Blackshank Farm in Tifton, GA. Disease was localized in the field and severity was low (<5% of leaf area affected). No symptoms were observed on fruit. Sections of tissue were removed from the margin between healthy and diseased tissue and plated on acidified, 25% potato dextrose agar (aPDA). A small plug of agar and mycelium were removed from colonies that emerged from lesions and were transferred to aPDA. Isolated colonies were characterized by a white, floccose mycelium with concentric, dark green-to-black rings of sporodochia bearing viscid masses of conidia. Conidia were cylindrical with rounded ends and measured 6 to 8 × 1.5 to 2.5 μm. The features of the fungus were consistent with the description of Myrothecium roridum (1,2). Pathogenicity tests were conducted in a temperature-controlled greenhouse. Twenty-five watermelon plants (cv. Desert King) were inoculated with a conidial suspension of M. roridum (5 × 105 conidia per ml) plus 0.1% vol/vol Tween 20. Inoculum was applied on leaves and stems until runoff with a hand-held mister, and plants were placed in a dew chamber for 72 h. Ten plants were sprayed with sterile, distilled water to serve as controls. Inoculated and noninoculated control plants were removed from the dew chamber and maintained at 25 to 28°C. Symptoms appeared 8 days after inoculation and were characterized by round, dark lesions with concentric rings; noninoculated plants were symptomless. Sections of symptomatic tissue were plated, and M. roridum was reisolated. Although M. roridum is a common pathogen of melons and cucumber, to our knowledge, this is the first field report of a leaf spot caused by M. roridum on watermelon in the United States. No further occurrences of the disease on watermelon have been observed in Georgia since the initial discovery of M. roridum in 2004; however, losses could be potentially severe if widespread infection of fruit were to occur.

12203,Genetic variability among strains of Phialocephala fortinii and phylogenetic analysis of the genus Phialocephala based on rDNA ITS sequence comparisons,"Two methods to determine variability among strains of Phialocephala fortinii and sterile DSE (dark septate endophyte) Type 1 were compared: inter-simple sequence repeat polymerase chain reaction analysis (ISSR-PCR) and sequence analysis of the two internal transcribed spacers and the 5.8S ribosomal DNA (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2). Both methods showed similar results for some strains, but different results for others. Phylogenetic analysis of various strains of P. fortinii and Type 1 based on ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequence information showed that Type 1 strains, with the exception of one Type 1 strain and a strain with a Type-1-like culture morphology, form a well-supported clade, whereas P. fortinii strains are much more variable and the relative position of many strains on the tree are unresolved. Two sterile DSE strains with Type 1 culture morphology form a well-supported clade, separate from the P. fortinii - Type 1 clade. Phylogenetic analysis of some species of the Leotiales and of Phialocephala and related species based on ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequences indicate that the genera Phialocephala and Sporendocladia are polyphyletic. One major clade, supported by a high bootstrap value, is positioned as a well-separated lineage among members of the Leotiales. Phialocephala fortinii, Phialocephala dimorphospora, Phialocephala compacta, Phialocephala scopiformis, and Type 1, all known as endophytes of woody plant species, are positioned in this clade. A second well-supported clade including Phialocephala humicola, Phialocephala xalapensis, and Phialocephala fusca was positioned outside the Leotiales. Phialocephala xalapensis and P. humicola had identical sequences and were not separable based on morphology. The two taxa were, therefore, considered to represent the same species. Phialocephala virens, Phialophora finlandia, Sporendocladia foliicola, and Leptodontidium orchidicola were not included in either of the two Phialocephala clades.","Grünig, CR; Sieber, TN; Rogers, SO; Holdenrieder, O",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE,2002,10.1139/B02-115,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.988946473714703,TRUE,2,10,Low,sterile,culture; sterile; pcr; ITS1; ITS2,Two methods to determine variability among strains of Phialocephala fortinii and sterile DSE (dark septate endophyte) Type 1 were compared: inter-simple sequence repeat polymerase chain reaction analysis,"strains, with the exception of one Type 1 strain and a strain with a Type-1-like culture morphology, form a well-supported clade, whereas P. fortinii strains are much more variable and the | Two methods to determine variability among strains of Phialocephala fortinii and sterile DSE (dark septate endophyte) Type 1 were compared: inter-simple sequence repeat polymerase chain reaction analysis",culture_absence,culture_methods; molecular_methods

Infected buds shrink, but do not rot or disintegrate, and remain on the bush. Coremia (2.0 mm high and 0.5 mm wide), which appeared as black specks on outer bud scales, produced large numbers of spherical spores apically that measured 3.6 to 5.5 μm in diameter. The fungus Pycnostysanus azaleae (1) was consistently isolated after disinfested infected buds (1 min in 5.15% commercial NaOCl solution) were cultured on potato dextrose agar amended with streptomycin sulfate at 100 mg/liter. Pathogenicity of three isolates of P. azaleae was confirmed by inoculating with a spore suspension 30 buds of 2 rhododendron plants (cv. Rosso scuro grande tardiva) grown in containers (14 cm diameter). Buds were punctured with a sterile needle before inoculation. Noninoculated plants served as controls. Wounded buds were covered with plastic bags to maintain high relative humidity, and all plants were maintained in growth chambers at 20°C for 9 days, and then transferred outdoors where temperatures were 20 to 25°C. Inoculated plants developed typical bud symptoms 20 days after inoculation, with 80% of inoculated buds showing symptoms. Control plants remained symptomless. The pathogen was consistently reisolated from artificially inoculated plants. In garden observations, different cultivars showed a wide range of susceptibility to the pathogen, mainly related to their flowering period. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of P. azaleae in Italy. Outbreaks of P. azaleae were previously reported in the United States (1), United Kingdom (2), and Germany (3).

16701,First Report of Choke Disease Caused by Epichloë baconii in the Grass Agrostis castellana.,"Agrostis castellana is common in semiarid natural grasslands of the province of Salamanca, Spain. In this area, plants showing fungal stromata in their stems were observed in July of 2001. These symptoms are typical of choke disease, caused by Epichloë species in several grasses (3). In this disease, external fungal stromata develop around the leaf sheath of the flag leaf during the reproductive cycle of the plant host. As a result, the inflorescence does not emerge. In natural populations of A. castellana, less than 1% of plants showed disease symptoms, and all the stems of infected plants were sterilized by stromata. Intercellular endophytic mycelium was observed by microscopy in stem pith of diseased plants, but not on samples of 30 apparently healthy plants (1). Ergovaline, a fungal alkaloid, was not detected in lyophilized samples of infected plant tissue (2). In a fungal culture obtained from surface-disinfected leaf sheaths of a diseased plant (1), reniform conidia and conidiophores characteristic of the genus Epichloë were observed (4). To determine the fungal species, the nucleotide sequence of the ITS1-5.8SrRNA-ITS2 region and the three first introns of the beta-tubulin gene were obtained (EMBL Accession Nos. AJ490938 and AJ490939). When compared to those of other Epichloë species, these sequences identified the fungus from A. castellana as E. baconii (3). This fungus has been previously described as a pathogenic fungal endophyte in other Agrostis and Calamagrostis species (3,4). The fact that all stems of infected plants were diseased, infection incidence was low, and no alkaloids were detected in plants suggests that this grass-endophyte interaction is pathogenic and not mixed or mutualistic.

Medicinal plants are associated with diverse fungal endophytes with potential bioactive properties. In this investigation, 26 fungal endophytes were isolated from D. integrifolia and three sterile forms using the Petri plate culture method. The endophytic isolation rate was highest for inflorescence (35.97%) and lowest for stem (15.61%). The highest colonization frequency was shown by F. solani (8.37%) and the lowest by Sterile morphotype 3 (1.36%). Out of the four plant parts, inflorescence was found to be highly infected, displaying an infection rate of 93.43% and the least infection occurred in the stem with 45%. The maximum number of isolated endophytic fungi belongs to the class Sordariomycetes, with a relative occurrence (%) of 71.72%. The Simpson’s diversity index reveals that the leaf endophytes were more diverse (0.94). Qualitative antifungal activity of the sporulating isolates against Curvularia lunata has shown that the maximum number of endophytes possessed Class 3 antagonism. Four isolates were selected based on screening of their antagonistic activity and their antifungal inhibition was calculated against nine fungal phytopathogens. Maximum inhibition (100%) was shown by Trichoderma sp. 2 (S2B2) against Alternaria alternata, A. brassicicola, Colletotrichum capsici, C. lunata, and Ustilaginoidea virens and least inhibition by Gliocladium sp. 1 (19.78%) against C. lunata. The four isolates were found to produce protease, lipase, amylase and cellulase enzymes. The isolates produced ammonia and hydrogen cyanide, but none of the isolates could solubilize phosphate.

8158,Genetic variability in the endophytic fungus Guignardia citricarpa isolated from citrus plants,"During some phases of of their life-cycle endophytic fungi colonize plants asymptomatically being found most frequently inside the aerial part of plant tissues. After surface disinfection of apparently healthy leaves from three varieties of mandarin orange and one tangor, and after incubation on appropriate culture medium, 407 fungal isolates were obtained, giving a total infection frequency of 81%. No fungal growth was observed from disinfected seeds, indicating that fungi are probably not transmitted via seeds. Of the fungal isolates, 27% belonged to the genus Guignardia, with 12 isolates being identified as Guignardia citricarpa Kiely, which is described as a citrus pathogen. The isolates were variable in respect to the presence of sexual structures and growth rates. Most of the isolates produces mature asci, supporting the hypothesis that they are nonpathogenic endophytes, which recently were identified as G. mangiferae. High intraspecific genetic variability (an average similarity coefficient of 0.6) was detected using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers generated by seven different primers. The highest similarity coefficient (0.9) was between isolates P15 and M86 and the smallest (0.22) between isolates P15 and C145.

12251,Cultivar-specific dynamics: unravelling rhizosphere microbiome responses to water deficit stress in potato cultivars,"BackgroundGrowing evidence suggests that soil microbes can improve plant fitness under drought. However, in potato, the world's most important non-cereal crop, the role of the rhizosphere microbiome under drought has been poorly studied. Using a cultivation independent metabarcoding approach, we examined the rhizosphere microbiome of two potato cultivars with different drought tolerance as a function of water regime (continuous versus reduced watering) and manipulation of soil microbial diversity (i.e., natural (NSM), vs. disturbed (DSM) soil microbiome).ResultsWater regime and soil pre-treatment showed a significant interaction with bacterial community composition of the sensitive (HERBST) but not the resistant cultivar (MONI). Overall, MONI had a moderate response to the treatments and its rhizosphere selected Rhizobiales under reduced watering in NSM soil, whereas Bradyrhizobium, Ammoniphilus, Symbiobacterium and unclassified Hydrogenedensaceae in DSM soil. In contrast, HERBST response to the treatments was more pronounced. Notably, in NSM soil treated with reduced watering, the root endophytic fungus Falciphora and many Actinobacteriota members (Streptomyces, Glycomyces, Marmoricola, Aeromicrobium, Mycobacterium and others) were largely represented. However, DSM soil treatment resulted in no fungal taxa and fewer enrichment of these Actinobacteriota under reduced watering. Moreover, the number of bacterial core amplicon sequence variants (core ASVs) was more consistent in MONI regardless of soil pre-treatment and water regimes as opposed to HERBST, in which a marked reduction of core ASVs was observed in DSM soil.ConclusionsBesides the influence of soil conditions, our results indicate a strong cultivar-dependent relationship between the rhizosphere microbiome of potato cultivars and their capacity to respond to perturbations such as reduced soil moisture. Our study highlights the importance of integrating soil conditions and plant genetic variability as key factors in future breeding programs aiming to develop drought resistance in a major food crop like potato. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms how plants recruit microbes from soil which help to mitigate plant stress and to identify key microbial taxa, which harbour the respective traits might therefore be an important topic for future research.","Martins, BR; Siani, R; Treder, K; Michalowska, D; Radl, V; Pritsch, K; Schloter, M",BMC MICROBIOLOGY,2023,10.1186/s12866-023-03120-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.981782978679412,TRUE,2,10,Low,no fungal taxa,amplicon; ITS; examined; observed; examined; studied,"Glycomyces, Marmoricola, Aeromicrobium, Mycobacterium and others) were largely represented.

Biological control is an important method to control common root rot of wheat. An endophytic bacterium, strain NEAU-242-2 was isolated from wheat seeds, which showed the strongest inhibitory activity against Bipolaris sorokiniana (84.2%) and also had strong broad-spectrum antifungal activity, with the inhibition rates over 61.2% against all phy-topathogens used in this study except for Rhizoctonia solani (44.5%), and was identified as Bacillus velezensis by 16S rRNA gene sequence and whole genome sequence and average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values. Pot experiments showed that strain NEAU-242-2 exhibited significant biocontrol effect (80.61 & PLUSMN; 1.22%) on common root rot of wheat in greenhouse. Furthermore, the sterile culture filtrate of strain NEAU-242-2 had strong inhibitory activity (86.96 & PLUSMN; 3.02%) against B. sorokiniana and the main antifungal substance was preliminarily identified as lipopeptides. The crude lipopeptide extracted from strain NEAU-242-2 showed strong antifungal activity (61.45 & PLUSMN; 3.45%) against B. sorokiniana with the IC50 of 25.93 & mu;g/ mL, and could cause mycelial wrinkle, fracture, and dehydrated malformation, destroy the structure of cell, and lead to cellular malformation and the disappearance of most membrane-like structures. Besides that, strain NEAU-242-2 could also conspicuously promote wheat seed germination and seedling growth. The fungistasis and plant growth-promoting activity of strain NEAU-242-2 were found to be associated with the production of IAA (19.4 & PLUSMN; 0.6 & mu;g/mL), siderophores, nitrogenases, cell wall-degrading enzymes (proteases and cellulases), and other active secondary metabolites. Additionally, a large number of genes related to antifungal and plant growth-promoting traits were also identified in the whole genome of strain NEAU-242-2.

16698,First Report of Sharp Eyespot of Wheat in Egypt.,"In 1998 and 1999, Rhizoctonia solani Kühn and R. cerealis van der Hoeven were isolated from lesions on basal leaf sheaths (2 to 4 cm above the soil level) of 48 wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell.). Plants were collected from 16 locations in Egypt in December 1998 (seedling stage) and March 1999 (adult stage). Disease incidence was approximately 20 and 30% during the 1998 to 1999 and 1999 to 2000 seasons, respectively. Mycelium was white to deep brown, branched at right angles with a septum near the branch, and a slight constriction at the branch base. Multinucleate cells and the production of irregular, brown black sclerotia in culture and on host plants were diagnostic of R. solani (1). Anastomosis groups AG-4 (30 isolates) and AG-1 (6 isolates) of R. solani, distinguished on the basis of hyphal fusion, were recovered. R. cerealis (12 isolates belonging to the anastomosis group CAG-1), which were slow-growing on potato dextrose agar, produced binucleate hyphal cells and yellow sclerotia. The 48 isolates were tested in the greenhouse for pathogenicity using cornmeal and sand inoculum prepared by mixing 3 g of infested cornmeal, 100 g of sand, and 20 ml of distilled water and incubating for 20 days at 28°C. Fifty milliliters of inoculum were added to 500 g of sterile soil in a 15-cm-diameter pot. There were six pots per isolate. Six pots containing noninfested soil were included as checks. Wheat (cv. Giza 160) seeds were disinfested by placing them in 5% of sodium hypochlorite for 5 min, and 10 seeds were planted in each pot. Twenty-five days after planting, an average of five plants survived in the pots treated with R. solani, and seven plants survived in pots treated with R. cerealis. All 10 plants in the noninfested pots survived and were symptomless. The surviving plants treated with R. solani developed a tan cortical rot of the root system and tan zonate lesions on the basal leaf sheaths. The lesions were oriented longitudinally with the stem and were irregular in shape with a white or light tan center surrounded by a wide, dark brown margin. Isolates of R. cerelis caused lesions on the base of the stem of young and mature plants. The lesions, which were larger than those caused by R. solani, were elliptic or ""eye"" shaped with a pale yellow center and sharply defined narrow border. The fungi were reisolated from the symptomatic tissue. Reference: (1) J. D. S. Clarkson and M. J. Griffin.

The cultivable fungi were isolated from the pelotons and roots, and the fungal ITS sequences were used for molecular identification. The community diversity of endophytic fungi in the roots were analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to evaluate the influence of different altitudes (1 177m, 1 409m and 1 590m) and the physical and chemical properties of rhizosphere soil in the same habitat on the diversity of endophytic fungi in the roots of C. appendiculata. The result was that 79 fungal isolates were identified as 19 species. Ascomycetes were dominant including two species of Dothideomycetes and 17 species of Sordariomycetes. Among them, 12 taxa belonged to orchid mycorrhizal fungi. In total, 80 fungal bands were detected by DGGE. Alternaria alternata, Ilyonectria destructans and Trichoderma spp. were obtained by culture method. In addition, three species of basidiomycetes, which were not detected by culture method, were newly detected by DGGE. The diversity of fungal community was related to altitude and significantly affected by nitrate nitrogen and available phosphorus in the rhizosphere soil.

15201,The application of the entomopathogenic fungus Akanthomyces muscarius modified GFP to study endophytization,"Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) of the genus Akanthomyces (formerly Lecanicillium) are one of the most common and important fungal entomopathogens, infecting sucking insects of the order Hemiptera mainly. The fungi can also parasitize on phytopathogenic fungi (rust, powdery mildew). The entomopathogens from these genera reported as endophytes in various plants under natural conditions [1–2], contributing to an increase in plant immunity to pathogens, as well as a decrease in plant colonization by pests. Endophytic colonization of plants by the fungus Akanthomyces lecanii can suppress the growth of the peach aphid [3]. Akanthomyces muscarius strains caused the death of moth when feeding on cabbage colonized by the fungus [4]. Endophytic properties were assessed using the A. muscarius (= Lecanicillium muscarium) strain Vl 72-GFP fluorescently labeled with GFP [5]. The transformation was done by electroporation of germinated conidia of the high-virulent “wild” strain Vl 72 by the pBARGPE1 vector harboring an eGFP gene, showed an expression of fluorescent protein without affecting fungal growth and virulence. The influence of the fungus on the growth rates of beans was revealed when leaves, sterile soil and seeds were treated with a suspension of conidia of 108 spores/ml. On the 7th day, stimulation of the growth of the stems and roots of the beans was observed when the seeds were soaked in a spore suspension of the fungus. When spraying the leaves, only the stem’s elongation was observed. The studied strain colonizes beans irregularly. When treating the seeds, the fungus was isolated in greater quantities from the roots (26%), when spraying the leaves — from the stem (36%), when watering the soil — also from the stem (43%). Infection of A. muscarius plants by spilling the soil was most effective. No effect of endophytization was found on the number of aphids after 14 days of aphid plant colonization. As a result of the introduction of the spores of Vl 72-GFP strain by shedding the soil under flower crops (lantana, gerbera, acanthus) in the greenhouse of Saint Petersburg Botanical Garden, this strain was isolated from the leaves of the Acanthus mollis L. after one month, which confirms the ability of this species to endophytic colonization of plants in greenhouse conditions.

1193,Fungal Endophyte Alternaria tenuissima Can Affect Growth and Selenium Accumulation in Its Hyperaccumulator Host Astragalus bisulcatus,"Endophytes can enhance plant stress tolerance by promoting growth and affecting elemental accumulation, which may be useful in phytoremediation. In earlier studies, up to 35% elemental selenium (Se-0) was found in Se hyperaccumulator Astragalus bisulcatus. Since Se-0 can be produced by microbes, the plant Se-0 was hypothesized to be microbe-derived. Here we characterize a fungal endophyte of A. bisulcatus named A2. It is common in seeds from natural seleniferous habitat containing 1,000-10,000 mg kg(-1) Se. We identified A2 as Alternaria tenuissima via 18S rRNA sequence analysis and morphological characterization. X-ray microprobe analysis of A. bisulcatus seeds that did or did not harbor Alternaria, showed that both contained >90% organic seleno-compounds with C-Se-C configuration, likely methylselenocysteine and glutamyl-methylselenocysteine. The seed Se was concentrated in the embryo, not the seed coat. X-ray microprobe analysis of A2 in pure culture showed the fungus produced Se-0 when supplied with selenite, but accumulated mainly organic C-Se-C compounds when supplied with selenate. A2 was completely resistant to selenate up to 300 mg L-1, moderately resistant to selenite (50% inhibition at similar to 50 mg Se L-1), but relatively sensitive to methylselenocysteine and to Se extracted from A. bisulcatus (50% inhibition at 25 mg Se L-1). Four-week old A. bisulcatus seedlings derived from surface-sterilized seeds containing endophytic Alternaria were up to threefold larger than seeds obtained from seeds not showing evidence of fungal colonization. When supplied with Se, the Alternaria-colonized seedlings had lower shoot Se and sulfur levels than seedlings from uncolonized seeds. In conclusion, A. tenuissima may contribute to the Se-0 observed earlier in A. bisulcatus, and affect host growth and Se accumulation. A2 is sensitive to the Se levels found in its host's tissues, but may avoid Se toxicity by occupying low-Se areas (seed coat, apoplast) and converting plant Se to non-toxic Se-0. These findings illustrate the potential for hyperaccumulator endophytes to affect plant properties relevant for phytoremediation. Facultative endophytes may also be applicable in bioremediation and biofortification, owing to their capacity to turn toxic inorganic forms of Se into non-toxic or even beneficial, organic forms with anticarcinogenic properties.","Lindblom, SD; Wangeline, AL; Barillas, JRV; Devilbiss, B; Fakra, SC; Pilon-Smits, EAH",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2018,10.3389/fpls.2018.01213,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.950388554415411,TRUE,2,10,Low,uncolonized,culture; 18s; rrna; ITS; observed,"with Se, the Alternaria-colonized seedlings had lower shoot Se and sulfur levels than seedlings from uncolonized seeds.

5589,Characteristics of bacteria from oilseed rape in relation to their biocontrol activity against Verticillium dahliae,"The potential of bacteria that are adapted to the oilseed rape root environment for use in the biological control of Verticillium dahliae, Kleb was investigated in both controlled and non-sterile growth conditions. Bacterial strains dominated by the red-pigmented members of enterobacteriaceae were isolated from thoroughly washed and air-dried root segments of symptomless young rape plants. Other associated strains found either belonged to Alcaligenes sp., Stenotrophomonas spp. and Pseudomonas spp. (Pseudomonas acidovorans and Pseudomonas putida) or were unidentified according to fatty acid methyl ester profile analysis. A total of 19 strains isolated in this study together with two previously studied strains, Serratia proteamaculans and Pseudomonas chlororaphis, were characterized on the basis of their interactions with V. dahliae and a number of functional characteristics. In line with earlier observations with root-colonizing fungi also from oilseed rape, all bacterial strains suppressed the pathogen not only directly and but also indirectly in in vitro assays. Mechanisms of suppression were apparently multifold among the strains, but production of hydrogen cyanide does not seem to be involved in indirect inhibition. The majority of the strains possessed the ability to produce cellulases, proteases and phosphatases and some even produced chitinases and induced hypersensitive responses, indicating their potential for nutrient acquisition as well as colonization capacity and active recognition by the plant cells. Investigations in non-sterile field soil revealed that some strains protected rape plants from V. dahliae partly by delaying symptom development. None of the strains, however, was strongly deleterious to rape growth either in the presence or absence of the pathogen. Light microscopic observations of roots and results based on agar printing techniques revealed the potential of the studied strains to colonize or interfere with the pathogen colonization. This study provides some insight into the evolved relationship of bacterial residents with their host in terms of their potential importance in its fitness.","Alström, S",JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY,2001,10.1046/j.1439-0434.2001.00585.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.986904855125144,TRUE,2,10,Low,sterile,isolated; agar; sterile; ITS; investigated; studied,NA,"controlled and non-sterile growth conditions.

5677,"Elucidation of the life cycle of the endophytic genus Muscodor and its transfer to Induratia in Induratiaceae fam. nov., based on a polyphasic taxonomic approach","Molecular phylogenetic studies of cultures derived from some specimens of plant-inhabiting Sordariomycetes using ITS, LSU, rpb2 and tub2 DNA sequence data revealed close affinities to strains of Muscodor. The taxonomy of this biotechnologically important genus, which exclusively consists of endophytes with sterile mycelia that produce antibiotic volatile secondary metabolites, was based on a rather tentative taxonomic concept. Even though it was accommodated in Xylariaceae, its phylogenetic position had so far remained obscure. Our phylogeny shows that Muscodor species have affinities to the xylarialean genera Emarcea and Induratia, which is corroborated by the fact that their sexual states produce characteristic apiospores. These data allow for the integration of Muscodor in Induratia, i.e. the genus that was historically described first. The multi-locus phylogenetic tree clearly revealed that a clade comprising Emarcea and Induratia forms a monophylum separate from representatives of Xylariaceae, for which we propose the new family Induratiaceae. Divergence time estimations revealed that Induratiaceae has been diverged from the Xylariaceae + Clypeosphaeriaceae clade at 93 (69-119) million years ago (Mya) with the crown age of 61 (39-85) Mya during the Cretaceous period. The ascospore-derived cultures were studied for the production of volatile metabolites, using both, dual cultures for assessment of antimicrobial effects and extensive analyses using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antimicrobial effects observed were significant, but not as strong as in the case of the previous reports on Muscodor species. The GC-MS results give rise to some doubt on the validity of the previous identification of certain volatiles. Many peaks in the GC-MS chromatograms could not be safely identified by database searches and may represent new natural products. The isolation of these compounds by preparative chromatography and their subsequent characterisation by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy or total synthesis will allow for a more concise identification of these volatiles, and they should also be checked for their individual contribution to the observed antibiotic effects. This will be an important prerequisite for the development of biocontrol strains.","Samarakoon, MC; Thongbai, B; Hyde, KD; Broenstrup, M; Beutling, U; Lambert, C; Miller, AN; Liu, JK; Promputtha, I; Stadler, M",FUNGAL DIVERSITY,2020,10.1007/s13225-020-00443-9,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.684420529217874,TRUE,2,10,Low,sterile,isolation; sterile; ITS; observed; studied; checked,"of Muscodor.

17558,"First Report of Blight Caused by Sclerotium rolfsii on the Invasive Exotic Weed, Vincetoxicum rossicum (Pale Swallow-Wort), in Western New York.","Pale (Vincetoxicum rossicum) and black swallow-wort (V. nigrum) are perennial, twining vines that are increasingly invasive in natural and managed ecosystems in the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada. Both species, introduced from Europe in the 1800s, are listed as noxious weeds or banned invasive species by the USDA-Natural Resource Conservation Service. Observations by C. Southby, a local naturalist, over several years at a meadow populated by pale swallow-wort in Powder Mill Park, Monroe County, NY, revealed a gradual disappearance of pale swallow-wort with restoration of native grasses and some dicotyledonous plant species, in a 6.7-m-diameter area. Diseased swallow-wort plants had extensive yellowing and wilting of foliage, likely due to splitting of the basal stem, with white mycelium throughout the stem and crown; small, reddish brown sclerotia were evident, but roots were not affected. Stem tissue sections from 20 symptomatic plants were vacuum infiltrated with 2% NaOCl for 20 min, then plated onto malt yeast agar and potato dextrose agar amended with 60 mg/liter of penicillin and 80 mg/liter of streptomycin, resulting in development of fast-growing, white mycelium which then formed numerous, irregularly shaped (2 to 4 mm diameter), reddish brown sclerotia at the plate edges. Two individual cultures were identified as S. rolfsii (1) based on size, shape, and color of the sclerotia and presence of characteristic clamp connections in the mycelium. The isolate was suspected to be S. rolfsii var. delphinii due to the reported inability of S. rolfsii to persist in regions with extremely low winter temperatures (4), but molecular data showed otherwise. Sequences of the 18S gene (GenBank JN543690), internal transcribed spacer region (JN543691), and 28S gene (JN543692) of the ribosomal DNA identified the isolate, VrNY, as S. rolfsii (2,3). Pathogenicity tests were conducted with individual 2-month-old seedlings of V. rossicum and V. nigrum grown in steam-sterilized Metromix 360 in SC10 polypropylene conetainers in a growth chamber with a diurnal cycle of 25/20°C, a photoperiod of 14-h light/10-h dark, and fertilized at 3 week intervals. Two independent replications of 12 plants of each species were each inoculated at the stem base with a 4-mm-diameter mycelial agar plug from the growing edge of a colonized plate. The agar plug was held in place with 5 g of sterile sand. Control plants (12 of each species per replication) were treated with sterile agar plugs. Plants for each treatment were placed within a clear plastic bag to maintain 90% relative humidity for 72 h, and then removed from the bags. Disease symptoms developed over 21 days, with >90% of inoculated plants showing symptoms within 2 weeks. Control plants were symptomless. Incidence of mortality was 66 and 60% for V. rossicum and V. nigrum, respectively, by 3 weeks. The fungus reisolated from diseased stem and crown tissue produced characteristic mycelium with irregular sclerotia, consistent with those of S. rolfsii. Since spread of this fungus is based on movement of soilborne sclerotia, this isolate may offer potential as a bio-herbicide for control of swallow-wort in natural ecosystems if the isolate can be demonstrated to have a host range restricted to this invasive weed.

16972,Occurrence of Botrytis cinerea on Pelargonium spp. in Argentina.,"Pelargonium spp. are perennial ornamental plants used as potted plants or bedding plants in gardens. During the spring and summer of 2003, symptoms of an unknown disease appeared on florists' geranium (Pelargonium inquinans (L.) L'Herit) and ivy geranium (P. peltatum (L.) L'Herit.) adult plants growing in gardens in the suburbs of Buenos Aires. Flowers showed small, water-soaked spots that expanded and eventually blighted the petals. Brown, circular to irregular, water-soaked spots developed in leaves and advanced into the peduncules. A fungus was isolated from diseased leaf tissue on potato dextrose agar after surface disinfestations in 2% NaOCl for 2 min. Pure cultures formed a whitish, dense mycelial mat and turned gray after 72 h. Conidia were ellipsoid, hyaline, nonseptate, and were formed on botryose heads with an average size of 8.6 × 10.2 μm. Black, round, and irregular sclerotia developed on 7-day-old cultures with an average size of 1.1 × 1.7 mm. Morphological characteristics agree with those described for B. cinerea Pers.:Fr (1). Pathogenicity tests were conducted. Five 3-month-old plants of each host were spray inoculated with a conidial suspension (1 × 106 conidia/ml).

13025,Diversity of endophytic fungi from six dominant plant species in a Pb-Zn mine wasteland in China,"The fungi which cause asymptomatic infections in living plant tissues are called endophytic fungi. They comprise diverse groups of fungi and may protect their host plants against the insect pests and phytopathogens, as well as increase hosts fitness in extreme environments. In order to document the ecological relationship between endophytic fungi and their host plants which grown in heavy metal contaminanted soils, the endophytic fungal diversity, the dominant fungi and their host specificity of six dominant plant species (Arabis hirsuta, Acacia decurrens, Symplocos paniculata, Rabbosia eriocalyx, Arenaria serpyllifolia and Rosa longicuspis) collected from the Huize Pb-Zn mine wasteland of Yunnan Province, southwest China, were investigated. A total of 495 culturable endophytic fungi were isolated from 690 stems and leaf segments of the six plant species. The isolation rate of the endophytic fungi in the six plant species ranged from 0. 42 to 0. 93, and the mean isolation rate was 0. 72. The highest isolation rate appeared in R. eriocalyx, and the lowest isolation rate appeared in Ro. longicuspis. It was found that the isolation rate of the endophytic fungi in the stems was significantly higher than that in the leaves (P<0. 05, t test) in the six plant species. Based on their morphological characteristics, the way of spore production and spore characteristics, the sporulating isolates were identified to genus level. Non-sporulating isolates were identified as mycelia sterile and sorted into different groups based on the colony surface texture, hyphal pigmentation and growth rates after two months sporulation. The fungi were identified to 20 taxa, of which Phoma and Peyronellaea were the dominant endophytic fungi. The endophytic fungal richness of the six plant species was different. The highest endophytic fungal richness appeared in Ara. hirsuta, R. eriocalyx and Ro. longicuspis, from which 13 endophytic fungal taxa were obtained. While, the lowest richness appeared in Aca. decurrens and only nine taxa were found in it. Each plant species harboured one to two dominant fungi. The dominant fungi of Ara. hirsuta, Aca. decurrens and R. eriocalyx were Phoma and Peyronellaea, the relative frequency of them were 47. 22% and 27. 78%, 73. 33% and 16%, 48. 21% and 27. 68%, respectively. Alternaria was the dominant fungi of S. paniculata, the relative frequency was 46. 67%. The dominant fungi of Are. serpyllifolia were Alternaria and Peyronellaea, the relative frequency was 26. 74% and 25. 58%, respectively. The dominant fungi of Ro. longicuspis were Phoma and Alternaria, the relative frequency was 33. 34% and 15. 56%, respectively.

16731,First Report of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-cucumerinum on Cucumber in Spain.,"During December 1999, root and stem rot was observed on greenhouse-grown cucumber (cvs. Albatros, Brunex, Acapulco, and Cerrucho) plants in Almería, Spain, using rock wool cultures. The disease caused severe damage, estimated at a loss of up to 75% of the plants, in the first greenhouse affected; afterward, the disease was found in eight additional greenhouses (14 ha) in 1999 and 2000. Stem lesions extended up to 10 to 12 cm above the crown in mature plants, although no fruit damage was observed. In the advanced stages, abundant development of orange sporodochia was evident on crown and stem lesions, without vascular discoloration. Root, crown, and stem pieces that were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) after surface-disinfection with 5% sodium hypochlorite, rinsed, and dried resulted in pure fungal colonies. Based on morphological characteristics of conidia, phialides, and chlamydospores from the isolations, the fungus was identified as Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtend.:Fr. Pathogenicity tests were conducted on cucumber (cvs. Marketmore 76 and Cerrucho [F1 hybrid]), melon (cvs. Amarillo oro, Perlita, Piboule, Tania, and Nipper [F1]), watermelon (cvs. Sugar Baby, Sweet Marvel, Jubilee, and Pata Negra and hybrid Crimson sweet), Cucurbita maxima × Cucurbita moschata, zucchini (cv. Senator), and loofah (Luffa aegyptiaca) at several stages: (i) pregermination; (ii) 1 or 2 true leaves; and (iii) more than 10 true leaves. Five fungal isolates were grown on PDA or shaken potato dextrose broth at 25°C for 8 days. Inoculation was performed in pots (10 seeds or plants of each cultivar or hybrid and isolate) by drenching with 100 ml of a fungal suspension (104 to 106 CFU/ml). Sterile water was applied to noninoculated control plants. Tests were repeated in growth chambers at 25°C (night) and 28°C (day) with a 16-h photoperiod. Fifteen to fifty days after inoculation, cucumber and melon plants at all three stages developed symptoms of root and crown rot in 100% of inoculated plants, with no observed vascular discoloration. Fifty days after inoculation, all three stages of C. maxima × C. moschata and zucchini remained symptomless. Loofah and watermelon germinated poorly or not at all when inoculated at the pregermination stage. Fifteen to fifty days after inoculation, 100% of inoculated cucumber and melon plants developed symptoms. Watermelon plants inoculated at the 10 or more true-leaf stage did not develop disease symptoms. No symptoms developed on noninoculated control plants. F. oxysporum was reisolated from infected roots, crowns, and stems of inoculated plants, confirming Koch's postulates. The main symptoms on cucumber infected by F. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum are wilt, yellowing, and vascular discoloration. In contrast, based on inoculation of the host differentials and the resulting disease symptoms found in this study, the fungus was identified as F. oxysporum f. sp. radicis-cucumerinum (1).

16905,Blight Caused by Sclerotium rolfsii on Potted Ornamental Citrus in Sicily.,"Approximately 140,000 container-grown ornamental citrus plants are produced each year in the province of Catania (eastern Sicily). In the spring of 2006, a severe blight was observed in a commercial nursery in Catania on 2-month-old rooted cuttings of lemon (Citrus limon (L.) Burm.) and calamondin (× Citrofortunella mitis (Blanco) J. W. Ingram & H. E. Moore). Approximately 80% of the nursery stock of 2,000 cuttings was affected. Cuttings were grown in 7.5-cm2 pots made with compressed peat and wood pulp at 28 to 30°C with 95 to 100% relative humidity on benches in a greenhouse, The pot mix was composed of peat, perlite, and soil (2:1:2). Cuttings showed a dark brown necrotic lesion at the base of the stem that extended upward, resulting in chlorosis and wilting of the leaves. An invasive, white, cottony mycelium with a fan-like pattern and numerous, small, brown spherical sclerotia (0.5 to 4.0 mm in diameter) developed on infected tissues, in the potting mix as well as on the pot wall. Herbaceous cuttings collapsed within 2 weeks while woody cuttings gradually died. Symptomatic basal stem sections were disinfected for 1 min in 1% NaOCl, rinsed in sterile water, and plated on acidified (pH 4.5) potato dextrose agar (PDA). Isolations consistently yielded a fungus whose morphological characters corresponded to Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc. On PDA, it produced a septate mycelium with clamp connections and numerous olive brown-to-clove brown sclerotia (1 to 3 mm in diameter). Pathogenicity of two S. rolfsii isolates (IMI 396204 and IMI 396205) from citrus was confirmed on 3-month-old lemon cuttings grown in 10-cm-diameter plastic pots filled with a sterilized mix of peat moss and vermiculite (3:1) (10 cuttings for each isolate). Each pot was inoculated with 15 sclerotia harvested from 6-week-old cultures on PDA and placed on the soil surface around the base of the cutting. Ten noninoculated cuttings served as the control. Cuttings were kept in a growth chamber at 28°C and relative humidity at >95%. All inoculated cuttings showed wilting, blight, and stem rot within 3 weeks after inoculation. White mycelium and sclerotia were produced on the stem base and soil surface. Noninoculated controls remained symptomless. S. rolfsii was reisolated from infected cuttings. The pathogenicity test was repeated once with calamondin cuttings and the results were similar. Blight caused by S. rolfsii is widespread in nurseries of ornamentals in Italy (1). However, to our knowledge, this is the first report of this disease on potted ornamental citrus. Probably high temperature and moisture during rooting were conducive to the disease.

1175,Stable coexistence or competitive exclusion? Fern endophytes demonstrate rapid turnover favouring a dominant fungus,"Fungal endophytes are critical members of the plant microbiome, but their community dynamics throughout an entire growing season are underexplored. Additionally, most fungal endophyte research has centred on seed-reproducing hosts, while spore-reproducing plants also host endophytes and may be colonized by unique community members. In order to examine annual fungal endophyte community dynamics in a spore-reproducing host, we explored endophytes in a single population of ferns, Polystichum munitum, in the Pacific Northwest. Through metabarcoding, we characterized the community assembly and temporal turnover of foliar endophytes throughout a growing season. From these results, we selected endophytes with outsized representations in sequence data and performed in vitro competition assays. Finally, we inoculated sterile fern gametophytes with dominant fungi observed in the field and determined their effects on host performance. Sequencing demonstrated that ferns were colonized by a diverse community of fungal endophytes in newly emerged tissue, but diversity decreased throughout the season leading to the preponderance of a single fungus in later sampling months. This previously undescribed endophyte appears to abundantly colonize the host to the detriment of other microfungi. Competition assays on a variety of media types failed to demonstrate that the dominant fungus was competitive against other fungi isolated from the same hosts, and inoculation onto sterile fern gametophytes did not alter growth compared to sterile controls, suggesting its effects are not antagonistic. The presence of this endophyte in the fern population probably demonstrates a case of repeated colonization driving competitive exclusion of other fungal community members.","Younginger, BS; Stewart, NU; Balkan, MA; Ballhorn, DJ",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2023,10.1111/mec.16732,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.971391438277559,TRUE,2,10,Low,sterile,isolated; sterile; sequencing; ITS; observed,"with outsized representations in sequence data and performed in vitro competition assays.

5494,Distribution of Plasmopara viticola Causing Downy Mildew in Russian Far East Grapevines,"Downy mildew is a severe disease that leads to significant losses in grape yields worldwide. It is caused by the oomycete Plasmopara viticola. The study of the distribution of this agent and the search for endophytic organisms that inhibit the growth of P. viticola are essential objectives to facilitate the transition to sustainable and high-yield agriculture, while respecting the environment. In this study, high-throughput sequencing of the ITS (ITS1f/ITS2 region) and 16S (V4 region) amplicons was employed to analyze 80 samples of leaves and stems from different grapevine species and cultivars grown in the Russian Far East (Vitis amurensis Rupr., Vitis coignetiae Pulliat, and several grapevine cultivars). The analysis revealed the presence of P. viticola in 53.75% of the grape samples. The pathogen P. viticola was not detected in V. amurensis samples collected near Vladivostok and Russky Island. Among the P. viticola-affected samples, only two (out of the eighty analyzed grape samples) from the Makarevich vineyard in Primorsky Krai exhibited disease symptoms, while the majority appeared visually healthy. We also found six distinct P. viticola ASVs in our metagenomic data. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we hypothesize that the P. viticola population in the Russian Far East may have originated from the invasive P. viticola clade aestivalis, which has spread around the world from North America. To identify putative microbial antagonists of P. viticola, a differential analysis of high-throughput sequencing data was conducted using the DESeq2 method to compare healthy and P. viticola-affected samples. The in silico analysis revealed an increased representation of certain taxa in healthy samples compared to P. viticola-affected ones: fungi-Kabatina sp., Aureobasidium sp., and Vishniacozyma sp.; bacteria-Hymenobacter spp., Sphingomonas spp., Massilia spp., Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum spp., and Chryseobacterium spp. This in-silico-obtained information on the potential microbial antagonists of P. viticola serves as a theoretical basis for the development of biocontrol agents for grapevine downy mildew.","Nityagovsky, NN; Ananev, AA; Suprun, AR; Ogneva, ZV; Dneprovskaya, AA; Tyunin, AP; Dubrovina, AS; Kiselev, KV; Sanina, NM; Aleynova, OA",HORTICULTURAE,2024,10.3390/horticulturae10040326,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985933824816546,TRUE,2,10,Low,not detected,metagenom*; sequencing; ITS; ITS2; analyzed; collected,"presence of P. viticola in 53.75% of the grape samples.

16508,First Report of Alternaria alternata Causing Leaf Spot on English Walnut.,"A foliar disease of English walnut (Juglans regia L.) was observed in 1998 in an orchard in northern Italy. Symptoms consisted of circular, necrotic spots bordered with concentric zones of darker tissue. Average lesion diameter was 20 mm, although lesions could extend to half of the leaflet lamina. A fungus identified as Alternaria alternata (Fr.:Fr.) Keissl. (1) was observed on the necrotic tissue and was consistently isolated from the margins of the necrosis. Conidia from leaves were brown, ellipsoid to ovoid (primary conidia 28 to 60 × 8 to 15 μm; secondary conidia 10 to 30 × 7 to 13 μm), with walls often ornamented, 1 to 6 transversely septate and 0 to 3 longitudinally septate. For pathogenicity tests, three isolates were grown on potato dextrose agar for 2 weeks. Inoculations were performed on detached, surface-sterilized, healthy J. regia leaflets. Four drops (5 μl each) of a sterile water suspension of 1 × 105 conidia per ml were placed on each leaflet; three leaves per isolate were used. Leaves were incubated in a moist chamber.

6991,Fungal endophytes from Dioscorea zingiberensis rhizomes and their antibacterial activity,"Aims: The aim of the study was to isolate and characterize the endophytic fungi from the rhizomes of the Chinese traditional medicinal plant Dioscorea zingiberensis and to detect their antibacterial activities. Methods and Results: After strict sterile sample preparation, nine fungal endophytes were isolated from rhizomes of the Chinese traditional medicinal plant D. zingiberensis. The endophytes were classified by morphological traits and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA gene sequence analysis. Their ITS rDNA sequences were 99-100% identical to Nectria, Fusarium, Rhizopycnis, Acremonium and Penicillium spp. respectively. Of these, the most frequent genera were Fusarium and Nectria. One isolate, Dzf7, was unclassified on the basis of its low sequence similarity. The next closest species was Alternaria longissima (c. 92.4% sequence similarity). Endophyte isolate Dzf5 showed the closest sequence similarity (c. 99.5%) to an uncultured soil fungus (DQ420800) obtained from Cedar Creek, USA. Bioassays using a modified broth dilution test were used to detect the antibacterial activity of n-butanol extracts of both mycelia and culture filtrates of D. zingiberensis showed biological activity against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli and Xanthomonas vesicatoria. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the extracts were between 31.25 mu g ml(-1) and 125 mu g ml(-1). Conclusions: Endophytic fungus Dzf2 (c. 99.8% sequence similarity to Fusarium redolens) isolated from D. zingiberensis rhizome showed the most potent antibacterial activities.

463,Transcriptome sequencing of Salvia miltiorrhiza after infection by its endophytic fungi and identification of genes related to tanshinone biosynthesis,"Context: Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Labiatae) is a traditional Chinese herb. Endophytic fungi, which are biotic elicitors, can induce accumulation of secondary metabolites in their host plants. Objective: To analyze the interaction mechanism between S. miltiorrhiza and endophytic fungi. Materials and methods: Endophytic fungi U104 producing tanshinone IIA were isolated from the healthy disease-free tissue of root of S. miltiorrhiza by conventional methods. The endophytic fungus U104 of S. miltiorrhiza was co-cultured with the sterile seedlings of S. miltiorrhiza for 20?d (temp:day/night = 26??C/18??C, photoperiod:12/12?h, illuminance:2000?Lx). Transcriptome sequencing of S. miltiorrhiza seedlings after 20?d of co-cultivation was performed using the Illumina platform. Results: A total of 3713 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained. These different expression genes, such as STPII, LTP2, MYB transcription factors, CNGC, CDPK, Rboh, CaM, MAP2K1/MEK1, WRKY33, SGT1/SGT and Hsp90/htpG, showed that host S. miltiorrhiza had biological defence response in the initial stage of interaction. Under the induction of endophytic fungi, 14?key enzyme genes were up-regulated in the tanshinone biosynthesis pathway: DXS, DXS2, DXR, HMGR3, AACT, MK, PMK, GGPPS2, GPPS, KSL, IDI, IPII, FDPS and CPS. Discussion and conclusions: A total of 14?key genes were obtained from the tanshinone component synthesis and metabolic pathways, providing a reasonable explanation for the accumulation of tanshinone components, an accumulation induced by endophytic fungi, in the host plants. The large amounts of data generated in this study provide a strong and powerful platform for future functional and molecular studies of interactions between host plants and their endophytic fungi.","Jiang, Y; Wang, L; Lu, SR; Xue, YZ; Wei, XY; Lu, J; Zhang, YY",PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGY,2019,10.1080/13880209.2019.1680706,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995672726886371,TRUE,2,10,Low,sterile,cultured; isolated; sterile; sequencing; illumina,"miltiorrhiza by conventional methods.

340,Spatial Segregation and Aggregation of Ectomycorrhizal and Root-Endophytic Fungi in the Seedlings of Two Quercus Species,"Diverse clades of mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi are potentially involved in competitive or facilitative interactions within host-plant roots. We investigated the potential consequences of these ecological interactions on the assembly process of root-associated fungi by examining the co-occurrence of pairs of fungi in host-plant individuals. Based on massively-parallel pyrosequencing, we analyzed the root-associated fungal community composition for each of the 249 Quercus serrata and 188 Quercus glauca seedlings sampled in a warm-temperate secondary forest in Japan. Pairs of fungi that co-occurred more or less often than expected by chance were identified based on randomization tests. The pyrosequencing analysis revealed that not only ectomycorrhizal fungi but also endophytic fungi were common in the root-associated fungal community. Intriguingly, specific pairs of these ectomycorrhizal and endophytic fungi showed spatially aggregated patterns, suggesting the existence of facilitative interactions between fungi in different functional groups. Due to the large number of fungal pairs examined, many of the observed aggregated/segregated patterns with very low P values (e.g., < 0.005) turned non-significant after the application of a multiple comparison method. However, our overall results imply that the community structures of ectomycorrhizal and endophytic fungi could influence each other through interspecific competitive/facilitative interactions in root. To test the potential of host-plants' control of fungus-fungus ecological interactions in roots, we further examined whether the aggregated/segregated patterns could vary depending on the identity of host plant species. Potentially due to the physiological properties shared between the congeneric host plant species, the sign of hosts' control was not detected in the present study.

321,MORPHO-MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI FROM THREE TRADITIONAL MEDICINAL PLANTS,"The present study focuses on the occurrence of endophytic fungi harboured in the healthy tissues of the three medicinal plants, namely, Adhatoda vasica Nees, Cassia alata L., and Ocimum sanctum L., during the monsoon and winter seasons. Using the ""Tissue Planting"" method, 19 endophytic fungi were isolated from the leaves and stem of those plants and subsequently identified through morphological characteristics and molecular approaches. From all plants employed in this investigation, Aspergillus flavus, A. niger (Type I), A. niger (Type II), A. terreus, Colletotrichum sp., Penicillium sp.1, Pestalotiopsis mangiferae, and white sterile mycelium were isolated. To delve deeper, ten of these isolates underwent characterization via internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region amplification, and the sequence results obtained utilizing the ITS1 and ITS4 primers were cross-referenced with NCBI GenBank database system through BLAST analysis. The phylogenetic tree generated by the UPGMA method grouped the endophytic fungi into different clades on the basis of genetic distances. Cladosporium xanthochromaticum, Colletotrichum siamense, Fusarium incarnatum, and Talaromyces pinophilus have been recorded for the first time from Bangladesh.

11115,Phosphate utilization by the fungal root endophyte Piriformospora indica,"The root endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica increases plant resistance and tolerance to stress and promotes plant growth, but its ability to support plant nutrition is still controversially discussed. Irrespective of a potential nutrient transport towards the plant, the fungus might release P from sources unavailable for plant usage by transformation to available forms. To test this hypothesis, sterile solid and liquid in vitro cultures of P. indica supplied with different organic and inorganic P sources were established. Cultures were investigated for growth, solubilised P, enzyme activities, RNA accumulation of the four genes encoding phosphate transporters and the two genes for acid phosphatases and phytases respectively found in P. indica genome, and for pH values in the media. P. indica growth was higher in the presence of inorganic P than in organic P sources. Significant amounts of P were solubilised by P. indica from Ca-3(PO4)(2) and rock phosphate. However, no relevant intra- or extracellular enzymatic activity was detected despite RNA accumulation of related genes. In general, the genes were all repressed by higher amounts of inorganic P and were expressed the most when the fungus received phytate. We observed a decrease in medium pH in the presence of P. indica irrespective of the P source. P. indica is able to solubilise phosphate from inorganic, but not from organic P sources. This P solubilisation is not due to enzymatic activities but rather to the lowering of the medium pH.","Ngwene, B; Boukail, S; Söllner, L; Franken, P; Andrade-Linares, DR",PLANT AND SOIL,2016,10.1007/s11104-015-2779-8,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.773096676977386,TRUE,2,9,Low,sterile,medium; sterile; ITS; observed; investigated,"from sources unavailable for plant usage by transformation to available forms.

Embryos isolated from freshly collected seeds were 100% sterile, even though the seeds were not treated with acid or soaked in water prior to culturing. The embryo germination level of non-leached seeds was slightly lower (85%) than those leached in running water for 7 d (100%). The leached embryos germinated with extended roots while the non-leached embryos had abnormal shapes. The embryos cultured on media supplemented with an absorbent (PVP or activated charcoal) had extended roots and shoots and were a larger size without any browning, as compared to those grown without the supplement; activated charcoal gave better results. There were no significant differences in germination rates of T. baccata embryos between the media with differing strengths of macronutrients; however, for further development of the shoot, it was necessary to sub-culture the seedlings in MS in the light. To obtain seedlings with longer roots, they had to be maintained in one-half strength MS in darkness. Approximately 90% of the plants survived when grown hydroponically for 2 mo. The surviving plants showed well-extended roots and were a good starting material for genomic, proteomic, and conservational studies as well as Taxol permeabilization investigations.","Tafreshi, SAH; Shariati, M; Mofid, MR; Nekui, MK",IN VITRO CELLULAR & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY-PLANT,2011,10.1007/s11627-011-9369-0,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.579097714290795,TRUE,2,9,Low,sterile,cultured; isolated; culture; sterile; collected,NA,"leached embryos germinated with extended roots while the non-leached embryos had abnormal shapes.

17339,MAT gene idiomorphs suggest a heterothallic sexual cycle in a predominantly asexual and important pine pathogen.,"Diplodia pinea (=Sphaeropsis sapinea) is a well-known and economically important latent pathogen of Pinus spp. in many parts of the world. Despite intensive scrutiny, its sexual state has never been observed and the fungus has thus been considered exclusively asexual. It was, therefore, surprising that a recent population genetics study showed high genotypic diversity and random association of alleles in a number of populations, suggesting that the pathogen has a cryptic sexual stage. Using the genome sequence of two individual D. pinea isolates, we interrogated the structure of the MAT locus in this fungus. The results suggested that D. pinea is heterothallic (self-sterile) with complete and apparently functional copies of the MAT genes containing the α-1 and HMG domains present in different isolates. In addition to the MAT1-2-1 and MAT1-1-1 genes, we found a MAT1-1-4 gene in the MAT1-1 idiomorph and a novel MAT1-2-5 gene in the MAT1-2 idiomorph. Importantly, the frequencies of occurrence of both idiomorphs in populations examined were not significantly different from a 1:1 ratio, which would be expected in sexually reproducing populations.

Fluorescent protein-expressing H. oryzae was used to monitor the colonization pattern. Hyphae invaded from the epidermis to the inner cortex, but not into the root stele. Fungal colonization increased with root tissue maturation, showing no colonization in the meristematic zone, slight colonization in the elongation zone, and heavy colonization in the differentiation zone. H. oryzae adopted a biotrophic lifestyle in roots accompanied by programmed cell death. Real-time PCR facilitated the accurate quantification of fungal growth and the respective plant response. The biocontrol potential of H. oryzae was visualized by inoculation with eGFP-tagged M. oryzae in rice. H. oryzae protected rice from M. oryzae root invasion by the accumulation of H2O2 and elevated antioxidative capacity. H. oryzae also induced systemic resistance against rice blast. This systemic resistance was mediated by the OsWRKY45-dependent salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway, as indicated by the strongly upregulated expression of OsWRKY45. The colonization pattern of H. oryzae was consistent with the typical characteristics of DSEs. H. oryzae enhanced local resistance by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and high antioxidative level and induced OsWRKY45-dependent SA-mediated systemic resistance against rice blast.","Su, ZZ; Mao, LJ; Li, N; Feng, XX; Yuan, ZL; Wang, LW; Lin, FC; Zhang, CL",PLOS ONE,2013,10.1371/journal.pone.0061332,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.980761926019629,TRUE,2,9,Low,no colonization,pcr; real-time pcr; ITS; visualized; investigated,"cortex, but not into the root stele.

231,"Isolation and morphological identification of endophytic fungi from leaves and stems of Aquilaria malaccensis Lamk. originating from Java Island, Indonesia","Aims: Endophytic fungi are the remarkable category of host-associated fungal community that invades the intercellular regions of host tissues, benefiting their host while obtaining an advantage. Fungal endophytes have lately attracted prominence as a source of active secondary metabolites. This investigation aimed to identify fungal endophytes that reside inside the leaves and stems of Aquilaria malaccensis.Methodology and results: Healthy A. malaccensis stems and leaves samples were collected. Clean leaves and stems were cut to a size of 1 cm, followed by sterilization using 75% ethanol for 1 min, 3% sodium hypochlorite solution for 1 min, and finally, rinsing with sterile water 3 times for 1 min and drying with sterile paper. The sterile samples were put onto Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) media containing chloramphenicol for 7-14 days until the mycelium grew for morphological identification under a light microscope. Five endophytic fungi were recovered from leaves, while nine endophytic fungi were obtained from stems. Using morphological approaches, nine of the endophytes had observed to produce conidia fungi, whereas the others did not.

19101,Development of a TaqMan Real-Time PCR for Early and Accurate Detection of Anthracnose Pathogen Colletotrichum siamense in Pachira glabra.,"Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum siamense, is a destructive disease of Pachira glabra in southern China. Early and proper monitoring and quantification of C. siamense is of importance for disease control. A calmodulin (CAL) gene-based TaqMan real-time PCR assay was developed for efficient detection and quantification of C. siamense, which reliably detected as low as 5 pg of genomic DNA and 12.8 fg (5800 copies) of target DNA. This method could specifically recognize all tested C. siamense isolates, while no amplification was observed in other closely related Colletotrichum species. The assay could still detect C. siamense in plant mixes, of which only 0.01% of the tissue was infected. A dynamic change in the amount of C. siamense population was observed during infection, suggesting that this real-time PCR assay can be used to monitor the fungal growth progression in the whole disease process. Moreover, the method enabled the detection of C. siamense in naturally infected and symptomless leaves of P. glabra trees in fields. Taken together, this specific TaqMan real-time PCR provides a rapid and accurate method for detection and quantification of C. siamense colonization in P. glabra, and will be useful for prediction of the disease to reduce the epidemic risk.",Gu J; Wang H; Huang X; Liao L; Xie H; Peng X,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2024,10.3390/plants13081149,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.983160588890497,TRUE,2,9,Low,no amplification,pcr; real-time pcr; TaqMan; observed; tested,"copies) of target DNA.

5321,Utilization of endophytic strain Bacillus sp SBER3 for biodegradation of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in soil model system,"Total eight endophytic bacteria were isolated from the roots of Populus deltoides growing in non-contaminated sites at natural vegetation of Garhwal Himalayas, Uttarakhand, India. Among these eight, only SBER3 isolate was able to metabolize wide range of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and other hydrocarbon used in the study i.e. anthracene, naphthalene, benzene, toluene and xylene on minimal salt basal medium (MSB) as sole source of carbon and energy. It was identified as Bacillus sp. on the basis of 16S rDNA sequence. Furthermore, quantitatively Bacillus sp. SBER3 was able to produced 22 mu g ml(-1) of IAA after 4 days and solubilized 0.96 mu g ml(-1) of available phosphorus respectively after 120 h. In addition, Bacillus sp. SBER3 also produced siderophore and 1 aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase. Along with these traits, SBER3 under in vitro condition inhibited the phytopathogenic fungi Rhizoctonia solani, Macrophomina phaseolina, Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani with (percent growth inhibition) PGI of 60%, 61.5%, 64.3% and 12%, respectively. Microscopic examination under the influence of Bacillus sp. SBER3 revealed abnormalities of mycelia structure in case of R. solani, F. oxysporum and M. phaseolina. Although, mean growth rate and survival under varying osmotic stress regime were also evaluated under in vitro condition. Interestingly, in liquid culture medium Bacillus sp. SBER3 reduced appreciable amount i.e. 83.4% and 75.1% of anthracene and naphthalene, respectively after 6 days of incubation. Notwithstandingly, isolate SBER3 proved to be a competent rhizobacteria in rhizosphere niche in treatments T-1 (Sterile soil + plant cuttings + bacterization) and T-2 (sterile soil + anthracene + plant cuttings + bacterization). Rhizoremediation potential of Bacillus sp. SBER3 was demonstrated in polyaromatic hydrocarbon contaminated soil model system. Significant enhancement in shoot, root length, root and shoot biomass including stem girth of P. deltoides with respective to control was also recorded and concurrently endophytic isolate Bacillus sp.

11383,Fungal Assemblages Associated with Roots of Halophytic and Non-halophytic Plant Species Vary Differentially Along a Salinity Gradient,"Structure of fungal communities is known to be influenced by host plants and environmental conditions. However, in most cases, the dynamics of these variation patterns are poorly understood. In this work, we compared richness, diversity, and composition between assemblages of endophytic and rhizospheric fungi associated to roots of two plants with different lifestyles: the halophyte Inula crithmoides and the non-halophyte I. viscosa (syn. Dittrichia viscosa L.), along a spatially short salinity gradient. Roots and rhizospheric soil from these plants were collected at three points between a salt marsh and a sand dune, and fungi were isolated and characterized by ITS rDNA sequencing. Isolates were classified in a total of 90 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), belonging to 17 fungal orders within Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Species composition of endophytic and soil communities significantly differed across samples. Endophyte communities of I. crithmoides and I. viscosa were only similar in the intermediate zone between the salt marsh and the dune, and while the latter displayed a single, generalist association of endophytes, I. crithmoides harbored different assemblages along the gradient, adapted to the specific soil conditions. In the lower salt marsh, root assemblages were strongly dominated by a single dark septate sterile fungus, also prevalent in other neighboring salt marshes. Interestingly, although its occurrence was positively correlated to soil salinity, in vitro assays revealed a strong inhibition of its growth by salts. Our results suggest that host lifestyle and soil characteristics have a strong effect on endophytic fungi and that environmental stress may entail tight plant-fungus relationships for adaptation to unfavorable conditions.","Maciá-Vicente, JG; Ferraro, V; Burruano, S; Lopez-Llorca, LV",MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,2012,10.1007/s00248-012-0066-2,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.989682089814021,TRUE,2,9,Low,sterile,isolated; sterile; sequencing; ITS; collected,"In the lower salt marsh, root assemblages were strongly dominated by a single dark septate sterile fungus, also prevalent in other neighboring salt marshes.

3011,Ectomycorrhizal Inocybe species associate with the mycoheterotrophic orchid Epipogium aphyllum but not its asexual propagules,"Epipogium aphyllum is a Eurasian achlorophyllous, mycoheterotrophic forest orchid. Due to its rarity, it is often protected, and its biology is poorly known. The identity and pattern of colonization of fungal associates providing carbon to this orchid have not been studied previously. Using samples from 34 individuals from 18 populations in Japan, Russia and France, the following were investigated: (a) colonization patterns of fungal associates of E. aphyllum by microscopy; (b) their identity by PCR amplification of nuclear ribosomal ITS carried out on rhizome fragments and hyphal pelotons. Microscopic investigations revealed that thick rhizomes were densely colonized by fungi bearing clamp-connections and dolipores, i.e. basidiomycetes. Molecular analysis identified Inocybe species as exclusive symbionts of 75 % of the plants investigated and, more rarely, other basidiomycetes (Hebeloma, Xerocomus, Lactarius, Thelephora species). Additionally, ascomycetes, probably endophytes or parasites, were sometimes present. Although E. aphyllum associates with diverse species from Inocybe subgenera Mallocybe and Inocybe sensu stricto, no evidence for cryptic speciation in E. aphyllum was found. Since basidiomycetes colonizing the orchid are ectomycorrhizal, surrounding trees are probably the ultimate carbon source. Accordingly, in one population, ectomycorrhizae sampled around an individual orchid revealed the same fungus on 11 center dot 2 % of tree roots investigated.

5912,Plant Growth Promotion and Biocontrol Potentiality of Endophytes Isolated from Root Nodules of Sulla flexuosa L. Plants,"Legumes, native to the Mediterranean, harbor reservoirs of endophytes that help plants adapt to various environmental stresses. The current study was carried out to evaluate the plant growth characteristics and antifungal activity of root nodule endophytes as biocontrol agents and plant growth promoters. Eleven bacterial endophytes isolated from root nodules of Sulla flexuosa L. grown in Northwest Morocco were assessed for their plant growth-promoting (PGP), and antifungal properties. Four endophytic bacteria were selected for their efficiency in solubilizing inorganic phosphate. The selected strains were positive for more than 2 PGP traits, including indole acetic acid, ACC deaminase, siderophore, and ammonia production. The screening for lytic enzyme production revealed that all strains were capable of producing chitinase, cellulase, catalase, and protease, while the secretion of amylase and urease was not detected. The HFB11 was the only strain incapable of producing pectinase. In vitro experiments revealed the strains' potential to withstand salt and drought stresses by being able to grow in high concentrations of NaCl and PEG. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the strains were identified as Enterobacter and Serratia. The antagonistic activity of the strains against Botrytis cinerea, Aspergillus ochraceus, and Fusarium oxysporum was detected and they were shown to inhibit the fungal growth with various percentages. The highest percentage of inhibition was observed for HFB3 against B. cinerea with 50% inhibition followed by HFB8 which was able to inhibit 47% of F. oxysporum's growth. In contrast, a weak inhibition was observed against A. ochraceus. All these findings indicate that the chosen endophytes, halotolerant Serratia inhibens HFB8 and Enterobacter hormaechei HFB11, might be used as candidates for effective biocontrol and growth promotion of legumes.","Hamane, S; El Yemlahi, A; Zerrouk, MH; El Galiou, O; Laglaoui, A; Bakkali, M; Arakrak, A",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY,2023,10.1155/2023/2451806,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.940064546815689,TRUE,2,9,Low,not detected,isolated; rrna; sequencing; observed; assessed,NA,"activity of root nodule endophytes as biocontrol agents and plant growth promoters.

16977,First Report of Thielaviopsis Trunk Rot of Date Palm in Italy.,"As an alternative to Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis Chabaud), date palm (P. dactylifera L.) is being planted in Sicilian landscapes. In January 2006, severe symptoms of trunk rot were noticed on 10 7- to 8-m high mature date palms in the central square of Aci Bonaccorsi (Catania) in eastern Sicily. In June 2004, these palms were transplanted directly from Egypt. In 4 of 13 planted date palms, the canopy suddenly fell off the trunk. The canopy of all palms appeared normal and healthy with no stem bleeding observed before trunk collapse. Cross sections of affected date palms revealed a brown rot of nonlignified or lightly lignified tissues along with a strong odor of fermented fruit (amyl acetate) associated with the presence of Geotrichum candidum Link ex Pers. Brown rot was not detected in three of the date palms examined. Symptoms were not detected on lignified and external fibers. Internal tissue adjacent to the rotted areas was placed on carrot agar amended with 500 μl of streptomycin sulfate and acidified (lactic acid; pH = 3.6) potato dextrose agar. Large sections (10 to 18 cm) of affected palm tissues were maintained in a moist chamber for 8 days. Microscopic examinations of five single-conidia isolates on media and sporulation from affected tissues yielded Thielaviopsis paradoxa De Seyn. (Höhn) (1). Endoconidia measuring 3 to 5.5 × 7 to 11 μm were cylindrical to somewhat oval when mature, hyaline to mid brown and smooth walled. Endoconiodophores were usually straight, colorless to pale brown, as much as 150 μm long, with a terminal spore-bearing cell through which spores are born. Chlamydospores were smooth, thick walled, brown, in chains, and were 7.5 to 13 μm width × 10 to 18 μm length (values referred to 50 examined chlamydospores). T. paradoxa is a pathogen that can infect any part of a palm and its pathogenicity to date palm is well documented (3). T. paradoxa is endemic in northern Italy (Ligurian Riviera) on P. canariensis where it causes a disease known as bud rot (2). To our knowledge, this is the first record of trunk rot caused by T. paradoxa on date palm in Italy and is the first report of the fungus in Sicily. It is recommended to avoid the foreign trade of mature date palms from known infected areas because of the symptomless infections by this pathogen. References: (1) A. R. Chase and T. K.

The relative frequency, isolation rate and colonisation rates of endophytes were used to study the endophytic diversity. The results showed that the highest colonisation rate (93.05%) was observed in Adhathoda vasica, while it was 91.66% in Ocimum sanctum, 85% in Viola odorata, 82.81% Cannabis sativa and lowest (61.11%) in Withania somnifera. Moreover, reading the richness and diversity of the endophytic fungi, the highest was obtained for O. sanctum, W. somnifera and C. sativa having eight species each, while lowest (6 and 4) was obtained from A. vasica and V. odorata, respectively.

7230,Endosphere mycobiome in mature rice roots originate from both seedlings and soils,"Plant-fungus symbioses have functional relevance during plant growth and development. However, it is still unknown whether the endosphere fungi in mature plants originated from soils or seeds. To elucidate the origination of endosphere fungi in mature rice roots, the fungal communities in surface sterilized roots and shoots of mature rice plants germinated in soils, rhizosphere soils and seedlings germinated under sterile conditions were analyzed by Illumina-based sequencing and compared. Total 62 fungal OTUs shared in the seedlings, shoots and roots, 126 OTUs shared in the rhizosphere soils, shoots and roots. Fungal OTUs coexisted in the four types of samples belonged to genera of Rhizophagus, Trichoderma, Fusarium, Atractiella, Myrmecridium, Sporothrix, Microdochium, Massariosphaeria, and Phialemonium. The principle component analysis (PCA) and NMDS plot suggested that the fungal community structure in rhizosphere soils was different from that in seedlings significantly. Rhizosphere soil, shoot and root contained more similar fungal community. The fungal community in seedling was similar to that in shoot and root of mature plants. The results suggested that endophytic fungal communities in mature rice plants originated from both seedlings and rhizosphere soils, and more fungal taxa originated from rhizosphere soils. Mature rice plants contain mycobiome transmitted vertically from seeds, which suggests that inoculation of endophytic fungi isolated from seedlings might be an effective way to introduce beneficial fungal inoculants into rice plants successfully.","Duan, XL; Zhou, RH; Cao, LX",BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY,2024,10.1007/s42770-024-01384-0,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.744464374027332,TRUE,2,9,Low,sterile,isolated; sterile; sequencing; illumina; analyzed,"and shoots of mature rice plants germinated in soils, rhizosphere soils and seedlings germinated under sterile conditions were analyzed by Illumina-based sequencing and compared.

10744,Diversity of sterile root-associated fungi of two Mediterranean plants,"The diversity of dark sterile mycelia (DSM) associated with the roots of neighboring healthy ectomycorrhizal Pinus halepensis and endomycorrhizal Rosmarinus officinalis plants in a Mediterranean ecosystem in Italy was investigated to assess taxonomic affinities of these poorly known root endophytes. More than 260 fungal isolates were obtained and ascribed to distinct morphotypes based on their macro- and microscopic features. Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequence analyses of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) and 18S rDNA regions were carried out for representatives of the morphotypes obtained from both hosts over an 11-yr period. Molecular evidence matched morphological group circumscription. Recognition of systematic affinities was possible with varying degrees of resolution for the different morphotypes. Morph 2 was closely related to Rhizopycnis vagum (within Dothideomycetidae), Morph 1 to Diaporthe Phomopsis (within Sordariomycetidae), whereas Morphs 3a, 3b, 3c and 3d could only be given taxonomic placement at a higher level (Dothideomycetidae and Chaetothyriomycetidae). This peculiar systematic spectrum suggests that actual DSM diversity in nature is still largely underestimated.

2734,Transmission of the locoweed endophyte to the next generation of plants,"Locoweed species of the legume genera Astragalus and Oxytropis (Fabaceae) contain the toxic alkaloid swainsonine, and poison livestock in semi-arid regions throughout the world. Recently, the endophyte Undifilum oxytropis (previously characterized as Embellisia spp.) was found in species of Astragalus and Oxytropis, and was shown to produce swainsonine. A survey of major locoweed species was conducted throughout the western U.S. in 2005 to verify the presence of the endophyte and swainsonine. Seed from these plants was collected to verify the transmission of the endophyte to progeny. In study 1, seed from each parent plant from which the endophyte could be cultured was germinated and seedlings were grown for 4-6 months and then harvested. The presence and quantity of the endophyte was determined by real-time PCR, and swainsonine concentration by LC/MS. The endophyte was transmitted to nearly all of the progeny, however, it was extremely low (< 0.38 pg endophyte DNA/ng total DNA) in 15 % of the samples, and swainsonine was near the detection threshold or not detected. In the remaining 85 % of the samples, the endophyte ranged from 3.2 to 36.2 pg ng(-1), and swainsonine concentration ranged from 0.21 % to 0.79 %. In study 2, seeds were taken from parent plants in the original 2005 survey from which the endophyte could not be cultured, though its presence was detected by PCR. The seeds were germinated and seedlings were grown for 4 months. The endophyte was detected by PCR in 94 % of the progeny, but the amounts were very low (< 0.29 pg ng(-1)) and swainsonine was not detected in any of the samples. It appears that U. oxytropis has near perfect (approaching 100 %) vertical transmission to the next generation of seedlings. However, a small proportion of the progeny had low endophyte/low or no swainsonine, and this characteristic was inherited in the next generation.

4277,Identification and characterisation of causal pathogens of Pestalotiopsis leaf fall disease in Hevea brasiliensis using a detached leaf technique,"Pestalotiopsis leaf fall disease (PLFD) has emerged as a significant and detrimental foliar disease affecting Hevea brasiliensis in Malaysia since 2017. The disease poses a severe threat to rubber plantations, leading to economic losses and impacting the country's rubber industry. Understanding the factors contributing to lesion incidence and the potential presence of a fungal complex is crucial for effective disease management. This study aimed to address key objectives, including the identification of primary fungal pathogens responsible for lesion development and examination of the role of co-infections in lesion incidence. To achieve these objectives, five fungal isolates (Neopestalotiopsis surinamensis, Colletotrichum conoides, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Phyllosticta fallopiae and Letendraea cordylinicola) previously identified through the Internal Transcribe Spacer (ITS) regions were subjected to in vitro artificial inoculation experiments on detached rubber leaves. Various combinations of these fungal isolates were tested to evaluate their interactions as possible causal pathogens of PLFD. Three variables were assessed, viz. type of water source (sterile distilled water and rainwater), presence of leaf wounds, and inoculation techniques (conidial suspensions and mycelial agar plugs). Lesion incidence was evaluated based on sporulating occurrences on the detached leaves, recorded seven days after inoculation. Statistical analysis, including non-parametric Pearson's chi-square tests revealed that the fungal isolates Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Colletotrichum conoides and Neopestalotiopsis surinamensis were the primary contributors to lesion incidence, accounting for 83%, 69%, and 57% of cases, respectively. The study also revealed that lesion incidence was not significantly influenced by inoculation techniques or type of water source but was greater in wounded leaves compared to unwounded leaves. Co-inoculation experiments demonstrated increased lesion incidence, highlighting the role of co-infections in disease severity. Importantly, this study elucidated a potential fungal complex associated with PLFD and provided insights into its epidemiology. The findings contribute to deeper understanding of the disease, offering valuable guidance for effective disease management strategies in H. brasiliensis cultivation in Malaysia.","Ismail, MZH; Mahyudin, MM; Noran, AS; Zambri, AMA; Maiden, NA; Atan, S; Aris, MNM",JOURNAL OF RUBBER RESEARCH,2024,10.1007/s42464-024-00243-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.980874866019584,TRUE,2,9,Low,sterile,agar; sterile; ITS; assessed; tested; evaluated,NA,"distilled water and rainwater), presence of leaf wounds, and inoculation techniques (conidial suspensions and mycelial agar plugs).

16909,First Report of Alternaria alternata f. sp. cucurbitae Causing Alternaria Leaf Spot of Melon in the Mid-Atlantic Region of the United States.,"Alternaria alternata f. sp. cucurbitae, the casual agent of Alternaria leaf spot, was first described in Greece where it caused severe losses to greenhouse-grown cucumbers (Cucumis sativus) (3,4). The fungus also attacks melon (C. melo) and watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) (1-3). In late June of 2006, following a period of windy and rainy days, numerous dark brown, circular lesions, 0.5 to 1 mm in diameter, were observed on leaves of melons in a field in Wicomico County, Maryland. The lesions gradually enlarged and coalesced into large, nearly circular, or irregularly shaped lesions that could be as long as 3 cm. The center of the lesions was light tan, surrounded by a dark brown ring and a chlorotic halo, and tended to split in the later development stages. Most of the lesions appeared on the edge of the leaves and no lesions developed on the stems and fruit. Lesions first started on old leaves and then developed on leaves in the middle part of the canopy. Leaf lesions were observed on melon cvs. Ananas, Honeydew Greenflesh, and Israeli. Disease severity ranged from 3 to 20% of the leaf area affected. Small pieces (3 × 3 mm) of tissue removed from the margin between healthy and diseased tissue were surface disinfected in 0.5% NaOCl for 2 min and plated on acidified, ¼-strength potato dextrose agar. Isolations made from diseased tissue frequently (61%) yielded fungal colonies with morphological features and spore dimensions that were consistent with the description of A. alternata f. sp. cucurbitae (1,3). Fungal isolates were characterized by small, short-beaked, multicellular conidia. Conidia were ovoid, obclavate, and sometimes ellipsoidal with the average overall body length of 39 μm (range, 17 to 80 μm) and width of 14 μm (range, 7 to 20 μm). Conidia were produced on short conidiophores in chains. The beaks were short (often less than one-third the body length) and conical or cylindrical. Pathogenicity of six single-spore isolates was determined on four melon cultivars (Honeydew Greenflesh, Israeli, Tam Dew, and Topmark) and one watermelon cultivar (Sugar Baby) in a greenhouse. Twenty plants of each cultivar at the one-true-leaf stage were sprayed with a conidial suspension (106 conidia/ml) of each isolate amended with 0.1% (vol/vol) of Tween 20 until runoff (1.5 to 2 ml per plant). Inoculation with sterile distilled water amended with 0.1% Tween 20 served as controls. The plants were placed in a dew growth chamber for 48 h at 24°C and subsequently maintained in a greenhouse at 21 to 29°C. At 4 to 5 days after inoculation, each isolate induced leaf lesions on each inoculated cultivar similar to typical lesions observed in the field. There was no significant difference in disease severity among the cultivars tested or between melon and watermelon. Control plants remained symptomless. The fungus was readily reisolated from symptomatic tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. alternata f. sp. cucurbitae causing Alternaria leaf spot of melon in the Mid-Atlantic United States and the only report outside Georgia in the southern region of the United States (D. B. Langston, personal communication) and Greece. References: (1) D. L. Vakalounakis. Plant Dis. 74:227, 1990. (2) D. L. Vakalounakis. Ann. Appl. Biol. 117:507, 1990. (3) D. L. Vakalounakis.

2079,"Colonization of cacao seedlings by Trichoderma stromaticum, a mycoparasite of the witches' broom pathogen, and its influence on plant growth and resistance","Trichoderma stromaticum, a mycoparasite of the cacao witches' broom pathogen Moniliophthora perniciosa, is being used in Bahia, Brazil to control the disease under field conditions. The endophytic potential of this biocontrol agent was studied in both shoot and root tissues of sterile and nonsterile cacao and bean seedlings. Agar plate and light and electron microscopy studies showed that T stromaticum is able to colonize extensively both cacao and bean plants grown under sterile conditions. However, colonization was lower when plants were grown under nonsterile conditions, especially in the shoot tissues. Recovery of T stromaticum from field-grown trees showed that isolates belonging to genetic group II are more persistent (> 120 days) as endophytes than isolates from group 1. Endophytic colonization of cacao plants by T stromaticum did not result in plant growth promotion nor induced resistance against M perniciosa on seedlings that had been treated 30 days prior to application of the pathogen. These results were confirmed by Northern blot studies, where the fungus was unable to alter the expression of selected genes involved in plant defense such as ChiB, a putative class VII chitinase, Glu-1, a putative endo-1,4-beta-glucanase, Caf-1, a putative caffeine synthase, and Per-1 apoplastic quiacol peroxidase, genes involved in the regulation of plant growth TcORFX-1(fw2.2-like) and TcLhca-1(photosystem I 24 kDa protein) involved in energy production. This study indicates that induced resistance and growth promotion are not responsible for the activity of T. stromaticum in the biocontrol of the witches' broom pathogen. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Leaves and stems of P. perrottettii and leaves of T. guianensis were sampled in the dry and wet season. Stems of T. guianensis were also sampled in the wet season. Endophytes were isolated by an adapted trituration and particle filtration protocol. A total of 1,615 isolates representing 99 species and 20 sterile morphotypes were recovered; 64 morphospecies occurred as singletons. The number of isolates and species was higher in the wet season. Leaves of P. perrottettii were less densely colonized than other organs studied, but were the most species-rich. Conversely, stems of T. guianensis yielded more isolates but were less species-rich. Both plants were found to harbor similar but distinguishable endophytic assemblages. The Jaccard's index of similarity between the fungal assemblages of both plants was 0.82, higher than found for other plants in similar habitats. The fungal species composition seemed to be influenced by the collection season and organ type, as demonstrated by multivariate correspondence analysis. Paraconiothyrium brasiliense, P. sporulosum and Verticillium leptobactrum were the dominant species in P. perrottettii. In leaves of T. guianensis, Pseudocercospora sp., Phomopsis sp. 1 and Lecanicillium psalliotae were the most frequent, while Stagonospora sp. 1 and Phomopsis sp. 1 were the dominant endophytes in its stems. The results indicated that some of the dominant endophytic taxa isolated in this study colonize different hosts and plant organs while others seem to exhibit a high degree of host or organ recurrence.

3202,MICROFUNGI FROM CARPINUS-CAROLINIANA,"The microfungal flora and community structure of the bark of Carpinus caroliniana is described as perceived by a direct isolation method. Twenty-four bark discs were removed from 10 trees at five different sites in New Jersey and West Virginia and applied to three different isolation media. From 1200 bark discs from 50 trees, 155 species of fungi were isolated. The overall recovery rate was 11.5 species/tree. A medium with cycloheximide gave the highest species recovery rates and isolated the highest percentage of all the species recovered. A medium of malt-yeast extract gave the most isolates but lowest species recovery rate. Eleven of the 12 dominant species were preferentially isolated on one of the three isolation media. The community structure of the fungi recovered from Carpinus bark exhibited the typical dominance-diversity curve that has been reported for other saprobic fungal communities. Generally, the floristic composition was similar to the bark of other tree species previously studied in temperate deciduous forests. The total number of isolates was dominated by a few species of ubiquitous epiphytic taxa, but a large percentage of the species recovered appeared either at a single site or on a single tree. Sterile isolates accounted for 39% of the species and Coelomycetes for 13% of the species. The sites from West Virginia had a significantly higher recovery rate of species per tree than the New Jersey sites. In a search for fungi for potential biotechnological applications, bark is an easily utilized and rich resource.

202,"Diversity and bioactive potential of endophytic fungi from Nothapodytes foetida, Hypericum mysorense and Hypericum japonicum collected from Western Ghats of India","Endophytic fungi are major contributors to fungal diversity and an important component of plant microbiota. Plants growing in biodiversity hotspots and having ethnobotanical utility are often explored for the presence of endophytic fungi with bioactive potential. Western Ghat mountains of India are one of the ten famous biodiversity hotspots in the world. Hence, in the present study, we investigated the diversity of endophytic fungi associated with tissues of Nothapodytes foetida (a tree), Hypericum mysorense (a shrub) and Hypericum japonicum (a herb) collected from forests of Western Ghats with emphasis on diversity of endophytic fungi harbored in different tissues of three plants and their antimicrobial and free radical scavenging activities.

All isolates belonged to Dothidiomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes of the phylum Ascomycota. Most frequent colonizers were Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Gliocladium, Cladosporium, Trichoderma, Colletotrichum, and Pestalotiopsis. Endophytes showed neither any host preference nor any dominance of a single species. Ethyl acetate extracts of 39 endophytic fungi exhibited antimicrobial activity against one or more pathogens, of which the activity of Bionectria ochroleuca NOTL33, Chaetomium globosum HYML55, Alternaria brassicae HYMS01, Aspergillus sp. HYML56 was prominent against most of the pathogens tested. 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) free radicals were effectively quenched by the ethyl acetate extracts of 28 isolates and 34 isolates, respectively.

12388,Phylogeny and taxonomy of obscure genera of microfungi,"The recently generated molecular phylogeny for the kingdom Fungi, on which anew classification scheme is based, still suffers from an under representation of numerous apparently asexual genera of microfungi. In an attempt to populate the Fungal Tree of Life, fresh samples of 10 obscure genera of hyphomycetes were collected. These fungi were subsequently established in culture, and subjected to DNA sequence analysis of the ITS and LSU nrRNA genes to resolve species and generic questions related to these obscure genera. Brycekendrickomyces (Herpotrichiellaceae) is introduced as a new genus similar to, but distinct from Haplographium and Lauriomyces. Chalastospora is shown to be a genus in the Pleosporales, with two new species, C. ellipsoidea and C. obclavata, to which Alternaria malorum is added as an additional taxon under its oldest epithet, C. gossypii. Cyphellophora eugeniae is newly described in Cyphellophora (Herpotrichiellaceae), and distinguished from other taxa in the genus. Dictyosporium is placed in the Pleosporates, with one new species, D. streliziae. The genus Edenia, which was recently introduced for a sterile endophytic fungus isolated in Mexico, is shown to be a hyphomycete (Pleosporales) forming a pyronellea-like synanamorph in culture. Thedgionia is shown not to represent an anamorph of Mycosphaerella, but to belong to the Helotiales. Trochophora, however, clustered basal to the Pseudocercospora complex in the Mycosphaerellaceae, as did Verrucisporota. Vonarxia, a rather forgotten genus of hyphomycetes, is shown to belong to the Herpotrichiellaceae and Xenostigmina is confirmed as synanamorph of Mycopappus, and is shown to be allied to Seifertia in the Pleosporales. Dichotomous keys are provided for species in the various genera treated. Furthermore, several families are shown to be polyphyletic within some orders, especially in the Capnodiales, Chaetothyriales and Pleosporales.","Crous, PW; Braun, U; Wingfield, MJ; Wood, AR; Shin, HD; Summerell, BA; Alfenas, AC; Cumagun, CJR; Grohenewald, JZ",PERSOONIA,2009,10.3767/003158509X461701,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98476187305805,TRUE,2,9,Low,sterile,isolated; culture; sterile; ITS; collected,"with one new species, D. streliziae.

11536,Fungal microbiome of barley grain revealed by NGS and mycological analysis,"Introduction. Barley can be infected with a broad variety of fungi, which can cause considerable loss of crop yield and reduce the quality of grain. Modern vision on the geographical and ecological distribution and biodiversity of micromycetes has been established by traditional, cultivation-based methods. However, more recently, molecular methods have shifted microbiological research to a new level, making it possible to investigate hidden taxonomical biodiversity. Study objects and methods. For this study, we determined the fungal biome on the surface and inside of barley grains using the traditional mycological method and the contemporary molecular method, which employed DNA metabarcoding based on NGS (next-generation sequencing) of the ITS2 region. We analyzed five cultivars that were collected in two subsequent crop seasons (2014, 2015). Results and discussion. DNA metabarcoding revealed 43 operational taxonomic units, while 17 taxa of genus or species level were recovered by the traditional method. DNA metabarcoding revealed several minor species and one predominant, presumably plant-pathogenic Phaeosphaeria sp., which were not detected in the agar plate-based assay. Traditionally, Fusarium fungi were identified by mycological assay. However, the resolution of DNA metabarcoding was sufficient to determine main Fusarium groups divided by ability to produce toxic secondary metabolites. The combined list of Ascomycetes consisted of 15 genera, including 14 fungi identified to species level. The list of Basidiomycota derived from DNA metabarcoding data alone included 8 genera. Conclusion. It was found that crop season predetermines the fungal community structure; mycobiota on the surface and inside of grain was significantly different.","Kazartsev, IA; Gagkaeva, TY; Gavrilova, OP; Gannibal, PB",FOODS AND RAW MATERIALS,2020,10.21603/2308-4057-2020-2-286-297,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.977062923580612,TRUE,2,8,Low,not detected,agar; sequencing; ITS2; analyzed; collected,"DNA metabarcoding revealed several minor species and one predominant, presumably plant-pathogenic Phaeosphaeria sp., which were not detected in the agar plate-based assay.

Maize seedlings (var. Nithyashree) were inoculated with conidial suspensions and were examined for endophytic establishment in leaf and stems at different intervals during 15-90 days after treatment. All six isolates showed colonization in stem and leaf tissues with varying abilities of colonization and persistence. The mean percent colonization ranged from 7.41 to 20.37 % in older stem tissues and 3.70 to 21.29 % in young stem tissues and in leaf, it ranged from 6.46 to 27.78 % in older leaf tissues and 11.11 to 26.85 % in young leaf tissues. Among six isolates tested, Bb-23 isolate recorded the maximum mean colonization in older stem (20.37 %), older leaf (27.78 %) and in young stem (21.29 %). Bb-5a isolate showed maximum mean colonization in young leaf tissues (26.85 %). Persistence of inoculated fungal isolates decreased with increase in age of the plant. No physical symptoms of damage were observed in any of the B. bassiana treated plants. No colonization of B. bassiana was observed in the untreated control maize plants.

1425,"Two new endophytic Atractiellomycetes, Atractidochium hillariae and Proceropycnis hameedii","Sterile fungal isolates are often recovered in leaf and root endophytic studies, although these seldom play a significant role in downstream analyses. The authors sought to identify and characterize two such endophytesone representing the most commonly recovered fungal isolate in recent studies of needle endophytes of Pinus taeda and the other representing a rarely isolated root endophyte of Populus trichocarpa. Both are shown by DNA sequencing to be undescribed species of Atractiellomycetes (Pucciniomycotina, Basidiomycota), a poorly characterized class of mostly plant-associated and presumably saprobic microfungi. The authors describe the new genus and species Atractidochium hillariae (Phleogenaceae) and the new species Proceropycnis hameedii (Hoehnelomycetaceae), both in the Atractiellales, to accommodate these unusual isolates. Following incubations of 1-2 mo, A. hillariae produces minute white sporodochia, similar to those produced by several other members of Atractiellales, whereas Pr. hameedii forms conidia singly or in chains in a manner similar to its sister species Pr. pinicola. Additionally, we provide a taxonomic revision of Atractiellomycetes based on multilocus analyses and propose the new genera Neogloea (Helicogloeaceae) and Bourdotigloea (Phleogenaceae) to accommodate ex-Helicogloea species that are not congeneric with the type H. lagerheimii. Atractiellomycetes consists of a single order, Atractiellales, and three families, Hoehnelomycetaceae, Phleogenaceae, and Helicogloeaceae.

17889,Multi-trait PGP rhizobacterial endophytes alleviate drought stress in a senescent genotype of sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench].,"Root-tissue colonizing bacteria demonstrated with multiple PGP traits from sorghum plants were identified as Ochrobactrum sp. EB-165, Microbacterium sp. EB-65, Enterobacter sp. EB-14 and Enterobacter cloacae strain EB-48 on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Here, the in vivo experiments using ½-MS media and ½-MS media + 15% PEG 8000 (for inducing drought stress) indicated stress tolerance imparting ability of these rhizobacterial endophytes in a non-stay green and senescent genotype (R-16) of sorghum. In the experiment with sterile soilrite mix base, seed bacterization with these isolates showed improved plant growth specifically the roots, in terms of root length (~ 44.2 to 50.8% over controls), root dry weight (~ 91.3 to 99.8% over controls) and root surface area (~ 1 to 1.5 fold over controls) under drought stress. Rhizobacterial endophytes were successful, not only in providing better cellular osmotic adjustment in leaves (≥ 1-fold increase in proline accumulation over controls), but favorable physiological responses like Relative Water Content (RWC) and cell Membrane Stability Index (MSI) in the inoculated plants during the drought stress induction. Up-regulation of drought responsive genes like sbP5CS2 and sbP5CS1 was observed in these endophytes-treated plants as compared to untreated control and Escherichia coli DH5α (negative control)-treated plants. Interestingly, the stress imparting traits of rhizobacterial endophytes, including up-regulation of specific genes, were observed during sorghum seedling growth only under drought stresses.

18735,Dominant foliar endophytes influence soybean yield and transcriptome.,"Microorganisms associated with plants can affect nutrient and water acquisition, plant defenses, and ecological interactions, with effects on plant growth that range from beneficial to antagonistic. In Glycine max (soybean), many studies have examined the soil microbiome and the legume-rhizobium relationship, but little is known about foliar endophytes, their effects on plant biomass and fitness, and how plants respond to their presence. To address these questions, we inoculated Glycine max with field-collected isolates of previously isolated, dominant strains of Methylobacterium and Colletotrichum in either sterile or non-sterile soil. We then used RNAseq to compare the transcriptomic responses of plants to single- and co-inoculation of endophytes. We found that all endophyte treatments increased soybean growth compared to control, but only in sterile soil. These results suggest context-dependency, with endophytes serving as facultative mutualists under stress or nutrient deprivation. Similarly, transcriptomic analyses revealed that soybean defense and stress responses depended on the interaction of endophytes; Methylobacterium elicited the strongest response but was modulated by the presence of Colletotrichum.

15629,Rapid and specific detection of the poplar black spot disease caused by marssonina brunnea using loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay,"Marssonina brunnea is the main pathogen that causes poplar black spot disease, which leads to the decrease of the photosynthetic efficiency and significantly affects the production and quality of timber. Currently, no in-field diagnostic exists for M. brunnea. Here, we described a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the rapid and sensitive detection of M. brunnea. A set of six oligonucleotide primers was designed to recognize eight distinct sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of M. brunnea. The LAMP assay was optimized by the combination of high specificity, sensitivity, and rapidity for the detection of less than 10 pg/µL of target genomic DNA in 60 min per reaction at 65◦C, whereas with PCR, there was no amplification of DNA with concentration less than 1 ng/µL. Among the genomic DNA of 20 fungalisolates, only the samples containing the genomic DNA of M. brunnea changed from violet to sky blue (visible to the naked eye) by using hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) dye. No DNA was amplified from the eight other fungus species, including two other Marssonina pathogens, three other foliar fungi pathogens of poplar, and three common foliar fungal endophytes of poplar. Moreover, the detection rates of M. brunnea from artificially and naturally infected poplar leaves were 10/16 (62.5%) and 6/16 (37.5%) using PCR, respectively, while the positive-sample ratios were both 16/16 (100%) using the LAMP assay.

It plays a crucial role in the health of animals and humans, which obtain it only through diet, mainly from animal products. This study aimed to identify endophytic bacterial strains capable of synthesizing vitamin B12 and enriching edible plants with it as a potential solution for vitamin B12 deficiency in vegetarians, vegans, and people with poor diets. An in silico genome analysis was performed on 66 bacterial genomes, including the reference strain Pseudomonas denitrificans ATCC 13867, a known vitamin B12 producer. The genomes were analyzed using the Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST) server and the MetaCyc database to verify the presence and completeness of the vitamin B12 metabolic pathway. The ability of the strains to produce vitamin B12 was confirmed with a high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) analysis of pure culture extracts. Eleven strains produced detectable amounts of vitamin B12 under tested conditions.

13428,From Lamarckian fertilizers to fungal castles: Recapturing the pre-1985 literature on endophytic and saprotrophic fungi associated with ectomycorrhizal root systems,"The endophytic, mantle-inhabiting and rhizosphere-inhabiting microorganisms associated with ectomycorrhizal roots have been studied for over 100 years, but a surprising amount of the information obtained prior to the mid-1980's is difficult to access and understand. In large part, this is because research investigating local ecosystems and silvicultural practices was often considered regional in nature. It tended to be written up in many different languages and to be published in journals that were not widely distributed. After 1985, this scientific isolationism was broken up by the ubiquitous trend towards impact factor measurement and international publishing. The goal of the present review is to make still-relevant information from the pre-1985 ectomycorrhizosphere literature, especially its more strongly obscured elements, readily accessible to modern researchers. Also, some publications that fell into relative obscurity for historical reasons - in particular, studies seeming to reflect the brief association of Soviet mycorrhizal research of the early 1950's with the Lamarckian plant improvement ideas of T. D. Lysenko - are re-examined from current perspectives. The scattered data reveal considerable coherence despite the high ecological diversity they reflect. Endophytes such as members of the Mycelium radicis atrovirens complex - most prominently the species now known as Phialocephala fortinii - feature especially prominently in this area of study, and they received considerable attention beginning in the very early years of the 20th century. They were variously interpreted as potential symbionts or weak pathogens, an ambiguity that continues to the present day for many of these taxa despite the recent molecular clarification of species and population boundaries. The predominance of P. fortinii and other (normally) non-mycorrhizal ""dark (or hyaline) sterile endophyte"" fungi from stringently washed or surface-disinfected ectomycorrhizae in most ecosystems was shown repeatedly beginning with the studies of Elias Melin in the early 1920's. The adjacent rhizosphere soil typically contained sporulating fungi dominated by Penicillium, Umbelopsis and Mortierella species, sometimes accompanied by Trichoderma spp., Cylindrocarpon destructans, and various other microfungi. Microbiological investigations into whether ectomycorrhizae exerted a positive ""rhizosphere effect"" on numbers of fungal propagules in the surrounding soil showed that such effects were often less prominent in natural forests than in planted forests. Several studies showed a general reduction in microbial activity in the zone of ectomycorrhizal influence, and a particularly strong inhibition of soil organisms was shown in the symbiorhizosphere of Tricholoma matsutake and members of the genus Tuber. In relation to such cases, the adoption by mycologists of M. Ogawa's term ""shiro"", (castle, fortress) for the delimited, three-dimensional analogue of a fairy ring formed in soil by many ectomycorrhizal mycobionts is advocated. As relatively highly co-adapted communities, ectomycorrhizosphere organisms appeared to aid in root disease control, in part by harmlessly stimulating roots to produce defensive tannic materials. The production of these materials then appeared to favour the predominance of tannin-degrading Penicillium species in the rhizosphere. Rhizosphere inhabitants were shown to be involved in many types of nutrient and growth factor exchanges, but perhaps to be most important as solubilizers of refractory nutrients like inorganic phosphorus compounds and complex proteinaceous materials. Some potential pathogens like Fusarium spp. tended to be excluded from established forest soils, while Cylindrocarpon destructans, if present, tended to be confined to lower soil regions by microbial acidification of the upper soil zones. The complexity of microfungal communities and their known and potential interactions was high, and seemingly contradictory results often needed to be rationalized, e.g., Trichoderma spp. appeared to be favoured in the root zone in some ecosystems and partially excluded in others, and seemed to abet mycorrhiza formation and tree growth in some habitats but to cause damage to seedlings and mycorrhizal inoculum both in vitro and in the nursery. Modern techniques and bioinformatics methodologies will be needed to make progress towards understanding this complexity, but the multilingual and sometimes overlooked pre-1985 studies provide a very strong initial basis supporting further development.",Summerbell R.C.,Studies in Mycology,2005,10.3114/sim.53.1.191,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.828333491764961,TRUE,2,8,Low,sterile,sterile; ITS; examined; examined; studied,"and population boundaries.

11888,Colonization dynamic and distribution of the endophytic fungus Microdochium bolleyi in plants measured by qPCR,"Microdochium bolleyi is a fungal endophyte of cereals and grasses proposed as an ideal model organism for studying plant-endophyte interactions. A qPCR-based diagnostic assay was developed to detect M. bolleyi in wheat and Brachypodium distachyon tissues using the species-specific primers MbqITS derived from the ITS of the ribosomal gene. Specificity was tested against 20 fungal organisms associated with barley and wheat. Colonization dynamics, endophyte distribution in the plant, and potential of the seed transmission were analyzed in the wheat and model plant B. distachyon. The colonization of plants by endophyte starts from the germinating seed, where the seed coats are first strongly colonized, then the endophyte spreads to the adjacent parts, crown, roots near the crown, and basal parts of the stem. While in the lower distal parts of roots, the concentration of M. bolleyi DNA did not change significantly in successive samplings (30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 days after inoculation), there was a significant increase over time in the roots 1 cm under crown, crowns and stem bases. The endophyte reaches the higher parts of the base (2-4 cm above the crown) 90 days after sowing in wheat and 150 days in B. distachyon. The endophyte does not reach both host species' leaves, peduncles, and ears. Regarding the potential for seed transmission, endophyte was not detected in harvested grains of plants with heavily colonized roots. Plants grown from seeds derived from parental plants heavily colonized by endophyte did not exhibit any presence of the endophyte, so transmission by seeds was not confirmed. The course of colonization dynamics and distribution in the plant was similar for both hosts tested, with two differences: the base of the wheat stem was colonized earlier, but B. distachyon was occupied more intensively and abundantly than wheat.

16916,Nigrospora sphaerica Causing Leaf Spot and Twig and Shoot Blight on Blueberry: A New Host of the Pathogen.,"Blueberries (Vaccinium corymbosum) have recently become an important alternative crop in different ecological regions of Argentina. In surveys, a new disease characterized by leaf spots and twig and shoot blight has been observed on plants cultivated in Arrecifes, Mercedes, and San Pedro (provinces of Buenos Aires) and Concordia (province of Entre Ríos) since July 2004. Spots initially appear brown, circular, 1 to 2 mm in diameter, and irregularly distributed on the leaves and they eventually coalesce. Fruiting twig and shoot blight developed from the tips toward the base. Affected plants of cvs. O'Neal and Reveille were distributed randomly in the field and with a low incidence (average of 2%). The objective of this work was to identify the causal agent of this disease. Symptomatic plant material was surface disinfested with 0.2% NaOCl for 1 min and 70% ethanol for 1 min, washed once with sterile distilled water, blotted dry with paper towels, and plated on potato dextrose agar. Colonies were initially white, becoming light to dark gray with the onset of sporulation with black, sphaerical to subsphaerical conidia that measured 14 to 19 × 12 to 16 μm. These characteristics agree with published descriptions of Nigrospora sphaerica (Sacc.) Mason (1,4). To evaluate pathogenicity, all leaves, petioles, and stems of seven healthy potted plants of cv. O'Neal were punctured with flamed needles and sprayed with a suspension of 1 × 108 spores of the fungus per milliliter of sterile distilled water. Another seven nonwounded plants were sprayed with the spore suspension. Seven plants similarly injured and seven nonwounded plants were sprayed with sterile distilled water and served as controls. Each plant was covered with a water-sprayed polyethylene bag and maintained in a controlled environment chamber at 20°C with a 12-h photoperiod. The bags were removed after 3 days. All wounded inoculated plants began to show disease symptoms similar to those observed in the field 20 days after inoculation. Controls and nonwounded inoculated plants remained symptomless. The pathogen was reisolated from diseased tissues fulfilling Koch's postulates. N. sphaerica is a well-known saprophyte on many plant species but has been mentioned as pathogen on many hosts (2,3). To our knowledge, this is the first reference of N. sphaerica as a wound pathogen of blueberry. In the field, the fungus would have gained access to the plant through wounds caused by insects or frost after a long-term wetness duration. References: (1) M. B. Ellis. Dematiaceous Hyphomycetes.

Benth. from seed by using plant tissue culture, and its successful establishment in the field. This keystone species, although common along parts of the eastern coast of Australia, is currently not available for revegetation because of a lack of efficient propagation methods, leading to the use of substitute species in many restoration programs. Even though seed quality is a common problem for G. radula, one population bearing filled seed was located in the near-east of Melbourne and after harvest of fruit in December 2011, seeds were successfully germinated in vitro after removal of the pericarp. Overnight soaking in sterile 10% (v/v) smoke water before culturing enhanced in vitro germination from 29.2% to 66.7%. In vitro-grown seedlings were then used as starting material for tissue-culture propagation via shoot culture. A micropropagation rate of about six new plantlets per cycle was achieved within 5-6 weeks with liquid half-strength Murashige-Skoog medium and a pulse treatment with 10 mM 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and 2 mM naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). Plants rooted after receiving a pulse treatment with 5 mM kinetin and were successfully acclimatised into potting mix and were ready for field planting after 5-6 months.

12301,Emerging citrus diseases in Europe caused by species of Diaporthe,"Species of Diaporthe are considered important plant pathogens, saprobes, and endophytes on a wide range of plant hosts. Several species are well-known on citrus, either as agents of pre- or post-harvest infections, such as dieback, melanose and stem-end rot on fruit. In this study we explored the occurrence, diversity and pathogenicity of Diaporthe species associated with Citrus and allied genera in European orchards, nurseries, and gardens. Surveys were carried out during 2015 and 2016 in Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, and Spain. A total of 79 Diaporthe strains were isolated from symptomatic twigs, branches and trunks. A multi-locus phylogeny was established based on five genomic loci (ITS, tef1, cal, his3 and tub2), and the morphological characters of the isolates determined. Preliminary pathogenicity tests were performed on lemon, lime, and orange plants with representative isolates. The most commonly isolated species were D. foeniculina and D. baccae, while only four isolates of D. novem were collected. Two new Diaporthe species, described here as D. limonicola and D. melitensis spp. nov. were found associated with a new devastating dieback disease of lemon plants. Furthermore, one cluster of sterile Diaporthe isolates was renamed as D. infertilis. Pathogenicity tests revealed most of the Citrus species as susceptible to D. baccae, D. foeniculina, and D. novem. Moreover, D. limonicola and D. melitensis caused serious cankers affecting all the Citrus species tested. This study is the first report of D. baccae and D. novem on citrus in Europe, and the first detection of a new Diaporthe canker disease of citrus in Europe.

16760,First Report of Alternaria Leaf Spot of Spathiphyllum sp. in Argentina.,"Brown necrotic spots surrounded by chlorotic areas have been observed on the leaf margins of Spathiphyllum sp. in many nurseries in and near Buenos Aires, Argentina, since 1997. Spots reached 0.7 × 2 cm and appeared mainly on older leaves of stressed plants. To determine the causal agent of the leaf spot, small pieces of diseased tissue were surface-sterilized for 2 min in 2% sodium hypochlorite and plated on potato dextrose agar. Gray olivaceous to almost black colonies developed in 3 to 4 days. Dark conidiophores, which formed singly or in small groups, were short, less than 100 μm, sometimes flexuous, and occasionally geniculate. The brown to black, obclavate, pyriform, or rostrate conidia were 20 to 25 μm long × 10 to 15 μm wide, with three to four transverse septa and one to three longitudinal or oblique septa. Chains of conidia 5 to 10 spores long were sometimes branched, appearing bushy. The foliage of 15 healthy potted plants previously injured with sterile needles and 15 healthy potted plants without injuries was inoculated with a suspension of 2.8 × 104 conidia per ml. Plants were maintained at 23°C and 100% relative humidity under fluorescent light (12 h light/12 h darkness) for 3 days.

Methodology: Termites (O. obesus) were collected from infested wood and acclimatized at 26 ± 2°C and 75 ± 5% RH. Active, uninjured workers were used for bioassays. M. anisopliae and B. bassiana cultures from ICAR-NBAIR were grown on SDA and PDA media, respectively, at 25 ± 1°C. Conidia (1 × 108 conidia ml-1) were suspended in sterile water with 0.05% Triton X-100. Termites were treated using a Potter spray tower, with controls receiving sterile water. Mortality was observed over seven days, and LT50 values were calculated. D. sissoo seedlings were inoculated with fungal suspensions via soil drench and foliar spray. Colonization was assessed by re-isolating fungi from surface-sterilized plant tissues. Results: M. anisopliae showed greater virulence against O. obesus, with a lower LT50 (32.84 hr) compared to B. bassiana (42.48 hr) and a steeper dose-response slope (4.88). Colonization studies revealed the M. anisopliae achieved higher rates in foliage (84.31%), roots (76.36%), and leaves (80.94%) compared to B. bassiana (74.32%, 60.52%, 69.98%, respectively), with significant differences noted in root and leaf colonization (P < 0.001).

A total of 673 trees showing different degree of decline were sampled in four forests of the western Alps. Fungal endophytes were isolated from woody microcores and identified oil the basis of their macroscopic and microscopic features. Molecular methods were used to identify sterile Basidiomycota and Heterobasidion isolates. A total of 143 fungal taxa were identified. Ascomycota and anamorphic fungi were dominant, followed by Basidiomycota and Zygomycota. Different fungal communities were identified in the sequence ""healthy - intermediate declining declining trees"". Declining trees were found to harbour a higher number of taxa and are characterized by higher colonization frequencies than healthy-looking trees. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) indicates that fungal assemblages are significantly affected by the degree of decline of trees and to a lesser extent by their diameter and by presence of mistletoes. Our observations suggest that endophytic fungi inhabiting sapwood could play a secondary role in the decline processes of forest trees.","Giordano, L; Gonthier, P; Varese, GC; Miserere, L; Nicolotti, G",FUNGAL DIVERSITY,2009,NA,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.822601323715926,TRUE,2,8,Low,sterile,isolated; sterile; examined; examined; sampled,oil the basis of their macroscopic and microscopic features.

16945,First Report of Southern Blight Caused by Sclerotium rolfsii on Hemp (Cannabis sativa) in Sicily and Southern Italy.,"Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.), family Cannabaceae, is an annual herbaceous plant that is 1.5 to 4.0 m tall and native to the Caucasus Region, northern India, and Iran. It is cultivated in warm to temperate regions worldwide for its fiber, oil, and psychoactive substances. In Europe, commercial plantings have decreased from 52,872 ha in 1989 to 18,716 ha in 2005. Recently however, cultivation of hemp as a natural fiber species has been encouraged by European Union policy (2). During the summer of 2003, patches of dead plants were observed in test plots of 12 monoecious and dioecious hemp cultivars (Beniko, Epsylon 68, Felina 34, Ferimon, Fedora 17, Futura 75, Bialobrzeskie, Dioica 88, Fibranova, Tiborszallasi, Lovrin, and Carmagnola) in an experimental field near Catania (eastern Sicily) previously planted to artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.). Plots were irrigated with a drip irrigation system. Symptoms were first detected in July with day/night temperatures between 35 and 26°C. Infected plants showed a dark brown-to-tan discoloration of the stem near the soil line. As disease progressed, the rot extended down to the crown and taproot, foliage became yellow, and the entire plant eventually collapsed. An extensive white, cottony mycelium and numerous spherical tan-to-dark brown sclerotia (0.5 to 4.0 mm in diameter) developed externally on infected tissues and soil. As much as 60% of the plants were affected in a single plot. Monoecious cultivars that had been planted earlier escaped the disease. Isolations from diseased tissues were performed by plating symptomatic tissues previously disinfected for 1 min in 1% NaOCl and rinsed in sterile water on acidified potato dextrose agar (pH 4.5). Isolations consistently yielded a fungus whose characters corresponded to Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc. (teleomorph Athelia rolfsii (Curzi) Tu & Kimbrough). Pathogenicity of two isolates obtained from infected plants was confirmed by inoculating 120-day-old hemp plants grown in individual pots. Twenty plants for each of the above listed cultivars (10 plants for each isolate) were inoculated by applying toothpick tips (5 mm) colonized by S. rolfsii to the lower part of the stem. Ten noninoculated plants served as controls. Plants were kept in a greenhouse with temperatures between 26 and 32°C and 95% relative humidity. High soil moisture was maintained with frequent watering. All inoculated plants showed blight and basal stem rot after 2 weeks, irrespective of the cultivar. By the third week, plants began to dry up and mycelium and sclerotia developed on the crown. Noninoculated controls remained symptomless. S. rolfsii was reisolated from inoculated plants. Although S. rolfsii has been reported on hemp in India since the 1930s (3), to our knowledge, this is the first report of southern blight caused by this fungus on C. sativa in Sicily and southern Italy. Residues of artichoke, a very susceptible host of S. rolfsii (1), might have been the source of inoculum for this outbreak on hemp. Most likely, high summer temperatures and overirrigation exacerbated the disease severity. References: (1) C. Cariddi and R. Lops. La Difesa delle Piante 19(1):27, 1996. (2) S. L. Cosentino et al.

5319,Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin as an endophyte in tissue culture banana (Musa spp.),"Beauveria bassiana is considered a virulent pathogen against the banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus. However, current field application techniques for effective control against this pest remain a limitation and an alternative method for effective field application needs to be investigated. Three screenhouse experiments were conducted to determine the ability of B. bassiana to form an endophytic relationship with tissue culture banana (Musa spp.) plants and to evaluate the plants for possible harmful effects resulting from this relationship. Three Ugandan strains of B. bassiana (G41, S204 and WA) were applied by dipping the roots and rhizome in a conidial suspension, by injecting a conidial suspension into the plant rhizome and by growing the plants in sterile soil mixed with B. bassiana-colonized rice substrate. Four weeks after inoculation, plant growth parameters were determined and plant tissue colonization assessed through re-isolation of B. bassiana. All B. bassiana strains were able to colonize banana plant roots, rhizomes and pseudostem bases. Dipping plants in a conidial suspension achieved the highest colonization with no negative effect on plant growth or survival. Beauveria bassiana strain G41 was the best colonizer (up to 68%, 79% and 41% in roots, rhizome and pseudostem base, respectively) when plants were dipped. This study demonstrated that, depending on strain and inoculation method, R bassiana can form an endophytic relationship with tissue culture banana plants, causing no harmful effects and might provide an alternative method for biological control of C sordidus.

16647,First Report of Gray Leaf Spot Caused by Alternaria brassicae on Canola in Argentina.,"Canola (Brassica napus) is a developing oleaginous crop grown commercially in Argentina. During 2003, typical symptoms of a foliar disease were observed on canola plants in experimental field plots in Buenos Aires. Average disease incidence across 14 6-month-old canola cultivars was 27% (range 12 to 42%). Climatic conditions in Buenos Aires during August 2003 included moderate temperatures and periods with high humidity, which were apparently favorable for disease development. Symptoms were observed on leaves, stems, and pods. Leaf symptoms were randomly distributed on the adaxial surfaces and consisted of zonate lesions of alternating light gray and dark brown areas that were 6 to 10 mm in diameter. Remaining leaf tissue was chlorotic and affected leaves abscised. Stem infections appeared as irregular and elongated black lesions, 0.7 to 1.2 cm long. Pods lesions were circular, 6 to 8 mm in diameter, gray in the center, and surrounded by a diffuse dark brown margin. The disease developed progressively from the lower leaves to the pods, resulting in premature senescence of the tissues, chlorosis, and defoliation. Conidiophores bearing conidia colonized the lesions as a dark gray growth of spore masses. Segments (0.5 cm long) taken from leaves, stems, and pods of diseased plants were dipped in 70% ethanol, surface sterilized with NaOCl (1%) for 2 min, and rinsed in sterile water. Each segment was blotted dry and placed on potato dextrose agar. Plates were incubated in the dark at 25°C for 2 to 3 days, followed by incubation under NUV light and a 12-h light/dark photoperiod for 6 to 8 days. Six fungal isolates were obtained. Fungal colonies were pale gray with dark concentric rings. Conidia were yellow to pale brown, ellipsoid to ovoid, produced singly or in short chains, with 8 to 10 transverse septa and 2 to 6 longitudinal septa. The spore body measured 13 to 22 × 68 to 135 µm with a beak cell 42 to 101 µm long. On the basis of conidial and cultural characteristics, the fungus was identified as Alternaria brassicae (Berk.) Sacc (1). Koch's postulates were completed for three isolates by spray-inoculating foliage of 6-week-old canola plants of cvs. Caviar, Dunkeld, Eclipse, Impulse, Mistral, and Sponsor with a conidial suspension (1 × 105 conidia per ml). The experiment, which included four inoculated plants and two noninoculated control plants for each cultivar per isolate, was conducted in the greenhouse at 22 to 24°C and maintained at 75% relative humidity with no supplemental light. Inoculated and control plants were covered with polyethylene bags for 48 h after inoculation. Within 12 days, inoculated plants developed small, brown lesions on leaves and stems for all three isolates; the pathogen was successfully reisolated in all instances. Control plants, inoculated only with sterile distilled water, remained symptomless. The experiment was repeated with similar results. The results suggest that A. brassicae may be a threat to the main cultivars being grown in Argentina. To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. brassicae causing gray leaf spot of canola in Argentina. Reference: (1) J. Joly. Le genre Alternaria.

14642,Biological control of the latent pathogen Gnomoniopsis smithogylvyi in European chestnut grafting scions using Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Trichoderma atroviride,"A search for endophytes in Castanea sativa Miller (Fagales: Fagaceae) grafting scions showed that a latent pathogenic fungus Gnomoniopsis smithogilvyi (Diaporthales: Gnomoniaceae) was present as the major component of the endophytic flora. Initially, the goal of this study was to develop a biological control method of Cryphonectria parasitica (Diaporthales: Valsaceae), the chestnut blight agent, by soaking chestnut scions before grafting in antagonists suspension. However, the healthy chestnut material used in in vitro and glasshouse experiments turned out to be naturally infected by a pathogen. At first view, the symptoms looked very similar to those caused by C. parasitica but some differences were noticed. DNA sequencing and application of Koch’s postulates revealed that G. smithogilvyi was the agent responsible of those symptoms. Preventive biocontrol experiments were carried out with chestnut tree scions soaked overnight in a liquid suspension of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (Bacillales: Bacillaceae). This bacterium was then frequently found in the lower parts of scions (CF of 100% between 3.1 and 6 cm) and up to a height of 18 cm. It was observed that when B. amyloliquefaciens was present, the endophytic and opportunistic pathogenic fungus G. smithogilvyi was not present. Conversely, the parts not colonized by the bacteria were always naturally infected by the endophytic fungus. This would indicate that the endophytic behavior of B. amyloliquefaciens inhibited the growth of G. smithogilvyi and reduced its presence in scions. A similar experiment, carried out with the Trichoderma atroviride (Hypocreales: Hypocreaceae), led to similar observations. Trichoderma atroviride was frequently isolated in the lower parts of scions (CF of 100% until 6 cm) and up to a height of 27 cm. Inoculating B. amyloliquefaciens and T. atroviride as part of a preventive biocontrol treatment would allow these biological control agents to colonize the plant as endophytes and prevent the development of G. smithogilvyi. © 2016, Polska Akademia Nauk.

These fungi possess a fruity smell, lack reproductive structures, form pale yellow colored colonies with radial crevices on potato dextrose agar. Muscodor ghoomensis has a sterile ropy mycelium with clustered structures resembling grapes while M. indica formed sterile submerged mycelium that formed coils. Phylogenetic analysis based on ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 regions indicated significant differences from previously reported Muscodor species indicating their novelty. The characteristic smell of M. ghoomensis and M. indica is attributed to a blend of 16 and 21 volatile organic compounds produced by the fungi. The predominant volatiles produced by these fungi are 4-octadecylmorpho-line; 1, 6-dioxacyclododecane-7, 12-dione, 1,4-dimethyl-7-prop-1-en-2-y1-2,3,3a,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydro-1H-azulen-4-ol and squalene identified using GC/MS. Based on their unique morphological, molecular and volatile chemoprofiles, M. ghoomensis and M. indica are new additions to the genus Muscodor.

Of the total number of isolates from the leaves from the Swiss, British and Spanish sites 87%, 31% and 63%, respectively, were coelomycetes. Four species of Phomopsis, which includes Phyllosticta ilicina (= Phomopsis ilicina v. d. Aa, ined.), were the most frequent endophytes of leaves and were either absent or rare in the twig units. Two distinct kinds of sterile mycelia were common in twigs. Swiss and Spanish trees possessed fungal assemblages distinct from those present in Britain. Naturalized stands were distinguished from native stands by the presence of rather cosmopolitan and non-specific fungal taxa, rare or absent in the samples collected in the native stands. Samples derived from the native stands were colonized by more host-specific fungi. The relative frequency of two sterile mycelia in the Swiss and Spanish sites determined their separation. Phyllosticta (Phomopsis) ilicina, the most numerous leaf colonizer, was virtually absent from the bark and the xylem.

Establishing an in vitro culture was very difficult due to constant contaminations, tissue browning and stunted shoot growth. A sterile shoot culture was finally achieved by washing with running tap water, immersing in a mixture of ascorbic and citric acid and sterilizing with 70% ethanol and dichloroisocyanuric acid. Shoot growth was optimal on DKW medium supplemented with 4 mg/L of 2iP. Even in optimized conditions, sporadic fungal outbursts occurred. Fungi were isolated and their taxonomic origin was determined by morphological observation and molecular identification. Based on BLAST queries in the NCBI database, five genera of fungi were identified: Cladosporium, Chaetomium, Preussia, Biscogniauxia and Sistotrema, the last three genera being isolated from olives for the first time. A detailed literature search was performed to provide data on previous reports of these genera in relation to their putative endophytic presence and their possible pathogenic status. This is the first study reporting the presence of endophytic fungi in olive tissue culture. The information provided in this work can be very useful for the optimization of micropropagation protocols of recalcitrant olive cultivars and can potentially improve field performance of nursery plants.","Orazem, P; Celar, FA; Bohanec, B",ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,2016,10.2298/ABS150415140O,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.900121818920127,TRUE,2,8,Low,sterile,isolated; culture; medium; sterile,"culture was very difficult due to constant contaminations, tissue browning and stunted shoot growth.

8981,"Development of methods for detection and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of the sterile, endophytic fungus Muscodor albus","Symbiotic endophytes, unlike plant pathogens, do not usually induce visible host response. This may constraint the researcher's decision whether a plant has been successfully infected by the endophyte. In order to properly study the establishment, development and progress of an endophyte in the host plant and host-endophyte interactions, methods for the identification and localization of endophytic microorganisms are needed. Towards this aim, we focused at two levels: (A) We constructed M. albus-specific primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In vitro, these primers specifically detected only M. albus strains and not isolates of related fungi (such as Daldinia sp. and a Xylariaceae sp.). (B) For direct visualization of the fungi, we inserted a reporter gene (gfp) into M. albus hyphae using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Since M. albus is a sterile fungus (i.e., without spores or fungal fruiting bodies), we used chopped fungal mycelium for the transformation procedure. We transformed three different isolates of M. albus using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Fifty-nine different transformants were collected with a transformation efficacy of 0.0004-0.0026%. Although PCR-based detection and direct visualization of the transformants in planta were unsuccessful, all tested transformants (with one exception) exhibited similar biological activity to their cognate wild type.

3809,Filamentous fungi from Plantago lanceolata L. leaves: Contribution to the pattern and stability of bioactive metabolites,"The aim of this study was to test contribution of plant-associated microorganism (PAMs) to metabolite stability/instability in a medicinal plant matrix. Therefore, PAM strains were isolated and identified based on relevant DNA sequences from Plantago lanceolata leaves. Sterile water extracts of P. lanceolata were incubated with the isolated strains and antioxidants (ascorbic acid (AA), and EDTA) for 15 days, and changes in the concentrations of chief bioactive constituents (aucubin, catalpol, acteoside (=verbascoside)) were quantified by capillary electrophoresis. Phenolic breakdown-products were identified by GC-MS. PAMs were identified from the genera Epicoccum, Bipolaris, Cladosporium, Leptosphaerulina, Aspergillus, Eurotium and Penicillium (pathongens, endophytes, and other species). Some fungi caused significant decomposition of the chief constituents (p < 0.001). Surprisingly, some strains inhibited breakdown of acteoside (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, concentration of several phenolic acids increased in fungi-infested extracts (p < 0.001). Gentisic acid, 4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and hydroxytyrosol were only present when the extract was infested with a PAM. The products are powerful antioxidants and chelators. Concentrations of phenolic acids influenced acteoside stability significantly (p < 0.01), as shown by basic data-mining techniques. AA and EDTA also significantly inhibited acteoside breakdown in sterile model solutions (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that the phenolic acid mixture (produced during the fungal proliferation) protected acteoside from breakdown, possibly via its antioxidant activity and metal complexing ability. It was shown that PAMs can increase or decrease the stability of chief metabolites in herbal matrices, and can significantly alter the chemical pattern of the plant matrix. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This study aimed to assess fungal contamination in two plants handling solid waste management. Air samples from the two plants were collected through an impaction method. Surface samples were also collected by swabbing surfaces of the same indoor sites. All collected samples were incubated at 27 degrees C for 5 to 7 d. After lab processing and incubation of collected samples, quantitative and qualitative results were obtained with identification of the isolated fungal species. Air samples were also subjected to molecular methods by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) using an impinger method to measure DNA of Aspergillus flavus complex and Stachybotrys chartarum. Assessment of particulate matter (PM) was also conducted with portable direct-reading equipment. Particles concentration measurement was performed at five different sizes (PM0.5; PM1; PM2.5; PM5; PM10). With respect to the waste sorting plant, three species more frequently isolated in air and surfaces were A. niger (73.9%; 66.1%), A. fumigatus (16%; 13.8%), and A. flavus (8.7%; 14.2%).

8957,The promoting role of an isolate of dark-septate fungus on its host plant Saussurea involucrata Kar. et Kir.,"A dark-septate endophytic (DSE) fungus EF-37 was isolated from the roots of Saussurea involucrata Kar. et Kir., an endangered Chinese medicinal plant. The molecular identification of the fungus was based on internal transcribed spacer regions and the result showed that EF-37 was congeneric to Mycocentrospora. This study was conducted to clarify the influence of the root endophyte EF-37 on the host plant S. involucrata using material grown in a sterile culture bottle. After cultivation for 40 days, fungal hyphae were found to be branching repeatedly and forming ""hyphae nets"" in the epidermal layers. Significant differences were detected between the study groups in plant dry weight, plant height, root dry weight, shoot dry weight, and the number of hair root tips. There was a positive effect of endophyte EF-37 on plant root development, with results showing that cortical cells dissolved and formed aerate structures. There was a positive effect of endophyte EF-37 on plant growth, but chlorophyll fluorescence analysis showed that there were no significant differences between the study groups. In addition, analysis of the chemical composition of seedlings showed that the level of rutin was higher in plants cultivated with the EF-37 fungus compared to the controls.

In this study, the fungal community associated with the ectomycorrhizae of Castanopsis cuspidata was investigated using a culture-dependent isolation technique. Additionally, the species composition and localization were determined using molecular techniques. The results of the isolation and identification of fungal species revealed the predominance of a few species belonging to the order Helotiales.

The endophytic assemblages were studied as a function of health status of the whole tree and of twigs and leaves. The effect of station altitude was tested on Q. cerris . Samples were gathered from healthy and declining trees. In April (bud opening time) 20 twigs and 10 leaves were collected from each tree. Fungi were isolated from twig segments and leaf portions. A total of 23 fungal genera with 27 different species were isolated, in addition to a few sterile mycelia. Eleven species were found to be common to all three oak species, while other species were found only on one oak species, suggesting host specificity. Among the fungal species isolated, some were known to be pathogenic (Apiognomonia quercina, Colpoma quercinum, Diplodia mutila, Phomopsis quercina ). The colonization frequency (CF) of pathogenic species varied between 0.9% for A. quercina in Q. cerris and 60.2% for P. quercina in Q. robur . Analysis of variance showed a statistically significant difference among the oak species tested. The CF was higher in declining trees in comparison with healthy trees, and also in twigs vs. leaves. The CF was found to be higher for Q. cerris trees growing at sea level as compared with those situated at an elevation of 350-400 m.

17332,Culture dependent and independent analysis of bacterial communities associated with commercial salad leaf vegetables.,"Plants harbor a diverse bacterial community, both as epiphytes on the plant surface and as endophytes within plant tissue. While some plant-associated bacteria act as plant pathogens or promote plant growth, others may be human pathogens. The aim of the current study was to determine the bacterial community composition of organic and conventionally grown leafy salad vegetables at the point of consumption using both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods. Total culturable bacteria on salad vegetables ranged from 8.0 × 10(3) to 5.5 × 10(8) CFU g(-1). The number of culturable endophytic bacteria from surface sterilized plants was significantly lower, ranging from 2.2 × 10(3) to 5.8 × 10(5) CFU g(-1). Cultured isolates belonged to six major bacterial phyla, and included representatives of Pseudomonas, Pantoea, Chryseobacterium, and Flavobacterium. Eleven different phyla and subphyla were identified by culture-independent pyrosequencing, with Gammaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes being the most dominant lineages. Other bacterial lineages identified (e.g. Firmicutes, Alphaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria) typically represented less than 1% of sequences obtained. At the genus level, sequences classified as Pseudomonas were identified in all samples and this was often the most prevalent genus. Ralstonia sequences made up a greater portion of the community in surface sterilized than non-surface sterilized samples, indicating that it was largely endophytic, while Acinetobacter sequences appeared to be primarily associated with the leaf surface. Analysis of molecular variance indicated there were no significant differences in bacterial community composition between organic versus conventionally grown, or surface-sterilized versus non-sterilized leaf vegetables. While culture-independent pyrosequencing identified significantly more bacterial taxa, the dominant taxa from pyrosequence data were also detected by traditional culture-dependent methods. The use of pyrosequencing allowed for the identification of low abundance bacteria in leaf salad vegetables not detected by culture-dependent methods.

Three experiments were performed in parallel: (i) isolation, identification and molecular characterization of fungi from surface-sterilized roots of both plant species; (ii) re-inoculation of fungal isolates on axenic E. arborea and Q. ilex seedlings; (iii) direct inoculation of field-collected Q. ilex ectomycorrhizas onto E. arborea seedlings. About 70 and 150 fungal isolates were obtained from roots of Q. ilex and E. arborea, respectively. Among them, Oidiodendron species and five cultural morphotypes of sterile isolates formed typical ericoid mycorrhizas on E. arborea in vitro. Fungi with such mycorrhizal ability were derived from both host plants. Isolates belonging to one of these morphotypes (sd9) also exhibited an unusual pattern of colonization, with an additional extracellular hyphal net.

10122,Foliar Fungal Endophyte Communities of Scottish Plantation Pines,"The diversity of foliar fungal endophyte communities was examined in three economically and ecologically important pine species in Scotland: Scots pine, Corsican pine and lodgepole pine. Two plantation sites comprising all three species were selected in climatically contrasting parts of Scotland and were sampled in late spring by collecting healthy needles from two age classes. Surface sterilisation was carried out before obtaining cultures of fungal isolates, and representatives of common sterile morphotypes were sequenced to determine taxonomic placement. Overall relative proportions of the dominant taxa across sites, tree species and needle age classes were as follows: Anthostomella spp. (52%), Lophodermium seditiosum (17%) and Desmazierella acicola (7%). Many other less frequent taxa were recovered. The results agreed with previous endophyte studies in that the combined effects of site and tree species produced unique endophytic fungal assemblages. Phylogenetic analyses revealed potential sub-species variation associated with site in Anthostomella pinea. Our findings point to the potential naturalisation of European fungal endophytic species (e.g., Anthostomella spp.) in Scottish pine plantations, particularly in association with Corsican pine.","Jones, AL; Taylor, JE; Ennos, RA",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2025,10.3390/jof11020148,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.8696053577119,TRUE,2,8,Low,sterile,sterile; sequenced; examined; examined; sampled,"Surface sterilisation was carried out before obtaining cultures of fungal isolates, and representatives of common sterile morphotypes were sequenced to determine taxonomic placement.

10768,Culturable Fungi of Stored 'Golden Delicious' Apple Fruits: A One-Season Comparison Study of Organic and Integrated Production Systems in Switzerland,"The effects of organic and integrated production systems on the culturable fungal microflora of stored apple fruits from five matched pairs of certified organic and integrated 'Golden Delicious' farms were studied at five representative production sites in Switzerland. Isolated fungi were identified morphologically. Colonization frequency (percentage of apples colonized), abundance (colony numbers), and diversity (taxon richness) were assessed for each orchard. The standard quality of the stored fruits was comparable for both organic and integrated apples and complied with national food hygiene standards. Yeasts (six taxa) and the yeast-like fungus Aureobasidium pullulans were the dominant epiphytes, filamentous fungi (21 taxa) the dominant endophytes. The most common fungi occurred at all sites and belonged to the ""white"" and ""pink"" yeasts, yeast-like A. pullulans, filamentous fungi Cladosporium spp., Alternaria spp., and sterile filamentous fungi. Canonical correspondence analysis of the total fungal community revealed a clear differentiation among production systems and sites. Compared to integrated apples, organic apples had significantly higher frequencies of filamentous fungi, abundance of total fungi, and taxon diversity. The effects of the production system on the fungal microflora are most likely due to the different plant protection strategies. The incidence of potential mycotoxin producers such as Penicillium and Alternaria species was not different between production systems. We suggest that higher fungal diversity may generally be associated with organic production and may increase the level of beneficial and antagonistically acting species known for their potential to suppress apple pathogens, which may be an advantage to organic apples, e.g., in respect to natural disease control.","Granado, J; Thürig, B; Kieffer, E; Petrini, L; Fliessbach, A; Tamm, L; Weibel, FP; Wyss, GS",MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,2008,10.1007/s00248-008-9391-x,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.621125722449091,TRUE,2,8,Low,sterile,isolated; colony; sterile; studied; assessed,"the ""white"" and ""pink"" yeasts, yeast-like A. pullulans, filamentous fungi Cladosporium spp., Alternaria spp., and sterile filamentous fungi.

10570,Species-Specific Detection of Mycosphaerella polygoni-cuspidati as a Biological Control Agent for Fallopia japonica by PCR Assay,"The ascomycete fungus Mycosphaerella polygoni-cuspidati has been undergoing evaluation as a potential classical biological control agent for the invasive weed Fallopia japonica (Japanese knotweed), which has become troublesome in Europe and North America. In advance of the potential release of a biocontrol agent into a new environment, it is crucial to develop an effective monitoring system to enable the evaluation of agent establishment and dispersal within the target host population, as well as any potential attacks on non-target species. Therefore, a primer pair was designed for direct, rapid, and specific detection of the Japanese knotweed pathogen M. polygoni-cuspidati based on the sequences of the internal transcribed spacer regions including the 5.8S rDNA. A PCR product of approximately 298 bp was obtained only when the DNA extracted from mycelial fragments of M. polygoni-cuspidati was used. The lower limit of detection of the PCR method was 100 fg of genomic DNA. Using the specific primer pair, M. polygoni-cuspidati could be detected from both naturally and artificially infected Japanese knotweed plants.

EBS9 from Tecomella undulata and its biocontrol applications.,"This study investigates the quorum quenching (QQ) activity of an endophytic bacterium, Bacillus sp. EBS9, isolated from the native medicinal plant Tecomella undulata of Rajasthan, and its biocontrol potential against the soft rot pathogen Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (Pcc). QQ activity was confirmed by the loss of violacein pigment in Chromobacterium violaceum (MCC 2290). Quorum quenching metabolites were extracted using ethyl acetate, and the Quorum Quenching Extract (QQE) demonstrated positive activity in assays with C. violaceum CV026 (MCC 2216). HRLC-MS analysis identified diketopiperazines, L,L-Cyclo (leucylprolyl) and Cyclo (L-Phe-L-Pro), which are N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) antagonists competing for LuxR receptor binding sites. In vitro and in planta assays evaluated QQB's biocontrol potential using treatment I (Pcc), treatment II (Pcc + QQB), and a control (sterile water). In the in vitro soft rot attenuation assay showed that treatment I caused severe maceration in vegetable slices, particularly in radish, exhibiting the highest maceration diameter (25.33 ± 3.52 mm) and percentage (46.14 ± 5.70 %). However, co-inoculation with QQB significantly reduced maceration across all tested vegetables. In the plate assay, germination rates decreased to approximately 50 % in both Vigna radiata and Raphanus sativus for treatment I, but improved to 86.67 % in treatment II. The seed vigour and germination indices also improved with QQB treatment in both plant species. In the pot assay after 30 days, in contrast to a 50 % decrease in root and shoot lengths in treatment I, treatment II led to a substantial recovery, with root lengths increase by 112.07 % and 138.76 %, while shoot length by 315.65 % and 163.63 % in V. radiata and R. sativus, respectively.

3375,Encapsulation of Metarhizium brunneum enhances endophytism in tomato plants,"Biocontrol of insect pests using fungal entomopathogens has been promoted as a promising alternative to chemical pesticides. Apart from their direct mode of action against insect pests, several fungal entomopathogens have been reported as natural endophytes, paving the way for novel plant protection measures. In this study, we aimed at the selective propagation of finely dispersed Metarhizium brunneum strain BIPESCO5 mycelium in submerged culture and encapsulation in calcium alginate/starch beads to protect the fungus during drying, enable growth on different soils and promote endophytism in tomato plants. We found that a combination of osmotic pressure and increased medium viscosity promoted selective formation of finely dispersed mycelium reflected by 34.1-fold decreased pellet diameters, 1.8-fold increased mycelial biomass concentrations and low blastospore contents of 40.4 x 10(5) mL(-1) after 48 h. Encapsulation of mycelium enhanced drying survival by 31.5%. Co-encapsulated starch was degraded by 24.8% after 21 days and served as a nutrient source for growth on soils with best results on sterile and non-sterile potting substrate with 8.7 mm and 4.4 mm radial mycelial growth, respectively, compared to water agar with 7.6 mm. When applied to the soil, encapsulation significantly increased endophytism 3.8-7.0-fold compared to plants treated with non-formulated fungal biomass.

Endophytic infection was observed on sterile leaf discs and living 2-month-old seedlings of Q. alba and Q. rubra. Fungal-host reciprocal inoculations revealed the presence of conidiomata on both hosts but conidiomata production was more abundant on Q. alba. Isolates from Q. rubra produced milder disease symptoms on both oak species. Mycelial compatibility studies identified seven different MCG groups. MCG groups 1 - 3 contained isolates from both oak species whereas MCG groups 4 - 7 contained host specific isolates. Field studies monitored the seasonal appearance of the sexual fruiting structures, perithecia, as a possible source of new genetic variation that might alter host specificity/pathogenicity of the D. umbrinella isolates on Q. alba and Q. rubra hosts. Only 1 - 2% of the leaves contained perithecia throughout the sampling period ( April - September). Isolates collected from Q. alba differed from those collected from Q. rubra in endophytic infection, pathogenic response, and perithecia production. The results of this study suggest that the endophyte - host relationship is one of host selective preference for Q. alba, but that the endophyte has the ability to maintain the endophytic/pathogenic life cycle on the less preferred host species, Q. rubra.","Cohen, SD",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY,2004,10.1023/B:EJPP.0000041564.63509.2f,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.979923206723496,TRUE,2,8,Low,sterile,cultured; sterile; observed; collected; monitored,"located in Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Laurel, Maryland, USA.

170,PARAQUAT - A TOOL FOR THE QUICK DEVELOPMENT OF LATENT FUNGAL-INFECTIONS AND ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI,"Detached winter wheat leaves without any symptom of fungal infection were thoroughly washed, surface desinfected, treated with paraquat (0.03-0.32% a.i.) and incubated on nutrient agar or in moist chambers under sterile conditions. Microscopic examinations showed that hyphae and yeast cells emerged from several stomata within 48-72 h after treatment. Fungal colonies developed on agar within the same period of time. More than 27 filamentous fungal genera and yeasts were identified during a wheat crop in healthy, green leaves. Non-treated leaves showed very few early emergences of fungi from stomata, but senescent leaves eventually yielded several fungal taxa observed after paraquat treatment. Similar observations were made on non-detached wheat leaves, and on detached sugarbeet leaves. Paraquat also induced development of Fusarium spp. from detached healthy winter wheat ears before or after heading. In grape berries, paraquat induced the development of latent infections of Botrytis cinerea a few days after treatment. The usefulness of paraquat for the detection of endophytes and for the diagnosis of early and latent fungal infections in plants, and the possible involvement of endophytes in tissue senescence are discussed.","GINDRAT, D; PEZET, R",JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY-PHYTOPATHOLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT,1994,10.1111/j.1439-0434.1994.tb01448.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.956148794791586,TRUE,2,8,Low,sterile,incubated; agar; sterile; observed,treated with paraquat (0.03-0.32% a.i.) and incubated on nutrient agar or in moist chambers under sterile conditions.

5037,Pitting the olive seed microbiome,"BackgroundThe complex and co-evolved interplay between plants and their microbiota is crucial for the health and fitness of the plant holobiont. However, the microbiota of the seeds is still relatively unexplored and no studies have been conducted with olive trees so far. In this study, we aimed to characterize the bacterial, fungal and archaeal communities present in seeds of ten olive genotypes growing in the same orchard through amplicon sequencing to test whether the olive genotype is a major driver in shaping the seed microbial community, and to identify the origin of the latter. Therefore, we have developed a methodology for obtaining samples from the olive seed's endosphere under sterile conditions.ResultsA diverse microbiota was uncovered in olive seeds, the plant genotype being an important factor influencing the structure and composition of the microbial communities. The most abundant bacterial phylum was Actinobacteria, accounting for an average relative abundance of 41%. At genus level, Streptomyces stood out because of its potential influence on community structure. Within the fungal community, Basidiomycota and Ascomycota were the most abundant phyla, including the genera Malassezia, Cladosporium, and Mycosphaerella. The shared microbiome was composed of four bacterial (Stenotrophomonas, Streptomyces, Promicromonospora and Acidipropionibacterium) and three fungal (Malassezia, Cladosporium and Mycosphaerella) genera. Furthermore, a comparison between findings obtained here and earlier results from the root endosphere of the same trees indicated that genera such as Streptomyces and Malassezia were present in both olive compartments.ConclusionsThis study provides the first insights into the composition of the olive seed microbiota. The highly abundant fungal genus Malassezia and the bacterial genus Streptomyces reflect a unique signature of the olive seed microbiota. The genotype clearly shaped the composition of the seed's microbial community, although a shared microbiome was found. We identified genera that may translocate from the roots to the seeds, as they were present in both organs of the same trees. These findings set the stage for future research into potential vertical transmission of olive endophytes and the role of specific microbial taxa in seed germination, development, and seedling survival.","Wentzien, NM; Fernández-González, AJ; Valverde-Corredor, A; Lasa, AV; Villadas, PJ; Wicaksono, WA; Cernava, T; Berg, G; Fernández-López, M; Mercado-Blanco, J",ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOME,2024,10.1186/s40793-024-00560-x,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.567765658896882,TRUE,2,8,Low,sterile,sterile; amplicon; sequencing; ITS,"Therefore, we have developed a methodology for obtaining samples from the olive seed's endosphere under sterile conditions.ResultsA diverse microbiota was uncovered in olive seeds, the plant genotype being an important factor","Therefore, we have developed a methodology for obtaining samples from the olive seed's endosphere under sterile conditions.ResultsA diverse microbiota was uncovered in olive seeds, the plant genotype being an important factor | archaeal communities present in seeds of ten olive genotypes growing in the same orchard through amplicon sequencing to test whether the olive genotype is a major driver in shaping the seed | communities present in seeds of ten olive genotypes growing in the same orchard through amplicon sequencing to test whether the olive genotype is a major driver in shaping the seed microbial | for an average relative abundance of 41%.

875,Non-native grass alters growth of native tree species via leaf and soil microbes,"1. Non-native plants can alter both native microbe communities and ecosystem processes. These changes may indirectly affect native plant communities. We tested whether an invasive plant influences other plant species through above- and below-ground microbial associations. These factors have received less attention than direct competition for resources in research on plant invasions. 2. Previous work in the mid-western US revealed that the above-ground fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum) in non-native tall fescue grass (Lolium arundinaceum) reduced establishment of native tree species, slowing plant succession from grassland to forest relative to communities lacking the symbiont. Here, we examined potential soil-mediated mechanisms underlying these negative impacts on trees. 3. We challenged nine tree species with soil conditioned by tall fescue grass either with (E+) or without (E-) the symbiotic endophyte. We collected field soil from replicated, experimental E+ and E-field plots, sterilized half to eliminate soil microbes, then conditioned the soil in the greenhouse with either E+ or E-tall fescue. Individual tree seeds received one of five soil treatments: E-live, E sterile, E+ live, E+ sterile, or no tall fescue conditioning (control). Tree survival and biomass were assessed after approximately 80 days. 4. Soil conditioning by E+ tall fescue reduced the biomass of three tree species (Elaeagnus umbellata, Fraxinus pennsylvanica, Platanus occidentalis) and the survival of P. occidentalis relative to conditioning by E-tall fescue. However, decreased biomass occurred only in live soil, suggesting indirect effects of the endophyte via altered soil microbes. In addition, two species (F. pennsylvanica, Prunus serotina) grew larger in both unconditioned soils and E-live soil relative to all other soil treatments, and two species (Ailanthus altissima, P. occidentalis) performed poorly in all soil treatments relative to unconditioned soil. Finally, three species did not significantly respond to any soil treatment (Acer negundo, Quercus palustris, Cercis canadensis). 5. Synthesis. Our results show that negative impacts of a non-native grass on native trees can depend on both above-and below-ground microbial associations. Because tree species responded divergently to soil conditioning, the endophyte symbiosis has the potential to alter plant succession and the future composition of forest communities.","Rudgers, JA; Orr, S",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2009,10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01478.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.981241492435755,TRUE,2,8,Low,sterile,sterile; examined; examined; assessed; collected; tested,NA,"slowing plant succession from grassland to forest relative to communities lacking the symbiont.

17202,"Impact of swapping soils on the endophytic bacterial communities of pre-domesticated, ancient and modern maize.","Endophytes are microbes that live within plants such as maize (corn, Zea mays L.) without causing disease. It is generally assumed that most endophytes originate from soil. If this is true, then as humans collected, domesticated, bred and migrated maize globally from its native Mexico, they moved the species away from its native population of endophyte donors. The migration of maize persists today, as breeders collect wild and exotic seed (as sources of diverse alleles) from sites of high genetic diversity in Mexico for breeding programs on distant soils. When transported to new lands, it is unclear whether maize permits only selective colonization of microbes from the Mexican soils on which it co-evolved, tolerates shifts in soil-derived endophytes, or prevents colonization of soil-based microbes in favour of seed-transmitted microbes. To test these hypotheses, non-sterilized seeds of three types of maize (pre-domesticated-Mexican, ancient-Mexican, modern-temperate) were planted side-by-side on indigenous Mexican soil, Canadian temperate soil or sterilized sand. The impact of these soil swaps on founder bacterial endophyte communities was tested using 16S-rDNA profiling, culturing and microbial trait phenotyping. Multivariate analysis showed that bacterial 16S-rDNA TRFLP profiles from young, surface-sterilized maize plants were more similar when the same host genotype was grown on the different soils than when different maize genotypes were grown on the same soil. There appeared to be two reasons for this result. First, the largest fraction of bacterial 16S-signals from soil-grown plants was shared with parental seeds and/or plants grown on sterilized sand, suggesting significant inheritance of candidate endophytes. The in vitro activities of soil-derived candidate endophytes could be provided by bacteria that were isolated from sterile sand grown plants. Second, many non-inherited 16S-signals from sibling plants grown on geographically-distant soils were shared with one another, suggesting maize can select microbes with similar TRFLP peak sizes from diverse soils. Wild, pre-domesticated maize did not possess more unique 16S-signals when grown on its native Mexican soil than on Canadian soil, pointing against long-term co-evolutionary selection. The modern hybrid did not reject more soil-derived 16S-signals than did ancestral maize, pointing against such rejection as a mechanism that contributes to yield stability across environments. A minor fraction of 16S-signals was uniquely associated with any one soil. Within the limits of TRFLP profiling, the candidate bacterial endophyte populations of pre-domesticated, ancient and modern maize are partially buffered against the effects of geographic migration --- from a Mexican soil associated with ancestral maize, to a Canadian soil associated with modern hybrid agriculture. These results have implications for understanding the effects of domestication, migration, ex situ seed conservation and modern breeding, on the microbiome of one of the world's most important food crops.",Johnston-Monje D; Mousa WK; Lazarovits G; Raizada MN,BMC plant biology,2014,10.1186/s12870-014-0233-3,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.8251709038971,TRUE,2,8,Low,sterile,isolated; sterile; ITS; collected; tested,"vitro activities of soil-derived candidate endophytes could be provided by bacteria that were isolated from sterile sand grown plants.

7886,Towards resolving Nothophaeocryptopus and Rhizosphaera inhabitants of spruce needles,"Our knowledge of the endophytic fungal community associated with needles of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) is rather limited, which contrasts with the importance of this tree species for forestry in the UK. In our study, we focused on the detailed characterization of multiple isolates tentatively placed into the genera Nothophaeocryptopus and Rhizosphaera that were obtained from needles of Sitka spruce and co-occurring Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) at four sites in Scotland and Wales. After a thorough analysis of their phenotype and analysis of two nuclear regions (ITS rDNA and gene for beta-tubulin), we propose two species new to science and one new combination. Nothophaeocryptopus piceae was isolated from healthy green or brown needles from spruces and is currently known only as a sterile culture, but the taxonomic novelty is well supported by host affinity and results of molecular data analysis. Rhizosphaera minteri may also be distinguished based on the combination of host and molecular data, but morphologically, it is similar to R. pini. Finally, Hormonema merioides and R. pseudotsugae are found to be conspecific and a new combination R. merioides is proposed following the phylogenetic placement of this species. Our study highlights the importance of multiple approaches used in the identification of microfungi associated with coniferous needles. It is evident that morphologically identical fungi may represent distinct species differing in their host range and severity on the host.

19378,Microbiome contributes to phenotypic plasticity in saffron crocus.,"Saffron crocus is a sterile plant species that propagates vegetatively, and consequently, narrow genetic variation is detected in this species. Besides the narrow genetic variation, there is significant phenotypic variation in different traits in this plant. Here we tested this hypothesis that plant microbiome is a major contributor to the phenotypic variation. We focused our analysis on culturable bacteria that were dominant in saffron fields with high stigma yield compared to the fields with low stigma yield. Following this strategy, four rhizospheric (Cupriavidus metallidurans, Bacillus sp., Solibacillus sp., and Planococcus sp.) and two endophytic bacteria (Serratia oryzae and S. odorifera) were identified. The effects of the bacteria on the growth and development of the model plant Arabidopsis were assessed both in agar plate and pot assays. Results showed that these bacteria influence the vegetative growth and flowering time of Arabidopsis. In the next step, corms of saffron were inoculated with these bacteria and the growth and development of the saffron plants were monitored for five months. Remarkably, inoculation of the bacteria had significant influence on vegetative growth, flowering time, and stigma yield of saffron crocus. Furthermore, one of the bacteria, C. metallidurans, is reported here for the first time as a naturally occurring plant-associated bacteria.

860,Bud endophytes of Scots pine produce adenine derivatives and other compounds that affect morphology and mitigate browning of callus cultures,"Endophytes are found in meristematic bud tissues of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) especially prior to growth, which would suggest their involvement in growth of the bud. To test this hypothesis, production of phytohormones by two bacterial (Methylobacterium extorquens, Pseudomonas synxantha) and one fungal endophyte (Rhodotorula minuta) was studied by mass spectrometry. The most common gibberellins, auxins, or cytokinins were not detected in the fractions studied. Instead, M. extorquens and R. minuta produced adenine derivatives that may be used as precursors in cytokinin biosynthesis. A plant tissue culture medium was conditioned with the endophytes, and pine tissue cultures were started on the media. Tetracycline inhibited callus production, which was restored on the endophyte-conditioned media. In addition, conditioning mitigated browning of the Scots pine explants. However, a decrease in tissue size was observed on the endophyte-conditioned media. Addition of adenosine monophosphate in the plant culture medium restored callus production and increased growth of the tissues, but had no effect on browning.

9412,Seed and Root Endophytic Fungi in a Range Expanding and a Related Plant Species,"Climate change is accelerating the spread of plants and their associated species to new ranges. The differences in range shift capacity of the various types of species may disrupt long-term co-evolved relationships especially those belowground, however, this may be less so for seed-borne endophytic microbes. We collected seeds and soil of the range-expanding Centaurea stoebe and the congeneric Centaurea jacea from three populations growing in Slovenia (native range of both Centaurea species) and the Netherlands (expanded range of C. stoebe, native range of C. jacea). We isolated and identified endophytic fungi directly from seeds, as well as from roots of the plants grown in Slovenian, Dutch or sterilized soil to compare fungal endophyte composition. Furthermore, we investigated whether C. stoebe hosts a reduced community composition of endophytes in the expanded range due to release from plant-species specific fungi while endophyte communities in C. jacea in both ranges are similar. We cultivated 46 unique and phylogenetically diverse endophytes. A majority of the seed endophytes resembled potential pathogens, while most root endophytes were not likely to be pathogenic. Only one endophyte was found in both roots and seeds, but was isolated from different plant species. Unexpectedly, seed endophyte diversity of southern C. stoebe populations was lower than of populations from the north, while the seed endophyte community composition of northern C. stoebe populations was significantly different southern C. stoebe as well as northern and southern C. jacea populations. Root endophyte diversity was considerably lower in C. stoebe than in C. jacea independent of plant and soil origin, but this difference disappeared when plants were grown in sterile soils. We conclude that the community composition of fungal endophytes not only differs between related plant species but also between populations of plants that expand their range compared to their native habitat. Our results suggest that fungal endophytes of two Centaurea species are not able to systemically infect plants. We highlight that endophytes remain poorly studied and further work should investigate the functional importance of endophytes.","Geisen, S; Kostenko, O; Cnossen, MC; ten Hooven, FC; Vres, B; van der Putten, WH",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2017,10.3389/fmicb.2017.01645,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.9623717892535,TRUE,2,7,Low,sterile,isolated; sterile; investigated; studied; collected,"independent of plant and soil origin, but this difference disappeared when plants were grown in sterile soils.

1805,"Distribution, colonization and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi associated with central Himalayan rhododendrons","The objective of the present study was to investigate arbuscular mycorrhizal status of five species of rhododendrons distributed in Kumaun region of the Indian Central Himalaya. Root and rhizosphere soil samples of all the five species of rhododendrons, namely, Rhododendron anthopogon, R. arboreum, R. campanulatum, R. barbatum and R. lepidotum were collected from temperate, sub-alpine to alpine location in altitudinal range from 1500 to 4500 m amsl. The arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization in root samples ranged from 28 to 42%; and maximum and minimum colonization was observed in R. arboreum and R. lepidotum, respectively. The highest number of intraradical vesicles (12.5 +/- 2.8 cm(-1) root segment) was recorded in R. arboreum and the lowest (7.0 +/- 1.7 cm(-1) root segment) in R. barbatum; vesicles were not observed in R. lepidotum. Spores were extracted from the rhizosphere soil by wet sieving to perform microscopic identification of the species. The maximum and minimum populations of spores were detected in the rhizosphere soil samples of R. anthopogon (52.0 +/- 1.5 spores 25 g(-1) soil) and R. lepidotum (32.0 +/- 2.5 spore 25 g(-1) soil), respectively. Spore populations were found to belong to five genera-Acaulospora, Glomus, Gigaspora, Sclerocystis and Scutellispora; genus Glomus was found to be dominant in the rhizosphere soil samples of all the rhododendron species. The most frequent and abundant species was G. fasciculatum, however, this species was not isolated from the rhizosphere soil of R. barbatum. Finger millet (Eleucine coracana) was used to cultivate the trap culture of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to confirm the species identity.

However, the beneficial effect of Trichoderma on inducing resistance against insect herbivores has been underexplored. Among diverse Trichoderma species, consistent with previous reports, we showed that root colonization by T. virens triggered induced systemic resistance (ISR) to the leaf-infecting hemibiotrophic fungal pathogens Colletotrichum graminicola. Whether T. virens induces ISR to insect pests has not been tested before. In this study, we investigated whether T. virens affects jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and defense against fall armyworm (FAW) and western corn rootworm (WCR). Unexpectedly, the results showed that T. virens colonization of maize seedlings grown in autoclaved soil suppressed wound-induced production of JA, resulting in reduced resistance to FAW. Similarly, the bacterial endophyte Pseudomonas chlororaphis 30-84 was found to suppress systemic resistance to FAW due to reduced JA. Further comparative analyses of the systemic effects of these endophytes when applied in sterile or non-sterile field soil showed that both T. virens and P. chlororaphis 30-84 triggered ISR against C. graminicola in both soil conditions, but only suppressed JA production and resistance to FAW in sterile soil, while no significant impact was observed when applied in non-sterile soil.

Yet some Fusarium species are found in planta without causing disease or even in a symbiotic relationship with its host. In this study we identified and characterized the Fusarium species isolated from soil, and from healthy and diseased bulbs of Lilium longiflorum grown in New Jersey and Oregon in the United States. The predominant Fusarium species from the Oregon location were F. solani (74%) and F. oxysporum (20%), whereas F. concentricum (43%) and F. proliferatum (26%), both belonging to the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex (GFSC), were the most commonly isolated species from New Jersey. To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. concentricum associated with Liliaceae. All of the isolates were characterized with sequences of the internal transcribed spacer and translation elongation factor 1-alpha genes. The 24 GFSC isolates were further characterized with mating type, mating population, and mycotoxin analysis. Results showed that all GFSC isolates were MAT-2, suggesting that the populations may be asexually reproducing in the region examined. The majority of the GFSC isolates produced beauvericin.

1536,The biology of mycorrhiza in the Ericaceae .19. Fungal mycelium as a nitrogen source for the ericoid mycorrhizal fungus Hymenoscyphus ericae and its host plants,"Measurements of the chitin content of the rooting horizons of a typical mor-humus heathland soil, indicate that chitin can contain in excess of 20 % of the total nitrogen in the litter (L) horizon and 30 % in the fermentation (F) horizon. Much of this chitin-nitrogen is thought to be contained in the mycelial walls of soil fungi. Experiments were therefore designed to test the hypothesis that such sources of N could be rendered accessible to the ericaceous plants by their fungal endophytes. Mycelium of the ericoid endophyte Hymenoscyphus ericae (Read) Korf & Kernan and of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus bovinus (Fr.) O. Krantze were grown in liquid culture before being killed and added either in the intact condition, or after fractionation, as sole sources of N to sterile media upon which were grown H. ericae in pure culture, or mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants of Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait. and Calluna vulgaris L. The abilities of the test organisms to utilize the nitrogen contained in the intact mycelial necromass, or in its fractions, were assessed by determining their yields and nitrogen concentrations of their tissues. It was revealed that H. ericae was able to produce significantly higher yield when grown on intact fungal necromass than when provided with equivalent concentrations of N in the form of ammonium. Its yields on mycelial fractions were lower, but still significantly greater than those obtained in the controls lacking N. Significantly greater yields and N contents were also found in the ericaceous plants grown with these nitrogenous substrates in the mycorrhizal condition. Without H. ericae they had no access to the substrates. The possible ecological implications of these results are discussed.","Kerley, SJ; Read, DJ",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,1997,10.1046/j.1469-8137.1997.00778.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.925798782239056,TRUE,2,7,Low,sterile,culture; sterile; ITS; assessed,"added either in the intact condition, or after fractionation, as sole sources of N to sterile media upon which were grown H. ericae in pure culture, or mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants","Kernan and of the ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus bovinus (Fr.)

16150,Exploration of mechanism of endophytic fungus Metacordyceps LrRF8 in promoting the accumulation of alkaloids in Lycoris radiata,"The effects of endophytic fungus Metacordyceps Sung LrRF8 on dry mass of leaves, bulbs, and roots of Lycoris radiata (L'H6r.) Herb., accumulation of NO, H2O2, IAA, SA, and GA, and expression of key genes involved in Amaryllidaceae alkaloid biosynthesis were investigated by establishing a interaction system of single endophytic fungus-sterile tissue-cultured L. radiata seedlings, and the mechanism by which LrRF8 promotes alkaloid accumulation in L. radiata was elucidated. The results show that compared with the control ( non-inoculation) group, LrRF8 inoculation significantly increases the contents of galanthamine in leaves and bulbs and narciclasine, lycorine, and galanthamine in roots. Further studies reveal that LrRF8 inoculation can induce differential bursts of NO and H2O2 in different tissues of L. radiata, with the most significant induction effect in roots; meanwhile, LrRF8 inoculation causes differential accumulation of IAA, SA, and GA in different tissues of L. radiata, primarily promotes GA accumulation in leaves and IAA and SA accumulation in roots. Additionally, LrRF8 inoculation for 7 d significantly increases the relative expression of PAL and OMT in leaves and bulbs, and PAL in roots of L. radiata ； LrRF8 inoculation for 14 d significantly increases the relative expression of PAL and CYP96T1 in leaves, PAL in bulbs, and PAL, TYDC and CYP96T1 in roots. In the whole seedling, exogenous application of signaling molecules and plant hormones can promote alkaloid accumulation in L. radiata, the exogenous application of SNP increases the relative expression of CYP96T1, exogenous application of H2O2 upregulates those of TYDC , OMT, and CYP96T1, exogenous application of IAA elevates that of TYDC, exogenous application of SA enhances those of PAL and CYP96T1, and exogenous application of GA promotes those of OMT and CYP96T1. In conclusion, compared with pot culture systems, the single endophytic fungus-sterile tissue-cultured L. radiata seedlings interaction system established in this study eliminates the interference from environmental microorganisms and demonstrates that LrRF8 inoculation promotes alkaloid accumulation in L. radiata, among which NO, H2O2 , and IAA, SA and GA signals play crucial regulatory roles at gene expression level. © 2025, Editorial Office, Journal of Plant Resources and Environment.

13226,Structure and development of the endophyte in the parasitic angiosperm Cuscuta japonica,"The endophyte, that is, the haustorial part within the tissues of the host plant Impatiens balsamina, of the parasitic angiosperm Cuscuta japonica was studied with light and electron microscopy. The endophyte consisted mainly of vacuolated parenchymatous axial cells and elongate, superficial (epidermal) cells. Then the elongate, epidermal cells separated from each other and transformed into filamentous cells, called searching hyphae. The hyphae grew independently either intercellularly or intracellularly in the host parenchyma. The apical end of the hyphal cells was characterized by conspicuous, large nuclei with enlarged nucleoli and very dense cytoplasm with abundant organelles, suggesting that the hyphal cells penetrating host tissue were metabolically very active. Numerous osmiophilic particles and chloroplasts were noted in the hyphae. The osmiophilic particles were assumed to be associated with elongation of the growing hyphe. Plasmodemata connections between the searching hyphal cells of the parasite and the host parenchyma cells were not detected. Hyphal cells that reached the host xylem differentiated into water-conducting xylic hyphae by thickening of the secondary walls. A xylem bridge connecting the parasite and the host was confirmed from serial sections. Some hyphal cells that reached the host phloem differentiated into nutrient-conducting phloic hyphae. Phloic hyphae had a thin layer of peripheral cytoplasm with typical features of sieve-tube members in autotrophic angiosperms, i.e., parallel arrays of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and plastids with starch granules. Interspecific open connections via the sieve pores of the host sieve elements and plasmodesmata of the parasite phloic hyphae were very rarely observed, indicating that the symplastic translocation of assimilate to the parasite from the host occurred. © The Botanical Society of Korea 2009.",Lee K.B.,Journal of Plant Biology,2009,10.1007/s12374-009-9046-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.984685545427545,TRUE,2,7,Low,not detected,microscopy; observed; electron microscopy; studied,NA,"the tissues of the host plant Impatiens balsamina, of the parasitic angiosperm Cuscuta japonica was studied with light and electron microscopy.

20076,SIMULATED ACID-RAIN AFFECTS BIRCH LEAF ENDOPHYTE POPULATIONS,"Endophytes were frequently isolated from mountain birch (Betula pubescens var. tortuosa (Ledeb.) Nyman) leaves at a subarctic site where natural air pollution is low. We tested whether simulated acid rain had any influence on the occurrence of endophytes. Dry controls with only ambient rain and irrigated controls treated with spring water of pH 6 were compared with acid treatments at pH 3 and pH 4, prepared by adding both sulphuric and nitric acids. Treatments began in 1985 and leaf samples were taken twice during the summer of 1992. Leaves were surface sterilized, five leaf disks from each leaf placed on malt extract agar, and growing colonies were counted and identified. The most frequently isolated endophyte from birch leaves was a Fusicladium anamorph of Venturia sp. (88% of all the isolates in July and 75% of all the isolates in August), followed by a sterile mycelium and Melanconium sp. The number of endophytes isolated and the species number increased from July to August. Endophytes were most frequently isolated from the basal part of the midrib. The percentage of colonization by endophytes was similar in short and long shoots. More endophytes were isolated from leaves of branches taken at 1 m height than at 2 m height. The stronger acid rain treatment (pH 3) reduced by approximately 25% the number of isolated endophytes in August.

19174,Taxonomic profiling of Nasutitermes takasagoensis microbiota to investigate the role of termites as vectors of bacteria linked to ironwood tree decline in Guam.,"The ironwood tree (Casuarina equisetifolia, family Casuarinaceae), an indigenous agroforestry species in Guam, has been threatened by ironwood tree decline (IWTD) since 2002. Formation of bacterial ooze by the wilt pathogen from the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex and wetwood bacteria (primarily Klebsiella species) has been linked to IWTD. In addition, termite infestation of trees was statistically associated with IWTD. Termites are known carriers of a diverse microbiome. Therefore, we hypothesized that termites could be vectors of bacteria linked to IWTD. To investigate the potential role of termites as pathogen vectors, we employed next-generation 16S rRNA gene sequencing to describe the bacteria diversity of Nasutitermes takasagoensis (Family Termitidae) workers collected from 42 ironwood trees of different disease stages in Guam in association with tree-, plot-, and location-related factors. Nasutitermes takasagoensis workers account for the majority of termite infestations of ironwood trees. The bacterial phyla composition of N. takasagoensis workers was typical for wood-feeding higher termites consisting mainly of Spirochaetes and Fibrobacteres. However, Ralstonia species were not detected and Klebsiella species were rare even in termites collected from trees infected with Ralstonia and wetwood bacteria. Feeding experiments suggested that termites prefer to consume wood with low pathogen content over wood with high pathogen load. Termites were able to ingest Ralstonia but Ralstonia could not establish itself in healthy termite bodies. We concluded that N. takasagoensis workers are not vectors for Ralstonia spp. or the bacterial endophytes associated with wetwood (Klebsiella, Pantoea, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Erwinia) that were previously observed in IWTD-infested trees.

16644,First Report of Downy Mildew of Opium Poppy Caused by Peronospora arborescens in Spain.,"Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is an economically important pharmaceutical crop in Spain with approximately 7,400 ha cultivated annually. In the spring of 2004, severe attacks by a new foliar disease were observed approximately 500 km apart in commercial opium poppy fields in the Castilla-La Mancha and Andalusia regions of central and southern Spain, respectively. The incidence of affected fields ranged from 40 to 50%, and incidence of diseased plants ranged from 20 to 30%. Initial disease symptoms included irregularly shaped, chlorotic-to-light yellow leaf lesions (ranging in size from 0.5 to 4 cm). Affected tissues curled, thickened, and became deformed and necrotic as disease developed. Lesions expanded in size and often coalesced, eventually giving rise to large necrotic areas in leaves or death of entire leaves. In wet weather or conditions of high relative humidity, a dense felt of sporangiophores with sporangia was produced on the abaxial leaf surface and occasionally on the adaxial surface. Microscopic observations revealed sporangiophores branching dichotomically at least four to six times, ending with sterigmata bearing single sporangia. Sporangia were hyaline, elliptical to spherical in shape, and measured 18 to 24 × 14 to 18 μm (average 19 ± 1.2 × 15 ± 1.6 μm). Occasionally, oospores formed in necrotic leaf tissues. Oospores were dark brown (the surface was irregularly ridged) and measured 36 to 46 μm in diameter (average 39 ± 4.4 μm). The oospore wall was 3 to 11 μm thick. On the basis of the observed morphological features of six symptomatic plant samples from fields at Castilla-La Mancha and Andalusia regions, we identified the pathogen as Peronospora arborescens (1). Pathogenicity was confirmed by inoculating 4- to 6-week-old opium poppy plants (cv. nigrum) with an isolate collected from a field in Ecija, Andalusia. Seed of test plants was surface disinfested and germinated under sterile conditions. Plants were sprayed with a suspension of 1 to 5 × 105 sporangia per ml in sterile distilled water. Plants sprayed with sterile water served as controls. There were five replicate plants per treatment. Plants were enclosed in sealed plastic bags and kept in the dark for 24 h. This was followed by incubation in a growth chamber at 21°C, 60 to 90% relative humidity, and a 12-h photoperiod (fluorescent light: 360 μE·m-2·s-1). After 5 to 7 days, typical downy mildew symptoms developed in inoculated plants. All control plants remained symptomless. Sporulation by the pathogen on symptomatic leaves occurred when affected plants were sprayed with water, enclosed in sealed plastic bags, and incubated at 21°C in the dark for 24 h. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. arborescens infecting opium poppy in Spain. Infestations of poppy weeds (Papaver rhoeas) and wild Papaver somniferum were also observed in affected opium poppy fields, which may bear importance in the epidemiology of the disease as alternative hosts for inoculum increase and survival of P. arborescens under field conditions.

4374,Evaluation of new fermentation and formulation strategies for a high endophytic establishment of Beauveria bassiana in oilseed rape plants,"Since several years it is known that strains of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo-Crivelli) Vuillemin (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) are able to colonize plants as a true endophyte. However, so far no integrated bioprocess engineering approaches have been published where fermentation and formulation strategies are combined to optimize colonization of oilseed rape plant tissues. We therefore aimed at investigating whether and how blastospore (BS) formation can be shifted to resilient submerged conidiospores (SCS) by introducing osmotic stress in different growth phases. When 50 g/L NaCl was added after 48 h to a culture of B. bassiana a yield of 1.4 +/- 0.1 x 10(10) SCS/g sucrose in shake flasks and 1.8 +/- 0.1 x 10(10) SCS/g sucrose in a stirred tank reactor were obtained. In a bioreactor, 24 h after the addition of NaCl, the formation of BS slowed down, the respiratory quotient decreased and a shift from BS to SCS set in. Following these steps, different formulation strategies, namely encapsulation, film coating and liquid formulation were evaluated. B. bassiana grew out of beads as well as on commercial fungicide-coated seeds. Due to the complete suppression of fungal growth on non-sterile soil, the most suitable option was a foliar application. A liquid formulation consisting of 0.1% Triton X-114, 1% molasses, 1% titanium dioxide and 10(6) spores/mL was applied on leaf tips. After 14 days, the endophyte was detected by PCR and microscopic analysis in the leaves.

5410,Establishment of the fungal entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana as a season long endophyte in jute (Corchorus olitorius) and its rapid detection using SCAR marker,"An experiment was conducted to introduce the entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) as an endophyte in jute (Corchorus olitorius), a bast fibre crop through seed treatment. Colonization of root, leaf, stem, capsule, and seed were assessed through plating on selective medium and PCR based detection using B. bassiana specific SCAR markers. Endophytic colonization was detected in all the plants grown from treated seeds, but all the plant parts were not colonized. Colonization was detected in leaves, stems, and green capsules but not in roots and seeds. The endophytic colonization was influenced by both plant part and sampling period.

8637,Diversity of endophytic fungi of single Norway spruce needles and their role as pioneer decomposers,"The diversity of endophytic fungi within single symptomless Norway spruce needles is described and their possible role as pioneer decomposers after needle detachment is investigated. The majority (90%) of all 182 isolates from green intact needles were identified as Lophodermium piceae. Up to 34 isolates were obtained from single needles. Generally, all isolates within single needles had distinct randomly amplified microsatellite (RAMS) patterns. Single trees may thus contain a higher number of L. piceae individuals than the number of their needles. To investigate the ability of needle endophytes to act as pioneer decomposers, surface-sterilized needles were incubated on sterile sand inoculated with autoclaved or live spruce forest humus layer. The dry weight loss of 13-17% found in needles after a 20-week incubation did not significantly differ between the sterilized and live treatments. Hence, fungi surviving the surface sterilization of needles can act as pioneer decomposers. A considerable portion of the needles remained green during the incubation. brown and black needles, in which the weight loss had presumably taken place, were invaded throughout by single haplotypes different from L, piceae. Instead, Tiarasporella parca, a less common needle endophyte, occurred among these invaders of brown needles. Needle endophytes of Norway spruce seem thus to have different abilities to decompose host tissues after needle cast. L. piceae is obviously not an important pioneer decomposer of Norway spruce needles. The diversity of fungal individuals drops sharply when needles start to decompose. Thus, in single needles the decomposing mycota is considerably less diverse than the endophytic mycota.","Müller, MM; Valjakka, R; Suokko, A; Hantula, J",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2001,10.1046/j.1365-294X.2001.01304.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.932345116939448,TRUE,2,7,Low,sterile,incubated; sterile; amplified; investigated,"the ability of needle endophytes to act as pioneer decomposers, surface-sterilized needles were incubated on sterile sand inoculated with autoclaved or live spruce forest humus layer.

The interaction between endophytic Paenibacillus and Serratia strains and the host plant is shaped by plant growth conditions,"Aims: Verticillium wilt is difficult to suppress, and causes severe yield losses in a broad range of crops. Five Serratia and five Paenibacillus endophytic isolates showing antagonistic properties against fungal pathogens were compared for their plant growth-promoting (PGP) potential under different plant growth conditions with the objective of evaluating the PGP of endophytic strains in different ad planta systems. Methods: Preselected isolates were applied to the surface-sterilized seeds of oilseed rape and cauliflower using bio-priming. The isolates’ PGP effect and root colonization capacities were compared under gnotobiotic conditions. One strain from each genus was selected and tested for its PGP qualities in sterile and non-sterile soil. Results: Serratia treatment resulted in different levels of PGP, while Paenibacillus strains damaged roots under gnotobiotic conditions.

9829,"Interactions among endophytic fungal entomopathogens (Ascomycota: Hypocreales), the green peach aphid Myzus persicae Sulzer (Homoptera: Aphididae), and the aphid endoparasitoid Aphidius colemani Viereck (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)","Entomopathogenic fungi are typically applied as innundative sprays with the expectation of short-term pest control, but a growing number of studies demonstrate the potential of these fungi to endophytically colonize a wide variety of plants and confer longer-term protection. Endophytic colonization of plants by fungal entomopathogens can also enable these fungi to establish intricate interactions in a tritrophic context; thus affecting other groups of natural enemies such as parasitoids. Yet to date, effects of endophytic plant colonization on parasitoids have mostly been investigated using the grass-endophyte organism systems. The present study investigates the effects of the fungal entomopathogens Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium brunneum, following their endophytic colonization of sweet pepper Capsicum annum, on the development and fecundity of two successive generations of the green peach aphid Myzus persicae in addition to parasitism by the aphid endoparasitoid Aphidius colemani in two replicate greenhouse experiments. Plant roots were drenched with the conidial suspension of each fungal strain or sterile water, and the endophytic colonization of different plant parts (root, stem, and leaf) was confirmed 7 (when 1st generation M. persicae started feeding on caged treatment plants) and 17 (when A. colemani started parasitizing 2nd generation M. persicae reared on caged treatment plants) days post-inoculation (dpi). Inoculation with the tested fungal entomopathogens enhanced several plant growth parameters that were sampled 7 dpi (before M. persicae infestation) and all plant growth parameters sampled 35 dpi (following infestation with two successive generations of M. persicae). Fewer numbers of aphids were found when sampling plants inoculated with both fungal strains in comparison to the control during the development and reproduction of 1st and 2nd generations of M. persicae. The negative effects of plant colonization with the inoculated fungal strains on aphid development and fecundity also included prolonged development time, delayed onset of reproduction, and reduced birth rate. On the other hand, the percentage mummification and adult emergence of A. colemani progenies parasitizing 2nd generation aphid reared on inoculated or control plants were not affected by plant colonization with B. bassiana and M. brunneum. In addition, no differences were observed in development time, percentage female, and adult longevity of A. colemani progenies among inoculated and control plants.

Cacao supports a complex endophytic microbial community that offers candidates for biocontrol of cacao diseases. Endophytic isolates of Trichoderma species were isolated from the live sapwood of trunks of Theobroma species, pods of Theobroma species, and a liana (Banisteriopsis caapi). Fifteen isolates of Trichoderma, potentially representing seven species, were selected for characterization of the influence of seedling inoculation on the establishment of endophytic growth in cacao seedlings. An isolate of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was also included. The isolates studied in vitro varied in their abilities to produce metabolites inhibitory to Moniliophthora roreri and in their abilities to parasitize M. roreri cultures. The five inoculation methods used were: (1) inoculation of germinating seed on agar plates; (2) plate inoculation followed by planting in sterile soil; (3) planting sterile seed in pre-inoculated soil; (4) inoculation of emerged seedlings at the soil surface; and (5) inoculation of emerged seedlings between the cotyledon and stem. All the isolates studied were able to colonize Theobroma cacao seedlings, but isolates DIS 110a (Trichoderma cf. harzianum), DIS 219b (T hamatum), DIS 219f (T. harzianum), and TA (T asperellum) were the most efficient across inoculation methods. These same isolates also caused moderate to severe discoloration of roots of cacao seedlings germinated on water agar plates. Isolates DIS 173a (T. spirale), DIS 185c (T stromaticum), and Col (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides) were inefficient colonizers of cacao. Most of the isolates studied were able to establish an endophytic relationship with cacao by colonizing the above ground portions of the cacao seedling, and exploitation of this characteristic could lead to the development of novel biocontrol strategies for control of cacao diseases.

2164,Invasive plants can inhibit native tree seedlings: testing potential allelopathic mechanisms,"The mechanisms by which invasive species affect native communities are not well resolved. For example, invasive plants may influence other species through competition, altered ecosystem processes, or other pathways. We investigated one potential mechanism by which invasive plants may harm native species, allelopathy. Specifically, we explored whether native tree species respond differently to potential allelopathic effects of two invasive plant species. We assessed the separate effects of Lolium arundinaceam (tall fescue) and Elaeagnus umbellata (autumn olive) on three common successional tree species: Acer saccharinum (silver maple), Populus deltoides (eastern cottonwood), and Platanus occidentalis (sycamore). Tall fescue and autumn olive are widely planted and highly invasive or persistent throughout North America where they often grow in forest edges, old fields, and other sites colonized by pioneering tree species. In an exploratory greenhouse experiment, we applied aqueous extracts derived from soil, leaf litter, or live leaves to native trees. We compared these treatments to a sterile water control and also to minced leaves leached in water, a common, but potentially less realistic method of testing for allelopathy. For all tree species, minced leaves from tall fescue reduced the probability that seedlings emerged, and minced leaves of autumn olive reduced the number of days to emergence. During other demographic stages, the three native tree species diverged in their responses to the invasive plants. Platanus occidentalis exhibited the widest range of responses, with reduced root biomass due to minced tissue from both invasive species, reduced days to emergence and marginally reduced survival from minced tall fescue, and reduced leaf biomass from tall fescue leaf litter. Populus deltoides appeared insensitive to most extracts, although survival was marginally increased with application of minced or fresh leaf extracts from autumn olive. In addition, minced tall fescue shortened the time to seedling emergence for Acer saccharinum, potentially a positive effect. Overall, results suggest that allelopathy may be one mechanism underlying the negative impacts of tall fescue and autumn olive on other plant species, but that effects can depend strongly upon the source of allelochemicals and the tree species examined.","Orr, SP; Rudgers, JA; Clay, K",PLANT ECOLOGY,2005,10.1007/s11258-005-5698-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.910442920916261,TRUE,2,7,Low,sterile,sterile; examined; investigated; examined; assessed,"soil, leaf litter, or live leaves to native trees.

5437,Specificity of root microbiomes in native-grown Nicotiana attenuata and plant responses to UVB increase Deinococcus colonization,"Plants recruit microbial communities from the soil in which they germinate. Our understanding of the recruitment process and the factors affecting it is still limited for most microbial taxa. We analysed several factors potentially affecting root microbiome structure - the importance of geographic location of natural populations, the microbiome of native seeds as putative source of colonization and the effect of a plant's response to UVB exposure on root colonization of highly abundant species. The microbiome of Nicotiana attenuata seeds was determined by a culture-dependent and culture-independent approach, and the root microbiome of natural N. attenuata populations from five different locations was analysed using 454-pyrosequencing. To specifically address the influence of UVB light on root colonization by Deinococcus, a genus abundant and consistently present in N. attenuata roots, transgenic lines impaired in UVB perception (irUVR8) and response (irCHAL) were investigated in a microcosm experiment with/without UVB supplementation using a synthetic bacterial community. The seed microbiome analysis indicated that N. attenuata seeds are sterile. Alpha and beta diversities of native root bacterial communities differed significantly between soil and root, while location had only a significant effect on the fungal but not the bacterial root communities. With UVB supplementation, root colonization of Deinococcus increased in wild type, but decreased in irUVR8 and irCHAL plants compared to nontreated plants. Our results suggest that N. attenuata recruits a core root microbiome exclusively from soil, with fungal root colonization being less selective than bacterial colonization. Root colonization by Deinococcus depends on the plant's response to UVB.","Santhanam, R; Oh, Y; Kumar, R; Weinhold, A; Luu, VT; Groten, K; Baldwin, IT",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2017,10.1111/mec.14049,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.950365446690262,TRUE,2,7,Low,sterile,culture; sterile; pyrosequencing; investigated,NA,"in N. attenuata roots, transgenic lines impaired in UVB perception (irUVR8) and response (irCHAL) were investigated in a microcosm experiment with/without UVB supplementation using a synthetic bacterial community.

14307,Rethinking the role of aquatic ecology in hydroponic cultivation,"Hydroponic production systems are challenged by root diseases, but can be made less susceptible to infection. While the systems are mostly unchallenged by nematodes, pathogens that can live and spread though water still cause loss of yield. Common diseases would be Phytophthora, Pythium, Fusarium and bacteria such as Erwinias and Pseudomonads. Since horticulture cannot be performed in a sterile environment on a commercial scale, insight in population dynamics of pathogens in aquatic systems as well as plants' resilience need to be understood to lower the risk of infection. This paper addresses a number of biological principles in aquatic ecology that could be used in improving system design processes as well as providing the first data on the population dynamics in chrysanthemum production on deep flow systems in The Netherlands using next generation sequencing (NGS). It was observed that free colonisation of the water leads to highly diverse bacterial populations, while inoculation with water from an established deep flow pond leads to more uniform populations in the long run. Temperature can strongly influence bacterial populations. Addition of benefical micro-organisms leads to increase plant resilience against diseases. It is yet unclear whether such reduced infection is due to direct antagonistic effect, through a plant-endophyte symbiotic relationship or through competition for nutrients (sugars) or physical space.

Additional genetic markers and a broader taxonomic sampling furthermore suggested that the sexual Hyaloscypha and the asexual Meliniomyces may be congeneric. In order to further elucidate these issues, type strains of all species traditionally treated as members of the Rhizoscyphus ericae aggregate (REA) and related taxa were subjected to phylogenetic analyses based on ITS, nrLSU, mtSSU, and rpb2 markers to produce comparable datasets while an in vitro re-synthesis experiment was conducted to examine the root-symbiotic potential of H. hepaticicola in the Ericaceae. Phylogenetic evidence demonstrates that sterile root-associated Meliniomyces, sexual Hyaloscypha and Rhizoscyphus, based on R. ericae, are indeed congeneric. To this monophylum also belongs the phialidic dematiaceous hyphomycetes Cadophora finlandica and Chloridium paucisporum. We provide a taxonomic revision of the REA; Meliniomyces and Rhizoscyphus are reduced to synonymy under Hyaloscypha. Pseudaegerita, typified by P corticalis, an asexual morph of H. spiralis which is a core member of Hyaloscypha, is also transferred to the synonymy of the latter genus. Hyaloscypha melinii is introduced as a new root-symbiotic species from Central Europe. Cadophora finlandica and C. paucisporum are confirmed conspecific, and four new combinations in Hyaloscypha are proposed. Based on phylogenetic analyses, some sexually reproducing species can be attributed to their asexual counterparts for the first time whereas the majority is so far known only in the sexual or asexual state. Hyaloscypha bicolor sporulating in vitro is reported for the first time. Surprisingly, the mycological and mycorrhizal sides of the same coin have never been formally associated, mainly because the sexual and asexual morphs of these fungi have been studied in isolation by different research communities.

11083,Symbiotic fungi in roots of Artemisia annua with special reference to endophytic colonizers,"Advances on plant-fungal interactions reveal that root symbiotic fungi actively modulate host growth, resistance response and secondary metabolism. Artemisia annua has been widely recognized as an important medicinal plant for artemisinin production, yet little is known about the fungal consortium associated with roots of A. annua. In this article, microscopic and culture-dependant methods were used to evaluate the identity and taxonomic affinities of root symbiotic fungi. Morphological evidence confirmed that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were dominant fungal group in naturally regenerated roots, but low colonization frequency in planted roots. Dark septate endophytes (DSEs) were easily found, which were characterized with dark pigmented hypha and a sclerotium-like structure in root cortex, and other endophytic fungi also occurred. A total of 36 isolates were recovered. Combined morphological and molecular identification (based on ITS sequences) determined 21 fungal taxa (genotype), which were placed into numerous lineages of Ascomycota. The best BLAST match indicated that almost half of total taxa were closely related to undescribed fungi, some of them may act as novel DSEs but experimental data were warranted. Interestingly, remarkable difference of fungal community associated with two types of roots was examined and no culturable fungi overlapped. Our findings provide some additional evidence that DSEs and other root endophytes may be as common as mycorrhizal fungi.

The results showed that the infection rate of oat seeds was 13%~100% in Huajialing Town of Gansu Province, and that was 7%~90% in Zhangbei Town of Hebei Province. A total of 30 fungi species of 13 genera were identified from the tested oat seeds, and they were mainly Alternaria sp. and Penicillium sp., among which 7 fungi species such as Alternaria porri (isolation rate, 8.05%), Arthrinium arundinis(isolation rate, 4.02%), Mucor hiemalis(isolation rate, 4.02%) and other fungus were only found in Gansu's seeds;7 fungi species such as Aspergillus ruber(isolation rate, 11.11%), Alternaria slovaca(isolation rate, 6.06%), Penicillium aurantiogriseum(isolation rate, 3.97%)and others were only isolated in Hebei. The infection rate without surface sterilization was 85%~100%, and after sterile treatment was 7%~19%.

Twelve fungal test isolates were inoculated in vitro onto sterile ectomycorrhizal and ericoid host plants. Five isolates of ectomycorrhizal origin formed ECM three isolates of ericoid origin formed ERM, but none of the tested isolates was able to form both ECM and ERM. Confirmed ectomycorrhizal strains formed the characteristic black-and-hyaline mantles of the Piceirhiza. bicolorata morphotype. This morphology represented an intermediate stage, where mantle-colour changed from light brown to black. The progressive darkening appeared to result from a gradual acropetal melanization of the outer mantle layer. The synthesis results confirm that the ability to form both ecto- and ericoid mycorrhiza symbioses has evolved within the H. ericae aggregate. In addition, a phylogeny based on ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA sequences showed that the aggregate includes the ect(endo)mycorrhizal dark septate fungus Phialophora finlandia, grouping with four of the ECM-forming strains.

2523,"Contributions of North American endophytes to the phylogeny, ecology, and taxonomy of Xylariaceae (Sordariomycetes, Ascomycota)","The Xylariaceae (Sordariomycetes) comprise one of the largest and most diverse families of Ascomycota, with at least 85 accepted genera and ca. 1343 accepted species. In addition to their frequent occurrence as saprotrophs, members of the family often are found as endophytes in living tissues of phylogenetically diverse plants and lichens. Many of these endophytes remain sterile in culture, precluding identification based on morphological characters. Previous studies indicate that endophytes are highly diverse and represent many xylariaceous genera; however, phylogenetic analyses at the family level generally have not included endophytes, such that their contributions to understanding phylogenetic relationships of Xylariaceae are not well known. Here we use a multi-locus, cumulative supermatrix approach to integrate 92 putative species of fungi isolated from plants and lichens into a phylogenetic framework for Xylariaceae. Our collection spans 1933 isolates from living and senescent tissues in five biomes across the continental United States, and here is analyzed in the context of previously published sequence data from described species and additional taxon sampling of type specimens from culture collections. We found that the majority of strains obtained in our surveys can be classified in the hypoxyloid and xylaroid subfamilies, although many also were found outside of these lineages (as currently circumscribed). Many endophytes were placed in lineages previously not known for endophytism. Most endophytes appear to represent novel species, but inferences are limited by potential gaps in public databases. By linking our data, publicly available sequence data, and records of ascomata, we identify many geographically widespread, host-generalist clades capable of symbiotic associations with diverse photosynthetic partners. Concomitant with such cosmopolitan host use and distributions, many xylariaceous endophytes appear to inhabit both living and non-living plant tissues, with potentially important roles as saprotrophs. Overall, our study reveals major gaps in the availability of multi-locus datasets and metadata for this iconic family, and provides new hypotheses regarding the ecology and evolution of endophytism and other trophic modes across the family Xylariaceae.

Tul. (= Acremonium coenophialum fide Morgan-Jones et Gams), was studied with light and electron microscopy. The fungus was intercellular and was distributed throughout the plant with the exception of roots and leaf blades. The highest concentration of the fungus occurred in the base of the leaf sheath. In the seed the fungus was sequestered between the epithelial cells of the scutellum and the starchy endosperm. The seed embryo was not infected; infection was also not evident during the early stages of seed germination. At the ultrastructural level, the parasitic relationship was established in tissues where there were intercellular spaces. Micrographs indicated that the fungus did not separate the middle lamella of host cells, nor did it produce any obvious alteration in host cell morphology. Ultrastructural characteristics of the fungus depended on the age and type of fescue tissue. Hyphal cells possessed numerous vesicular and multivesicular structures, and in some sections, the hyphal walls were inordinately thickened and with or without an extracellular matrix.

760,"First Report of Tripartite Symbiosis Potential among Soybean, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, and Dark Septate Endophytes","Successful soybean and rhizobium interaction is characterized by the formation of root nodules. This symbiosis significantly affects the growth and yield of soybeans and has long been recognized as a key factor in sustainable agricultural systems. Naturally, soybeans could form a tripartite symbiotic relationship with rhizobium and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). However, there is no information regarding the symbiotic potential of soybean, nodulating bacteria, and dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungi. This study aims to delve into new tripartite symbiosis potential, shedding light on its efficacy in improving soybean growth while reducing environmental impacts. We examined the effect of incorporating two DSEs: Cladophialophora chaetospira SK51 (Cc) and Veronaeopsis simplex Y34 (Vs), into the classic soybean-rhizobium symbiosis. Under sterile conditions, the co-inoculation of DSEs with Bradyrhizobium japonicum IncB6 (Bj) significantly increased the nodule number and dry weight, leading to the acceleration of soybean vegetative growth. Soybean nodule numbers under co-inoculation treatments-CcBj and VsBj-were significantly increased by 77.6 and 43.6%, respectively, compared to the Bj treatment. Furthermore, under the CcBj and VsBj treatments, the soybean nodule dry mass was significantly increased by 455 and 363%, respectively, compared to Bj. This finding represents the first report of new beneficial tripartite symbiosis potential for soybean nodulation and vegetative growth.","Innosensia, NLPC; Suputra, IPW; Wirya, GNAS; Narisawa, K",AGRONOMY-BASEL,2023,10.3390/agronomy13071788,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.959200072660316,TRUE,2,7,Low,sterile,sterile; ITS; examined; examined,"Cladophialophora chaetospira SK51 (Cc) and Veronaeopsis simplex Y34 (Vs), into the classic soybean-rhizobium symbiosis.

In this study, we screened novel endophytes for the ability to endophytically inhabit leaf tissues. Four endophytic bacteria were screened from the apoplastic fluids extracted from the uninfected upper leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana 3 days postinoculation (dpi) with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst). Under sterile plant growth conditions, we showed that the four isolates proliferated intercellularly in the leaf tissues of A. thaliana. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing analysis, the identities of the inoculated endophytes and the re-isolates from the leaf tissues were confirmed. Among the isolates, the two species of Rhodococcus were the first members of the genus to be identified as leaf-inhabiting endophytes. Additionally, three of the isolates showed antagonistic activities, with different levels of activity, against Fusarium oxysporum pv. conglutinans (F.o.) and/or Pst. Furthermore, the application of one isolate, Bacillus cereus KB1, on tomato plants significantly increased the disease resistance to Botrytis cinerea and Pst.

The isolates were sorted into 33 culture groups based on colonial morphology. Strains representative of the different culture groups were compared with fungi of known identity (Cenococcum geophilum, Hymenoscyphus ericae, Phialocephala dimorphospora, Phialocephala fortinii, Phialophora finlandia) using restriction fragment analysis of an amplified portion of ribosomal DNA. Cluster analysis and ordination based on restriction fragment polymorphisms indicated that two-thirds of the isolates were closely related to or conspecific with Phialocephala fortinii, which therefore appears to represent the dominant root endophyte of the subalpine site. In culture, many of the Phialocephala fortinii isolates had sclerotia composed of compact masses of darkly pigmented and irregularly lobed, thick-walled hyphae.

13417,"Claviceps phalaridis in Australia: Biology, pathology and taxonomy with a description of the new genus Cepsiclava (Hypocreales, Clavicipitaceae)","Claviceps phalaridis is a native systemic grass endophyte known only from southeastern Australia. It renders its annual and perennial hosts sterile, producing deciduous sclerotia in all florets of infected plants and occurring at a low level on its four known native hosts (species of Austrodanthonia, Austrostipa, Elymus and Microlaena). Introduced pooid grasses in the genera Bromus, Dactylis, Holcus, Hordeum, Phalaris, Lolium and Vulpia are commonly infected. Occasional infection in crops of oats and barley (Avena sativa, A. strigosa, Hordeum vulgare) has occurred. Sclerotia are composed of fungal and host floret tissues (stamens, ovary, styles and stigmas) and can germinate immediately. In the field, production of ascostromata from sclerotia is synchronised with autumn seed germination of its grass hosts and seedling infection is suspected. Two conidial anamorphs are produced, one with dry unicellular conidia developing from enteroblastically proliferating conidiophores on the apex of maturing sclerotia, the other two-celled and with apical branched appendages, arising sympodially from germinating unicellular conidia and ascospores, and in culture. The morphological and biological characteristics of C. phalaridis are distinct from those of the genus Claviceps. Of species currently placed in Claviceps, it is most similar to C. diadema and related Central and South American taxa on panicoid hosts. These species have sclerotia including host tissue but they have a sphacelial anamorph characteristic of Claviceps. It differs from Neoclaviceps, recently described parasitising ovaries of a panicoid host in Costa Rica, in producing a discrete sclerotium, a unicellular anamorph and in having mainly pooid hosts. Comparison with other genera of plant-parasitic Clavicipitaceae shows that it cannot be included in them.

In this study, diversity of culturable soil microfungal and plant communities was assessed in a disused industrial estate, at three sites featuring different nonylphenol pollution. Although soil microfungal assemblages varied widely among the sites, no significant correlation was found with point pollutant concentrations, thus suggesting indirect effects of soil contamination on microfungal assemblages. The potential of indigenous fungi and plants to remove nonylphenol was assessed in mesocosm experiments. Poplar plants and a fungal consortium consisting of the most abundant strains in the nonylphenol-polluted soil samples were tested alone or in combination for their ability to reduce, under greenhouse conditions, nonylphenol levels either in a sterile, artificially contaminated sand substrate, or in two non-sterile soils from the original industrial area. Introduction of indigenous fungi consistently reduced nonylphenol levels in all substrates, up to ca. 70% depletion, whereas introduction of the plant proved to be effective only with high initial pollutant levels. In native non-sterile soil, nonylphenol depletion following fungal inoculation correlated with biostimulation of indigenous fungi, suggesting positive interactions between introduced and resident fungi.","Girlanda, M; Favero-Longo, SE; Lazzari, A; Segreto, R; Perotto, S; Siniscalco, C",APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,2009,10.1007/s00253-008-1832-4,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.987520672213662,TRUE,2,6,Low,sterile,sterile; ITS; assessed; tested,NA,"abundant environmental pollutant with endocrine disrupting activity, is also toxic to plants and microorganisms, but its actual impact in the field is unknown.

5114,An Insight into the Secondary Metabolism of Muscodor yucatanensis: Small-Molecule Epigenetic Modifiers Induce Expression of Secondary Metabolism-Related Genes and Production of New Metabolites in the Endophyte,"Muscodor spp. are proficient producers of bioactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with many potential applications. However, all members of this genus produce varying amounts and types of VOCs which suggests the involvement of epigenetics as a possible explanation. The members of this genus are poorly explored for the production of soluble compounds (extrolites). In this study, the polyketide synthase (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes from an endophyte, Muscodor yucatanensis Ni30, were cloned and sequenced. The PKS genes belonged to reduced, partially reduced, non-reduced, and highly reduced subtypes. Strains over-expressing PKS genes were developed through the use of small-molecule epigenetic modifiers (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and 5azacytidine). The putative epigenetic variants of this organism differed considerably from the wild type in morphological features and cultural characteristics as well as metabolites that were produced. Each variant produced a different set of VOCs distinct from the wild type, and several VOCs including methyl 3-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) hexane-2,4-diol and 2-carboxymethyl-3-n-hexylmaleic appeared in the variant strains, the production of which could be attributed to the activity of otherwise silent PKS genes. The bioactive extrolite brefeldin A was isolated and characterized from the wild type. However, this metabolite was not detected in EV-1, but instead, two other products were isolated and characterized as ergosterol and xylaguaianol C. Hence, M. yucatanensis has the genetic potential to produce several previously undetectable VOCs and organic solvent soluble products. It is also the case that small-molecule epigenetic modifiers can be used to produce stable variant strains of fungi with the potential to produce new molecules. Finally, this work hints to the prospect that the epigenetics of an endophytic microorganism can be influenced by any number of environmental and chemical factors associated with its host plant which may help to explain the enormous chemical diversity of secondary metabolic products found in Muscodor spp.","Qadri, M; Nalli, Y; Jain, SK; Chaubey, A; Ali, A; Strobel, GA; Vishwakarma, RA; Riyaz-Ul-Hassan, S",MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,2017,10.1007/s00248-016-0901-y,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98796958249301,TRUE,2,6,Low,not detected,isolated; sequenced; ITS,"extrolite brefeldin A was isolated and characterized from the wild type.

6657,Diversity of endophytic fungi of common yew (Taxus baccata L.) in Iran,"To characterize the endophytic fungi of common yew, 125 fungal strains were isolated from 80 healthy twig and bark samples. Of them, 41 (32.8%) isolates were identified on the basis of morphological features and 84 (67.2%) isolates were sterile. Of the 41 morphotypes, 40 isolates belonged to 21 genera and 26 species, with an isolate as anamorphic Xylaria. Most of the identified endophytic fungi belonged to mycelia sterilia (67.2%) and Ascomycota (32%) and the others belonged to Zygomycota (0.8%). Cladosporium and Alternaria were the dominant genera. Most of the identified species are new endophytes for common yew and Pseudodictyosporium elegans, Cladosporium basi-inflatum, C. perangustum, C. subtilissimum, Geniculosporium serpens, Phoma pratorum, Paraphoma fimeti, Phomopsis archeri, Sclerostagonospora cycadis, and Seimatosporium cf. pezizoides are reported as new taxa for the mycoflora of Iran.

8229,Species identity and combinations differ in their overall benefits to Astragalus adsurgens plants inoculated with single or multiple endophytic fungi under drought conditions,"Although desert plants often establish multiple simultaneous symbiotic associations with various endophytic fungi in their roots, most studies focus on single fungus inoculation. Therefore, combined inoculation of multiple fungi should be applied to simulate natural habitats with the presence of a local microbiome. Here, a pot experiment was conducted to test the synergistic effects between three extremely arid habitat-adapted root endophytes (Alternaria chlamydospora, Sarocladium kiliense, and Monosporascus sp.). For that, we compared the effects of single fungus vs. combined fungi inoculation, on plant morphology and rhizospheric soil microhabitat of desert plant Astragalus adsurgens grown under drought and non-sterile soil conditions. The results indicated that fungal inoculation mainly influenced root biomass of A. adsurgens, but did not affect the shoot biomass. Both single fungus and combined inoculation decreased plant height (7-17%), but increased stem branching numbers (13-34%). However, fungal inoculation influenced the root length and surface area depending on their species and combinations, with the greatest benefits occurring on S. kiliense inoculation alone and its co-inoculation with Monosporascus sp. (109% and 61%; 54% and 42%). Although A. chlamydospora and co-inoculations with S. kiliense and Monosporascus sp. also appeared to promote root growth, these inoculations resulted in obvious soil acidification. Despite no observed root growth promotion, Monosporascus sp. associated with its combined inoculations maximally facilitated soil organic carbon accumulation. However, noticeably, combined inoculation of the three species had no significant effects on root length, surface area, and biomass, but promoted rhizospheric fungal diversity and abundance most, with Sordariomycetes being the dominant fungal group. This indicates the response of plant growth to fungal inoculation may be different from that of the rhizospheric fungal community. Structural equation modeling also demonstrated that fungal inoculation significantly influenced the interactions among the growth of A. adsurgens, soil factors, and rhizospheric fungal groups. Our findings suggest that, based on species-specific and combinatorial effects, endophytic fungi enhanced the plant root growth, altered soil nutrients, and facilitated rhizospheric fungal community, possibly contributing to desert plant performance and ecological adaptability. These results will provide the basis for evaluating the potential application of fungal inoculants for developing sustainable management for desert ecosystems.","Zuo, YL; Hu, QN; Qin, L; Liu, JQ; He, XL",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2022,10.3389/fpls.2022.933738,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.885712103663672,TRUE,2,6,Low,sterile,sterile; ITS; observed,NA,"their species and combinations, with the greatest benefits occurring on S. kiliense inoculation alone and its co-inoculation with Monosporascus sp.

12378,Season and Tissue Type Affect Fungal Endophyte Communities of the Indian Medicinal Plant Tinospora cordifolia More Strongly than Geographic Location,"A total of 1,151 endophytic fungal isolates representing 29 taxa were isolated from symptom-less, surface-sterilized segments of stem, leaf, petiole, and root of Tinospora cordifolia which had been collected at three locations differing in air pollution in India (Ramnagar, Banaras Hindu University, Maruadih) during three seasons (summer, monsoon, winter). Endophytes were most abundant in leaf tissues (29.38% of all isolates), followed by stem (18.16%), petiole (10.11%), and root segments (6.27%). The frequency of colonization (CF) varied more strongly among tissue type and season than location. CF was maximal during monsoon followed by winter and minimal during summer. A species each of Guignardia and Acremonium could only be isolated from leaves, whereas all other species occurred in at least two tissue types. Penicillium spp. were dominant (12.62% of all isolates), followed by Colletotrichum spp. (11.8%), Cladosporium spp. (8.9%), Chaetomium globosum (8.1%), Curvularia spp. (7.6%), and Alternaria alternata (6.8%). Species richness, evenness, and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index followed the same pattern as the CF with the tissue type and the season having the greatest effect on these indices, suggesting that tissue type and season are more influential than geography. Dissimilarity of endophyte communities in regards to species composition was highest among seasons. Colletotrichum linicola occurred almost exclusively in winter, Fusarium oxysporum only in winter and summer but never during monsoon and Curvularia lunata only in winter and during monsoon but never in summer. Emissions of NO2, SO2, and suspended particulate matter were negatively correlated with the CF. Ozone did not have any effect. The frequency of most species declined with increasing pollution, but some showed an opposite trend (e.g., Aspergillus flavus). Five unnamed taxa (sterile mycelia) were identified as Aspergillus tubingensis, Colletotrichum crassipes, Botryosphaeria rhodina, Aspergillus sydowii, and Pseudofusicoccum violaceum, using molecular tools. Fifteen of the 29 endophyte taxa exhibited antibacterial activity. B. rhodina (JQ031157) and C. globosum showed activity against all bacterial human pathogens tested, with the former showing higher activity than the latter.","Mishra, A; Gond, SK; Kumar, A; Sharma, VK; Verma, SK; Kharwar, RN; Sieber, TN",MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,2012,10.1007/s00248-012-0029-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.974055514693038,TRUE,2,6,Low,sterile,isolated; sterile; collected; tested,NA,"A total of 1,151 endophytic fungal isolates representing 29 taxa were isolated from symptom-less, surface-sterilized segments of stem, leaf, petiole, and root of Tinospora cordifolia which had | symptom-less, surface-sterilized segments of stem, leaf, petiole, and root of Tinospora cordifolia which had been collected at three locations differing in air pollution in India (Ramnagar, Banaras Hindu University, Maruadih) during",culture_absence,culture_methods; investigation_methods

In Brazil, in orchards located in Monte Azul, Minas Gerais, flowers and unripe fruits of Passiflora edulis were found with very severe and typical Phomopsis rot symptoms. The aim of this study was to prove the pathogenicity of the fungus isolated from symptomatic flowers and fruits, and to identify the pathogen's species. The isolate was identified on the basis of DNA sequence analyses based on the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region and part of the translation elongation factor-1 alpha. On culture media the colonies were sterile and pycnidia appear only on the surface of fruits. The first symptoms of the disease appeared 5 days after inoculation in flowers and after 11 days in ripe and unripe fruits inoculated at wounded sites. The pathogen was identified as Diaporthe infecunda and was re-isolated from those lesions, confirming Koch's postulates.

2588,Entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae play roles of maize (Zea mays) growth promoter,"Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae are two of the most important and widely used entomopathogenic fungi (EPFs) to control insect pests. Recent studies have revealed their function in promoting plant growth after artificial inoculation. To better assess fungal colonization and growth-promoting effects of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae on crops, maize Zea mays seedlings were treated separately with 13 B. bassiana and 73 M. anisopliae as rhizosphere fungi in a hydroponic cultural system. Plant growth indexes, including plant height, root length, fresh weight, etc., were traced recorded for 35 days to prove the growth promoting efficiency of the EPFs inoculation. Fungal recovery rate (FRR) verified that both B. bassiana and M. anisopliae could endophytically colonize in maize tissues. The recovery rates of B. bassiana in stems and leaves were 100% on the 7th day, but dropped to 11.1% in the stems and 22.2% in the leaves on the 28th day. Meanwhile, B. bassiana was not detected in the roots until the 28th day, reaching a recovery rate of 33.3%. M. anisopliae strains were isolated from the plant roots, stems and leaves throughout the tracing period with high recovery rates. The systematical colonization of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae in different tissues were further corroborated by PCR amplification of fungus-specified DNA band, which showed a higher detection sensitivity of 100% positive reaction. Fungal density comparing to the initial value in the hydroponic solution, dropped to be well below 1% on the 21st day. Thus, the two selected entomopathogenic fungal strains successfully established endophytic colonization rather than rhizospheric colonization in maize, and significantly promoted its growth in a hydroponic cultural system.

This study aimed to describe the diversity of endophytic fungi found in Oxalis latifolia Kunth. To better understand the diversity of foliar endophytic fungi found in the leaves of the medicinal plant Oxalis latifolia, we isolated and characterized endophytic by using both morphological and molecular methods employing ITS markers. The antimicrobial activity of endophytic fungi against common human pathogens Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis was also investigated.

3362,"Stochastic Inoculum, Biotic Filtering and Species-Specific Seed Transmission Shape the Rare Microbiome of Plants","A plant's health and productivity is influenced by its associated microbes. Although the common/core microbiome is often thought to be the most influential, significant numbers of rare or uncommon microbes (e.g., specialized endosymbionts) may also play an important role in the health and productivity of certain plants in certain environments. To help identify rare/specialized bacteria and fungi in the most important angiosperm plants, we contrasted microbiomes of the seeds, spermospheres, shoots, roots and rhizospheres of Arabidopsis, Brachypodium, maize, wheat, sugarcane, rice, tomato, coffee, common bean, cassava, soybean, switchgrass, sunflower, Brachiaria, barley, sorghum and pea. Plants were grown inside sealed jars on sterile sand or farm soil. Seeds and spermospheres contained some uncommon bacteria and many fungi, suggesting at least some of the rare microbiome is vertically transmitted. About 95% and 86% of fungal and bacterial diversity inside plants was uncommon; however, judging by read abundance, uncommon fungal cells are about half of the mycobiome, while uncommon bacterial cells make up less than 11% of the microbiome. Uncommon-seed-transmitted microbiomes consisted mostly of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes, Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes, which most heavily colonized shoots, to a lesser extent roots, and least of all, rhizospheres. Soil served as a more diverse source of rare microbes than seeds, replacing or excluding the majority of the uncommon-seed-transmitted microbiome. With the rarest microbes, their colonization pattern could either be the result of stringent biotic filtering by most plants, or uneven/stochastic inoculum distribution in seeds or soil. Several strong plant-microbe associations were observed, such as seed transmission to shoots, roots and/or rhizospheres of Sarocladium zeae (maize), Penicillium (pea and Phaseolus), and Curvularia (sugarcane), while robust bacterial colonization from cassava field soil occurred with the cyanobacteria Leptolyngbya into Arabidopsis and Panicum roots, and Streptomyces into cassava roots. Some abundant microbes such as Sakaguchia in rice shoots or Vermispora in Arabidopsis roots appeared in no other samples, suggesting that they were infrequent, stochastically deposited propagules from either soil or seed (impossible to know based on the available data). Future experiments with culturing and cross-inoculation of these microbes between plants may help us better understand host preferences and their role in plant productivity, perhaps leading to their use in crop microbiome engineering and enhancement of agricultural production.","Johnston-Monje, D; Gutiérrez, JP; Lopez-Lavalle, LAB",LIFE-BASEL,2022,10.3390/life12091372,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.982967825511623,TRUE,2,6,Low,sterile,sterile; ITS; observed,"soybean, switchgrass, sunflower, Brachiaria, barley, sorghum and pea.

The results showed that the P. indica successfully colonized in the roots of tobacco, increasing the content of 18 different root exudates, mainly including acids, esters, alcohols, terpenoids, and phenolic Compounds, significantly enriching the metabolism pathways of L-phenylalanine, taurine and hypotaurine, and L-tryptophan. Compared to using sterile water as a control,P. indica increased the activities of urease, sucrase, and alkaline phosphatase in tobacco rhizosphere soil,with urease and sucrase activities reaching significant levels. P. indica increased the richness and diversity of bacterial communities in tobacco rhizosphere soil,with a significant increase in Chaol index and Observed_otus index comparing with the control. This altered the bacterial Community structure at the phylum and genus levels,and increased the relative abundance of dominant phyla of Acidobacteriota and Actinobacteriaota,as well as Pseudomonas and Gemmatimonas genera. It also increased the gene abundance involved in oarbohydrate metabolism and translation pathways in rhizosphere soil bacteria, which had a certain impact on bacterial Community function.

13116,Transformation of Fusarium verticillioides with a polyketide gene cluster isolated from a fungal endophyte activates the biosynthesis of fusaric acid,"A large number of bioactive natural products have been isolated from plant endophytic fungi. However, molecular mechanisms for the biosynthesis of these metabolites have lagged behind because genetic and biochemical studies are difficult to perform within many of the endophytes. In this work, we describe our attempt to express a putative mycoepoxydiene (MED) biosynthetic gene cluster in Fusarium verticillioides, which has a well-developed genetic system for the study fungal polyke-tide biosynthesis. MED was isolated from Phomopsis sp. A123, a fungal endophyte of the mangrove plant, Kandelia candel. It has several unusual structural features and interesting biological activities. Integration of this Phomopsis gene cluster into the F. verticillioides genome led to the biosynthesis of multiple metabolites. The most highly activated metabolite was isolated and its structure was shown by 1D-and 2D-NMR to be fusaric acid, which is a mycotoxin in Fusarium species and is implicated in fungal pathogenesis. Although fusaric acid was isolated more than 70 years ago, its biosynthetic mechanism remains unclear. These transformants produced 30-35 mg fusaric acid per 100 ml culture. The high level production of fusaric acid will greatly facilitate the genetic and biochemical study of its biosynthetic mechanism.

5403,"Selecting Endophytes for Rhizome Production, Curcumin Content, Biocontrol Potential, and Antioxidant Activities of Turmeric (Curcuma longa)","Beneficial endophytes may enhance plant growth and stress tolerance. Yet, the plant health benefits of endophytes can be altered by biotic and abiotic factors and, thus, favour the inhibition of turmeric growth and curcumin production. The double petri dish method and greenhouse pot experiments were conducted to assess the biocontrol potential and impact of endophytes on the output, curcumin levels, and antioxidant activities of turmeric (Curcuma longa L.). The results showed that endophytes could control some disease-causing plant pathogens: 52% of all isolates have an antagonistic action against Fusarium oxysporum, 43% against Pythium myriotylum, 35% against Phytophthora megakarya, and 56% against Ralstonia solanacearum in vitro. Eight months after sowing, most endophyte isolates can increase the yield of turmeric rhizomes on a sterile substrate after inoculation, with yields ranging from 42 to 105% higher than the control and 3 to 50% higher than the urea treatment. In addition, 52% endophytes isolate significantly raised curcumin levels after 8 months of culture (from 2.1 to 3.1%) compared to control (1.7%) and urea treatment (1.8%). These endophytes promote an increase in the levels of reduced glutathione (22%), total thiols (26%), and carotenoids (91%) in turmeric. The study concludes that, in general, the endophytes-turmeric association can stimulate turmeric rhizome production, curcumin, and the antioxidant activities of the plant. They can also be used as biocontrol agents for plant pathogens.","Sontsa-Donhoung, AM; Bahdjolbe, M; Nwaga, D",BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL,2022,10.1155/2022/8321734,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.941408919793138,TRUE,2,6,Low,sterile,culture; petri; sterile,"months after sowing, most endophyte isolates can increase the yield of turmeric rhizomes on a sterile substrate after inoculation, with yields ranging from 42 to 105% higher than the control and","urea treatment.

This study evaluated the effectiveness of SPMs, belonging to the bacterial genera Rhizobium and Pseudomonas and a root endophytic fungus (Piriformospora indica) to improve the fitness of alfalfa under cadmium (Cd) stress. A greenhouse experiment was performed as a randomized design with factorial arrangement of treatments. Treatments included microbial inoculations (Sinorhizobium meliloti, Pseudomonas fluorescence, and P. indica) and different Cd concentrations (0, 2, 5, 10 mg/kg) with three replications in potting media containing sand and sterile perlite (v/v, 2:1). The effect of Cd on plant growth and development, antioxidant enzymes activities, and accumulation of Cd and nutrients in alfalfa plant was investigated. Alfalfa inoculated with SPMs showed significantly higher biomass and nutrients uptake under both normal and Cd stress conditions than the controls. Under the highest Cd concentration (10 mg/kg), alfalfa plants inoculated with P. fluorescens and P. indica, either alone or in combination, showed the highest shoot dry weights. Cd-induced oxidative stress was mitigated by SPMs through enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities of catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, and guaiacol peroxidase. We showed that P. indica either alone or in combination with the siderophore producing bacteria (SPB) minimized the toxicity of Cd by enhanced growth rate and the lower Cd concentration in the shoots. In conclusion, metal-resistant SPMs could assist alfalfa to survive in Cd-contaminated soil by enhancing plant growth and development. Application of plant-associated microbes is an efficient, environmentally friendly approach to surmount the adverse effects of heavy metals toxicity on plants, animals, and humans.","Sepehri, M; Khatabi, B",MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,2021,10.1007/s00248-020-01629-z,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.968161006567999,TRUE,2,6,Low,sterile,sterile; fluorescence; investigated; evaluated,"concentrations (0, 2, 5, 10 mg/kg) with three replications in potting media containing sand and sterile perlite (v/v, 2:1).

However, no research to date has characterized the colonization patterns or the nature of the interaction between host plants and coprophilous fungi associated with the roots. In our study, strains of coprophilous fungi isolated from the scats of a subterranean desert rodent were described with respect to their taxonomy and life cycle, both within the scat material and when associated with the roots of a host plant. We tested the hypothesis that coprophilous fungi have the capacity to complete their life cycle in two contrasting niches, behaving as radical fungal endophytes when associated with the roots. Twenty-three strains were isolated and identified by molecular and morphological traits, all belonging to the same clade within the Lasiosphaeriaceae family, order Sordariales. Seven different selected morphotypes were inoculated in the rhizosphere of a grass species and in sterile soil-scat substrates. Five of the seven morphotypes completed their life cycle, producing ascomata with fertile ascospores in both environments. All strains developed a conspicuous melanized mycelium around the roots. Using two different approaches, root dyeing and a regrowth assay from root segments, we detected the inoculated strains inside the roots, which colonized the parenchymal tissue asymptomatically.

This study was carried out to explore the fungal endophyte community and their distribution pattern in Asparagus racemosus and Hemidesmus indicus growing in the study area. Results: Foliar endophytes were isolated for 2 years from A. racemosus and H. indicus at four different seasons (June-August, September-November, December-February, March-May). A total of 5400 (675/season/year) leaf segments harbored 38 fungal species belonging to 17 genera, 12 miscellaneous mycelia sterile from 968 isolates and 13 had yeast like growth. In A. racemosus, Acremonium strictum and Phomopsis sp.1, were dominant with overall relative colonization densities (RCD) of 7.11% and 5.44% respectively, followed by Colletotrichum sp.3 and Colletotrichum sp.1 of 4.89% and 4.83% respectively. In H. indicus the dominant species was A. strictum having higher overall RCD of 5.06%, followed by Fusarium moniliforme and Colletotrichum sp.2 with RCD of 3.83% and 3%, respectively. Further the overall colonization and isolation rates were higher during the wet periods (September-November) in both A. racemosus (92.22% and 95.11%) and H. indicus (82% and 77.11%). Conclusion: Study samples treated with 0.2% HgCl2 and 75% EtOH for 30 s and 1 min, respectively, confirmed most favorable method of isolation of the endophytes.

Comparative analysis with the exogenous SA treatment group revealed that P. chrysanthemicola colonisation of C. pilosula exhibited an antagonistic effect on SA, mainly in carbohydrate metabolism. This phenomenon involved not only SA but also H2O2 and nitric oxide (NO) as signalling molecules. Abstract Paraphoma chrysanthemicola, an endophytic fungus isolated from the roots of Codonopsis pilosula, influences salicylic acid (SA) levels. The interaction mechanism between SA and P. chrysanthemicola within C. pilosula remains elusive. To elucidate this, an experiment was conducted with four treatments: sterile water (CK), P. chrysanthemicola (FG), SA, and a combination of P. chrysanthemicola with salicylic acid (FG+SA). Results indicated that P. chrysanthemicola enhanced plant growth and counteracted the growth inhibition caused by exogenous SA. Physiological analysis showed that P. chrysanthemicola reduced carbohydrate content and enzymatic activity in C. pilosula without affecting total chlorophyll concentration and attenuated the increase in these parameters induced by exogenous SA. Secondary metabolite profiling showed a decrease in soluble proteins and lobetyolin levels in the FG group, whereas SA treatment led to an increase. Both P. chrysanthemicola and SA treatments decreased antioxidase-like activity. Notably, the FG group exhibited higher nitric oxide (NO) levels, and the SA group exhibited higher hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels in the stems. This study elucidated the intricate context of the symbiotic dynamics between the plant species P. chrysanthemicola and C. pilosula, where an antagonistic interaction involving salicylic acid was prominently observed.

4736,Field Trials Reveal Ecotype-Specific Responses to Mycorrhizal Inoculation in Rice,"The overuse of agricultural chemicals such as fertilizer and pesticides aimed at increasing crop yield results in environmental damage, particularly in the Sahelian zone where soils are fragile. Crop inoculation with beneficial soil microbes appears as a good alternative for reducing agricultural chemical needs, especially for small farmers. This, however, requires selecting optimal combinations of crop varieties and beneficial microbes tested in field conditions. In this study, we investigated the response of rice plants to inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) under screenhouse and field conditions in two consecutive seasons in Senegal. Evaluation of single and mixed inoculations with AMF and PGPB was conducted on rice (Oryza sativa) variety Sahel 202, on sterile soil under screenhouse conditions. We observed that inoculated plants, especially plants treated with AMF, grew taller, matured earlier and had higher grain yield than the non-inoculated plants. Mixed inoculation trials with two AMF strains were then conducted under irrigated field conditions with four O. sativa varieties, two O. glaberrima varieties and two interspecific NERICA varieties, belonging to 3 ecotypes (upland, irrigated, and rainfed lowland). We observed that the upland varieties had the best responses to inoculation, especially with regards to grain yield, harvest index and spikelet fertility. These results show the potential of using AMF to improve rice production with less chemical fertilizers and present new opportunities for the genetic improvement in rice to transfer the ability of forming beneficial rice-microbe associations into high yielding varieties in order to increase further rice yield potentials.","Diedhiou, AG; Mbaye, FK; Mbodj, D; Faye, MN; Pignoly, S; Ndoye, I; Djaman, K; Gaye, S; Kane, A; Laplaze, L; Manneh, B; Champion, A",PLOS ONE,2016,10.1371/journal.pone.0167014,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.888121564159537,TRUE,2,6,Low,sterile,sterile; observed; investigated; tested,"inoculations with AMF and PGPB was conducted on rice (Oryza sativa) variety Sahel 202, on sterile soil under screenhouse conditions.

8828,GRAZING INTENSITY AFFECTS COMMUNITIES OF CULTURABLE ROOT-ASSOCIATED FUNGI IN A SEMIARID GRASSLAND OF NORTHWEST CHINA,"Intensive grazing by large herbivores is known to result in the degeneration of grassland worldwide. However, little is known about how grazing affects the fungi living in roots, especially those with septate hyphae. We investigated grazing intensity effects on culturable root-associated fungi (c-RAF) of three dominant plant species; Artemisia capillaris, Lespedeza davurica, and Stipa bungeana, in a semiarid grassland of northwest China. Plant roots were sampled from four grazing intensities at four sampling dates. The total colonization rate of c-RAF was not affected by grazing intensity, but the diversity of c-RAF displayed a hump-shaped trend with grazing intensities. Few c-RAF were present in all plant species, with most of them being confined to only one or two plant species. The 16 most commonly isolated species were selected to investigate their effects on plant growth and health. Three Fusarium species were most pathogenic c-RAF. Three dark-sterile species did not affect growth parameters, regardless of host plants. With A. capillaris, the occurrence of Fusarium spp. was highest in the control plots, while with S. bungeana, the occurrence tended to increase as the grazing intensity increased. Two dark-sterile species, including Darksidea alpha, in L. davurica roots increased with grazing intensities; in contrast, D. alpha decreased for S. bungeana with grazing intensities. Our results strongly suggest that in grasslands, grazing intensity can lead to changes in the colonization of specific root fungal taxa, and these fungal changes would potentially feed back to plant performance depending on the abundance of host plants.

12124,The frequency of modification of Dothistroma pine needle blight severity by fungi within the native range,"Foliar disease is most often understood as the product of the interaction between host and pathogen in an abiotically conducive environment. However, other microbes within the foliar microbiome may increase or decrease disease severity as either pathogen enablers or antagonists. The frequency and extent of such disease modification in nature are largely unknown, but modification is likely to occur at high frequency in the native range of a pathogen. In this study, we provided an opportunity for six fungi to modify the severity of Dothistroma needle blight in Pinus ponderosa within part of the native range of the disease near Priest River, Idaho, USA. Five fungi were common members of the P. ponderosa microbiome in the region, and one was isolated from co-occurring Pseudotsuga menziesii. Inoculum of each of the six was applied to an average of 187 newly emerging needles in the candles (new shoots) of each of ten, seven-year-old trees; control candles were treated with sterile distilled water. Disease severity per needle (i.e., lesion length/total needle length) was determined one year later following natural infection and development of Dothistroma needle blight in a total of 13,085 needles. Five of the six fungi significantly modified disease severity; the overall model (""inoculant"", ""tree"", and ""inoculant x tree"" as predictors) explained 53% of the variation in disease severity. Penicillium goetzii was the sole antagonist and reduced disease severity by nearly 7% compared to control needles. Four of the fungi (Sydowia polyspora, Bionectria ochroleuca, Penicillium raistrickii, and a culturable species of Elytroderma) acted as pathogen enablers, increasing disease severity 4.7%, 4.2%, 3.6%, and 2.5%, respectively. Our results show that microbial modification of expression of Dothistroma needle blight in nature may be common within the native range of the pathogen. However, with more thorough sampling of the P. ponderosa microbiome, the extent of modification may go beyond the modest effects reported here for just a few members of the microbiome of the host and its forest community.

Twenty-eight fungal endophytes were isolated from agarwood by strict sterile sample preparation and were classified into 14 genera and 4 taxonomic classes (Sordariomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Saccharomycetes, and Zygomycetes) based on molecular identification. Of the 28 isolates, 13 (46.4%) showed antimicrobial activity against at least one of the test strains by the agar well diffusion method, and 23 isolates (82.1%) displayed antitumor activity against at least one of five cancer cell lines by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The diameters of inhibition zones of YNAS07, YNAS14, HNAS04, HNAS05, HNAS08, and HNAS11 were equal to or higher than 14.0 mm against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, B. subtilis, Aspergillus fumigatus, and B. subtilis, respectively. The inhibition rates of YNAS06, YNAS08, and HNAS06 were not less than 60% to 293-T, 293-T, and SKVO3 cells, respectively.

2596,Infection Rates and Alkaloid Patterns of Different Grass Species with Systemic Epichloe Endophytes,"Symbiotic Epichloe species are fungal endophytes of cool-season grasses that can produce alkaloids with toxicity to vertebrates and/or invertebrates. Monitoring infections and presence of alkaloids in grasses infected with Epichloe species can provide an estimate of possible intoxication risks for livestock. We sampled 3,046 individuals of 13 different grass species in three regions on 150 study sites in Germany. We determined infection rates and used PCR to identify Epichloe species diversity based on the presence of different alkaloid biosynthesis genes, then confirmed the possible chemotypes with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) measurements. Infections of Epichloe spp. were found in Festuca pratensis Huds. (81%), Festuca ovina L. aggregate (agg.) (73%), Lolium perenne L. (15%), Festuca rubra L. (15%) and Dactylis glomerata L. (8%). The other eight grass species did not appear to be infected. For the majority of Epichloe-infected L. perenne samples (98%), the alkaloids lolitrem B and peramine were present, but ergovaline was not detected, which was consistent with the genetic evaluation, as dmaW, the gene encoding the first step of the ergot alkaloid biosynthesis pathway, was absent. Epichloe uncinata in F. pratensis produced anti-insect loline compounds. The Epichloe spp. observed in the F. ovina agg. samples showed the greatest level of diversity, and different intermediates of the indolediterpene pathway could be detected. Epichloe infection rates alone are insufficient to estimate intoxication risks for livestock, as other factors, like the ability of the endophyte to produce the alkaloids, also need to be assessed. IMPORTANCE Severe problems of livestock intoxication from Epichloe-infected forage grasses have been reported from New Zealand, Australia, and the United States, but much less frequently from Europe, and particularly not from Germany. Nevertheless, it is important to monitor infection rates and alkaloids of grasses with Epichloe fungi to estimate possible intoxication risks. Most studies focus on agricultural grass species like Lolium perenne and Festuca arundinacea, but other cool-season grass species can also be infected. We show that in Germany, infection rates and alkaloids differ between grass species and that some of the alkaloids can be toxic to livestock. Changes in grassland management due to changing climate, especially with a shift toward grasslands dominated with Epichloe-infected species such as Lolium perenne, may result in greater numbers of intoxicated livestock in the near future. We therefore suggest regular monitoring of grass species for infections and alkaloids and call for maintaining heterogenous grasslands for livestock.","Vikuk, V; Young, CA; Lee, ST; Nagabhyru, P; Krischke, M; Mueller, MJ; Krauss, J",APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,2019,10.1128/AEM.00465-19,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.984589236971116,TRUE,2,6,Low,not detected,pcr; observed; assessed; sampled,NA,"in three regions on 150 study sites in Germany.

1014,"Ectomycorrhizal fungal communities in Nothofagus nervosa (Rauli): A comparison between domesticated and naturally established specimens in a native forest of Patagonia, Argentina","Due to its overexploitation during the past century, Nothofagus nervosa is currently included in conservation and domestication programs, in which ectomycorrhizas play an important role. We aimed to describe the abundance and diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcMF) in both domesticated and naturally established N. nervosa specimens, and to analyse the influence of age, seasonality and forest management on EcMF communities. The occurrence of arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) was also investigated. Fungal diversity and taxonomic identification were assessed by morphotyping and subsequent ITS-rDNA sequencing. Plant age, seasonality and forest management influenced EcMF communities. Colonization rates were higher than 90 % in all the specimens, and were significantly higher in mature trees and in autumn. The highest EcMF richness and diversity values were registered in domesticated specimens and in autumn. Most EcMF were basidiomycetes, belonging mainly to the Cortinariaceae and Tricholomataceae. Arbuscular mycorrhizas were not detected, while DSE were present within N. nervosa roots. Our results and previously published reports showed that some EcMF are capable of colonizing different Nothofagus species. In addition, the EcMF described in natural ecosystems are different from those colonizing N. nervosa during its cultivation in the nursery. These results improve our understanding of key factors affecting EcMF communities associated with Nothofagus in native forests and nurseries (age, season, forest management, cultivation techniques), and this information is relevant for improving domestication programs.

3337,Dynamic Changes in the Microbiome of Rice During Shoot and Root Growth Derived From Seeds,"Microbes form close associations with host plants including rice as both surface (epiphytes) and internal (endophytes) inhabitants. Yet despite rice being one of the most important cereal crops agriculturally and economically, knowledge of its microbiome, particularly core inhabitants and any functional properties bestowed is limited. In this study, the microbiome in rice seedlings derived directly from seeds was identified, characterized and compared to the microbiome of the seed. Rice seeds were sourced from two different locations in Arkansas, USA of two different rice genotypes (Katy, M202) from two different harvest years (2013, 2014). Seeds were planted in sterile media and bacterial as well as fungal communities were identified through 16S and ITS sequencing, respectively, for four seedling compartments (root surface, root endosphere, shoot surface, shoot endosphere). Overall, 966 bacterial and 280 fungal ASVs were found in seedlings. Greater abundance and diversity were detected for the microbiome associated with roots compared to shoots and with more epiphytes than endophytes. The seedling compartments were the driving factor for microbial community composition rather than other factors such as rice genotype, location and harvest year. Comparison with datasets from seeds revealed that 91 (out of 296) bacterial and 11 (out of 341) fungal ASVs were shared with seedlings with the majority being retained within root tissues.

18323,Wheat endophytic lactobacilli drive the microbial and biochemical features of sourdoughs.,"The aim of this study was to assess whether wheat endophytic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are able to dominate in sourdough ecosystem. To do that, a first experimental phase considered doughs produced under semi-sterile conditions and singly inoculated with different strains of endophytic LAB and Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis A4 isolated from sourdough. Notwithstanding the high frequency of Lactobacillus plantarum in the sourdoughs prepared in laboratory, only one of the starter strains, L. plantarum LB2, was detected after five days of back-slopping. Subsequently, the ability of this strain to dominate traditional sourdoughs was evaluated at bakery and laboratory level. Contamination of sourdoughs with L. plantarum LB2 caused an increased number of LAB and, accordingly, higher acidification, compared to the sourdoughs before this event. After six days of propagation, the wheat endophytic strain L. plantarum LB2 was retrieved as a component of the bacterial population, in all the sourdoughs and regardless of the place of propagation.

A selection of eighteen actinobacteria inhabiting A. herba-alba were compared with twenty and ten actinobatceria isolates from the surrounding desert and groundwater, respectively, representing six genera. Antagonistic and enzymatic activities, plant growth-promoting traits, and the occurrence of biosynthetic genes were compared among the isolates. Data were analyzed statistically using principal component analysis (PCA) and were visualized using heat map. Endophytic strains showed higher antimicrobial activity and production of plant growth promoters compared to desert and groundwater strains.

20095,Correlation of morphological changes in mammotrophs with reductions in serum and tissue prolactin following exposure of rats to Kentucky-31 endophyte-infected seed extract,"To provide a mechanism for the reduced serum prolactin (PRL) concentration associated with fescue toxicity, th bs study examined changes in, ultrastructure and immunocytochemistry of pituitary mammotrophs following treatment with fescue extract. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed subcutaneously every 12 hours with either Kentucky-31 endophyte-infected seed extract (KEISE-4.86 gram seed equivalents/ml) or physiological sterile saline (PSS) from day 16 of gestation through day 4 postpartum. The level of hypophyseal immunoreactive PRL was indirectly estimated by microspectrophotometric quantitation of the absorbance of transmitted light. Light absorbed by hypophyseal tissue from KEISE-treated rats was 40.5% less (p<.05) than that of PSS-treated controls suggesting the hypophyseal glands of KEISE-treated animals were synthesizing a smaller amount of PRL. Serum PRL was directly quantitated by radioimmunoassay. The KEISE-treated dams did not show a significant rise in serum PRL, which is known to occur following parturition. Furthermore, the PRL levels in these KEISE-treated dams were reduced (p <.05) from baseline (day 16) at all time points measured. In contrast, serum PRL levels in the control rats increased (p <.05) after parturition and remained greater (p <.0003) than the PRL levels in KEISE-treated post-parturient dams. Electron micrographs showed swollen, disrupted and reduced numbers of organelles in the cytoplasm of mammotrophs from KEISE-treated animals compared with mammotrophs from control animals. In contrast to control cells, the mammotrophs that were exposed to KEISE contained fewer mature and immature secretory granules, and the large granules were not near the plasma membrane. Moreover, mammary alveolar cell secretory organelles were markedly disrupted in KEISE-exposed postpartum rats suggesting that the PRL-releasing machinery also may have been altered. Since mammary development and milk production are influenced by PRL in, rats, the results of this study indicate that KEISE may alter the amount of milk available to pups by diminishing maternal PRL synthesis and release.","Manning, WS; Garner, GB",TOXIC SUBSTANCE MECHANISMS,1998,NA,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.956299237591179,TRUE,2,5,Low,sterile,sterile; examined; examined,every 12 hours with either Kentucky-31 endophyte-infected seed extract (KEISE-4.86 gram seed equivalents/ml) or physiological sterile saline (PSS) from day 16 of gestation through day 4 postpartum.

7096,Endophytic fungi from the roots of horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) and their interactions with the defensive metabolites of the glucosinolate - myrosinase - isothiocyanate system,"Background: The health of plants is heavily influenced by the intensively researched plant microbiome. The microbiome has to cope with the plant's defensive secondary metabolites to survive and develop, but studies that describe this interaction are rare. In the current study, we describe interactions of endophytic fungi with a widely researched chemical defense system, the glucosinolate - myrosinase - isothiocyanate system. The antifungal isothiocyanates are also of special interest because of their beneficial effects on human consumers. Results: Seven endophytic fungi were isolated from horseradish roots (Armoracia rusticana), from the genera Fusarium, Macrophomina, Setophoma, Paraphoma and Oidiodendron. LC-ESI-MS analysis of the horseradish extract incubated with these fungi showed that six of seven strains could decompose different classes of glucosinolates. Aliphatic, aromatic, thiomethylalkyl and indolic glucosinolates were decomposed by different strains at different rates. SPME-GC-MS measurements showed that two strains released significant amounts of ally' isothiocyanate into the surrounding air, but ally' nitrile was not detected. The LC-ESI-MS analysis of many strains' media showed the presence of ally, isothiocyanate - glutathione conjugate during the decomposition of sinigrin. Four endophytic strains also accepted sinigrin as the sole carbon source. Isothiocyanates inhibited the growth of fungi at various concentrations, phenylethyl isothiocyanate was more potent than ally! isothiocyanate (mean IC50 was 2.30-fold lower). As a control group, ten soil fungi from the same soil were used. They decomposed glucosinolates with lower overall efficiency: six of ten strains had insignificant or weak activities and only three could use sinigrin as a carbon source. The soil fungi also showed lower AITC tolerance in the growth inhibition assay: the median IC50 values were 0.1925 mM for endophytes and 0.0899 mM for soil fungi. Conclusions: The host's glucosinolates can be used by the tested endophytic fungi as nutrients or to gain competitive advantage over less tolerant species. These activities were much less apparent among the soil fungi. This suggests that the endophytes show adaptation to the host plant's secondary metabolites and that host metabolite specific activities are enriched in the root microbiome. The results present background mechanisms enabling an understanding of how plants shape their microbiome.","Szucs, Z; Plaszkó, T; Cziáky, Z; Kiss-Szikszai, A; Emri, T; Bertóti, R; Sinka, LT; Vasas, G; Gonda, S",BMC PLANT BIOLOGY,2018,10.1186/s12870-018-1295-4,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.972628899807614,TRUE,2,5,Low,not detected,isolated; incubated; tested,NA,"special interest because of their beneficial effects on human consumers.

This issue demands for an effective phytoremediation technology. In this study we report the beneficial interactions of Clitoria ternatea and its plant growth promoting endophytic bacteria Bacillus cereus ERBP by inoculating it for the remediation of 5 ppm airborne ethylbenzene (EB). The percentage efficiency for ethylbenzene removal among B. cereus ERBP inoculated and non-inoculated sterile and natural C. ternatea has also been determined. The inoculation of B. cereus ERBP has significantly increased EB removal efficiency of both sterile and natural C. ternatea. The inoculated natural C. ternatea seedlings showed 100% removal efficiency within 84 h for the aforementioned pollutant compared with the sterile inoculated C. ternatea seedlings (108 h). The degradation of EB by C. ternatea seedlings with and without B. cereus ERBP was assessed by measuring the intermediates of EB including 1-phenylethanol, acetophenon, benzaldehyde and benzoic acid. In addition, cytochrome P450s monooxygenase (CYP83D1) and dehydrogenases (LOC100783159) involved in the oxidation of hydrocarbons are well reported for their bio catalytic activities under xenobiotic stress conditions.

4242,Control of fungal decay of apples and peaches by the biofumigant fungus Muscodor albus,"The potential of the volatile-producing fungus Muscodor albus for controlling postharvest diseases of fresh fruit by biological fumigation was investigated. In vitro tests showed that M. albus volatiles inhibited and killed a wide range of storage pathogens belonging to species of Botrytis, Colletotrichum, Geotrichum, Monilinia, Penicillium and Rhizopus. Fumigation of apples for 7 days with culture of M. albus grown on autoclaved grain gave complete control of blue mold (Penicillium expansum) and gray mold (Botrytis cinerea) in wound-inoculated fruits. There was no direct contact between the fruit and the M. albus culture. Shorter fumigation times ranging between 24 and 72 h, applied immediately or 24 h after inoculation, also controlled blue mold and gray mold. In wound-inoculated peaches, 24-72 h fumigation with M. albus provided complete control of brown rot (Monulinia fructicola). The volatile profile of M. albus-colonized grain was measured by gas chromatograph connected to a flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and showed that 2-methyl-1-butanol and isobutyric acid were the major volatile compounds found in the headspace.

Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) hold promising prospects towards sustainable and environmentally-friendly agriculture. Using habitat-adapted symbiosis strategy, the PGPR Pantoea agglomerans strain Pa was recovered from wheat roots sampled in Bou-Saâda, conferred alleviation of salt stress in durum wheat plants and allowed considerable growth in this unhostile environment. Strain Pa showed growth up to 35 °C temperature, 5-10 pH range, and up to 30% polyethylene glycol (PEG), as well as 1 M salt concentration tolerance. Pa strain displayed pertinent plant growth promotion (PGP) features (direct and indirect) such as hormone auxin biosynthesis, production of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, and ammonia and phosphate solubilization. PGPR features were stable over wide salt concentrations (0-400 mM). Pa strain was also able to survive in seeds, in the non-sterile and sterile wheat rhizosphere, and was shown to have an endophytic life style. Phylogenomic analysis of strain Pa indicated that Pantoea genus suffers taxonomic imprecision which blurs species delimitation and may have impacted their practical use as biofertilizers. When applied to plants, strain Pa promoted considerable growth of wheat seedlings, high chlorophyll content, lower accumulation of proline, and favored K+ accumulation in the inoculated plants when compared to Na+ in control non-inoculated plants. Metabolomic profiling of strain Pa under one strain many compounds (OSMAC) conditions revealed a wide diversity of secondary metabolites (SM) with interesting salt stress alleviation and PGP activities.

11897,Vertical transmission of fungal endophytes is widespread in forbs,"To date, it has been thought that endophytic fungi in forbs infect the leaves of their hosts most commonly by air-borne spores (termed ""horizontal transmission""). Here, we show that vertical transmission from mother plant to offspring, via seeds, occurs in six forb species (Centaurea cyanus, C. nigra, Papaver rhoeas, Plantago lanceolata, Rumex acetosa, and Senecio vulgaris), suggesting that this may be a widespread phenomenon. Mature seeds were collected from field-grown plants and endophytes isolated from these, and from subsequent cotyledons and true leaves of seedlings, grown in sterile conditions. Most seeds contain one species of fungus, although the identity of the endophyte differs between plant species. Strong evidence for vertical transmission was found for two endophyte species, Alternaria alternata and Cladosporium sphaerospermum. These fungi were recovered from within seeds, cotyledons, and true leaves, although the plant species they were associated with differed. Vertical transmission appears to be an imperfect process, and germination seems to present a bottleneck for fungal growth. We also found that A. alternata and C. sphaerospermum occur on, and within pollen grains, showing that endophyte transmission can be both within and between plant generations. Fungal growth with the pollen tube is likely to be the way in which endophytes enter the developing seed. The fact that true vertical transmission seems common suggests a more mutualistic association between these fungi and their hosts than has previously been thought, and possession of endophytes by seedling plants could have far-reaching ecological consequences. Seedlings may have different growth rates and be better protected against herbivores and pathogens, dependent on the fungi that were present in the mother plant. This would represent a novel case of trans-generational resistance in plants.","Hodgson, S; de Cates, C; Hodgson, J; Morley, NJ; Sutton, BC; Gange, AC",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2014,10.1002/ece3.953,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.839321854994929,TRUE,2,5,Low,sterile,isolated; sterile; collected,"endophytes isolated from these, and from subsequent cotyledons and true leaves of seedlings, grown in sterile conditions.

3735,Effect of inoculation method and plant growth medium on endophytic colonization of sorghum by the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana,"A study was conducted to determine the effect of inoculation method and plant growth medium on colonization of sorghum by an endophytic Beauveria bassiana. Colonization of leaves, stems, and roots by B. bassiana was assessed 20-days after application of the fungus. Although B. bassiana established as an endophyte in sorghum leaves, stems, and roots regardless of inoculation method (leaf, seed, or soil inoculation), plant growth medium (sterile soil, non-sterile soil, or vermiculite) apparently influenced colonization rates. Seed inoculation with conidia caused no stem or leaf colonization by the fungus in non-sterile soil but did result in substantial endophytic colonization in vermiculite and sterile soil. Leaf inoculation did not result in root colonization, regardless of plant growth medium. Endophytic colonization was greater in leaves and stems than roots. Endophytic colonization by B. bassiana had no adverse effects on the growth of sorghum plants. Leaf inoculation with a conidial suspension proved to be the best method to introduce B. bassiana into sorghum leaves for plants growing in either sterile or non-sterile soil.

Identification of fungal isolates was performed according to morphology by means of conventional mycological methods. Molecular identification was used for isolates not sporulating on culture media or those impossible to identify by morphological characters. The endophytic community was dominated by Phomopsis spp., Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Diaporthe phaseolorum. Molecular analysis revealed that sterile isolates corresponded to Xylaria acuta, Xylaria digitata, Xylaria venosula and Xylaria sp. Bark and fruit tissues showed the highest number of species. The mycobiota of vegetative and reproductive organs differed, having in common only 15 % of the taxa. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Pestalotiopsis guepinii were dominant in fruits and Diaporthe phaseolorum in twigs. The highest diversity of species was found in fruits and in leaf blades and the lowest in petioles. The tissue segments infected in neotropical Myrtaceae studied in Uruguay are similar to those found in temperate trees.

To investigate how P. indica improves freezing tolerance, we compared the expression profiles of P. indica-colonized and uncolonized Arabidopsis seedlings either exposed to freezing stress or not. Nearly 24 million (93.5%) reads were aligned on the Arabidopsis genome. 634 genes were differentially expressed between colonized and uncolonized Arabidopsis exposed to freezing stress. Interestingly, 193 Arabidopsis genes did not respond to freezing stress but were up-regulated by P. indica under freezing stress. Freezing stress-responsive genes encoded various members of the WRKY, ERF, bHLH, HSF, MYB and NAC transcription factor families. The qRT-PCR analyses confirmed the high-throughput sequencing results for 28 genes. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the fungus mainly controls genes for freezing-stress related proteins involved in lipid and ion transport, metabolism pathways and phytohormone signaling.

15611,"Root Endophytic Nectria haematococca Influences Growth, Root Architecture and Phosphorus Content of Green Gram in Different Substrates","Plant roots are colonized by a wide range of endophytic fungi. But the role of these fungi on plant growth and health is limited. Therefore, we studied the influence of an endophytic fungus Nectria haematococca isolated from roots of Chrysanthemum indicum on growth, root architecture and phosphorus (P) content in green gram in sterile soil and vermiculite. Inoculation of different concentrations (0, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 g kg−1) of carrier-based fungus inoculum improved green gram growth parameters like plant height, leaf numbers and biomass. Root architecture including specific root lengths, number and diameter of roots in different orders and root hair abundance and length were also significantly influenced by the fungus inoculation. The P content of plants inoculated with N. haematococca was significantly higher than the uninoculated plants. The fungus-mediated growth, root architecture and P content were better in vermiculite than in soil and when inoculated with 2 g kg−1 of the fungus inoculum. From the results, it could be concluded that the isolate of N. haematococca could be used as a bioinoculant to improve plant growth and productivity in soilless systems. © 2021, The National Academy of Sciences, India.",Muthukumar T.; Sulaiman M.R.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences India Section B - Biological Sciences,2021,10.1007/s40011-020-01195-x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.857387902361214,TRUE,2,5,Low,sterile,isolated; sterile; studied,"of Chrysanthemum indicum on growth, root architecture and phosphorus (P) content in green gram in sterile soil and vermiculite.

13845,Podocarp-type mycorrhizal nodules in Aesculus indica,"Morphological studies of Aesculus indica Colebr. root nodules were made. The development structure and regeneration of these nodules were found to be similar to those of conifers and different from those of legumes and other non-leguminous root-nodule bearing plants.The cellular configuration of a nodule and a lateral root is different although both of them arise endogenously. The nodule lacks an apical meristem, a root cap, and an open-ended endodermis. Instead the nodule is a fully differentiated structure with an endodermis overarching its vascular strand. The nodules are not modified or arrested lateral roots but they are the morphological features of the root system of A. indica.In nature the nodules as well as the lateral roots are occupied by a typical vesicular-arbuscular endophyte-Endogone. Vesicles were found in compact clusters intracellularly and are echinulated. The Aesculus forest soil contained 'yellow vacuolate non-endosporic' and 'bulbous reticulate' type of Endogone spores.The cause of nodulation was studied by planting the cuttings of A. indica in autoclaved sand. Nodulated adventitious roots arose from the bases of the cuttings. The nodules were endophytefree but the sand in which cuttings were growing was no longer bacteriologically sterile at the time of harvesting the nodules. Thus the nodules develop without any fungal stimulus. Typical Endogone infection was synthesized when Endogone spores extracted from Aesculus forest soil were added to the autoclaved sand.The taxonomy of non-legume nodulated plants, including Aesculus, when based on the system of classification proposed by Takhtajan, shows them to be more closely related than earlier workers have concluded. Their contemporaneous distribution suggests that these genera are survivors of an era in which conditions were favourable for the development of symbiotic associations and the nodules are additional structures for the retention of the endophyte. © 1972 OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS.",Khan A.G.,Annals of Botany,1972,10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a084575,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.960813864723281,TRUE,2,5,Low,sterile,sterile; ITS; studied,nodules were endophytefree but the sand in which cuttings were growing was no longer bacteriologically sterile at the time of harvesting the nodules.

4566,GROWTH AND YIELD OF LENTIL AND WHEAT INOCULATED WITH 3 GLOMUS ISOLATES FROM SASKATCHEWAN SOILS,"The vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (VAMF) Glomus clarum (Nicol, and Schenck) isolate NT4, G. mosseae (Nicol, and Gerd.) Gerd. and Trappe isolate NT6 and G. versiforme (Karst.) Berch isolate NT7 coexist in wheat field soils in Saskatchewan. This study assessed the response of lentil (Lens esculenta L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to monospecific and mixed cultures of these VAMF isolates. Seedlings were inoculated with 100 spores of a VAMF isolate, or an equal mixture of spores of two isolates, and grown in a sterile soil mix in a growth chamber. Both crops responded differently to these different VAMF isolates. In the case of lentil, G, clarum NT4 was more effective than G. mosseae NT6 and G, versiforme NTT, and significantly increased (P<0.05) the shoot dry weight (43%) and grain yield (57%) compared with the uninoculated control. There was a significant positive correlation between the percentage of VAMF colonized roots and shoot dry weight (r=0.672***) and shoot phosphorus concentration (r=0.608***) of lentil. In the case of wheat, G. clarum NT4 had no effect on shoot dry weight, but produced significant (P<0.08) increases in grain yield (12%) and the phosphorus concentration of the shoot and grain. Although G, clarum NT4 and G, mosseae NT6 both produced similar levels of VAM colonization in wheat, the only response of wheat to isolate NT6 was an increase in plant height at harvest. The efficacy of G. clarum NT4 on both crops appeared to be related to its ability to produce more arbuscular colonization than G. mosseae NT6. Dual inoculation of seedlings with G, clarum NT4 and G. mosseae NT6 resulted in competition between these two isolates. This was evident from a comparison of plant shoot dry weight and grain yield, and VAMF spore production on the two crops inoculated either with isolate NT4 alone or in combination with NT6. G. mosseae NT6 reduced the efficacy of G. clarum NT4 by 16% when dual inoculated on lentil, but had no effect when the host was wheat. Based on spore production, it was found that G. clarum NT4 was more competitive than G. mosseae NT6 when dual inoculated on lentil or wheat. Isolate NT4 produced ca. 2000 and 500 spores/100 g substrate, respectively, in the lentil and wheat pots, which was approximately 2-3 times more spores than those produced by isolate NT6 with either crop. When the plants were dual inoculated, there was a 15-19% reduction in spore production by G. clarum NT4 and a 50-70% decrease in spore production by G. mosseae NT6. Our results show that G. clarum NT4 was more competitive and effective in its ability to colonize and increase the growth and yield of lentil and wheat than G. mosseae NT6 or G. versiforme Nn. The relative performance of isolate NT4 with different host plants suggests that this VAMF isolate exhibits a host preference for lentil.","TALUKDAR, NC; GERMIDA, JJ",MYCORRHIZA,1994,10.1007/BF00202347,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.930450563988578,TRUE,2,5,Low,sterile,sterile; ITS; assessed,"VAMF isolate, or an equal mixture of spores of two isolates, and grown in a sterile soil mix in a growth chamber.

7285,Non-systemic fungal endophytes in Festuca rubra plants infected by Epichloe festucae in subarctic habitats,"Epichloe festucae is an endophytic fungus that infects systemically the aerial tissues of the host grass Festuca rubra. This fungus is transmitted vertically from the mother plant to seeds. Hypothetically, the presence of E. festucae could affect the infection of a plant by other fungal species. This could occur if E. festucae metabolites produced in planta interfere negatively with other fungal infections; or alternatively, if the modulation of plant defenses by the endophyte favour further fungal infections. We have analyzed the presence of culturable non-systemic endophytes in plants of F. rubra infected (E+) and not infected (E-) by E. festucae in two subarctic habitats, meadows and riverbanks in Northern Finland. The observed non-systemic endophyte infection frequencies were similar among E+ and E- plants from riverbanks, and E+ plants from meadows. In contrast to these, the infection frequency was significantly lower in E- plants from meadows. This result suggests that the presence of E. festucae is not a main factor determining the presence of non-systemic endophytes in plants. Instead, plant genetic characteristics related to compatibility with E. festucae and other endophytes in the more stable meadow populations might play a role in these fungus-fungus-plant interactions. As a result of the survey, 18 different taxa of non-systemic endophytes were identified in plants of F. rubra. All were ascomycetes except for one basidiomycete. Three endophytic taxa could not be ascribed to a genus, but sequence data indicated that they were conspecific with other unidentified endophytes that have been isolated in cold biomes at different locations.","Zabalgogeazcoa, I; Gundel, PE; Helander, M; Saikkonen, K",FUNGAL DIVERSITY,2013,10.1007/s13225-013-0233-x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994659702338684,TRUE,2,5,Low,not infected,isolated; observed; analyzed,"analyzed the presence of culturable non-systemic endophytes in plants of F. rubra infected (E+) and not infected (E-) by E. festucae in two subarctic habitats, meadows and riverbanks in Northern Finland.

Present study involved characterizing metabolite(s) of non-pathogenic, endophytic Fusarium oxysporum designated ZzEF8 which was identified previously from Zingiber zerumbet rhizome to display antagonism towards Pythium myriotylum [62.2 +/- 2.58% percent of inhibition (PoI)], an oomycetous phytopathogen of significant economic concern. Efficacy of ZzEF8 in suppressing soft rot by P. myriotylum was further evaluated by planting ginger rhizomes primed with ZzEF8 conidial suspension (10(6) conidia/ ml) followed by transplanting the primed rhizome in sterile soil infested with P. myriotylum (10(3) zoospores/g soil). Batch fermentation followed by solvent extraction yielded a dark red solid (0.45 mg/ml) which after fractionation by silica column (500 x 30 mm) chromatography (100-200 mu) using chloroform: methanol (8:2) solvent yielded three fractions, F1-3. Validation of inhibitory activity of the fractions by disc diffusion assay identified F2 to exhibit absolute P. myriotylum growth inhibition (100%) while F1 and F3 showed 57.62% and 10.73% inhibition respectively. Further purification of F2 by silica column chromatography (300 x 10 mm) yielded three sub-fractions viz., F2a-c. Further LC/Q -TOF MS-analysis of the three sub-fractions identified F2a to contain umbelliferone (t(R) 6.93 min) as major metabolite. Batch fermentation under submerged conditions was thence optimized for optimal metabolite production. Evaluation of cytotoxicity of F2a and F2b fractions in HeLa cell lines revealed F2a to display cytotoxic effect with IC50 value of 57.9 mu g/ml.

Association of plants with beneficial soil microbes is one strategy for plant adaption to environmental stresses. In this study, rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants were colonized by the beneficial root-colonizing endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica (P. indica). We demonstrate that grain yield were higher in P. indica-colonized rice plants compared to the uncolonized plants grown in soil. Moreover, P. indica effect on improving water stress tolerance in rice and its physiological mechanism were investigated in a hydroponic culture system. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was applied to the culture solution to conduct the water stress condition. Water stress-induced leaf wilting and impairments in photosynthetic efficiency were diminished in P. indica-colonized plants. Furthermore, P. indica colonization promotes stomata closure and increases the leaf surface temperature under water stress. The malondialdehyde level (as an indicator for oxidative stress) was lower and the reduced to oxidized glutathione ratio was higher in P. indica-colonized and PEG-exposed rice plants compared to the uncolonized plants. Furthermore, the activities of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and glutathione reductase were up-regulated in inoculated rice seedlings under water stress. In conclusion, P. indica promotes rice performance under water stress by stomata closure and lower oxidative stress.","Tsai, HJ; Shao, KH; Chan, MT; Cheng, CP; Yeh, KW; Oelmüller, R; Wang, SJ",PLANT SIGNALING & BEHAVIOR,2020,10.1080/15592324.2020.1722447,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.960701140744246,TRUE,2,5,Low,uncolonized,culture; ITS; investigated,"We demonstrate that grain yield were higher in P. indica-colonized rice plants compared to the uncolonized plants grown in soil.

The colonization pattern was monitored via inoculation of DsRED fluorescent protein-expressing F. oryzae on rice roots. To investigate the resistance induced by F. oryzae, the leaves of control and F. oryzae-colonized plants were inoculated with pathogenic Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The results showed that foliar infection of control plants with Xoo resulted in serious blight lesions. The disease ranged at rank 7 and 9 which accounted for 43.33% and 34.67%, respectively. The disease index was up to 79.26. Upon infestation with F. oryzae, leaves were protected from Xoo infection as evidenced by reductions in lesion size and severity, only with a few hypersensitive spots. It was clear that 8% of F. oryzaecolonized plants was not infected by Xoo. A large proportion of F. oryzae-infected plants ranged at rank 1, accounting for 72%, while its disease index was reduced to 15.26. The biocontrol efficiency of F. oryzae against Xoo was up to 80.75%. F. oryzae-inoculated roots showed 5.26-fold greater superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in comparison with controls. Meanwhile, catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) activities were elevated by 12.08- and 10.53-fold after infestation with F. oryzae, respectively.

Leveraging beneficial microbes will enhance plant resistance to salinity with physiological adjustments. Here we investigated the efficacy of plant growth promoting fungus (Piriformospora indica) on optimizing growth and salt tolerance of SRWCs and bioenergy tree crops, using Paulownia elongata as an example. Following culture in sterile soil, the chlamydospore of P. indica were found in paulownia plants roots. We treated both inoculated and uninoculated plants with four salt concentrations (0.00%, 0.30%,0.50%, 0.70%) by soaking them in varying concentrations of NaCl solution every 7 days. After 30 days of treatment, we investigated various physiological parameters, i.e., biomass, infection rate, growth rate, photosynthetic parameters, antioxidant enzyme activity, and soluble sugar of paulownia plants. Our two-way ANOVA demonstrated that the interaction between salinity stress and P. indica inoculation significantly enhanced plant height growth rate, leaf net photosynthetic rate, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and soluble protein content in Paulownia seedlings. Inoculated plants exhibited improved salt tolerance due to the mitigating effect of symbiosis across a salinity gradient. Mortality in the P. indica-treated group was reduced by approximately 5.55%, 22.22%, and 27.77% under 0.30%, 0.50%, and 0.70% NaCl treatments. Our study is the first application of P. indica to enhance salinity tolerance in Paulownia, a short-rotation woody crop.

12063,First Report of Fungal Endophyte Communities and Non-Defensive Phytochemistry of Biocontrol-Inoculated Whitebark Pine Seedlings in a Restoration Planting,"Plant endosymbionts (endophytes) influence host plant health and express genotype-dependent ecological relationships with plant hosts. A fungal species intended to confer host plant resistance to a forest pathogen was used as inoculum to test for effects of inoculation on disease resistance, microbiomes, and phytochemistry of a threatened pine species planted in a restoration setting. Correlations of inoculation presence/absence, phytochemistry, spatial location of seedlings, maternal seed sources, and fungal endophytic communities in the foliage of six-year-old whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) seedlings were assessed five years after an experimental inoculation of seedlings with foliar endophytic fungi cultured from whitebark pine trees at Crater Lake National Park, including Paramyrothecium roridum. We hypothesized that P. roridum would modify host microbiomes in a manner that combats white pine blister rust disease. Our assessment of seedlings in the field five years after inoculation allowed us to consider whether inoculation stimulated long-lasting changes in microbiome communities and whether effects varied by seedling genetic family. Tests for effects of endophyte inoculation on disease resistance were inconclusive due to current low levels of rust infection observed at the field site. Foliar fungal endophyte richness and Shannon diversity varied with maternal seed sources. Isotopic stoichiometry and phytochemistry did not vary with seedling spatial proximity, inoculation treatment, or maternal seed family. However, endophyte community composition varied with both seedling spatial proximity and maternal seed sources. Endophytic communities did not vary with the inoculation treatment, and the hypothesized biocontrol was not detected in inoculated seedlings. We draw three conclusions from this work: (1) fungal microbiomes of whitebark pine seedlings across our study site did not vary with host phytochemical signatures of ecophysiological status, (2) the inoculation of P. albicaulis seedlings with a mixture of fungal endophytes did not lead to persistent systemic changes in seedling foliar microbiomes, and (3) in correspondence with other studies, our data suggest that maternal seed source and spatial patterns influence fungal endophyte community composition.","Moler, ERV; Reinhardt, K; Sniezko, RA; Aho, K",FORESTS,2022,10.3390/f13060824,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.980762920886936,TRUE,2,5,Low,not detected,cultured; observed; assessed,"sources.

5936,Endophytic Pseudomonas induces metabolic flux changes that enhance medicinal sesquiterpenoid accumulation in Atractylodes lancea,"The bacterial endophyte Pseudomonas fluorescens ALEB7B significantly enhances photosynthate accumulations in Atractylodes lancea. These carbohydrates are preferentially used by the host plant to synthesize secondary metabolites, rather than to increase plant biomass accumulation. Mechanisms underlying the allocation of endophyte-increased carbohydrate in different plant metabolic processes are largely unknown. We have studied how P. fluorescens ALEB7B enhances photosynthate accumulation and how bacterial elicitors regulate metabolic flux and increase medicinal sesquiterpenoid formation in A. lancea using the sterile tissue culture plantlets. P. fluorescens ALEB7B enhances plant photosynthate accumulation by synthesizing and secreting indole-3-acetic acid, which has been demonstrated using high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. The increased endogenous indole-3-acetic acid promotes plant root development and then assimilation. Increased carbohydrates provide the material basis for the formations of terpenoid hydrocarbon scaffolds, which has been proved using gas chromatography analysis. Further, protein and polysaccharide elicitors secreted by P. fluorescens ALEB7B have been separated and purified from the bacterial fermentation broth, which have been applied to A. lancea plantlets. Both elicitors can stimulate the conversions of terpenoid hydrocarbon scaffolds to oxygenous sesquiterpenoids, the active medicinal ingredients in A. lancea, by triggering the oxidative burst in planta. Moreover, this study separates an ABC transporter substrate-binding protein from protein elicitors secreted by P. fluorescens ALEB7B with an AKTA Prime Plus Purifier System and firstly shows that this protein is essential to induce oxygenous sesquiterpenoid accumulation in A. lancea. This study provides new perspectives for mechanisms of medicinal oxygenous terpenoid synthesis, which has important reference values to the cultivation of medicinal plants that have terpenoids as their active ingredients, such as Artemisia annua and Taxus chinensis.","Zhou, JY; Sun, K; Chen, F; Yuan, J; Li, X; Dai, CC",PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY,2018,10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.07.016,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.897748564083996,TRUE,2,5,Low,sterile,culture; sterile; studied,bacterial elicitors regulate metabolic flux and increase medicinal sesquiterpenoid formation in A. lancea using the sterile tissue culture plantlets.

12398,Dark Septate Endophytic Fungi Help Tomato to Acquire Nutrients from Ground Plant Material,"Dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungi are facultative biotrophs that associate with hundreds of plant species, contributing to their growth. These fungi may therefore aid in the search for sustainable agricultural practices. However, several ecological functions of DSE fungi need further clarification. The present study investigated the effects of DSE fungi inoculation on nutrient recovery efficiency, nutrient accumulation, and growth of tomato plants fertilized with organic and inorganic N sources. Two experiments were carried out under greenhouse conditions in a randomized blocks design, with five replicates of tomato seedlings grown in pots filled with non-sterile sandy soil. Tomato seedlings (cv. Santa Clara I-5300) inoculated with DSE fungi (isolates A101, A104, and A105) and without DSE fungi (control) were transplanted to pots filled with 12 kg of soil which had previously received finely ground plant material [Canavalia ensiformis (L.)] that was shoot enriched with 0.7 atom % N-15 (organic N source experiment) or ammonium sulfate-N-15 enriched with 1 atom % N-15 (mineral N source experiment). Growth indicators, nutrient content, amount of nitrogen (N) in the plant derived from ammonium sulfate-N-15 or C. ensiformis-N-15, and recovery efficiency of N-15, P, and K by plants were quantified 50 days after transplanting. The treatment inoculated with DSE fungi and supplied with an organic N source showed significantly higher recovery efficiency of N-15, P, and K. In addition, the N-15, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, and Zn content, plant height, leaf number, leaf area (only for the A104 inoculation), and shoot dry matter increased. In contrast, the only positive effects observed in the presence of an inorganic N source were fertilizer-K recovery efficiency, content of K, and leaf area when inoculated with the fungus A104.

Saprotrophs, endophytes and plant pathogens were also present, but Glomeromycota (arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) were not detected. Fungal root communities were generally most similar within sites. Fungal diversity was inversely correlated with winter dark zone temperatures and distance from the entrance.

4176,Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi Contribute to Phosphorous Uptake and Allocation Strategies of Solidago canadensis in a Phosphorous-Deficient Environment,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) can facilitate the uptake of limiting or inaccessible nutrients by plants. However, the importance of AMF for invasive plants under phosphorus (P) limitation is poorly well understood because of the presence of non-focal microorganisms, such as endophytes or rhizosphere bacteria. In this study, we investigated how an invasive clonal plant Solidago canadensis benefits from the AMF Glomus intraradices by using a completely sterile culturing system, which is composed of aseptic seedlings, a pure AMF strain, and a sterile growth environment. We found that the colonization rate, abundance, and spore production of AMF in the insoluble P treatment was more than twice as much as in the available P treatment. Plant above-ground growth was enhanced almost 50% by AMF in the insoluble P treatment. Importantly, AMF were able to facilitate P acquisition by the plant in insoluble P conditions, allowing plants to have lower investment into below-ground biomass and higher benefit/return for above-ground biomass. This study demonstrated the important contribution that AMF make to plants in phosphate-deficient environments eliminating interference from non-focal microorganisms. Our results also suggest that interaction with AMF could contribute to the invasiveness of clonal plant S. canadensis in a resource-deficient environment.","Qi, SS; Wang, JH; Wan, LY; Dai, ZC; Matos, DMD; Du, DL; Egan, S; Bonser, SP; Thomas, T; Moles, AT",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2022,10.3389/fpls.2022.831654,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.905703432451992,TRUE,2,5,Low,sterile,sterile; aseptic; investigated,"invasive clonal plant Solidago canadensis benefits from the AMF Glomus intraradices by using a completely sterile culturing system, which is composed of aseptic seedlings, a pure AMF strain, and a sterile","invasive clonal plant Solidago canadensis benefits from the AMF Glomus intraradices by using a completely sterile culturing system, which is composed of aseptic seedlings, a pure AMF strain, and a sterile | the AMF Glomus intraradices by using a completely sterile culturing system, which is composed of aseptic seedlings, a pure AMF strain, and a sterile growth environment.

Sterile H. cordata seedlings were cultivated in sterile or non-sterile soils and inoculated with the LPFs, followed by the plants' analysis. The in vitro antifungal activity of H. cordata rhizome crude extracts on LPF were determined. The effect of inoculation of sterile seedlings by LPFs on the concentrations of rhizome phenolics was evaluated. The rates of in vitro growth inhibition amongst LPFs were determined. The LPFs had a strong negative effect on H. cordata in sterile soil; microbiota in non-sterile soil eliminated such influence. There was an interactive inhibition among LPFs; the secondary metabolites also regulated their colonization in H. cordata rhizomes. LPFs changed the accumulation of phenolics in H. cordata. The results provide that colonization of LPFs in rhizomes was regulated by the colonizing microbiota of H. cordata, the secondary metabolites in the H. cordata rhizomes, and the mutual inhibition and competition between the different latent pathogens.","Ye, HT; Luo, SQ; Yang, ZN; Wang, YS; Ding, Q",POLISH JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY,2021,10.33073/pjm-2021-034,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985874202889396,TRUE,2,5,Low,sterile,isolated; sterile; evaluated,"reveal this mechanism and identified as Ilyonectria liriodendri, an unidentified fungal sp., and Penicillium citrinum.

5526,VESICULAR-ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZA IN SEMIARID PASTURES OF SOUTH-WEST QUEENSLAND AND THEIR EFFECT ON GROWTH-RESPONSES TO PHOSPHORUS FERTILIZERS BY GRASSES,"Field and controlled environment studies were undertaken to determine the seasonal variation in vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) propagules under different types of vegetation in the mulga (Acacia aneura) shrublands of south-western Queensland and how inoculation with VAM affects the growth and response to phosphorus fertilizers of several grasses common to this region. A most probable number (MPN) technique was used to estimate the number of viable VAM propagules under mulga shrubland and native pasture. There was a pronounced rise in MPN at a native pasture site from June to November, peaking at 1 propagule/g soil, before declining between November and May to non detectable concentrations. In the mulga shrubland site, MPN remained very low (less than 0.2 propagules/g soil) throughout the study. Pasture species in the field were screened for VAM infection in both winter and summer. Only three of the 14 species sampled were infected with VAM in winter (June) after a long drought. In contrast, 10 of the 14 species sampled in December possessed VAM-infected roots. A pot experiment was conducted to examine the influence of VAM inoculation on growth and the response to phosphate fertilizer of several important pasture grasses in pastures derived from mulga shrublands. The treatments comprised a factorial combination of inoculation or non-inoculation with VAM, four grass species (Aristida armata, Cenchrus ciliaris cv. USA, Digitaria ammophilla, and Thyridolepis mitchelliana), and four rates of P fertilizer designed to range over very deficient to non-limiting for each species. All species except D. ammophilla produced growth responses to VAM inoculation. Though C. ciliaris and T. mitchelliana responded to VAM inoculation only in soil unamended with P fertilizer, A. armata showed growth responses across all P rates examined, suggesting some factor other than P was limiting this species. The growth response of the grasses to VAM inoculation was poorly correlated with the percentage of root infected with VAM. D. ammophilla had the highest levels of root infection (32%) despite producing no growth response to VAM. In contrast, T. mitchelliana had less than 2% of the root infected with VAM. All species had thin fibrous roots with long (0.35-0.47 mm), frequent root hairs. The differential growth responses to VAM inoculation of A. armata compared with the other grasses may provide a management strategy to control Aristida ingress into pastures established from mulga shrublands.","ARMSTRONG, RD; HELYAR, KR; CHRISTIE, EK",AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,1992,10.1071/AR9921143,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.942804599469612,TRUE,2,5,Low,no growth,examined; examined; screened; sampled,"infected with VAM.

An aseptate fungus invaded the gametophyte tissue through the rhizoids. The fungus spread within the thickened midrib forming intracellular hyphal coils. The latter gave rise regularly to arbuscules which were cytoplasmic in the young part of the midrib. In the older midrib, arbuscules degenerated and vesicles occurred. With arbuscular development, host cytoplasm and cell organelles increased and starch disappeared from plastids. The fungus formed globose spores inside the rhizoids.

The effects of inoculation with Glomus manihotis on mycorrhizal infection and plant growth were assessed. Early growth and nodulation of P. phaseoloides in soil with and without rock phosphate fertilizer were also determined. In the legumes, mycorrhizal infection was high at all P levels and sources, except for a significant decrease of infection in S. capitata at high levels of superphosphate. Plant growth was significantly increased by phosphate fertilizer and mycorrhizal inoculation. Mycorrhizal responses were more pronounced at low P levels with both P sources. In B. dictyoneura mycorrhizal infection was decreased with increasing additions of P. No effects of mycorrhizal inoculation (except with no added P) were observed.

In this study, we identified several key events of the biological cycle of the fungus, in particular how it enters plant tissues. Study of seeds of partially choked heads ruled out the vertical transmission of E. typhina in D. glomerata. The fungal mycelium that had colonised the seeds appeared not to be viable: it: was not isolated from 360 seeds analysed that had 49% infection rate. Moreover, 280 seedlings and 488 young plants grown from these seeds were free from E. typhina. Ascospores, considered as propagules in horizontal transmission, were previously presumed to infect orchardgrass through cut stems at harvest or through stigmas of florets. E. typhina was not detected (by microscopic or histological analyses) in 332 cut stems that had been inoculated with ascospores. Our research indicates that ascospores (or conidia produced by ascospores) are more likely to infect young vegetative tillers.

6876,Endophytic fungus Colletotrichum sp. AP12 promotes growth physiology and andrographolide biosynthesis in Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Nees,"Endophytic fungi can promote host plant growth, enhance antioxidant defense enzyme activity, and induce the biosynthesis and accumulation of secondarymetabolites. Therefore, using endophytic fungi to improve the quality and yield of medicinal plants or important crops is an effective means of regulation. Colletotrichum sp. AP12 has been reported to produce andrographolide compounds (ADCs). This study aimed to investigate the effects of AP12 and its elicitors on the growth, defense enzyme activity, accumulation, and transcription levels of key genes in Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Nees (A. paniculata). Using fermentation method to prepare AP12 into the inactivated fermentation solution (IFS), fermentation solution (FS), inactivated mycelium solution (IMS), and mycelium solution (MS), and the results showed that all four fungal elicitor components (ECs) could promote A. paniculata growth, enhance antioxidant defense enzymes, and increase ADC content and yield, especially the IMS group that had the highest leaf area, whole plant dry weight, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) enzyme activities, total lactone contents, and yields, which were 2.37-, 1.60-, 2.20-, 3.27-, 1.59-, and 2.65-fold of the control, respectively. The 14-deoxyandrographolide (NAD) in the host irrigated with MS was 3.35-fold that of the control. In addition, AP12-infected A. paniculata sterile seedlings could significantly increase ADC content and expression levels of key enzyme genes, especially on day 12, when the total lactone content of the host reached 88.881 & PLUSMN; 5.793 mg/g DW, while on day 6, CPS gene expression level reached 10.79-fold that of the control, in turn promoting the biosynthesis and accumulation of andrographolide. In conclusion, the endophytic fungus AP12 is beneficial to the growth and secondary metabolism of A. paniculata, which is helpful for the cultivation and application of the biological bacterial fertilizer in A. paniculata, providing a theoretical and research basis for the use of endophytic fungi as a microbial resource to improve the quality and yield of medicinal plants.","Xu, D; Li, N; Gu, YQ; Huang, J; Hu, BS; Zheng, JY; Hu, JW; Du, Q",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2023,10.3389/fpls.2023.1166803,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.973996847751461,TRUE,2,4,Low,sterile,sterile; ITS,"host irrigated with MS was 3.35-fold that of the control.

16897,Black Root Rot Caused by Thielaviopsis basicola on Lettuce in California.,"In 2005 and 2006, field-grown iceberg lettuce (Lactuca sativa) in California's coastal Salinas Valley (Monterey County) was affected by a previously unreported disease. Symptoms were observed on iceberg lettuce at the post-thin rosette stage (8 to 12 leaves). Plants were stunted and slightly chlorotic. Fine feeder roots had numerous, small (4 to 8 mm long), elongated, dark brown-to-black lesions. Larger secondary roots and taproots lacked lesions. No vascular discoloration was present. Isolations from root lesions consistently resulted in gray fungal colonies that formed catenulate, cylindrical, thin-walled, hyaline endoconidia and catenulate, subrectangular, thick-walled, dark aleuriospores. The fungus was identified as Thielaviopsis basicola (2). Conidial suspensions (5.0 × 105) of eight isolates from iceberg lettuce were used for pathogenicity tests. Iceberg cv. Ponderosa and romaine cv. Winchester were grown for 3 weeks in soilless peat moss rooting mix. Roots of 20 plants per cultivar were washed free of the rooting mix and soaked in conidial suspensions for 5 min. Plants were repotted and grown in a greenhouse. Control plant roots were soaked in sterile distilled water (SDW). After 3 weeks, inoculated iceberg exhibited slight chlorosis in comparison with control plants. Feeder roots of all iceberg plants inoculated with the eight isolates exhibited numerous black lesions and T. basicola was reisolated from these roots. Romaine lettuce, however, did not show any foliar symptoms. Small segments of roots had tan-to-light brown discoloration and T. basicola was occasionally reisolated (approximately 40% recovery). Roots of control iceberg and romaine showed no symptoms. Results were similar when this experiment was repeated. To explore the host range of T. basicola recovered from lettuce, two isolates were prepared and inoculated as described above onto 12 plants each of the following: iceberg lettuce (cv. Ponderosa), bean (cv. Blue Lake), broccoli (cv. Patriot), carrot (cv. Long Imperator #58), celery (cv. Conquistador), cotton (cv. Phy-72 Acala), cucumber (cv. Marketmore 76), green bunching onion (cv. Evergreen Bunching), parsley (cv. Moss Curled), pepper (cv. California Wonder 300 TMR), radish (cv. Champion), spinach (cvs. Bolero and Bossanova), and tomato (cv. Beefsteak). Control plant roots of all cultivars were soaked in SDW. After 4 weeks, only lettuce and bean roots had extensive brown-to-black lesions, from which the pathogen was consistently resiolated. Roots of cotton, pepper, spinach, and tomato had sections of light brown-to-orange discoloration; the pathogen was not consistently recovered from these sections. All other species and the control plants were symptomless. This experiment was repeated with similar results except that inoculated peppers were distinctly stunted compared with control plants. To my knowledge, this is the first report of black root rot caused by T. basicola on lettuce in California. Disease was limited to patches along edges of iceberg lettuce fields; disease incidence in these discrete patches reached as high as 35%. Affected plants continued to grow but remained stunted in relation to unaffected plants and were not harvested. Black root rot of lettuce has been reported in Australia (1); that report also showed that lettuce cultivars vary in susceptibility to T. basicola and isolates from lettuce were highly aggressive on bean but not on many other reported hosts of this pathogen.

10630,Fungal endophytes reduce regrowth and affect competitiveness of meadow fescue in early succession of pastures,"Systemic- and seed-transmitted fungal endophytes are suggested to enhance competitive dominance of agronomic grasses by increasing plant growth and defence against herbivores. We studied whether Neotyphodium uncinatum endophyte infection frequencies of meadow fescue (Schedonorus pratensis) and botanical composition of pastures are affected by 4, 5, 7 and 21 years of grazing by dairy cattle. We then examined with one greenhouse and two field experiments, whether endophyte infection and clipping affect regrowth of young or mature plants relative to nutrient availability in soil. The frequencies of infected plants and the number of plant species were less in grazed parts of the pastures. Endophytes significantly reduced relative regrowth and dry biomass of regrowth of the grass irrespective of nutrient levels in a 1-year-old field (on an average 18% in 2 months) and under high nutrient conditions in the greenhouse experiment (on an average 3% in 3 months) respectively. However, effects of endophytes were not detected in 5-year-old fields and under low nutrient conditions in the greenhouse.

10291,Identification and genetic characterization of a new totivirus from Bursera graveolens in western Ecuador,"The complete genomic sequence of a previously uncharacterized virus provisionally named ""Bursera graveolens associated totivirus 1"" (BgTV-1) was obtained from Bursera graveolens (Kunth) Triana & Planch., a tree known as ""palo santo"" in Ecuador. The BgTV-1 genome is a monopartite double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that is 4794 nucleotides (nt) long (GenBank accession number ON988291). Phylogenetic analysis of the capsid protein (CP) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) placed BgTV-1 in a clade with other plant-associated totiviruses. Amino acid (aa) sequence comparisons of putative BgTV-1 proteins showed the highest sequence similarity to those of taro-associated totivirus L (QFS21890.1-QFS21891.1) and Panax notoginseng virus A (YP_009225664.1- YP_009225665.1), with 51.4% and 49.8% identity, respectively, in the CP and 56.4% and 55.2% identity, respectively, in the RdRp.

12390,Fungal pathogens and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi of abandoned agricultural fields: potential limits to restoration,"Little is known about impacts of soilborne pathogen legacies on reestablishment of native plant species in abandoned agricultural fields. We tested whether pathogens found in abandoned citrus orchards affect growth of native and invasive plant species in a controlled greenhouse experiment. In previous research, we identified several species of ascomycete (Fusarium spp.) and oomycete (Pythium spp.) pathogens from field roots and soils. The invasive annual grass, ripgut brome [Bromus diandrus (Roth.)], and native forbs, common fiddleneck [Amsinckia intermedia Fisch. & C.A. Mey.], coastal tidytips [Layia platyglossa (Fisch. & C.A. Mey.) A. Gray], and California goldfields [Lasthenia californica (DC. ex Lindl.)], were grown together in four different field soil treatments. Using pesticides on soils collected from abandoned citrus fields, we created four soil treatments that excluded different groups of potential pathogens: (1) untreated control (2) metalaxyl (oomyceticide) (3) fludioxonil (fungicide), and (4) steam-sterilized. Fludioxonil increased aboveground biomass of L. platyglossa (P = 0.005) and L. californica (P= 0.02) compared with sterile and metalaxyl-treated soils. Lasthenia californica had decreased arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization with metalaxyl, suggesting metalaxyl has non-target effects on mycorrhizae. Fludioxonil decreased potential pathogens in L. californica roots while having no effect on mycorrhizal colonization. Bromus diandrus had higher biomass in sterile and fludioxonil-treated soils than untreated soils (P = 0.0001), suggesting a release from soilborne pathogens. The release from soilborne pathogens with the use of fludioxonil in both native forbs and B. diandrus, combined with overall higher biomass across treatments in B. diandrus, suggests that pathogen impacts in a field setting are insufficient to reduce success of this invasive grass, and use of a fungicide would not benefit native species in mixed stands with B. diandrus.","Hilbig, BE; Allen, EB",INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT,2019,10.1017/inp.2019.19,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.939904734065508,TRUE,2,4,Low,sterile,sterile; collected; tested,"aboveground biomass of L. platyglossa (P = 0.005) and L. californica (P= 0.02) compared with sterile and metalaxyl-treated soils.

17125,Endophytic microbes Bacillus sp. LZR216-regulated root development is dependent on polar auxin transport in Arabidopsis seedlings.,"Endophytic microbes Bacillus sp. LZR216 isolated from Arabidopsis root promoted Arabidopsis seedlings growth. It may be achieved by promoting the lateral root growth and inhibiting the primary root elongation. Plant roots are colonized by an immense number of microbes, including epiphytic and endophytic microbes. It was found that they have the ability to promote plant growth and protect roots from biotic and abiotic stresses. But little is known about the mechanism of the endophytic microbes-regulated root development. We isolated and identified a Bacillus sp., named as LZR216, of endophytic bacteria from Arabidopsis root. By employing a sterile experimental system, we found that LZR216 promoted the Arabidopsis seedlings growth, which may be achieved by promoting the lateral root growth and inhibiting the primary root elongation. By testing the cell type-specific developmental markers, we demonstrated that Bacillus sp. LZR216 increases the DR5::GUS and DR5::GFP expression but decreases the CYCB1;1::GUS expression in Arabidopsis root tips. Further studies indicated that LZR216 is able to inhibit the meristematic length and decrease the cell division capability but has little effect on the quiescent center function of the root meristem. Subsequently, it was also shown that LZR216 has no significant effects on the primary root length of the pin2 and aux1-7 mutants. Furthermore, LZR216 down-regulates the levels of PIN1-GFP, PIN2-GFP, PIN3-GFP, and AUX1-YFP. In addition, the wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings in the present of 1 or 5 µM NPA (an auxin transport inhibitor) were insensitive to LZR216-inhibited primary root elongation. Collectively, LZR216 regulates the development of root system architecture depending on polar auxin transport.

Weather moorlands in the upland regions of the United Kingdom are under threat from changes in land use and management, the potential effects of atmospheric nitrogen deposition and climate warming. Displacement of heather (Calluna vulgaris) stands by bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) is also widespread. 2. Field (Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve) and laboratory studies were carried out to investigate decomposition rates of heather and bracken litters. The effects of fertilization with mineral N (50 kg ha(-1) year(-1) added in four increments) and temperature responses of microbial respiration in decomposing litters were determined. 3. The qualities of heather and bracken litters were similar with 1.5% N, 22.3% cellulose and 40.6% lignin in heather, and 1.32% N, 28.9% cellulose and 49.0% lignin in bracken. Total concentrations of phenylpropanoid derivatives (PPDs) from lignin (by alkaline CuO oxidation) and total hydrolysable carbohydrates (using TFA) were similar for the two litter types, but there were qualitative differences in the constituents of the lignins and hemicelluloses. 4. Bracken and heather litters in 1 mm mesh bags both lost about 34% of initial mass over 18 months but 1:1 mixtures of the two Litters showed 14% higher losses over the same period. These mixture effects could not be explained in terms of litter quality. Laboratory studies, on litter mixtures incubated on sterile sand and soil organic matter, suggested that the mechanisms involved interactions between components of litter microbial communities; possibly fungal endophytes. 5. The decomposition rates of heather and bracken Litters were about 10% higher in die N-fertilized plots than control plots while the mixtures showed nearly 15% higher mass losses, 6. Heather and bracken litters incubated in the laboratory with temperature cycles varying from 2 degrees C to 24 degrees C for heather and 2 degrees C to 27 degrees C, far bracken, showed rapid depletion of available carbohydrates over 2 months. Despite the changes in litter quality the temperature response coefficient (Q(10) congruent to 2.5) showed little change over this period. 7. It is concluded chat synergistic interactions between litter types, which may occur when bracken invades heather stands, can significantly increase surface litter decomposition rates and that N fertilization can further enhance mass losses. The extent to which these interactions affect litter standing crops, plant species interactions and organic matter dynamics in peaty upland soils, remains to be determined.","Anderson, JM; Hetherington, SL",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,1999,10.1046/j.1365-2435.1999.00014.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.942825912940122,TRUE,2,4,Low,sterile,incubated; sterile,"not be explained in terms of litter quality.

5433,Endophytic microorganisms as potential growth promoters of banana,"The potential of endophytic microorganisms in promoting the growth of their host plant was determined by artificially introducing five isolates (bacterial and fungal strains: UPM31F4, UPM31P1, UPM14B1, UPM13B8, UPM39B3) isolated from the roots of wild bananas into both healthy and diseased banana plantlets (Berangan cv. Intan). The response of the host plants to endophytic infection was assessed by measuring the change in four growth parameters: plant height, pseudostem diameter, root mass and total number of leaves. The endophytes tested as growth promoters were found to have a significant effect in both healthy and Fusarium-infected (diseased) plantlets. In both experimental systems, the bacterial isolate UPM39B3 (Serratia) and fungal isolate UPM31P1 (Fusarium oxysporum) showed promising growth-promoting properties. Isolate UPM39B3 (Serratia) induced the largest increases in all four growth parameters in healthy plantlets - 3.14 cm (height), 1.12 cm (pseudostem diameter), 2.12 g (root mass) and 1.12 (total number of leaves plant(-1)) - followed by isolate UPM31P1 (Fusarium oxysporum). The beneficial effect of UPM39B3 (Serratia) and UPM31P1 (Fusarium oxysporum) was also reflected in the diseased plantlets, where pre-treatments with the isolates either singly (T6: UPM31P1; T8: UPM39B3) or in a mixture (T7: UPM31P1 + UPM39B3; T9: UPM14B1 + UPM13B8 + UPM39B3) were able to sustain the growth of plantlets, with significantly higher growth values than those in diseased plantlets that were not infected with endophytes (T10: FocR4).

However, most studies have been of plants in humid environments, and there are few reports of the benefits of such associations for plants of extreme environments. Our aims were to identify endophytic fungi using morphological taxonomy, to explore richness and estimate species frequency in a cactus, C. jamacaru, in Brazilian tropical dry forest (Caatinga). We thus identified 59 taxa, corresponding to 69.7 % of the total number of isolates; the other 30.3 % were sterile mycelia. Cladosporium cladosporioides and Fusarium oxysporum were the species most commonly isolated, followed by Acremonium implicatum, Aureobasidium pullulans, Trichoderma viride, Chrysonilia sitophila, and Aspergillus flavus. Forty-seven species are recorded for the first time as endophytic fungi of cacti, and 18 others as endophytes for Brazil; this suggests that C. jamacaru harbors a highly diverse fungal community as measured by a diversity index. However, species accumulation curves suggest that our study still underestimates endophyte diversity because it does not provide an exhaustive sample.

7224,Muscodor tigerii sp nov.-Volatile antibiotic producing endophytic fungus from the Northeastern Himalayas,"Genus Muscodor came into existence with the discovery of Muscodor albus, a sterile endophytic fungus that produces a medley of volatile organic moieties possessing strong antimicrobial activity. The current paper reports Muscodor tigerii as a novel endophytic fungus from the stem internal tissue of Cinnamomum camphora growing in the Tiger Hill area of Darjeeling, West Bengal, India. M. tigerii exhibited distinct morphological, molecular and physiological features than previously reported Muscodor species. The fungus possesses all the morphological features described till date in genus Muscodor making it remarkably unique. The strong fruity smell of the fungus is attributed to 22 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), predominantly 4-Octadecylmorpholine, 1-Tetradecanamine,N,N-dimethyl and 1,2-Benzenedicarboxylic acid, mono(2-ethylhexyl) ester.

9207,Effect of seed treatment duration on growth and colonization of Vicia faba by endophytic Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium brunneum,"The effect of increased duration of seed treatment with two fungal entomopathogens, Beauveria bassiana (NATURALIS) and Metarhizium brunneum (BIPESCO5), on the growth and colonization of broad bean (Vicia faba) was assessed in two replicate greenhouse experiments. The plants were inoculated by soaking seeds in a concentration of 1 x 10(7) conidia ml(-1) of each of the two fungal strains or in sterile distilled water containing 0.1% Tween 80 for 2, 8, and 16 h. Percent seed germination and seedling emergence as well as primary root length were determined seven days post inoculation. Effects of fungal strain and seed treatment duration on plant height, number of leaf pair, fresh root and shoot weight were measured 14 and 28 days post inoculation. Seed treatment with either fungal strain significantly enhanced almost all measured plant growth parameters. Overall, plant growth was also significantly enhanced as seed treatment duration increased; irrespective of fungal strain. Percent colonization of different plant parts (root, leaf, and stem) sampled 14 and 28 days post inoculation increased as the duration of seed treatment increased as well. The increase in colonization rate due to increased seed treatment duration varied significantly among plant parts, but not among both sampling dates. Our study demonstrates that M. brunneum can systemically colonize different plant parts and improve plant growth when applied as a seed treatment. This was also confirmed for the well-known endophytic B. bassiana strain used in this study. Our results also provide the first report for the effect of increased duration of seed treatment with both endophytic fungal entomopathogens on plant growth enhancement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

1010,Sex in the PAC: A hidden affair in dark septate endophytes?,"Background: Fungi are asexually and sexually reproducing organisms that can combine the evolutionary advantages of the two reproductive modes. However, for many fungi the sexual cycle has never been observed in the field or in vitro and it remains unclear whether sexual reproduction is absent or cryptic. Nevertheless, there are indirect approaches to assess the occurrence of sex in a species, such as population studies, expression analysis of genes involved in mating processes and analysis of their selective constraints. The members of the Phialocephala fortinii s. l. - Acephala applanata species complex (PAC) are ascomycetes and the predominant dark septate endophytes that colonize woody plant roots. Despite their abundance in many ecosystems of the northern hemisphere, no sexual state has been identified to date and little is known about their reproductive biology, and how it shaped their evolutionary history and contributes to their ecological role in forest ecosystems. We therefore aimed at assessing the importance of sexual reproduction by indirect approaches that included molecular analyses of the mating type (MAT) genes involved in reproductive processes. Results: The study included 19 PAC species and > 3, 000 strains that represented populations from different hosts, continents and ecosystems. Whereas A. applanata had a homothallic (self-fertile) MAT locus structure, all other species were structurally heterothallic (self-sterile). Compatible mating types were observed to co-occur more frequently than expected by chance. Moreover, in > 80% of the populations a 1: 1 mating type ratio and gametic equilibrium were found. MAT genes were shown to evolve under strong purifying selection. Conclusions: The signature of sex was found in worldwide populations of PAC species and functionality of MAT genes is likely preserved by purifying selection. We hypothesize that cryptic sex regularely occurs in the PAC and that further field studies and in vitro crosses will lead to the discovery of the sexual state. Although structurally heterothallic species prevail, it cannot be excluded that homothallism represents the ancestral breeding system in the PAC.","Zaffarano, PL; Queloz, V; Duò, A; Grünig, CR",BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,2011,10.1186/1471-2148-11-282,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.97272488177776,TRUE,2,4,Low,sterile,sterile; observed,NA,"of the two reproductive modes.

3044,Effects of Three Strawberry Entomopathogenic Fungi on the Prefeeding Behavior of the Aphid Myzus persicae,"Entomopathogenic fungi are essential participants in ecosystems that help regulate arthropod communities. Many of them have a symbiotic-endophytic relationship with plants, endowing them with insecticidal or insect-repellent traits, which could be exploited for insect control in agriculture. Among insects, aphids are one of the most harmful taxa; they damage plants directly by sucking plant sap or indirectly by transmitting economically important viruses. Plant infestation by aphids depends on prefeeding activities related to host identification, particularly leaf walking and short probing. Although several aspects of aphid prefeeding activities have been studied in different hosts, this behavior has not been examined on plants colonized by entomopathogenic fungi. Here, we studied the effects of three strawberry endophytic entomopathogenic fungi, namely, Beauveria bassiana, Isaria fumosorosea and Metarhizium anisopliae var. robertsii, on the prefeeding activity of the aphid Myzus persicae by monitoring aphids feeding on leaves of fungus colonized and uncolonized plants. Our analysis revealed that the endophytes significantly affected aphid prefeeding behavior, which was typified by a reduction of the expected mean number of short probes, an avoidance to make a second probe, and a high propensity for abandoning the leaf. We discuss possible mechanisms of fungal interference with aphid activity.","Manoussopoulos, Y; Mantzoukas, S; Lagogiannis, I; Goudoudaki, S; Kambouris, M",JOURNAL OF INSECT BEHAVIOR,2019,10.1007/s10905-019-09709-w,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.848683438911799,TRUE,2,4,Low,uncolonized,examined; examined; studied,"of the aphid Myzus persicae by monitoring aphids feeding on leaves of fungus colonized and uncolonized plants.

14699,Lobule shape evolution in Radula (Jungermanniopsida): One rate fits all?,"The quantification of lobule shape for Radula spp. shows that there is overlap in lobule shape space occupied by subgenera, such that lobule shape does not always reflect relationships. Morphological convergence caused by lineages repeatedly traversing shared regions of morphospace appears commonplace in Radula, and means that many pairs of relatively unrelated species have similar lobule shapes. When observed over time, as in comparisons between fossil and extant species, this may give the impression of stasis if fossil species resemble modern species by chance, independent of their relatedness. This poses a challenge to relating fossils of known age to extant lineages, particularly when fossils are sterile. Significant rate variation between lineages was identified by Adams' Q-mode analysis, with the fastest subgenus evolving 23 times more quickly than the slowest. Species of subgenus Volutoradula and subgenus Metaradula are apparently over-dispersed throughout lobule morphospace according to Sidlauskas' method; morphometric branch lengths and hypervolumes in other subgenera can be explained by a stochastic process. In contrast, Bayesian analysis of macroevolutionary mixtures (BAMM) identified a single evolutionary rate as having the highest posterior probability. Consideration of the three independent accessions into auriculate lobule morphospace by Cladoradula and Radula, wherein convergent lobule shapes result from convergent lobule ontogenies and are correlated with bipinnately branched shoot systems and robust primary stems, leads to an ontogenetic hypothesis driven by structural requirements for light interception, under which auriculate lobules are a spandrel. It is speculated that lobules themselves, however, may be a key innovation facilitating radiation into microsites devoid of or depauperate in fungal endophytes. © 2015 The Linnean Society of London.",Renner M.A.M.,Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society,2015,10.1111/boj.12279,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.974915888477858,TRUE,2,4,Low,sterile,sterile; observed,NA,"Radula, and means that many pairs of relatively unrelated species have similar lobule shapes.

1354,Occurrence of endophytes in grasses native to northern China,"A survey of grass species associated with Neotyphodium and Epichloe fungal endophytes was made in the permanent grasslands of northern China. A total of 41 grass species, 56 sites and 172 local populations were examined to reveal endophytic infection of native grasses. Twenty-five of the forty-one species of grasses (proportionately 0.61) were infected by endophytes: twenty-two species had a mean infection rate of 0.01-0.50 and only three species had a mean infection > 0.50. Of the 172 local populations examined, however, proportionately 0.72 were not infected, 0.181 had an infection rate of 0.01-0.50 and 0.099 had an infection rate of 0.51-1.00. Two genera of grasses, Cleistogenes and Koeleria, as well as twenty plant species, were previously unknown endophytic hosts in China. High infection rates (0.86-1.00) of plants of Achnatherum sibiricum were detected at all eleven sites studied. Other grasses in which high infection rates were found were Agropyron mongolicum, Roegneria turczaninovii, Agropyron elongate, Poa palustris and Poaangustifolia.

4001,ERICOID ENDOPHYTES OF WESTERN-AUSTRALIAN HEATHS (EPACRIDACEAE),"The presence of ericoid endophytes was confirmed in hair roots of 14 species of Epacridaceae native to the mediterranean south-west of Western Australia. The phenology of infection was followed in 2-yr-old seedlings of Astroloma xerophyllum D.C.

The field- and glasshouse-grown plants (subterranean and white clovers, field pea and leek) were colonized by indigenous mycorrhizal fungi. The [P] in intraradical hyphae was generally 60-170 mM, although up to 600 mM was recorded, and formed strong linear relationships with [K], up to 350 mM, and [Mg], up to 175 mM. Little Ca was detected. The turgid branches of young arbuscules contained 30-50 mM P, up to 100 mM K and little Mg. Collapsing arbuscule branches and clumped arbuscules had greatly elevated Ca (30-250 mM), but otherwise differed little from young arbuscule branches in elemental concentration. The [P] was low or undetectable in 86% of uncolonized cortical cell vacuoles, but was generally elevated in vacuoles surrounding an arbuscule and in the liquid surrounding hyphae in intercellular spaces.

4683,"Ecophysiological characteristics of the nematophagous fungus, Plectosphaerella plurivora, with biocontrol potential on Nacobbus aberrans s.l. in tomato","The plant-parasitic nematode, Nacobbus sp., is responsible for significant economic losses in horticultural production centers in Argentina and other countries in America, alone or in combination with other biotic and abiotic factors. Although the genus' distribution is restricted to the American continent, it has quarantine importance and is subject to international legislation to prevent its spread to other regions. The management of phytoparasitic nematodes using biological control strategies is a promising eco-compatible alternative, allowing for sustainability of the crop horticultural system. Firstly, this study ecophysiologically characterized Plectosphaerella plurivora SRA14, a strain with nematophagous activity on N. aberrans s.l. This fungal strain developed in vitro under a wide temperature range (20-30 & DEG;C), but the highest levels of water stress (& psi;: -7 and -10 Mpa; a(W): 0.95 and 0.93) inhibited its growth. While the production of extracellular enzymes by this strain was low, P. plurivora SRA14 was able to develop in the rhizosphere and endorhizosphere of the tomato and basil crops without affecting the plant vigor parameters or producing phytotoxicity signs. Secondly, this study evidenced the biocontrol activity of P. plurivora SRA14 on N. aberrans s.l. populations in tomato, implanted into both sterile (artificially inoculated) and naturally infested soils via greenhouse pot experiments.

While the alkaloid-mediated mechanism for herbivore resistance has been widely studied, underlying physiological mechanisms for increased tolerance to abiotic stress remain scarcely explored. In this study we used three maternal lines of perennial grass Festuca rubra to examine the role of antioxidants in endophyte-mediated effects on seed viability over long-term storage. Uncolonized plants (E-) were generated by removing the endophyte from ramets of naturally endophyte-colonized (E+) plants. The E + and E- ramets were planted in a common garden in Salamanca, Spain. Seeds produced in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were harvested at maturity, dried and stored at 10 A degrees C until 2011 when we tested seed and endophyte viability, and measured antioxidants. Seed viability and alpha-tocopherol antioxidant were negatively affected by the endophyte in two maternal lines. In these same lines, the endophyte viability was lowest at the longest storage time. In the maternal line that showed the highest negative effect of endophyte on seed viability, the pattern of glutathione was opposite to that observed for tocopherols since it was higher for E + than for E- seeds. In all maternal lines, the glutathione half-cell reduction potential (E-GSSG/2GSH) and % glutathione disulphide (GSSG) increased with storage time but there was no clear pattern associated with endophyte symbiosis. Whether these parameters are good predictors of seed and endophyte longevity in storage and natural conditions should be further explored.","Gundel, PE; Hamilton, CE; Seal, CE; Helander, M; Martinez-Ghersa, MA; Ghersa, CM; de Aldana, BRV; Zabalgogeazcoa, I; Saikkonen, K",SYMBIOSIS,2012,10.1007/s13199-012-0194-y,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.952394070037814,TRUE,2,4,Low,uncolonized,observed; studied; tested,to examine the role of antioxidants in endophyte-mediated effects on seed viability over long-term storage.

Host plant species, the composition and density of the surrounding plants, space, and abiotic drivers could significantly affect bacterial and fungal root endophyte communities. We investigated their influence in endophyte communities of alpine plants across a harsh high mountain landscape using high-throughput sequencing. There was less compositional overlap between fungal than bacterial root endophyte communities, with four 'cosmopolitan' bacterial OTUs found in every root sampled, but no fungal OTUs found across all samples. We found that host plant species, which included nine species from three families, explained the greatest variation in root endophyte composition for both bacterial and fungal communities. We detected similar levels of variation explained by plant neighborhood, space, and abiotic drivers on both communities, but the plant neighborhood explained less variation in fungal endophytes than expected. Overall, these findings suggest a more cosmopolitan distribution of bacterial OTUs compared to fungal OTUs, a structuring role of the plant host species for both communities, and largely similar effects of the plant neighborhood, abiotic drivers, and space on both communities.","Brigham, LM; de Mesquita, CPB; Spasojevic, MJ; Farrer, EC; Porazinska, DL; Smith, JG; Schmidt, SK; Suding, KN",FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY,2023,10.1093/femsec/fiad034,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.920312180396141,TRUE,2,4,Low,no fungal otus,sequencing; investigated; sampled,"bacterial root endophyte communities, with four 'cosmopolitan' bacterial OTUs found in every root sampled, but no fungal OTUs found across all samples.

The leading hypotheses—which focus on quantitative genetic mechanisms (dominance, overdominance, and epistasis) and molecular mechanisms (gene dosage and transcriptional regulation)—have been able to explain some but not all of the observed patterns of heterosis. Abiotic stressors are known to impact the expression of heterosis; however, the potential role of microbes in heterosis has largely been ignored. Here, we show that heterosis of root biomass and other traits in maize is strongly dependent on the belowground microbial environment. We found that, in some cases, inbred lines perform as well by these criteria as their F1 offspring under sterile conditions but that heterosis can be restored by inoculation with a simple community of seven bacterial strains. We observed the same pattern for seedlings inoculated with autoclaved versus live soil slurries in a growth chamber and for plants grown in steamed or fumigated versus untreated soil in the field. In a different field site, however, soil steaming increased rather than decreased heterosis, indicating that the direction of the effect depends on community composition, environment, or both. Together, our results demonstrate an ecological phenomenon whereby soil microbes differentially impact the early growth of inbred and hybrid maize. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

13545,Dark septate endophytes: A review of facultative biotrophic root-colonizing fungi,"Dark septate root endophytes (DSE) are conidial or sterile fungi (Deuteromycotina, Fungi Imperfecti) likely to be ascomycetous and colonizing plant roots. They have been reported for nearly 600 plant species representing about 320 genera and 100 families. DSE fungi occur from the tropics to arctic and alpine habitats and comprise a heterogeneous group that functionally and ecologically overlaps with soil fungi, saprotrophic rhizoplane-inhabiting fungi, obligately and facultatively pathogenic fungi and mycorrhizal fungi. Numerous species of undescribed sterile and anamorphic taxa may also await discovery. Although DSE are abundant in washed root and soil samples from various habitats, and are easily isolated from surface-sterilized roots of ecto-, ectendo-, endo- and non-mycorrhizal host species, their ecological functions are little understood. Studies of DSE thus far have yielded inconsistent results and only poorly illustrate the role of DSE in their natural habitats. These inconsistencies are largely due to the uncertain taxonomic affinities of the strains of DSE used. In addition, because different strains of a single anamorph taxon seem to vary greatly in function, no clear generalizations on their ecological role have been drawn. This paper reviews the current literature on DSE and the ecology and discusses the need for and direction of future research.",Jumpponen A.; Trappe J.M.,New Phytologist,1998,10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00265.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.97085597998567,TRUE,2,4,Low,sterile,isolated; sterile,"Dark septate root endophytes (DSE) are conidial or sterile fungi (Deuteromycotina, Fungi Imperfecti) likely to be ascomycetous and colonizing plant roots.

12315,The Paleobiosphere: a novel device for the in vivo testing of hydrocarbon producing-utilizing microorganisms,"The construction and testing of a unique instrument, the Paleobiosphere, which mimics some of the conditions of the ancient earth, is described. The instrument provides an experimental testing system for determining if certain microbes, when provided an adequate environment, can degrade biological materials to produce fuel-like hydrocarbons in a relatively short time frame that become trapped by the shale. The conditions selected for testing included a particulate Montana shale (serving as the ""Trap Shale""), plant materials (leaves and stems of three extant species whose origins are in the late Cretaceous), a water-circulating system, sterile air, and a specially designed Carbotrap through which all air was passed as exhaust and volatile were hydrocarbons trapped. The fungus for initial testing was Annulohypoxylon sp., isolated as an endophyte of Citrus aurantifolia. It produces, in solid and liquid media, a series of hydrocarbon-like molecules. Some of these including 1,8-cineole, 2-butanone, propanoic acid, 2-methyl-, methyl ester, benzene (1-methylethyl)-, phenylethyl alcohol, benzophenone and azulene, 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydro-1,4-dimethyl-7-(1-methylethenyl), [1S-(1 alpha,7 alpha,8a beta)]. These were the key signature compounds used in an initial Paleobiosphere test. After 3 weeks, incubation, the volatiles associated with the harvested ""Trap Shale"" included each of the signature substances as well as other fungal-associated products: some indanes, benzene derivatives, some cyclohexanes, 3-octanone, naphthalenes and others. The fungus thus produced a series of ""Trap Shale"" products that were representative of each of the major classes of hydrocarbons in diesel fuel (Mycodiesel). Initial tests with the Paleobiosphere offer some evidence for a possible origin of hydrocarbons trapped in bentonite shale.

3913,Isolation of actinobacterial endophytes from wheat sprouts as biocontrol agents to control seed pathogenic fungi,"Seed-borne Streptomyces can transmit vertically from generation to generation and be a mutualism between the endosymbionts and hosts. The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize endophytic Streptomyces strains from wheat sprouts, and to investigate their protection against wheat seed pathogenic fungi Penicillium. Endophytic Streptomyces sp. F6 and Streptomyces sp. F39 were isolated from wheat sprouts germinated under sterile conditions. Both Streptomyces strains could produce siderophores, and showed antagonistic activities against the seed pathogenic fungi Penicillium sp. Z17. The inoculation of Streptomyces sp.

However, the protection efficiency was impacted by the Streptomyces spore concentrations, the concentration ratios of Streptomyces spores to pathogen spores, and inoculation methods. The results suggested that wheat sprouts harbored diverse endophytic Streptomyces species which derived from wheat seeds, these strains should be more likely transmitted to the next generation, and confer competitive ability to pathogens on the offspring. Owing to the more intimate correlation between sprout endophytic flora with host plants, these strains are more suitable for mature plant interiors compared with those from rhizosphere soils and root interiors.","Deng, SS; Liu, YM; Deng, ZJ; Huang, YL",ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY,2021,10.1007/s00203-021-02581-3,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.975518250727778,TRUE,2,4,Low,sterile,isolated; sterile,"Endophytic Streptomyces sp.

However, when S-deficient plants were treated with metolachlor before benzoxazolin-2(3H)-one (BOA) incubation, detoxification was reduced, as indicated by a lower accumulation of the detoxification products BOA-6-O-glucoside and glucoside carbamate and by a loss of BOA-6-OH glucosyltransfease activity. Root colonizing microorganisms and the endophytic fungus Fusarium verticillioides participated in benzoxazolinone detoxification by converting the compound to 2-acetamidophenol (AAP) or O-hydroxyphenyl malonamic acid (OHPMA), a process accompanied by the appearance of phenoxazinone. Maize roots, however, absorbed AAP and OHPMA only in traces. Absorbed traces of OHPMA stimulated maize radicle growth, and traces of AAP stimulated cress. Phenoxazinone inhibited the growth of cress radicles at concentrations higher than 500 mu M, whereas maize radicles were hardly affected.

10304,Root contact dominates vegetative transmission of the Phialocephala fortinii s.l. - Acephala applanata species complex (PAC),"The Phialocephala fortinii s.l. - Acephala applanata species complex (PAC) is composed of closely related endophytic ascomycetes colonizing roots of coniferous trees. Their means of dispersal and teleomorphic form are still unknown. Accordingly, we focused on vegetative mycelial spread of PAC i) via root contacts from PACinoculated to PAC -free saplings, ii) through semi -sterile soil from PAC -colonized to PAC -free saplings (without contact) and iii) through semi -sterile soil from PAC -colonized substrate to PAC -free saplings (without contact). Five PAC strains were selected for the experiment. All three modes of PAC transmission found support and were confirmed by metabarcoding. However, transmission via root contact was found to be the most successful. Growth of PAC through soil was also observed whereby transmission from PAC -colonized substrate to PAC -free saplings was more frequent than transmission from PAC -colonized to PAC -free saplings. The transmission rates depended on the PAC strain. Overall, we found support for vegetative transmission of PAC via root contact and active mycelial spread through semi -sterile soil.","Stroheker, S; Dubach, V; Schlegel, M; Sieber, TN",FUNGAL ECOLOGY,2024,10.1016/j.funeco.2024.101351,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.868264059572986,TRUE,2,4,Low,sterile,sterile; observed,NA,contact was found to be the most successful.

3318,Survival and development of potato psyllid (Hemiptera: Triozidae) on Convolvulaceae: Effects of a plant-fungus symbiosis (Periglandula),"Plant species in the family Solanaceae are the usual hosts of potato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli (Sulc) (Hemiptera: Psylloidea: Triozidae). However, the psyllid has also been shown to develop on some species of Convolvulaceae (bindweeds and morning glories). Developmental success on Convolvulaceae is surprising given the rarity of psyllid species worldwide associated with this plant family. We assayed 14 species of Convolvulaceae across four genera (Convolvulus, Calystegia, Ipomoea, Turbina) to identify species that allow development of potato psyllid. Two populations of psyllids were assayed (Texas, Washington). The Texas population overlaps extensively with native Convolvulaceae, whereas Washington State is noticeably lacking in Convolvulaceae. Results of assays were overlain on a phylogenetic analysis of plant species to examine whether Convolvulaceae distantly related to the typical host (potato) were less likely to allow development than species of Convolvulaceae more closely related. Survival was independent of psyllid population and location of the plant species on our phylogenetic tree. We then examined whether presence of a fungal symbiont of Convolvulaceae (Periglandula spp.) affected psyllid survival. These fungi associate with Convolvulaceae and produce a class of mycotoxins (ergot alkaloids) that may confer protection against plant-feeding arthropods. Periglandula was found in 11 of our 14 species, including in two genera (Convolvulus, Calystegia) not previously known to host the symbiont. Of these 11 species, leaf tissues from five contained large quantities of two classes of ergot alkaloids (clavines, amides of lysergic acid) when evaluated by LC-MS/MS. All five species also harbored Periglandula. No ergot alkaloids were detected in species free of the fungal symbiont. Potato psyllid rapidly died on the five species that harbored Periglandula and contained ergot alkaloids, but survived to adulthood on seven of the nine species in which ergot alkaloids were not detected. These results support the hypothesis that a plant fungus symbiotic relationship affects the suitability of certain Convolvulaceae to potato psyllid.","Kaur, N; Cooper, WR; Duringer, JM; Badillo-Vargas, IE; Esparza-Diaz, G; Rashed, A; Horton, DR",PLOS ONE,2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0201506,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.945846681553041,TRUE,2,4,Low,not detected,examined; examined; evaluated,NA,"of psyllid population and location of the plant species on our phylogenetic tree.

1847,Competitiveness of endophytic Phialocephala fortinii s.l. - Acephala applanata strains in Norway spruce roots,"Dark septate endophytes of the Phialocephala fortinii s.l. Acephala applanata species complex (PAC) are presumed to be the most abundant root colonizing endophytes of conifers across the Northern hemisphere. To test the competitiveness of different PAC strains, PAC-free Picea abies saplings were inoculated with five different PAC strains by planting them in pre-colonized substrates. Saplings were left to grow for six weeks and then transplanted crosswise into a substrate colonized by one of the other four strains for a further two weeks. PAC were isolated and genotyped using microsatellite markers. The power of colonization, i.e. the ability of colonizing roots already colonized by another PAC strain, and the power of retention, i.e. the ability of a resident strain of not being suppressed by an invading PAC strain, were calculated for each strain in every combination. The experiment was run twice under two different climatic conditions. Our results show that PAC strains differ (1) in their ability to colonize PAC-free, non sterile roots, (2) in resistance against being suppressed by another PAC strain and (3) in their ability to invade roots already colonized by another PAC strain. In addition, both the PAC PAC and the PAC-host interactions depend on the climatic conditions. (C) 2018 British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

One hundred and twenty female and 60 male chicks (5 weeks old) were selected from a larger group of chicks and were randomly allocated to one of three dietary treatments (Diet 1, Diet 2 and Diet 3). Two females and one male were housed in each of 60 battery breeder cages. A quail breeder diet was formulated to contain 45% fescue seed plus corn, soybean meal, vitamins and minerals. The fescue seed used for Diet 1 was 100% endophyte infected, while that used for Diet 2 and Diet 3 was not infected. Birds on Diet 1 and Diet 2 were fed on an ad libitum basis, while the feed intake of birds on Diet 3 was restricted to that of birds on Diet 1. The daily photoperiod of 6 hours was increased to 16 hours by 60 days of age, at which time the hens began to lay eggs. Dietary treatments were star-ted at 35 days of age. Eggs were collected daily, set weekly and incubated through hatching. The results indicated no differences (P>0.05) in average daily gain (ADG) or average daily intake (ADI) among the 3 treatments. There was also no difference (P>0.05) in egg production among the 3 treatments. However, there was a significant reduction (P<0.05) in the percentage of fertility (approximately 10%) and in the percentage of hatchability of the total number of eggs (approximately 12%) between Diet 2 and Diet 3 versus Diet 1. There was no significant difference in the hatchability of fertile eggs.

Although it is generally considered tolerant to different diseases, it is quite susceptible to the fungus Plenodomus destruens that causes foot-rot disease. Plant growth-promoting bacteria associated with sweet potato remain poorly studied, but some Bacillus strains may have potential as biological control agents. Here, we evaluate the persistence of two bacterial strainsBacillus safensis T052-76 and Bacillus velezensis T149-19in pot experiments and assess their impact on indigenous bacterial and fungal communities associated with sweet potato. Numbers of cells of both strains introduced into pots remained stable in the rhizosphere of sweet potato over the 180-day experiment.

55,Beneficial endophytic fungi improve the yield and quality of Salvia miltiorrhiza by performing different ecological functions,"Background. Endophytic fungi can enhance the growth and synthesis of secondary metabolites in medicinal plants. Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge is frequently employed for treating cardiovascular and cerebrovascular ailments, with the primary bioactive components being salvianolic acid and tanshinone. However, their levels in cultivated S. miltiorrhiza are inferior to that of the wild herbs, so the production of highquality medicinal herbs is sharply declining. Consequently, the utilization of beneficial endophytic fungi to improve the yield and quality of S. miltiorrhiza holds great significance for the cultivation of medicinal plants. Methods. In this study, nine non-pathogenic, endophytic fungal strains were introduced into sterile S. miltiorrhiza seedlings and cultivated both in vitro and in situ (the greenhouse). The effects of these strains on the growth indices, C and N metabolism, antioxidant activity, photosynthesis, and content of bioactive ingredients in S. miltiorrhiza were then evaluated. Results. The results showed that the different genera, species, or strains of endophytic fungi regulated the growth and metabolism of S. miltiorrhiza in unique ways. These endophytic fungi primarily exerted their growth -promoting effects by increasing the net photosynthetic rate, intercellular CO2 concentration, and the activities of sucrose synthase, sucrose phosphate synthase, nitrate reductase, and glutamine synthetase. They also enhanced the adaptability and resistance to environmental stresses by improving the synthesis of osmoregulatory compounds and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. However, their regulatory effects on the growth and development of S. miltiorrhiza were affected by environmental changes. Moreover, the strains that significantly promoted the synthesis and accumulation of phenolic acids inhibited the accumulation of tanshinones components, and vice versa. The endophytic fungal strains Penicillium meloforme DS8, Berkeleyomyces basicola DS10, and Acremonium sclerotigenum DS12 enhanced the bioaccumulation of tanshinones. Fusarium solani DS16 elevated the rosmarinic acid content and yields in S. miltiorrhiza. The strain Penicillium javanicum DS5 improved the contents of dihydrotanshinone, salvianolic acid B, and rosmarinic acid. The strains P. meloforme DS8 and B. basicola DS10 improved resistance. Conclusion. Various endophytic fungi affected the quality and yield of S. miltiorrhiza by regulating different physiological and metabolic pathways. This study also provides a novel and effective method to maximize the effects of beneficial endophytic fungi by selecting specific strains to design microbial communities based on the different ecological functions of endophytic fungi under varying environments and for specific production goals.","Li, XY; Lin, YL; Qin, Y; Han, GQ; Wang, H; Yan, ZY",PEERJ,2024,10.7717/peerj.16959,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999468713677721,TRUE,2,3,Low,sterile,sterile; evaluated,"of medicinal plants.

The presence of Epichloe endophytes alters the nutritive quality of its hosts by modifying several plant traits. The aim of this research was to develop a fast method based on near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to discriminate between perennial ryegrass plants infected (E+) or not infected (E-) with two endophyte species, Epichloe festucae var. lolii, and Epichloe typhina, using a heterogonous set of perennial ryegrass samples collected from wild grasslands and cultivars. Epichloe festucae var. lolii cultures show two morphotypes, M1 and M3, and Epichloe typhina cultures have a different M2 morphotype. RESULTSNear-infrared reflectance spectra from E+ and E- ryegrass plants were recorded. Applying the best NIRS model for the detection of Epichloe, 93.3% of E+ plants were classified correctly. The NIRS morphotype classification was correct for 92.9% of M1 morphotype and 100% of M2 morphotypes. The NIRS classification of M3 morphotypes was not as accurate, but it was in accordance with the fungal species classification, identifying some M3 as M1 morphotypes. CONCLUSIONNear-infrared reflectance spectroscopy can detect the presence of Epichloe fungal endophytes directly in samples of perennial ryegrass, and it is adequate for discriminating among fungal species.

9655,Fungal Endophytes and Their Role in Agricultural Plant Protection against Pests and Pathogens,"Virtually all examined plant species harbour fungal endophytes which asymptomatically infect or colonize living plant tissues, including leaves, branches, stems and roots. Endophyte-host interactions are complex and span the mutualist-pathogen continuum. Notably, mutualist endophytes can confer increased fitness to their host plants compared with uncolonized plants, which has attracted interest in their potential application in integrated plant health management strategies. In this review, we report on the many benefits that fungal endophytes provide to agricultural plants against common non-insect pests such as fungi, bacteria, nematodes, viruses, and mites. We report endophytic modes of action against the aforementioned pests and describe why this broad group of fungi is vitally important to current and future agricultural practices.

4701,Limited Impact of Soil Microorganisms on the Endophytic Bacteria of Tartary Buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum),"Soil has been considered the main microbial reservoir for plants, but the robustness of the plant microbiome when the soil resource is removed has not been greatly considered. In the present study, we tested the robustness of the microbiota recruited by Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum Gaertn.), grown on sterile humus soil and irrigated with sterile water. Our results showed that the microbiomes of the leaf, stem, root and next-generation seeds were comparable between treated (grown in sterile soil) and control plants (grown in non-sterile soil), indicating that the plants had alternative robust ways to shape their microbiome. Seed microbiota contributed greatly to endophyte communities in the phyllosphere, rhizosphere and next-generation seeds. The microbiome originated from the seeds conferred clear benefits to seedling growth because seedling height and the number of leaves were significantly increased when grown in sterilized soil. The overall microbiome of the plant was affected very little by the removal of the soil microbial resource. The microbial co-occurrence network exhibited more interactions, and Proteobacteria was enriched in the root of Tartary buckwheat planted in sterilized soil.

We investigated an endophyte Pseudomonas viridiflava CDRTc14, which impacted growth of its host Lepidium draba L., to better understand the possible genetic determinants for herbicidal and host-interaction traits. Inoculation tests with a variety of target plants revealed that CDRTc14 shows plant-specific effects ranging from beneficial to negative. Its herbicidal effect appeared to be dose-dependent and resembled phenotypically the germination arrest factor of Pseudomonas fluorescens WH6. CDRTc14 shares 183 genes with the herbicidal strain WH6 but the formylaminooxyvinylglycine (FVG) biosynthetic genes responsible for germination arrest of WH6 was not detected. CDRTc14 showed phosphate solubilizing ability, indole acetic acid and siderophores production in vitro and harbors genes for these functions. Moreover, genes for quorum sensing, hydrogen cyanide and ACC deaminase production were also found in this strain. Although, CDRTc14 is related to plant pathogens, we neither found a complete pathogenicity island in the genome, nor pathogenicity symptoms on susceptible plant species upon CDRTc14 inoculation.

10950,Tolerance and accumulation of lead by endophytic association between Festuca arundinacea and Lewia sp.,"Endophyte assisted phytoremediation is an environmentally friendly alternative for the remediation and treatment of soils contaminated with heavy metals. The effect of the association between endophytic fungus (Lewia sp.) and Festuca arundinacea on the tolerance and accumulation of lead (Pb) was studied after 45 days of culture in contaminated soil. The tolerance to 2,500 mg Pb kg(-1) was quantified by biomass production and the accumulation of lead in shoots and roots. The phytoremediation potential was quantified by estimating the tolerance index (TI), the bioaccumulation factor (BCF) and translocation factor (TF). The Pb accumulation in roots (14 +/- 4.2 mg g(-1)), was 3-fold higher in plants inoculated in comparison with only plant (3.73 +/- 0.64 mg g(-1)); The TI was 0.76 and 0.56, the BCF was 0.31 and 0.23 for inoculated and non-inoculated plants, respectively. The TF was not detected in both cases, indicates that when working with this association there is not risk of trophic transfer of lead, according to parameters obtained, Lewia sp. improved growth and tolerance of F. arundinacea in Pb contaminated soil.

In this study, we evaluated Trichoderma asperellum spread and impact on endophytic fungi occurring naturally in leaf, stem and root tissues after application through foliar spraying, stem infusion, and soil drenching into cacao seedling of two, four, and five months old respectively. This fungus was isolated from all plant tissues, although by stem infusion was not detected in leaf tissues, and regulated different co-occurring fungal endophytes influenced by seedling age. Dominant endophytes detected were Fusarium 1 and 3 in seedlings used for foliar spraying, morphospecies 1 and 3, and Lasiodiplodia 1 in seedlings used for stem infusion, and Lasiodiplodia 2, 3 and 4, and Paecilomyces in seedlings used for soil drenching. In general, these dominant fungi were more numerous in tissues of the control than in those inoculated with T. asperellum over three weeks post inoculation, but instead four weeks post inoculation. The pattern changed in tissues following soil drenching where higher colonization of dominant fungi in treated seedlings began earlier. These data showed that T. asperellum can deploy systemically, through the application of foliar spraying, infusion, and soil drenching, to almost all parts of the cacao plant even in the presence of endogenous fungal endophytes and the last fungi their self can reach high colonization in the presence of T. Asperellum.

Isolates of endophytic fungi were isolated from fruit, leaf and twig. Methanolic extracts were prepared by maceration. Antimicrobial activity was determined by the disc diffusion method. Antiradical activity was evaluated by the 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazyl (DPPH) assay. Ten endophytic fungi were recovered from the twig (6), leaf (2) and fruit (2) of A. nilotica. Extracts revealed better antifungal activity, with isolates T3, L1 and F1 exerting the highest inhibition zones (20.6, 20 and 18.3 mm, respectively) against Aspergillus niger. Isolates T4 and T5 revealed the highest antiradical effect with IC50 values of 302 and 478 µg/mL respectively. Chemical analysis revealed that gallic acid and naringenin were the dominant compounds. Their pattern divided the endophytic fungi into two categories; gallic acid-rich endophytes including isolates L1 and L2 (isolated from the leaf) as well as isolates T4 and T2 (isolated from the twig). The other category was naringenin-rich endophytes comprised isolates F1 and F2, which were isolated from the fruit, and isolates T1, T3, T5 and T6 isolated from the twig.

Cd exposure reduced plant dry mass and enzyme activities of CAT and APX, but it increased GST activity. The presence of F. mosseae and P. indica (alone or together) caused an increase in plant dry mass and activities of CAT, APX and GST. In response to Cd exposure, transcriptional level of CAT was decreased but, transcription of APX and GST was up-regulated. Although F. mosseae induced the expression of the antioxidant genes, P. indica was not detected to have such a strong induction in the genes expression. The results obtained from this study suggest that F. mosseae and P. indica can be used to alleviate Cd stress in wheat plants in contaminated soil.

Two arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi belonging to different Glomus species were assayed. Populations of S-cycling microorganisms varied along the growth period for both AM fungi colonized and uncolonized plants, with significant quantitative and qualitative changes in the mycorrhizal compared with the non-mycorrhizal root zone, The occurrence of autotrophic sulphur oxidizers in pot cultures colonized with G. fasciculatum was significantly higher than in non-mycorrhizal ones throughout the plant growth period. The population size of this group was similar in non-mycorrhizal and G. mosseae colonized soil, The population of anaerobic sulphur mineralizing microorganisms was significantly decreased by mycorrhizal colonization. In contrast, pot cultures colonized by G. mosseae or G. fasciculatum had a higher quantity of sulphate-reducing bacteria than the control. The fact that the autotrophic S oxidizers and sulphate-reducing root-associated microorganisms were selectively stimulated by each one of the AM fungi assayed is a noticeable aspect. The maximum activity of the microbial processes regarding specific groups was at 15 days for the mineralizing, 45 days for the oxidizing and 0 days for the reducing microorganisms. In the case of autotrophic S oxidizers, the maximum population was achieved by 30 days in G. fasciculatum colonized treatment. From the data on occurrence of physiological grouping of sulphur-cycling microorganisms, we can deduce that a different ecological situation existed in the rhizosphere developed by non-mycorrhizal plants compared with those colonized by each one of the mycorrhizal endophytes.

4110,Evaluation of Biological Agents for Control of Macrophomina Root Rot and Powdery Mildew in Flowering Dogwood (Cornus florida L.),"Six biological control agents (BCAs) (two bacteria, two fungi, and two yeasts) that were previously shown to be effective against powdery mildew (Erysiphe pulchra) were tested for efficacy against Macrophomina phaseolina root rot on flowering dogwood (Cornus florida) in the greenhouse. Two of the bacterial isolates, Stenotrophomonas sp. (B17A) and Serratia sp. (B17B), were effective in controlling both macrophomina root rot and powdery mildew, similar to fungicide control thiophanate methyl, when roots were drenched with the six BCAs individually. In addition, the two bacterial BCAs improved plant growth with respect to stem diameter, stem length, dry weight, and green foliage compared with fungicide-treated plants or nontreated controls grown in sterile soil. These results confirm previous results in which B17A and B17B suppressed powdery mildew and also promoted plant growth in flowering dogwood. Although macrophomina root rot has been previously reported as a potential problem in flowering dogwood, especially in field conditions, simultaneous infection with macrophomina root rot and powdery mildew has not been previously reported. This study confirmed that M. phaseolina infection was characterized by stubby roots and black root lesions, and plants infected with both powdery mildew and macrophomina root rot had smaller root mass compared with fungicide-treated plants. Neither of the two pathogens killed their host plants, but compounded infections significantly reduced the plant root system and plant growth. The efficacy of the two bacterial isolates in controlling both powdery mildew and macrophomina root rot suggests their potential utilization in controlling both diseases in dogwood nursery production and in other plants that are hosts to both powdery mildew and macrophomina root rot. Plant growth promoted by the two BCAs may be attributed to powdery mildew and macrophomina root rot control, but comparisons between fungicide-treated plants and control plants not inoculated with BCAs or root rot pathogen suggested that the two BCAs may play a role as bio-stimulants in growth enhancement.

3210,Friend or foe: differential responses of rice to invasion by mutualistic or pathogenic fungi revealed by RNAseq and metabolite profiling,"The rice endophyte Harpophora oryzae shares a common pathogenic ancestor with the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Direct comparison of the interactions between a single plant species and two closely-related (1) pathogenic and (2) mutualistic fungi species can improve our understanding of the evolution of the interactions between plants and fungi that lead to either mutualistic or pathogenic interactions. Differences in the metabolome and transcriptome of rice in response to challenge by H. or M. oryzae were investigated with GC-MS, RNA-seq, and qRT-PCR. Levels of metabolites of the shikimate and lignin biosynthesis pathways increased continuously in the M. oryzae-challenged rice roots (Mo-roots); these pathways were initially induced, but then suppressed, in the H. oryzae-challenged rice roots (Ho-roots). Compared to control samples, concentrations of sucrose and maltose were reduced in the Ho-roots and Mo-roots.

11976,Photo-Fenton plus Solanum nigrum L. weed plants integrated process for the abatement of highly concentrated metalaxyl on waste waters,"The treatment of a highly concentrated pesticide and systemic fungicide solution, containing metalaxyl as active compound (150 mg L-1), was investigated by using the photo-Fenton process in combination with Solanum nigrum L weed plants. High concentration of metalaxyl has a destructive effect on S. nigrum plants although this pesticide can be successfully degraded by the photo-Fenton process. S. nigrum seed germination and seedling development were not affected by iron species at concentrations lower than 11 mg L-1, which is well above the optimal dosage for the photo-Fenton process (4 mg L-1). In addition, at the referred optimal dosage, S. nigrum growth was not affected and those plants were able to extract large amounts of iron species from the solution (between 1.5-2.0 and 0.2-0.5 mg of Fe per gram of dry weight of plant in their roots and shoots, respectively). Negative effects on biomass production and chlorophyll and carotenoids contents, used as stress biomarkers, were not detected. When S. nigrum plants were directly exposed to the solution pre-treated by the photo-Fenton process, an increase in glutathione-S-transferase activity in shoots, some toxicity towards the plant physiology and a decrease in the total soluble protein content, in both shoots and roots, were observed; nevertheless, the plant growth was still remarkable. These results suggest that the photo-Fenton process can be used as a chemical primary treatment, followed by S. nigrum plants biological remediation (as post-treatment) for waste waters that are contaminated with concentrations of metalaxyl as high as 150 mg L-1.

In this study, we inoculated sterile drought-stressed Ormosia hosiei seedlings with the DSE species Acrocalymma vagum to determine the role that the DSE plays in seedling growth and drought tolerance of O. hosiei. We investigated whether inoculation with DSE affected the leaf morphology, anatomical structure, pigments, photosynthesis, and chloroplast ultrastructure. Inoculated seedlings and non-inoculated seedlings were grown under three different soil water conditions (well-watered, 75% of field water capacity; moderate water, 55% of field water capacity; or low water, 35% of field water capacity) for 114 days. The leaf length, leaf width, leaf area, leaf dry weight, leaf palisade tissue thickness, vascular bundle area, and the inner diameter of vessels of the inoculated seedlings were significantly greater than those of non-inoculated seedlings. Furthermore, the content of pigments, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and the transpiration rate of inoculated seedlings were significantly higher than those of the non-inoculated seedlings, whereas the intracellular CO2 concentration was significantly lower than that of non-inoculated seedlings. The mitochondria, chloroplasts, and cell membrane were well preserved under water stress in the inoculated seedlings, whereas the chloroplasts and other leaf cell organelles of the non-inoculated seedlings were severely damaged. Our results indicate that inoculating O. hosiei with a DSE could be a promising biological approach with the potential to promote the survival of these trees.","Liu, Y; Wei, XL",PLANT ECOLOGY,2021,10.1007/s11258-021-01135-3,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.974342714384993,TRUE,2,3,Low,sterile,sterile; investigated,"DSEs in improving the drought tolerance of trees is poor.

5370,"Microbial colonisation rewires the composition and content of poplar root exudates, root and shoot metabolomes","BackgroundTrees are associated with a broad range of microorganisms colonising the diverse tissues of their host. However, the early dynamics of the microbiota assembly microbiota from the root to shoot axis and how it is linked to root exudates and metabolite contents of tissues remain unclear. Here, we characterised how fungal and bacterial communities are altering root exudates as well as root and shoot metabolomes in parallel with their establishment in poplar cuttings (Populus tremula x tremuloides clone T89) over 30 days of growth. Sterile poplar cuttings were planted in natural or gamma irradiated soils. Bulk and rhizospheric soils, root and shoot tissues were collected from day 1 to day 30 to track the dynamic changes of fungal and bacterial communities in the different habitats by DNA metabarcoding. Root exudates and root and shoot metabolites were analysed in parallel by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. ResultsOur study reveals that microbial colonisation triggered rapid and substantial alterations in both the composition and quantity of root exudates, with over 70 metabolites exclusively identified in remarkably high abundances in the absence of microorganisms. Noteworthy among these were lipid-related metabolites and defence compounds. The microbial colonisation of both roots and shoots exhibited a similar dynamic response, initially involving saprophytic microorganisms and later transitioning to endophytes and symbionts. Key constituents of the shoot microbiota were also discernible at earlier time points in the rhizosphere and roots, indicating that the soil constituted a primary source for shoot microbiota. Furthermore, the microbial colonisation of belowground and aerial compartments induced a reconfiguration of plant metabolism. Specifically, microbial colonisation predominantly instigated alterations in primary metabolism in roots, while in shoots, it primarily influenced defence metabolism. ConclusionsThis study highlighted the profound impact of microbial interactions on metabolic pathways of plants, shedding light on the intricate interplay between plants and their associated microbial communities.2SWtA3_gUD-Xt4Z7N25436Video Abstract ConclusionsThis study highlighted the profound impact of microbial interactions on metabolic pathways of plants, shedding light on the intricate interplay between plants and their associated microbial communities.2SWtA3_gUD-Xt4Z7N25436Video Abstract","Fracchia, F; Guinet, F; Engle, NL; Tschaplinski, TJ; Veneault-Fourrey, C; Deveau, A",MICROBIOME,2024,10.1186/s40168-024-01888-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.892600192770349,TRUE,2,3,Low,sterile,sterile; collected,"establishment in poplar cuttings (Populus tremula x tremuloides clone T89) over 30 days of growth.

6150,Metabolic Regulation and Saline-Alkali Stress Response in Novel Symbionts of Epichloe bromicola-Bromus inermis,"Epichloe endophytic fungi are important microbial resources in agriculture and animal husbandry. Because of their stable symbiosis, species transmission, and positive effects on host plants, the use of endophytic fungi in grass breeding is of great significance. In this study, six inoculation methods were used, including the sterile seedling slit inoculation method, sterile seedling cut inoculation method, sterile seedling injection inoculation method, seed soaking inoculation method, seed piercing and then soaking inoculation method, and seed slit inoculation method. Spectrometry was used to construct new symbionts, and Liquid Chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to analyze the effects of endophytic fungi on the metabolism of new hosts. The physiological response of the new symbionts to salt and alkali stress was studied using a pot experiment. The results were as follows: In this study, Epichloe bromicola was successfully inoculated into Bromus inermis via the sterile seedling slit inoculation method, and new symbionts (EI) were obtained; the vaccination rate was 2.1%. Metabolites up-regulated by EI are significantly enriched in citrate cycle and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, suggesting that the symbiosis of endophytic fungi indirectly triggers the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through multiple metabolic pathways. The saline-alkali stress test showed that the host antioxidant system was active after inoculation, and the total antioxidant capacity was significantly increased compared with non-symbionts (EF) under mild stress (p < 0.05), which provided important clues to reveal the complex mechanism of plant-fungus symbiosis.

3072,Effect of Cryptomycina pteridis on Pteridium aquilinum,"Pteridium aquilinum, noninfected and naturally infected with Cryptomycina pteridis, was studied in western South Dakota from 1990-1992. Time of frond emergence in 1990 and 1991 was not significantly different between fronds in noninfected plots and fronds in infected plots. Initial P. aquilinum populations in noninfected plots were significantly higher than populations in infected plots (P = 0.01), but the fungus did not significantly reduce populations in infected plots during the study. Frequency of infected fronds increased in infected plots. In infected plots mean heights of noninfected fronds were not significantly different from infected fronds except in 1990 and 1992 (P = 0.05) at the Big Hill plot where potassium levels were limiting. Biomass from noninfected and infected plots, and biomass from noninfected and infected fronds in infected plots were not significantly different. Stipes of infected fronds were significantly thicker than stipes of noninfected fronds (P = 0.0001). Infected fronds were brittle. Brittle frond texture and fungal stromatal development were strongly correlated (r = 0.9295-0.9701). The fungus grew in and between mesophyll cells of pinnules and formed subepidermal stromata in substomatal cavities. The fungus was commonly found in the cortex of the stipe, rachises, and costae, and in vascular bundles of rhizomes. Cells not infected or adjacent to infected cells appeared normal.

For analysis, QuEChERS method was optimized, and the analytical performance of those two pesticides was verified. Then, the method was applied to strawberry flowers and the pollen was sampled during three field campaigns. While abamectin was not detected, the systemic fungicide difenoconazole was determined in almost all flowers and pollen samples, demonstrating the major persistence of this pesticide in investigated matrices. The results were then discussed about the difenoconazole application rate and transport to colonies to estimate a preliminary environmental risk assessment for stingless native bees.

Insects, plants, and fungi, highly speciose groups of organisms, conceal a vast fungal biodiversity. An approximation of the total number of fungal species on Earth remains an elusive goal, but estimates should include fungal species hidden in associations with other organisms.

Fungi rely on associates for dispersal to fresh habitats and, under some conditions, provide them with competitive advantages. New methods are available to discover microscopic fungi that previously have been overlooked. In fungal conservation efforts, it is essential not only to discover hidden fungi but also to determine if they are rare or actually endangered.

Survival, germination, and growth of Epichloe typhina and significance chardgrass. Plant Dis. 97:323-328. Epichloe typhina is an important stroma-producing endophytic ascomycete that is responsible for significant yield loss in orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata) seed production fields. Infection is presumed to occur through leaves or stems, although details of the infection process and conditions that favor leaf infection are not well understood. The primary objectives of this study were to investigate the early stages of infection, including the effect of temperature or water potential on ascospore germination and subsequent growth of E. typhina, the tolerance of ascospores to desiccation, the requirement of leaf wounds for infection of orchardgrass by E. typhina, and the potential for insects to facilitate infection. Ascospores tolerated dry conditions, with at least 40% surviving 12 days under desiccation Germination and growth of of leaf wounds and insects in infection of of E. typhina was greatest at 25 degrees C, with little to no growth at 5 and 35 degrees C.

19981,STRUCTURAL INCOMPATIBILITY OF VAM FUNGI IN GENTIANACEAE,"Recently, we described special structures of VAM fungi in the roots of all gentians as a characteristic of the symbiosis with this phanerogamic family. But it was not possible to classify these typical structured fungi. Now, roots of several flowering plants, cultivated under sterile conditions, could be successfully inoculated with VAM fungi of the gentians. It is remarkable that the infection shows now the well known structures of VAM (Glomus species for example) in flowering plants. In addition, we used these infected roots from the non gentians as inoculum for several gentians of different species. Promptly, in all gentians all VAM fungi form the typical structures as described earlier in gentians.

In the genus Bromus, no information is available about this association in polyploid populations. The incidence of Neotyphodium spp. endophytes in diploid and tetraploid commercial cultivars of L. multiflorum, as well as in natural hexaploid populations of genus Bromus, was analysed. Observed infection was higher in diploid populations of L. multiflorum than in tetraploid populations. No infection was detected in Bromus spp. Various factors such as the production and handling of commercial seeds, the interaction of endophytes with ploidy level, and the genetic manipulation of seeds are discussed as the possible causes for the differences observed between natural and improved annual ryegrass and brome populations, and between diploid and tetraploid annual ryegrass.","Franco, MF; Colabelli, MN; Petigrosso, LR; De Battista, JP; Echeverria, MM",NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,2015,10.1080/00288233.2015.1011283,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98776398335743,TRUE,2,2,Low,no infection,observed,analysed.

11086,Growth promotion and disease resistance induced in Anthurium colonized by the beneficial root endophyte Piriformospora indica,"Background: Anthurium andraeanum, an important ornamental flower, has to go through a growth-delaying period after transfer from tissue culture to soil, which requires time and extra costs. Furthermore, during this period, the plantlets are highly susceptible to bacterial infections, which results in impaired development and severe losses. Here, we aimed to address whether application of the endophytic fungus, Piriformospora indica protects the A. andraeanum root system during the critical propagation period, and whether P. indica reduce the mortality rate by stimulating the host's resistance against diseases. Results: We demonstrate that P. indica shortens the recovery period of Anthurium, promotes growth and confers disease resistance. The beneficial effect of P. indica results in faster elongation of Anthurium roots early in the interaction. P. indica-colonized plants absorb more phosphorus and exhibit higher photosynthesis rates than uncolonized control plants. Moreover, higher activities of stress-related enzymes, of jasmonic acid levels and mRNA levels of jasmonic acid-responsive genes suggest that the fungus prepares the plant to respond more efficiently to potentially upcoming threats, including bacterial wilt. Conclusion: These results suggest that P. indica is a helpful symbiont for promoting Anthurium rooting and development. All our evidences are sufficient to support the disease resistance conferred by P. indica through the plant-fungal symbiosis. Furthermore, it implicates that P. indica has strong potential as bio-fertilizer for utilization in ornamental plant cultivation.","Lin, HF; Xiong, J; Zhou, HM; Chen, CM; Lin, FZ; Xu, XM; Oelmüller, R; Xu, WF; Yeh, KW",BMC PLANT BIOLOGY,2019,10.1186/s12870-019-1649-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.970978731616844,TRUE,2,2,Low,uncolonized,culture,"in the interaction.

7097,A New Species in Pseudophialophora From Wild Rice and Beneficial Potential,"Wild rice (Oryza granulata) is a natural resource pool containing abundant unknown endophytic fungi species. There are few reports on the endophytic fungi in wild rice. Here, one isolate recovered from wild rice roots was identified as a new species Pseudophialophora oryzae sp. nov based on the molecular phylogeny and morphological characteristics. Fluorescent protein-expressing P. oryzae was used to monitor the fungal colonization pattern. Hyphae invaded the epidermis to the inner cortex but not into the root stele. The inoculation of P. oryzae promoted the rice growth, with the growth parameters of chlorophyll content, shoot height, root length, fresh shoot weight, fresh root weight and dry weight increasing by 24.10, 35.32, 19.35, 90.00, 33.3, and 79.17%, respectively. P. oryzae induced up-regulation of nitrate transporter OsPTR9 and potassium transporter OsHAK16 by 7.28 +/- 0.84 and 2.57 +/- 0.80 folds, promoting nitrogen and potassium elements absorption. In addition, P. oryzae also conferred a systemic resistance against rice blast, showing a 72.65 and 75.63% control rate in sterile plates and potting conditions. This systemic resistance was mediated by the strongly up-regulated expression of resistance-related genes NAC, OsSAUR2, OsWRKY71, EL5, and PR1 alpha. Since P. oryzae can promote rice growth, biomass and induce systemic disease resistance, it can be further developed as a new biogenic agent for agricultural production, providing a new approach for biocontrol of rice blast.","Zhu, JN; Yu, YJ; Dai, MD; Zeng, YL; Lu, XJ; Wang, L; Liu, XH; Su, ZZ; Lin, FC",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2022,10.3389/fmicb.2022.845104,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.92573846110782,TRUE,2,2,Low,sterile,sterile,"conferred a systemic resistance against rice blast, showing a 72.65 and 75.63% control rate in sterile plates and potting conditions.

12329,Growth Promotion of Chinese Cabbage and Arabidopsis by Piriformospora indica Is Not Stimulated by Mycelium-Synthesized Auxin,"Piriformospora indica, an endophytic fungus of the order Sebacinales, interacts with the roots of a large variety of plant species. We compared the interaction of this fungus with Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris subsp. chinensis) and Arabidopsis seedlings. The development of shoots and roots of Chinese cabbage seedlings was strongly promoted by P indica and the fresh weight of the seedlings increased approximately twofold. The strong stimulation of root hair development resulted in a bushy root phenotype. The auxin level in the infected Chinese cabbage roots was twofold higher compared with the uncolonized controls. Three classes of auxin-related genes, which were upregulated by P indica in Chinese cabbage roots, were isolated from a double-subtractive expressed sequence tag library: genes for proteins related to cell wall acidification, intercellular auxin transport carrier proteins such as AUX1, and auxin signal proteins. Overexpression of B. campestris BcAUX1 in Arabidopsis strongly promoted growth and biomass production of Arabidopsis seedlings and plants; the roots were highly branched but not bushy when compared with colonized Chinese cabbage roots. This suggests that BcAUX1 is a target of P indica in Chinese cabbage. P indica also promoted growth of Arabidopsis seedlings but the auxin levels were not higher and auxin genes were not upregulated, implying that auxin signaling is a more important target of P indica in Chinese cabbage than in Arabidopsis. The fungus also stimulated growth of Arabidopsis aux1 and aux1/axr4 and rhd6 seedlings. Furthermore, a component in an exudate fraction from P. indica but not auxin stimulated growth of Chinese cabbage and Arabidopsis seedlings. We propose that activation of auxin biosynthesis and signaling in the roots might be the cause for the P indica-mediated growth phenotype in Chinese cabbage.","Lee, YC; Johnson, JM; Chien, CT; Sun, C; Cai, DG; Lou, BG; Oelmüller, R; Yeh, KW",MOLECULAR PLANT-MICROBE INTERACTIONS,2011,10.1094/MPMI-05-10-0110,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.960056161175153,TRUE,2,2,Low,uncolonized,isolated,"The auxin level in the infected Chinese cabbage roots was twofold higher compared with the uncolonized controls.

10231,Plant functional traits and phylogenetic relatedness explain variation in associations with root fungal endophytes in an extreme arid environment,"Since root endophytes may ameliorate drought stress, understanding which plants associate with endophytes is important, especially in arid ecosystems. Here, the root endophytes were characterized of 42 plants from an arid region of Argentina. Colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSEs) was related to plant functional type (PFT), family, and phylogenetic relatedness. Overall, three main findings were observed. Firstly, only moderate levels of endophyte associations were found across all taxa (e.g., most Poaceae were not colonized by endophytes despite numerous accounts of colonization by AMF and DSEs). We determined 69 % of plant taxa associated with some form of root endophyte but levels were lower than other regional studies. Secondly, comparisons by PFT and phylogeny were often qualitatively similar (e.g., succulents and Portulacineae consistently lacked AMF; variation occurred among terrestrial vs. epiphytic bromeliads) and often differed from comparisons based on plant family. Thirdly, comparisons by plant family often failed to account for important variation either within families (e.g., Bromeliaceae and Poaceae) or trait conservatism among related families (i.e., Rosidae consistently lacked DSEs and Portulacineae lacked AMF). This study indicates the value of comparing numerous taxa based on PFTs and phylogenetic similarity. Overall, the results suggest an uncertain benefit of endophytes in extremely arid environments where plant traits like succulence may obviate the need to establish associations.","Lugo, MA; Reinhart, KO; Menoyo, E; Crespo, EM; Urcelay, C",MYCORRHIZA,2015,10.1007/s00572-014-0592-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.958237622288427,TRUE,2,2,Low,not colonized,observed,"only moderate levels of endophyte associations were found across all taxa (e.g., most Poaceae were not colonized by endophytes despite numerous accounts of colonization by AMF and DSEs).

In order to reach a consensus for how DSE influence plant performance, meta-analyses were performed on data from 18 research articles, in which plants had been inoculated with DSE in sterile substrates. Negative effects of DSE on plant performance were not recorded. Positive effects were identified on total, shoot and root biomass, and on shoot nitrogen (N) and phosphorus contents, with increases of 26-103% in these parameters for plants inoculated with DSE, relative to uninoculated controls. Inoculation increased total, shoot and root biomass by 52-138% when plants had not been supplied with additional inorganic N, or when all, or the majority, of N was supplied in organic form. Inoculation with the DSE Phialocephala fortinii was found to increase shoot and root biomass, shoot P concentration and shoot N content by 44-116%, relative to uninoculated controls.

The highest count and frequency in T. aestivum were recorded for Fusarium subglutinans (n = 81 and Rf = 34.91%) followed by DSSM (n = 32 and Rf = 13.79%). In vitro DSSM studies showed the highest antagonistic activity of 56.52% reduction against A. petrakii, while F. subglutinans inhibited F. semitectum by 72.97%. These two endophytic isolates were then selected as fungal bioagents to control root rot disease in wheat caused by A. petrakii and F. semitectum under greenhouse conditions. Wheat plants growing from seeds inoculated with DSSM were more resistant to root rot disease in soil infected with A. petrakii, and they showed reduced root rot severity percentage (15.56%) and disease index (0.27) compared to the values of 40% and 1.13, respectively, for these parameters in untreated plants. Furthermore, treatment of seeds with F. subglutinans before planting in soil infected with F. semitectum reduced the disease severity percentage and the disease index from 50% and 2.20 to 20% and 0.47, respectively. These endophytic fungi also markedly increased the growth parameters (length, fresh weight, and dry weight of shoots and roots) of wheat plants growing in soils infected with these phytopathogens. The present study showed that wheat is a promising ecological niche for different fungal endophytes that assist their host plants to survive and resist the harmful effects of phytopathogenic fungi, improve wheat growth, and develop fungal strains as biological control solutions against wheat diseases. © 2020, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry.

To investigate the combined control effects of endophytic bacteria in different growth stages of cotton on Verticillium wilt, antagonistic bacteria Paenibacillus xylanilyticus YUPP-1, Paenibacillus polymyxa YUPP-8 and Bacillus subtilis YUPP-2 were isolated from cotton in the seedling, squaring and boll-setting stages, respectively. Assessment of colonization showed that strains YUPP-1, YUPP-8 and YUPP-2 had the highest populations in the seedling, squaring and boll-setting period, respectively. Indoor pot experiment indicated that cotton plants in the combined biocontrol bacteria treatment group were not infected before squaring stage, while infection rates of cotton treated with a single strain in the seedling period were 6.7% (strain YUPP-8), 6.7% (strain YUPP-1) and 13.3% (strain YUPP-2). However, infection rate of the control plants reached 80%.

We tested the hypothesis that hybridization of microbial symbionts of plants can negatively affect performance of herbivores and their natural enemies. In addition, we studied the effects of hybridization of these symbionts on feeding preference of herbivores and their natural enemies. We used Arizona fescue as the host-plant, Neotyphodium endophytes as symbionts, the bird cherry-oat aphid as the herbivore and the pink spotted ladybird beetle as the predator in controlled experiments. Neither endophyte infection (infected or not infected) nor hybrid status (hybrid and non-hybrid infection) affected aphid reproduction, proportion of winged forms in the aphid populations, aphid host-plant preference or body mass of the ladybirds. However, development of ladybird larvae was delayed when fed with aphids grown on hybrid (H+) endophyte infected grasses compared to larvae fed with aphids from non-hybrid (NH+) infected grasses, non-hybrid, endophyte-removed grasses (NH-) and hybrid, endophyte-removed (H-) grasses. Furthermore, adult beetles were more likely to choose all other types of grasses harboring aphids rather than H+ infected grasses. In addition, development of ladybirds was delayed when fed with aphids from naturally uninfected (E-) grasses compared to ladybirds that were fed with aphids from NH+ and NH- grasses.

791,The Promotion of Dark Septate Endophytes on the Performance and Active Ingredients Accumulation of Dendranthema morifolium Under Cd Stress,"Dark septate endophytes (DSE) may facilitate plant growth and stress tolerance in stressful ecosystems. However, little is known about the response of medicinal plants to DSE, especially under heavy metal stress. This study aimed to investigate how DSE affects the growth of Dendranthema morifolium in medicinal plants under cadmium (Cd) stress. In this investigation, the sterile and non-sterile inoculations were carried out to evaluate the effect of three DSE strains on D. morifolium stressed with Cd. For the root, DSE15 sterile or non-sterile inoculation resulted in enhanced root biomass, root volume, the Cd content of roots, and the indoleacetic acid (IAA) levels in D. morifolium under Cd stress. DSE7 non-sterile inoculation significantly enhanced the Cd content of roots at 1 and 5 mg Cd/kg soil. Regarding impact stems and leaves, under sterile conditions, DSE7 and DSE15 effectively regulated the shoot biomass, plant height, chlorophyll level, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) content. Under sterile conditions, DSE15 positively influenced shoot biomass and plant height, while DSE7 had no significant effect on them when subjected to Cd stress. For effects on flowers under non-sterile conditions, DSE7 and DSE15 significantly increased the flower biomass under Cd stress, while DSE7 reduced the Cd transfer coefficient of flowers at 1 and 5 mg Cd/kg soil. Importantly, at 1 mg Cd/kg soil, DSE7 and DSE15 non-sterile inoculations promoted the 1, 5-dicaffeoylquinic acid content by 18.29% and 21.70%. The interaction between DSE and soil factors revealed that DSE species had significant effects on soil organic carbon and available nitrogen in D. morifolium non-sterile soil.

12455,Effect of the fungus Piriformospora indica on physiological characteristics and root morphology of wheat under combined drought and mechanical stresses,"This study was done to evaluate the effects of the root-colonizing endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica on wheat growth under combined drought and mechanical stresses. Inoculated (colonized) and non-inoculated (uncolonized) wheat (Triticum aestivum I,. cv. Chamran) seedlings were planted in growth chambers filled with moist sand (at a matric suction of 20 hPa). Slight, moderate and severe mechanical stresses (i.e., penetration resistance, Qp, of 1.17, 4.17 and 5.96 MPa, respectively) were produced by a dead-load technique (i.e., placing a weight on the sand surface) in the root medium. Slight, moderate and severe drought stresses were induced using PEG 6000 solutions with osmotic potentials of 0, 0.3 and 0.5 MPa, respectively. After 30 days, plant physiological characteristics and root morphology were measured. An increase in Qp from 1.17 to 5.96 MPa led to greater leaf proline concentration and root diameter, and lower relative water content (RWC), leaf water potential (LWP), chlorophyll contents and root volume. Moreover, severe drought stress decreased root and shoot fresh weights, root volume, leaf area, RWC, LWP and chlorophyll content compared to control. Catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities under severe drought stress were about 1.5 and 2.9 times greater than control. Interaction of the stresses showed that mechanical stress primarily controls plant water status and physiological responses. However, endophyte presence mitigated the adverse effects of individual and combined stresses on plant growth. Colonized plants were better adapted and had greater root length and volume, RWC, LWP and chlorophyll contents under stressful conditions due to higher absorption sites for water and nutrients. Compared with uncolonized plants, colonized plants showed lower CAT activity implying that wheat inoculated with P. indica was more tolerant and experienced less oxidative damage induced by drought and/or mechanical stress.

1199,Consequences of simultaneous interactions of fungal endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi with a shared host grass,"Plants simultaneously associate with multiple microbial symbionts throughout their lifetimes. To address the question of whether the effects of simultaneous symbionts are contingent on the specific identities, we conducted a greenhouse experiment manipulating the presence and identities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and fungal endophytes on the shared host grass Elymus hystrix. Each plant host was inoculated with one of two AMF species having varying effects on host growth, or a sterile soil control. Further, we used naturally occurring endophyte-infected (E+) and uninfected (E) individuals from two populations of the endophyte Epichloe elymi that varied in their interaction with E. hystrix. We then measured responses of plants, AMF, and fungal endophytes. Overall, we found that the combined effects of AMF and fungal endophytes on plant growth were additive, reflecting the mutualistic quality of each symbiont independently interacting with host plants. However, fungal endophyte infection differentially altered hyphal colonization of the two AMF species and the identity of the coinfecting AMF species affected fungal endophyte fitness traits. The results of this study demonstrate that the outcome of interspecific symbiotic interactions varies with partner identity such that the effects of simultaneous symbioses can not be generalized.","Larimer, AL; Bever, JD; Clay, K",OIKOS,2012,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.20153.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.856674325874688,TRUE,2,2,Low,sterile,sterile,"inoculated with one of two AMF species having varying effects on host growth, or a sterile soil control.

1407,DSE enhances fungal modularity and bacterial connectivity linking rhizospheric responses to licorice growth and drought resistance,"To reveal how external fungi interact with rhizosphere community to response plant growth and drought stress, dark septate endophytes (DSE) were introduced to licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch.) that was grown in non-sterile soils subjected to drought. Four of six DSE species displayed physiological drought tolerance and positively affected growth of licorice depended on DSE species and water availability. DSE promoted the root length most obviously under drought stress (36.8-159.9 %), consequently increasing content of glycyrrhizic acid and glycyrrhizin (105.7-1473.6 %). However, the changes of ingredients were directly related to germplasm. Alterations in growth and medicinal components can be elucidated by shifts in microbial communities. DSE inoculation led to the enrichment of various microbial taxa resulting in modifications of community composition. However, changes in microbial networks were more affected by drought, with a more modularity of fungal network, while bacterial exhibited clustering, connectivity, and interspecific interactions. DSE inoculation altered soil pH, as well as levels of soil organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, which were highly corresponded to microbial community. These findings underscore the capacity of exogenous microbes to modulate rhizosphere soil community and geodynamic cycle, improve plant growth and drought resistance, offering valuable insights for managing microbial communities in dryland medicinal plant cultivation.","Zuo, YL; He, C; Yang, XR; Li, WY; He, XL",RHIZOSPHERE,2025,10.1016/j.rhisph.2025.101116,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991635210911204,TRUE,2,2,Low,sterile,sterile,NA,NA,culture_absence,culture_methods

To examine the potential importance of phyllosphere microbes on non-disease related plant traits, we used sterile Arabidopsis clones to test the effects of foliar fungi on flowering phenology and reproductive allocation under conditions of varying water stress. We inoculated the sterile plants with fully-factorial combinations of four fungal isolates, then measured flowering time and reproductive allocation for each treatment group under normal and water-stressed conditions. All plants inoculated with foliar fungi had significantly later flowering and greater seed mass than the sterile control groups. The magnitude of this effect depended on the specific fungi present, but individual fungal effects diminished as inoculum richness increased.

10212,COPPER AND NICKEL POLLUTION - FREQUENCY OF ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI IN SCOTS PINE SHOOTS AND ENDOPHYTE GROWTH IN-VITRO,"The frequency of endophytic microfungi was measured from current-year shoots of Scots pine trees growing in Harjavalta, a heavily polluted area in western Finland. The copper (Cu) and (Ni) concentrations in bark plus phloem and needles of the same trees were measured. The frequency of isolates of endophytic taxa were either negatively (Hormonema sp. 2 and Sterile sp. 1) or positively (Hormonema sp. 1, BL132) correlated with the Cu and Ni concentration of bark plus phloem. Isolates of the most common endophytic taxa and the pathogenic Gremmeniella abietina from Harjavalta were grown in vitro in different levels of Cu (0.6-126 mu g/mL) and Ni (0.3 -50 mu g/mL) separately and in combination. This experiment included also isolates of G. abietina and Hormonema sp. I from the northern (unpolluted) area. The concentrations of Cu and Ni that reduced the linear growth to 50% of control were estimated. The endophyte taxa with positively correlated frequency with increasing concentration of Cu and Ni in the shoots were able to withstand elevated levels of Cu and Ni in vitro.

9578,ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI FROM THE MYCORRHIZAE OF ALPINE ERICOID PLANTS,"Strains of a slow-growing, sterile, darkly pigmented fungus were obtained from alpine mycorrhizae of the Alberta Rocky Mountains.

Axenic cultures of Menziesia ferruginea (Ericaceae) seedlings were grown with P. fortinii for characterization of the fungus-root association. Typically, dark, simple septate hyphae form extensive wefts on the root surface and produce intracortical sclerotia of compact, darkly pigmented and irregularly lobed, thick-walled hyphae. Intracellular coils are not produced. This association differs from the ericoid mycorrhizal type and represents a fungus-root association that is common in alpine plants. In addition, several isolates of Oidiodendron griseum, a species previously reported from mycorrhizae of ericaceous plants, were found to form intracellular coils within the cortical root cells of Loiseleuria procumbens (Ericaceae).","STOYKE, G; CURRAH, RS",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE,1991,10.1139/b91-047,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.975974619327081,TRUE,2,2,Low,sterile,sterile,NA,NA,culture_absence,culture_methods

Fruit from the multiple application treatment had a storage life of up to 8 weeks (7 weeks at 1-4 degrees C plus 1 week at simulated retail temperatures of 20-21 degrees C), whereas the commercially-managed fruits (two mildewcides) were extensively colonized by fungi and extensively decayed when stored under the same conditions. Stringent post-harvest disinfection did not significantly reduce postharvest decay, and only slightly reduced isolation frequency of fungi.

2993,Disentangling the structure and function of mycoplankton communities in the context of marine environmental heterogeneity,"Mycoplankton are a diverse and ubiquitous component of marine environments with a suggested role in ocean biogeochemical cycling. Thus far, the patterns of their abundance, structure, and function against spatial environmental heterogeneity remains poorly understood. Based on in silico and experimental evaluation of multiple markers, we adopted the ITS1 region to determine the composition, guilds, and metabolic potential of mycoplankton communities in contrasting marine environments. The trophic status of estuarine (SB1 and SB2) and coastal (DB1 and DB2) sites, but not oceanic (OS) site, was the major factor that determined their abundances. While ascomycetous fungi dominated the estuarine and coastal sites, basidiomycetous fungi were found to dominate the oceanic site. The zoosporic fungi were relatively more abundant in SB1 and DB2 sites compared to the other sites. The relative abundances of the core fungi, namely Cystobasidium, Phlebia, Rhodotorula, Trichoderma, Alternaria, Penicillium, Malassezia, and Aspergillus varied widely across the sites. Additionally, several fungal genera unique to each site were also identified. DB2 site exhibited the lowest fungal richness while the OS site the highest. Conversely, the diversity and evenness were the lowest for the OS site but highest for the SB1 site. Temperature, pH, and chlorophyll-a were strongly associated with spatial diversity patterns. Of the 11 assigned guilds, some guilds particularly were not detected, including plant pathogen-wood saprotroph in DB2, the endophyte-plant pathogen in OS, the animal pathogen in SB1, and fungal parasite in DB1 and SB2. Within core functions-metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates and energy, fatty acids and lipids, nitrogen, sulfur, and other compounds-several pathways showed spatial variations. Overall, this study not just broadens the taxonomic and metabolic repertoire of marine mycoplankton but also provides the first evidence of how these are shaped by site-scale environmental heterogeneity.

3435,Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi: some new perspectives on old acquaintances,"Many ericaceous species colonize as pioneer plants substrates ranging from arid sandy soils to moist mor humus, in association with their mycorrhizal fungi. Thanks to the symbiosis with ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, ericaceous plants are also able to grow in highly polluted environments, where metal ions can reach toxic levels in the soil substrate. For a long time this mycorrhizal type has been regarded as an example of a highly specific interaction between plants and fungi. More recent studies have been challenging this view because some ericoid mycorrhizal endophytes seem also able to colonise plants from very distant taxa. A molecular approach has allowed the investigation of genetic diversity and molecular ecology of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi, and has revealed that ericaceous plants can be very promiscuous, with multiple occupancy of their thin roots. The molecular analysis of sterile morphotypes involved in this symbiosis has also led to deeper understanding of the species diversity of ericoid fungi. Genetic polymorphism of ericoid fungi is wider than previously thought, and often increased by the presence of Group I introns in the nuclear small subunit rDNA.","Perotto, S; Girlanda, M; Martino, E",PLANT AND SOIL,2002,10.1023/A:1020289401610,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.978795592672098,TRUE,2,2,Low,sterile,sterile,"can be very promiscuous, with multiple occupancy of their thin roots.

As a result of their roles in nutrient cycling and plant diversity, plant-soil interactions should be a major focus of ecological studies on lignin-modified plants. However, most studies have been decomposition studies conducted in a single soil or in sterile soil. Thus, we understand little about plant-soil interactions in living lignin-modified plants. In lignin mutants of three different barley (Hordeum vulgare) cultivars and their corresponding wild-types associated with three different soil microbial communities, we asked: do plant-soil microbiome interactions influence the lignin content of plants?; does a mutation in lignin production alter the outcome of plant-soil microbiome interactions?; does the outcome of plant-soil microbiome interactions depend on host genotype or the presence of a mutation altering lignin production? In roots, the soil community explained 6% of the variation in lignin content, but, in shoots, the soil community explained 21% of the variation in lignin content and was the only factor influencing lignin content. Neither genotype nor mutations in lignin production explained associations with fungi. Lignin content changes in response to a plant's soil microbial community, and may be a defensive response to particular components of the soil community.","Bennett, AE; Grussu, D; Kam, J; Caul, S; Halpin, C",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,2015,10.1111/nph.13171,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,0.702701194856995,TRUE,2,2,Low,sterile,sterile,"plants.

Five and 6 years after planting, morphological characterization and molecular typing techniques (internal transcribed spacer - restriction fragment length polymorphism (ITS-RFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers) were used to identify the ectomycorrhizal fungal communities and to assess the occurrence of the inoculated ectomycorrhizal fungi on host roots. Ectomycorrhizae recovered from the roots of the planted trees on each of the two sites showed little diversity, with a total of 16 and 19 ITS-RFLP patterns corresponding to 11 and 13 ectomycorrhizal taxa, respectively. The most abundant ectomycorrhizal fungi found on colonized roots were ascomycetes and the widespread basidiomycete Amphinema byssoides.

The ability to establish themselves as beneficial endophytes provides a sound ground for their exploitation in crop production and protection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the entomopathogenic strains of Beauveria bas- siana and Mertarhizium anisopliae for their potential to colonize cucumber plants under natural environmental conditions in non-sterile substrate. Seed submersion in conidial suspension resulted in systemic colonization of cucumber plants 28 days post-inoculation. Scanning electron microscope micrographs demonstrated that conidia of both fungal genera have adhered, germinated and directly penetrated seed epidermal cells 24 hr post -submersion. Treated with EPF cucumber seeds resulted seedlings tissues of which contained a significantly higher amount of total phenolic compounds and unchanged amounts of chlorophylls. There was a significant negative effect of endophytic colonization on the Aphis gossypii population size after 5 days of exposure as well as a positive effect on cucumber growth and development 7 weeks post-inoculation. We suggest that reduction of A. gossypii population on mature Cucumis sativus plants is caused via an endophyte-triggered improvement of plant's physiological parameters such as enhanced plant growth with subsequent increase in plant resistance through augmented production of phenolic compounds.","Shaalan, RS; Gerges, E; Habib, W; Ibrahim, L",JOURNAL OF PLANT PROTECTION RESEARCH,2021,10.24425/jppr.2021.139244,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.971022590737394,TRUE,2,2,Low,sterile,sterile,NA,NA,culture_absence,culture_methods
2441,In vitro interactions between yeasts and bacteria and the fungal symbionts of the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae),"Multi-trophic interactions between prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes, and ecologically intertwined metazoans are presumably common in nature, yet rarely described. The mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae, is associated with two filamentous fungi, Grosmannia clavigera and Ophiostoma montium. Other microbes, including yeasts and bacteria, are also present in the phloem, but it is not known whether they interact with the symbiotic fungi or the host beetle. To test whether such interactions occur, we performed a suite of in vitro assays. Overall, relative yield of O. montium grown with microbes isolated from larval galleries was significantly greater than when the fungus was grown alone. Conversely, the yield of G. clavigera grown with these same microbes was less than or equal to when it was grown alone, suggesting that O. montium, and at least some microbes in larval galleries, have a mutualistic or commensal relationship, while G. clavigera and those same microbes have an antagonistic relationship. A bacterium isolated from phloem not colonized by beetles was found to inhibit growth of both G. clavigera and O. montium and appears to be an antagonist to both fungi.

3981,Enhanced removal of heavy metals by wetland plant-microbiome symbiont: Prospect of potential strategies and mechanisms for environmental heavy metal regulation,"Wetland plants and their related environmental interfaces are colonized by a wide range of microbial communities, and the symbiotic system of plants and microorganisms can interact and cooperate with each other, playing an important role in environmental remediation of metal pollution, which has garnered significant attention. The dominant communities of wetland plants still have high treatment performance and survival rate under pollution conditions. Many studies show that hyperaccumulating metallophytes have the capacity to accumulate heavy metal up to several times higher than the plants in sterile soil, due to the interaction of microbes within the rhizosphere. Thus, biotechnological efforts are being explored to modify plants for heavy metal phytoremediation and to improve the adaptation of wetland plants, endophytes, and rhizospheric microorganisms to adverse environment. New phytoremediation techniques and enhanced symbiosis technique for endophytic bacteria inoculation with high efficiency are being pursued and utilized in heavy metal phytoremediation in wetland systems. Therefore, in this review, we systematically summarized the interface characteristics of wetland systems and the interaction of symbionts, with emphasis on the enhanced removal potential and regulation mechanisms of heavy metals by plant-microbe symbiosis in wetland systems, along with the applications of plant-microbiomes for heavy metal remediation in wetlands. Moreover, we explored the remediation mechanisms of combined endogenic-ecophytic microorganisms for wetland systems. In recent research, the exogeneous bacteria drastically remodeled the rhizospheric microbiome and further improved the activity of rhizospheric functional enzymes, with the metal removal at the rhizospheric region reaching up to 95%.

16137,Virulence of the endophytic fungus Trichoderma asperellum against larvae of Spodoptera frugiperda J. E. Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae),"Spodoptera frugiperda JE Smith, known as the fall armyworm (FAW), is a major pest of maize crops. This bug damages maize plant leaves, leading to yield declines of up to 79.9%. An alternative approach to controlling S. frugiperda entails the use of entomopathogenic fungi. Many entomopathogenic fungi are present, including Trichoderma asperellum, which resides endophytically within plants. This study aims to evaluate the pathogenicity of T. asperellum in controlling S. frugiperda larvae. Five isolates of T. asperellum (A116, PC21, S2D11, SD34, and AB2B3) were procured from various plant tissues. Two milliliters of conidia suspension, with a concentration of 10^8 conidia/ml, and sterile distilled water as a control were supplied to S. frugiperda larvae. The measured variables encompassed the mortality rate of S. frugiperda larvae, the percentage of pupae that matured, and the percentage of adults that emerged. The results demonstrated that the endophytic fungus T. asperellum can eradicate S. frugiperda larvae. The mortality rate of S. frugiperda larvae ranged from 34.67% to 57.33%. The utilization of T. asperellum on S. frugiperda led to a 44.00% reduction in pupae formation and a 36.00% reduction in adult formation. T. asperellum S2D11 is the most efficacious isolate for infecting S. frugiperda larvae. © 2025, Crop Protection Research Centre.

2047,The Promotion of Dark Septate Endophytes on the Performance and Active Ingredients Accumulation of Astragalus mongholicus under Cadmium Stress,"Dark septate endophytes (DSE) commonly inhabit the root systems of plants that flourish in heavy metal-contaminated soils. Nevertheless, there is limited understanding regarding the overall response of medicinal plants to DSE under heavy metal stress. The present study utilized a non-sterile pot experiment to evaluate the beneficial impacts of DSE (Paraphoma chlamydocopiosa, Paraboeremia selaginellae, and Paraphoma radicina) inoculation on Astragalus mongholicus under cadmium (Cd) stress. At 0 mg Cd/kg soil, inoculation with DSE led to a significant increase in the total biomass of the host plant by up to 34.0%. Although plant biomass decreased at 5 mg Cd/kg soil and 10 mg Cd/kg soil, the total biomass of the host plant increased by up to 72.3% after DSE inoculation. The plant height, branch number, soil and plant analyzer development (SPAD) value, and biomass were not affected by Cd concentration after inoculation with P. chlamydocopiosa and P. selaginellae. DSE emerged as the most prominent explanatory variable (44.2%) for plant growth at 10 mg Cd/kg soil. Inoculation with P. chlamydocopiosa increased root length by 47.9% and root biomass by 74.1%, and inoculation with P. chlamydocopiosa and P. selaginellae increased the indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content by 103.6% and 105.8%, respectively, at 10 mg Cd/kg soil. Additionally, P. radicina inoculation was preferred to increase the content of calycosin-7-O-glucoside, while P. chlamydocopiosa increased the content of formononetin. DSE enhanced the accumulation of Cd in the shoot, whereas P. radicina exhibited an inhibitory effect on Cd accumulation in the root system. P. chlamydocopiosa decreased the Cd translocation factor, while P. radicina increased the Cd translocation factor, which exceeded one. The interaction between DSE and soil factors significantly contributed to the host plant growth. DSE inoculation improved soil organic carbon content and inoculation with P. chlamydocopiosa, and P. selaginellae reduced available nitrogen content, regardless of the Cd stress. DSE inoculation reduced available phosphorus content at 10 mg Cd/kg soil. Importantly, P. radicina promote the performance and calycosin-7-O-glucoside accumulation of the host plant, and reduced Cd content in the roots at 5 mg Cd/kg soil. These data enhanced comprehension of the ecological function of DSE in heavy metal-contaminated soils and demonstrated the potential utility of DSE strains for cultivating medicinal plants.","Li, M; Han, L; He, C; Li, X; He, XL",AGRONOMY-BASEL,2024,10.3390/agronomy14081801,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.952154979686586,TRUE,2,2,Low,sterile,sterile,NA,NA,culture_absence,culture_methods

The results indicated that the total nitrogen, total phosphorus, crude protein (CP), crude fat (CF), crude ash (CA) contents, and DM of F. sinensis decreased with the repeated cutting increase and reached the minimum after the third time cut. The total organic carbon content of F. sinensis peaked at the second time cut. In addition, the DM of F. sinensis was significant (P < 0.05) positively correlated with its quality CP, CF, and CA contents, and the appropriate repeated cutting times of F. sinensis was 1-2 times.

The aim of this study was to increase the speed and accuracy of Cladosporium spp. spore counting using UV-visible spectrophotometry based on the regression model in a water suspension. Spores of C. ramotenellum AM55, C. limoniforme Br15, C. tenuissimum K15 and C. cladosporioides Ld13 fungi were diluted in sterile distilled water several times. Spore concentration/ml (SC) was counted with a hemocytometer. The spectrophotometer visible light absorption (ABS) was measured under 14 wavelengths from 300 to 950 nm for each dilution. The results showed that the morphological variation of the spores greatly affect the determination of the suitable wavelength. 650, 750, 500 and 400 nm wavelengths had the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) values respectively for C. ramotenellum AM55, C. limoniforme Br15, C. tenuissimum K15 and C. cladosporioides Ld13 on the linear regression model. R-2 values were 0.9874, 0.9647, 0.8856 and 0.9711 respectively, for the 650, 750, 500 and 400 nm wavelengths. The linear equation of SC = 10(7) x ABS-133,040 with the highest R-2 value of 0.9532 had the best fit under a combinatorial regression model where SC and ABS of all Cladosporium spp. were presented.

1410,Effects of the Fungal Endophyte Epichloe festucae var. lolii on Growth and Physiological Responses of Perennial Ryegrass cv. Fairway to Combined Drought and Pathogen Stresses,"Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) is widely cultivated around the world for turf and forage. However, the plant is highly susceptible to disease and is sensitive to drought. The present study aims to determine the effect of the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae var. lolii of perennial ryegrass on the combined stresses of drought and disease caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana in the greenhouse. In the experiment, plants infected (E+) or not infected (E-) with the fungal endophyte were inoculated with Bipolaris sorokiniana and put under different soil water regimes (30%, 50%, and 70%). The control treatment consisted of E+ and E- plants not inoculated with B. sorokiniana. Plant growth, phosphorus (P) uptake, photosynthetic parameters, and other physiological indices were evaluated two weeks after pathogen infection. The fungal endophyte in E+ plants increased P uptake, plant growth, and photosynthetic parameters but decreased the malondialdehyde concentration, proline content, and disease incidence of perennial ryegrass (p < 0.05). E+ plants had the lowest disease incidence at 70% soil water (p < 0.05).

16319,Effects of the Epichloë gansuensis endophyte on the physiological status of Achnatherum inebrians under different nitrogen concentrations; [缺 氮 条 件 下 内 生 真 菌 对 醉 马 草 生 理 特 性 的 影 响],Nitrogen is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development，and endophytic fungi can influence nitrogen metabolism in the host. The endophyte Epichloë gansuensis forms a symbiotic relationship with Achnatherum inebrians，also known as drunken horse grass. The effect of endophytic fungi on the host’s nitrogen metabolism is dependent on the surrounding nitrogen concentrations. In this study，A. inebrians plants infected with the Epichloë gansuensis endophyte（E+）or not infected（E −）were grown under low（0. 01 mmol·L–1 N）and normal（7. 5 mmol·L–1 N）nitrogen levels for 6 months. The harvested materials were analyzed to determine leaf dry weight，hydrogen peroxide （H2O2） content，malondialdehyde （MDA） content，and other physiological and biochemical indices. The results revealed that：1）Under low-nitrogen conditions，compared with E− A. inebrians plants，E+ A. inebrians plants showed significantly increased plant height，dry weight，tiller number，glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase （G6PDH） activity，reduced glutathione （GSH） content，and nitrogen content，and significantly decreased MDA and H2O2 contents. However，the carbon（C）and phosphorus（P）leaf contents，and the C∶N，C∶P，and N∶P ratios in the plants did not differ significantly between the E+ and E− plants. 2）Under normal-N conditions，compared with E − plants，E+ plants showed significantly increased plant height，but no significant difference in dry weight，tiller number，MDA and H2O2 contents，and GSH and G6PDH activity. Taken together，these findings suggest that E. gansuensis infection can enhance the growth of A. inebrians under low-nitrogen conditions by increasing G6PDH activity and GSH content，reducing H2O2 and MDA content，and promoting nitrogen uptake，thereby increasing leaf dry weight and tiller numbers. However，the impact of E. gansuensis on A. inebrians plants under normal N levels is limited. © 2024 Editorial Office of Acta Prataculturae Sinica.

Colonization by P. indica exhibited distinctive drought defensive effects characterized by the enhanced production of proline, which contributed to improved plant resilience to drought stress, alleviating the harmful oxidative stress. In colonized plants that were under extremely severe stress, proline levels in leaf tissues rose by 18% during panicle initiation (PI) and by 21% during the flowering stage, compared to the uninoculated plants. P. indica colonization also enhanced the relative leaf water content and cell membrane stability in plants. Under extremely severe stress, colonized plants displayed improved cell membrane stability (57% and 48%) at PI and flowering, representing 29% and 8% improvement, respectively, over the non-colonized plants under stress. Endophyte colonized plants demonstrated increased resistance to drought stress with enhanced chlorophyll stability when compared to stressed plants that were not colonized.

Ramets of infected (+E) and noninfected (-E) genotypes of Lolium perenne cv. Yorktown III were glasshouse grown for 12 wk after which all plants were defoliated. Half the plants were harvested for total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) analysis, the remainder grew for an additional 4 wk before harvesting. Effects of endophyte infection on tiller numbers, leaf area and TNC were highly dependent on host genotype at the time of defoliation. Leaf mass, tiller base mass, and specific leaf area after regrowth were highly dependent on genotype by endophyte interactions. Regrowth rates were influenced by host genotype, but not by endophytes. Leaf area regrowth rate was negatively correlated with TNC across genotypes, but only in -E plants. The marked host genotype-endophyte infection interactions detected in this L. perenne population indicates that, for many growth and storage traits, endophyte infection can impact microevolutionary change.

3188,Endophytic Colonization by the Entomopathogenic Fungus Beauveria Bassiana Affects Plant Volatile Emissions in the Presence or Absence of Chewing and Sap-Sucking Insects,"Entomopathogenic fungi are gaining acceptance in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) systems as effective and environmental safety biological control agents to protect a great variety of crops against pest insects. Many of these insect-pathogenic fungi can establish themselves as endophytes and thereby may induce the plant immune system. The activation of plant defenses by the fungal endophytic colonization can have a direct impact on herbivores and plant pathogens. An integral component of many plant defense responses is also the release of volatile organic compounds, which may serve as an indirect defense by attracting the natural enemies of herbivores. Here we investigated the effect of endophytic colonization by the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana on the volatile emission by melon and cotton plants, either unharmed or after being damaged by sap-sucking aphids or leaf chewing caterpillars. We found that when the plants are colonized by B. bassiana they emit a different blend of volatile compounds compared to uncolonized control plants. Some of the emitted compounds have been reported previously to be released in response to herbivory and have been implicated in natural enemy attraction. Several of the compounds are also known to have antimicrobial properties. Therefore, endophytic colonization by B. bassiana might help to not only direct control insect pests but also increase the resistance of plants against agronomically important pests and phytopathogens.","González-Mas, N; Gutiérrez-Sánchez, F; Sánchez-Ortiz, A; Grandi, L; Turlings, TCJ; Muñoz-Redondo, JM; Moreno-Rojas, JM; Quesada-Moraga, E",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2021,10.3389/fpls.2021.660460,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.979686077976095,TRUE,2,1,Low,uncolonized,investigated,are colonized by B. bassiana they emit a different blend of volatile compounds compared to uncolonized control plants.

11909,Residues of thiamethoxam and mefenoxam in vegetative and floral tissue of soybean at the early reproductive stage resulting from seed treatments,"Thiamethoxam with mefenoxam is the most widely used neonicotinoid insecticide/fungicide mixture applied to soybean (Glycine max [L]) as seed treatments. Based on the systemic nature of thiamethoxam and mefenoxam, residues of this insecticide/fungicide mixture may be present in soybean vegetative and floral tissue and negatively impact beneficial insects. Although neonicotinoids are often applied in combination with systemic fungicides, the research on ecological risks of neonicotinoids has been focused on the analysis of these compounds without considering their interaction with other agrochemicals. The objective of this study was to identify the concentration of thiamethoxam and mefenoxam in soybean flowers and leaves during early reproductive soybean stages. A field experiment with three treatments: a thiamethoxam-mefenoxam combination, thiamethoxam only, and untreated seeds, was conducted. Flowers were collected during early reproductive soybean stages R1-R2 at different locations in Nebraska during two years. Quantification of the pesticides in floral tissue was conducted using a modification of the QuEChErs extraction method and HPLC-MS/MS analysis. Mean concentrations of thiamethoxam and mefenoxam in floral and vegetative tissue were exteremely low or not detected although trace levels of thiamethoxam were higher in floral tissues from seed treatments relative to the control. The only residue consistently detected above the method detection limit among plants grown from thiamethoxam treated seeds was the thiamethoxiam metabolite, clothianidin.

12704,Phytochemicals induced in chickpea roots selectively and non-selectively stimulate and suppress fungal endophytes and pathogens,"Plant roots shape the structure of the soil microbiome by producing a wide array of phytochemicals, which in turn impact plant growth and health. The synthesis of root metabolites is a dynamic process that is modulated by interactions with soil microorganisms. This study explored the regulation of soil-borne fungal endophytes and pathogens by the production of phytochemicals in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) roots colonized or not colonized by the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. Proteins and low-molecular-mass phytochemicals were extracted from chickpea roots and fractionated by flash chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The effects of these metabolites on the soil-borne fungal endophytes Trichoderma harzianum and Geomyces vinaceus and on the pathogens Fusarium oxysporum and Rhizoctonia solani were tested in 96-well plate assays. One protein fraction from the AM roots, which contained an apparent 34 KDa chitinase/chitin-binding domain and 24 KDa non-specific lipid transfer protein, non-selectively repressed the fungal endophytes and pathogens. By contrast to the protein fraction, the low-molecular-mass fractions were often selective. Eighteen fractions stimulated specific fungal species and seven fractions inhibited others. Several protein and low-molecular-mass phytochemicals in chickpea roots influence fungal endophytes. The difference in the response of fungal species to the phytochemicals suggests that these metabolites could be involved in the so called host 'preference' of fungal endophytes or 'resistance' to pathogens. This research reveals that the majority of the bioactive root metabolites could be involved in the selective association of chickpea and fungal endophytes while a few compounds provided resistance by suppressing the pathogenic species.","Bazghaleh, N; Hamel, C; Gan, YT; Knight, JD; Vujanovic, V; Cruz, AF; Ishii, T",PLANT AND SOIL,2016,10.1007/s11104-016-2977-z,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.898538138947752,TRUE,2,1,Low,not colonized,tested,and pathogens by the production of phytochemicals in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) roots colonized or not colonized by the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Rhizophagus irregularis.

10148,Drought stress responses in maize are diminished by Piriformospora indica,"As an endophytic fungus of Sebacinales, Piriformospora indica promotes plant growth and resistance to abiotic stress, including drought. Colonization of maize roots promoted the leaf size, root length and number of tap roots. Under drought stress, the maize seedlings profited from the presence of the fungus and performed visibly better than the uncolonized controls. To identify genes and biological processes involved in growth promotion and drought tolerance conferred by P. indica, the root transcriptome of colonized and uncolonized seedlings was analyzed 0, 6 and 12h after drought stress (20% polyethylene glycol 6000). The number of P. indica-responsive genes increased from 464 (no stress at 0h) to 1337 (6h drought) and 2037 (12h drought). Gene Ontology analyses showed that the carbon and sulfur metabolisms are major targets of the fungus. Furthermore, the growth promoting effect of P. indica is reflected by higher transcript levels for microtubule associated processes. Under drought stress, the fungus improved the oxidative potential of the roots, and stimulated genes for hormone functions, including those which respond to abscisic acid, auxin, salicylic acid and cytokinins. The comparative analyses of our study provides systematic insight into the molecular mechanism how P. indica promotes plant performance under drought stress, and presents a collection of genes which are specifically targeted by the fungus under drought stress in maize roots.","Zhang, WY; Wang, J; Xu, L; Wang, AA; Huang, L; Du, HW; Qiu, LJ; Oelmüller, R",PLANT SIGNALING & BEHAVIOR,2018,10.1080/15592324.2017.1414121,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.83196079590826,TRUE,2,1,Low,uncolonized,analyzed,maize seedlings profited from the presence of the fungus and performed visibly better than the uncolonized controls.

Three profiles were excavated within the deposit and samples were obtained from the 20- to 30-, 50- to 60-, and 80- to 90-cm depths. A greenhouse bioassay using jack pine [Pinus banksiana] and slender wheatgrass [Agropyron trachycaulum] demonstrated the mycorrhizal inoculum was present in the peat, though the distribution of inoculum was patchy. White ectomycorrhizal inoculum was present in all profiles and at all depths, fungi which could form mycorrhizae with slender wheatgrass were absent from one profile and did not occur in the 20- to 30-cm layer of a second. Twelve fungi formed ectomycorrhizae with jack pine including an E-strain fungus and Cenococcum geophilum. The most common jack pine symbiont was an unknown ascomycete which produced cystidial ectomycorrhizae.

12627,Enhancing rhizosphere soil water retention in wheat through colonization with endophytic fungus Serendipita indica,"Effect of S. indica colonization of wheat (Triticum aestivum) on water retention and physical quality of the rhizosphere soil was investigated in a greenhouse study. Colonized and uncolonized seedlings of four wheat cultivars (i.e., Roshan, Ghods, Pishtaz, and Kavir) were grown in rhizoboxes. Plants were harvested and intact samples were taken from the rhizosphere to measure soil organic carbon (SOC), hot-water soluble carbohydrates (HWSC), and soil water retention curve (SWRC). Water contents at field capacity (& theta;FC) and permanent wilting point (& theta;PWP), and plant available water (PAW) were obtained from the measured SWRC data. The integral energy (EI(PAW)) and integral water storage (WI(PAW)), two alternative indices of soil water availability and physical quality, were computed by integration of SWRCs over the PAW range with respect to water content and matric potential, respectively. Low EI(PAW) and high WI(PAW) indicate improved soil physical quality and better soil water availability to plant. The results showed that the SOC storage and HWSC of the wheat rhizosphere were approximately 146 and 83% greater than those of unplanted soils, respectively. Moreover, compared with the uncolonized counterparts, S. indica colonization significantly increased the SOC and HWSC by 76 and 134%, respectively. The presence of plant roots and S. indica colonization improved soil water retention by increasing SOC and HWSC and subsequently enhancing portion of structural porosity (i.e., pore space between the soil aggregates in the size range of 0.5-500 & mu;m, mainly includingmacropores and mesopores). Despite having the same PAW, colonized soil samples had lower EI(PAW) (& AP; 133 J kg- 1) compared to uncolonized counterparts (& AP; 153 J kg � 1). This finding implies that plant roots take up water from the colonized wheat-planted soils easier than from the uncolonized counterparts. Compared to uncolonized samples, an increase of 50% in S1 (Dexter's index of soil physical quality) of the colonized Kavir cultivar [with the lowest root extension, SOC (i.e., 0.97 g kg � 1), and HWSC (i.e., 0.059 g kg � 1)] showed that S. indica can improve soil physical quality due to greater structural pores. Among the four wheat cultivars, the rhizosphere of Roshan (& AP; 1.60 g kg � 1) and Ghods (1.61 g kg � 1) had the highest SOC values. Higher HWSC (i.e., 0.138 g kg � 1) and more extensive root distribution for Roshan, especially upon co-cultivation with S. indica, led to greater contribution of structural pores in water retention in the rhizosphere soil when compared with three other cultivars. To conclude, S. indica colonization not only in the presence of plant roots and by increasing SOC and HWSC improves the physical quality of the rhizosphere soil but also the fungus by itself enhances soil physical quality due to enhancing portion of structural porosity involving in water transition and storage.","Hosseini, F; Mosaddeghi, MR; Zarebanadkouki, M",RHIZOSPHERE,2023,10.1016/j.rhisph.2023.100709,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.906088610975671,TRUE,2,1,Low,uncolonized,investigated,"and physical quality of the rhizosphere soil was investigated in a greenhouse study.

6253,Endophytic fungi and silica content of different bamboo species in giant panda diet,"The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), one of the most threatened mammalian species in the world, has adapted to herbivorous diet consisting mainly of bamboo (Poaceae: Bambusoidea). The most acute threats to the survival of the giant panda are habitat loss and fragmentation. However, changes in habitat may influence also the quality of giant panda diet through the bamboo species composition as well as their symbiotic leaf endophytes and plant chemical properties. Here we explore species composition and frequency of endophytic fungi and silica content in different bamboo species in the range of giant panda habitat in relation to panda food preference. Silica content of the bamboos varied from 3.7 g/kg to 45.7 g/kg and did not correlate with panda preference and altitudinal gradient. Systemic and vertically in seeds transmitted fungal endophytes or bacterial endophytes were not detected in bamboo leaves. Nearly half of the identified endophytic fungi belonged to genus Arthrinium. Pandas preferred bamboo species naturally occurring in higher altitudes. Furthermore, the total amount of endophytes tended to be lower in samples collected from bamboos in higher altitudes.

6866,Inhibition of plant pathogenic fungi by endophytic Trichoderma spp. through mycoparasitism and volatile organic compounds,"Antagonism of plant pathogenic fungi by endophytic fungi is a well-known phenomenon. In plate assays, the antagonism could be due to mycoparasitism, competition for space or antibiosis, involving a chemical diffusate, or a volatile organic compound (VOC). In this study, we demonstrate that besides mycoparasitism, VOCs play a major role in antagonism of pathogenic fungi by four endophytic fungi belonging to the genus Trichoderma. Using a double-plate assay, we show that all the four endophytic Trichoderma species significantly inhibited mycelial growth of three of the four pathogens, (Sclerotinia sclerotiorum-TSS, Sclerotium rolfsii-CSR and Fusarium oxysporum-CFO), while that of Macrophomina phaseolina-CMP was not affected. GC-MS analysis of the pure cultures of one of the endophytic fungi studied, namely, Trichoderma longibrachiatum strain 2 (Acc. No. MK751758) and the pathogens, F. oxysporum-CFO and M. phaseolina-CMP revealed the presence of several VOCs including hydrocarbons, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters, acids, ethers and different classes of terpenes. In mixed double plates, where the endophyte was grown along with either of the two plant pathogens, F. oxysporum-CFO or M. phaseolina-CMP, there was an induction of a number of new VOCs that were not detected in the pure cultures of either the endophyte or the pathogens.

2928,Alien fungal species on asymptomatic live woody plant material imported into Canada,"Undescribed exotic and scientifically unknown fungal species with the potential to be pathogens are often difficult to detect on imported live plant material due to their inconspicuous nature and thus represent an important risk to Canadian forests. We have developed an early warning method based on a random sampling of asymptomatic woody live plant material imported into Canada to detect such potential alien fungal species. We received 150 asymptomatic sample lots collected by Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) inspectors. Samples were analysed by cloning and sequencing the PCR-amplified fungal nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) DNA from plant tissues to reveal fungal diversity. Out of 1845 fungal clones obtained, 267 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified. Using phylogenetic profiling methods, two fungal OTUs were categorized as having potential for a moderate impact on Canadian forests, 37 OTUs had a low impact and 18 OTUs could not be assessed given their low genetic similarity with other ITS sequences in GenBank. In all cases, the potential risk associated with these 57 fungal OTUs is based on (i) the fact that they can be considered unknown species to science; and (ii) they belong to orders, classes, genera and families in which pathogenic species are common. Fungal introductions with potential for a moderate impact on Canadian forests were observed at a very low frequency (0.2%) in the sampling units (clones). Only 1.3% of the CFIA samples had an OTU with a potential moderate impact on Canadian forests and 74% of the samples were free of fungal OTUs that could have any potential impact. This early warning method sheds light on the suite of exotic fungi that may enter Canada via plant material. Additionally, this method provides the tools to assess the potential risk that these fungi may post to Canadian trees and determines the magnitude of asymptomatic material that harbours fungal pathogens.","Bérubé, JA; Nicolas, GG",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY,2015,10.1080/07060661.2014.986526,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992708537927525,TRUE,1,14,Low,low frequency,pcr; amplified; sequencing; cloning; ITS; observed; assessed; collected,introductions with potential for a moderate impact on Canadian forests were observed at a very low frequency (0.2%) in the sampling units (clones).

Although endophytic fungi and bacteria associated with rice have been investigated, little is known about the endophytic fungi of wild rice (Oryza granulate) in China. Here we studied the root endophytic mycobiota residing in roots of O. granulate by the use of an integrated approach consisting of microscopy, cultivation, ecological indices, and direct PCR. Microscopy confirmed the ubiquitousness of dark septate endophytes (DSEs) and sclerotium-like structures in root tissues. Isolations from 204 root segments from 15 wild rice plants yielded 58 isolates, for which 31 internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-based genotypes were recorded. The best BLAST match indicated that 34.5% of all taxa encountered may represent hitherto undescribed species. Most of the fungi were isolated with a very low frequency. Calculation of ecological indices and estimation of taxon accumulation curves indicated a high diversity of fungal species. A culture-independent approach was also performed to analyze the endophytic fungal community. Three individual clone libraries were constructed. Using a threshold of 90% similarity, 35 potentially different sequences (phylotypes) were found among 186 positive clones. Phylogenetic analysis showed that frequently detected clones were classified as Basidiomycota, and 60.2% of total analyzed clones were affiliated with unknown taxa. Exophiala, Cladophialophora, Harpophora, Periconia macrospinosa, and the Ceratobasidium/Rhizoctonia complex may act as potential DSE groups.

In this study, we used molecular phylogenetic and genotypic information to infer species diversity, reproductive potential and genetic structure of Beauveria occurring within a single arable field and bordering hedgerow in Denmark. Isolates were sampled from cultivated field and hedgerow soils, from insects harbouring latent fungal infections, and from the phylloplanes of three plant species common in the hedgerow flora.

However, little is known about their distribution patterns within forest ecosystems. We examined how species diversity and community composition of phyllosphere fungi change along a vertical structure in a tropical forest in Thailand. Fungal communities in 144 leaf samples from 19 vertical layers (1.28-34.4 m above ground) of 73 plant individuals (27 species) were investigated by metabarcoding analysis using Ion Torrent sequencing. In total, 1,524 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected among 890,710 reads obtained from the 144 leaf samples. Taxonomically diverse fungi belonging to as many as 24 orders of Ascomycota and 21 orders of Basidiomycota were detected, most of which inhabited limited parts of the lowest layers closest to the forest floor. Species diversity of phyllosphere fungi was the highest in the lowest layers closest to the forest floor, decreased with increasing height, and lowest in the canopy; 742 and 55 fungal OTUs were detected at the lowest and highest layer, respectively. On the layers close to the forest floor, phyllosphere fungal communities were mainly composed of low frequency OTUs and largely differentiated among plant individuals. Conversely, in the canopy, fungal communities consisted of similar OTUs across plant individuals, and as many as 86.1%-92.7% of the OTUs found in the canopy (>= 22 m above ground) were also distributed in the lower layers. Overall, our study showed the variability of phyllosphere fungal communities along the vertical gradient of plant vegetation and environmental conditions, suggesting the significance of biotic and abiotic variation for the species diversity of phyllosphere fungi.","Izuno, A; Kanzaki, M; Artchawakom, T; Wachrinrat, C; Isagi, Y",PLOS ONE,2016,10.1371/journal.pone.0166669,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.964812737255075,TRUE,1,6,Low,low frequency,sequencing; examined; investigated; examined,"On the layers close to the forest floor, phyllosphere fungal communities were mainly composed of low frequency OTUs and largely differentiated among plant individuals.

15751,Nano-diagnostic technique for detection of rice pathogenic fungus Pyricularia oryzae,"Rice blast caused by Pyricularia oryzae is considered as one of the most dangerous diseases in Egypt and worldwide. The fungus can infect rice plants at any growth stage. P. oryzae can be transmitted from seeds to seedlings and increase the possibilities of spreading the disease and could cause epidemics, so that blast was referred to seed-borne disease. Current investigation aimed to develop an advanced technique or procedure that would allow reliable, reasonably fast and accurate detection of dangerous seed-borne fungal diseases such as P. oryzae in rice. The most common seed health tests including washing test (WT), blotter method (BM), washing after incubation, modified (WAI), deep freezing method (DF) and potato dextrose agar method (PDA) were applied for detecting seed-borne fungi from rice seeds. Among other fungi, the blast fungus P. oryzae was recorded only for three times from rice seed samples with very low frequency values of 1.0 and 1.5 in 2015 season using WT and WAI, respectively, and 2.0 in 2016 season using WAI. PCR has many beneficial characteristics that make it highly applicable for detecting P. oryzae in seeds. So that, side by side, PCR reaction was used for detecting and identifing P. oryzae to overcome the time consuming and inacuracy of the common seed heath tests. Metallic nanoparticles, silver and iron oxide nanoparticles were also involved to enhance DNA extraction which considered an important step in the PCR technology. Silver and Iron oxide nanoparticles were able to enhance the quantity and purity of DNA template for successful PCR assay. Preferably, seed health methods should be sensitive, specific, rapid, robust, inexpensive and simple to be applicable and fit for plant quarantine purposes. Many detection methods occur for different seed-borne pathogens, but, few of the minimum requirements for adequate seed tests were satisfied.

3252,Water Stress Enhances the Progression of Branch Dieback and Almond Decline under Field Conditions,"Branch dieback and tree decline have been described as a common complex disease worldwide in woody crops, with Botryosphaeriaceae and Diaporthaceae being considered the most frequent fungi associated with the disease symptoms. Their behaviour is still uncertain, since they are considered endophytes becoming pathogenic in weakened hosts when stress conditions, such as water deficiency occur. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to determine if water stress enhances general decline on weakened almond trees subjected to different irrigation treatments under natural field conditions. In parallel, the occurrence of fungal species associated with almond decline was also determined in relation to disease progression by fungal isolation, and morphological and molecular based-methods. The symptoms of branch dieback and general decline were observed over time, mainly in the experimental plots subjected to high water deficiency.

Azúcar in Colombia,"The role of some Colletotrichum species is uncertain in crops of economic importance for Colombia such as mango (Mangifera indica L.) cv. Az & uacute;car. Eight Colletotrichum isolates from asymptomatic plant tissues were characterized by their pathogenicity on fruits and identified by phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of the ITS, GADPH, Tub2, CHs-1 and Act genomic regions. Colletotrichum asianum, C. gloeosporioides and C. tropicale of the C. gloeosporioides species complex and C. karstii of the C. boninense species complex were identified. The highest virulence was observed for isolates of C. asianum, that was the most prevalent species, and for C. tropicale, that showed high and intermediate virulence levels, indicating diversity in pathogenicity within the same species. The isolate of C. karstii, which displayed intermediate virulence, is the first report on mango in Colombia. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides presented intermediate virulence and was isolated at a low frequency in the present research. The mycelial growth rate did not show differences between species and ranged between 6.1 and 8.3 mm per day. Colletotrichum asianum recorded higher values of conidia germination and appressoria formation than other species, at 77% and 79%, respectively (p < 0.001). The shape and size of conidia did not vary between species. Appressoria exhibited different shapes between isolates and the largest average diameter was for C. karstii with 7.6 <mu>m (p < 0.001).

19601,Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Stemphylium Leaf Blight and Potential Inoculum Sources in New York Onion Fields.,"Stemphylium leaf blight (SLB) caused by Stemphylium vesicarium is the dominant foliar disease affecting large-scale onion production in New York. The disease is managed by fungicides, but control failures are prevalent and are attributed to fungicide resistance. Little is known of the relative role of inoculum sources in initiation and spread of SLB epidemics. Plate testing of 28 commercially available organic onion seedlots from 2016 and 2017 did not detect S. vesicarium. This finding suggests that although S. vesicarium has been reported as seed-transmitted, this is unlikely to be a significant inoculum source in commercially available organic seed lots and even less so in fungicide-treated seed used to establish conventional fields. The spatial and spatiotemporal dynamics of SLB epidemics in six onion fields were evaluated along linear transects in 2017 and 2018. Average SLB incidence increased from 0 to 100% throughout the cropping seasons with an average final lesion length of 28.3 cm. Disease progress was typical of a polycyclic epidemic and the logistic model provided the best fit to 83.3% of the datasets. Spatial patterns were better described by the beta-binomial than binomial distribution in half of the datasets (50%) and random patterns were more frequently observed by the index of dispersion (59%). Geostatistical analyses also found a low frequency of datasets with aggregation (60%). Spatiotemporal analysis of epidemics detected that the aggregation was influenced by disease incidence. However, diseased units were not frequently associated with the previous time period according to the spatiotemporal association function of spatial analyses by distance indices. Variable spatial patterns suggested mixed inoculum sources dependent upon location, and likely an external inoculum source at the sampling scale used in this study. A small-plot replicated trial was also conducted in each of 2 years to quantify the effect of S. vesicarium-infested onion residue on SLB epidemics in a field isolated from other onion fields. SLB incidence was significantly reduced in plots without residue compared with those in which residue remained on the soil surface. Burial of infested residue also significantly reduced epidemic progress in 1 year. The effect of infested onion residue on SLB epidemics in the subsequent onion crop suggests rotation or residue management may have a substantial effect on epidemics. However, the presence of an inoculum source external to fields in onion production regions, as indicated by a lack of spatial aggregation, may reduce the efficacy of in-field management techniques.",Hay F; Heck DW; Klein A; Sharma S; Hoepting C; Pethybridge SJ,Plant disease,2022,10.1094/PDIS-07-21-1587-RE,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,0.874570097224614,TRUE,1,5,Low,low frequency,isolated; observed; evaluated,were more frequently observed by the index of dispersion (59%).

11447,Diversity of microfungi associated with phyllosphere of endemic Serbian plant Nepeta rtanjensis Diklic & Milojevic,"Nepeta rtanjensis (Lamiaceae) is an endemic and critically endangered plant species that grows only on Rtanj Mountain in the southeastern Serbia. Due to its endemic character and distribution separated from the other Nepeta species in Mediterranean Basin, N. rtanjensis has been considered as a relict. It has been noticed that number of individual plants in natural habitat rapidly decreases. Hence, the project of reintroduction of this plant was successfully conducted. However, many aspects of its biology still remain unknown and necessary to investigate. In that sense, epiphytic and endophytic Nepeta rtanjensis phyllosphere fungi were studied at three sites in Serbia: Javor-Locus classicus, with autochthonous population and with reintroduced plants, and Belgrade with micro-propagated specimens in experimental field. The sites in Javor are located in the area of the Mountain Rtanj. From both, the surface and the interior of leaves, a total of 49 taxa of microfungi were identified, belonging to 35 genera. Alternaria spp. was reported on all studied sites with the highest isolation frequency (>75 %). Similarity between epiphytic and endophytic fungal assemblage was moderate. The highest fungal diversity was detected on site with the autochthonous Nepeta rtanjensis population.

1003,Isolation and analysis of endophytic microorganisms in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) leaves,"The present investigation was undertaken in order to select the surface-sterilization technique most efficient for eliminating epiphytes, to document the spectrum of endophytes of healthy leaves from three wheat cultivars in Buenos Aires Province (Argentina) and to determine their infection frequencies at three growth stages. Surface-sterilization with undiluted commercial solution of sodium hypochlorite was reaffirmed as adequate for removing epiphytes on wheat leaves. From the 450 wheat leaf segments incubated, three bacterial isolates and 130 fungal isolates were obtained. From all the isolates, 19 fungal species were identified. Bacterial isolates were characterized as Bacillus sp. There were significant differences between microorganisms, stages of growth, and stages x microorganisms interaction. Differences between cultivars, stages x cultivars, microorganisms x cultivars and for the triple interaction were not significant. Frequency of microorganisms isolated increased with crop age, but it was statistically similar for the three wheat cultivars tested (Klein Centauro, Klein Dragon and Buck Ombu).

10381,Minor species of foliar fungal endophyte communities: do they matter?,"Studies on the diversity and technological potential of leaf fungal endophytes invariably focus on the dominant fungal species among them. There is hardly any information on the diversity and role of endophytic fungi present in low frequencies (minor species) inside leaves. Hence, we studied the diversity of the minor species of leaf endophytes and speculate on the possible roles such fungi could play in the ecosystem. Mature leaves of twenty-five woody tree species from tropical dry thorn (DT), dry deciduous (DD), and montane evergreen (ME) forests of the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, southern India, were screened for the presence of minor species of fungal endophytes (colonization frequency of < 5%). We recorded 47, 35, and 51 minor species in DT, DD, and ME forests, respectively. Species of Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Corynespora, Drechslera, Eurotium, Gliocladium, Lasiodiplodia, Nigrospora, Nodulisporium, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, and Phoma were present in the leaves of trees growing in all the forests studied. Lasiodiplodia spp. were most common among the minor endophytes and could be isolated from 32 tree species from the 3 different forest types. Isolates of Lasiodiplodia spp. produced enzymes including beta-glucosidase, cellulase, laccase, pectinase, pectate transeliminase, and protease as well as antifungal metabolites.

4869,"Ecology of Hericium cirrhatum, H. coralloides and H. erinaceus in the UK","Hericium cirrhatum, Hericium coralloides and Hericium erinaceus are rarely recorded in Europe, and H. coralloides and H. erinaceus are Red Listed in several European countries. By contrast, H. erinaceus is common in nature in Japan and North America and easily cultivated for edible mushroom production. The three species are saprotrophs that grow on wood of broadleaved trees, particularly beech (Fagus sylvatica) in Britain. How they establish in the standing tree is uncertain, but they have been detected as latently present in functional sapwood. They frequently fruit in axenic culture, perhaps indicating that lack of fruit bodies in the field truly indicates lack of mycelial individuals, although it may be that natural fruiting is impeded by encapsulation within central woody tissues. Despite prolific sporulation in wild fruit bodies, basidiospore germination on agar is poor and large progeny sets of homokaryons were relatively difficult to obtain. The duration of the homokaryotic phase is unknown but may be prolonged due to low frequency of contact between mating compatible partners in natural substrata. Homokaryotic mycelia grow at least as rapidly as heterokaryons. Both homokaryons and heterokaryons are average to good combatants, the former slightly better than the latter. Poor growth and combative ability are unlikely to be the causes of apparent rarity in Europe, but poor germination and infrequent establishment may be.

11734,The Botanophila-Epichloe association in cultivated Festuca in Oregon:: evidence of simple fungivory,"We investigated the Botanophila (Diptera: Anthomyiidae)-Epichloe (Ascomycetes: Clavicipitaceae) interaction in cultivated Festuca spp. (fine fescue) in Oregon in western USA. Epichloe spp. are endophytic fungi of grasses in the subfamily Pooideae. They develop a felt-like stroma on the surface of grass culms and a dense mycelium within the culms that typically prevents seed head emergence. As a result, seed yields are suppressed, and hence the disease is known as choke. Studies of Epichloe spp. on wild grasses indicate that the fly-fungus interaction is an obligatory mutualism. During oviposition, Botanophila transfers Epichloe spermatia between stromata of opposite mating types, and the perithecia that develop after fungal fertilization serve as food for Botanophila larvae. In the current study, we surveyed 19 cultivated fields of Festuca spp. in Oregon, and observed choke caused by Epichloe festucae Leuchtmann, Schardl and Siegl in 10 of these. However, perithecia were observed in only four fields, and on only 1.0-2.6% of stromata. Perithecial development was also low, and rarely covered 50% of the stroma surface. Despite the absence or low frequency of fertilized stromata, Botanophila lobata Collin larvae were present in all choke-infested fields. Infestation levels ranged from 2.5 to 70.7%, based on an examination of 175-200 stromata from each field. Only eight (= 2%) of the 450 stromata with B. lobata had perithecia, and the greater majority of B. lobata larvae completed development and exited from unfertilized stromata. This is the first report of the B. lobata-E. festucae association in the USA, and of B. lobata larvae developing successfully on unfertilized Epichloe stromata. The average pupal weight (0.0032 g) did not differ significantly from pupae (0.0030 g) originating from larvae that had developed on fertilized stromata of E. typhina on Dactylis glomerata in a neighboring field. This result indicates that in cultivated fine fescue fields in Oregon, B. lobata forages on E. festucae, but fly development is not dependent on the fertilized stromata of Epichloe.","Rao, S; Alderman, SC; Takeyasu, J; Matson, B",ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA,2005,10.1111/j.1570-7458.2005.00309.x,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.858702383570778,TRUE,1,4,Low,low frequency,observed; investigated; surveyed,"was also low, and rarely covered 50% of the stroma surface.

13923,"THE SUBEPIDERMAL FUNGI OF CEREAL GRAINS II. THE NATURE, IDENTITY AND ORIGIN OF THE MYCELIUM IN WHEAT","An internal fungal mycelium between the epidermis and cross‐layer cells in normal wheat grains is shown to consist of extracellular septate hyphae forming a network on the inner surface of the epidermis, whose cells are occasionally penetrated. The mycelium, which is first observed at a comparatively late stage of maturation of the grain, usually remains as a loose network, although sclerotia and plate‐like structures suggestive of drought forms are occasionally present. These appearances support the view, derived from comparison of the drying rates of grain under various climatic conditions, that the spread of the subepidermal mycelium is finally restricted by desiccation beneath the epidermis during the drying out of the ripening grain. Cultures from surface‐sterilized grains of Bersée wheat have shown that the most common subepidermal fungus is Alternaria tenuis (in 64.4% of the grains). Bacteria (28.8%), Mycogone sp. (?) (7.7%), Cladosporium herbarum (5.8%), Pullularia pullulans (4.8%), Fusarium sp. (1.9%), Botrytis cinerea (1.9%) and Stemphylium botryosum (0.9%) were also isolated. The subepidermal mycelium apparently arises either from systemic infection of the wheat plant or from fungal spores and hyphae present on the outside of the developing grains and among the dead floral parts.

A total of 145 fungal taxa were identified based on molecular techniques, of these 125 taxa (86.2 %) belonging to Ascomycota, 14 (9.7 %) to Basidiomycota, 5 (3.4 %) to Zygomycota, and 1 (0.7 %) to undefined fungi. The species richness and diversity of endophytic fungi were significantly affected by tissue, and were 1.2-2.5-fold higher in the branches and barks when compared to the leaves. The locality affected the species richness per tree and the shannon diversity index per tree by longitude. The endophyte assemblages were strongly shaped by locality and tissue according to partial least squares discriminant analysis. In addition, the distributions of dominant fungi at orders and genera levels differed as a function of locality and tissue.

972,Red list plants: colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophytes,"Since information concerning the mycorrhization of endangered plants is of major importance for their potential re-establishment, we determined the mycorrhizal status of Serratula tinctoria (Asteraceae), Betonica officinalis (Lamiaceae), Drosera intermedia (Droseraceae) and Lycopodiella inundata (Lycopodiaceae), occurring at one of two wetland sites (fen meadow and peat bog), which differed in soil pH and available P levels. Root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) was quantified. Colonization by AMF appeared to be more frequent in the fen meadow than in the peat bog, and depended on the host plant. Roots of S. tinctoria and B. officinalis were well colonized by AMF in the fen meadow (35-55% root length) and both arbuscules and vesicles were observed to occur in spring as well as in autumn. In the peat bog, L. inundata showed a low level of root colonization in spring, when vesicles were found frequently but no arbuscules. In roots of D. intermedia from the peat bog, arbuscules and vesicles were observed, but AMF colonization was lower than in L. inundata. In contrast, the amount of AMF spores extracted from soil at the peat bog site was higher than from the fen meadow soil. Spore numbers did not differ between spring and autumn in the fen meadow, but they were higher in spring than in autumn in the peat bog. Acaulospora laevis or A. colossica and Glomus etunicatum were identified amongst the AMF spores extracted from soil at the two sites.
