7356,"Brachiaria is a pan-tropical genus of grasses with about 100 species. The fungus Acremonium implicatum can develop an endophytic association that is mutually beneficial with Brachiaria species. We developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method by first amplifying DNA from A. implicatum isolates using the Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique with arbitrary 10-mer primers. A 500-bp PCR product, amplified with primer OPAK-10 and common to A. implicatum isolates, was selected for further evaluation. The fragment was digoxygenin-labelled and used to probe a dot blot containing genomic DNA from isolates of A. implicatum and non-endophytic fungi, and from Brachiaria species free of endophytes. Strong signals were obtained only for DNA from A. implicatum isolates. This fragment was cloned and subsequently sequenced. Based on the sequence data, two primers were selected and synthesized: P1 (5'-TTCGAATGATAAGGCAGATC-3') and P4 (5'-ACGCATCCACTGTATGCTAC-3'). The primer pair amplified a single fragment of about 500 bp from DNA of A. implicatum isolates, whether from pure culture or in association with Brachiaria plants.

17979,"The bacterial leaf nodule symbiosis is an interaction where bacteria are housed in specialised structures in the leaves of their plant host. In the Rubiaceae plant family, host plants interact with Burkholderia bacteria. This interaction might play a role in the host plant defence system. It is unique due to its high specificity; the vertical transmission of the endophyte to the next generation of the host plant; and its supposedly obligatory character. Although previous attempts have been made to investigate this obligatory character by developing Burkholderia-free plants, none have succeeded and nodulating plants were still produced. In order to investigate the obligatory character of this endosymbiosis, our aims were to develop Burkholderia-free Psychotria umbellata plants and to investigate the effect of the absence of the endophytes on the host in a controlled environment. The Burkholderia-free plants were obtained via embryo culture, a plant cultivation technique. In order to analyse the endophyte-free status, we screened the plants morphologically, microscopically and molecularly over a period of three years. To characterise the phenotype and growth of the in vitro aposymbiotic plants, we compared the growth of the Burkholderia-free plants to the nodulating plants under the same in vitro conditions. All the developed plants were Burkholderia-free and survived in a sterile in vitro environment. The growth analysis showed that plants without endophytes had a slower development. Embryo culture is a cultivation technique with a high success rate for the development of Burkholderia-free plants of P. umbellata.

Deterrence is apparently due to several alkaloids the fungus produces. We asked if the fungus also affects the third trophic level. Specifically, we tested if several different isolates of the fungus altered the growth and survival of the parasitoid, Microctonus hyperodae. Adult weevils were collected from paddocks near Lincoln, New Zealand and maintained in an environmental chamber. Weevils were assorted into treatment groups and fed perennial ryegrass (cv.

All endophyte strains differed from one another with respect to the profile of alkaloids they produce. Following two weeks of acclimation, weevils were placed with M. hyperodae to allow for parasitization. Weevils were then placed into Petri dishes (10 per dish) and fed grass clippings from the appropriate treatment group. We collected weevils as they died and dissected them to assess the development of parasitoids. Emergence of prepupae from hosts and survival to adulthood were also recorded. Fungal isolates did not differ in their influence on weevil feeding or survival. In contrast, the effect of the endophyte on the parasitoid varied among isolates of the fungus. Isolates ARW and AR6 reduced parasitoid adult emergence relative to nit endophyte. In contrast, AR37 had no negative effect on survival of the parasitoid. Furthermore, an index of developmental rate showed that parasitoids developed more slowly when reared from hosts fed grass containing any of the strains of N. lolii, except AR37, compared to endophyte-free grass.

958,"Aploneura lentisci Pass. is endemic to the Mediterranean region where it is holocyclic, forming galls on its primary host, Pistacia lentiscus and alternating over a 2-year period between Pistacia and secondary hosts, principally species of Gramineae. This aphid is widely distributed in Australia and New Zealand on the roots of the common forage grasses, ryegrass (Lolium spp.) and tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix) where it exists as permanent, anholocyclic, parthenogenetic populations. Previous studies have indicated that infestations of A. lentisci significantly reduce plant growth and may account for differences in field performance of Lolium perenne infected with different strains of the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae var. lolii. These obligate biotrophs protect their host grasses from herbivory via the production of alkaloids. To confirm the hypothesis that growth of L. perenhe is associated with the effect of different endophyte strains on aphid populations, herbage and root growth were measured over time in two pot trials that compared three fungal endophyte strains with an endophyte-free control. In both pot trials, aphid numbers were lowest on plants infected with endophyte strain AR37 at all sampling times. In plants infected with a common toxic strain naturalized in New Zealand, aphid numbers overall were lower than on uninfected plants or those infected with strain AR1, but numbers did not always differ significantly from these treatments. Populations on AR1-infected plants were occasionally significantly higher than those on endophyte-free. Cumulative foliar growth was reduced in AR1 and Nil treatments relative to AR37 in association with population differences of A. lentisci in both trials and root dry weight was reduced in one trial. In four Petri dish experiments survival of A. lentisci on plants infected with AR37 declined to low levels after an initial phase of up to 19 days during which time aphids fed and populations were similar to those on plants without endophyte. Aphids on AR37-infected plants became uncoordinated in their movement and developed tremors before dying suggesting a neurotoxin was responsible for their mortality.

2085,"Mutualisms between fungal endophytes and forage grasses can exert broad-reaching effects on grassland communities and ecosystem processes. We hypothesised that endophytes of grasses would retard the process of faecal degradation since grazing animals consume primarily live plant material and excrete a large portion of the herbage they consume as faeces. We examined the degradation rates of faeces from sheep that had consumed pure swards of perennial ryegrass containing a range of unique strains (AR1, AR37, or Wild type) of the fungal endophyte, Neotyphodium lolii, or no endophyte. Ultimately, the presence of endophytes in perennial ryegrass resulted in slower faecal decay rates compared to the nil endophyte treatment, although only consistently for the C concentration decay rates that were approximately 2x to 4x slower in the endophyte-derived faecal matter. The decay rate of dry matter content was significantly slower (ca. 1.5x) in the novel endophyte-derived faeces (AR1 and AR37) compared to the nil endophyte-derived faeces. The N decay rates differed significantly only in the AR1 treatment that was approximately 4x slower than the nil endophyte group. The reduced decay rates are attributed to the presence of endophyte-derived alkaloids in the faeces, and a greater proportion of more easily degraded hemicellulose in faeces from sheep that consumed the endophyte-free grass. There were no significant differences in the faecal carbon and nitrogen decay rates among the three endophyte strain treatments. This suggests that all the strain-specific alkaloids might have similar effects, or that N. lolii has a general effect that is not strain-specific, such as altered fibre composition, as reported here. This is the first report of a fungal endophyte affecting the rate of faecal degradation, and the first report of the alkaloids peramine, lolitrem B and epoxy-janthitrems in faecal matter.

8970,"It is increasingly recognized that macro-organisms (corals, insects, plants, vertebrates) consist of both host tissues and multiple microbial symbionts that play essential roles in their host's ecological and evolutionary success. Consequently, identifying benefits and costs of symbioses, as well as mechanisms underlying them are research priorities. All plants surveyed under natural conditions harbor foliar endophytic fungi (FEE) in their leaf tissues, often at high densities. Despite producing no visible effects on their hosts, experiments have nonetheless shown that FEE reduce pathogen and herbivore damage. Here, combining results from three genomic, and two physiological experiments, we demonstrate pervasive genetic and phenotypic effects of the apparently asymptomatic endophytes on their hosts. Specifically, inoculation of endophyte-free (E) Theobroma cacao leaves with Colletotrichum tropicale (E+), the dominant FEE species in healthy T cacao, induces consistent changes in the expression of hundreds of host genes, including many with known defensive functions. Further, E+ plants exhibited increased lignin and cellulose content, reduced maximum rates of photosynthesis (A(max)), and enrichment of nitrogen-15 and carbon-13 isotopes. These phenotypic changes observed in E+ plants correspond to changes in expression of specific functional genes in related pathways. Moreover, a cacao gene (Tc00g04254) highly up-regulated by C. tropicale also confers resistance to pathogen damage in the absence of endophytes or their products in host tissues. Thus, the benefits of increased pathogen resistance in E+ plants are derived in part from up-regulation of intrinsic host defense responses, and appear to be offset by potential costs including reduced photosynthesis, altered host nitrogen metabolism, and endophyte heterotrophy of host tissues. Similar effects are likely in most plant-endophyte interactions, and should be recognized in the design and interpretation of genetic and phenotypic studies of plants.",2014,Presence,Presence,6,3,High,endophyte-free; absence of endophytes,observed; surveyed,"genetic and phenotypic effects of the apparently asymptomatic endophytes on their hosts.

No significant phenotypic variance for forage production was detected among EI families during the study.

Significant phenotypic variances were observed for all seed production traits in both EI and EF. Phenotypic variances for total seed weight and seed numbers in 1990 were greater for EI than for EF. Estimates of genetic variance for these traits were not greater than twice the standard error in the EF state but were greater than twice the standard error in the EI state.

1220,"Both endophytic and mycorrhizal fungi interact with plants to form symbiosis in which the fungal partners rely on, and sometimes compete for, carbon (C) sources from their hosts. Changes in photosynthesis in host plants caused by atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment may, therefore, influence those mutualistic interactions, potentially modifying plant nutrient acquisition and interactions with other coexisting plant species. However, few studies have so far examined the interactive controls of endophytes and mycorrhizae over plant responses to atmospheric CO2 enrichment. Using Festuca arundinacea Schreb and Plantago lanceolata L. as model plants, we examined the effects of elevated CO2 on mycorrhizae and endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum) and plant nitrogen (N) acquisition in two microcosm experiments, and determined whether and how mycorrhizae and endophytes mediate interactions between their host plant species. Endophyte-free and endophyte-infected F. arundinacea varieties, P. lanceolata L., and their combination with or without mycorrhizal inocula were grown under ambient (400 mu mol mol(-1)) and elevated CO2 (ambient + 330 mu mol mol(-1)). A N-15 isotope tracer was used to quantify the mycorrhiza-mediated plant acquisition of N from soil. Elevated CO2 stimulated the growth of P. lanceolata greater than F. arundinacea, increasing the shoot biomass ratio of P. lanceolata to F. arundinacea in all the mixtures. Elevated CO2 also increased mycorrhizal root colonization of P. lanceolata, but had no impact on that of F. arundinacea. Mycorrhizae increased the shoot biomass ratio of P. lanceolata to F. arundinacea under elevated CO2. In the absence of endophytes, both elevated CO2 and mycorrhizae enhanced N-15 and total N uptake of P. lanceolata but had either no or even negative effects on N acquisition of F. arundinacea, altering N distribution between these two species in the mixture. The presence of endophytes in F. arundinacea, however, reduced the CO2 effect on N acquisition in P. lanceolata, although it did not affect growth responses of their host plants to elevated CO2.

In Trial A, pasture mealybug were sampled in plots of the perennial ryegrass cultivar 'Grasslands Nui', without endophyte (nil), or infected with the wild-type endophyte, or the selected strains, AR1 and AR37. In Trial B, mealybug numbers on six ryegrass cultivars infected with AR1 or wild-type were compared with those on the same cultivars without endophyte.

19947,"Growth, developmental rate, and survival of black cutworms, Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel), were compared on cool-season turfgrasses used commonly on golf courses, including cultivars with or without Neotyphodium spp. (=Acremonium spp.) endophytes. We also studied feeding preferences of neonates and 5th instars, including possible effects of induction of preference, to clarify patterns of movement of larvae between creeping bentgrass, Agrostis palustris Hudson, putting greens and peripheral areas. Development of black cutworms on 3 diverse cultivars of Kentucky bluegrass, Poa pratensis L., was much poorer than on all other turfgrasses tested. Most larvae that fed on Kentucky bluegrass did not survive to pupation. In contrast, endophyte-free 'Assure' perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne L., and 'SR8300' tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea Schreber, were generally as suitable for cutworms as creeping bentgrass, the standard grass used on putting greens. Larvae reared on endophyte-infected SR8300 tall fescue showed no adverse effects; those fed endophyte-infected Assure perennial ryegrass showed only small reductions in growth rate compared with larvae reared on the same cultivar without endophyte. In laboratory choice tests, 1-d-old larvae consistently preferred creeping bentgrass over Kentucky bluegrass or tall fescue, regardless of which grass they had fed upon during the preceding 24 h. There was evidence for induction of preference for perennial ryegrass over creeping bentgrass in 1 of 2 trials. Preferences of 5th instars were more variable, but creeping bentgrass was preferred consistently over Kentucky bluegrass. In paired field plots, 5th instars did not discriminate between creeping bentgrass and perennial ryegrass, but preferred both of those species over Kentucky bluegrass. These results indicate that black cutworm densities could build up in areas of tall fescue or perennial ryegrass surrounding golf course putting greens and tees, and that endophyte infection of those grasses will not necessarily provide resistance.

Phenolic compounds are efficient chelators of aluminum (Al) and may influence Al tolerance in many plant species. The objective of our study was to determine if enhanced release of phenolic compounds by roots of E+ plants contributes to Al tolerance in tall fescue. Two cloned genotypes (DN2 and DN11) of tall fescue infected with their naturally occurring fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum (Morgan-Jones and Gams) Glenn, Bacon and Hanlin and their noninfected isolines were grown in nutrient solutions at 0 mu M Al(Al-) and at 640 mu M Al (Al+) under controlled environment conditions. Root and shoot dry matter (DM) of endophyte-infected tall fescue was greater in E+ than E- plants by 57% and 40%, respectively, when plants were grown without Al. Endophyte infection did not affect root and shoot DM of tall fescue grown with Al but relative (to Al-treatment) reduction in root and shoot DM was greater in E+ than E- plants. In response to Al stress, more Al (47%) and P (49%) could be desorbed from root surfaces of E+ than E- plants. Aluminum concentrations in roots of E+ plants were 35% greater and P concentrations were 10% less than those determined in roots of E- plants. No differences in mineral concentrations were observed in shoots, regardless of endophyte status, or Al level in nutrient solution. Roots of E+ plants increased pH of both Al- and Al+ nutrient solutions to a greater extent than roots of E- plants in a 48 h interval. Our results show that more Al can be sequestered on root surfaces and in root tissues of endophyte-infected tall fescue than in plants devoid of endophyte. Aluminum sequestration was greater on root surfaces and in root tissues of E+ than E- plants of a given tall fescue genotype.

3779,"The effect of fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium lolii) infection on the performance of perennial ryegrass ( Lolium perenne) growing under irrigation in a subtropical environment was investigated. Seed of 4 cultivars, infected with standard ( common toxic or wild-type) endophyte or the novel endophyte AR1, or free of endophyte ( Nil), was sown in pure swards, which were fertilised with 50 kg N/ha. month. Seasonal and total yield, persistence, and rust susceptibility were assessed over 3 years, along with details of the presence of endophyte and alkaloids in plant shoots. Endophyte occurrence in tillers in both the standard and AR1 treatments was above 95% for Bronsyn and Impact throughout and rose to that level in Samson by the end of the second year. Meridian AR1 only reached 93% while, in the standard treatment, the endophyte had mostly died before sowing. Nil endophyte treatments carried an average of similar to 0.6% infection throughout. Infection of the standard endophyte was associated with increased dry matter (DM) yields in all 3 years compared with no endophyte. AR1 also significantly increased yields in the second and third years. Over the full 3 years, standard and AR1 increased yields by 18% and 11%, respectively. Infection with both endophytes was associated with increased yields in all 4 seasons, the effects increasing in intensity over time. There was 27% better persistence in standard infected plants compared with Nil at the end of the first year, increasing to 198% by the end of the experiment, while for AR1 the improvements were 20 and 134%, respectively. The effect of endophyte on crown rust (Puccinia coronata) infection was inconsistent, with endophyte increasing rust damage on one occasion and reducing it on another. Cultivar differences in rust infection were greater than endophyte effects. Plants infected with the AR1 endophyte had no detectable ergovaline or lolitrem B in leaf, pseudostem, or dead tissue. In standard infected plants, ergovaline and lolitrem B were highest in pseudostem and considerably lower in leaf. Dead tissue had very low or no detectable ergovaline but high lolitrem B concentrations. Peramine concentration was high and at similar levels in leaf and pseudostem, but not detectable in dead material. Concentration was similar in both AR1 and standard infected plants.

Stromata, characteristic of the genus, frequently occurred on the reproductive tillers of Poa secunda subsp. juncifolia, but neither perithecia nor mature asci were observed. Conidiogenous cells and conidial characteristics were in the range of Epichloe typhina. Regions of the genes encoding beta-tubulin (tub2) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) were amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences grouped the Poa secunda subsp. juncifolia endophyte into one group within a non-hybrid Epichlo (e) over bar species complex. On the basis of morphology, host range and evolutionary history we propose that this endophyte represents a new species of Epichloe. The name Epichloe poae is proposed for this endophyte. The infectivity of the conidia produced on plants was evaluated. In the first experiment, using conidia of Epichlo (e) over bar poae from leaves and endophyte-free seeds of Poa secunda subsp. juncifolia we show that when germinating seeds and developing seedlings of the plant were exposed to conidia, 28-57% of seedlings became infected by the endophyte.

Evidence indicates that microbial symbionts play important roles in plant response to environmental changes. However, their role in plant facing gaseous tropospheric pollutants such as the highly reactive and phytotoxic ozone, have been scarcely studied. Here, we experimentally tested the consequences of maternal plant exposure to ozone on the longevity of Lohum mutiflontm seeds mediated by a vertically-transmitted fungal endophyte (Epichloe occultans). Seeds were produced by mother plants exposed to contrasting levels of ozone (low and high concentrations) in two phases of the life cycle (vegetative and reproductive). We first characterized the consequences of plant exposure to ozone on the state of the antioxidant glutathione in the seeds. Then, we examined viability dynamics of the seeds through an accelerated ageing trial and followed the physiological variables seed water content (SWC) and electrical conductivity (EC). Irrespectively of maternal ozone, seeds produced by endophyte-symbiotic plants presented higher contents of the oxidised form of glutathione. In the same direction, the fungal endophyte presence was associated with a dramatic reduction in seed longevity. The SWC was higher in endophyte-symbiotic seeds that in endophyte-free seeds.

2592,"Neotyphodium endophytes often confer benefits to their host grasses and may enhance invasiveness of some grasses. The knowledge of infection frequencies of endophytes among invading weed populations is necessary to understand the relationships between endophyte infection and invasiveness. Here we present data on infection frequencies of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.), an important weed in some farmlands in Japan, persisting in contrasting farmlands: a terraced paddy field and a wheat-soybean double-cropped field in the western region of Shizuoka prefecture, Japan. The terraced paddy site is a mosaic of several landscape elements such as paddy fields, levees, fallow and abandoned fields, with a high percentage of non-crop area. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) has been cultivated for more than a decade with no application of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and fungicides. The wheat-soybean field is characterized by the aggregation of large-scaled fields that were originally reconstructed paddy fields, showing a low percentage of non-crop area. Wheat and soybean have been grown as winter and summer crops, respectively, using chemical fertilizers and herbicides. We examined the presence or absence of endophytes in a total of 1200 seeds sampled from the two Italian ryegrass populations. The terraced paddy population exhibited a markedly high infection frequency (91.0%), due possibly to selective feeding of non-infected seeds by insects. In contrast, the wheat-soybean farmland population showed almost no infection (1.1%), whereas the putative source of the invasion in the proximity exhibited a relatively high infection rate (64.4%). Such a micro-scale variation in infection frequencies may be attributable to a loss in endophyte viability within the wheat-soybean field.

17193,"Penicillium crustosum Thom (1930) causes blue mold on pome fruits and is also regularly found on cheese, nuts, and soil (1,3). The fungus produces a wide range of mycotoxins such as penitrem A, roquefortine C, terrestric acid, and cyclopenol, which impact human health (1). In January and February 2013, 20 decayed apples, 'Golden Delicious' and 'Jonagold' (Malus × domestica Borkh.) with blue mold symptoms were collected from cold storages in Svilajnac and Bela Crkva, Serbia. Decayed areas were light to medium brown with blue green sporulation on the surface of the lesion. Decayed tissue was soft and watery with a sharp margin between the diseased and healthy areas. One isolate from each cultivar was designated JP2 ('Golden Delicious') and JBC7 ('Jonagold') and further characterized. Conidiophores of both isolates were terverticillate, stipes were septate with rough walls, and phialides were ampulliform. Conidia were smooth, borne in columns, and were spherical to subglobose. Conidial dimensions for JP2 were 3.2 to 4.56 (3.73) × 2.64 to 4.3 (3.32) μm and for JBC7 were 3.1 to 4.46 (3.65) × 2.81 to 4.27 (3.31) μm (n = 50). The isolates were cultured on Czapek yeast autolysate agar (CYA), malt extract agar (MEA), and yeast extract sucrose agar (YES) media and incubated at 25°C for 7 days. Mycelia were white with heavy sporulation yielding grayish green colonies on all media. Colonies were radially sulcate and velutinous, with clear exudate, and produced a yellow to orange reverse on CYA and YES. On MEA, colonies were plane, low, and mycelia subsurface with conidia having a dry powdery appearance. Crusts of conidial masses formed after 10 or more days. No growth was observed on CYA when these isolates were incubated at 37°C. Both isolates were identified as P. crustosum Thom using morphological characters according to (2) and (1). Species level identification was confirmed by isolating genomic DNA followed by amplification of the β-tubulin locus using gene specific primers via conventional PCR (4). MegaBLAST analysis of the 2X consensus nucleotide sequences revealed that JP2 and JBC7 (GenBank KJ433984 and 85) were 99% identical to P. crustosum culture collection isolate IBT 21518 (JN112030.1). Koch's postulates were examined using two apple cvs. Idared and Kolacara. Ten fruit per cultivar per isolate were inoculated on two sides of each fruit; 20 fruit were used as water-only inoculated controls. Fruit were washed with soap and water, surface sanitized with 70% ethanol, and placed into polyethylene boxes. Using a finishing nail, 4-mm wounds were created and inoculated with 50 μl of a 3 × 105/ml conidial suspension or Tween-treated sterile distilled water. Boxes with inoculated and control fruit were stored at 25°C for 10 days. The inoculated fruit developed small, soft, watery lesions, which enlarged into decayed areas with defined edges and abundant sporulation on the surface. Symptoms were identical to the original ones, while the control fruit remained symptomless. The fungus was re-isolated from infected tissue and showed the same morphological characteristics as the original isolates, thus completing Koch's postulates. Blue mold occurs during long term storage of apples and is predominantly caused by P. expansum. This is the first report of P. crustosum causing postharvest blue mold decay on apple fruit obtained from storage in Serbia and indicates that P. crustosum is an emerging pathogen for the Serbian pome fruit growing and packing industry.

17194,"Penicillium polonicum K. Zaleski is an economically important airborne fungus with a broad host range including cereals, peanuts, onions, dried meats, citrus fruits, and yam tubers (2,4). Secondary metabolites produced by this species include harmful mycotoxins penicillic acid, verucosidin, and nephrotoxic glycopeptides, which may play a role in Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (2,5). In January 2013, decayed onion bulbs (Allium cepa L. cv. Meranto) with blue mold symptoms were found causing significant economic losses at a storage facility in Stara Pazova, Serbia, and were collected. The decayed area of the bulbs was pale yellow to light brown, and tissue was soft and watery. Bluish green sporulation was abundant on the surface and inside the bulb, between decayed scales. Two isolates (designated L1a and L4p) were obtained and further characterized using morphological and molecular methods. Colonies on potato dextrose agar (PDA), Czapek yeast autolysate agar (CYA), malt extract agar (MEA), and yeast extract sucrose agar (YES) media at 25°C after 7 days were blue green, velutinous, with clear exudate present on CYA. Colony reverse color on CYA and YES for both isolates were cream to yellow brown. The mean colony diameter on PDA for L1a was 29.89 ± 0.96 mm, and for L4p was 26 ± 0.37 mm; on CYA 32.56 ± 0.53 mm for L1a and 30.11 ± 2.42 mm for L4p; and on YES 33.86 ± 1.59 mm for L1a and 31.17 ± 1.83 mm for L4p. No growth was observed on CYA when isolates were incubated at 37°C. Conidiophores of both isolates were terverticillate, stipes were septate with smooth to finely roughened walls, and phialides were ampulliform. Conidia were globose to subglobose, smooth-walled, and borne in columns. Conidial dimensions for L4p were 2.72 to 3.82 (3.26) × 2.36 to 3.42 (2.95) μm, and for L1a were 2.87 to 4.39 (3.58) × 2.53 to 3.79 (3.16) μm (n = 50). Both isolates tested positive for the production of cyclopiazonic acid and other alkaloids, as indicated by a violet reaction for the Ehrlich test. Morphological characters of L1a and L4p were in accordance with those described for P. polonicum K. Zaleski (2). Genomic DNA was isolated using CTAB extraction method (1) and molecular identification was completed using gene specific primers for the β-tubulin locus (Bt-LEV-Up4/Bt-LEV-Lo1) via conventional PCR (3). The nucleotide sequences of amplified products (~800 bp) have been assigned to GenBank (KJ570971 and 72). MegaBLAST of obtained sequences showed a 99% similarity with several sequences of P. polonicum deposited in GenBank, which confirmed the morphological identification. Pathogenicity was tested by wound inoculation of 10 surface sanitized onion bulbs cv. Meranto with 50 μl of a 105/ml conidial suspension from isolates grown on PDA. Ten control onion bulbs were wound-inoculated with Tween-treated sterile distilled water. After 30 days incubation in plastic containers, under high humidity at 22°C, typical symptoms of blue mold developed on inoculated bulbs, while non-inoculated controls remained symptomless. Isolates recovered from inoculated bulbs showed the same morphological characteristics as the original isolates, thus completing Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. polonicum on stored onion in Serbia. Results from this study indicate that a holistic approach to control this fungus should be implemented that may include one or all of the following: increased sanitation methods to eliminate inoculum, breeding for resistant onion cultivars, and integration of additional control methods to maintain onion quality during storage.

17213,"The loquat (Eriobotrya japonica (Thunb.) Lindl.), an important perennial evergreen fruit crop that originated in China and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant, is well known all over the world for high nutritional, medicinal, economic, and ecological values (4). So far, it has been grown in more than 30 countries (1) and is becoming an important industry in China, Spain, Japan, India, Pakistan, and Turkey (2). During an investigation from May to August of 2013, severely withered loquat plants were observed in Kunming city of Yunnan Province (25°02' N; 102°42' E), Southwest China. Initial symptoms were brown lesions of leaves and canker on one to several branches, leaves of the whole tree turned wilted. Cross sections of diseased plants revealed irregularly shaped brown discoloration in the xylem of the trunk. A fungus was consistently isolated from the leaf when diseased leaves were incubated between two slices of fresh carrot root. Spore masses were picked from the apices of perithecia and transferred to malt extract agar medium (MEA) and incubated at 25°C. After perithecium formation, observed perithecia were black, globose (176.0 to 303.2 × 186.0 to 274.3 μm) and showed a long black neck (634.2 to 809.9 μm). Ascospore had the typical format of a ""hat"" with dimensions of 4.6 to 6.3 × 3.3 to 4.8 μm. Cylindrical endoconidia (7.1 to 36.1 × 2.9 to 6.0 μm) were found. Chlamydospores were ovoid or obpyriform and smooth (8.6 to 12.1 × 6.9 to 12.1 μm). PCR amplification was carried out for one isolate, YT2. The ITS region of rDNA was sequenced using the procedures of Thorpe et al (3). Analysis of ITS sequence data (GenBank Accession Nos. KF963101 and KF963102) showed that the isolates were 99% homologous to the isolate of Ceratocystis fimbriata from diseased Colocasia esculenta in Cuba, China, and Hawaii (AY526304 to 06) by BLAST analysis. Therefore, the fungus was identified as C. fimbriata based on morphological and molecular characteristics. Pathogenicity of the six isolates from this study was tested by inoculation of 1-year-old pot grown seedlings of loquat. The soil of six plants was inoculated by drenching with 40 ml spore suspension (106 spores/ml). Control plants were inoculated with 40 ml of sterile distilled water. The plants were maintained in a controlled greenhouse at 25°C and watered weekly. After inoculation for 1 week, all plants produced wilt symptoms; as the disease progressed, leaves withered and died after 3 weeks of inoculation while control plants remained symptomless. C. fimbriata was successfully re-isolated from the infected trees and no fungal growth was observed in the controls. The pathogenicity assay showed that C. fimbriata was pathogenic to loquat. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. fimbriata causing wilt of loquat in China. Since C. fimbriata is one of the most aggressive plant pathogens on a wide variety of perennial as well as agronomic crop plants worldwide, and the infection can pose a significant threat to the production of loquat, it is critical to deploy appropriate management strategies to limit the fungus spread.

16623,"Phlox paniculata L. (fall phlox) is a perennial garden species belonging to the Polemoniaceae family. During the spring of 2003 and 2004, leaf spot symptoms were observed on fall phlox plants in some private gardens in the Biella area (northern Italy). Lesions were first observed on leaves at the collar level and later on the entire plant. Lesions started as water-soaked areas, which in few days developed on the upper side of the leaves into irregular, shrunken, reddish brown spots from 1 to 2 mm in diameter. Lesions on the lower surface sometimes had a translucent halo. In many cases, the leaves were completely withered. Disease was particularly severe during the spring and fall and its incidence ranged from 10 to 25%. No fungal structures were observed within the lesions. Small fragments of tissue from affected leaves were macerated in nutrient yeast dextrose broth (NYDA), and dilutions of the resulting suspension were streaked onto NYDA and potato dextrose agar (PDA). Isolations were made from at least 25 leaves. Plates were maintained at 22 ± 1°C for 48 h. No fungi were isolated from the spots on NYDA or PDA. Colonies typical of Pseudomonas species were consistently isolated on NYDA. Isolates were negative for levan, potato soft-rot (pectolytic activity), and arginine dehydrolase while positive for oxidase and hypersensitivity on tobacco leaves. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of whole-cell protein analysis (1) indicated that the bacterium isolated was similar to Pseudomonas cichorii (Swingle) Stapp NCPPB 943 and 3283 strains. On King's medium B, (2) a typical fluorescent pigment was produced. The pathogen was identified as Pseudomonas cichoriii. Pathogenicity of 10 colonies was tested by growing inoculum in nutrient-broth shake cultures for 48 h, suspending bacterial cultures in water, diluting to 106 CFU/ml, and spraying 10 1-year-old healthy plants of P. paniculata. Ten control plants were sprayed with sterile nutrient broth. Inoculated and control plants were kept covered with plastic bags for 72 h. After 8 days in a growth chamber at 20 ± 1°C, leaf spots identical to those observed in the field developed on leaves of inoculated plants. Control plants remained symptomless. The pathogenicity test was repeated once. Bacteria were reisolated from the spots and identified as P. cichoriii. To our knowledge, this is the first record of bacterial leaf spot of Phlox paniculata in Italy as well as in the world. References: (1) D. H. Bergey et al.

16628,"During the spring of 2003, plants of Viburnum sargentii, a species mostly used in gardens as low-maintenance hedges, showing symptoms unlike those of known diseases were observed in some private gardens in the Biella area (northern Italy). Lesions on leaves were the only symptoms seen. Lesions started as water-soaked, circular areas that in 4 days developed into irregular, shrunken, brown spots from 2 to 4 mm in diameter. The core of older lesions appeared somewhat transparent. Leaves dried up completely 3 weeks after symptoms were first seen. No fungal structures were observed in lesions. Microscopic examination of affected leaf tissues revealed abundant bacterial ooze from the cut margin of lesions. Small fragments of tissue from affected leaves were macerated in nutrient yeast dextrose broth (NYDA) and dilutions of the resulting suspension were streaked onto NYDA and potato dextrose agar (PDA). Isolations were made from at least 25 leaves. Plates were maintained at 22 ± 1°C for 48 h. Slightly yellow colonies typical of Pseudomonas species were consistently isolated on NYDA. No fungi were isolated from the spots on NYDA or PDA. Levan production, oxidase production, pectinolytic activity, arginin dihydrase production, and tobacco hypersensitivity (LOPAT) were tested. Strains were positive for levan and negative for oxidase, arginine dihydrolase, and nitrate reductase. Strains did not rot potato slices but induced a hypersensitive reaction on tobacco leaves. Protein analysis (1) indicated that the bacterium isolated was similar to Pseudomonas syringae pv. viburnii NCPPB 1921. The pathogen was identified as Pseudomonas syringae pv. viburnii (2,3). Pathogenicity of 10 colonies was tested by growing inoculum in nutrient broth shake cultures for 48 h, suspending bacterial cultures in water, diluting to 106 CFU/ml, and spraying five 1-year-old healthy plants of Viburnum sargentii.

After 7 days in a growth chamber at 20 ± 1°C, leaf spots identical to those observed in the field developed on leaves of inoculated plants. Control plants remained symptomless. The pathogenicity test was repeated once. Strains were isolated from the spots and identified as P. syringae pv. viburnii. To our knowledge, this is the first record of bacterial leaf spot of Viburnum sargentii in Europe.

16711,"In 2000 and 2001, a new disease was observed on commercial spinach (Spinacia oleracea) in the Salinas Valley, Monterey County, CA. Initial symptoms were water-soaked, irregularly shaped leaf spots (2 to 3 mm diameter). As the disease developed, spots enlarged to as much as 1 to 2 cm, were vein-delimited, and turned dark brown. Faint chlorotic halos sometimes surrounded the spots. Death of large areas of the leaf occurred if spots coalesced. Spots were visible from the adaxial and abaxial sides of leaves, and no fungal structures were observed. The disease occurred on newly expanded and mature foliage. No fungi were isolated from the spots. However, cream-colored bacterial colonies were consistently isolated on sucrose peptone agar, and these strains were nonfluorescent on King's medium B. Strains were positive for levan and negative for oxidase, arginine dihydrolase, and nitrate reductase. Strains did not grow at 36°C, did not rot potato slices, but induced a hypersensitive reaction in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Turk). These results suggested the bacterium was similar to Pseudomonas syringae. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis (MIS-TSBA 4.10, MIDI Inc., Newark, DE) indicated the strains were highly similar (80.1 to 89.3%) to P. syringae pv. maculicola. However, in contrast to P. syringae pv. maculicola, the spinach strains did not utilize the carbon sources erythritol, L+tartrate, L lactate, and DL-homoserine. Pathogenicity of 10 strains was tested by growing inoculum in nutrient broth shake cultures for 48 h, diluting to 106 CFU/ml, and spraying 4-week-old plants of spinach cv. Bossanova. Control plants were sprayed with sterile nutrient broth. After 5 to 8 days in a greenhouse (24 to 26°C), leaf spots identical to those observed in the field developed on cotyledons and true leaves of inoculated plants. Strains were reisolated from the spots and identified as P. syringae. Control plants remained symptomless. The 10 strains were also inoculated on beet (Beta vulgaris), Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris subsp. cicla), cilantro (Coriandrum sativum), and spinach. Spinach showed leaf spots after 8 days; however, none of the other plants developed symptoms. Two strains were inoculated onto spinach cvs. Califlay, Lion, Nordic IV, Polka, Resistoflay, Rushmore, RZ 11, Spinnaker, Springfield, Viroflay, and Whitney. Leaf spot developed on all cultivars, and the pathogen was reisolated. Because the FAME data indicated a similarity between the spinach pathogen and P. syringae pv. maculicola, we inoculated sets of spinach cv. Bolero, cabbage (Brassica oleracea subsp. capitata cv. Grenedere), and cauliflower (Brassica oleracea subsp. botrytis cv. White Rock) with three P. syringae pv. maculicola and three spinach strains. Cabbage and cauliflower developed leaf spots only when inoculated with P. syringae pv. maculicola; spinach had leaf spots only when inoculated with the spinach strains. All inoculation experiments were done twice, and the results of the two tests were the same. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bacterial leaf spot of spinach in California caused by a nonfluorescent P. syringae, and the first record of this disease in the United States. Biochemical characteristics and limited host range of the pathogen indicate the California strains are likely the same as the P. syringae pv. spinaciae pathogen that was reported in Italy (1) and Japan (2).

17454,"Endophytic actinobacteria colonize internal tissues of their host plants and are considered as a rich and reliable source of diverse species and functional microorganisms. In this study, endophytic actinobacterial strain YIM 63111 was isolated from surface-sterilized tissue of the medicinal plant Artemisia annua. We identified strain YIM 63111 as a member of the genus Pseudonocardia. A. annua seedlings grown under both sterile and greenhouse conditions were inoculated with strain YIM 63111.

The aim of the present study was to assess fungal contamination in two WWTP operating in Lisbon. In addition, particulate matter (PM) contamination data was analyzed. To apply conventional methods, air samples from the two plants were collected through impaction using an air sampler with a velocity air rate of 140 L/min. Surfaces samples were collected by swabbing the surfaces of the same indoor sites. All collected samples were incubated at 27 degrees C for 5 to 7 d. After lab processing and incubation of collected samples, quantitative and qualitative results were obtained with identification of the isolated fungal species. For molecular methods, air samples of 250 L were also collected using the impinger method at 300 L/min airflow rate. Samples were collected into 10 ml sterile phosphate-buffered saline with 0.05% Triton X-100, and the collection liquid was subsequently used for DNA extraction. Molecular identification of Aspergillus fumigatus and Stachybotrys chartarum was achieved by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using the Rotor-Gene 6000 qPCR Detection System (Corbett). Assessment of PM was also conducted with portable direct-reading equipment (Lighthouse, model 3016 IAQ). Particles concentration measurement was performed at five different sizes: PM0.5, PM1, PM2.5, PM5, and PM10. Sixteen different fungal species were detected in indoor air in a total of 5400 isolates in both plants. Penicillium sp. was the most frequently isolated fungal genus (58.9%), followed by Aspergillus sp. (21.2%) and Acremonium sp. (8.2%), in the total underground area. In a partially underground plant, Penicillium sp. (39.5%) was also the most frequently isolated, also followed by Aspergillus sp. (38.7%) and Acremonium sp. (9.7%).

723,"Plant associations with soil microbiota can modulate tree seedling growth and survival via mutualistic or antagonistic interactions. It is uncertain, however, whether soil microbiota influence seedling growth of coastal trees when exposed to extreme flooding regimes. We evaluated the role of soil microbes in promoting baldcypress (Taxodium distichum) seedling performance under different inundation scenarios and determined the influence of flooding on the colonization ofin plantabeneficial microbes. Seedlings reared in sterile and non-sterile soil were exposed to three different flooding regimes historically experienced in Louisiana swamps. Seedling growth was assessed, and the colonization by beneficial symbionts such as arbuscular mycorrizhal fungi (AMF), and dark septate endophytes (DSE) was evaluated in harvested roots. Seedlings grown in sterile soil had six times higher growth than seedlings reared in non-sterile soil. As a result, we evaluated pathogen load in the roots by assessing oomycete colonization. Flooding influenced thein plantacolonization of DSE and oomycetes, but did not affect the colonization of mutualist AMF fungi. DSE and oomycetes were rarer in flooded conditions, while AMF remained abundant. Seedling biomass production was not correlated within plantafungal colonization or pathogen load. Soil microbiota can negatively influence baldcypress seedling growth, and no growth benefit was evidenced from the root colonization of mutualist fungi.

782,"Tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.)] is a cool-season perennial grass used in pastures throughout the Southeastern United States. The grass can harbor a shoot-specific fungal endophyte (Epichloe coenophiala) thought to provide the plant with enhanced resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Because alkaloids produced by the common variety of the endophyte cause severe animal health issues, focus has been on replacing the common-toxic strain with novel varieties that do not produce the mammal-toxic alkaloids but maintain abiotic and biotic stress tolerance benefits. Little attention has been given to the influence of the plant-fungal symbiosis on rhizosphere processes. Therefore, our objective was to study the influence of this relationship on plant biomass production and root exudate composition in tall fescue cultivars PDF and 97TF1, which were either not infected with the endophyte (E-), infected with the common toxic endophyte (CIE+) strain or with one of two novel endophytes (AR542E(+), AR584E(+)). Plants were grown sterile for 3 weeks after which plant biomass, total organic carbon, total phenolic content and detailed chemical composition of root exudates were determined. Plant biomass production and exudate phenolic and organic carbon content were influenced by endophyte status, tall fescue cultivar, and their interaction. GC-TOF MS identified 132 compounds, including lipids, carbohydrates and carboxylic acids. Cluster analysis showed that the interaction between endophyte and cultivar resulted in unique exudate profiles. This is the first detailed study to assess how endophyte infection, notably with novel endophytes, and tall fescue cultivar interact to influence root exudate composition.

Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR) and PCR amplification and sequencing were used to characterize the abundance and diversity of the AOB-amoA, nirK and nosZ genes in rhizosphere soils of endophyte-infected (E+) plants and endophyte-free (E-) plants. A significant enhancement of total Phosphorus (P), Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), Ammonium ion (NH4+) and Nitrate ion (NO3-) contents in the rhizosphere soil was recorded in endophyte-infected plants at different sampling times compared to endophyte-free plants (p <= 0.05). The absolute abundance of the AOB-amoA gene at T0 and T1 times was higher, as was the absolute abundance of the nosZ gene at T0, T1 and T3 times in the E+ plant rhizophere soils relative to E- plant rhizosphere soils. A significant change in relative abundance of the AOB-amoA and nosZ genes in the host rhizophere soils of endophyte-infected plants at T1 and T3 times was observed. The experiment failed to show any significant alteration in abundance and diversity of the nirK gene, and diversity of the AOB-amoA and nosZ genes.

From B. brizantha accession CIAT 6780, we isolated an endophytic fungus that may be economically significant. The fungus was identified as Acremonium implicatum (J. Gilman & E.V. Abott). 18S rDNA and ITS rDNA sequences were used to characterize isolates of the endophyte, and showed that they belonged to the Acremonium genus, being close to A. strictum and A. kiliense. Using the random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique, involving arbitrary primers of 10 bases, we showed that the isolates were highly similar to each other.

Methods We utilized Sanger and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) for taxonomic authentication of fifteen herbal supplements representing three different producers from five medicinal plants: Echinacea purpurea, Valeriana officinalis, Ginkgo biloba, Hypericum perforatum and Trigonella foenum-graecum. Experimental design included three modifications of DNA extraction, two lysate dilutions, Internal Amplification Control, and multiple negative controls to exclude background contamination. Ginkgo supplements were also analyzed using HPLC-MS for the presence of active medicinal components. Results All supplements yielded DNA from multiple species, rendering Sanger sequencing results for rbcL and ITS2 regions either uninterpretable or non-reproducible between the experimental replicates. Overall, DNA from the manufacturer-listed medicinal plants was successfully detected in seven out of eight dry herb form supplements; however, low or poor DNA recovery due to degradation was observed in most plant extracts (none detected by Sanger; three out of seven-by NGS). NGS also revealed a diverse community of fungi, known to be associated with live plant material and/or the fermentation process used in the production of plant extracts. HPLC-MS testing demonstrated that Ginkgo supplements with degraded DNA contained ten key medicinal components. Conclusion Quality control of herbal supplements should utilize a synergetic approach targeting both DNA and bioactive components, especially for standardized extracts with degraded DNA. The NGS workflow developed in this study enables reliable detection of plant and fungal DNA and can be utilized by manufacturers for quality assurance of raw plant materials, contamination control during the production process, and the final product.

To reduce the complexity of this system, we aimed to produce fungi-null wheat (Triticum aestivum) plants. To this end, we treated seeds with heat and fungicides and generated plants from rescued embryos and callus tissue. A culture-based approach and reverse transcription PCR analysis were negative, indicating that all treatments produced plants apparently free of fungi. However, the analysis of DNA using digital droplet PCR and next-generation sequencing revealed that tissues from all treatments retained low levels but diversity-rich FECs. While the FECs varied in composition across treatments and tissues, they all included core taxa of the mycobiome. The reduced fungal biomass, along with the changes in FEC composition, negatively affected plant development, supporting a FEC contribution to proper plant development and fitness. Our discovery that a large part of the FEC cannot be separated from plants and can be transmitted through seeds and tissue culture calls for reevaluation of particular microbiome paradigms, such as core taxa concepts, transmission modes, and functional species. IMPORTANCE The native microbiome in a given plant must be considered when evaluating the effect of a single taxon or synthetic community.

2024,"Litter decomposition plays a key role in nutrient cycling across ecosystems. The presence of Epichloe endophytes in grass plants affects litter decomposition. The overall effects of leaf litter containing Epichloe endophytes on the chemical and biological properties in non-rhizosphere soils have not previously been examined. The current study is aimed to understand the effect of direct incorporation of leaf litter from Epichloe endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) on soil chemical characteristics, and fungal and bacterial biodiversity. Firstly, fresh leaf litter of the endophyte Epichloe festucae var. lolii-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) L. perenne were incorporated into the soil, and then samples were collected from E+ and E- litter incorporated soil at T-0, T-1, T-2 and T-3 (0, 120, 240 and 360 days) for chemical and sequencing analyses. The Epichloe-containing leaf litter incorporation changed the soil microbial environment by enhancing the soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus, NH4+-N and NO3--N contents, and acidifying soil pH. The endophyte had stronger effects on soil bacteria than soil fungi when the litter was determined with and without the endophyte. Litter containing the Epichloe endophyte significantly increased the absolute abundance of the 16S rRNA gene and relative abundances of the Actinobacteria, Nitrospirae and Gemmatimonadetes, while significantly decreasing the relative abundances of the Planctomycetes and Rokubacteria and the diversity in soil bacteria community. There was no significant effect of endophyte-containing leaf litter incorporation on the absolute abundance and diversity of the soil fungal community except the increment in the relative abundance of Rozellomycota. Soil pH and the SOC-to-TN ratio (C:N) were the main factors influencing the soil bacterial community, and the presence of E. festucae var. lolii was directly and positively related to the soil bacterial diversity. The current study established that Epichloe endophyte-infection altered the abundance and diversity of the soil bacterial community by affecting leaf litter quality and increasing soil chemical properties after litter incorporation. Highlights Soil microbial habitat was changed by leaf litter with Epichloe endophyte incorporation. Litter containing endophytes increased the absolute abundance of the 16S rRNA gene.

2059,"Vertical transmission of symbiotic Epichloe endophytes from host grasses into progeny seed is the primary mechanism by which the next generation of plants is colonized. This process is often imperfect, resulting in endophyte-free seedlings which may have poor ecological fitness if the endophyte confers protective benefits to its host. In this study, we investigated the influence of host genetics and environment on the vertical transmission of Epichloe festucae var. bill strain AR37 in the temperate forage grass Lolium perenne. The efficiency of AR37 transmission into the seed of over 500 plant genotypes from five genetically diverse breeding populations was determined. In Populations I-III, which had undergone previous selection for high seed infection by AR37, mean transmission was 88, 93, and 92%, respectively. However, in Populations IV and V, which had not undergone previous selection, mean transmission was 69 and 70%, respectively. The transmission values, together with single-nucleotide polymorphism data obtained using genotyping-by-sequencing for each host, was used to develop a genomic prediction model for AR37 seed transmission. The predictive ability of the model was estimated at r = 0.54. While host genotype contributed greatly to differences in AR37 seed transmission, undefined environmental variables also contributed significantly to seed transmission across different years and geographic locations. There was evidence for a small host genotype-by-environment effect; however this was less pronounced than genotype or environment alone. Analysis of endophyte infection levels in parent plants within Populations I and IV revealed a loss of endophyte infection over time in Population IV only. This population also had lower average tiller infection frequencies than Population I, suggesting that AR37 failed to colonize all the daughter tillers and therefore seeds. However, we also observed that infection of seed by AR37 may fail during or after initiation of floral development from plants where all tillers remained endophyte-infected over time.

Recently, it has been shown that supplemental CP can improve performance in weaned steers postvaccination. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of supplemental CP on innate and adaptive immune responses in stocker steers chronically exposed to ergovaline. Angus steers (n = 12 pens; 3 steers/pen) were stratified by weight and assigned to a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement to examine crude protein levels of supplement (14% or 18%) and ergovaline exposure (0 or 185 μg ergovaline/kg BW/d via ground endophyte-free (EF) or endophyte-infected (EI) tall fescue seed, respectively) on immune response. Consumption of low to moderate concentration of ergovaline from EI tall fescue seed was sufficient to induce mild symptoms associated with fescue toxicosis. Blood samples were collected at day 0, 42, and 56 to evaluate infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) type 1b titers following vaccine challenge. Additionally, serum cytokine concentrations were evaluated using Quantibody Bovine Cytokine Arrays on day 0, 28, and 42. Data were analyzed using PROC MIXED of SAS with repeated measures. Regardless of treatment, no differences were observed in IBR and BVDV-1b seroconversion following vaccine challenge (P > 0.05).

1745,"Tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) S.J.

14460,"Endophytes are commonly defined as fungi that colonize internal tissues of plants for all or part of their life cycle. The largest plant family hosting endophytes is Poaceae. Enhanced competitive ability of endophyte-infected grasses has been well documented, including improved shoot and root growth, and greater resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the role of endophytes on the allelopathic effect of host grass is less studied. Achnatherum sibiricum is a perennial sparse bunchgrass, which always occurs as an accompanying species, and is typically highly infected by fungal endophytes. A. sibiricum can be infected by three endophytic fungi, Neotyphodium sibiricum (Ns), Neotyphodium gansuensis (Ng), and Epichloë gansuensis (Eg). Early studies of A. sibiricum-endophyte symbiota suggested that endophyte infection could improve the growth and stress tolerance of A. sibiricum, allowing the host grass to adapt to stressful or even extreme environmental conditions. However, few studies have examined effects of endophyte infection on allelopathic performance of A. sibiricum. In our study, we selected the natural grass Stipa grandis, a dominant species in a native community of A. sibiricum, as our research subject. The allelopathic effect of water aqueous extracts of A. sibiricum with different endophyte infection levels on seed germination and seedling growth of S. grandis was tested in petri dishes in the laboratory. GC-MS were used to identify chemical components of aqueous extracts of A. sibiricum. The results were as follows:(1) Uninfected A. sibiricum elicited the strongest inhibitory effect on the germination and seedling growth of S. grandis. Endophyte infection could alleviate allelopathic effect of A. sibiricum on the target species. (2) The allelopathic effect of A. sibiricum was related to the endophyte species. Compared with endophyte-free A. sibiricum, Eg infection significantly alleviated the allelopathic effect of A. sibiricum, whereas Ns and Ng infection tended to alleviate the allelopathic potential of the host grass, although the difference was not significant. (3) Four allelochemicals in water aqueous extracts of A. sibiricum were identified via GC-MS, including 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, phthalic acid, dibutyl phthalate, and methyl stearate. The relative difference in the amounts of these four allelochemicals may account for different allelopathic responses of A. sibiricum. (4) The allelopathic effect of the four potential allelochemicals was validated. The results showed that 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol had no significant effect on S. grandis at lower concentration, but was inhibitory at higher concentration, as compared to the control. Dibutyl phthalate showed a “low-promotion and high-inhibition effect”, whereas phthalic acid and methyl stearate showed a “dose effect” on S. grandis. Therefore, the four potential allelochemicals could inhibit seed germination and seedling growth of S. grandis at higher concentrations. © 2017, Ecological Society of China.

15015,The tillers of the Poaceous crop plant Hordeum bogdanii develop from non-elongating internodes at the base of the stem，form adventitious roots，and can survive independently of the main stem. The yield of H. bogdanii is mainly increased by tillering，which is regulated by both endophytic fungi and genes of the host. To explore the effect of endophytic fungi on the tiller-related gene TB1 in the host plant，the TB1 gene of H. bogdanii was cloned by RT-PCR，sequenced，and then analyzed using bioinformatic methods. The transcript levels of TB1 were determined by PCR using SYBR Green fluorescent dye. These PCR analyses were conducted for H. bogdanii with endophytic fungi（E+） and without endophyte fungi（E-） growing in Wensu County，Xinjiang and Tsaidam Basin，Qinghai. The full-length coding sequence of the TB1 gene cloned from H. bogdanii was 804 bp，encoding a polypeptide consisting of 267 amino acid residues. The TB1 gene had no promoter and did not encode a polyA tail. A subcellular localization analysis predicted that TB1 localizes in the vacuole. The TB1 protein，which belongs to the TCP family，has no transmembrane domains and no signal peptide，so it is not a transmembrane protein. It was predicted to be an unstable protein. The TB1 gene of H. bogdanii showed the highest homology（96. 72%）with TB1 of Hordeum vulgare subsp. ，and was located in the same branch as TB1 from H. vulgare subsp. in the phylogenetic tree. The transcript profiles of TB1 in the roots，stems，and leaves were similar between plants growing in Wensu County and those growing in the Tsaidam Basin. Endophytic fungi significantly reduced the expression of TB1 at the base of stems（the tillering site）. These results show that endophytic fungal infection affects the expression of the host’s TB1 gene，thereby regulating tillering.

In this study we examined the role of loline alkaloids in attracting certain bacteria to the rhizosphere of tall fescue plants that harbor loline producing fungal endophytes. Population studies were used to compare the fitness of known loline catabolizing strains to other rhizosphere bacteria. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA fragments compared the composition of bacterial communities inhabiting the endophyte infected tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) rhizosphere to those of endophyte free fescue plants. Rhizosphere population studies demonstrated that loline catabolizing strains Burkholderia ambifaria 7R and Pseudomonas aureofaciens outcompete and suppress the growth of non-loline catabolizing strains. Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA fragments showed greater percentages of certain plant growth promoting bacteria in rhizosperes seeded with B. ambifaria 7R than non-inoculated soils. Rhizospheres of endophyte infected plants showed higher species richness (Shannon diversity index = 4.03) over endophyte free rhizospheres (Shannon diversity index = 3.08) and a greater percentage of Firmicutes.

Preliminary screening indicated that most of the isolates could inhibit R. solani and F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici to the greater extent but failed to reduce mycelia growth of S. rolfsii by more than 50 percent. The only exceptions were 1PR7a, 2P2, and 2PR9b which were further characterized and evaluated against S. rolfsii. Molecular identification of 15 isolates based on 16s rRNA gene sequence similarity indicated the presence of three genera viz. Bacillus, Lysinibacillus, and Stenotrophomonas. In planta trial in tomato challenged with pathogen S. rolfsii in presence and absence of endophyte inoculation revealed that Bacillus sp. 2P2 showed the highest protection against S. rolfsii.

14886,"Endophytes are commonly defined as fungi that live asymptomatically within healthy plant tissue, such as leaves, stems or roots, for a part or all of their life cycle. The largest plant family hosting these endophytes is Poaceae. Studies on the grass-endophyte symbiosis indicate that endophytes can not only protect the host grass from abiotic stresses but also enhance its resistance to biotic disturbance, including herbivores, nematodes, bacteria and pathogens. However, the response of grass-endophyte symbiosis to fungal pathogens is less studied. Most previous reports on resistance of endophytes to pathogens have focused on inhibition of fungal pathogens by endophytes in vitro or by inoculation of fungal pathogens on detached leaves of the symbiont, and these studies have demonstrated that endophytes can inhibit growth of certain species of fungal pathogens to some degree. Up to now, only a few studies have centered on influence of endophyte infection on disease resistance of live plants. In this paper we used the endophyte Epichloë bromicola, which was isolated from Leymus chinensis. L. chinensis is a natural grass, widely distributed in the Inner Mongolian steppe. Three species of fungal pathogens were chosen, i.e. Curvularia lunata, Bipolaris sorokiniana and Cladosporium sp.. The experiment comprised three parts, i.e. fungal pathogens inhibition experiment by endophyte, infected detached leaves and infected intact plants experiments. The questions were: (1) whether E. bromicola could inhibit the growth of the three fungal pathogens in vitro, and (2) whether endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) plants differed in resistance to the pathogenic fungi in detached leaves and live plants of L. chinensis. The results suggested that E. bromicola significantly inhibited the growth of C. lunata, B. sorokiniana and C. sp. in vitro, but anti-fungal activities of the endophyte to different pathogenic fungi were different. The inhibition rates were 56.22, 46.93 and 45.15%, respectively. Culture filtrate of endophyte also effectively reduced pathogenic spore germination and the average germination rate were 30.4, 15.7 and 16.4%, respectively. The main antagonism mechanisms involved in competition and producing anti-fungal chemical compounds. As for our research, the main strategy was the latter. Leaf inoculation trial showed that all fungal pathogens were able to cause lesions on detached leaves regardless of endophyte status. Either the number or length of disease lesions on E+ L. chinensis leaves caused by C. lunata or C. sp. decreased compared with those on E- leaves. But lesion number and length of B. sorokiniana leaf spots were dramatically higher on E+ leaves compared with E- leaves. Detached leaves extraction inhibited three pathogens to varying degrees. The reason might be that some inhibitory substances differed in vitro and in the whole plant. The intact E+ leaves had greater resistance to all of three species of pathogens than E- leaves. The explanation may be that the defense of plant associated with endophyte increased through resistance enhancement and secondary metabolites production. In a word, the endophyte E. bromicola had a positive effect on disease resistance of the host plant. © 2014, Ecological Society of China.

The main objectives of current research were to (i) isolate and identify cultivable fungal wheat endophytes from healthy wheat plants grown in different regions in Jordan and to (ii) verify the endophytic characteristics through conducting invitro test on seeds and testing the germination success of seeds with and without endophyte. Wheat plants were collected from different wheat growing regions in northern, middle and southern Jordan. Fungal endophytes were isolated from wheat roots and aerial organs, including leaves, stems, and spikes using the cultivable dependent approach.

12282,"Parasitoid fitness is closely associated with the condition of the host insect, and the condition of the host is partly dependent on the quality and quantity of plant food available. The relationship between host diet and parasitoid fitness therefore has the potential to indirectly mediate complex multitrophic interactions. This relationship may be influenced both by the presence of mycotoxins from endophytic fungi, which share symbiotic relationships with plants and cause reductions in host-plant quality for herbivores, and by the availability of beneficial nutrient-rich plant foods such as pollen. This study used a multitrophic system involving ryegrass, a fungal endophyte, pollen, and an insect herbivore and its parasitoid to study the effect of host diet on parasitoid fitness. Previous studies showed that the larval stage of the parasitoid was negatively influenced by the presence of fungal-derived alkaloids in the diet of its host, but no assessment of effects on the adult stage of the parasitoid had been made. Similarly, the effect of pollen in the diet of the host on the fitness of the parasitoid had not previously been examined. In this study, the fitness of parasitoids reared from hosts fed endophyte-free ryegrass, endophyte-free ryegrass plus pollen, or endophyte-infected ryegrass was assessed in two laboratory experiments. Host insects exhibited significant responses to treatment, but remarkably, there were no significant treatment effects on parasitoid development times, the number of successful parasitoid emergences, tibia length, or preoviposition egg complement.

The interactions in plant-endophyte associations vary from mutualistic to parasitic with environmental conditions and the genotypes of interacting species.

Individual fungal endophytes significantly increased seed weight and lowered the accumulation of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol compared with F. graminearum-infected wheat heads without endophyte pretreatment. Investigation into the mechanism of competition in vitro showed that endophytes competitively excluded F. graminearum by preemptive colonization and possible inhibition over a distance. Investigations on the use of these endophytes in the field are in progress. Identification of these three endophytes highlights a common quandary in searching for beneficial microbes to use in agriculture: species definitions often do not separate individual isolates' lifestyles.

12462,"Leaf blades of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) plants infected with the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium coenophialum (= Acremonium coenophialum) have often been assumed to be endophyte-free. However, fungal colonies identified as N. coenophialum developed following incubation of surface-sterilised leaf blades from endophyte-infected tall fescues on antibiotic potato dextrose agar. A standardised fungal isolation technique was developed to assess the distribution of hyphae within tall fescue leaf blades in three USA-bred cultivars ('Georgia 5', 'Kentucky 31', 'Jesup') and a roadside population (MRSP) from the Manawatu region, New Zealand. Leaf blades of the three USA-bred cultivars were typically sparsely colonised. In contrast, extensively colonised leaf blades were present in many MRSP plants, particularly in autumn. Ergovaline concentrations of up to 3.9 ppm (mean 2.5) were present in leaf blades of the MRSP grown in a glasshouse. Ergovaline at lower concentrations (mean 0.4 ppm) was also detected in leaf blades of the tall fescue cultivars infected with their natural endophytes. These unusually high concentrations of hyphae and ergovaline observed within leaf blades of the MRSP provide an explanation of why fescue toxicosis has been especially severe in New Zealand. Significantly, N. coenophialum from plants of the MRSP was not uniform in cultural characteristics and conidial length, or in the ability to colonise leaf blades and produce ergovaline in artificially infected plants of four diverse tall fescue cultivars. The four inoculated cultivars ('Georgia 5', 'Grasslands Roa', 'Kentucky 31', 'KFa949') also differed in their interaction with N, coenophialum from MRSP. The most colonised leaf blades were in plants from an experimental cultivar of Mediterranean origin (KFa949), and, surprisingly, ergovaline concentrations were higher in the leaf blades than sheath. The New Zealand-bred tall fescue cultivar 'Grasslands Roa' was also distinctive in that no hyphae were detected in leaf blades. The concentration of ergovaline present in pooled leaf blades of 'Grasslands Roa' plants was lower than in those of the other naturally and artificially infected tall fescue/N. coenophialum populationsexamined in this study, reflecting the apparently low concentrations of hyphae present.",1998,Presence,Presence,3,6,Medium,endophyte-free,isolation; agar; observed,NA,surface-sterilised leaf blades from endophyte-infected tall fescues on antibiotic potato dextrose agar.

1172,"Aphids are major pests of cereal and pasture grasses throughout the world, vectoring disease and reducing plant production. There are few control options other than insecticides. Epichloe endophytes that produce loline alkaloids in their hosts provide a possible mechanism of control, with both meadow fescue and tall fescue naturally infected with loline-producing endophytes showing a resistance to Rhopalosiphum padi.

1448,"Microbial symbionts of plants can affect decomposition by altering the quality or quantity of host plant tissue (substrate) or the micro-environment where decomposition occurs (conditioning). In C-3 grasses, foliar fungal endophytes (Clavicipitaceae) can increase plant resistance to drought and/or produce alkaloids that reduce herbivory - effects that may also influence host litter composition and subsequent litter decomposition. We studied the effect of the endophyte Epichloe sp. on litter decomposition in the Great Lakes dunes (USA) using a reciprocal design altering endophyte presence/absence in both American beachgrass Ammophila breviligulata substrate (litter bags) and its conditioning of the decomposition microenvironment. Symbiont treatments were crossed with rain-out shelters that altered growing season precipitation. The first year of decomposition, senesced leaf substrate from A. breviligulata with Epichloe decomposed 21% faster than endophyte-free substrate. By the third year, conditioning by live symbiotic plants reduced cumulative decomposition by 33% compared to plots planted with endophyte-free plants. Of the traits we examined - litter quantity, C:N ratio, mineral composition, fungal colonization, and carbon chemistry - increased litter quantity via greater tiller production was the primary trait shift associated with endophyte symbiosis. Epichloe in A. breviligulata litter also altered litter nitrogen decomposition dynamics, as evidenced by lower nitrogen and protein content in decomposed tissue from plants that hosted the endophyte. Differences in initial litter quality and subsequent colonization by saprotrophic fungi were ruled out as key drivers. Altered precipitation had negligible effects on decomposing processes in the dunes. Grass-Epichloe symbiosis altered nutrient cycling through increasing the rate of litter decomposition when present in the litter and through reducing litter decomposition by conditioning the decomposition microenvironment.

20900,"Endophytes and their host grasses are mutually symbiotic. On one hand, the grasses provide photosynthates for the fungi; on the other hand, the endophytes may enhance the host's growth and protect the host from biotic stresses (such as mammalian, insect, and nematode herbivores) and abiotic stresses (such as drought and high temperature). In the past, much research work has been done on the beneficial effect of endophyte infection on biotic stress resistance of grasses. When abiotic stress, such as drought, was regarded, most research work focused on several agronomy indexes. Thus, in this paper Lolium perenne cv SR4000 infected by Neotyphodium lolii was chosen as experimental material. Relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll, soluble sugar and starch content of endophyte-infected (EI) and endophyte-free (EF) populations under normal and drought stress conditions were compared. EI seeds of Lolium perenne L. were used to attain EF population by heating the seeds at 43′C for 15 min and then 57′C for 25min. The experimental seedling was bred in winter during 1998, and then populations were constructed twice with ramets in April 1999 and April 2000 separately. EI and EF populations were transplanted into the soil column system designed for the experiment. Each system was comprised of a cylinder-shaped tinplate sleeve filled with soil and fixed in the ground. The : REN An-Zhi, Ph. D., Associate professor, System was 25cm in diameter and 60cm in depth. The top 0-25cm layer was filled with a compound of soil, sand and biological fertilizer (soil: sand: biological fertilizer = 18: 10: 1). Each column contained approximately 14.3kg oven-dried soil. Field capacity and permanent wilting point were 18.53% and 8.31% respectively. Eighteen column systems were made as required. The experimental populations were treated by cyclic drought stress where three stress levels were designed, i.e. control, mild and moderate level. The stress treatment period was from Sep. 29, 2000 to Nov. 7, 2000, and sustained for 40 days. In this period, the control set was watered once per six days; the mild stress set was watered on the 10 th, 25th and 40th day, respectively; and the moderate stress set was watered only once at the end of the period. When watered, all populations were watered to field capacity. When the stress period ended, the shoots were harvested, leaving a stubble height of about 4cm. The remaining plant parts lived through the winter in their natural condition. During the next spring, the regeneration characters of each population were investigated. A newly expanded leaf, or the second leaf down which had recently fully expanded, was taken for the determination of relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll, soluble sugar and starch content. The leaf samples were taken between 2:00 and 2:30 pm. The sampling work was carried out at three-day intervals. The results showed that RWC of EI leaves were close to that of EF leaves under controlled and mild stress, while under moderate stress, RWC of EI leaves was significantly higher than that of EF leaves, i.e. EI plants took more advantage over EF plants in water-holding ability. When carbohydrate accumulation was regarded, the endophyte could enhance soluble sugars in host plants to improve their osmotic ability under mild stress. With stress intensification, the improvement of the endophyte no longer existed, but at this time more photosynthetic products (such as starch) accumulated in EI plants, which could be beneficial for the host grass to survive through the undesirable conditions, such as winter. During the next spring, EI populations recovered more rapidly than EF populations. Especially after moderate drought stress treatment, EI populations had significantly more regeneration tillers than EF populations. The biomass of a population is closely related to its photosynthesis. Under moderate stress, EI populations accumulated significantly more biomass than EF populations, which suggests that endophyte infection could alleviate photosynthesis inhibition of drought stress on ryegrass. As far as photosynthesis pigments were concerned, contents of Chla, Chlb and Car of EI plants were close to those of EF plants, which showed that endophyte infection didn't protect photosynthesis pigments from being destroyed by drought stress, and the endophyte may improve photosynthesis ability of its host plant in other ways.",2005,Presence,Presence,3,5,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS; fixed; investigated,"material.

14709,"Plant microbial symbionts could play a significant role on aggregate stability, an important index for soil physical quality. So far there is little information available linking the presence of endophyte in the aboveground parts of plants, with aggregate stability of rhizosphere soil. We hypothesized that the presence of Epichloë coenophiala in the aboveground parts of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.=Schedonorus arundinaceus and Lolium arundinaceum) may alter the structural properties of rhizospheric soil. A greenhouse pot experiment was performed to evaluate the evidence for a relationship between endophyte-tall fescue symbiosis and rhizosphere aggregate stability for a range of soils. Traditional methods for measuring aggregate stability would not be able to distinguish the impacts of these biotic factors because they usually rely on rapid immersion of aggregates in water which is very disruptive. In this study, the aggregate stability was quantified by high energy moisture characteristic (HEMC) because HEMC is capable to accurately characterize small differences in aggregate stability among the treatments and soils. Clonally propagated tillers of tall fescue (genotype 75C) naturally infected with E. coenophiala (E+) and endophyte-free ones (E-) were used. Plants were grown under optimal water, light and temperature conditions. After eight months, when plants reached the maximum vegetative growth, intact soil aggregates adherent to plant roots (i.e. rhizosphere soil) and those free of root (i.e. bulk soil) were collected for HEMC determination. The HEMCs of slow and fast wetted aggregates were determined at high matric suctions of 0 to 50hPa. HEMC data was modeled using a modified van Genuchten function. Then, various indices including volume of drainable pores (VDP), relative VDP (RVDP), VDP ratio (VDPR), modal suction (hmodal), relative hmodal (Rhmodal), stability index (SI), relative SI (RSI), stability ratio (SR), relative SR (RSR), slope at the inflection point (Si), and inflection point slope ratio (SiR) were derived to characterize soil structural stability. Endophyte presence was correlated with increased soil organic carbon (SOC) pools especially for the fine-textured soils. Changes in the SOC storage of rhizosphere soil altered the structural stability and increased the SR. The effect of endophyte infection on SR of the rhizosphere soil was also more evident in medium- and fine-textured soils due to physical protection of SOC. Lower values of hmodal and higher values of VDP of fast wetted aggregates revealed more stable macropores and greater aggregate stability in the E+ rhizosphere soil vs. E- one. VDPR, SR and SiR values of rhizosphere soil were greater in E+ plants associated soils. Fine-textured soils had lower values of SiR because of their greater values of Si in the slow wetting treatment. Plant root presence could improve the soil structure compared to the bulk soil due to exudation of cementing materials; values greater than 1 for RVDP, RSI and RSR indicate that plant root enhanced the structural stability of rhizosphere soil. In contrast to stability ratio, the effects of Epichloë endophyte-tall fescue symbiosis on relative structural stability indices such as RVDP, Rhmodal, RSI, and RSR were more pronounced in coarse- and medium-textured soils.

11338,"Tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) forms a mutualistic relationship with the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum. The endophyte provides constitutive resistance to herbivores through its production of alkaloid compounds. Moreover, herbivore attack induces elevated synthesis of loline alkaloids, that is, the fungus also provides wound-inducible resistance for its host. Jasmonic acid and its conjugates are key signaling compounds in many plant species and play a role systemically in the upregulation of defensive compounds within plants following attack by herbivores. The purpose of our study was to determine if and how the plant and fungus respond to methyl jasmonate (MJ) exposure and if these responses interact in antagonistic or synergistic ways. Plants were exposed to MJ via gaseous diffusion within a controlled environment chamber. Response to MJ was assessed with an herbivore bioassay, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to quantify alkaloids, and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to quantify mRNA from a loline alkaloid biosynthesis gene. We found that MJ hindered endophyte-infected tall fescue's resistance against aphids by downregulating transcription of the LolC gene. The opposite pattern was observed for endophyte-free tall fescue; its exposure to MJ resulted in a significant increase in resistance to aphids, apparently through stimulating defense compounds produced by the plant.

The objective was to determine whether a thermal or heat-tolerant Bos taurus breed of cattle, Romosinuano (RO), would tolerate EI TF toxins relative to Angus (AN) cattle. Milk production and quality were examined on AN and RO cows grazing endophyte-free (EF; variety K-31; n = 36) or EI TF (variety K-31; n = 37) along with growth of their Charolais-sired calves in 2007 and 2008 in west central Arkansas. Cows calved between early February and late March (spring). Milk yield and quality, BW, rectal temperature, and serum prolactin were determined at 57.1 +/- 2.6 d postpartum and every 28 d thereafter between April and August.

However, it is unclear how E. gansuensis affects the assembly of host plant-associated bacterial communities after ammonium nitrogen (NH4(+)-N) treatment. We examined the shoot- and root-associated bacterial microbiota and root metabolites of A. inebrians when infected (I) or uninfected (F) with E. gansuensis endophyte. The results showed more pronounced NH4(+)-N-induced microbial and metabolic changes in the endophyte-infected plants compared to the endophyte-free plants. E. gansuensis significantly altered bacterial community composition and beta-diversity in shoots and roots and increased bacterial alpha-diversity under NH4(+)-N treatment. The relative abundance of 117 and 157 root metabolites significantly changed with E. gansuensis infection under water and NH4(+)-N treatment compared to endophyte-free plants. Root bacterial community composition was significantly related to the abundance of the top 30 metabolites [variable importance in the projection (VIP) > 2 and VIP > 3] contributing to differences between I and F plants, especially alkaloids.

2399,"Aims To explore if and how symbiotic Phomopsis liquidambari-rice system influences below-ground straw decomposition and then nitrogen(N) transformation in response to environmental N levels. Methods and Results Litter bag experiments were utilized to trace the decay process during rice growth phases (seedling (T1), tillering (T2), heading (T3) and maturing (T4) stage), with (E+) and without endophyte (E-), under low (LN), medium (MN) and high nitrogen (HN) supply. Litter, soil and plant samples were collected to evaluate the decay process, N transformations, plant quality and relative abundance of soil ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and P. liquidambari. The results showed that straw decomposition increased by 19 center dot 76% (LN, T2 stage), 14 center dot 05% (MN, T3 stage) and 16 center dot 88% (MN, T4 stage) in E+ pots when compared with E- pots. Further analysis revealed that no significant endophyte x N interaction was found for straw decay rate and that the decay rate was reduced by a higher N supply (LN, 37 center dot 16 +/- 0 center dot 65%; MN, 32 center dot 27 +/- 1 center dot 72%; HN, 29 center dot 44 +/- 1 center dot 22%) at the T1 stage, whereas straw decay rate and N release increased by 9 center dot 38 and 11 center dot 16%, respectively, mainly by endophyte colonization at the T4 stage. The abundance of AOA and AOB were altered, corresponding with the decay rate. Soil mineral N, straw mineral N and plant quality were shown to increase in E+ pots, depending on environmental N conditions and growth phase.

2411,"Fungal endophyte (Epichloe coenophiala) usually infects cool-season perennial forage grasses and enhances host plant resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and, by potentially altering the litter quality and decomposition rate, can affect soil properties. Aggregate stability, as an important determinant of plant root growth and soil quality, may be affected by the endophyte status of plant residues. In this study, the effects of endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) tall fescue residues (0%, 1% and 2%) on soil organic carbon (SOC), basal soil respiration (BSR) and aggregate stability were investigated in four texturally different soils in the laboratory. The aggregate stability indices were determined by the high energy moisture characteristic (HEMC) method. Moist soil samples were thoroughly mixed with either E+ or E- tall fescue residues before being incubated at 25 degrees C. During the 2-month incubation period, the amended soil samples were subjected to ten wetting and drying cycles, after which soil properties were measured. The results indicated that SOC and aggregate stability were higher and that BSR was lower in the finer-textured soils. Furthermore, an increase in the application rate of plant residues significantly increased SOC, BSR and aggregate stability. Treating the soils with E+ tall fescue residues increased SOC and aggregate stability (i.e., stability ratio, SR, a dimensionless index defined as the ratio of the structural index for the fast wetting to the structural index for the slow wetting), and significantly decreased BSR due to the toxic effects of phenolic compounds on soil microbial communities and changes in the litter chemical quality. The interactive effect of soil type and endophyte status on the SOC and BSR values was significant but no clear trend was observed. Our findings indicated that tall fescue residues (especially E+ ones) can improve soil physical quality due to increased SOC storage and greater aggregate stability.

This study examined how feeding on perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) with (E+) or without (E-) its alkaloid-producing fungal endophyte, Neotyphodium lolii, affects susceptibility of a grass-feeding caterpillar to a baculovirus. In separate experiments, black cutworms (Agrotis ipsilon) were reared on E+ or E- grass that had been sprayed with different rates of A. ipsilon multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AgipMNPV), or were droplet-fed a single dose of the virus while developing on those grasses. Larvae grew more quickly on E- than on E+ grass, and mortality from virus increased at higher doses, but there was no endophyte x virus interaction in either trial. Despite larger size, larvae that fed ad libitum on virus-sprayed E- grass died more quickly than counterparts feeding on virus-sprayed E+ ryegrass, but such an effect was not seen when the virus was consumed as a single dose. Together, the results suggest that feeding on E+ grass neither compromises nor synergizes infectivity of AgipMNPV in the A. ipsilon midgut. Reduced consumption or avoidance of less-palatable E+ grass could, however, decrease ingestion of virus and rates of subsequent mortality in the field. Net benefits of integrating endophytic grasses and baculoviruses for managing A. ipsilon may depend on the extent to which reduced intake of virus on E+ grass is counterbalanced by slower growth and increased mortality from other natural enemies.

New cultivars of tall fescue are continually developed to improve pasture productivity and animal health by manipulating both grass and E. coenophiala genetics, yet how these selected grass-endophyte combinations impact other microbial symbionts such as mycorrhizal and dark septate fungi remains unclear. Without better characterizing how genetically distinct grass-endophyte combinations interact with belowground microorganisms, we cannot determine how adoption of new E. coenophiala-symbiotic cultivars in pasture systems will influence long-term soil characteristics and ecosystem function. Here, we examined how E. coenophiala presence and host x endophyte genetic combinations control root colonization by belowground symbiotic fungi and associated plant nutrient concentrations and soil properties in a 2-year manipulative field experiment. We used four vegetative clone pairs of tall fescue that consisted of one endophyte-free (E-) and one E. coenophiala-symbiotic (E+) clone each, where E+ clones within each pair contained one of four endophyte genotypes: CTE14, CTE45, NTE16, or NTE19.

Although we observed no effects of E. coenophiala presence or symbiotic genotype on total AMF or DSE colonization rates in roots, different grass-endophyte combinations altered AMF arbuscule presence and extraradical hyphal length in soil. The CTE45 genotype hosted the fewest AMF arbuscules regardless of endophyte presence, and E+ clones within NTE19 supported significantly greater soil extraradical hyphae compared to E- clones.

12854,"Tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceous (Schreb.)) is often infected with a common toxic fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum) capable of producing alkaloids that affect grazing animal health, insect herbivory, plant production, and litter decomposition. The strength of these endophyte-associated effects is thought to depend on the abiotic and biotic conditions of a specific site. Prior work from Georgia, USA, has demonstrated that fungal endophyte infection can increase soil carbon pools of tall fescue pastures: however, for endophyte infection to contribute substantially to regional carbon sequestration, this result would have to hold true across the broad range of environmental conditions that support tall fescue growth. In this study, we evaluated whether endophyte infection consistently alters various soil parameters, including carbon storage, of tall fescue stands located throughout the southeastern United States. Soil samples were collected from nine sites with established paired high- and low- endophyte-infected tall fescue stands. These samples were analyzed for basic soil parameters, soil organic carbon (SOC), soil total nitrogen (TN), particulate and non-particulate organic matter-C and -N (POM, n-POM), C and N mineralization rates, and microbial biomass and community composition. Averaged across all sites, endophyte-infected tall fescue stands had 6% greater SOC and 5% greater TN pools in surface soil than adjacent endophyte-free stands. The lack of a significant interaction between site and endophyte infection status indicated that this result was relatively consistent across sites, despite differences in stand age, climate, and other environmental conditions. While POM C and POM N tended to be higher in endophyte-infected than endophyte-free stands, this result was not significant. However, greater pools of n-POM C and N were observed in endophyte-infected vs. endophyte-free stands when averaged across all the sites, suggesting increased retention of recalcitrant substrates occurred in response to fungal endophyte infection. Total microbial biomass, measured via phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, was greater in endophyte-infected than endophyte-free soils when averaged across sites, reflecting the trends observed with SOC and TN. Microbial community composition shifted somewhat in response to fungal endophyte infection: significantly higher fungal to bacterial ratios were observed in endophyte-free compared to endophyteinfected stands. However, ordinations of the PLFA data demonstrated only slight separation of endophyte-infected and endophyte-free microbial communities at some sites and no clear separation at others. Enhanced SOC. TN, recalcitrant n-POM C and N pools, and altered microbial biomass and communities suggest that this aboveground fungal endophyte symbiosis has widespread effects on soil biology and biochemistry, and that high prevalence of the aboveground endophyte increases C sequestration capacity of tall fescue stands throughout the southeastern USA.

15534,"Plant-endophyte associations play important roles in grassland agricultural ecology. Many studies indicate that endophytic fungi can promote host growth and reduce the biotic and abiotic stresses of host plants. Epichloë endophytes of the family Clavicitaceae are fungal symbionts of Pooideae grasses. These endophytes usually do not express any obvious host symptoms. Many Epichloë endophytes can endow hosts with increased abiotic stress tolerance as a result of enhanced growth, tillering, reproduction and nutrient acquisition, particularly under conditions of drought, cold, salt and nutrient deficiencies and thus, have important roles in pastoral agricultural systems. Animal-safe grass-endophyte associations that confer bio-protective properties for increased pasture persistence and productivity have been developed and commercialized. Artificial inoculation with symbiotic Epichloë microbes is an important technique for the creation of novel germplasm. Selected Epichloë strains can add value to some grass-based forage systems by providing both biotic and abiotic stress resistance. In addition, they can improve and strengthen grass physiological functions and plant vigor. The Epichloë bromicola WBE1 endophyte of Hordeum brevisubulatum played an important role in maintaining the growth of host grass by promoting nutrient absorption and maintaining the ionic balance under salt stress. E. bromicola WBE1 can produce peramine, an alkaloid produced by Epichloë species, that protects host grasses from herbivorous insects. However, this strain was unable to synthesize the alkaloids that are toxic to livestock, such as ergine, ergonovine, ergovaline or lolitrem B. Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is one of the most important cereal crops. The importance of barley to human and animal nutrition, and indeed to the foundation and maintenance of human civilization, is well documented. Traditional barley breeding for improved environmental stress tolerance has resulted in good varieties. However, conventional breeding techniques neglect the microorganisms in plants. In this study, animal-safe endophytic E. bromicola WBE1 isolated from wild barley (H. brevisubulatum) was artificially inoculated into cultivated hulled barley (H. vulgare cv. Yangsimai No. 1) and hull-less barley (H. vulgare var. nudum cv. Chaiqing No. 1), creating novel barley germplasm. Plants that were inoculated with endophytes and those that were free of endophytes were evaluated for growth in the field. The plant height, tiller numbers, biomass and the grain weight per plant of endophyte-inoculated hulled barley plants (Yangsimai No. 1) were 5%, 20%, 46% and 22% higher than those of the control hulled barley plants, respectively, and they matured about 5 days earlier. The tiller numbers, biomass and grain weight per plant of endophyte-inoculated hull-less barley plants (Chaiqing No. 1) were 29%, 37% and 28% higher, respectively, than those of the control hull-less barley plants in the field. However, there was no significant difference between inoculated hull-less barley plants and control hullless barley plants in the plant height and growth period. A novel germplasm of barley containing the endophyte was successfully created. E. bromicola improves plant characteristics and the growth of host. The results presented here provide evidence that the inoculation of barley with E. bromicola may be used to improve its germplasm. E. bromicola can be successfully inoculated into other phylogenetically close host species, and this technique has the potential to improve the growth of Hordeae cereal crops and serve as a broad application to produce agriculturally useful synthetic novel symbioses in germplasm. © 2021, Science Press.

12355,"The presence of the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) confers resistance to some plant-parasitic nematodes but also results in the production of ergot alkaloids. Recently, new strains of N. coenophialum have been isolated from wild tall fescue and artificially inoculated into elite tall fescue cultivars. These strains produce low to nil levels of ergot alkaloids and are referred to as non-ergot strains. Our objective was to determine whether non-ergot strains of the endophyte confer the same level of resistance to Pratylenchus spp. as the endemic strain in tall fescue. In a glasshouse experiment, nematode resistance was compared in two fescue cultivars (Jesup and Georgia 5) infected with either the endemic strain (E(+)), or two non-ergot strains, AR542 and AR584. An additional non-ergot strain, AR514, was tested only in cv. Jesup. Cultivars Georgia 5 and Jesup without endophytes (E(-)) were used as controls.

Lolium persicum, a self-pollinating annual grass, is suggested for studying such an interaction.AbstractMost grasses host endophytic fungi, co-evolved organisms that can interact with their hosts from antagonism to mutualism. This study examined the impact of mating systems on host-endophyte interactions by utilizing endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) populations of self-pollinating Lolium persicum and open-pollinating Lolium rigidum, collected from three regions of Iran. The evaluations in a pre-breeding process and two experiments were conducted on 1400 plants screened to select 126 half-sib (L. rigidum) and full-sib (L. persicum) families based on a limited space stress, morphological traits, and seed dormancy, respectively. It was found that endophytes generally have a significant and positive effect on reproductive traits and promoting effects in plants to strive for survival. Their impacts were population-dependent, and the E+ plants were superior when a population had higher biomass production and seed yield-related traits. Endophytes help to maintain the host's genetic structure over generations, particularly in L. persicum. In this way, E+ populations exhibited the highest heritability and genetic advance for endophyte-host survival traits such as seed weight, number of seeds, plant height, and days to tillering in both species. In L. persicum, this also included acid-detergent fiber, neutral detergent fiber, crude protein, fat content, phosphorus content, number of tillers, and days to emergence.

2519,"Invasive, exotic grasses are increasing in tallgrass prairie and their dominance may be contributing to the decline of grassland butterflies through alterations in forage quality. Tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.) Dumort.), an exotic grass covering millions of acres in the United States, can host a fungal endophyte, Epichloe coenophiala (Morgan-Jones & Gams). Alkaloids produced by the endophyte are known to be toxic to some foliar-feeding pest insects. Endophyte-infected tall fescue is commonly planted in hayfields, pastures, lawns, and is invading natural areas, but effects of the endophyte on nonpest insects such as butterflies are relatively unknown. Our objective was to investigate the role that tall fescue and its endophyte might play in the decline of grass skippers (Hesperiidae). We examined growth and survival parameters of tawny-edged skippers (Polites themistocles (Latreille)) that were reared on endophyte-infected tall fescue (E+), endophyte-free tall fescue (E-), and Kentucky bluegrass (KBG). KBG was included as a comparison because it is a cool season grass known to be palatable to P. themistocles larvae. Interestingly, results showed that the endophyte did not affect growth and survival of larvae compared to uninfected tall fescue, even though significant amounts of loline alkaloids (average 740 ppm) were measured in endophyte-infected plant material.

12167,"Neotyphodium, a seed-transmissible nonpathogenic fungal endophyte (symbiont) is considered beneficial because endophyte-infected grasses are more drought-tolerant, produce more dry matter, utilize soil nitrogen more efficiently, and deter insects. In this study, the effects of endophytes on physiological mechanisms of drought tolerance in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) were studied in a greenhouse. Two clonally propagated genotypes of tall fescue (F. arundinacea Schreb.), naturally containing endophyte (EI), and their endophyte-free ramets (EF) were tested at three water stress treatments exerted by PEG 6000 in a hydroponics system. Relative water content (RWC), cell membrane stability (CMS), proline and chlorophyll contents in plant leaves were measured during water stress treatments. After harvest, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ contents were measured in plant roots and shoots. After 20 days under stress conditions, plants were transferred to basal hydroponics medium, and their survival after stress relief was evaluated. The results showed that endophyte considerably contributes to host grass water stress tolerance. Both genotypes of EI and EF plants did not differ in RWC, but, regardless of the infection status, genotype 75 had the higher RWC than genotype 83. EI clones of both genotypes maintained slightly higher chlorophyll content and membrane stability than EF clones, although these differences were not significant. The EI plants of genotype 83 concentrated significantly more proline than EF plants, but in the genotype 75, differences between EI and EF clones were not significant. Plant mineral absorption was also influenced by the endophyte presence. EI clones had the higher concentrations of K+ in the shoots of both genotypes. The Mg2+ and Ca2+ contents in EF plants of both genotypes were higher than EI plants in the roots, but in the shoots there were no differences between EI and EF clones.

1254,"Plant -fungal endophyte interactions are common in nature and they can shape the ecology of plants. Vertically transmitted endophytes are hypothesized to serve as mutualists, protecting plants from herbivores. If this hypothesis is true, then we expect endophytes to be most abundant in the presence of herbivores and least abundant in their absence, assuming endophytes incur a cost to their host. We tested this prediction by studying the effects of intense rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus Linnaeus) grazing on grass-endophyte interactions at Silwood Park, UK. We examined seeds of red fescue (Festuca rubra L.) collected from 15 natural populations that were protected from rabbits for 0.3-21 years. Contrary to our prediction, the mean proportion of seeds with endophytes increased 1.84x, from 0.45 to 0.83, following 21 years of rabbit exclusion. To better understand the mechanisms driving this increase in frequency, we conducted a fully factorial greenhouse experiment where we manipulated the presence or absence of endophyte infection, intraspecific competition, and simulated grazing on F. rubra plants. In both damaged and undamaged treatments, infected plants produced approximately twice as much biomass as uninfected plants, and endophytes did not influence tolerance to herbivory. These results suggest that endophytes directly change plant growth but not compensatory responses to damage. In the absence of competitors, infected plants produced 2.17x more biomass than uninfected plants, whereas in the presence of competitors, infected plants produced only 1.55x more biomass than uninfected plants. This difference suggests that intraspecific competition might lessen the benefits of endophyte infection.

A buffer containing VFA was incubated in the following sequence: control (CON), 15 μg ergovaline·kg BW(-1) (1×EXT) from a tall fescue seed extract, and 45 μg ergovaline·kg BW(-1) (3×EXT). For each buffer treatment there were two 30-min incubations: a 30-min incubation of a treatment buffer with no sampling followed by an incubation of an identical sampling buffer with the addition of Cr-EDTA and deuterium oxide (D2O). Epithelial blood flow was calculated as ruminal clearance of D2O corrected for influx of physiological water and liquid outflow.

Nevertheless, little attention was paid to whether an inducible endophyte can locate into non-host plant tissues, and how it influences plant physiological mechanisms still remains unclear. In the present study, we attempted to inoculate the endophyte into rice, hypothesizing that inducible endophytes could have particular beneficial effects on non-host plants. Inoculation and infection tests proved that the endophyte established a symbiotic relationship with the rice plant and existed in the leaf tissue. Then we tested the hypothesis in two ways. First, the effects of diluted endophyte inoculum on the germination of seeds were evaluated. Second, at the seedling stage (4-leaf stage), seedlings in pots were treated with the endophyte inoculum under controlled environmental conditions.

5161,"Changes in microbial communities associated with nematode control were studied by comparing population numbers of fungi and bacteria in the soil and in internal root tissues (endorhiza) in non-amended and chitin-amended soils. Addition of chitin to soil at 1% (w/w) eliminated plant-parasitic nematodes in a first planting of cotton cv. 'Rowden' and significantly reduced Meloidogyne incognita infestation in a second planting, confirming long-term nematode suppressiveness induced by this organic amendment. The chitin amendment was associated with an increase in fungal and bacterial populations, especially those with chitinolytic activity. The bacterial communities of soil, rhizosphere and endorhiza were assessed by examining the taxonomic diversity of recoverable bacteria based on identification with fatty acid analysis of sample sizes of 35 soil and rhizosphere bacteria and 25 endophytic bacteria. All major bacterial species which formed at least 2% of the total population in non-amended soils and rhizospheres also occurred with chitin amendment. In contrast, chitin-amended soils and rhizospheres yielded several species which were not found without chitin amendment, including Aureobacterium testaceum, Corynebacterium aquaticum and Rathayibacter tritici. Burkholderia cepacia was recovered from both amended and non-amended soils and rhizospheres, but it was most abundant with chitin amendment at the end of the first cotton planting. Soil was probably the major source for bacterial endophytes of cotton roots, since nearly all endophytic bacteria were also found in the soil or rhizosphere.

17580,"Ergovaline has been extensively used to study vasoactive effects of endophyte- (Neotyphodium coenophialum) infected tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum). However, initial results indicated that an extract of toxic tall fescue seed (E+EXT) is more potent than ergovaline alone in a right ruminal artery and vein bioassay. The E+EXT induced a greater contractile response than an equal concentration of ergovaline alone in the ruminal artery of heifers (P = 0.018). This led to a hypothesis that other compounds in the seed extract contribute to vasoconstriction. Thus, experiments were conducted to determine if vasoactivity of an E+EXT is different from a mixture of ergot alkaloids (ALK; ergovaline, ergotamine, ergocristine, ergocryptine, ergocornine, ergonovine, and lysergic acid) of similar concentrations and to determine if the vasoactivity of an E+EXT differs from an endophyte-free tall fescue seed extract (E-EXT). Segments of lateral saphenous vein and right ruminal artery and vein were collected from Holstein steers (n = 6) shortly after slaughter. Vessels were cleaned of excess connective tissue and fat and sliced into segments that were suspended in a multimyograph chamber with 5 mL of continually oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer, equilibrated for 90 min, and exposed to a reference compound (120 mM KCl for ruminal vessels and 0.1 mM norepinephrine for saphenous vein). Increasing concentrations of each treatment (E+EXT, E-EXT, ALK, and ergovaline) were added to the respective chamber every 15 min after buffer replacement. Data were normalized as a percentage of maximal contractile response of the reference compound and fit to a sigmoidal concentration response curve. Ergovaline, ALK, and E+EXT induced similar responses in the saphenous vein, ruminal artery, and ruminal vein.

These isolates were identified as Fusarium solani and Alternaria tenuissima, respectively, based on morphological characteristics and sequence analysis of internal transcribed spacer, TEF1, ATPase, and CAL regions. Subsequently, G. glabra plants were inoculated with these fungal isolates to examine their effect on glycyrrhizin production, plant growth parameters and the expression of key genes involved in glycyrrhizin pathway: SQS1, SQS2, bAS, CAS, LUS, CYP88D6, and CYP72A154. Endophytes were able to enhance glycyrrhizin content by 133%-171% in the plants. Natural control (NC) plants, harboring all natural endophytes, had better growth compared to SGGF14- and SGGF21-inoculated and endophyte-free (EF) plants.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the detrimental effects of feeding E+ to mares during early gestation. Mares (n = 12) paired by stage of gestation (d 65 to 100) were assigned to diets (six per diet) consisting of endophyte-free (E-) or E+ tall fescue seed (50% E- or E+ tall fescue seed, 45% sweet feed, and 10% molasses fed at 1.0% of BW/d).

We evaluated plant biomass, root length and nitrogen concentration, and we assessed intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE) and its components net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance, by carbon and oxygen isotope analysis of shoot tissues. Endophyte-free plants produced more biomass than endophyte-associated ones at field capacity, while water deficit strongly reduced endophyte-free plants biomass. As a result, both types of plants produced similar biomass under water restriction. Based on oxygen isotope composition of plant cellulose, stomatal conductance decreased with water deficit in both endophyte-associated and endophyte-free plants. Meanwhile, carbon isotope composition indicated that iWUE increased with water deficit only in endophyte-associated plants.

However, like many plants, T. vulgaris faces challenges such as drought stress, which significantly affects its growth, morphological, physiological, and biochemical processes. Understanding how endophytic fungi isolated from Lamiaceae family influence T. vulgaris under varying watering regimes can enhance its resilience against drought stress. This study aims to assess the impact of individual and co-inoculation of three native endophytic species, i.e., Fusarium sp. (F1), Cladosporium puyae (F2), and Curvularia australiensis (F3), on T. vulgaris growth parameters under different irrigation regimes in greenhouse conditions.ResultsIt has been discovered that using fungal endophytes as a biological tool can benefits T. vulgaris under drought stress. The results indicated that drought stress significantly reduced the growth, chlorophyll, and carotenoid content of plants lacking endophytes. Combinatory applications with fungal endophytes significantly improved the above-mentioned parameters under drought stress. Lipid peroxidation levels were significantly reduced in plants inoculated with bacterial endophytes. Drought stress significantly increased the activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) in drought conditions.ConclusionsThe findings suggested that the addition of fungal endophytes to the inoculum enhances drought tolerance in T. vulgaris by mitigating the harmful impact of drought stress on plant growth and physiological functions.

5152,"Epichloe endophytes have been shown to be mutualistic symbionts of cool-season grasses under most environmental conditions. Although pairwise interactions between hemiparasites and their hosts are heavily affected by host-associated symbiotic microorganisms, little attention has been paid to the effects of microbe-plant interactions, particularly endophytic symbiosis, in studies examining the effects of parasitic plants on host performance. In this study, we performed a greenhouse experiment to examine the effects of hereditary Epichloe endophyte symbiosis on the growth of two host grasses (Stipa purpurea and Elymus tangutorum) in the presence or absence of a facultative root hemiparasite (Pedicularis kansuensis Maxim). We observed parasitism of both hosts by P. kansuensis: when grown with a host plant, the hemiparasite decreased the performance of the host while improving its own biomass and survival rate of the hemiparasite. Parasitized endophyte-infected S. purpurea plants had higher biomass, tillers, root:shoot ratio, and photosynthetic parameters and a lower number of functional haustoria than the endophyte-free S. purpurea conspecifics. By contrast, parasitized endophyte-infected E. tangutorum had a lower biomass, root:shoot ratio, and photosynthetic parameters and a higher number of haustoria and functional haustoria than their endophyte-free counterparts.

Both laboratory and field strains of H. armigera moths oviposited more on leaves of A. strictum inoculated plants as compared to endophyte-free plants, both in free flight cages and in tethered moth laboratory experiments; the moth's preferences were significant between 10 and 18 days after inoculation. The analysis of volatile profiles showed strong quantitative differences between treatments. Endophyte inoculated plants emitted diverse terpenes and sesquiterpenes at significantly lower amounts as compared to endophyte free-plants, except for alpha-terpinene, which did not differ between the treatments, and trans-beta-caryophyllene, which was emitted in significantly higher amounts on inoculated plants. beta-Thujene and alpha-phellandrene accounted for 73.3 and 12.0% of total amounts of volatiles emitted from endophyte-free and inoculated plants, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that A. strictum is able to systemically influence the host selection of H. armigera moths for oviposition; conceivably mediated by the induced changes in volatile emissions (and probably additional biochemical parameters of the host plants, which have not been analysed so far).

Measurements included leaf relative leaf water content, chlorophyll content, peroxidase (POD) activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, proline (Pro) and soluble sugar (SS) of the perennial ryegrass. Changes in physiological indices such as SS content were examined to determine the effects of SA and endophytic fungi on perennial ryegrass under drought stress. It was found that the relative water content, chlorophyll content, POD activity and SS content of E+ were significantly higher (P<0.05) than those of E- L. perenne plants under drought stress. The addition of exogenous SA increased the relative water content, chlorophyll content, POD and SOD activities, and Pro and SS contents, while decreasing MDA content.

2813,"Background and Aims, Neotyphodium lolii is a fungal endophyte of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), improving grass fitness through production of bioactive alkaloids. Neotyphodium species can also affect growth and physiology of their host grasses (family Poaceae, sub-family Pooideae), but little is known about the mechanisms. This study examined the effect of N. lolii on net photosynthesis (P.) and growth rates in ryegrass genotypes differing in endophyte concentration in all leaf tissues. 9 Methods Plants from two ryegrass genotypes, Nui D and Nui UIV, infected with N. lolii (E+) differing approx. 2-fold in endophyte concentration or uninfected clones thereof (E-) were grown in a controlled environment. For each genotype X endophyte treatment, plant growth rates were assessed as tillering and leaf extension rates, and the light response of P-n, dark respiration and transpiration measured in leaves of young (30-45 d old) and old (> 90 d old) plants with a single-chamber open infrared gas-exchange system. Key Results Neotyphodium lolii affected CO2-limited rates Of Pn, which were approx. 17% lower in E+ than E- plants (P < 0.05) in the young plants. Apparent photon yield and dark respiration were unaffected by the endophyte (P > 0.05). Neotyphodium lolii also decreased transpiration (P < 0.05), but only in complete darkness. There were no endophyte effects on Pn in the old plants (P > 0.05). E+ plants grew faster immediately after replanting (P < 0.05), but had approx. 10 % lower growth rates during mid-log growth (P < 0.05) than E- plants, but there was no effect on final plant biomass (P > 0.05). The endophyte effects on P. and growth tended to be more pronounced in Nui UIV, despite having a lower endophyte concentration than Nui D. Conclusions Neotyphodium lolii affects CO2 fixation, but not light interception and photochemistry of P..

Other benefits, as enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses have been reported to some diazotrophs. Here we aim to study the effects of the association between the diazotroph Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus PAL5 and sugarcane cv. SP70-1143 during water depletion by characterizing differential transcriptome profiles of sugarcane. RNA-seq libraries were generated from roots and shoots of sugarcane plants free of endophytes that were inoculated with G. diazotrophicus and subjected to water depletion for 3 days. A sugarcane reference transcriptome was constructed and used for the identification of differentially expressed transcripts. The differential profile of non-inoculated SP70-1143 suggests that it responds to water deficit stress by the activation of drought-responsive markers and hormone pathways, as ABA and Ethylene. qRT-PCR revealed that root samples had higher levels of G. diazotrophicus 3 days after water deficit, compared to roots of inoculated plants watered normally. With prolonged drought only inoculated plants survived, indicating that SP70-1143 plants colonized with G. diazotrophicus become more tolerant to drought stress than non-inoculated plants. Strengthening this hypothesis, several gene expression responses to drought were inactivated or regulated in an opposite manner, especially in roots, when plants were colonized by the bacteria. The data suggests that colonized roots would not be suffering from stress in the same way as non-inoculated plants. On the other hand, shoots specifically activate ABA-dependent signaling genes, which could act as key elements in the drought resistance conferred by G. diazotrophicus to SP70-1143.

12593,"Managing soil water and water uptake by plant roots is more crucial in the arid and semi-arid regions comparing to the other places. Beside the well-known plant available water (PAW) concept, integral energy (E-l) is recently suggested to quantify the energy required by plants for water uptake. A greenhouse study was conducted to examine the effect of aboveground fungal endophyte infection (Epichloe coenophiala) in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. =Schedonorus arundinaceus and Lolium arundinaceum) on soil water availability indices such as PAW and E-l in six texturally-different soils. The PAW was calculated as the difference between field capacity, theta(FC) [at matric suction, h, of 100 or 330 hPa (1 hPa =0.1 kPa)] and permanent wilting point, theta(PWP) (nominal value at h of 15000 hPa or actual h value determined in the greenhouse experiment). The E-l was computed by integration of soil water retention curve (determined using undisturbed soil samples) over the nominal and actual PAW ranges. The results indicated that h(PWP), the matric suction at actual permanent wilting point, of tall fescue is considerably greater than the conventional value (i.e., 15000 hPa) and its value was greater in endophyte-infected (E+) plant associated soils compared to endophyte-free (E-) ones (27572 hPa/2757 kPa for E+ vs. 21780 hPa/2178 kPa for E-) and the difference was greater in the coarse- to medium-textured soils. Moreover, E+ treatments, especially in the coarse- and medium-textured soils, had greater values of actual PAW and El. This shows that E+ plants were able to tolerate higher h values at similar conditions presumably due to induced drought-tolerance mechanisms. The effect of endophyte presence on increment of PAW(actual) and E-l(actual) in comparison with nominal values was much more evident in the coarse- and medium textured soils. This indicates that the error in calculations of the PAW and E-l values by considering theta(PWP) at h= 15000 hPa is relatively smaller in fine-textured soils. Nevertheless, nominal E, values were lower for E+ treatments indicating that in similar PAW, the plant needed lower energy to take up water from the PAW range because endophyte presence can affect soil water release path in the PAW range. Greater contribution of structural pores to water retention in E+ plant associated soils compared to E ones was related to greater sub-critical water repellency and aggregate stability and better physical quality in E+ plant associated soils. It is concluded that the presence of endophyte in tall fescue, especially in coarse- and medium-textured soils, affects soil water release path, increases PAW and thereby might raise water productivity in drought periods.

However, in endophyte-infected E. ovatus plants from New Zealand, analogs of the indole-diterpenoid paxilline (thought to be a biosynthetic precursor of the lolitrems and related tremorgens) were detected by ELISA, and N-formylloline was detected by gas chromatography. Endophyte-free specimens of New Zealand E. ovatus did not contain detectable paxilline analogs or lolines and were more palatable than infected specimens to adults of the pasture pest Listronotus bonariensis (Argentine stem weevil).

4536,"Mulberry (Morus) is an economically important woody tree that is suitable for use in sericulture as forage and in medicine. However, this broad-leaved tree is facing multiple threats ranging from phytopathogens to insect pests. Here, a Gram-positive, endospore-forming bacterium (ZJU1) was frequently isolated from healthy mulberry plants by screening for foliar endophytes showing antagonism against pathogens and pests. Whole-genome sequencing and annotation resulted in a genome size of 4.06 Mb and classified the bacterium as a novel strain of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens that has rarely been identified from tree leaves. An integrative approach combining traditional natural product chemistry, activity bioassays, and high-resolution mass spectrometry confirmed that strain ZJU1 uses a blend of antimicrobials including peptides and volatile organic compounds to oppose Botrytis cinerea, a major phytopathogenic fungus causing mulberry gray mold disease. We showed that the inoculation of endophyte-free plants with ZJU1 significantly decreased both leaf necrosis and mortality under field conditions. In addition to the direct interactions of endophytes with foliar pathogens, in planta studies suggested that the inoculation of endophytes also induced plant systemic defense, including high expression levels of mulberry disease resistance genes. Moreover, when applied to the generalist herbivore Spodoptera litura, ZJU1 was sufficient to reduce the pest survival rate below 50%. A previously undiscovered crystal toxin (Cry10Aa) could contribute to this insecticidal effect against notorious lepidopteran pests. These unique traits clearly demonstrate that B. amyloliquefaciens ZJU1 is promising for the development of successful strategies for biocontrol applications.

16677,"Cattle grazing tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) often develop fescue toxicosis. This condition is thought to be caused by ergot alkaloids produced by the endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum. Endophytes from wild tall fescue plants, which do not produce ergot alkaloids, were transferred into the endophyte-free tall fescue germplasm, HiMag. The novel associations also lacked the ability to produce ergot alkaloids. Our objective was to determine whether cattle grazing these novel endophyte associations showed signs of fescue toxicosis. At the Fayetteville, Arkansas location, tester steers (n = 72) were assigned to one of four pasture treatments: endophyte-free HiMag tall fescue (HiMag-); 'Kentucky-31' tall fescue infected with its native, toxic endophyte (KY+); and two novel endophyte-infected tall fescue associations, HiMag4 and HiMag9. At the Mount Vernon, Missouri location, steers (n = 54) were used to test three of the four cultivars (HiMag9 was not tested). Ergot alkaloid concentrations in the forage of HiMag4 and HiMag9 were low or undetectable. Respiration rate, rectal temperature, ADG, and hair scores were measured during the grazing period.

Yet, the fungus can also modify plant resource allocation, regrowth dynamics, and drought tolerance, and these changes may also influence herbivores. We tested if N. coenophialum infection interacted with stress (drought or simulated herbivory) to modify plant resistance to insects. We assigned greenhouse plants to one of four treatments: 1) clipping at 3 cm above the soil surface, 2) drought stress during insect bioassays, 3) drought stress prior to insect bioassays, or 4) daily watering. Treatments were crossed with presence or absence of endophyte to give eight treatment combinations, and we assessed the performance of bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi) and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) feeding on plants in two separate experiments from each of the eight treatments. Aphids were placed into clip bags on leaf blades and allowed to reproduce parthenogenetically. Plant tissue was fed to third instar fall armyworm caterpillars until they molted into the fifth instar. Developmental time was recorded and larval growth was obtained gravimetrically. We also assessed total protein nitrogen (N) and loline alkaloids in plants. Total protein N was unaffected by endophyte infection. In contrast, stress influenced total protein N, but its effect varied with endophyte infection. Uninfected plants that were clipped had higher total protein N; this trend was absent in infected plants. Plants in drought stress had lower N, but only if they were infected. Lolines were nearly absent from uninfected plants. In infected plants they tended to be higher in clipped plants. The effect of endophyte infection differed between the two insects: aphid reproduction was reduced by the endophyte, but endophyte infection enhanced caterpillar performance. Both insects were affected by interactions between the endophyte and stress. Aphids were negatively affected by drought stress, but only when feeding on uninfected plants, while caterpillars showed the opposite response, displaying lower performance on drought stressed plants only if they were infected. Aphids reproduced faster on regrowth tissue (following damage by clipping) of uninfected plants, but endophyte infection cancelled this effect. In contrast, performance of caterpillars was not influenced by an interaction between damage and infection. We conclude that N. coenophialum does not provide universal resistance to insects.

Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV) vectored by Thrips tabaci Lindeman, is a major hindrance to onion production in eastern Africa. Control measures often rely on insecticides with deleterious effects. Endophytes are one key alternative as they can play important roles in mediating induced systemic resistance. Hence, we examined the potential effect of endophytic fungus Hypocrea lixii (F3ST1) on feeding and replication of IYSV on endophyte-colonized (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) onion plants. For more precise assessment, replication was also tested using leaf disk bioassays and individual thrips. The number of feeding punctures was significantly lower in E+ as compared to E- plants. Disease level was significantly lower in E+ as compared to E- plants for four weeks post-exposure to thrips. IYSV replication was reduced by 2.5-fold in endophytic treatment on both whole plant and leaf disk assays. Thrips tabaci showed 2 times higher feeding activities on endophyte-free onion leaf disks as compared to the endophyte-inoculated leaf disks.

Their artificial establishment as fungal endophytes to provide other benefits to the host plants aside mere protection against the primary pests has also been widely demonstrated. In the present study, two fungal strains of Beauveria bassiana and one strain of Isaria fumosorosea were assessed in a pathogenicity test against adults of Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri) and found to induce 50% reduction in the survival rate of D. citri adults within 5 days of exposure. The ability of the three fungal strains to endophytically colonize Citrus limon, the impact on plant growth and the effects of systemic colonization on 3 successive generations of D. citri feeding on colonized plants was evaluated. Citrus seedlings at 4 months post-planting were inoculated with each of the fungal strains via foliar spraying. Both strains of B. bassiana successfully colonized the seedlings. One of the B. bassiana strains (BB Fafu-13) was sustained up to 12 weeks in the colonized seedlings, whereas the other B. bassiana strain (BB Fafu-16) was only recovered up to 8 weeks post-inoculation. Isaria fumosorosea (IF Fafu-1) failed to colonize the plant. Both strains of B. bassiana induced significant improvement in plant height and flush production in endophytically colonized seedlings. In addition, endophytic B. bassiana caused 10-15% D. citri adult mortality within 7 days of exposure.

It was found that the germination rate, germination potential, germination index and vigor index of both E+ and E- drunken horse grass were decreased under the five different saline-alkali stresses. Germination was significantly inhibited with increase in saline-alkali stress concentration (P< 0.05). The radicle length and root-shoot ratio were also significantly decreased with increased salt concentration. Except for treatments C and E, physiological indexes (POD, SOD and CAT activities, MDA and proline levels in shoot tissue) of drunken horse grass were reduced at higher salt concentrations.

Measurements of pH, VFA, bacterial taxa, as well as the disappearance of neutral detergent fiber (aNDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and crude protein (CP) were taken after 48 h of incubation. aNDF disappearance values were significantly altered by seed type (P = 0.003) and isoflavone treatment (P = 0.005), and ADF disappearance values were significantly different in a seed × isoflavone treatment interaction (P ≤ 0.05). A seed × isoflavone treatment interaction was also observed with respect to CP disappearance (P ≤ 0.05). Eighteen bacterial taxa were significantly altered by seed × isoflavone treatment interaction groups (P ≤ 0.05), eight bacterial taxa were increased by isoflavones (P ≤ 0.05), and ten bacterial taxa were altered by seed type (P ≤ 0.05).

Choice and no-choice tests comparing feeding and early development of S. frugiperda larvae on endophyte-infected and endophyte-free leaf blade material were performed. Endophyte-mediated resistance to S. frugiperda was greatest in meadow fescue and weakest in tall fescue. Some endophyte isolates, particularly in perennial ryegrass and meadow fescue, had a major effect on feeding and development of S. frugiperda, whereas others had no effect or were only weakly efficacious. In tall fescue, some associations deterred S. frugiperda from feeding in choice tests but had no effect on development, whereas larvae reared on other associations weighed significantly more than control larvae fed endophyte-free grass.

1543,"Tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.)) is a cool-season perennial grass within which can live a fungal endophyte (Epichloe coenophiala) thought to provide enhanced edaphic and climactic stress tolerance to the host compared to non-infected individuals. Our prior research demonstrated that a variety of root exudate compounds released from tall fescue were differentially affected by tall fescue cultivar, endophyte genotype and their interaction. Changes in root exudates and associated microbial communities could influence soil processes, including carbon and nitrogen cycling, but these effects may differ depending on fescue and endophyte genetics. To test this, we collected rhizosphere and bulk soil samples from six year old field plots located in Lexington, KY planted with two different tall fescue cultivars (PDF and 97TF1), each containing four endophyte treatments [endophyte-free (E) or infected with one of three strains of E. coenophiala (common toxic, novel AR542E+ and novel AR584E+)]. The influence of fescue cultivar, endophyte strain, and soil sample location (rhizosphere vs. bulk) were assessed for soil organic carbon, soil organic nitrogen, particulate and non-particulate organic matter (POM and n-POM, respectively)- C and N, and dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (DOC, DON) pools. Soil functional aspects were evaluated by measuring soil respiration and the activity of seven different soil enzymes related to C, N and P cycling. We found that rhizosphere soils had greater microbial biomass, potential enzyme activity, and oxygen utilization, but lesser POM-N concentrations than bulk soils. In rhizosphere soils, tall fescue cultivar had the greatest influence on soil microbial community structure, while endophyte genotype had a stronger influence on soil C fractions (notably POM-C). Changes in root system architecture, biomass,, and tissue composition, together with root exudate chemistry, which we have shown in previous studies to be affected by endophyte infection and fescue cultivar, likely explain these findings. There was greater POM-N in bulk soils which was influenced by the interaction of endophyte and cultivar potentially due to differences in the chemical composition of the tissues brought about by this interaction. Our results support current observations that tall fescue cultivar and fungal endophyte strain influence soil C and N cycling and, by analyzing bulk and rhizosphere soils separately, go further to show the level of influence cultivar and endophyte have within each of these compartments.

To do so, mandarin (Citrus reticulata) scions grafted on Bakraii [Citrus reticulata x Citrus limetta] (Mandarin/Bakraii) were subjected to four irrigations interval including 2, 4, 6 and 8 days, in present/absent of the fungal endophytes. The results indicated that drought stress significantly reduced growth, chlorophyll, carotenoid content and chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) of the plants lacking endophytes. Combinatory applications with three fungal endophytes (P. citrinum + A. pullunts + Dothideomycetes sp.) significantly improved the above-mentioned parameters under drought stress.

Yet a number of mechanisms have been identified in grasses, which may deter feeding by grazers. These include enhanced silicon uptake, hosting of toxin-producing endophytic fungi and induction of secondary metabolites. While these mechanisms have been individually studied, their synergistic responses to grazing, as well as their effects on grazers, are poorly known. A field experiment was carried out in 5 x 5 m outdoor enclosures to quantify phytochemical changes of either endophyte-infected (E+) or endophyte-free (E-) meadow fescue (Schedonorus pratensis) in response to medium intensity (corresponding with densities of ca. 1200 voles/ha for 5 weeks during 3 months) or heavy intensity (ca. 1200 voles/ha for 8 weeks during 3 months) grazing by a mammalian herbivore, the field vole (Microtus agrestis). A laboratory experiment was then conducted to evaluate the effects of endophyte infection status and grazing history of the grass diet on vole performance. As predicted, grazing increased foliar silicon content, by up to 13%. Grazing also increased foliar levels of phosphorous and several phenolic compounds, most notably those of the flavonols isorhamnetin-diglycoside and rhamnetin derivative. Silicon concentrations were consistently circa 16% higher in E+ grasses than in E-grasses, at all levels of grazing. Similarly, concentrations of chlorogenic acid derivative were found to be consistently higher in E+ than in E grasses.

We studied the consequences of a grass fungus symbiosis on the trade-off between seed number and weight, using Lolium multiflorum and the endophyte Neotyphodium occultans as our study system. In ecological terms, we experimentally removed N. occultans from L. multiflorum plants, and compared reproductive allocation to seed number and weight in endophyte-symbiotic vs. non-symbiotic plants at different levels of nutrient availability (small pots vs. large pots). In evolutionary terms, we compared reproductive allocation between symbiotic vs. non-symbiotic plants for different host genotypes. All plants showed a negative association between seed number and weight, once standardized for total reproductive biomass. Under high nutrient availability, endophyte-symbiotic plants showed higher seed weight than non-symbiotic plants for any seed number.

Sheep are normally resistant to PA-induced hepatotoxicity. Twenty-four wether lambs weighing 34.1±2.3 kg were used after being randomly assigned to 1 of 6 treatments of 4 wethers each.

14014,"Tall fescue is usually infected by a fungal endophyte, responsible of livestock intoxication due to fungal alkaloids. An endophyte fungus grows in the apoplast of aboveground tissues and is vertically transmitted through the seeds. Disinfecting plants or clones not only is useful as a way of eliminating a dangerous microorganism from cultivars, but also for experimental purposes. However, not all fungicides are effective, and if they are, a waiting period must be respected in order to avoid confounding effects of the endophyte and the treatment. We subjected plants (ramets from four genotypes) to different doses of two fungicides, Almagor® (Triazole + Imidazole) and Amistar® (Methoxy-acrylate), and evaluated the endophyte persistence. Fungicides were pipette-poured on pseudostems’ bases of each plant. Endophytic status was diagnosed in tillers that received the fungicide and in the new tillers produced by the plants and seeds. While Amistar® had no detectable effect, Almagor® was 100% effective at all doses. The latter interrupted the vertical-transmission processes (5400 evaluated seeds were endophyte-free). Phytotoxic effects were not observed in seeds. Proportion of normal and abnormal seedlings depended only on plant genotype.

15889,"Schedonorus arundinaceus (tall fescue) population can be infected by the endophyte fungus Epichloë coenophiala, responsible of livestock intoxication due to fungal alkaloids (i.e., ergovaline). The effects of ergovaline in pastures can be aenuated through dilution; this is, to interseed infected tall fescue (E+) with legumes, endophyte-free grass, or with both. Plant interaction and ergovaline concentration in mixture of tall fescue (E+) and Lotus tenuis, a forage legume, were investigated in replacement series experiments under defoliation conditions. The interaction between species was analysed through relative yield total (RYT) of the forage biomass, aggressivity index (AI), plant cover and ergovaline concentration. The work was performed in field conditions. Six cuttings were applied during the experimental period. Plant monocultures of each species were at a constant density of 80 pl/m2, while mixtures ratios were 20:60, 40:40 and 60:20 pl/m2 of L. tenuis and tall fescue, respectively. Mortality of L. tenuis and tall fescue plants was not observed. Tall fescues yield and plant cover, in monoculture and in mixture, were higher than in L. tenuis. RYT was higher than 1 for all mixtures. According to AI, in mixture, tall fescue was the dominant species and overcompensated the lower yield of L. tenuis. At the early Autumn, ergovaline concentration in monoculture was 1.637±0.594 ng/g, and in the 40:40 mixture was 0.407±0.109 ng/g. Forage production was higher in mixtures than in monocultures, and L. tenuis contributed to reduce ergovaline concentration. According to the results, 40:40 pl/m2 of tall fescue and L. tenuis was the best species combination. A positive effect of L. tenuis on growth of tall fescue mediated by nitrogen availability could have allowed the plant coexistence.

Results and discussionThe results showed that endophyte infection significantly increased the belowground biomass and abundance of Cleistogenes squarrosa, marginally significantly increased the abundance of Stipa grandis and significantly increased the community diversity (evenness) of the 4-species mixtures. Endophyte infection also significantly increased the over-yielding effects on belowground biomass of the 4-species mixtures in the live soil, and the increase in diversity effects on belowground biomass was mainly due to the endophyte significantly increasing the complementary effects on belowground biomass. The effects of soil microorganisms on the diversity effects on belowground biomass of the 4-species mixtures were mainly derived from their influences on the complementary effects. The effects of endophytes and soil microorganisms on the diversity effects on belowground biomass of the 4-species communities were independent, and both contributed similarly to the complementary effects on belowground biomass. The finding that endophyte infection promotes belowground over-yielding in live soil at higher levels of species diversity suggests that endophytes may be one of the factors contributing to the positive relationship between species diversity and productivity and explains the stable co-existence of endophyte-infected Achnatherum sibiricum with a variety of plants in the Inner Mongolian grasslands.",2023,Presence,Presence,3,3,Medium,endophyte-free,ITS; investigated,"constructing artificial communities with 1-species monocultures and 2- and 4-species mixtures of endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) Achnatherum sibiricum and three common plants in its native habitat, which were potted in","4-species mixtures of endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) Achnatherum sibiricum and three common plants in its native habitat, which were potted in live and sterilized soil.

15440,"Background: Invasive plants may displace native species. This is the case for Poa annua, the only non-native plant species successfully established in Maritime Antarctica. Nonetheless, it is uncertain which factors drive the competitive success of P. annua in the harsh environmental conditions of the region. The ability of this plant species to establish novel mutualistic interactions with resident soil fungi may be crucial for its invasiveness. Such ability may be linked to the vertical transmission of fungal endophytes via seeds. Aims: We undertook a study to assess the role of seed fungal endophytes as promoters of the establishment and invasion of Poa annua in Maritime Antarctica. Methods: We explored the composition and diversity of fungal communities associated with different P. annua tissues (seeds, leaves and roots) and the soil. We also measured parameters including germination rate, above-ground biomass, reproductive structures, and the survival of invasive P. annua as well as of the native Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica grown from seeds with and without endophytes. Furthermore, we conducted inter- and intraspecific competition experiments among native and invasive plants, where chemically mediated plant-to-plant interference (allelopathy) and plant growth rate were measured to calculate a relative competition index. Results: We found that fungal endophyte taxa associated with P. annua tissues were very different from those in the soil. Fungal endophytes in P. annua differed among seed, root and shoot tissues, which suggests low transmission among different organs. The removal of endophytes from P. annua seeds was associated with reduced seed germination, plant growth and survivorship, while the competitive ability of P. annua (assessed by accumulated biomass) relative to native species, as well as levels of allelochemicals in soils, were higher in the presence of seed fungal endophytes.

21042,"Tall fescue, Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.) Dumort, is one of the most sown perennial temperate grasses in Argentina, both in pure and mix pastures. The main agronomic qualities of this species are its high productivity, rusticity, plasticity and perennity. Tall fescue plants are usually infected by an asexual endophytic fungus, Epichloë coenophiala, which is asymptomatic and only the fungus propagates via infected seeds (vertical transmission). Although the fungus confers adaptive advantages to host plants, it can also synthesize toxic metabolites for grazing cattle. These metabolites cause severe health problems and significant losses in livestock production. In this review, it is described the grass species, the endophyte fungus, the interaction between them, and the harmful effects on domestic herbivores by consuming infected tall fescue plants of infected tall fescue in endophyte-free pastures are analyzed and some of the management strategies used to mitigate the negative effects of the endophyte on livestock production systems are indicated.

However, we previously showed that prepartum consumption of infected seed throughout the dry period did not inhibit subsequent milk production and prior exposure to bromocriptine (ergot peptide) actually increased production in the next lactation. To identify changes in the transcriptome and molecular pathways mediating the mammary gland's response to ergot alkaloids in the diet, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on mammary tissues obtained from 22 multiparous Holstein cows exposed to 1 of 3 treatments. Starting at 90 ± 4 d prepartum, cows were fed endophyte-free fescue seed (control; CON), endophyte-free fescue seed plus 3×/wk subcutaneous injections of bromocriptine (BROMO; 0.1 mg/kg of BW), or endophyte-infected fescue seed (INF) as 10% of the diet. Cows were dried off 60 ± 2 d prepartum. Mammary biopsies from 4 (BROMO, INF) or 5 (CON) cows/treatment at each of the 3 phases were obtained: 7 d before dry off during the initial lactation (L1), mid-dry period (D), and 10 d postpartum (L2). Although tissue from the same cow was preferentially used at 3 phases (L1, D, L2), tissue from additional cows were used to as necessary to provide RNA of sufficient quality. Individual samples were used to generate individual RNA-seq libraries. Normalized reads of the RNA-seq data were organized into technical and biological replicates before processing with the RSEM software package.

A large proportion of genes differentially expressed in at least 1 treatment (n = 866) were found to be similarly expressed in BROMO and INF treatments, but differentially expressed from CON (n = 575, total for 3 phases). Of genes differentially expressed compared with CON, 104 genes were common to the L1 and L2 phases. Consistent with the production findings, networks most affected by treatments in L1 and L2 included lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, and molecular transport, whereas networks related more to developmental and cellular functions and maintenance were evident during D phase.

Although endophyte infections were widespread in native grass species, overall endophyte occurrence and frequencies were lower than published reports have suggested. In natural populations, 10 out of 14 grass species examined harbor fungal endophytes in their seeds. The highest species-specific mean incidences of endophyte infected plants in infected populations were found in Agrostis capillaris, Festuca arundinacea, F. ovina, F. pratensis, F. rubra and Phleum pratense (67%, 98%, 29%, 42%, 32% and 33%, respectively).

However, we detected a very high variation in infection incidences among natural populations and a large proportion of populations was, indeed, endophyte-free. This supports the ideas that 1) endophytic fungi provide selective advantage of infected grasses to their uninfected conspecifics in some habitats, and/or 2) fungi are occasionally transmitted horizontally by spores. In grass cultivars, endophyte infected seeds were detected only in F. pratensis and Lolium perenne, and endophyte frequencies were either very high or very low.

19515,"Epichloë endophytes in grass associations express a myriad of secondary metabolites which can affect the health of grazing animals and reduce the impact of insect pests on pasture. The ideal endophyte-grass association must have a favourable chemical profile such that the impact on animal health is minimised while the beneficial, deterrent effect on insect pests is maximised. A number of endophyte-perennial ryegrass associations have been successfully commercialised but research is on-going to further improve production in farming systems. Secondary metabolites expressed by endophyte-infected tall fescue include lolines, an animal-safe class of compound which imparts a potent effect on insects. Since endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass does not express lolines, a tall fescue endophyte, AR501, was inoculated into perennial ryegrass in an attempt to improve the insect resistance of this pasture type. In addition to animal safety, it is imperative that consideration is given to the safety of humans consuming animal products derived from livestock grazing the novel pasture. Although pure loline alkaloids have previously been tested on mice it is essential that the entire AR501 endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass matrix is tested since this will result in the exposure of both known and unknown secondary metabolites to mice. Three treatment groups each containing 6 male and 6 female mice were fed diets containing AR501 endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass seed (30%), perennial ryegrass seed containing no endophyte (30%) or a diet without seed (control) for 3 weeks. Mice fed control diet ate more than either of the treatment groups fed a diet containing seed. Male mice fed diet containing Nil endophyte seed ate more than those eating AR501 endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass seed although there was no difference observed in the food intake of female mice. While a few statistically significant differences were observed in the haematology and serum biochemical data, in every instance the difference was restricted to only one gender so is considered unlikely to be of toxicological significance.

12168,"1. Endophytic fungi in agricultural grasses confer agronomic advantages but can be detrimental to the health and production of grazing mammals. Attempts have been made to resolve this dilemma by creating novel associations of high-yielding grass cultivars and 'safe endophytes' that do not naturally co-occur. Recently, researchers created a novel association by combining a Moroccan strain of Neotyphodium coenophialum, called AR542, with the tall fescue Festuca arundinacea cultivar Georgia 5. This novel association is marketed commercially and has no doubt become naturalized; it is therefore important to assess its impact on other organisms. 2. The bird-cherry-oat aphid Rhopalosiphum padi uses tall fescue as an alternative host. We assessed the performance of R. padi feeding on Georgia 5 that had been artificially infected with AR542, naturally infected by the common strain (CS) of N. coenophialum or was endophyte-free (EF). We cross-factored these three levels of endophyte infection with four levels of nitrogen fertilizer, and used two different methods of assessing aphid performance, clip-cages and enclosed populations. 3. Endophyte-infected plants produced approximately 20% more dry mass than EF plants. In both the clip-cage and enclosed-population experiments, aphid populations grew fastest on the EF plants, slower on AR542-infected plants and slowest (or not at all) on the CS-infected plants. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that AR542 infection does not provide the same degree of protection from aphids as the commonly occurring CS infection. If similar results are found for other invertebrate herbivores, then the use of this novel endophyte association may be less useful than previously thought. The widespread conversion of tall fescue pastures, currently infected with the CS endophyte, to pastures infected with AR542 could result in a general increase in the prevalence of cereal aphids and, potentially, the diseases that they spread.

19198,"In plant-herbivore interactions, plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play an important role in anti-herbivore defense. Grasses and Epichloë endophytes often form defensive mutualistic symbioses. Most Epichloë species produce alkaloids to protect hosts from herbivores, but there is no strong evidence that endophytes can affect the insect resistance of their hosts by altering VOC emissions. In this study, a native dominant grass, sheepgrass (Leymus chinensis), and its herbivore, oriental migratory locust (Locusta migratoria), were used as experimental materials. We studied the effect of endophyte-associated VOC emissions on the insect resistance of L. chinensis. The results showed that endophyte infection enhanced insect resistance of the host, and locusts preferred the odor of endophyte-free (EF) leaves to that of endophyte-infected (EI) leaves. We determined the VOC profile of L. chinensis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and found that endophyte infection decreased the pentadecane (an alkane) emission from uneaten plants, and increased the nonanal (an aldehyde) emission from eaten plants. The olfactory response experiment showed that locusts were attracted by high concentration of pentadecane, while repelled by high concentration of nonanal, indicating that Epichloë endophytes may increase locust resistance of L. chinensis by decreasing pentadecane while increasing nonanal emission.

1153,"The increasing expenses and environmental repercussions associated with phosphorus (P) fertiliser underscore the necessity for precision-managed application methods. These changes affect pastoral systems, where cool-season grasses like perennial ryegrass and meadow fescue form beneficial relationships with Epichlo & euml; endophytes. Understanding how fertilisers influence these endophytes, host grasses, and insect pests is crucial, as Epichlo & euml; endophytes enhance resistance to some herbivorous insects. This study examined the indirect impact of various P fertiliser regimes on cool-season grasses, which serve as food sources for porina larvae (Wiseana copularis), a significant pasture pest in New Zealand. Endophyte-infected (Epichlo & euml; sp.

Freeze-dried foliage was added to semi-synthetic diets and fed to porina larvae in a no-choice assay. Measurements included diet consumption, porina survival, weight gain. Measurements in foliage included fungal alkaloid concentration, fungal biomass, and plant nutrient levels. Endophyte infection of AR37 and MaxR significantly reduced porina diet consumption, larval weight gain and survival irrespective of soil Olsen P levels to the plant. Loline alkaloid concentration in MaxR-infected herbage increased with increasing soil Olsen P levels while fungal mass remained unchanged. In endophyte-free grasses, porina larvae significantly increased their diet consumption, weight gain and survival as the Olsen P level available to the host plant increased. While endophyte strains AR37 and MaxR continue to protect their hosts under different Olsen P regimes, these results suggest that the improved performance of porina on endophyte-free plants is largely driven by P-induced changes in food quality.

14436,"Simultaneous infections of host plants with endophytic fungi are common in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Endophyte-infected (E+) grasses may differ in chemical composition and root exudates from endophyte-free (E-) individuals, and these differences may indirectly affect soil properties and microbial communities in the host grass habitat. In this study, we used as plant material Achnatherum sibiricum, a native grass, naturally infected with two species of endophytes, including Epichloë sibirica and E. gansuensis. E. gansuensis has two morphotypes, E. gansuensis-1 and E. gansuensis-2,of which E. gansuensis-1 exhibits strict vertical transmission, while E. gansuensis-2 can be transmitted vertically as well as horizontally. The objective of this study was to explore the effect of endophyte infection, endophyte species, nitrogen availability, and maternal plant genotype on the physicochemical properties and microbial communities of soil in the A. sibiricum habitat. At the end of a pot experiment, we analyzed the soil total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), determined soil pH, and estimated the soil C mineralization. Soil microbial biomass and community composition were assayed by using the phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) technique. In the present study, we found that the soil pH value differed significantly between the E+ and E- treatments (E+ > E-). In addition, the soil pH was influenced by endophyte species: pH in the E. sibirica-infected condition was higher than that in the E. gansuense-1 infected condition, but the difference was not significant with the E. gansuense-2 condition. Endophyte infection significantly improved the total amount of rhizosphere microorganisms but reduced soil bacterial:fungal ratio. Endophyte status and species, nitrogen addition, and maternal plant genotype had no significant effects on soil total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), rhizosphere microorganisms and C mineralization ability.

To assess the relative importance of endophytic fungi compared to that of natural enemies on the population dynamics of phytophagous insects, we carried out a fully factorial field experiment, in which the presence of natural enemies and the presence of endophytic fungi were manipulated simultaneously. Target colonies of aphids were monitored for 8 weeks starting from their natural appearance in the field to the end of the aphid season.

However, seed predation was lower in E+ than E grasses in the two tall fescue populations with higher predation rates. For meadow fescue, the mean number of seeds from E+ plants was higher than E plants, but E and E+ seeds had equal rates of predation by the moth.

10774,"Tall fescue [Schenodorus phoenix (Scop.) Holub.] has historically been of minor importance to livestock agriculture in cooler regions of the temperate zone. As its use in these regions expands, it becomes increasingly important to understand the effect of infection by its fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum Morgan-Jones and Gams) on agronomic fitness of tall fescue. Our objective was to determine the effect of endophyte infection status on forage yield and survival of tall fescue under field conditions in which freezing temperatures, combined with lack of persistent snow cover, constitute the most significant stress factor. In Experiment 1, we evaluated 427 half-sib families of four tall fescue cultivars, half endophyte-infected (E+) and half endophyte-free (E-), for forage yield and survival. There was no effect of endophyte removal on either forage yield or survival, despite complete stand loss of one cultivar during two winters. In Experiment 2, we evaluated 640 clones of confirmed endophyte status, half E+ and half E-, for survival under two management regimes at four Wisconsin locations. Results were nearly identical to those for Experiment 1, with complete mortality in the unadapted cultivar and high survival rates in the three adapted cultivars, regardless of endophyte status, management, or location. In conclusion, we found no evidence that endophyte removal resulted in any disadvantage to tall fescue host-plant survival under harsh winter conditions.

1256,"Variation in plant communities is likely to modulate the feeding and oviposition behavior of herbivorous insects, and plant-associated microbes are largely ignored in this context. Here, we take into account that insects feeding on grasses commonly encounter systemic and vertically transmitted (via seeds) fungal Epichloe endophytes, which are regarded as defensive grass mutualists. Defensive mutualism is primarily attributable to alkaloids of fungal origin. To study the effects of Epichloe on insect behavior and performance, we selected wild tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) and red fescue (Festuca rubra) as grass-endophyte models. The plants used either harbored the systemic endophyte (E+) or were endophyte-free (E-). As a model herbivore, we selected the Coenonympha hero butterfly feeding on grasses as larvae. We examined both oviposition and feeding preferences of the herbivore as well as larval performance in relation to the presence of Epichloe endophytes in the plants. Our findings did not clearly support the female's oviposition preference to reflect the performance of her offspring. First, the preference responses depended greatly on the grass-endophyte symbiotum. In F. arundinacea, C. hero females preferred E+ individuals in oviposition-choice tests, whereas in F. rubra, the endophytes may decrease exploitation, as both C. hero adults and larvae preferred E- grasses. Second, the endophytes had no effect on larval performance. Overall, F. arundinacea was an inferior host for C. hero larvae. However, the attraction of C. hero females to E+ may not be maladaptive if these plants constitute a favorable oviposition substrate for reasons other than the plants' nutritional quality. For example, rougher surface of E+ plant may physically facilitate the attachment of eggs, or the plants offer greater protection from natural enemies.

We examined the infection frequency of Epichloe festucae in populations of two fine fescue species (Festuca rubra and F. ovina) in natural and seminatural habitats at 86 study sites (total = 2514 plants) across Finland and northern Norway. Infection incidence varied significantly among grass species and populations. A substantial number of the F. rubra and F. ovina populations (53 out of 77 and 25 out of 30, respectively) were either endophyte-free or had very low (< 20%) infection frequencies. The highest infection frequencies were found in subarctic areas. Moreover, infection incidence differed between habitats. In the area with the highest infection frequencies, we used microsatellite markers to study genetic diversity and the rates of gene flow of E. festucae among 12 F. rubra populations. Twenty out of the 25 fungal genotypes detected with four microsatellite markers were carrying multiple alleles in at least one locus, indicating multiple infections or vegetative hybridization of the fungus. One dominant genotype occurred in all 12 populations, representing 63.5% of all isolates. We found a moderate level of average genotypic variation and a low level of genetic differentiation (F-st = 0.0814). There was no correlation between infection frequency and genotypic diversity. Although the existence of a dominant genotype and the detected linkage disequilibrium suggest that the fungus is mainly asexual and vertically transmitted, the multiallelic loci and variation of genetic diversity among populations indicate occasional contagious spread and sexual or parasexual recombination of the fungus in some populations.

The results revealed high variability in endophyte effects on the investigated parameters. In seven genotypes, endophyte presence improved plant growth and seed production during the first harvest year. However, in four of these genotypes, endophyte effects were reversed in the following harvests. In the remaining six genotypes, endophyte infection reduced plant performance. The impact of the fungus on TSW was inconsistent, while seed germination was either improved or not affected by the endophyte. A positive endophyte effect was detectable for genotypes with low performance of EF clones, whereas genotypes with high-yield EF clones were not, or negatively, affected by the endophyte. Genotypes originating from sites exposed to flooding and periodic drought showed consistent negative endophyte effects on herbage yield and seed production.

However, few studies have tested whether such interactions can affect species distributions by altering the niches of partner species. In subalpine meadows of the Rocky Mountains, USA, we explored whether the presence of a fungal endophyte (genus Epichloe) may shift the niche of its partner plant, marsh bluegrass (Poa leptocoma) relative to a closely related but endophyte-free grass species, nodding bluegrass (Poa reflexa). Using observations and a 3-year field experiment, we tested two questions: (i) Do P. leptocoma and P. reflexa occupy different ecological niches? and (ii) Does endophyte presence affect the relative fitness of P. leptocoma versus P. reflexa in the putative niches of these grass species? The two species were less likely to co-occur than expected by chance. Specifically, P. leptocoma grew closer to water sources and in wetter soils than P. reflexa, and also had higher root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi. Endophyte-symbiotic P. leptocoma seeds germinated with greater frequency in P. leptocoma niches relative to P. reflexa niches, whereas neither endophyte-free (experimentally removed) P. leptocoma seeds nor P. reflexa seeds showed differential germination between the two niche types. Thus, endophyte presence constrained the germination and early survival of host plants to microsites occupied by P. leptocoma. However, endophyte-symbiotic P. leptocoma ultimately showed greater growth than endophyte-free plants across all microsites, indicating a net benefit of the symbiosis at this life history stage. Differential effects of endophyte symbiosis on different host life history stages may thus contribute to niche partitioning between the two congeneric plant species.

Feeding by root aphids such as Aploneura lentisci Pass. can be a significant challenge to pastures. These below-ground living aphids are commonly found in New Zealand and Australia, feeding year-round on the roots of graminaceous plants such as perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Some strains of the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae var. lolii in perennial ryegrass can provide protection against root aphids and greater resilience under drought, contributing to higher persistency and growth than endophyte-free plants. However, the interaction between insect pressure and drought is not understood. This study examined the effect of drought on root aphid populations and plant performance in perennial ryegrass plants relative to endophyte status (+/-) and endophyte strain (AR37, NZ(CT)) in a glasshouse experiment. Plants were cloned across the drought and well-watered treatments, and half of the plants were inoculated with root aphids, whilst half of the plants were treated with insecticide. Endophyte infection with strain NZ(CT) and AR37 reduced root aphid numbers. Aphid populations were significantly higher in drought-stressed than in well-watered plants in both endophyte-infected and endophyte-free treatments. Under drought conditions, root aphid populations were increased 4-fold in NZ(CT) and 8-fold in AR37 and endophyte-free plants in comparison with their well-watered counterparts. Root aphids reduced shoot dry weight by 16% in drought-exposed and 26% in well-watered plants in comparison with their insecticide-treated counterparts whilst reducing root biomass by 49%. Our results suggest that root aphids are likely able to exploit the higher availability of amino acids in the plant sap of drought-exposed plants.

16879,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of growing cattle when intensively grazing stockpiled endophyte-infected (E+), endophyte-free (E-), and nontoxic endophyte-infected (EN) tall fescue during the winter. The experiment was conducted over 5 consecutive winters. In each year, plots (1 ha each, 4 per treatment) were harvested for hay in August, fertilized in September, and forage was allowed to accumulate until grazing was initiated in early December. Each year, 48 Angus-cross tester cattle (4 per plot) were given a daily allotment of forage, under strip-grazing (frontal grazing) management, with a target residual height of 5 cm. Steers were used the first year, and heifers were used in subsequent years. The grazing periods for determination of pasture ADG were 86 d (yr 1), 70 d (yr 2), 86 d (yr 3), 72 d (yr 4), and 56 d (yr 5). Pasture ADG of cattle did not differ among treatments (P = 0.13) and were 0.51, 0.59, and 0.56 kg/d (SEM 0.03) for E+, E-, and EN, respectively. Serum prolactin concentrations of heifers grazing E+ were less (P < 0.05) than those grazing E- and EN during all years except yr 2. In yr 2, E+ and E- did not differ (P = 0.11). Serum prolactin of heifers grazing E- and EN did not differ (P > 0.20) except in yr 4. During yr 4, serum prolactin of heifers grazing E- was greater (P = 0.05) than that of heifers grazing EN. Serum urea-N concentrations (SUN) tended to differ among treatments (P = 0.10) and there was a treatment x year interaction (P = 0.05). During yr 1 through 3, SUN did not differ (P > 0.15) among treatments. However, as the stands aged, E- had a greater invasion of other plant species, which increased the CP content of the sward, thus causing heifers grazing E- during yr 5 to have greater (P < 0.01) SUN than heifers grazing E+ and EN, which did not differ (P = 0.89). Forage disappearance (DM basis) did not differ (P = 0.75) among treatments and was 4.7, 4.7, and 5.0 kg/animal daily (SEM 0.27) for E+, E-, and EN, respectively.

20573,"Acremonium coenophialum Morgan-Jones and Gams, an: endophytic fungus commonly found in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), has been identified as the cause of poor performance of beef cattle and horses on tall fescue. Ryegrass staggers, a neurological disorder of sheep, has been linked to the presence of a similar fungus, A. lolii Latch, Christensen and Samuels, in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Renovation of endophyte-infected (E+) pastures with endophyte-free (E-) cultivars of tall fescue or perennial ryegrass has resulted in improved animal performance, but productivity and stand persistence of tl-ie grasses have been reduced. Stand loss of E- tall fescue has been attributed to a number of stresses, including insect attack, disease, root predation by nematodes, and drought stress. The Acremonium endophyte has been observed to stimulate the tall fescue plant's production of chitinase, an enzyme associated with disease resistance. Nematode resistance, which can also be enhanced in Ec plants, has been attributed, in part, to thickening of the root endodermal layer. Drought stress has been identified as the most common cause of E- tall fescue stand loss in the eastern United States. Endophyte-infected tall fescue plants exhibit several adaptive morphological and physiological responses to drought stress compared with E- plants. Drought-induced leaf rolling, leaf senescence, stomatal closure, and osmotic adjustment are more prevalent in E+ than in E- plants and may be mediated through endophyte enhancement Of the production of phytohormones such as abscisic acid. Endophyte-infected tall fescue plants have been shown to be more productive and competitive than E- plants through improvement of germination, tillering, and biomass production per tiller. The increase in tiller production associated with endophyte infection may be due to fungal secretion of indoleacetic acid. The presence of Acremonium endophytes enhances a number of physiological responses that sensitize host plants to abiotic and biotic stresses, resulting in improved plant persistence.

4331,"AIM: To investigate whether Mediterranean tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh. (syn Festuca arundinacea)) infected with selected fungal endophytes (Epichloe coenophiala (formerly Neotyphodium coenophialum)) caused equine fescue oedema when grown in New Zealand, and to examine the pathological changes associated with this intoxication.METHODS: Horses were grazed on Mediterranean tall fescue that was infected with the endophytes AR542 (n=2), or AR584 (n=3), or Mediterranean tall fescue that was endophyte-free (n=2). Blood samples were taken up to 7 days after the start of feeding to detect changes in concentrations of total protein in serum and packed cell volume. Any horse showing clinical evidence of disease was subject to euthanasia and necropsy.RESULTS: Within 6 days, both horses grazing fescue infected with AR542 became depressed and lethargic. One horse grazing fescue infected with endophyte AR584 became depressed within a 5-day feeding period while another horse in this group died shortly after being removed from the AR584 pasture. The third horse in this group did not develop clinical signs within the 5-day feeding period. However, haemoconcentration and hypoproteinaemia was detected in all horses grazing Mediterranean tall fescue that was infected by AR542 or AR584 endophyte. No abnormalities were observed in horses grazing fescue that was endophyte-free. Necropsy examination was performed on two horses grazing fescue infected with AR542 and one horse grazing fescue infected with AR584. All three horses had marked oedema of the gastrointestinal tract. Histologically, the oedema was accompanied by large numbers of eosinophils, but no necrosis.CONCLUSIONS: Horses grazing Mediterranean tall fescue that was infected by AR542 or AR584 developed hypoproteinaemia and haemoconcentration, most likely due to leakage of plasma proteins into the gastrointestinal tract. This suggests that these selected endophytes produce a compound that is toxic to horses, although the toxic principle is currently unknown.CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Mediterranean tall fescue that is infected by AR542 or AR584 should not be fed to horses in New Zealand.

1826,"Epichloe endophytes can improve the resistance of host grasses to pathogenic fungi, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we used phytohormone quantifications, gene expression analysis, and pathogenicity experiments to investigate the effect of Epichloe sibirica on the resistance of Achnatherum sibiricum to Curvularia lunata pathogens. Comparison of gene expression patterns between endophyte-infected and endophyte-free leaves revealed that endophyte infection was associated with significant induction of 1,758 and 765 differentially expressed genes in the host before and after pathogen inoculation, respectively. Functional analysis of the differentially expressed genes suggested that endophyte infection could activate the constitutive resistance of the host by increasing photosynthesis, enhancing the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species, and actively regulating the expression of genes with function related to disease resistance. We found that endophyte infection was associated with induction of the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis pathways of jasmonic acid, ethylene, and pipecolic acid and amplified the defense response of the jasmonic acid/ethylene co-regulated EIN/ERF1 transduction pathway and Pip-mediated TGA transduction pathway. Phytohormone quantifications showed that endophyte infection was associated with significant accumulation of jasmonic acid, ethylene, and pipecolic acid after pathogen inoculation. Exogenous phytohormone treatments confirmed that the disease index of plants was negatively related to both jasmonic acid and ethylene concentrations.

The primary objective of the present study was to determine whether those same lines also differed in hepatic Phase I enzyme activity, estimated from sleep time (ST) following sodium pentobarbital anesthesia. Additional objectives were to determine whether ST differences between lines were modulated by endophyte-infected fescue in the diet (with or without an enzyme inducer) and whether ST of individual mice was correlated with the effect of a toxin-containing diet on the postweaning growth of those mice. In Exp. I, 24 males from each line were randomly assigned to each of five diets: control (commercial rodent food meal); E+ (50% endophyte-infected fescue seed, 50% control); E+P (the E+ diet supplemented with 1,000 ppm phenobarbital); E- (50% endophyte-free fescue seed, 50% control); and E-P (the E- diet supplemented with 1,000 ppm phenobarbital).

Growth response to the E+ diet was the percentage of reduction in gain on the E+ diet compared to gain on the E- diet the previous 2 wk. As in Exp. I, S mice slept longer than R mice (P < 0.01). The residual correlation between ST and gain reduction associated with the E+ diet equaled 0.04.

Tall fescue is grown on more than 35 million acres (14.2 million ha) of pasture in the United States, and three-fourths of the pastures are infected with the endophyte at a 60% or greater level. Tall fescue toxicosis caused by endophyte-produced ergot alkaloids continues to be the most important grass-related disease in the United States, in terms of economic loss to animal producers. However, the agronomic attributes of tall fescue make it an attractive forage species because of its ability to withstand cool temperatures, drought, poor soil conditions, and intensive defoliation from herbivore species, including insects. Tall fescue toxicosis is a complex disease and the need exists to understand the mechanisms of the toxic effects in order to institute effective, prophylactic control measures. Our group previously reported changes that occur in serum biochemical analytes of cattle that graze endophyte-infected tall fescue. An additional year's worth of data have been added, strengthening and corroborating these data. Consistent and significant changes associated with tall fescue toxicosis during the 3-yr study included decreased serum concentrations of cholesterol, globulin (increased albumin/globulin ratio), prolactin, total protein, and copper.

The physiological characteristics of E+ and E- genotypes of L. perenne indicated a better resistance of E + genotypes under drought stress in terms of higher biomass and relative water content, deeper root system, and greater osmolytes accumulation and antioxidant potential. It is concluded that the osmotic adjustment (higher content of proline and total carbohydrate), lower oxidative biomarkers (H2O2 and MDA content), higher enzymatic and nonenzymatic components (phenolic, GSH), and induction of stress hormone (Abscisic acid (ABA)) are key protective mechanisms in E + genotypes under drought stress.

Theory predicts that a balance of fitness benefits and efficiency of vertical transmission may interact to stabilize intermediate prevalence. We established populations of grass hosts (Lolium multiflorum) that varied in prevalence of a heritable fungal endophyte (Epichloe occultans), allowing us to infer long-term equilibria by tracking change in prevalence over one generation. We manipulated an environmental stressor (elevated precipitation), which we hypothesized would reduce the fitness benefits of symbiosis, and altered the efficiency of vertical transmission by replacing endophyte-positive seeds with endophyte-free seeds. Endophytes and elevated precipitation both increased host fitness, but symbiont effects were not stronger in the drier treatment, suggesting that benefits of symbiosis were unrelated to drought tolerance. Reduced transmission suppressed the inferred equilibrium prevalence from 42.6% to 11.7%. However, elevated precipitation did not modify prevalence, consistent with the result that it did not modify fitness benefits.

These symbionts are known to improve the performance of their host grasses in some situations of biotic and abiotic stress, leading to the suggestion that they can be used to improve grass tolerance to contaminants. The grass Festuca rubra is a host of the endophyte Epichloe festucae. We used two half-sib lines of F. rubra, each line composed of infected (E+) or endophyte-free (E-) seeds, to study the effect of varying levels of arsenic (6, 12, 25, and 50 mg L-1), and of the endophyte in seed germination and radicle growth. The results showed that seed germination was not significantly affected by arsenic (As) levels lower than 25 mg L-1, indicating that this grass has a relatively high tolerance of As at the germination stage. The decrease in germination observed at 25 and 50 mg L-1 was due to increased seed mortality and to the reversible inhibition of the germination of viable seeds caused by As. The presence of the endophyte did not change the germination response to arsenic of one line, but affected negatively the germination of the other line.

Shoot-specific endophyte (Epichloe coenophiala)-infected tall fescue showed superior performance under both biotic and abiotic stress conditions. We performed a genome-wide association analysis using clonal pairs of novel endophyte AR584-positive (EP) and endophyte-free (EF) tall fescue populations consisting of 205 genotypes to identify marker-trait associations (MTAs) that contribute to drought tolerance. The experiment was performed through November 2014 to June 2018 in the field, and phenotypic data were taken on plant height, plant spread, plant vigor, and dry biomass weight under natural summer conditions of sporadic drought. Genotyping-by-sequencing of the population generated 3,597 high quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for further analysis. We identified 26 putative drought responsive MTAs (17 specific to EP, eight specific to EF, and one in both EP and EF populations) and nine of them (i.e., V.ep_10, S.ef_12, V.ep_27, HSV.ef_31, S.ep_30, SV.ef_32, V.ep_68, V.ef_56, and H.ef_57) were identified within 0.5 Mb region in the tall fescue genome (44.5-44.7, 75.3-75.8, 77.5-77.9 and 143.7-144.2 Mb). Using 26 MTAs, 11 tall fescue genotypes were selected for subsequent study to develop EP and EF drought tolerant tall fescue populations.

Weevils were also exposed to white clover with high or low levels of cyanogens, and to white clover selections bred conventionally to contain high or low levels of crude protein. These bioassays were carried out sometimes over a series of time intervals, and weevil survival, feeding, and reproductive performance variables were measured. Nicaeana cervina survival was generally high, although feeding and oviposition were variable between experiments despite high replication in some cases. A summary of significant differences obtained across all experiments suggested that data on the proportion of weevils feeding and amounts of leaf material consumed were more often significantly different than treatment effects on survival or reproductive performance. A positive relationship between the proportion of weevils feeding and those ovipositing was found, suggesting that a 50% reduction in feeding would result in a 28% reduction in the proportion of weevils ovipositing.

There were two 14-d periods, P1 and P2. During P1, animals were adapted to a concentrate (0.2% BW, as fed, twice daily) and alfalfa cubes. During P2, the seed was mixed into the concentrate portion of the diet and alfalfa cubes were offered ad libitum.

1942,"Tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum), an agronomically important forage grass, is typically associated with a mutualistic asexual fungus Neotyphodium coenophialum. Plant colonization is endophytic with no symptoms, and fungal growth is confined to the intercellular spaces. The endophyte enhances host fitness by providing protection from various abiotic and biotic stresses and by improving nutrient acquisition. By suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) we identified 29 genes that are up-regulated or down-regulated in endophyte-infected tall fescue as compared to endophyte-free tall fescue. Of the genes that had matches to known genes present in the NCBI databases (approximately 50%), several had roles related to plant defense and stress tolerance. Differential expression of these genes was confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, competitive RT-PCR, and northern hybridization. Endophyte-associated changes in gene expression patterns were consistent among cultivars of tall fescue but differed in some other grass-endophyte associations. Our results indicate that both partners in this symbiosis are active participants, and that the endophyte may be suppressing at least one plant defense gene (putatively encoding PR-10).

A pot experiment under endophyte infection (EI and EF) and saline-alkali stress treatments (0, 200, 400 and 600 mmol/L) was conducted. There are five replicates per treatment. AMF diversity in roots of tall fescue is determined by high throughput sequencing. The diversity of AMF in EF tall fescue roots decreased with the increase of saline-alkali stress treatment level, and the presence of the endophytes alleviated this effect. Under the 200 and 400 mmol/L saline-alkali stress treatments, the endophytes increased the diversity of AMF in tall fescue roots; in addition, the endophytes caused a shift in AMF community composition, reducing the relative abundance of Funneliformis and increasing the relative abundance of Claroideoglomus, Glomus and some unclassified AMF. The results of structural equation model (SEM) showed that the endophytes increased the AMF diversity of tall fescue roots by increasing the concentration of soil total phosphorus under saline-alkali stresses.

Understanding mechanisms regulating such functions is thus a major goal in ecology. 2. Fungal endophytes of grasses, particularly of the genus Neotyphodium, have been reported to reduce colonization of their host plant by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. However, it is unclear which mechanism(s) may explain the effects produced by the endophyte and whether these effects are present in nature. 3. We used Schedonorus phoenix (syn. Lolium arundinaceum) plants that were endophyte-free or infected with one of two strains of Neotyphodium coenophialum known to produce different putative allelochemicals to test the hypotheses that (i) allelopathic effects of the endophyte reduce AM fungal spore germination; and (ii) the allelochemical compound(s) are leached into the soil even after the death of S. phoenix, where they reduce AM fungal colonization of other plants. 4. In a first experiment, aqueous extracts from the shoots of S. phoenix were applied onto spores of the AM fungus Glomus intraradices to test germination effects. Both endophyte strains reduced spore germination by approximately 10% relative to endophyte-free controls. 5. In a second experiment, we placed dried shoot material ('thatch') on the soil surface of pots containing Bromus inermis, which were either inoculated with G. intraradices or not. We watered the plants through the thatch, relying upon leaching to translocate potential allelochemicals to the soil. AM fungal colonization of B. inermis was significantly reduced when thatch was infected with the common strain, but not with AR542, compared to the endophyte-free thatch. Furthermore, the arbuscule : vesicle ratio was 11-fold smaller when thatch was infected with the common strain compared to endophyte-free thatch, suggesting that G. intraradices was stressed by the presence of common strain-leachate. 6. We observed situations whereby two ecologically widespread plant-microbe symbioses interact.

Compared with cereal species and intermediate wheatgrass (Elytrigia intermedia (Host) Nevski subsp. intermedia), turfgrass species were not as susceptible to Russian wheat aphid. Festuca spp. were better hosts than other grass species. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L. 'Repell' and 'Regal') had resistance 6 wk after infestation. Redtop (Agrostis alba L.

Methods and ResultsThe resistance of pot-grown wheat to heat or drought stress was measured by quantifying efficiency of photosystem II (F-v/F-m), plant height, average seed weight (ASW), total seed weight (TSW), water-use efficiency (WUE) as well as time to 50% germination and percentage germination of second-generation seeds produced under heat stress, drought stress or well-watered conditions. The endophytic fungi tested increased wheat tolerance for drought and heat. Endophyte SMCD 2206 was the most beneficial, followed by SMCD 2210 and 2215. Surprisingly, second-generation seeds produced by drought-stressed wheat colonized by SMCD 2206, 2210 or 2215 had decreased WUE relative to those produced by endophyte-free, drought-stressed plants.

Renovation of endophyte-infected (E+) pastures with endophyte-free (E-) cultivars of tall fescue or perennial ryegrass has resulted in improved animal performance, but productivity and stand persistence of the grasses have been reduced. Stand loss of E- tall fescue has been attributed to a number of stresses, including insect attack, disease, root predation by nematodes, and drought stress. The Acremonium endophyte has been observed to stimulate the tall fescue plant's production of chitinase, an enzyme associated with disease resistance. Nematode resistance, which can also be enhanced in E+ plants, has been attributed, in part, to thickening of the root endodermal layer. Drought stress has been identified as the most common cause of E- tall fescue stand loss in the eastern United States. Endophyte-infected tall fescue plants exhibit several adaptive morphological and physiological responses to drought stress compared with E- plants.

These decreases in productivity have been estimated to cost beef producers more than $600 million annually. The unthrifty appearance of cattle consuming endophyte-infected tall fescue (E+) is most evident during periods of environmental heat or cold stress, suggesting an interaction with environmental conditions. Without temperature stress, cows consumed similar amounts of E+ and endophyte-free tall fescue (E-). But, when temperatures exceeded 32 degrees C, cows that grazed E+ consumed less forage than cows that grazed E-. After removal of E+ from the diet of steers, compensatory growth was observed, indicating no long-term negative effects of E+. A decrease in serum prolactin but apparently little change in other hormones has been measured after consumption of E+. Under periods of heat stress, animals had reduced ability to dissipate body heat, and blood flow to peripheral (rib skin), core-body (duodenum colon), and brain (cerebellum) tissues was decreased. Due to the depressive effects of E+ on prolactin and heat dissipation, dopamine antagonist therapy has been used in an attempt to rectify these changes. Dopamine antagonists have increased serum prolactin but there is limited evidence to suggest an improvement in heat dissipation.

3460,"Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is naturally infected with a fungal endophyte, Neotyphodium coenophialum, which produces toxic ergot alkaloids that negatively affect herbivores and that may alter soil organic matter dynamics. A 60-week mesocosm study with a factorial arrangement of soil type (clay loam and loamy sand) and endophyte infection (with and without) was conducted to determine potential changes in soil C and N fractions. Forage and root dry-matter production were greater with than without endophyte infection, while forage C and N concentrations were unaffected. Total, particulate, mineralizable, and aggregate-associated C and N fractions increased several fold during the course of the experiment due to large rhizosphere inputs in all treatments. The fraction of total C and N in water-stable macroaggregates (> 0.25 mm) was initially 0.43 +/- 0.10 and 0.46 +/- 0.16, respectively, and increased during the course of the experiment to 0.68 +/- 0.06 and 0.56 +/- 0.15 when averaged across soil type and endophyte infection level as a result of organic matter cycling and deposition in this active biophysical fraction. Changes in soil C and N fractions due to endophyte infection were minimal. The lack of detectable changes in soil C and N fractions due to endophyte infection may have been a result of the overwhelming input of C from roots and/or the relatively short-term nature (60 weeks).

Objectives were to determine the trends in crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), and in vitro true digestibility (IVTD) of 10 cultivars of tall fescue (Festuca arundinaceae Schreb.) at five levels of irrigation and three harvest dates (early, mid-, and late season). A secondary objective was to evaluate the effect of the endophytic fungus [Neotyphodium coenophialum (Morgan-Jones & Gams) Glenn, Bacon & Hanlin] on these trends. Cultivars differed significantly for CP, NDF, and IVTD, and differences were generally consistent across water levels (WLs). Concentration of CP increased in a near linear manner (154-189 g kg(-1)) from the highest to lowest WL; however, total protein yield decreased from 611 to 447 kg ha(-1) with less water, closely following the trend in forage yield. Forage quality at the late-season harvest, as indicated by lower NDF and higher IVTD values, was significantly higher at the lowest compared with the highest WL. Also, NDF was significantly lower and IVTD significantly higher at the late-season harvest at all WL. Presence or absence of the endophyte was not associated with CP; however, there was a tendency for the endophyte-free cultivar to have lower NDF and higher IVTD than its endophyte-infected counterpart at the higher WL.

Native prairies are frequently managed with interactive fire and grazing, yet little is known regarding tall fescue's endophytic and toxicological responses. From 2012 to 2014, we applied patch-burn grazing (PBG-burning a different third annually) or graze and burn (GAB-burning completely in 2012 but no fire in 2013 or 2014) treatments to tall fescue-invaded grasslands. Burning happened in March/April, and cattle grazing occurred during the growing season. Tall fescue tillers were analyzed for Epichloe endophyte presence and alkaloid concentrations (ergovaline, ergovalinine, N-acetylnorloline, N-formylloline, N-acetylloline). Cattle toxicosis was assessed via fecal ergovaline levels. With PBG, tiller defoliation was greater in burned patches versus unburned and was greater than any years in GAB. In GAB, tiller defoliation was no different the year of the burn than the years without fire. Cattle did not discriminate between endophyte-infected or endophyte-free tillers in either treatment. Endophyte infection levels were inversely related to years since fire (YSF), and various alkaloids displayed asynchronous responses to YSF. Cattle had no detectable fecal ergovaline when managed with patchy or complete pasture fires. Only two herds had detectable fecal ergovaline (> 100 ppb), which were in pastures managed without fire and only in 2013. Thus, patch burning tall fescue-invaded grasslands alters alkaloids and tiller defoliation with implications for cattle toxicosis.

After characterizing the root-associated fungal endophyte communities of both species in two distinct Antarctic terrestrial habitats-hill and coast-we experimentally assessed the contribution of fungal endophytes to plant adaptation in each habitat. The field reciprocal transplant experiment involved removing endophytes from a set of plants and crossing symbiotic status (with and without endophytes) with habitat for both species, aiming to assess plant performance and fitness. The diversity of root fungal endophytes was similar between habitats and mainly explained by plant species, although habitat-specific endophyte community structures were identified in D. antarctica. Endophytes significantly influenced C. quitensis homeostatic regulation, including oxidative stress and osmotic control, as well as plant fitness in both environments. By contrast, the effect of endophytes on D. antarctica was particularly evident in coastal sites, suggesting an endophyte-mediated improvement in local adaptation. Altogether, our results suggest that the two Antarctic vascular plant species follow different strategies in recruiting and developing functional symbiosis with root-associated fungal communities.

We hypothetically proposed that the loss of indigenous endophytes in tissue culture propagation of banana might be related to increased disease severity on banana plants. In the present study, a mixture of uncultivated endophytes, which was originally derived from native healthy banana plant in plantation, was used to artificially inoculate banana tissue culture plantlets. A broad spectrum of bacterial communities was detected in the roots of artificially inoculated plantlets by 16S ribosomal RNA gene analysis, and gamma-Proteobacteria was identified as the dominant group. Banana wilt pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense race 4 was inoculated to the plantlets after potting to investigate disease progress. With early diagnosis of fungal pathogen infection, 54% reduction was detected in artificially inoculated plantlets compared to endophyte-free control plantlets. The re-introduction of naturally-occurring endophytes into tissue culture banana plantlets led to a 67% suppression rate of wilt disease at the fifth month after pathogen infection on plantlets in the greenhouse.

15248,"Almost all plants in forest ecosystems live in symbiosis with endophytes, and many plants cannot grow normally without endophytes. In recent years, the importance of endophytes for plant growth and health has gradually attracted attention. However, most current studies focused on crops, and studies on woody plant endophytes, especially seed-related endophytes, are very rare. There are many species of endophytes in woody plant seeds, which are divided into endophytic bacteria (e.g., Pseudomonas, Bacillus sp., and Erwinia spp.), endophytic fungi (e.g., Alternaria sp., Cladosporium sp., and Fusarium sp.), and endophytic actinomycetes (e.g., Streptomyces and Nocardiopsis). Microorganisms in the environment colonize various organs of woody plants: through the rhizosphere, caulosphere, phyllosphere, anthosphere, or carposphere, and are transmitted to the seeds to form seed endophytes. Endophytes occupy niches such as endosperms, embryos, and endosperms in seeds. Host plants can choose beneficial endophytes to transmit vertically to the next generation through seeds. Woody plant seed endophytes can directly promote seed germination and seedling establishment and produce secondary metabolites to prevent plant diseases and protect plant health. However, some woody plant seed endophytes are harmful to seed germination and plant growth. With the development of metagenomics technology, it will be possible to research seed endophyte species, colonization, and transmission methods at the molecular level. In addition, studying the secondary metabolites of woody plant seed endophytes could have practical applications in plant disease and pest control. © 2022 Science Press.

We investigated the life tables of the two-spotted spider mite T. urticae on fungal endophyte Beauveria bassiana colonized and untreated plants of the common Phaseolus vulgaris L., a bean plant. Based on the age-stage, two-sex life table theory, data were evaluated. The mites raised on untreated plants had protonymphs, deutonymphs, and total pre-adult stage durations that were considerably shorter (1.76, 2.14, and 9.77 d, respectively) than the mites raised on plants that had been colonized (2.02, 2.45, and 10.49 d, respectively). The fecundity (F) varied from 28.01 eggs per female of colonized plants to 57.67 eggs per female of endophyte-untreated plants.

Novel safe endophyte/grass associations produce no ergot alkaloids yet retain stand persistence, but they could be more susceptible to insect outbreaks. We tested the hypothesis that grass-feeding insects are more abundant in novel endophyte pastures compared with those containing common endophyte. Above- and below-ground herbivores were sampled across two growing seasons in pastures containing common strain endophyte (KY31), novel endophytes (MaxQ or AR584) or endophyte free. We also sampled natural enemies as an indicator of possible tritrophic effects. With a few exceptions, numbers of predatory, chewing (grasshoppers, crickets, caterpillars) or sucking insects (leafhoppers, planthoppers) were similar in common and novel endophyte pastures. Contrary to our hypothesis, Aphrodes spp. leafhoppers were more abundant in KY31 than other pasture types in 2008; their nymphs also were more abundant in KY31 than in MaxQ in 2009.

In this study, we investigated how an aphid-transmitted viral pathogen and a symbiotic endophytic fungus altered host growth and allocation. We hypothesized that, by reducing aphid feeding, endophyte infection would lower viral titre and consequently decrease the negative effects of virus infection on host biomass production. In a greenhouse experiment, we manipulated fungal endophyte status and virus infection (Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus - PAV) of two tall fescue cultivars with different genetic backgrounds [KY 31 and pasture demonstration farm (PDF)]. In one cultivar (PDF), we also manipulated endophyte strain, using two strains that had been selected for differences in alkaloid production. We assessed host, virus and vector responses. As hypothesized, endophyte infection decreased reproduction and abundance of aphid vectors; however, in contrast to our hypothesis, this response by aphids did not impact viral titre. For both tall fescue cultivars, endophyte infection alleviated the negative effect of virus infection on the proportion of total plant biomass allocated to roots.

The hypothesis in this study was that the presence of EpichloA << coenophialum in the tall fescue shoot may alter chemical and biological properties of rhizospheric soil and, as a consequence, the soil hydraulic properties and aggregate stability in texture-dependent ways. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to characterize the effects of endophyte-tall fescue symbiosis on water repellency and hydraulic properties of the rhizosphere in six soil types. Aggregate water/ethanol sorptivities and water repellency were determined using a tension micro-infiltrometer. Soil organic carbon, hot-water soluble carbohydrates, basal soil respiration and water-dispersible clay as an index of aggregate instability were also measured. Endophytic symbiosis greatly enhanced soil organic carbon pools and hot-water soluble carbohydrates, especially for the medium- to fine-textured soils, and decreased the basal soil respiration. Changes in chemical and biological properties of the rhizosphere via endophyte infection and soil type altered the soil water repellency, hydraulic properties, and aggregate stability. Lower water sorptivity (due to hydrophobic coatings) and higher ethanol sorptivity (due to altered pore structure) were responsible for greater water repellency in the rhizosphere of endophyte-infected plants compared to endophyte-free ones.

10741,"Endophytes of the Neotyphodium/Epichloe complex are filamentous fungi that typically form mutualistic associations with temperate grasses. The endophytes systemically colonise the intercellular spaces of their grass hosts and confer several biotic and abiotic attributes, but can also cause mammalian toxicoses. These symbioses are therefore of significant agricultural importance, and furthermore, the symbioses represent models to understand how such symbioses are established and maintained. To gain a greater understanding of the Neotyphodium lolii-perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) symbiosis, we have generated, sequenced and analysed four in planta expressed sequence tag libraries, enriched for genes differentially expressed during symbiosis via suppression subtractive hybridisation. Subtracted libraries were largely comprised of perennial ryegrass sequences, and comparative functional profiling of endophyte-infected ryegrass libraries with endophyte-free ryegrass libraries revealed downregulation of carbohydrate metabolism and photosynthesis during symbiosis, the latter confirming observations made in previous studies. Functional categories upregulated in the plant host in association with endophyte infection included cellular protein transport and protein synthesis and turnover. We also identified 24 N. lolii transcripts expressed during symbiosis, some of which were homologous to demonstrated pathogenicity/virulence genes, and others with proven roles in endophyte secondary metabolism.

Methods Endophyte-infected plants were segregated over the first 3 years to produce high-endophyte subpopulation, and field and greenhouse experiments were carried out in the forth and fifth to determine the cold tolerance of the L. perenne subpopulation with high endophyte infection rates (N), the parent (F), the control endophyte-free subpopulation (E) and the control local variety (L). Results (1) After 3 years of screening, high endophyte infection rates in the tillers and seeds of plants were still observed (96.5%), and agronomic traits (crown width, plant height, panicle number, withering, regreen-up, the growth cycle and the over-wintering rate) was also improved with increased Epichloe colonization of host plant. (2) The subpopulation with high endophyte infection rates and improved agronomic traits had better cold tolerance than the parent, the control endophyte-free subpopulation and the control local variety. The possible mechanisms by which high endophyte infection enhances cold resistance in the field include increased root system, increased the over-wintering rate, reduced regrowth periods with the sowing date being October 15th.

13552,"Seedborne, nonpathogenic, fungal endophytes are commonly found in symbiotic relationships with many members of the cool-season grass subfamily Pooideae. The beneficial effects on plants possessing fungal endophytes, and the detrimental effects on consumers of fungal endophyte-infected plants are widely known. The objective of our research was to determine if fungal endophytes exist in indigenous, wild Triticum (wheat) species from Turkey. From the Triticum species collected, we found two different fungal endophytes. Fungi identified morphologically as members of the genus Neotyphodium were found in the diploid Triticum species T. dichasians (Zhuk.) Bowden and T. tripsacoides (Jaub. and Spach) Bowden. The second endophyte, an Acremonium species, was found in T. columnare (Zhuk.) Morris and Sears, T. cylindricum Ces., T. monococcum L., T. neglecta Morris and Sears, T. recta Morris and Sears, T. triunciale (L.) Raspail, T. turgidum L., and T. umbellulatum (Zhuk.) Bowden.

Both Acremonium endophyte-infected and Acremonium endophyte-free plants of T. triunciale were found to occur at different frequencies at four collection sites on the Anatolian Plateau. Through two selfed generations of the plants, it was found that the Neotyphodium endophyte was transmitted to 100% of the progeny of T. dichasians and T. tripsacoides. However, the Acremonium endophytes were not transmitted in all plants that originally possessed them. We concluded that fungal endophytes of the genera Neotyphodium and Acremonium inhabit some wild wheat species grown indigenously in Turkey.

1588,"The relationship between vertically transmitted asexual fungal grass endophytes and their hosts is considered to be mutualistic. Results from agronomic field support this line of reasoning but recent studies have shown more variable results in natural systems. We investigated how high and low nutrient and water treatments affected biomass allocation patterns of endophyte-infected and uninfected Festuca pratensis and F. rubra in greenhouse experiments over two growing seasons. Irrespective of infection status, both grass species showed improved performance on highly fertilized and watered soils. However, infected F. pratensis plants produced larger tillers than endophyte-free plants on soil low in nutrients and water in the first growing season, although they (E +) otherwise showed decreased performance on nutrient-poor soil. In low nutrient and water conditions, endophyte-infected plants produced less tillers and had lower total biomass compared to uninfected plants, and displayed a negative phenotypic correlation between seed production and vegetative growth. The latter indicates costs of reproduction when the plant shares common resources with the fungal endophyte. However, endophyte infection status (E +, E -) interacted significantly with the soil fertilisation in terms of plant growth, having a stronger positive effect on growth in infected F. pratensis plants. In F. rubro, endophyte-infected plants showed higher vegetative growth in fertilized and watered soils compared to uninfected plants. However, infected plants tended to produce fewer inflorescences, This had no effect on seed production, perhaps because seed production was partly replaced by asexual pseudovivipary. Contrary to the general assumption in the literature that fungal endophytes are plant mutualists, these findings suggest that the costs of endophytes may outweigh their benefits in resource limited conditions. However, the costs of endophyte infections appear to differ among the grass species studied; costs of endophytes were mainly detected in F. pratensis under low nutrient conditions.

In this study, we used the interaction between the root endophyte Serendipita indica and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants to explore how specialised metabolism of the host plant is regulated upon a mutualistic symbiotic association. To do so, tomato seedlings were inoculated with S. indica chlamydospores and subjected to RNAseq analysis. Gene expression of the main tomato specialised metabolism pathways was compared between roots and leaves of endophyte-colonised plants and tissues of endophyte-free plants. S. indica colonisation resulted in a strong transcriptional response in the leaves of colonised plants.

Endophyte-conferred plant defence via alkaloid biosynthesis might occur independently of costs for host plant growth. However, fitness consequences of endophyte-conferred defence and transgenerational effects on herbivore resistance of progeny plants are rarely studied. The aim of this study was to test whether severe defoliation in mother plants affects their seed production, seed germination rate and the endophyte-conferred resistance of progeny plants.Methods In a field study, we tested the effects of defoliation and endophyte symbiosis (Epichlo & euml; uncinata) on host plant (Festuca pratensis) performance, loline alkaloid concentrations in leaves and seeds, seed biomass and seed germination rates. In a subsequent greenhouse study, we challenged the progeny of the plants from the field study to aphid herbivory and tested whether defoliation of mother plants affects endophyte-conferred resistance against aphids in progeny plants.Key Results Defoliation of the mother plants resulted in a reduction of alkaloid concentrations in leaves and elevated the alkaloid concentrations in seeds when compared with non-defoliated endophyte-symbiotic plants. Viability and germination rate of seeds of defoliated endophyte-symbiotic plants were significantly lower compared with those of non-defoliated endophyte-symbiotic plants and endophyte-free (defoliated and non-defoliated) plants.

In E+ treated animals, prolactin concentrations dropped significantly (P < .001) from d 27. Hay assessment in both experiments showed no difference in chemical composition and IVDMD. The endophytic fungus strongly lowered the palatability of the E+ hay, although there was no effect on intake with heifers (Exp. 1) or with lambs (Exp. 2).

2263,"Endophyte-mediated salinity tolerance is largely unknown in tall fescue [Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.)]. The experiment was designed to characterize growth, ion accumulation, and antioxidant metabolism of tall fescue infected by the endophyte Epichloe coenophiala to different levels of salinity stress. Endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) tall fescue (cv Kentucky 31) plants were exposed to 10 d of 0 (unstressed control), 100 and 200 mM NaCl treatments in a greenhouse, respectively. Salinity stress caused reductions in plant height, leaf fresh weight (LFW), leaf dry weight (LDW), and leaf water content (LWC), and increased Na+ concentration, but E + plants had significantly higher LFW, LDW, and LWC under both NaCl treatments and lower Na+ than E- plants under 200 mM NaCl. Salinity stress decreased K+ and Mg2+ and did not alter P, and increased Ca2+ in E + plants and caused no change in Ca2+ in E- plants; however, endophyte had no effects on these elements. Chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm), malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) remained unchanged in E + plants, but Fv/Fm was reduced and MDA level and enzyme activities were elevated in E- plants under 200 mM NaCl, where E + plants had significantly higher Fv/Fm and lower MDA, SOD, and APX activities than E- plants. Peroxidase activities increased in E + plants under 200 mM NaCl and in E- plants under both NaCl treatments. The results indicated that endophyte promoted salinity tolerance in tall fescue through maintaining higher growth and photochemical efficiency and lowering Na+ accumulation and lipid peroxidation.

4221,"Grass infection by endophyte fungi can confer host resistance to different types of stress, but limited evidence is available on the related effects on the photosynthetic mechanism of the grasses. Zinc has direct and indirect effects on this mechanism and is one of the more important environmental pollutants. To measure whether photosynthesis of the host plant is affected by fungal infection when endophyte-free and endophyte-infected grasses contain similar excess zinc concentrations in their leaves, two batches of Lolium perenne L. cv. Apollo plants were established, one batch was infected with Neotyphodium lolii, the other was not. Both batches were then treated for 8 d with a nutrient solution containing 0, 1, 5, 10 or 20 mM ZnSO4. The increase in zinc concentration induced some reduction in photosystem II ( PSII) activity but not enough to account for the total drop in the net photosynthetic rate. Endophyte fungus favoured maintenance of the PSII activity, but did not significantly modify the net photosynthesis and similar zinc concentration levels were observed in leaves of both types of plant. Interactive effects of zinc and light induced less photodamage to the PSII of the host, which is able to react to an increase in photon flux density (PFD).

2567,"Ecophysiology of the endophyte (Acremonium coenophialum Morgan-Jones and Gams)-tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) association needs to be understood in order to promote environmental fitness traits of the association while reducing its deleterious effects on ruminants. Our objective was to determine the influence of endophyte on drought stress tolerance, persistence, and yield components of field-grown tall fescue on a Typic Hapludalfs soil. A water supply gradient was established during 1989 and 1989 with line-source irrigation on established populations of 0 and 80% endophyte-infected tall fescue. Whole plots consisted of endophyte infection status, across which a gradient of water was applied in a strip-split fashion with eight replicates. Tiller population density and herbage yield were determined every 28 d and yield components were measured on selected dates. Relative to populations receiving high irrigation (375-650 mm applied), tiller density in nonirrigated stands (0-50 mm applied) from July to October 1988 was reduced an average of 42% in infected tall fescue and 55% in noninfected tall fescue. Tiller density of nonirrigated, infected populations recovered fully to that of high irrigation treatments by 17 November, whereas that of nonirrigated, endophyte-free populations recovered to only 62% of irrigated treatments. The advantage in population density due to endophyte infection continued throughout 1989, a relatively wet year. A benefit in total forage yield due to endophyte infection was not consistently evident because of greater yield per tiller in endophyte-free stands in 1989.

1198,"1. Grasslands store a third of global terrestrial carbon but are vulnerable to carbon loss due to inappropriate livestock grazing. Grasslands management can be improved with a mechanistic understanding of biogeochemical processes that determine carbon storage, such as plant litter decomposition. 2. Herbicides, such as glyphosate, are used to improve the quantity and quality of the forage. In the Flooding Pampa, the most extensive cattle grazed natural grassland and one of the few remnants' temperate grasslands in South America-glyphosate is applied to promote Lolium multiflorum, a forage grass associated with a fungal endophyte nontoxic for cattle. 3. We studied five mechanistic pathways in which the application of glyphosate can alter litter decomposition. We grouped them into single application pathways, through effects on living plants (1), leaf litter (2) and bare soil (3), and repeated annual application pathways, through legacies on ecosystem properties (4) and through the growth of an annual forage grass with a fungal endophyte (5). Single application pathways were tested in a greenhouse experiment using leaf litter of L. multiflorum and of a native dominant grass. Repeated annual application pathways were tested through a field experiment with 3-year annual glyphosate application using leaf and root litter of L. multiflorum with and without endophyte association. 4. Glyphosate application on living plants produced leaf litter with 70% higher nitrogen content and 140% higher decomposition constant than naturally senesced litter. In contrast, glyphosate application on naturally senesced leaf litter reduced decomposition constant by 20%. Glyphosate application on the soil did not affect the decomposition of naturally senesced leaf litter but accelerated the decomposition of the glyphosate-killed plants even more. 5. Legacies of repeated annual application of glyphosate resulted in a notable reduction in plant cover (45%) and potential soil respiration (57%), with a consistent acceleration of leaf (53%) and root (18%) litter decomposition. Furthermore, endophytes in L. multiflorum plants reduced leaf litter decomposition by 22%. On the contrary, endophytes did not alter root litter decomposition. 6. Glyphosate application on living plants and legacies of repeated application on the ecosystem stimulate litter decomposition, which can result in a net carbon loss from grasslands.

10340,"Endophytic fungi live their whole life within host tissues usually without any visible symptoms. Their vertical transmission (seed-plant-seed) has been well described and documented. However, horizontal transmission (plant-plant) needs more clarification. The aim of this study was to assess the extent to which endophytes move vertically in ecotypes of perennial ryegrass and whether there is evidence for the horizontal transmission of endophytes. Ecotypes from grasslands in Poland were collected in the form of living plants and used for vertical transmission analysis. Plants, the seed collected from these plants and plants grown from this collected seed were tested for endophytic infection. Provided that all produced seeds were viable and able to germinate and produce seedlings, the vertical transmission of Neotyphodium endophytes in perennial ryegrass ecotypes was nearly complete. For the horizontal transmission experiment, endophyte-hosting plants (E+) and endophyte-free plants (E-) of four cultivars were planted in the field in close proximity on small plots that were frequently mown.

895,"Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is grown as a forage, turfgrass, and conservation grass from the Gulf Coast to Canada in the eastern USA. The presence of endophytes in grasses can confer resistance to insect pests, enhance growth, and improve tall fescue persistence under high temperature and drought stress. Most tall fescue is infected with Acremonium cenophialum Morgan-Jones & Gams, a fungal endophyte. Our objectives were to determine the effects of endophyte infection on water relations and survival of water stressed (i.e., drought-stressed) tall fescue under greenhouse conditions. Endophyte-free and infected plants of three tall fescue selections were vegetatively propagated and grown together in 38-L weighing lysimeters to allow interplant competition for available soil moisture. Irrigation water and fertilizer were applied for 12 wk after planting before irrigation water was withheld for 8 wk. Water-relation characteristics including full-turgor osmotic potential (psi(pi100)), water potential at zero turgor (psi(L0)), relative water content at zero turgor (RWC0), apoplastic water fraction (beta), bulk modulus of tissue elasticity (epsilon), and the turgid weight to dry weight ratio (TW/DW) were determined before and after water stress. Osmotic adjustment (DELTApsi(pi)) was also determined. Endophyte infection did not affect psi(pi100), psi(L0), RWC0, and beta either before or after water stress and did not affect DELTApsi(pi). Endophyte infection did affect epsilon and the TW/DW ratio, but this effect was not sufficient to alter psi(L0).

1616,"While much is known about the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites by filamentous fungi their biological role is often less clear. The assumption is these pathways have adaptive value to the organism but often the evidence to support this role is lacking. We provide the first genetic evidence that the fungal produced secondary metabolite, peramine, protects a host plant from insect herbivory. Peramine is a potent insect feeding deterrent synthesized by Epichloe/Neotyphodium mutualistic endophytes in association with their grass hosts. The structure of peramine, a pyrrolopyrazine, suggests that it is the product of a reaction catalysed by a two-module non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). Candidate sequences for a peramine synthetase were amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Four unique NRPS products were identified, two of which were preferentially expressed in planta. One of these hybridized to known peramine producing strains. This clone was used to isolate an Epichloe festucae cosmid that contained a two-module NRPS, designated perA. Nine additional genes, which show striking conservation of microsynteny with Fusarium graminearum and other fungal genomes, were identified on the perA-containing cosmid. Associations between perennial ryegrass and an E. festucae mutant deleted for perA lack detectable levels of peramine. A wild-type copy of perA complemented the deletion mutant, confirming that perA is a NRPS required for peramine biosynthesis. In a choice bioassay, plant material containing the perA mutant was as susceptible to Argentine stem weevil (ASW) (Listronotus bonariensis) feeding damage as endophyte-free plants confirming that peramine is the E. festucae metabolite responsible for ASW feeding deterrent activity.",2005,Presence,Presence,3,2,Medium,endophyte-free,amplified,perA mutant was as susceptible to Argentine stem weevil (ASW) (Listronotus bonariensis) feeding damage as endophyte-free plants confirming that peramine is the E. festucae metabolite responsible for ASW feeding deterrent activity.,"catalysed by a two-module non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS).
