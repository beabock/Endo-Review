# Unrepresented Plant Taxa: Gap Analysis

## Executive Summary
Our analysis identified **687** plant families and **17,807** plant genera that were completely absent from the literature analyzed. These 'taxonomic blind spots' represent significant opportunities for future research.

## Major Family Gaps
The single largest unrepresented plant family was **Plagiochilaceae**, which contains approximately 687 known species but had zero representation in our dataset. Other prominent families with zero detected species include:

- Frullaniaceae (618 spp.)
- Brachytheciaceae (610 spp.)
- Sematophyllaceae (573 spp.)
- Fissidentaceae (527 spp.)
- Thesiaceae (378 spp.)

## Breakdown by Phylum
The following list highlights the largest missing families within each major plant phylum:

- **Anthocerotophyta**: Notable absences include Leiosporocerotaceae (1 spp.).
- **Bryophyta**: Notable absences include Brachytheciaceae (610 spp.), Sematophyllaceae (573 spp.), Fissidentaceae (527 spp.).
- **Charophyta**: Notable absences include Characeae (224 spp.), Desmidiaceae (158 spp.), Coleochaetaceae (19 spp.).
