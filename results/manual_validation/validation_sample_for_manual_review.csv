1045,Characterisation of novel perennial ryegrass host-Neotyphodium endophyte associations,"The temperate pasture grass Lolium perenne L. is commonly found in symbiotic association with the asexual fungal endophyte Neotyphodium lolii. Levels of endophyte colonisation and alkaloid content were evaluated in associations formed by plant genotypes from cv. Bronsyn with the standard endophyte (SE) and five distinct commercial endophyte strains. Bronsyn-SE produced all of the measured alkaloids (lolitrem B, peramine, and ergovaline). Bronsyn-AR1 produced only peramine, while Bronsyn-AR37 produced none of the tested alkaloids. Bronsyn-NEA2, Bronsyn-NEA3, and Bronsyn-NEA6 produced both ergovaline and peramine. Both endophyte strain and host genotype exerted significant effects on alkaloid production. Analysis of endophyte colonisation using qPCR revealed differences between each association. With the exception of Bronsyn-AR1 and Bronsyn-NEA3, host genotype also significantly affected colonisation levels. Phenotypic performance of each association was also assessed, based on measurement of morphological traits under glasshouse conditions in hydroponic culture. Significant variation due to different endophyte and host genotypes was observed. Collectively, these studies confirm that differences in both endophyte and host genotypes contribute to host-endophyte performance in a complex interactive manner.","Tian, P; Le, TN; Ludlow, EJ; Smith, KF; Forster, JW; Guthridge, KM; Spangenberg, GC",CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE,2013,10.1071/CP13067,0.837918729446153,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99999997897267,2.10273300513482e-8,1,0,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,lolium perenne,lolium perenne,2706241,Lolium perenne,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Poaceae,Lolium,Lolium perenne,ACCEPTED,Lolium perenne,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,temperate,FALSE,temperate,1,High (≥0.9),3,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_002
38,Endophytic Fungal Community of Pinus densiflora Infected by Different Incidences of Sphaeropsis sapinea in a Mixed Coniferous Forest,"Shoot blight of pine caused by Sphaeropsis sapinea is a serious threat to the health of Pinus densiflora. However, little is known about the effect of S. sapinea on the structure of endophytic fungal communities in needles of P. densiflora. In this study, the diversity and structure of the endophytic fungal communities associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic needles of P. densiflora were investigated. Needles of P. densiflora were sampled from mixed coniferous forests, and high through-put sequencing was used to determine the diversity and community structure of endophytic fungi. The results demonstrated that endophytic fungal abundance increased when the lesion length was longer, and the endophytic fungal diversity showed an upward trend as the infection of S. sapinea worsened. The dominant genera of endophytic fungi in asymptomatic needles of P. densiflora in mixed coniferous forest was Paraconiothyrium and Selenophoma. Cenangium is considered to have a certain association with S. sapinea infection in the endophytic fungal community. The results showed that S. sapinea infection affected the endophytic fungal community in needles of P. densiflora in a mixed coniferous forest.

1546,Spatial responses of two herbivore groups to a geometrid larva on mountain birch,"Direct or plant-mediated interactions between herbivores may modify their spatial distribution among and within plants. In this study, we examined the effect of a leaf-chewing geometrid, the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata), on two different herbivore groups, leaf rolling Deporaus betulae weevils and Eriocrania spp. leafminers, both feeding on mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii). The exact locations of herbivores within tree canopies were mapped during three successive summers. In the first 2 years, some trees were artificially colonized by eggs of the autumnal moth to induce both rapid and delayed resistance in the foliage. The natural infection levels of the pathogenic rust fungus (Melampsoridium betulinum), potentially involved in species interactions, were also recorded. At the level of the whole tree, the density of D. betulae leaf rolls was lower in trees infested by the autumnal moth in the same year. However, the feeding locations within trees were partly segregated: D. betulae favoured shadier branches, while E. autumnata preferred the sunny parts of the canopy. The autumnal moth did not affect current- or following-year density of leafminers at the tree or branch level. Trees infected by rust had fewer leafminers in the same summer than noninfected trees. There were no interaction effects between defoliation by the autumnal moth and rust infection, and no delayed effects on the abundance of other herbivores the following year. Taken together, these findings suggest that the autumnal moth has a negative, partially plant-mediated impact on D. betulae, and can reduce the extent of current-year defoliation caused by D. betulae. This may be beneficial for the mountain birch, since the greater part of D. betulae damage occurs around or after the end of the larval period of the autumnal moth, which may be a critical time for tree recovery after moth outbreaks.","Riihimäki, J; Kaitaniemi, P; Ruohomäki, K",OECOLOGIA,2003,10.1007/s00442-002-1082-6,0.699451620787856,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.96390239259463,0.03609760740537,0.99999999994138,5.861955365560329e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,betula pubescens,betula pubescens,9118014,Betula pubescens,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Betulaceae,Betula,Betula pubescens,ACCEPTED,Betula pubescens,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,leaf; foliage; branches; canopy; branch,5,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States,0.99999999994138,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_004
19737,Effects of Tall Fescue Endophyte Type and Dopamine Receptor D2 Genotype on Cow-Calf Performance during Late Gestation and Early Lactation.,"Grazing endophyte-infected, toxic tall fescue reduces cow/calf production; therefore, this study examines alternate strategies such as use of novel endophyte fescue varieties during late gestation and early lactation or genetic selection of resistant cows. Pregnant cows (n = 75) were randomly assigned to fescue endophyte type: 1) endophyte-infected ergot alkaloid producing tall fescue (E+) or 2) novel endophyte-infected, non-toxic tall fescue (NOV) within maternal (A|A, n = 38 and G|G, n = 37) DRD2 genotype to examine changes in cow/calf performance and milk production during late gestation and early lactation. Grazing E+ fescue pastures during late gestation reduced cow body weight gain but did not alter calf birth weight compared to NOV. Milk production and calf ADG during the first 30 day of lactation were lower for E+ than NOV. The calving rate was reduced, but not calving interval for E+ cows. The adjusted 205-day weight of calves was lower in those grazing E+ with their dams compared to NOV. There were no interactions between DRD2 genotype and fescue endophyte type indicating that genotype was not associated with response to E+ fescue in this study. Overall, grazing NOV tall fescue pastures rather than E+ during critical stages of production improved cow gain during late gestation, calving rate, early milk production and calf growth.",Wilbanks SA; Justice SM; West T; Klotz JL; Andrae JG; Duckett SK,Toxins,2021,10.3390/toxins13030195,0.874570097224614,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.948710973845736,0.051289026154264,0.99999999872469,1.27531041282936e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NO_MATCH,NA,NA,NA,none,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,0.99999999872469,High (≥0.9),0,None (0 types),No species,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | No species,,,,,,,VAL_005
9875,Genomic landscape of a relict fir-associated fungus reveals rapid convergent adaptation towards endophytism,"Comparative and pan-genomic analyses of the endophytic fungus Pezicula neosporulosa (Helotiales, Ascomycota) from needles of the relict fir, Abies beshanzuensis, showed expansions of carbohydrate metabolism and secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes characteristic for unrelated plant-beneficial helotialean, such as dark septate endophytes and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi. The current species within the relatively young Pliocene genus Pezicula are predominantly saprotrophic, while P. neosporulosa lacks such features. To understand the genomic background of this putatively convergent evolution, we performed population analyses of 77 P. neosporulosa isolates. This revealed a mosaic structure of a dozen non-recombining and highly genetically polymorphic subpopulations with a unique mating system structure. We found that one idiomorph of a probably duplicated mat1-2 gene was found in putatively heterothallic isolates, while the other co-occurred with mat1-1 locus suggesting homothallic reproduction for these strains. Moreover, 24 and 81 genes implicated in plant cell-wall degradation and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, respectively, showed signatures of the balancing selection. These findings highlight the evolutionary pattern of the two gene families for allowing the fungus a rapid adaptation towards endophytism and facilitating diverse symbiotic interactions.","Yuan, ZL; Wu, Q; Xu, LX; Druzhinina, IS; Stukenbrock, EH; Nieuwenhuis, BPS; Zhong, ZH; Liu, ZJ; Wang, XY; Cai, F; Kubicek, CP; Shan, XL; Wang, JY; Shi, GH; Peng, L; Martin, FM",ISME JOURNAL,2022,10.1038/s41396-021-01176-6,0.959301236580305,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995982767898332,0.00401723210166808,0.999999996994275,3.00572489120299e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,pezicula neosporulosa,pezicula neosporulosa,7485872,Pezicula neosporulosa,Fungi,Ascomycota,Dermateaceae,Pezicula,Pezicula neosporulosa,ACCEPTED,Pezicula neosporulosa,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,mycorrhizal,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,0.999999996994275,High (≥0.9),3,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_006

5447,Bacterial endophytes as indicators of susceptibility to Cercospora Leaf Spot (CLS) disease in Beta vulgaris L.,"The fungus Cercospora beticola causes Cercospora Leaf Spot (CLS) of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.). Despite the global importance of this disease, durable resistance to CLS has still not been obtained. Therefore, the breeding of tolerant hybrids is a major goal for the sugar beet sector. Although recent studies have suggested that the leaf microbiome composition can offer useful predictors to assist plant breeders, this is an untapped resource in sugar beet breeding efforts. Using Ion GeneStudio S5 technology to sequence amplicons from seven 16S rRNA hypervariable regions, the most recurring endophytes discriminating CLS-symptomatic and symptomless sea beets (Beta vulgaris L.ssp. maritima) were identified. This allowed the design of taxon-specific primer pairs to quantify the abundance of the most representative endophytic species in large naturally occurring populations of sea beet and subsequently in sugar beet breeding genotypes under either CLS symptomless or infection stages using qPCR. Among the screened bacterial genera, Methylobacterium and Mucilaginibacter were found to be significantly (p < 0.05) more abundant in symptomatic sea beets with respect to symptomless. In cultivated sugar beet material under CLS infection, the comparison between resistant and susceptible genotypes confirmed that the susceptible genotypes hosted higher contents of the above-mentioned bacterial genera. These results suggest that the abundance of these species can be correlated with increased sensitivity to CLS disease. This evidence can further prompt novel protocols to assist plant breeding of sugar beet in the pursuit of improved pathogen resistance.","Broccanello, C; Ravi, S; Deb, S; Bolton, M; Secor, G; Richards, C; Maretto, L; Della Lucia, MC; Bertoldo, G; Orsini, E; Ronquillo-Lopez, MG; Concheri, G; Campagna, G; Squartini, A; Stevanato, P",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2022,10.1038/s41598-022-14769-8,0.965364679613423,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.959283459979933,0.0407165400200669,0.999999990436448,9.5635516172976e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,cercospora beticola,cercospora beticola,5264853,Cercospora beticola,Fungi,Ascomycota,Mycosphaerellaceae,Cercospora,Cercospora beticola,ACCEPTED,Cercospora beticola,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,leaf,1,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States,0.999999990436448,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_008
9750,Gene flow in the endophyte Neotyphodium and implications for coevolution with Festuca arizonica,"Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) often harbours asymptomatic, asexual endophytic fungi from the genus Neotyphodium. In agronomic grasses, Neotyphodium endophytes are often credited with a wide range of mutualistic benefits to its host many of which are related to fungal production of alkaloids for herbivore deterrence. Neotyphodium in the native grass Arizona fescue, however, usually produces alkaloids at levels too low to deter herbivores, and in general, does not behave mutualistically. This study uses microsatellite markers to examine rates of gene flow among four Arizona populations of Neotyphodium. Haplotypic diversity was generally low; only one population contained more than two haplotypes. Haplotypes carrying multiple loci for some or all of the microsatellite loci were also found, indicating a vegetative hybridization event between Neotyphodium and the grass choke pathogen from the genus Epichloe. Gene flow between Neotyphodium populations is very low, and likely much lower than the pollen mediated gene flow of its host. These differing rates of gene flow are predicted to create trait mismatching between endophyte and host and may explain the low, or lack of, alkaloid production by Neotyphodium in Arizona fescue and other native grass species.","Sullivan, TJ; Faeth, SH",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2004,10.1046/j.1365-294X.2004.02091.x,0.988678506007003,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999981143600488,1.88563995115899e-5,0.999999989484378,1.05156220397973e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,festuca arizonica,festuca arizonica,2704972,Festuca arizonica,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Poaceae,Festuca,Festuca arizonica,ACCEPTED,Festuca arizonica,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,0.999999989484378,High (≥0.9),2,Medium (2 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_009
1362,Differences in endophyte communities of introduced trees depend on the phylogenetic relatedness of the receiving forest,"Plant species sometimes perform extraordinarily well when introduced to new environments, through achieving higher growth rates, individual biomasses or higher densities in their receiving communities compared to their native range communities. One hypothesis proposed to explain enhanced performance in species' new environments is that their soil microbial communities may be different and provide greater benefit than microbial communities encountered in species' native environments. However, detailed descriptions of soil biota associated with species in both their native and introduced environments remain scarce. We established a global network of sites in regions where the tree species Pinus contorta has been introduced (Chile, New Zealand, Finland, Scotland and Sweden), as well as native range sites where the introduced populations originated (Canada and USA). We conducted pyrosequencing analysis to compare the root fungal endophyte communities associated with P.contorta in its native environments and in introduced environments with phylogenetically similar and dissimilar tree species (i.e. P.sylvestris in Europe and Nothofagus spp. in the Southern Hemisphere). Fungal communities associated with P.contorta consistently differed between its introduced and native environments. In Europe, P.contorta associated with the same community as P.sylvestris, where one particular species (Piloderma sphaerosporum) was particularly abundant relative to Canadian sites. In the Southern Hemisphere, P.contorta fungal communities were composed primarily of North American taxa and exhibited very little overlap with fungal communities associated with native Nothofagus spp.Synthesis. Our work shows that plants exhibit considerable plasticity in their interaction with fungi, by associating with different fungal communities across native and introduced environments. Our work also indicates that fungal communities associated with introduced plants can assemble through different mechanisms, that is by associating with existing fungal communities of phylogenetically close species, or through reassembly of co-introduced and co-invading fungi. The identification of different fungal communities in a plant species new environment provides an important step forward in understanding how soil biota may impact growth and invasion when a species is introduced to new environments.","Gundale, MJ; Almeida, JP; Wallander, H; Wardle, DA; Kardol, P; Nilsson, MC; Fajardo, A; Pauchard, A; Peltzer, DA; Ruotsalainen, S; Mason, B; Rosenstock, N",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2016,10.1111/1365-2745.12595,0.878560205553843,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999972993667548,2.70063324516871e-5,0.999999988919986,1.1080014017395e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,pinus contorta,pinus contorta,5285750,Pinus contorta,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Pinaceae,Pinus,Pinus contorta,ACCEPTED,Pinus contorta,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,root,1,USA; Canada; Scotland; Sweden; Finland; New Zealand; Chile,USA; Canada; Scotland; Sweden; Finland; New Zealand,Chile,europe,NA,FALSE,USA; Canada; Scotland; Sweden; Finland; New Zealand; Chile; europe; europe,0.999999988919986,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_010
6893,"Benefits of Endophytic Fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris Inoculation for Improving Mineral Nutrition, Quality, and Yield of Rice Grains Under Low Nitrogen and Phosphorus Condition","The deficiency of N-P availability in soil is a primary cause for crop yield and nutrient loss. Since plant-beneficial microbial symbiosis is an eco-friendly method for compensating this negative effect, understanding the interconnection between endophytic fungus colonization and mineral nutrient accumulation in edible parts of crop is important in agricultural production. In this study, we focused on the effects of endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris on the absorption and distribution of 14 essential mineral elements in vegetative organs (root and shoot) and reproductive organs (grain) of rice during its growing period with reduced N-P fertilizer application, as well as the changes in yield, quality, and mineral nutrition of rice grains. The possible mechanisms including the transcriptional level of the transport-related genes and the structure of endophytic community were also investigated. The results indicated that the P. liquidambaris significantly increased the accumulation of N, P, Fe, Mn, Zn, Mo, and Se in rice grains by 20.5%, 18.9%, 18.2%, 9.5%, 17.9%, 13.3%, and 17.1%, respectively, accompanied by the significant increase in yield (23.8%) and protein content (17.3%). These beneficial effects were attributed to the enhancement formation of iron plaque, the upregulation of nutrient transporters genes, and the altered endophyte community by P. liquidambaris symbiosis. In conclusion, P. liquidambaris could promote the partition of nutrients to the grains by increasing the efficiency of nutrient uptake and remobilization. Our results suggest P. liquidambaris symbiosis as a useful candidate for improving the mineral nutrition, quality, and yield of rice grains under N-P-deficient field condition.","Tang, MJ; Lu, F; Yang, Y; Sun, K; Zhu, Q; Xu, FJ; Zhang, W; Dai, CC",JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION,2022,10.1007/s00344-021-10462-8,0.990834486170133,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99978712745991,2.1287254008957e-4,0.999999982408473,1.75915265687721e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,phomopsis liquidambaris,phomopsis liquidambaris,NA,NA,Fungi,Ascomycota,Diaporthaceae,Diaporthe,Diaporthe liquidambaris,SYNONYM,Diaporthe liquidambaris,Phomopsis liquidambaris,Diaporthe liquidambaris,species,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,root; shoot,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,0.999999982408473,High (≥0.9),1,Low (1 type),No species,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | No species,,,,,,,VAL_011

Furthermore, the presence of other groups of fungi, such as dark septate fungi (DSF), with functions supposedly analogous to those of mycorrhizal fungi, has also been reported. Th e present work provides a compilation of data regarding the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizae in plants from, or under the infl uence of, aquatic environments, and co-colonization by AMF and DSF. Forty species of non-vascular plants, ferns, fern allies, and gymnosperms from 15 families, and 659 species of angiosperms from 87 families were investigated. From the first group (non-fl owering plants) 57 % of the species showed arbuscular mycorrhizal structures in their tissues or roots, whereas among the second group (fl owering plants) 71 % had such structures. Among the mycorrhizal angiosperms, 52 % showed arbuscules in their roots. DSF were found in 1 % of non-fl owering plants and 5 % of angiosperms. All of these are discussed in this review. © 2017, Sociedade Botanica do Brasil.

11996,Marvellous Muscodor spp.: Update on Their Biology and Applications,"Nearly 20 years ago, the first report appeared on the discovery of a novel genus-Muscodor. This organism was isolated as an endophyte from a cinnamon tree that had been introduced to Honduras from Sri Lanka in the early part of the last century. Characteristically, the original Muscodor albus, and all of its species isolated since that time are non-spore producers and each one exudes a characteristic spectrum of volatile bioactive compounds. The majority have a whitish mycelium, which is sometimes coiling, intertwined and decorated with variously shaped structures. Presently, there are at least 22 type species known/documented and each has been described as an endophyte from various plant families with widely varying habitats. An enormous variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are produced by Muscodor spp. and some of these include esters, acids, aldehydes, ketones, aromatics, alkanes, alcohols, nitrosamides and terpenoids. The VOCs are both inhibitory and lethal to a wide variety of fungi and bacteria including some major pathogens of plants and humans. Interestingly, in almost all cases studied, no one compound by itself can mimic the bioactivity of the complete gas mixture, suggesting that the volatiles are acting in a synergistic manner and this has been tested with individual as well as the VOCs in various mixtures and concentrations. This review will discuss some of the recent findings in all aspects of this unique fungal genus whilst at the same time pointing out some of the major questions that remain about its biology, ecology and its applications in agriculture, medicine and other sectors. Most importantly, the authors provide arguments supporting the claim that Muscodor is taxonomically distinct from Induratia, a recently proposed change to its nomenclature.","Saxena, S; Strobel, GA",MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,2021,10.1007/s00248-020-01644-0,0.982454333008915,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996694122317385,0.00330587768261548,0.999999917293933,8.27060668839863e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,muscodor albus,muscodor albus,NA,NA,Fungi,Ascomycota,Induratiaceae,Induratia,Induratia alba,SYNONYM,Induratia alba,Muscodor albus,Induratia alba,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,NA,0,Sri Lanka,NA,Sri Lanka,NA,NA,FALSE,Sri Lanka,0.999999917293933,High (≥0.9),2,Medium (2 types),No species,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | No species,,,,,,,VAL_013
10945,Evaluation of phytotoxic potential and identification of phytotoxic compounds in Rumex maritimus,"Rumex maritimus (Polygonaceae) is an annual herb and is well known for its use in medicinal treatments. Although the pharmacological properties of R. maritimus are well documented, no phytotoxic activity of R. maritimus has yet been found. Therefore, we investigated the phytotoxic potential of R. maritimus to identify phytotoxic compounds. Inhibitory activity was found in aqueous methanol extracts of R. maritimus on the seedling growth of cress, rapeseed, barnyard grass, and foxtail fescue, in which inhibition increased with increasing extract concentration. Two compounds were isolated using chromatography, and using spectroscopy their structure was determined as 5,7-dihydroxyphthalide and altechromone A. 5,7-Dihydroxyphthalide significantly inhibited cress seedling growth by 27.2-43.0% of control seedlings at 3mM, whereas altechromone A inhibited seedling growth by 65.4-66.3% at 0.01mM. The concentrations required for 50% inhibition of cress seedling growth were 1.73-2.48mM for 5,7-dihydroxyphthalide and 0.66-1.41mM for altechromone A. These results indicate that the compounds 5,7-dihydroxyphthalide and altechromone A may contribute, to a certain extent, to the phytotoxic activity of R. maritimus.","Islam, MS; Iwasaki, A; Suenaga, K; Kato-Noguchi, H",PLANT BIOSYSTEMS,2018,10.1080/11263504.2017.1338630,0.972318831123357,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.978538897651897,0.0214611023481026,0.999999852529865,1.47470134992389e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,rumex maritimus,rumex maritimus,2888980,Rumex maritimus,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Polygonaceae,Rumex,Rumex maritimus,ACCEPTED,Rumex maritimus,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,NA,0.999999852529865,High (≥0.9),2,Medium (2 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_014

11392,Effect of fungal endophytes on plant growth and nutrient uptake in Trifolium subterraneum and Poa pratensis as affected by plant host specificity,"The introduction of well-adapted species, such as Trifolium subterraneum (subclover) and Poa pratensis (Kentucky bluegrass), might enhance the forage yield and quality of dehesa pastures for feeding livestock. However, the climatic hardness and poor soils in these agrosystems may limit plant establishment and development. Since fungal endophytes have been found to alleviate the environmental stresses of their host, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of five isolates on forage yield, nutritive value, and plant mineral uptake after their inoculation in the two abovementioned plant species. Two experiments were established (under greenhouse and field conditions) using plants inoculated with two isolates in 2012/2013 (Epicoccum nigrum, Sporormiella intermedia) and three isolates in 2013/2014 (Mucor hiemalis, Fusarium equiseti, Byssochlamys spectabilis). Fusarium equiseti (E346) increased the herbage yield of T. subterraneum under greenhouse conditions, and B. spectabilis improved the forage quality of T. subterraneum by reducing fiber content and of P. pratensis by increasing crude protein. S. intermedia increased the mineral uptake of Ca, Cu, Mn, Pb, Tl, and Zn in subclover, and M. hiemalis increased the uptake of K and Sr in Kentucky bluegrass. These results evidence the potential of the studied fungal endophytes to enhance herbage yield and nutritional value of forage, although further studies should include all of the target forage species as certain host specificity in the effect was observed.","García-Latorre, C; Rodrigo, S; Santamaria, O",MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS,2021,10.1007/s11557-021-01732-6,0.978588329811966,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.989846834932707,0.0101531650672925,0.999999687813617,3.12186382744883e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,trifolium subterraneum,trifolium subterraneum,5359330,Trifolium subterraneum,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Fabaceae,Trifolium,Trifolium subterraneum,ACCEPTED,Trifolium subterraneum,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,fiber,1,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States,0.999999687813617,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_016
1743,Predicting interactions of the frass-associated yeast Hyphopichia heimii with Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata and twig-boring bark beetles,"Bark beetles are destructive insect pests known to form symbioses with different fungal taxa, including yeasts. The aim of this study was to (1) determine the prevalence of the rare yeast Hyphopichia heimii in bark beetle frass from wild olive trees in South Africa and to (2) predict the potential interaction of this yeast with trees and bark beetles. Twenty-eight culturable yeast species were isolated from frass in 35 bark beetle galleries, including representatives of H. heimii from nine samples. Physiological characterization of H. heimii isolates revealed that none was able to degrade complex polymers present in hemicellulose; however, all were able to assimilate sucrose and cellobiose, sugars associated with an arboreal habitat. All isolates were able to produce the auxin indole acetic acid, indicative of a potential symbiosis with the tree. Sterol analysis revealed that the isolates possessed ergosterol quantities ranging from 3.644 +/- 0.119 to 13.920 +/- 1.230 mg/g dry cell weight, which suggested that H. heimii could serve as a source of sterols in bark beetle diets, as is known for other bark beetle-associated fungi. In addition, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated that at least one of the isolates, Hyphopichia heimii CAB 1614, was able to convert the insect pheromone cis-verbenol to the anti-aggregation pheromone verbenone. This indicated that H. heimii could potentially influence beetle behaviour. These results support the contention of a tripartite symbiosis between H. heimii, olive trees, and bark beetles.","Asmus, JJ; Toplis, B; Roets, F; Botha, A",FOLIA MICROBIOLOGICA,2022,10.1007/s12223-022-00985-2,0.97307616090315,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985755730389218,0.0142442696107817,0.999999481032678,5.18967321561092e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,hyphopichia heimii,hyphopichia heimii,3305171,Hyphopichia heimii,Fungi,Ascomycota,Debaryomycetaceae,Hyphopichia,Hyphopichia heimii,ACCEPTED,Hyphopichia heimii,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,bark,1,South Africa,NA,South Africa,africa,NA,FALSE,South Africa; africa,0.999999481032678,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_017

However, the relationship between floral volatiles and plant endophytic fungi has not received much research attention. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing technology to compare and analyze the changes in the structure and diversity of the endophytic fungal communities in C. praecox under different circadian rhythms (7:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., and 7:00 p.m.) and in different blooming stages (unopened flowers and opened flowers). The endophytic fungi of C. praecox consisted of nine phyla, 34 classes, 79 orders, 181 families, 293 genera, and 397 species, and Ascomycota was the dominant phylum. Under a diurnal rhythm, the diversity (Chao1 and Shannon indices) of endophytic fungi gradually decreased in the unopened flowers, while an increasing and then decreasing trend was found for the opened flowers. In the different blooming stages, the endophytic fungal diversity was significantly higher at 7:00 a.m. in the unopened flowers compared to the opened flowers. Humidity was the key factors that significantly affected the endophytic fungal diversity and community. Moreover, 11 endophytic fungi were significantly positively or negatively correlated with seven floral volatiles. In conclusion, the community structure and diversity of endophytic fungi in C. praecox were affected by the different blooming stages and circadian rhythms, and a correlation effect related to floral volatiles was found, but there are other possible reasons that were not tested. This study provides a theoretical basis for elucidating the interrelationships between endophytic fungi, floral volatiles, and environmental factors in C. praecox.","Li, Y; Hei, JY; He, XH; Rui, R; Wang, S",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2024,10.3390/jof10020145,0.963387320288656,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999913687173071,8.63128269290676e-5,0.999999451838385,5.48161614655207e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,chimonanthus praecox,chimonanthus praecox,7275851,Chimonanthus praecox,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Calycanthaceae,Chimonanthus,Chimonanthus praecox,ACCEPTED,Chimonanthus praecox,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,molecular,flowers,1,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States,0.999999451838385,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_018
10151,"Palatability, digestibility and intake of endophyte free and infected tall fescue hay.","This paper aims to clarify the potential effect of the endophytic fungus, Acremonium coenophialum, on the feeding value of tall fescue hay under climatic conditions and usual management in France. Two batches of hay were harvested from two fields sown with seeds of the same variety either totally infested (E+) or free (E-) of endophyte. Presence of the endophyte had no effect on the chemical composition or in vitro digestibility in hay nor on the dry matter in situ degradation kinetic assessed following the nylon bag procedure. In vivo digestibility of both hays, assessed on sheep in individual crates, was quite similar (E+: 57.0%; E-: 57.9%). However, the E- hay was clearly preferred by sheep during the palatability test (53.1 vs 15.7% rate of consumption) and was more ingested (54.7 vs 50.1 g/kg animal metabolic weight). The results showed, therefore, that the endophyte can induce some negative effects on palatability and volontary intake of tall fescue but without altering the potential digestibility of infested hay. Regarding further investigations on the effect of infested grass forages on animal productions, it appears that emphasis should be on the level of toxicity rather than on feeding value.","Emile, JC; Ghesquiere, M; Traineau, R",ANNALES DE ZOOTECHNIE,1996,10.1051/animres:19960502,0.9575855216455,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999998795774291,1.20422570876698e-6,0.999993509580697,6.49041930345096e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,acremonium coenophialum,acremonium coenophialum,NA,NA,Fungi,Ascomycota,Clavicipitaceae,Epichloe,Epichloe coenophiala,SYNONYM,Epichloe coenophiala,Acremonium coenophialum,Epichloe coenophiala,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,seeds,1,France,France,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,France,0.999998795774291,High (≥0.9),2,Medium (2 types),No species,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | No species,,,,,,,VAL_019
15691,Endophytic fungi as biological control agents and their indirect effects on plants; [Endofitne glive v biotičnem varstvu rastlin pred škodljivimi organizmi in njihov posreden vpliv na rastline],"The use of entomopathogenic fungi represents one of the most important non-chemical alternatives for pest control in crop production. In addition to their pathogenicity to arthropods, they have many other important effects that favor their use in biological control. They live in plants as endophytes and have an inhibitory effect on plant pathogens. They inhabit the rhizosphere of many plants in natural and agricultural ecosystems and have a stimulatory effect on their growth and development. These recently acquired ecological functions are not yet fully understood, but point to the broader potential of using entomopathogenic endophytic fungi in crop production, not only as biopesticides but also as mycofungicides and growth stimulants (biostimulants). To achieve the full potential of entomopathogenic endophytic fungi in daily agricultural practice, practical application should be considered in the development of commercial products and the application techniques of entomopathogenic endophytic fungi that allow successful colonization of plants should be considered. © 2021 University of Ljubljana.

5693,"Streptomyces typhae sp. nov., a novel endophytic actinomycete with antifungal activity isolated the root of cattail (Typha angustifolia L.)","A novel endophytic actinomycete with antagonistic activity against various phytopathogenic fungi, designated strain p1417(T), was isolated from the root of cattail (Typha angustifolia L.) collected from Yunnan Province, Southwest China. A polyphasic taxonomic study was carried out to establish the taxonomic status of this strain. Strain p1417(T) was found to have morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics typical of the genus Streptomyces. The diamino acid present in the cell wall was LL-diaminopimelic acid. Xylose and arabinose occurred in whole cell hydrolysates. The menaquinones were identified as MK-9(H-8), MK-9(H-6) and MK-9(H-4). The polar lipid profile was found to contain diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol mannoside. The major fatty acids were found to be iso-C-16:0, anteiso-C(15:0,)iso-C-15:0 and C-16:0. The genomic DNA G + C content of strain p1417(T) based on the genome sequence was 72.0 mol%. Based on 16 S rRNA gene, five housekeeping genes and whole genome sequences analysis, strain p1417(T) was most closely related to Streptomyces flavofungini JCM 4753(T) (99.4% 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Streptomyces alboflavus JCM 4615(T) (98.8%) and Streptomyces aureoverticillatus JCM 4347(T) (98.2%). However, the average nucleotide identity values, the digital DNA-DNA hybridization values and the multilocus sequence analysis evolutionary distances between this strain and its closely related strains showed that it belonged to one distinct species. In addition, these results were also supported by differences in the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics between strain p1417(T) and three closely related type strains. Therefore, it is concluded that strain p1417(T) represents a novel species of the genus of Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces typhae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is p1417(T) (= CCTCC AA 2019091(T) = DSM 110636(T)).","Peng, CH; Zhuang, XX; Gao, CT; Wang, ZY; Zhao, JW; Huang, SX; Liu, CX; Xiang, WS",ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY,2021,10.1007/s10482-021-01561-3,0.99094883242058,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991887473011034,0.00811252698896594,0.999994104668717,5.89533128292352e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,typha angustifolia,typha angustifolia,5289461,Typha angustifolia,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Typhaceae,Typha,Typha angustifolia,ACCEPTED,Typha angustifolia,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,root; cell wall,2,China,NA,China,NA,polar,FALSE,China; polar,0.999994104668717,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_021
13324,Synergistic effect of fungicides on the incidence of seed mycoflora of okra,"Seeds of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) Moench) variety Arka anamika were treated with 5 fungicides including Anucop, Bavistin, Captan, Dithane M-45 and Vitavax with different doses (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3%) and the combination Anucop + Bavistin, Anucop + Captan, Anucop + Vitavax, Bavistin + Vitavax, Anucop + Dithane, Bavistin + Dithane, Bavistin + Captan, Captan + Vitavax, Anucop + Bavistin + Captan, Anucop + Bavistin + Dithane, Anucop + Captan + Vitavax, Bavistin + Captan + Vitavax were used to test their potency against the seed-borne fungal diseases. Among these, Anucop at a concentration of 0.3%, Bavistin @ 0.2%, Captan @ 0.3%, Dithane @ 0.3%, Vitavax @ 0.3% and their combinations, like Anucop + Bavistin, Anucop + Dithane, Bavistin + Dithane, Anucop + Captan + Vitavax, Bavistin + Captan + Vitavax were most effective in the improvement of crop both in greenhouse and field conditions. These chemicals at different doses and in combinations increased the total number of leaves, fruits, mean length, girth and biomass of fruits. Apart from these, the total number of seeds per fruit, seed density and weight and ascorbic acid content were also enhanced. These chemicals reduced the incidence of seed mycoflora, thereby enhancing the seed germination percentage and vigour index of the seedlings. © 2008 Asian Network for Scientific Information.",Begum M.; Lokesh S.,International Journal of Botany,2008,10.3923/ijb.2008.24.32,0.932537823645831,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99872998360785,0.00127001639215035,0.999992405375856,7.59462414434697e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,abelmoschus esculentus,abelmoschus esculentus,3152707,Abelmoschus esculentus,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Malvaceae,Abelmoschus,Abelmoschus esculentus,ACCEPTED,Abelmoschus esculentus,NA,NA,species,NA,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,seeds; seed; leaves; fruits; fruit,5,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,United States,0.999992405375856,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_022
18697,Genomics of plant-associated fungi: Research progress and highlights in forage crops.,"Plant-associated fungi are fungal groups that exhibit different interactions with plants such as symbiosis (mycorrhizae), antagonistic (pathogenic) and beneficial (biocontrol), and commensal relationships. Since the publication of the first fungal genome sequence of the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe grisea in 2005, a new chapter in the genome exploration of plant-associated fungi has been initiated. Research in past decades showed about 1385 sequenced fungal genomes associated with plants. These genomes are linked with grain crops (e.g., wheat, rice), cash crops (e.g., soybean, cotton), and forage crops (e.g., alfalfa). The reported functional groups associated with plants include pathogens, endophytes, mycorrhizal fungi and saprotrophs. For the categories of plant-associated fungi based on functional groups, pathogenic fungi were the dominant group with a distribution of 96 %, followed by endophytes (2 %) and other fungi with unclear roles (2 %). For the categories of plant-associated fungi based on crop host, only 3.5 % of sequenced genomes is associated with forage crops compared with 67 % for food and cash crops. Based on the number of sequenced genomes, Fusarium belongs to the top one ranked fungal genus with wheat as the top one ranked crop host.

8535,Alkaloid Contents in Epichloe Endophyte-Infected Elymus tangutorum Sampled along an Elevation Gradient on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau,"Alkaloids produced by endophytic fungi can have an important influence on agricultural ecology, and can often be affected by climatic factors. At present, there are no studies that have assessed the relationship between alkaloid production and elevation or climatic factors in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. To address this knowledge gap, we explored ergot alkaloid and peramine production in Epichloe-infected (E+) Elymus tangutorum collected from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau and assessed the relationship between the concentration of these alkaloids and elevation. The effects of temperature and precipitation on these relationships were also investigated. The concentrations of ergonovine, ergine, and peramine ranged from 0.47-0.84, 0.35-1.72 and 9.18-13.00 mu g center dot g(-1), respectively. Fitted cubic regression curves describing an arc-pattern across the elevational series were statistically significant for ergine and peramine concentrations. The elevational trend in peramine concentration was linked to mean daily temperature, while the ergine elevational trend was linked to mean precipitation. Our results provide a new understanding of the climatic factors that influence the alkaloid production of endophytic fungi at different elevations in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.","Shi, Q; Matthew, C; Liu, WH; Nan, ZB",AGRONOMY-BASEL,2020,10.3390/agronomy10111812,0.9407396790121,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.982953372146221,0.017046627853779,0.9999768657118,2.31342881996666e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,elymus tangutorum,elymus tangutorum,NA,NA,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Poaceae,Elymus,Elymus dahuricus,SYNONYM,Elymus dahuricus,Elymus tangutorum,Elymus dahuricus,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,NA,0,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,United States,0.9999768657118,High (≥0.9),2,Medium (2 types),No species,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | No species,,,,,,,VAL_024
13141,Laboratory evaluation of grain protectant efficacy of different foliar extracts against maize weevil - Sitophilus zeamais (Motschulsky),"The present study was aimed to evaluate six indigenous plant extracts for their ability to protect maize from infestation by maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais (M). The plant extracts were tested for its toxicity by fumigation and grain surface coating methods. Further, the effects of botanical treatments on F1 progeny, seed emergence and antifungal activities were studied. The results indicated that the extracts of Eicchornia crassipes controlled the test insect in grain surface coating method (100%, P = 0.05). Further, the same plant extract had significantly reduced the development of F1 progeny (97 ± 0.7%). In germination experiments, T + UEx samples showed normal seed germination of maize. However, in T + Ex samples, the seed germination depended on the grain protectant efficacy of the tested botanical extracts. Always higher percantage seed germination was recorded in those treatments where there was less infestation. Extracts of Carica papaya had significantly reduced the incidence of seed-borne fungus Aspergillus flavus (4 ± 2.4%) and did not affect the seed germination when compared to other treatments and untreated control. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Chakradhar D.; Narendra A.; Nagaraju K.,Archives of Phytopathology and Plant Protection,2010,10.1080/03235400902753758,0.971096978326861,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.973651157164911,0.0263488428350895,0.999974811178325,2.51888216751261e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,carica papaya,carica papaya,2874484,Carica papaya,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Caricaceae,Carica,Carica papaya,ACCEPTED,Carica papaya,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,seed,1,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States,0.999974811178325,High (≥0.9),3,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_025
17754,Protection to Tomato Wilt Disease Conferred by the Nonpathogen Fusarium oxysporum Fo47 is More Effective Than that Conferred by Avirulent Strains.,"Although the vascular pathogen Fusarium oxysporum is notorious for being the causal agent of Fusarium wilt disease, the vast majority of F. oxysporum strains are harmless soil and root colonizers. The latter F. oxysporum's are often endophytes colonizing roots intracellularly without negatively affecting plant fitness. Actually, most of them, like Fo47, are beneficial providing biological control to various root pathogens. Interestingly, also pathogenic F. oxysporum inoculated on a resistant host (i.e., avirulent F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici) can reduce susceptibility to virulent F. oxysporum strains via a mechanism called ""cross protection."" It has been hypothesized that cross protection is based on activation of a resistance protein of the host upon recognition of a cognate avirulence (Avr) protein of the pathogen. Currently, it is unknown whether the biocontrol activity of F. oxysporum endophytes utilizes similar mechanisms as cross protection conferred by avirulent pathogens, and whether both provide a quantitative similar level of protection. Here, we show that in tomato biocontrol activity of the Fo47 endophyte to the pathogen F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici is more effective than cross protection induced by avirulent F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici strains activating either I, I-2, or both resistance proteins upon recognition of Avr1 or the Avr2/Six5 pair, respectively. These findings imply that cross protection and biological control utilize different mechanisms to reduce susceptibility of the host to subsequent infections.",de Lamo FJ; Spijkers SB; Takken FLW,Phytopathology,2021,10.1094/PHYTO-04-20-0133-R,0.70300407784713,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.755428506911511,0.244571493088489,0.999965718785546,3.4281214454257e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,fusarium oxysporum,fusarium oxysporum,5251961,Fusarium oxysporum,Fungi,Ascomycota,Nectriaceae,Fusarium,Fusarium oxysporum,ACCEPTED,Fusarium oxysporum,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,root; roots,2,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States,0.999965718785546,High (≥0.9),3,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_026
20936,"Endophytic fungi in Quercus cerris: Isolation frequency in relation to phenological phase, tree health and the organ affected","The isolation frequency of endophytic fungi in Quercus cerris was determined in relation to sampling data, the health state of the tree, and the tree organ affected. Sampling was carried out at three times, in April (budbreak), June (full vegetation) and October (leaf fall), on trees that were either healthy or in decline, and on three organs: current-year twigs, with a diameter less than 2 cm, buds, and leaves. The experiment was done in an approximately 20-year-old oak forest at an altitude of 350-400 m above sea level. Three healthy and three declining trees were sampled annually in 1999 and 2000. From each tree 20 current-year twigs, 20 buds and 10 leaves were harvested. Tissue fragments, after sterilization with 10% H2O2, were incubated on potato-dextrose-agar amended with streptomycin, at 20°C in the dark for 7 days, and the isolated mycelia maintained at 4°C on malt-extract agar. A total of 15 fungal species were isolated. All organs yielded fungal species but the greatest number of endophytic species came from current year twigs. Individual species were isolated more often from declining trees than from healthy trees, and more fungi were isolated in June (full vegetation) than in April or October. Diplodia mutila, Discula quercina and Phomopsis quercina, which are known to be pathogenetic on oaks, were present on oaks for a large part of the year. These fungi are both saprophytes (as endophytes) and parasites and are, therefore, probably a serious contributing and inciting factor in the oak decline syndrome.",Ragazzi A.; Moricca S.; Capretti P.; Dellavalle I.; Mancini F.; Turco E.,Phytopathologia Mediterranea,2001,NA,0.924221447328306,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.701264668376183,0.298735331623817,0.999962813022315,3.71869776848444e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain,quercus cerris,quercus cerris,2880580,Quercus cerris,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Fagaceae,Quercus,Quercus cerris,ACCEPTED,Quercus cerris,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,leaf; twigs; buds; leaves,4,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States,0.999962813022315,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_027

7029,Molecular and morphological markers for rapid distinction between 2 Colletotrichum species,"Endophytic microorganisms reside asymptomatically within plants and are a source of new bioactive products for use in medicine, agriculture, and industry. Colletotrichum (teleomorph Glomerella) is a fungus widely cited in the literature as a producer of antimicrobial substances. Identification at the species level, however, has been a problem in this type of study. Several authors have reported the presence of endophytic fungi from the medicinal plant Maytenus ilicifolia (""espinheira-santa"") in Brazil that has antimicrobial activity against various pathogens. Therefore, Colletotrichum strains were isolated from M. ilicifolia and identified based on morphology, RAPD markers, sequence data of the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS-1 and ITS-2), the 5.8S gene, and species-specific PCR. The analyses suggested the presence of 2 species, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Colletotrichum boninense. Two morphological markers were characterized to allow C. gloeosporioides and C. boninense to be distinguished quickly and accurately. The molecular diagnosis of C. boninense was confirmed by using Coll and ITS4 primers. This species of Colletotrichum is reported for the first time in M. ilicifolia.","Pileggi, SAV; de Oliveira, SFV; Andrade, CW; Vicente, VA; Dalzoto, PD; da Cruz, GK; Gabardo, J; Massola, NS; Tozze, HJ; Pileggi, M; Kava-Cordeiro, V; Galli-Terasawa, LV; Pimentel, IC; Stringari, D; Glienke, C",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY,2009,10.1139/W09-059,0.980021742426221,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.755747831944174,0.244252168055826,0.999785747131911,2.1425286808929e-4,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain,colletotrichum gloeosporioides,colletotrichum gloeosporioides,2569005,Colletotrichum gloeosporioides,Fungi,Ascomycota,Glomerellaceae,Colletotrichum,Colletotrichum gloeosporioides,ACCEPTED,Colletotrichum gloeosporioides,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,NA,0,Brazil,NA,Brazil,NA,NA,FALSE,Brazil,0.999785747131911,High (≥0.9),3,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_030

20618,Histological investigations of healthy tissues of Catharanthus roseus to localize fungal endophytes,"Catharanthus roseus is an important medicinal plant known for its potential therapeutic terpenoid indole alkaloids. The aerial and underground parts of the plant are transcriptionally distinct and known to produce distinct spectrum of terpenoid indole alkaloids. Production of a plant-based natural drug is not always up to the desired level. Considering the limitations associated with the productivity, microorganisms serve as the ultimate and inexhaustible source of novel structures bearing pharmaceutical potential. Endophytes, the microorganisms residing inside the healthy tissues of the host plant are relatively unstudied and offer potential sources of novel natural products for exploitation in medicine, agriculture and the pharmaceutical industry. The present study was carried out to examine the localization and distribution of endophytic fungi present inside the healthy plants tissues of C. roseus (purple and white) variety. The endophytic fungi were detected by incubating the sterilized explants of C. roseus in PDA plates to promote the growth of mycelia. To locate the distribution, fungal endophytes were stained with Lactophenol cotton blue. Dense fungal colony and hyphae were observed in the xylem, phloem, and pith region of both leaf and stem tissues. Dense colonies of endophytes were also observed in cortex of root tissue. Rich localization was observed for C. roseus white variety in leaf and stem tissues.

Among the roostocks investigated in this study, 1103P and 101-14 MG were less susceptible to the infection caused by P chlamydospora and P aleophillum.","Díaz, GA; Esterio, M; Auger, J",CIENCIA E INVESTIGACION AGRARIA,2009,NA,0.92136245819716,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Absence,0.217712372385329,0.782287627614671,0.999472430467508,5.2756953249233e-4,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain,phaeoacremonium aleophilum,phaeoacremonium aleophilum,NA,NA,Fungi,Ascomycota,Togniniaceae,Phaeoacremonium,Phaeoacremonium minimum,SYNONYM,Phaeoacremonium minimum,Phaeoacremonium aleophilum,Phaeoacremonium minimum,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,0.999472430467508,High (≥0.9),1,Low (1 type),No species,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | No species,,,,,,,VAL_035
3819,Assessing Genotypic and Environmental Effects on Endophyte Communities of Fraxinus (Ash) Using Culture Dependent and Independent DNA Sequencing,"Fraxinus excelsior populations are in decline due to the ash dieback disease Hymenoscyphus fraxineus. It is important to understand genotypic and environmental effects on its fungal microbiome to develop disease management strategies. To do this, we used culture dependent and culture independent approaches to characterize endophyte material from contrasting ash provenances, environments, and tissues (leaves, roots, seeds). Endophytes were isolated and identified using nrITS, LSU, or tef DNA loci in the culture dependent assessments, which were mostly Ascomycota and assigned to 37 families. Few taxa were shared between roots and leaves. The culture independent approach used high throughput sequencing (HTS) of nrITS amplicons directly from plant DNA and detected 35 families. Large differences were found in OTU diversity and community composition estimated by the contrasting approaches and these data need to be combined for estimations of the core endophyte communities. Species richness and Shannon index values were highest for the leaf material and the French population. Few species were shared between seed and leaf tissue. PCoA and NMDS of the HTS data showed that seed and leaf microbiome communities were highly distinct and that there was a strong influence of Fraxinus species identity on their fungal community composition. The results will facilitate a better understanding of ash fungal ecology and are a step toward identifying microbial biocontrol systems to minimize the impact of the disease.","Lahiri, A; Murphy, BR; Hodkinson, TR",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2021,10.3390/jof7070565,0.992037475918278,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.902005000348717,0.0979949996512831,0.999279911885555,7.2008811444479e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,fraxinus excelsior,fraxinus excelsior,3172358,Fraxinus excelsior,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Oleaceae,Fraxinus,Fraxinus excelsior,ACCEPTED,Fraxinus excelsior,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,leaves; roots; seeds; leaf; seed,5,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States,0.999279911885555,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_036
21409,[Isolation and biodiversity of heavy metal tolerant endophytic bacteria from halotolerant plant species located in coastal shoal of Nantong].,"We isolated and identified endophytic bacteria from halotolerant plants collected from coastal shoal of Nantong and investigated their heavy-metal tolerance and plant growth promoting potential. In total 45 strains were obtained from 4 halotolerant plants and 23 representative isolates were selected to detect their tolerance against NaCl and heavy metals of Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Hg2+; plant growth promoting index of nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, indoleacetic acid (IAA) production and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase. Most of the isolates could grow under high consistency of Cu2+ and Pb2+. Of the bacteria 26.1% had the ability of nitrogen fixation, 21.7% of phosphate solubilization, 60.9% of IAA production and 39.1% of ACC deaminase activity. The results of 16S rRNA sequencing show that they belonged to the genera of Bacillus, Halobacillus, Oceanobacillus, Exiguobacterium, Serratia, Brevundimonas, Vibrio and Staphylococcus. Among them, strains KLBMP 2432 and KLBMP 2447 were potential novel species. The halotolerant plants located in the area of coastal shoal contain a variety of endophytic bacteria as well as the source of novel taxa. Some of them had the ability of plant growth promoting and high resistance against heavy-metal Cu2+ and Pb2+.",Bian G; Zhang Y; Qin S; Xing K; Xie H; Jiang J,Wei sheng wu xue bao = Acta microbiologica Sinica,2011,NA,0.923624157005933,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Absence,Absence,0.0659635848641636,0.934036415135836,0.996841716681493,0.00315828331850676,Absence,Absence,Absence,Absence,Absence,Absence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NO_MATCH,NA,NA,NA,none,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,molecular; culture; microscopy,NA,0,United States,United States,NA,NA,coastal,FALSE,United States; coastal; coastal,0.996841716681493,High (≥0.9),2,Medium (2 types),No species,Absence,Absence | High (≥0.9) | No species,,,,,,,VAL_037
