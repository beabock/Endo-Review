As yet, plant-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere remain largely mysterious. In this study, rhizosphere fungal community structure was first studied in a field experiment with two soybean cultivars contrasting in nodulation grown in two rhizobium inoculation treatments. Following this, recombinant inbred lines (RILs) contrasting in markers across three QTLs for biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) were evaluated for effects of genotype and rhizobium inoculation to the rhizosphere fungal community as assessed using ITS1 amplicon sequencing. The soybean plants tested herein not only hosted rhizosphere fungal communities that were distinct from bulk soils, but also specifically recruited and enriched Cladosporium from bulk soils. The resulting rhizosphere fungal communities varied among soybean genotypes, as well as, between rhizobium inoculation treatments. Besides, Cladosporium were mostly enriched in the rhizospheres of soybean genotypes carrying two or three favorable BNF QTLs, suggesting a close association between soybean traits associated with nodulation and those affecting the rhizosphere fungal community. This inference was bolstered by the observation that introduction of exogenous rhizobia significantly altered rhizosphere fungal communities to the point that these communities could be distinguished based on the combination of soybean genotype and whether exogenous rhizobia was applied. Interestingly, grouping of host plants by BNF QTLs also distinguished fungal community responses to rhizobium inoculation. Taken together, these results reveal that complex cross-kingdom interactions exist among host plants, symbiotic N-2 fixing bacteria and fungal communities in the soybean rhizosphere.",Rhizobium Inoculation Drives the Shifting of Rhizosphere Fungal Community in a Host Genotype Dependent Manner,"Xu, HY; Yang, YQ; Tian, YZ; Xu, RN; Zhong, YJ; Liao, H",3706,10.3389/fmicb.2019.03135,2020,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,Presence,1,High (≥0.9),0.986713232,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999799117,2.01E-04,1,1.11E-16,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9)

To examine the effects of stromatal development on the host, R. kamoji plants harboring E. yangzii were collected from Jiangpu, Nanjing. Differences between stromatal plants and non-stromatal plants in terms of tillering and flowering of the plants, diameter and length of the culms, number and length of the leaves, and senescence of both leaves and culms were investigated from 2010 to 2012. Results indicate that stromal development of E. yangzii promoted the flag leaf growth of stromatal culms, enhanced thousand-seed weight of non-stromatal culms, delayed leaf and culm senescence of both stromatal and non-stromatal culms, but decreased tiller number and inhibited the emergence of inflorescence of the stromatal culms. The overgrowth of fungal hyphae blocked the emergence path and resulted in failure of the emergence of inflorescence of stromatal culms. The decrease in tiller number indicates that influences of stroma occur before plant vernalization, although stromata develop at the early stage of emergence of flag leaf sheath or inflorescence. The delay in leaf and culm senescence on the whole plants indicates signals caused by stromatal development, which can also be transferred to the non-stromatal tillers of the same plant.

This study aimed to explore the role of DSE fungus S16 in improving drought tolerance in sweet cherry seedlings and to reveal the underlying molecular and microbial mechanisms through a multi-omics approach. Physiological analysis showed that S16 inoculation improved plant growth, increased relative water content, photosynthetic rate, and antioxidant enzyme activities, while reducing ion leakage and oxidative damage under drought conditions. Metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses identified key metabolic pathways, particularly flavonoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, as being significantly activated, with upregulation of genes such as PAL, 4CL and CHS, and increased accumulation of metabolites like cinnamic acid (CA) and flavonoid derivatives. Exogenous application of CA at 0.5 mM further enhanced drought resistance by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, increasing proline accumulation, and boosting antioxidant enzyme activities. Rhizosphere microbiota analysis revealed that S16 symbiosis and CA treatment under drought conditions increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as members of Sphingomonas, Stenotrophobacter and Parcubacteria, while promoting the dominance of Humicola and Fusarium fungi.

Host and ecological role shifts were inferred by phylogenetic analyses and ancestral character reconstructions. The results support several interkingdom host jumps and also show that the preference for a particular habitat was gained or lost multiple times. Diversification analysis revealed that mycoparasitism is associated with accelerated speciation rates, which then suggests that this trait may be linked to the high number of species in Trichoderma. In this study it was also possible to infer the cryptic roles that endophytes or soil inhabitants play in their hosts by evaluating their closest relatives and determining their most recent ancestors.

Out of 36 endophytic fungi segregated from symptomless roots of apple, wheat, maize, marigold, cherry, and garlic plants, only 9 isolates showed inhibitory effect during preliminary screening and were further assayed under in vitro, pot, and field conditions against the white root rot pathogen/disease. Under in vitro conditions, maximum mycelial inhibition of 81.48% was obtained with the isolate Aspergillus aculeatus strain C2. Microscopic studies on interaction between fungal endophyte with hyphal tips of D. necatrix revealed various morphological abnormalities in the hyphae. In glasshouse conditions, seed treatment pursued by soil application with Crinipellis tabtim strain M8 isolate was highly effective and exhibited 93.55% disease control. Similarly, under field conditions, the overall maximum disease control was exhibited by Crinipellis tabtim strain M8 (84.95%).

Research has identified a wide range of endophytic microorganisms, including fungi, bacteria, viruses, and yeasts, across different Vitis vinifera cultivars and Vitis species. Microbial diversity may provide plants with survival advantages or contribute to susceptibility to plant pathogens, though further research is needed to confirm these hypotheses. Microbial fertilizers are emerging as alternatives to conventional chemicals, offering the potential for increased crop productivity and environmental sustainability.

Endophytic microorganism-based biological control, especially using microorganisms from host plants, has emerged as a promising and eco-friendly approach for managing plant diseases. Therefore, this study aimed to isolate, identify and characterize the endophytic fungi from healthy potato leaves which had great antifungal activity to the potato leaf spot pathogen of A. alternata in vitro and in vivo. Results An endophytic fungal strain SD1-4 was isolated from healthy potato leaves and was identified as Talaromyces muroii through morphological and sequencing analysis. The strain SD1-4 exhibited potent antifungal activity against the potato leaf spot pathogen A. alternata Lill, with a hyphal inhibition rate of 69.19%. Microscopic and scanning electron microscope observations revealed that the strain SD1-4 grew parallel to, coiled around, shrunk and deformed the mycelia of A. alternata Lill. Additionally, the enzyme activities of chitinase and beta-1, 3-glucanase significantly increased in the hyphae of A. alternata Lill when co-cultured with the strain SD1-4, indicating severe impairment of the cell wall function of A. alternata Lill. Furthermore, the mycelial growth and conidial germination of A. alternata Lill were significantly suppressed by the aseptic filtrate of the strain SD1-4, with inhibition rates of 79.00% and 80.67%, respectively.

However, their relationship with plants ranges from beneficial to harmful and has remained largely uncharacterized. In the present study, 14 DSE species grouped into 11 genera were isolated from the roots of a desert plant, Artemisia ordosica, which is widely distributed in northwest China. Three dominant DSE species-Paraphoma chrysanthemicola (Pc), Alternaria chartarum (Ac), and Acrocalymma vagum (Av)-were selected and tested for their resistance to drought in vitro. Furthermore, we characterized the responses of A. ordosica under drought conditions in relation to the presence of these DSEs following inoculation. The results showed that all three strains grew well under in vitro drought stress, and the biomass of Ac and Av was significantly higher than that of the unstressed control. The effects of DSE inoculation on the growth of A. ordosica under drought stress varied according to the different DSE species but were generally beneficial. Under drought stress, Av and Pc promoted plant growth, antioxidant enzyme activity, and root development of the hosts.

Tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.) Dumort.), an exotic grass covering millions of acres in the United States, can host a fungal endophyte, Epichloe coenophiala (Morgan-Jones & Gams). Alkaloids produced by the endophyte are known to be toxic to some foliar-feeding pest insects. Endophyte-infected tall fescue is commonly planted in hayfields, pastures, lawns, and is invading natural areas, but effects of the endophyte on nonpest insects such as butterflies are relatively unknown. Our objective was to investigate the role that tall fescue and its endophyte might play in the decline of grass skippers (Hesperiidae). We examined growth and survival parameters of tawny-edged skippers (Polites themistocles (Latreille)) that were reared on endophyte-infected tall fescue (E+), endophyte-free tall fescue (E-), and Kentucky bluegrass (KBG). KBG was included as a comparison because it is a cool season grass known to be palatable to P. themistocles larvae. Interestingly, results showed that the endophyte did not affect growth and survival of larvae compared to uninfected tall fescue, even though significant amounts of loline alkaloids (average 740 ppm) were measured in endophyte-infected plant material. Larvae feeding on KBG grew faster with greater survival rates than larvae on both tall fescue treatments.

Methods and ResultsA library of 190 bacterial endophytes from wild, ancient and modern Zea plants were tested for their ability to suppress S.homoeocarpa invitro, followed by in planta testing of candidates using greenhouse trials. Three endophytes could suppress S.homoeocarpa, originating from wild maize and an ancient Mexican landrace, consistent with our hypothesis. 16S phylogenetic analysis and BOX-PCR DNA fingerprinting suggest that the anti-fungal endophytes are distinct strains of Burkholderia gladioli. One strain (3A12) was confirmed to colonize creeping bentgrass using green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagging. Evans blue vitality staining demonstrated that the bacterial endophytes exhibited fungicidal activities against the pathogen. The endophytes inhibited a wide spectrum of plant-associated fungi including diverse crop pathogens.

The effectiveness of the alternating treatments with an appropriate systemic fungicide and 1% solution of MKP was similar to that of the commercial treatment with the systemic fungicides alone. However, application of the systemic fungicides only, omitting the phosphate treatment when they were scheduled, was significantly less effective than either the phosphate or the alternation treatments. These results indicate that the use of phosphate fertilizer has a significant role in disease control, enabling up to 50% reduction with number of fungicide treatments required for powdery mildew control. These results were confirmed in a large-scale demonstration trial conducted in a commercial orchard in 1995. This trial also revealed that a tank-mix treatment of 1% MKP solution with an SI fungicide provided the best protection against powdery mildew. Phosphate solutions were not phytotoxic to plants.

Celery petioles were incubated in humid chambers (acrylic boxes with wet paper towels). After 24 h, conidia corresponding to the genus Colletotrichum were observed. Isolations were performed by excising pieces of celery tissue from the lesion margin and placing them on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with 30 ppm of rifampicin and 100 ppm of ampicillin. Plates were incubated at 21 ± 2°C under fluorescent light for 5 days.

These indole-diterpenes confer major ecological benefits on the grass-endophyte symbiotum. A molecular signature for diterpene biosynthesis is the presence of two geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) synthases. Using degenerate primers for conserved domains of fungal GGPP synthases, we cloned two such genes, ltmG and ggsA, from Neotyphodium lolii. Adjacent to ltmG are two genes, ltmM and ltmK, that are predicted to encode an FAD-dependent monooxygenase and a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, respectively. The cluster of ltm genes is flanked by AT-rich retrotransposon DNA that appears to have undergone extensive repeat induced point (RIP) mutation. Epichloe festucae, the sexual ancestor of N. lolii, contains an identical ltm gene cluster, but lacks the retrotransposon ""platform"" on the right flank. Associations established between perennial ryegrass and an E. festucae mutant deleted for ltmM lack detectable levels of lolitrems. A wild-type copy of ltmM complemented this phenotype, as did paxM from Penicillium paxilli. Northern hybridization and RT-PCR analysis showed that all three genes are weakly expressed in culture but strongly induced in planta. The relative endophyte biomass in these associations was estimated by real-time PCR to be between 0.3 and 1.9%. Taking this difference into account, the steady-state levels of the ltm transcripts are about 100-fold greater than the levels of the endogenous ryegrass beta-tubulin (beta -Tub1) and actin (Act1) RNAs.

Pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) is a key enzyme in aroma, initiating the conversion of pyruvate into acetaldehyde. This process produces precursors for esters and aromatic compounds that enhance strawberry aroma. Additionally, alcohol acyltransferases (AATs) are essential for catalyzing acyl group transfers, further enriching fruit aroma diversity. However, strawberries are highly vulnerable to drought, which affects product quality. Plant rootassociated fungi offer a novel approach to mitigate water deficiency stress.

Fruits of fungi-inoculated plants under drought stress showed significant changes in gene expression, leading to increased total volatile ester production, primarily in acetate esters, which are important for strawberry aroma. These findings underscore the role of Antarctic fungi in modulating the metabolic pathway of volatile esters by inducing the expression of FaPDC and FaAAT genes.

To date, although many reports provided insight into the function of endophytes in their hosts, few reports focus on their impact on nearby plants. Intraspecific allelopathy in plant community is common and presents a notable challenge to medicinal plant yield and productivity. Atractylodes lancea is a perennial herb that has relatively low yields due to intraspecific allelopathy. The bacterial endophyte Pseudomonas fluorescens ALEB7B has previously been found to increase essential oil content of A. lancea, but the role of ALEB7B in A. lancea allelopathy is still unknown. Noninoculated A. lancea exhibited growth retardation when it was grown in a community, which was related to ethylene-induced intraspecific allelopathy. Further experiment showed that exposing A. lancea to volatile from noninoculated A. lancea or same concentration of ethylene reduced growth of A. lancea. P. fluorescens-inoculated plants showed reduced ethylene emission and relieved growth retardation on neighboring noninoculated A. lancea. Moreover, P. fluorescens inoculation had little allelopathic effect when receivers were treated with ethylene receptor inhibitor or when emitters were treated with ethylene production inhibitor. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that endophyte ALEB7B altered transcriptional response associated with ethylene response and essential oil production in neighboring A. lancea.

The present work concerns the isolation and identification of an endophytic filamentous fungus, together with the chemical characterization and assessment of the fluorescence, toxicity, stability, and application potential of its synthesized red colorant. The endophytic fungus was isolated from Hymenaea courbaril, a tree from the Brazilian savannah, and was identified as Talaromyces minnesotensis by phenotypic and genotypic characterization. Submerged cultivation of the fungus resulted in the production of approximately 12 AU(500) of a red biocolorant which according to LC-DAD-MS analysis is characterized by being a complex mixture of molecules of the azaphilone class. Regarding cytotoxicity assays, activity against human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells was only observed at concentrations above 5.0 g L-1, while antimicrobial effects against pathogenic bacteria and yeast occurred at concentrations above 50.0 g L-1. The biocolorant showed high stability at neutral pH values and low temperatures (10 to 20 ?) and high half-life values (t(1/2)), which indicates potential versatility for application in different matrices, as observed in tests using detergent, gelatin, enamel, paint, and fabrics.

Composition of coleorhizae of Triticum durum was studied under ambient and drought stress conditions. The OH-stretch IR absorption spectrum suggests that the water-deficit was possibly improved or moderated by kernel's endophytic partner. The OH-stretch frequency pattern coincides with other (growth and stress) related molecular changes. Analysis of lipid (3100-2800 cm(-1)) and protein (1700-1550 cm(-1)) regions seems to demonstrate that drought has a positive impact on lipids. The fungal endosymbiont direct contact with kernel during germination had highest effect on both lipid and protein (Amide I and II) groups, indicating an increased stress resistance in inoculated kernel. Compared to the indirect kernel-fungus interaction and to non-treated kernels (control), direct interaction produced highest effect on lipids. Among treatments, the fingerprint region (1800-800 cm(-1)) and SEM images indicated an important shift in glucose oligosaccharides, possibly linked to coleorhiza-polymer layer disappearance.

However, attempts to isolate the fungus from leaves and fruits have been unsuccessful. The aims of this study were therefore to determine whether M. geulakonigii is a citrus endophyte, and to assess possible mechanisms involved in its mite-antagonist activity. Methods and Results: A quantitative real-time PCR and regular PCR approaches were developed to detect M. geulakonigii in both the field and laboratory. The fungus was detected throughout. Different methods revealed that M. geulakonigii is an endophyte, which colonizes both the peel of grapefruits. Applications of conidia protected the grapefruits against CRM, and fungal secretions extracted from growth media caused 100% CRM mortality. Conclusions: Meira geulakonigii is a beneficial endophyte of grapefruits that colonizes the fruit's peel, and protects it from CRM.

These farms are situated in the midst of the prime maize and dairy farming areas of South Africa where this condition had never been diagnosed before. The individual components of the concentrate on both farms were negative for ergot alkaloids. Endophytic fungi and/or ergot infestation of teff and other grasses fed to the cows were then suspected of being involved, but neither endophytes nor ergot alkaloids could be implicated from these sources. By measuring the serum prolactin levels of groups of sheep (n = 5) fed the first farm's total mixed ration (TMR) or its three individual fibre components for a period of 11 days, the source of the ergot alkaloids was identified. A statistically significant decrease in the level of this hormone occurred only in the group on maize silage (which constituted 28 % on dry matter base of the TMR). The involvement of the maize silage was further chemically confirmed by the high levels of total ergot alkaloids, predominantly ergocryptine, found by LC-MS in the silage as well as in the TMR (115-975 ppb and 65-300 ppb, respectively). The ergot alkaloid content (mainly ergocryptine) of the maize silage on the second affected farm was 875 ppb. Withdrawal of contaminated silage resulted in gradual recovery of stock on both farms. Nut sedge (Cyperus esculentus and Cyperus rotundus of the family Cyperaceae) has a world-wide distribution and is a common weed in annual crops, and can be parasitized by Claviceps cyperi. Careful examination of the maize silage from both farms revealed that it was heavily contaminated with nut sedge and that it contained minute sclerotia, identified as those of Claviceps cyperi, originating from the latter. Nut sedge was abundant on both farms and it is believed that late seasonal rain had resulted in mature, heavily ergotised nut sedge being cut with the silage. Claviceps cyperi sclerotia, collected on the affected fields in the following autumn contained 3 600-4 000 ppm ergocryptine. That the dominant alkaloid produced by this particular fungus was indeed ergocryptine, was confirmed by negative ion chemical ionization MS/MS. In one further outbreak in another Holstein herd, teff hay contaminated with ergotised nut sedge and containing 1 200 ppb alkaloids, was incriminated as the cause of the condition.

Besides hosting a rich endophytic bacterial flora, Bryopsis also displays extraordinary wound repair and propagation mechanisms. This latter feature includes the formation of protoplasts which can survive in the absence of a cell membrane for several minutes before regenerating into new individuals. This transient 'life without a membrane' state, however, challenges the specificity of the endophytic bacterial communities present and raises the question whether these bacteria are generalists, which are repeatedly acquired from the environment, or if there is some specificity towards the Bryopsis host. To answer this question, we examined the temporal stability and the uniqueness of endobiotic bacterial communities within Bryopsis samples from the Mexican west coast after prolonged cultivation. DGGE analysis revealed that Bryopsis endophytic bacterial communities are rather stable and clearly distinct from the epiphytic and surrounding cultivation water bacterial communities. Although these endogenous communities consist of both facultative and obligate bacteria, results suggest that Bryopsis owns some intrinsic mechanisms to selectively maintain and/or attract specific bacteria after repeated wounding events in culture. This suggests that Bryopsis algae seem to master transient stages of life without a cell membrane well as they harbor specific--and possibly ecological significant--endophytic bacteria.","Life without a cell membrane: challenging the specificity of bacterial endophytes within Bryopsis (Bryopsidales, Chlorophyta).",Hollants J; Decleyre H; Leliaert F; De Clerck O; Willems A,17583,10.1186/1471-2180-11-255,2011,BMC microbiology,Presence,0.869552327,Medium (0.7-0.9),0.944550317,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.753186397,0.246813603,0.869552327,0.130447673,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Presence | Medium (0.7-0.9)

Measurement of the balance of the C-14-residues after incubation at 22 degrees C showed an increased resistance to desorption with time, as apparent desorption K-app increased from 2 to 10 1 kg(-1) in a 133 d period. Decreased extractability of the residues with incubation time and formation of bound residues up to 20% showed that the overall availability of triticonazole decreased with incubation time. The addition of diluted doses of formulation adjuvants did not significantly affect the degradation and binding of the active ingredient. Mineralization of triticonazole was slow, with a high activation energy of 130 kJ mol(-1). The persistence of triticonazole increased with application rate, as the first-order mineralization rates at 28 degrees C decreased from 2 x 10(-3) to 0.7 x 10(-3) d(-1) with amount applied increasing from 0.2 to 80 mg kg(-1). However, the absolute amount of triticonazole mineralized increased with increasing concentration in the soil solution, and the slow mineralization was attributed to limited availability in the soil solution due to high sorption.

PRS_062,B. Bock,9/26/2025,Presence,High,,"Endophytic fungi are microbes that live asymptomatically inside plant tissues. Accumulating research studies suggest that endophytic fungi have a fundamental influence on the fitness and competitiveness of their host plants. Here, we surveyed the species diversity and community structure of endophytic fungi associated with the seeds of common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.), which is a notorious invasive weed belonging to the Asteraceae family in China. The main objective was to document the distribution of the fungal symbionts and to determine at what point endophytic fungi affect seed germination and seedling development in common ragweed. Endophytic fungi were found in all common ragweed populations collected from six study locations in China, with fungal isolation rates ranging from 19% to 92.63%. Yet, the isolation rates of endophytic fungi were significantly different (P < 0.01) among all six locations, with the highest isolation rate being obtained from seeds collected from Langfang City, Hebei Province. The endophytes in common ragweed seeds were predominantly isolated from involucre, with the isolation rate reaching 65.52%. The fungal isolation rates were 21.74% for seeds and 18.18% for bracks, respectively. Five fungal genera were detected in common ragweed seeds collected from Changle City, Fujian Province. The most frequent genera of the endophytic community were Alternaria and Fusarium, which accounted for 82.26% and 9.68% of isolates, respectively. Three genera were indicated as rare endophytes in common ragweed seeds, none of which exceeded 5% of isolates. Our data indicate that endophytes from common ragweed seeds are horizontally transmitted to the next generation, because no endophytic fungi were detected in newly developed seedlings. After determining the fungal genera and their relative abundance, an experiment was conducted with fermentation broths from seven representative isolates of common endophytic fungi that are present in A. artemisiifolia seeds. The germination of common ragweed seeds and subsequent seedling development were inhibited when seeds were treated with fermentation broths from seven endophytic fungal isolates. The germination of common ragweed seeds noticeably declined (P < 0.01) when treated with fermentation broths of the seven selected fungal isolates. Fermentation broths of strain AM-17 and AM-8 had the highest inhibition effects on seed germination. The germination percentages of seeds treated with strain AM-17 and AM-8 fermentation broths were 14.92% and 17.11%, respectively, whereas the germination percentage of seeds treated with water (control) reached 86.52%. The experiments also showed that the growth of common ragweed seedlings is inhibited by treatment with fungal fermentation broths. Four out of seven fungal fermentation broths significantly (P < 0.01) reduced the aboveground stem length of common ragweed seedlings when compared to the water treatment (control). Strains AM-8 and AM-17 inhibited seedling growth the greatest. Six of seven fungal fermentation broths significantly (P < 0.01) reduced the root length of seedlings, while all fungal fermentation broths significantly (P < 0.01) reduced lateral root number. In striking contrast, lateral roots failed to develop when seedlings were treated with the fermentation broth of strains AM-17 and AM-8. Five out of the fermentation broths significantly (P < 0.01) reduced the biomass of common ragweed seedlings. Seventy-seven percent of seedlings were dead after treatment with the fermentation broth of strain AM-17 for 5 days. Seed survival was not severely (P > 0.05) affected by fungal fermentation broth treatments. Seed viability analysis indicated that most seeds (50%—87.5%) were viable after the various fungal fermentation broth treatments. Our data demonstrate that metabolites produced in fungal fermentation broths do not facilitate seed germination, but did not kill the seeds. © 2015, Ecological Society of China.

PRS_066,B. Bock,9/26/2025,Presence,High,,"Background: Rice is a drought susceptible crop. A symbiotic association between rice and mycorrhizal fungi could effectively protect the plant against sudden or frequent episodes of drought. Due to its extensive network of hyphae, the endophyte is able to deeply explore the soil and transfer water and minerals to the plant, some of them playing an important role in mitigating the effects of drought stress. Moreover, the endophyte could modify the expression of drought responsive genes and regulate antioxidants. Results: Three rice genotypes, WC-297 (drought tolerant), Caawa (moderately drought tolerant) and IR-64 (drought susceptible) were inoculated with Piriformospora indica (P. indica), a dynamic endophyte. After 20 days of co-cultivation with the fungus, rice seedlings were subjected to 15% polyethylene glycol-6000 induced osmotic stress. P. indica improved the growth of rice seedlings. It alleviated the destructive effects of the applied osmotic stress. This symbiotic association increased seedling biomass, the uptake of phosphorus and zinc, which are functional elements for rice growth under drought stress. It boosted the chlorophyll fluorescence, increased the production of proline and improved the total antioxidant capacity in leaves. The association with the endophyte also up regulated the activity of the Pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (P5CS), which is critical for the synthesis of proline.

Bock,9/26/2025,Presence,High,,"Objectives: The main aim is to elaborate a cost-effective and environmentally friendly synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by endophytic extracts isolated from Withania somnifera as a reducing and capping agent, which has proven antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella sp. Methods: Characterization of AgNPs was carried out employing ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction studies (XRD). Antibacterial activity of AgNPs was conducted by disc diffusion method antimitotic activity was also evaluated by determining mitotic index in Allium cepa root tips. Results: Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy was given a peak at 400 nm confirmed the AgNPs. The images of the SEM have confirmed the formation of AgNPs with an average size of 40 nm. XRD results were remarkable in confirmation of synthesized AgNPs with distinct XRD peaks at 2θ values of 38, 44, 64, and 77 lattice planes were observed which indexed the facts of silver (111), (200), (220), and (311), respectively. The AgNPs showed effective antibacterial activity against tested microorganisms at 100 µg/discs concentrations. A significant mitotic index (22.8±1.4b and 26.9±0.9b) was observed in A. cepa root tips at 10 mg/ml, 5 mg/ml concentration, respectively. Conclusion: It can be concluded that the endophytes of W. somnifera can be a good source for AgNP synthesis and showed a significant antimicrobial activity against tested microorganisms, especially E. coli followed by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Suggestive results were found in antimitotic activity which one of screening methods for development of anticancer drugs.

Bock,9/26/2025,Presence,High,,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungi are ubiquitous in grass roots, but their colonizations may vary according to latitudinal gradient and site conditions. We investigated how vegetation zone (boreal vs. subarctic), humus thickness, and site openness affect root fungal colonizations of the grass Avenella flexuosa. More precisely, we hypothesized that AM and DSE fungal colonizations would have different responses to environmental conditions such that AM fungi could be more common in boreal zone, whereas we expected DSE fungi to be more affected by the amount of humus. We found site openness to affect AM and DSE fungi in a contrasting manner, in interaction with the vegetation zone. AM colonization was high at open coastal dunes, whereas DSE fungi were more common at forested sites, in the boreal zone. Humus thickness affected AM fungi negatively and DSE fungi positively. To conclude, the observed AM and DSE fungal colonization patterns were largely contrasting. AM fungi were favored in seashore conditions characterized by thin humus layer, whereas DSE fungi were favored in conditions of higher humus availability.",Contrasting preferences of arbuscular mycorrhizal and dark septate fungi colonizing boreal and subarctic Avenella flexuosa,"Kauppinen, M; Raveala, K; Wäli, PR; Ruotsalainen, AL",9885,10.1007/s00572-013-0526-7,2014,MYCORRHIZA,Presence,0.757218906,Medium (0.7-0.9),0.952822543,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.542369169,0.457630831,0.757218906,0.242781094,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Presence | Medium (0.7-0.9)

As an endophyte, B. bassiana may play a role in protecting plants from herbivory and disease. This protocol demonstrates two inoculation methods to establish B. bassiana endophytically in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), in preparation for subsequent evaluations of endophytic biological control. Plants are grown from surface-sterilized seeds for two weeks before receiving a B. bassiana treatment of 108 conidia/ml (or water) applied either as a foliar spray or a soil drench. Two weeks later, the plants are harvested and their leaves, stems and roots are sampled to evaluate endophytic fungal colonization. For this, samples are individually surface sterilized, cut into multiple sections, and incubated in potato dextrose agar media for 20 days. The media is inspected every 2-3 days to observe fungal growth associated with plant sections and record the occurrence of B. bassiana to estimate the extent of its endophytic colonization. Analyses of inoculation success compare the occurrence of B. bassiana within a given plant part (i. e. leaves, stems or roots) across treatments and controls. In addition to the inoculation method, the specific outcome of the experiment may depend on the target crop species or variety, the fungal entomopathogen species strain or isolate used, and the plant's growing conditions.",Establishing Fungal Entomopathogens as Endophytes: Towards Endophytic Biological Control,"Parsa, S; Ortiz, V; Vega, FE",11876,10.3791/50360,2013,JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS,Presence,0.74561143,Medium (0.7-0.9),0.945179075,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.615929469,0.384070531,0.74561143,0.25438857,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Presence | Medium (0.7-0.9)
PRS_075,B. Bock,9/26/2025,Review,High,,"Huperzine A (HupA) is an effective inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase and has attracted great interest as a therapeutic candidate for Alzheimer's disease. However, the use of HupA is limited by resource scarcity as well as by its low yields from Huperzia serrata, its primary plant source. Recent studies have shown that this compound is produced by various endophytic fungi, thereby providing a promising alternative source, as fungi are much more amenable than plants owing to their simpler genetics and the ease of manipulation. In this review, we summarize the progress in research on the methods to increase HupA production, including fermentation conditions, fungal elicitors, gene expression, and the activation of key enzymes. This review provides guidance for further studies on HupA-producing endophytic fungi aimed at efficient HupA synthesis and accumulation, and offers new approaches for studies on the regulation of high-value bioactive secondary metabolites.",Research on endophytic fungi for producing huperzine A on a large-scale.,Sang X; Yang M; Su J,17716,10.1080/1040841X.2020.1819771,2020,Critical reviews in microbiology,Presence,0.745431093,Medium (0.7-0.9),0.896723749,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.745431093,0.254568907,0.727618073,0.272381927,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Presence | Medium (0.7-0.9)

The bioactive potential of HE19ct, identified as Penicillium brevicompactum according to ITS-BenA-caM, was addressed. Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and secondary metabolite contents using four culture media in Agar-plate (ApF) and Submerged (SmF) fermentation were evaluated. Some plant growth -promoting (PGP) traits and their related genes were tested. HE19ct exhibited antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Fusarium sp., Geotrichum candidum, and Alternaria sp. All cultures showed DPPH scavenging activity and phenolic compounds, where ethyl acetate extract of SmF with malt extract showed higher activity and SmF/ApF with potato-dextrose exhibited higher yield, respectively. HE19ct solubilized tricalcium-phosphate and produced siderophore, endoglucanase, pro-teinase, and amylase. It enhanced the alfalfa's germination at 15 degrees C, root development, and phenols production at 15 and 24 degrees C. Phenols, tannins, anthraquinones, triterpenoids/steroids, and alkaloids production were detected depending on culture media. Polyketide synthase type I gene (PksI), subtilisin-like protease prb 1 (Pbr), and siderophore D (sidD) were PCR-amplified.

In Exp. 1, rabbits (n = 6/treatment) fed E+ fescue seed diets (20%, 340 ppb total ergot alkaloids) had reduced (P < .05) intake and weight gain compared with endophyte-free (E-) controls, whereas apparent diet digestibility was not different between E+ and E-. Rabbits immunized against ergot alkaloids (E+ vac) with lysergol conjugated to human serum albumin (Ly-HSA) had greater (P < .05) intake than E+ rabbits during the wk 1 of a 3-wk dietary challenge. In Exp. 2, rabbits (n = 4/treatment) were immunized with Ly-HSA, with H100-B (ergot alkaloid hapten, H100-different protein carrier, B conjugate), or combinations of both with alum as adjuvant. Greatest (P < .001) anti-ergot alkaloid antibody (Ab) titer developed in the group immunized with H100-B. In Exp. 3, rabbits (n = 4/treatment) were immunized with the immunogen H100-B in conjunction with six adjuvants. Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA) in combination with DEAE-dextran and FIA alone gave highest anti-ergot titers. In summary, rabbit weight gain and intake were reduced by feeding E+ fescue seed diets, immunization against ergot alkaloids provided temporary improvement in intake, and H100-B conjugate with FIA or FIA + DEAE-dextran as adjuvants elicited a superior anti-ergot immune response.
