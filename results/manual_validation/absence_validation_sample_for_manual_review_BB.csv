In plant roots, complex microbial communities participate in plant nutrition and development as well as in the protection against stresses. The establishment of the root microbiota is a dynamic process in space and time regulated by abiotic (e.g., edaphic, climate, etc.) and biotic factors (e.g., host genotype, root exudates, etc.). In the last 20 years, the development of metabarcoding surveys, based on high-throughput next-generation sequencing methods, identified the main drivers of microbial community structuration. However, identification of plant-associated microbes by sequencing should be complemented by imaging techniques to provide information on the micrometric spatial organization and its impact on plant-fungal and fungal-fungal interactions. Laser scanning confocal microscopy can provide both types of information and is now used to investigate communities of endophytic, endomycorrhizal, and ectomycorrhizal fungi.

It is necessary to investigate the effects of flue-curing and redrying on diversity and succession of tobacco fungal communities. It was shown that a total of 9 phyla, 33 classes, 94 orders, 266 families, 646 genera, and 6,396 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were identified in the fungi communities of 36 samples from different processing stages (before flue-curing, after flue-curing, before redrying and after redrying) based on high-throughput sequencing technology. Dominant genera shared by tobacco leaves at different stages were Alternaria and Sampaiozyma. About 80% of fungi in stored tobacco leaves after redrying originated from fresh tobacco leaves before flue-curing, while the rest were primarily enriched in the post-harvest processing environment. After flue-curing, major molds like Aspergillus and Penicillium were notably enriched. The distribution of fungal communities suggested that the flue-curing and redrying had a significant impact on fungal composition. Functional annotation of fungal communities at the guild level exhibited differences during processing stages. Main fungal functional groups were identified. In summary, our study elucidated dynamic changes in the composition of fungal communities and highlighted key stages in mold enrichment during tobacco leaf processing, laying groundwork for mildew prevention and control during tobacco leaf fermentation. © The Author(s) 2024.",The effect of flue-curing and redrying on the diversity of fungal communities in tobacco leaves,Yang Y.; Pan G.; Guo J.; Miao C.; Xu Q.; Zhang Y.; Yang M.; Xue C.; Hu L.; Hu Z.,16209,10.1186/s12866-024-03635-4,2024,BMC Microbiology,Absence,0.999992903,High (≥0.9),ML,0.889389451,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Absence,Absence,0.163500833,0.836499167,0.999992903,7.10E-06,Absence,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Absence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Absence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Absence | ML | High (≥0.9)

The rhizobacteria which are inoculated in seeds through biopriming are proven to increase seed growth. The study aims to obtain the potential indigenous rhizobacteria from areca nut plant rhizosphere on marginal soil of Southeast Sulawesi. Research was arranged in a completely randomized design (CRD) consisting of 10 isolates. The isolates were evaluated their ability to solubilize phosphate, fix nitrogen and synthesize IAA growth hormone. Also evaluated the effect of these isolates in increasing the root length of rice seedlings. Before tested, rice seeds were treated with rhizobacterium isolates of endo-rhizobacteria and germinated using standard germination procedures. Root length was observed on the 7th day after planting. At the same time all isolates were evaluated for their ability to solubilize phosphate, fix N and synthesize IAA. The results showed that seed treatment using endo-rhizobacteria significantly increased the root length of treated rice seeds (percentage increase compared to untreated seeds at root length up to 140%). All rhizobacteria isolates tested were able to solubilize phosphate, fix N and synthesize IAA. Although all of the rhizobacteria synthesized IAA, growth promoting effects of the rhizobacteria may not only be due to the synthesized growth regulator. Other factors may have involved in the positive effects of the endo-rhizobacteria on rice seed germination. The endophytic and rhizobacterial dominant from the areca nut rhizosphere are the Pseudomonas spp. and the Bacillus spp. and have ability to solubilize phosphate, fix nitrogen and synthesize IAA and also could increase rice seed growth.","Characterization of Endophytic-rhizobacteria from Areca Nut Rhizosphere to Dissolve Phosphates, Nitrogen Fixation of IAA Hormone Synthesis.",Sutariati GAK; Rahni NM; Madiki A; Mudi L; Guyasa IM; Zahrima NA,17876,10.3923/pjbs.2020.240.247,2020,Pakistan journal of biological sciences : PJBS,Absence,0.999971791,High (≥0.9),ML,0.891264021,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Absence,Absence,0.159790765,0.840209235,0.999971791,2.82E-05,Absence,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Absence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Absence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Absence | ML | High (≥0.9)

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that rhizospheric and endophytic microorganisms isolated from the roots of Hymenaea courbaril L. in two biomes with distinct ecological characteristics - the Pantanal wetland and the Cerrado savanna - present distinct functional traits. We also evaluated the functional diversity (H ') of the microbiota and the potential effects of soil parameters, such as Organic Material (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and nutrient concentrations, on the relative abundance of the microorganisms with functional traits such as the solubilization of phosphates (CaHPO4, AlPO4, and FePO4), the synthesis of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and the ACC deaminase enzyme, and antibiosis to the phytopathogens Fusarium sp., Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and Rhizoctonia sp. A higher percentage of the micro-organisms from the Pantanal (in comparison with the Cerrado) presented intense or very intense function in the synthesis of IAA and antibiosis, with a higher degree of specialization (reduced functional diversity) in the former trait (H' = 0.73) and a lower degree in the latter (H' = 0.91 for antibiosis to Fusarium sp.; H' = 0.97 for S. sclerotiorum, and H' = 0.80 for Rhizoctonia sp.). The micro-organisms of the Cerrado were more effective in the solubilization of phosphates, and the mean concentrations of P solubilized by these micro-organisms were higher than those observed in the isolates from the Pantanal, when the sources were AlPO4 and FePO4, which indicates a potential relationship between the high concentrations of Al and Fe found naturally in the soils of the Cerrado and the functional traits of its endemic microbiota. We also observed high levels of diversity in the functional traits of the Cerrado micro-organisms involved in solubilization (H' = 1.09 for CaHPO4, H' = 1.05 for AlPO4, and H' = 1.09 for FePO4). All the isolates from both biomes synthetized ACC deaminase very intensively. In the Pantanal, soil parameters such as pH, OM, CEC, and the levels of Mn and Fe, as well as the Fe concentrations in the root and aerial portion of the plant affected the relative abundance of the micro-organisms that had efficient functional traits. In the Cerrado soil, the parameters pH, CEC, and the Mn, Mg, and Fe concentrations, as well as the level of Fe in the aerial part of the plant all affected the relative abundance. We proved our hypothesis on the specialization of the micro-organisms for specific functional traits, and also that the functionality of the symbiotic microbiota is influenced by environmental parameters. The present study provides important insights into the interactions between the soil and the endophytic root and rhizospheric micro-organisms isolated from H. courbaril L. in the Pantanal and Cerrado biomes.

Fourteen pathogenic and nine endophytic strains of C. guaranicola were isolated from guarana leaves with and without anthracnose symptoms, respectively. The enzymatic activities of protease, amylase, polyphenol oxidase, lipase, pectinase, and cellulolytic activities were evaluated for each fungal strain. The experimental design for each enzymatic assay was completely randomized with five replicates.

ABS_012,B. Bock,9/23/2025,Presence,ML,High,,"Background and objectives Legumes are widely regarded as one of the most significant protein sources in human and animal food chains. The common bean is the primary legume crop, accounting for 85% of global bean production. The scientific community's primary priority is to develop innovative techniques to assure food security in addition to agricultural product safety, while simultaneously implementing realistic plans to reduce the usage of pesticides and artificial fertilizers. Among the investigated solutions, the utilization of beneficial microbes is one of the key components in establishing a green rotation in agricultural systems across the world. This study aimed to evaluate the endophytic role of native Beauveria species on the development and biochemical characteristics of common beans. Materials and methods Spore suspension (1 × 108 ml-1) was produced after a 10-day culture of the species. The spore suspension was introduced to the soil after the seeds had been disinfected during planting. To assess the fungus's establishment in the plants, samples were collected up to 25 days following inoculation. The experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design with three replications for each treatment, and parameters such as dry and fresh root and shoot weight, plant height, root length, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, carotenoid, phenol, proline, and polyphenol oxidase enzyme were determined. SAS software was used to analyze the data, and Duncan's multiple range test was used to compare means at a P-value of <0.05. Results Beauveria species injected with 1 × 108 ml-1 spores per milliliter were re-isolated by cultured bean root, stem, and leaf tissues in PDA culture media, confirming endophytic fungi. These two Beauveria species were capable of establishing systematic colonization in tissues from all bean organs. The study found that employing B. pseudobassiana and B. bassiana, as well as integrating these two species, raised bean plant height by 37.7, 20.2, and 41.4%, respectively, compared to the control treatment. Similarly, applying these treatments increased root length by 15.5, 24.5, and 32.7%, respectively, compared to the control treatment. According to the findings of this study, B. pseudobassiana, B. bassiana, and the mixture of these two fungal species increased the dry weight of the aerial sections of beans by 50.6, 36.9, and 72.6 percent, respectively. Furthermore, the use of B. bassiana, B. pseudobassiana, or a mixture of these two species elevated root dry weight by 44.1%, 39.5%, and 55.8%, respectively, in comparison with the control treatment. In general, all treatments produced more chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total chlorophyll than the control treatment. The combination of two species resulted in the maximum number of features, which were 153.9%, 162.8%, and 156.9%, respectively, in comparison with the control treatment. The results indicated that the amount of Carotenoid, polyphenol oxidase enzyme, phenol, and proline rose considerably when two fungal species were used alone or in combination, compared to the control treatment. Discussion Endophytic B. pseudobassiana has been the subject of no prior research, based on our findings. The fungal strains used in the current study were re-isolated from the roots and other parts of the plant, indicating that the inoculated strains colonized the studied bean plants systematically. Entomopathogenic fungi have recently attracted the attention of researchers for the profits they provide to their hosts, particularly in plant growth. The findings revealed that employing endophytic fungi and interacting with them might enhance the morpho-physiological properties of bean plants. As a result, we discovered that entomopathogenic fungi might act as both endophytic and plant growth boosters. In spite of the current proceedings, more study is required to investigate the endophytic nature of these native species in other hosts, their effect on pathogen and insect control, and their effect on metabolites, hormones, and micro-nutrients using various inoculation methods. © 2025 by the authors.

ABS_013,B. Bock,9/23/2025,Irrelevant,ML,High,,"The fungicide dexon (p-dimethylaminobenzenediazosulfonate, Na-salt) inhibits the NADH oxidase activity of submitochondrial particles (ETP) from beef heart (semi-inhibition concentration 1.4 muM), while the succinate oxidase activity is unaffected. Measurements of the activity of several enzymatic partial reactions of the respiratory chain of ETP suggest that dexon acts directly on the flavine of NADH dehydrogenase. Soluble NADH-cytochrome c-oxidoreductase (MAHLER) and rotenone-insensitive NADH ubiquinone reductase are also inhibited by dexon. At low concentrations of dexon, inhibition of ETP starts slowly only after addition of NADH. Preincubation without NADH increases the amount of inhibition, but does not prevent the time delay. It is assumed that an electron flux through the respiratory chain, or reduction of flavine is prerequisite for the reaction of dexon with the action site. Furthermore, dexon inhibits the NADH dehydrogenase located at the outer surface of the inner membrane of plant mitochondria, accessible to extramitochondrial NADH and insensitive to rotenone, as has been shown on isolated mitochondria from cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L). In addition, dexon inhibits selectively the NADH dehydrogenase of the DT diaphorase (ERNSTER) from rat liver cytosol. In contrast, the dicoumarol-insensitive NADH dehydrogenase (ZINSMEYER et al.) from rat liver cytosol, the NADH-cytochrome b5-reductase (STRITTMATTER) from rat liver microsomes, the rotenone-insensitive NADH-cytochrome c-oxidoreductase of the outer membrane of rat liver mitochondria, soluble NADH-oxidase from Escherichia coli, and NADH-dehydrogenase from human erythrocytes are not inhibited.

Wide range use of antifungal agents specially azole compounds in treatment of sever Candidiasis has resulted in fungal resistance in Candida species, there fore, it is necessary to use antifungal susceptibility tests before selecting a suitable drug for such above mentioned infections which can resulted in the decrease in secondary drug resistance and better manipulation of treatment protocols. Objective: The present study was done with the aim of evaluating antifungal effects of a aqueous and essential oils prepared from Thymus vulgaris and Origanum vulgare against fluconazole (FLZ) susceptible and Fluconazole resistance Candida albicans strains isolated from different types of Candida using standard drug susceptibility tests. Methods: Evaluation of FLZ susceptibility of C. albicans strains by disk diffusion method showed 26 (78 %), 4 (12.1 %) and 3 (9.9 %) isolates were susceptible, dose - dependence and resistant, respectively. Aqueous and essential oils from both Thymums vulgaris and Origanum vulgare showed inhibitory effects on growth of FLZ-susceptible C. albicans isolates, where as, only essential oils from Thymus vulgaris were found to be able to inhibit growth of FLZ-resistant C. albicans isolates. Resultrs: These resultrs show that there is a direct relationship between FLZ resistance and resistance to both thymus and Origanum in C.albicans. Thus, it is seems that these two plants could inhibit C. albicans growth by a similar mechanism which occure by FLZ.

Bock,9/23/2025,Presence,ML,High,,"In order to study the degradation of pruned tea leaves by Trichoderma brevicompactum, a pot experiment was designed, which included four treatments; CK (pruned tea leaves and sterilized water), BY (pruned tea leaves and sterilized fermentation broth of T. brevicompactum), FG (pruned tea leaves, T. brevicompactum and sterilized water), and (pruned tea leaves, T. brevicompactum and sterilized fermentation broth). The changes in soil fungi were detected by PCR-DGGE. The results showed that the application of T. Brevicompactum not only accelerated the softening speed of pruned tea leaves but also improved the browning degree of pruned tea leaves. After being treated for 60 days, the degradation rate of cellulose in pruned tea leaves increased by 18.16% in FG treatment and 19.02% in BF treatment, compared with CK and BF respectively. An obvious promotion effect on lignin degradation was observed in FG and BF treatments, and the degradation rate of lignin was accelerated during 30-45 days. The degradation rates of lignin in FG and BF treatments were increased by 12.49% and 9.61% after 60 days of incubation, compared with CK and BF respectively. At the early stage, cellulase and lignin enzyme activities were much higher in FG and BF than in Ck and BY, respectively, while they were insignificantly lower than that in CK at the later stage. After 60 days, there were some differences in the quantity of soil fungal communities between the treatment groups, but their community structure was similar. In conclusion, T. brevicompactum can improve the decomposition of pruned tea leaves and has little effect on soil fungal communities. © 2015, Chinese Journal of Ecology.

Trichoderma utilizes direct antagonism and competition, particularly in the rhizosphere, where it modulates the composition of and interactions with other microorganisms. In its colonization of plants, on the roots or as an endophyte, Trichoderma has evolved the capacity to communicate with the plant and produce numerous multifaceted benefits to its host. The intricacy of this plant-microorganism association has stimulated a marked interest in research on Trichoderma, ranging from its capacity as a plant growth promoter to its ability to prime local and systemic defence responses against biotic and abiotic stresses and to activate transcriptional memory affecting plant responses to future stresses. This Review discusses the ecophysiology and diversity of Trichoderma and the complexity of its relationships in the agroecosystem, highlighting its potential as a direct and indirect biological control agent, biostimulant and biofertilizer, which are useful multipurpose properties for agricultural applications.

Basic method for detection of organ/systemic fungal infection is serological monitoring in body fluids, first of all in serum, bu also in broncho-alveolar lavages (BALF). Proven invasive fungal infection should be diagnosed by culture of the pathogen or histopathological examination of infected tissues, however the detection of soluble fungal antigens in body fluids gives enough information for diagnosis of probable fungal infection, according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer recommendations, what allows introduction of antifungal therapy. Aim of the study was to asses the frequency of detection of circulation soluble fungal antigens with use of immunoenzymatic techniques in patients hospitalized between 2010 and 2015 in Independent Public Central Clinical Hospital (IPCCH) in Warsaw. In IPCCH, between 2010 and 2015, 6475 serum samples, taken from 2096 patients, was tested for Candida spp. mannan antigen, and 7745 sera from 2243 patients were tested for Candida spp. mannan antigen, and 7745 sera from 2243 patients were tested for galactomannan antigen of Aspergillus spp, as well as 64 samples of BALF.

Their exploitation in agro-ecosystems as an eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative to traditional chemical inputs may positively affect agricultural productivity and environmental sustainability. The present study describes selected rhizobacteria, from a range of origins, having plant growth promoting potential under controlled conditions. A total of 98 isolates (ectophytic or endophytic) from various crop and uncultivated plants were screened, out of which four endophytes (n, L, K and Y) from Phalaris arundinacea, Solanum dulcamara, Scorzoneroides autumnalis, and Glycine max, respectively, were selected in vitro for their vegetative growth stimulating effects on Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 seedlings with regard to leaf surface area and shoot fresh weight. A 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of the strains indicated that these isolates belong to the genera Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Mucilaginibacter and Rhizobium. Strains were then further tested for their effects on abiotic stress alleviation under both Petri-plate and pot conditions. Results from Petri-dish assay indicated strains L, K and Y alleviated salt stress in Arabidopsis seedlings, while strains K and Y conferred increases in fresh weight and leaf area under osmotic stress. Results from subsequent in vivo trials indicated all the isolates, especially strains L, K and Y, distinctly increased A. thaliana growth under both normal and high salinity conditions, as compared to control plants. The activity of antioxidant enzymes (ascorbate peroxidase, catalase and peroxidase), proline content and total antioxidative capacity also differed in the inoculated A. thaliana plants. Furthermore, a study on spatial distribution of the four strains, using either conventional Petri-plate counts or GFP-tagged bacteria, indicated that all four strains were able to colonize the endosphere of A. thaliana root tissue. Thus, the study revealed that the four selected rhizobacteria are good candidates to be explored as plant growth stimulators, which also possess salt stress mitigating property, partially by regulating osmolytes and antioxidant enzymes.

ABS_032,B. Bock,9/23/2025,Presence,ML,High,,"Osteospermum (African Daisy or Cape Daisy) is a genus belonging to the Calendulae with a large number of perennial plant species. In February of 2007, a severe damping-off occurred on 3- to 4-month-old potted cuttings of Osteospermum 'Impassion Rose Purple', 'Impassion White', 'Impassion Purple', and 'Impassion White Rose' cultivated in a nursery in eastern Sicily. More than 30% of the plants were infected. Disease symptoms consisted of extensive water-soaked lesions at the base of the stem followed by wilt and collapse of the plant. Isolations from diseased tissues on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with streptomycin sulfate at 100 mg/l consistently recovered a fungus with morphological characteristics of Rhizoctonia solani. Fungal colonies were initially white, turned brown after 2 to 3 days, and produced irregularly shaped, brown sclerotia after 1 week. Microscopic examination revealed that hyphae had right angle branching patterns, were constricted at the base of the branch near the union with main hyphae, and septate near the constriction. The number of nuclei per hyphal cell was determined on cultures grown at 25°C on 2% water agar in petri plates. Mycelium was stained with 0.5% aniline blue solution (4) and examined with a microscope at ×400. The hyphal cells were all multinucleate. Anastomosis groups were determined by pairing isolates (3) with tester isolates of AG-1 IA, AG-2-2-1, AG-2-2IIIB, AG-2-2IV, AG-3, AG-4, AG-5, AG-6, and AG-11. Anastomosis was observed only with tester isolates of AG-4, giving C2 reactions (1) at a high frequency. The identification of group AG-4 within R. solani had been obtained by electrophoretic patterns of pectic enzymes (polygalacturonases) in vertical pectin-acrylamide gel stained with ruthenium red (2). All isolates of R. solani collected from infected plants were paired in all combinations on PDA plus 1% activated charcoal and examined for somatic interaction. All paired colonies merged without producing visible tufts of aerial mycelium. Absence of tufts and the lack of formation of heterokaryon at the hyphal interaction zone indicated that all isolates belonged to the same mating type with the same mating alleles (3). Pathogenicity tests were performed by placing plugs of PDA from 5-day-old mycelial cultures in the soil near the base of the stem on 20 potted, healthy, 2-month-old cuttings of Osteospermum cv. Impassion Rose Purple. The same number of plants treated with 1/cm2 PDA plugs served as controls. Following inoculation, all plants were maintained in a growth chamber at 25°C and 95% relative humidity on a 12-h fluorescent light/dark regimen. Wilt symptoms and lesions at the base of stem identical to those observed in the nursery developed 7 days after inoculation, and all inoculated plants died within 20 days. Control plants remained symptomless. R. solani AG-4 was consistently reisolated from symptomatic tissues, completing Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of damping-off on the genus Osteospermum caused by R. solani. References: (1) D. E. Carling.

Bock,9/23/2025,Irrelevant,ML,High,Humans,"In recent years, despite of significant progress in the treatment of premature infants with extremely low body weight, still a significant problem remains severe, treatment-resistant generalized infections among which the percentage of fungal infections is increasing. The invasive candidiasis, especially caused by non-albicans species of Candida, are of particular importance. In the case of resistance on fluconazole and amphotericin B the use of echinocandin drug may be a useful choice. This paper reviews the pharmacokinetics of caspofungin in neonates and children, as well as the case reports and clinical trials on the use of caspofungin in neonates, including the premature infants. We describe also the premature neonate with low birth weight and a generalized infection caused by Candida glabrata, where, despite of the treatment based on the sensitivity of the fungus it did not achieve clinical improvement and sterilization of cultures. It was not until the lead-in of caspofungin in dose 2 mg/kg/day allowed to cure the patient. There was a transient increase in the activity of aminotransferases and level of bilirubin as a complication of treatment. At the end of application of caspofungin the liver functions have been slowly normalized. Caspofungin appeared to be effective in the treatment of systemic fungal C. glabrata in premature neonate with extremely low birth weight. Echinocandins, including caspofungin, appear to be a promising alternative to previously used agents in the treatment of invasive Candida infections in newborns.

The natural compounds derived from the endophytic flora of fungi are possible solutions to cancer treatment because they are safe for health, cost-effective, biocompatible and have fewer toxicity issues. The active ingredients in endophytic fungi that are responsible for anti-cancer activities are alkaloids, terpenoids, glycosides, saponin, peptides, steroids, phenols, quinones, and flavonoids. This review highlights the anti-cancer activities of entophytic fungus against human papillary thyroid carcinoma (IHH4), human pancreatic (PANC-1), ovarian (OVCAR-3), hepatic (HepG2), lung (A-549), human lymphoma (U937), human skin carcinoma (A431), breast (MCF-7), and Kaposi's sarcoma. The emerging evidence suggested that bioactive compounds isolated from endophytic fungi showed their anti-cancer activities by revealing the disturbance of the microtubule network caused by increased levels of Bax and Bcl-2 proteins that triggers cell cycle arrest at the G2-M phase, by inhibiting the DNA replication via binding with topoisomerase II, by regulating the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and NF-kB, by evaluating the levels of p21, p27, and cyclins B/D1/E that led to cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. This review will assist readers in better comprehending bioactive chemicals and the beneficial interaction between the fungal endophytes and medicinal plants.","Exploring the anticancer activities of novel bioactive compounds derived from endophytic fungi: mechanisms of action, current challenges and future perspectives.",Kousar R; Naeem M; Jamaludin MI; Arshad A; Shamsuri AN; Ansari N; Akhtar S; Hazafa A; Uddin J; Khan A; Al-Harrasi A,21429,NA,2022,American journal of cancer research,Absence,0.999060134,High (≥0.9),ML,0.934421604,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Absence,Absence,0.152927831,0.847072169,0.999060134,9.40E-04,Absence,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Absence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Absence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Absence | ML | High (≥0.9)

However, the mechanism of their interactions with the host needs further study. To explore the mechanism of endophytic bacterium ginkgo endophyte KM-1-2, we managed to forecast its secretory proteins based on its genome and explicit characteristics. Signal peptide analysis software SignalP, transmembrane helical structure analysis software TMHMM and Phobius, cells position software PSORT, subcellar localization software TargetP and GPI anchor site analysis software big-PI Predictor were used to predict the scope of all secreted proteins, which were defined as secretome. Altogether 128 typical signal peptide secretory proteins were screened out of 5299 protein sequences in KM-1-2 genome, accounting for 2.4% of the whole genome. The shortest ORF encoding these proteins is 61 bp, the longest one is 2105 bp and the average is 373 bp. The length of the signal peptide guiding secretory protein was distributed between 15 to 37 aa, with the average length of 24 aa. Amino acid with the highest present frequency of signal peptide in proper order is alanine, leucine and valine. The type of signal peptide cleavage belongs to A-X-A which named SPI cleavage type.

Recent evidence strongly suggests that by introducing beneficial microbes during the seed or seedling stages, the diversity and assembly structure of the plant-related microbial community during later plant development can be altered, recruiting beneficial bacteria to enhance plant protection. However, the mechanisms of community assembly and their effects on plant growth are still not fully understood. To deepen our understanding of the importance of early inoculation for improving plant performance, this review comprehensively summarizes recent research advancements on the effects of early introduction on plant growth and adaptability.

We also studied feeding preferences of neonates and 5th instars, including possible effects of induction of preference, to clarify patterns of movement of larvae between creeping bentgrass, Agrostis palustris Hudson, putting greens and peripheral areas. Development of black cutworms on 3 diverse cultivars of Kentucky bluegrass, Poa pratensis L., was much poorer than on all other turfgrasses tested. Most larvae that fed on Kentucky bluegrass did not survive to pupation. In contrast, endophyte-free 'Assure' perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne L., and 'SR8300' tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea Schreber, were generally as suitable for cutworms as creeping bentgrass, the standard grass used on putting greens. Larvae reared on endophyte-infected SR8300 tall fescue showed no adverse effects; those fed endophyte-infected Assure perennial ryegrass showed only small reductions in growth rate compared with larvae reared on the same cultivar without endophyte. In laboratory choice tests, 1-d-old larvae consistently preferred creeping bentgrass over Kentucky bluegrass or tall fescue, regardless of which grass they had fed upon during the preceding 24 h. There was evidence for induction of preference for perennial ryegrass over creeping bentgrass in 1 of 2 trials. Preferences of 5th instars were more variable, but creeping bentgrass was preferred consistently over Kentucky bluegrass. In paired field plots, 5th instars did not discriminate between creeping bentgrass and perennial ryegrass, but preferred both of those species over Kentucky bluegrass. These results indicate that black cutworm densities could build up in areas of tall fescue or perennial ryegrass surrounding golf course putting greens and tees, and that endophyte infection of those grasses will not necessarily provide resistance. Use of Kentucky bluegrass in higher-mowed, peripheral areas may reduce numbers of black cutworms developing in roughs and fairways and later crawling onto putting greens.","Turfgrass species and endophyte effects on survival, development, and feeding preference of black cutworms (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae)","Williamson, RC; Potter, DA",19947,NA,1997,JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY,Absence,0.998856061,High (≥0.9),ML,0.968057579,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Absence,Absence,0.103013998,0.896986002,0.998856061,0.001143939,Absence,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Absence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Absence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Absence | ML | High (≥0.9)

One comprising 205 isolates belonged to ascomycetes (69%), another of 48 basidiomycetes (16%), and the last of 43 belonged to zygomycetes (15%). This revealed high taxonomic diversity in fungal composition, including typical orchid mycorrhiza of the Tulasnella and several other endophytic fungi of the Pezizales and Helotiales. The compositions of the fungal communities correlated with host identify or preference. Because of their relatively closer phylogenetic distance, the fungi communities between Cymbidium goeringii and Cymbidium goeringii var. longibracteatum shared more taxa than any others, whether the comparisons were within wild plants or transplants. Two different regions significantly affected the root-associated fungi assemblages. Besides the predominant one, the overlap, even between the common hosts at two sites, shared extremely limited taxa. Orchids of Cymbidium spp. from the wild habitat had a higher number and taxa of root-associated fungi besides the Tulasnella sp. than the transplanted orchids.

Results showed that both Bs and Si treatments enhanced Chl and carbon metabolism, with the combined Bs and Si treatment showing a synergistic effect.

Asymptomatic shoots were collected at eight different growth stages. Nodes, internodes, leaf petioles, leaves, tendrils and bunch rachides were surface sterilised, cut into smaller pieces and plated out on potato dextrose agar. After the fungal endophytes were identified, the relative importance (RI) values were calculated and a correspondence analysis performed on the data of taxa with RI larger than 5%. Of the 46 different fungal taxa found. 20 were present at relative importance values of more than 1%. An analysis of the relative importance of the different species showed that the most frequently isolated fungi were members of the Alternaria alternata complex (40%) and Sphaeropsis sp. (27%). The Phomopsis viticola complex had a relative importance of 9% and accounted for 3% of the isolations. P. viticola was mainly isolated from the nodes and internodes, the plant parts in which I? viticola usually causes disease symptoms. Two different Phomopsis spp. were isolated, with 94% of the isolates representing P. viticola taxon 2, and the rest taxon 1. Isolations made from diseased vine material during the last two years revealed taxon 2 to be dominant in vineyards in the Western Cape. Inoculations into healthy, young vine tissue also showed taxon 2 to be a primary pathogen, further suggesting that it is probably a latent pathogen rather than an endophyte.

ABS_067,B. Bock,9/23/2025,Irrelevant,ML,High,Bacteria,"Bacterial intracellular symbiosis (endosymbiosis) is widespread in nature and impacts many biological processes. In holometabolous symbiotic insects, metamorphosis entails a complete and abrupt internal reorganization that creates a constraint for endosymbiont transmission from larvae to adults. To assess how endosymbiosis copes-and potentially evolves-throughout this major host-tissue reorganization, we used the association between the cereal weevil Sitophilus oryzae and the bacterium Sodalis pierantonius as a model system. S. pierantonius are contained inside specialized host cells, the bacteriocytes, that group into an organ, the bacteriome. Cereal weevils require metabolic inputs from their endosymbiont, particularly during adult cuticle synthesis, when endosymbiont load increases dramatically. By combining dual RNA-sequencing analyses and cell imaging, we show that the larval bacteriome dissociates at the onset of metamorphosis and releases bacteriocytes that undergo endosymbiosis-dependent transcriptomic changes affecting cell motility, cell adhesion, and cytoskeleton organization. Remarkably, bacteriocytes turn into spindle cells and migrate along the midgut epithelium, thereby conveying endosymbionts to midgut sites where future mesenteric caeca will develop. Concomitantly, endosymbiont genes encoding a type III secretion system and a flagellum apparatus are transiently up-regulated while endosymbionts infect putative stem cells and enter their nuclei. Infected cells then turn into new differentiated bacteriocytes and form multiple new bacteriomes in adults. These findings show that endosymbiosis reorganization in a holometabolous insect relies on a synchronized host-symbiont molecular and cellular ""choreography"" and illustrates an adaptive feature that promotes bacteriome multiplication to match increased metabolic requirements in emerging adults.",Spatial and morphological reorganization of endosymbiosis during metamorphosis accommodates adult metabolic requirements in a weevil.,Maire J; Parisot N; Galvao Ferrarini M; Vallier A; Gillet B; Hughes S; Balmand S; Vincent-Monégat C; Zaidman-Rémy A; Heddi A,17753,10.1073/pnas.2007151117,2020,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Absence,0.9750318,High (≥0.9),ML,0.519608551,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Absence,Absence,0.118768399,0.881231601,0.9750318,0.0249682,Absence,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain_Relevance,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Absence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Absence | ML | High (≥0.9)

ABS_070,B. Bock,9/23/2025,Irrelevant,ML,High,Nematodes,"One of the major limitations to enhance sustainability of crop production systems is the inability to control root-feeding nematodes without using chemical biocides. In soils under wild vegetation, however, root-feeding nematodes affect plant performance and plant community composition varying from substantially to insignificantly. Previous studies in natural ecosystems have already shown that mutualistic symbionts, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and endophytes, may influence plant exposure to root-feeding nematodes. In order to learn more from natural systems, we examined nematode control in the root zone of a wild coastal foredune grass by microorganisms, other nematodes and microarthropods. We cultured all eight root-feeding nematode species that occur in the root zone of marram grass (Ammophila arenaria) in coastal foredunes of the Netherlands. Then, in an indoor growth experiment we exposed each nematode species to the potential natural antagonists collected from the same dune soil. Most of the eight dominant root-feeding nematode species could be controlled to some extent by more than one group of soil organisms added. The effectiveness of control varied among nematode species, which seemed to be controlled in a species-specific way. We conclude that in a natural soil the effectiveness of control by microorganisms, other nematodes or microarthropods varies among root-feeding nematode species. Most are controlled, at least to some extent, by soil microbes. However, some root-feeding nematode species are controlled only by microarthropods. Our results strongly suggest that sustainable agriculture will benefit from using a range of biological control mechanisms when controlling root-feeding nematodes, rather than relying on single control agents. Our suggestion also implies that conserving soil biodiversity is crucial in order to enhance the reliability of biological crop protection against soil-borne pests and diseases.

In order to reduce the load of synthetic insecticides, ecofriendly alternative strategies are needed. The present studies were conducted to evaluate the insecticidal potential of the endophytic fungus Cladosporium uredinicola isolated from Tinospora cordifolia (Thunb.) on S. litura. Development of S. litura was significantly prolonged when larvae were fed on diet amended with ethyl acetate extract of C. uredinicola at concentrations of 1.25-2.00 mu l g(-1). The negative effects of fungal toxin on development of S. litura further resulted in a significant reduction in adult emergence, longevity and reproductive potential at higher concentrations. A significantly higher number of adults showed morphological deformities when larvae were fed on diet amended with 2.00 mu l g(-1) concentration. The inhibitory effects on growth and development of S. litura indicate toxicity of ethyl acetate extract of C. uredinicola, which is further evidenced by reduced food utilization by larvae. The antifeedant and toxic effects of ethyl acetate extract of C. uredinicola observed in the present studies can be attributed to a bioactive compound produced by the fungus, so this study provides evidence that C. uredinicola isolated from T. cordifolia possesses anti-insect properties and may play an important role in protecting plants against insect pests.","Insecticidal potential of an endophytic fungus, Cladosporium uredinicola, against Spodoptera litura","Thakur, A; Singh, V; Kaur, A; Kaur, S",8448,10.1007/s12600-013-0298-9,2013,PHYTOPARASITICA,Absence,0.80392523,Medium (0.7-0.9),ML,0.988565283,Relevant,Presence,Absence,Absence,Presence,0.80392523,0.19607477,0.00471762,0.99528238,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Absence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Absence | ML | Medium (0.7-0.9)

Methods and Results: Eight test fungi were isolated from the spoiled poultry feed. The endophytic fungus Calcarisporium sp. was separated from the Chinese coastal grass Cynodon dactylon. The antifungal action concerning the endophytic culture extract (ECE) was performed with propionic acid (PPA) as the corresponding reference. The ECE had a similar antifungal efficacy to PPA in a concentration-dependent manner. The susceptibility order of the ECE to the test fungi was found to be Fusarium sp. > Aspergillus spp. > Penicillium spp. Furthermore, the application of the ECE in pelleted-layer duck feed as a preservative was carried out at a humidity of 10, 15 and 20%. It has been discerned that mould growth and aflatoxin biosynthesis could be co-inhibited almost completely by ECE at concentrations higher than 1.0% (w/w). The LD50 of the ECE on mice was shown to be higher than 28 g kg(-1). Conclusions: The ECE can be selected as an inhibitor to preserve poultry feed on inhibiting the growth of mould and aflatoxin biosynthesis during feed storage.

ABS_080,B. Bock,9/23/2025,Presence,ML,High,,By analyzing the structural characteristics of endophytic fungi and bacteria in the stalks of sugarcane varieties resistant to ratoon stunting disease（RSD），the aim is to understand the roles of endophytic fungi and bacteria in the resistance of sugarcane，so as to provide theoretical basis for ecological control of RSD. Using Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing method，the communities，diversity index，and differences of endophytic bacteria and fungi between susceptible variety YT60 and resistant variety HoCP95988 were compared. The Alpha diversity indexes of endophytic fungi and bacteria in the stalks of susceptible cultivar YT60 was higher than that of resistant cultivar HoCP95988，indicating more species composition. The endophytic bacteria mainly distributed in Proteobacteria，while Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant phyla of endophytic fungi. The species compositions of 34 genera in 4 phyla Planctomycetes，Chloroflexi，Gemmatimonadetes，and Tenericutes between susceptible and resistant varieties were significantly different. Among them，the relative abundance of different species was higher in susceptible variety YT60. The diversity of endophytic fungal and bacterial communities in the stalks of sugarcane varieties resistant to RSD were relatively rich，and there were significant differences in the composition. Meanwhile，the classification information of different species provided clues to explore the biocontrol microbial resources for control RSD. © 2022 The Editorial Office of Biotechnology Bulletin.

The results of isolation and taxa analysis of endophytic fungi from sandal showed that 325 strains of endophytic fungi belonging to 16 genera of endophytic fungi were isolated from sandal (of which 86 from roots, 105 from stems and 134 from leaves). The isolation rate and colonization rate of endophytic fungi in different sandal parts showed the same pattern of change: leave>stems>roots. The diversity index of endophytic fungi in sandal roots was significantly higher than that of stems and leaves. The dominant endophytic fungi of sandal roots, stems and leaves showed significant differences. The dominant endophytic fungi of roots were Fusarium (50.00%) and Alternaria (10.47%), Alternaria (58.11%) and Acremonium (20.00%) for stems, and Pantoea (74.63%) for leaves. The antibacterial activity of 40 representative strains of sandal endophytic fungi were analyzed and the results showed that 90% of endophytic fungi exhibited inhibitory activity against at least one of the tested bacteria strains, and the strains with inhibitory activity to Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilis accounted for 45.0%, 30%, 47.5%, 55%, 72.5%, and 62.5%, respectively. The sandal fungal endophytes with plant growth-promoting characteristics were screened, and 5 strains of endophytic fungi with phosphorus-solubilizing activity, 8 strains of endophytic fungi producing IAA, and 4 strains of endophytic fungi producing siderophores were found. Among them, endophytic fungus Monilia sp TXRF45 clould produced IAA and siderophores, and also show phosphate-solubilizing activity. The results indicated that the endophytic fungi of Sandal were rich in species diversity and their distribution had a certain tissue specificity. Some strains showed good antibacterial activity and growth-promoting properties, which could potentially applicable for the development of antibacterial substances and rapid cultivation of sandal. © 2018, Editorial Board of China Journal of Chinese Materia Medica.

Nevertheless, there is a need to reexamine species delimitation in the Gloriosa taxa as most of the species have been synonymised as G. superba. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate the vegetative anatomical traits of G. superba. The leaf, scale leaf, tendril, stem, tuber, and roots of G. superba were freehand sectioned and stained with various staining solutions to record the anatomical structures. The cellular dimensions of each plant part were measured. The present study revealed the presence of intercostal and costal regions in the leaf epidermis, anomocytic stomata on abaxial surface, uniseriate epidermis covered by cuticle, undifferentiated mesophyll, and a bundle sheath surrounding vascular bundles in a leaf. Unlike the leaf, the scale leaf contains air chambers in the mesophyll region and bundle sheath is absent. The tendril had uniseriate cuticularized epidermis followed by few layers of cells developing wall thickenings, and collateral vascular bundles. The mature stem is differentiated from the young stem by the presence of bi-layered epidermis, the absence of stomata on the stem surface, and chlorenchymatous hypodermis.

Maize seedlings (var. Nithyashree) were inoculated with conidial suspensions and were examined for endophytic establishment in leaf and stems at different intervals during 15-90 days after treatment. All six isolates showed colonization in stem and leaf tissues with varying abilities of colonization and persistence. The mean percent colonization ranged from 7.41 to 20.37 % in older stem tissues and 3.70 to 21.29 % in young stem tissues and in leaf, it ranged from 6.46 to 27.78 % in older leaf tissues and 11.11 to 26.85 % in young leaf tissues. Among six isolates tested, Bb-23 isolate recorded the maximum mean colonization in older stem (20.37 %), older leaf (27.78 %) and in young stem (21.29 %).

ABS_084,B. Bock,9/23/2025,Presence,ML,High,,"There is interest in studying microbes that colonize maize silks (style tissue, critical for reproduction) including the fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum (Fg) and its interactions with the microbiome and biocontrol agents. In planta imaging of these interactions on living silks using confocal fluorescence microscopy would provide key insights. However, newly discovered microbes have unknown effects on human health, and there are regulatory requirements to prevent the release of fluorescently tagged microbes into the environment. Therefore, the microbe infection, colonization, and interaction stages on silks prior to microscopy must be contained. At the same time, silk viability must be maintained and experiments conducted that are biologically relevant (e.g. silks should remain attached to the cob), yet the silk tissue must be accessible to the researcher (i.e. not within husk leaves) and allow for multiple replicates. Here we present methods that meet these five contrasting criteria. We tested these methods using Fg and four silk-derived bacterial endophytes. The endophytes were previously known to have anti-Fg activity in vitro, but in planta observations were lacking. In Method 1, a portion of the tip of a cob was dissected, and silks remained attached to the cob in a Petri dish. The cob was placed on a water agar disc to maintain hydration. DsRed-tagged bacteria and GFP-tagged Fg were inoculated onto the silks and incubated, allowing the two microbes to grow towards one another before staining with propidium iodide for confocal microscopy. A variation of the protocol was presented in Method 2, where detached silk segments were placed directly on water agar where they were inoculated with bacteria and Fg to promote dense colonization, and to allow for many replicates and interventions such as silk wounding. The bacterial endophytes were successfully observed colonizing Fg hyphae, silk trichomes, and entering silks via cut ends and wounds. These protocols can be used to study other silk-associated microbes including several globally important fungal pathogens that enter maize grain through silks.",Protocols to enable fluorescence microscopy of microbial interactions on living maize silks (style tissue),"Thompson, MEH; Raizada, MN",5867,10.1016/j.mimet.2024.107027,2024,JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGICAL METHODS,Absence,0.453097438,Very Low (<0.5),ML,0.986430691,Relevant,Absence,Absence,Absence,Absence,0.453097438,0.546902562,0.009854428,0.990145572,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Absence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Absence | ML | Very Low (<0.5)

Methods and results: Fermentation of the isolated strain was done on five media. The derived extracts were investigated for their inhibitory activities against three human cancer cell lines; mammary gland breast cancer (MCF-7), colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) using MTT Assay. The fungal mycelia fermented in Modified Potato Dextrose Broth (MPDB) was the most cytotoxic extract against HepG2, MCF-7, and Caco-2 cell lines with IC50 4.2 ± 0.13, 5.9 ± 0.013 and 7.3 ± 0.004 μg mL−1, respectively. MPDB extract was scaled up resulting in the isolation of six metabolites; three fatty acids (1, 2, and 4), one sterol (3) and two butenolides (5 and 6) by column chromatography. The isolated compounds (1–6) were screened through a molecular docking approach for their binding aptitude to various active sites. butyrolactone-I (5) revealed a significant interaction within the CDK2 active site, while aspulvinone E (6) showed promising binding affinity to FLT3 and EGFR active sites that was confirmed by in vitro CDK2, FLT3 and EGFR inhibitory activity. Finally, the in vitro cytotoxic activities of butyrolactone-I (5) and aspulvinone E (6) revealed the antiproliferative activity of butyrolactone-I (5), against HepG2 cell line (IC50 = 17.85 ± 0.32 μM). Conclusion: Molecular docking analysis and in vitro assays suggested the CDK2/A2 inhibitory potential of butyrolactone-I (5) in addition to the promising interaction abilities of aspulvinone E (6) with EGFR and FLT3 active sites as a possible mechanism of their biological activities. © The Author(s) 2023.

The biological control of soilbome pathogens with microbial antagonists is gaining popularity in the crop protection system, due to the adverse effects of chemicals. In this study 40 isolates of fluorescent Pseudomonas were isolated from roots, shoots and leaves of Salvadora persica L. and S. oleoides Decne. Most of them showed strong suppressive effect on root rotting fungi Macrophomina phaseolina, Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium solani and F. oxysporum In vitro. Significant nematicidal activity against root knot nematode (Meloidogyne javanica) was also observed by the cellfree culture filtrates of these isolates. Identification of six potential isolates was confirmed by using molecular biology tools. Out of which 3 were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, one each as P. putida and P. monteilii, while one appeared as uncultured Pseudomonas. Experiments conducted on sunflower both in clay pots and field plots, test isolates of endophytic Pseudomonas were found effective in suppressing the root rot disease with improved plant growth as compared to untreated control.

As Butia archeri, a palm species endemic to the Cerrado savanna, is resistant to acidic soils and high concentrations of iron and aluminum, we decided to test the hypothesis that the endophyte and rhizosphere communities associated with this plant comprise microbiota rich in functional traits. To test this hypothesis, we isolated the cultivable radicular (endophytic) and rhizospheric microbiota of this palm and evaluated the capacity of the isolates to solubilize calcium (CaHPO4) and iron (FePO4) phosphates, synthesize indole acetic acid (IAA), and suppress the development of Aspergillus niger, the principal fungus known to deteriorate the seeds of this species. In total, 115 symbiotic bacterial and 17 fungal lineages were isolated, together with 40 seed-degrading fungi, primarily A. niger. The seed-deteriorating fungi presented a higher diversity index (H= 1.82) than the other groups analyzed. Moreover, we confirmed the hypothesis that the microbiota associated with B. archeri has functional traits that contribute to plant growth. The BA81RB isolate of the bacterium Bacillus cereus solubilized 570.4 mg L-1 CaHPO4 and 750.2 mg L-1 FePO4. Furthermore, two isolates also solubilized remarkable amounts of CaHPO4, with the BA367EF and BA99RF lineages of Stagonosporopsis cucurbitacearum and Bionectria ochroleuca solubilizing 798.90 and 493.20 mg L-1 phosphorous, respectively. Additionally, we confirmed the presence of isolates that synthesized high concentrations of IAA, such as the BA147RB lineage of Enterobacter sp., which synthesized 97.0 mu g mL(-1), and others with potential for suppression of A. niger (BA68EB of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and BA89RB of B. cereus). The present study provides novel insights into the symbiotic microorganisms associated with B. archeri, and reveals potentially important perspectives for the application of these isolates as promoters of plant growth, in particular for crops cultivated on the soils of the Cerrado biome.","ENDOPHYTIC RADICULAR AND RHIZOSPHERIC MICROBIOTA ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENDEMIC CERRADO PALM, BUTIA ARCHERI","Da Silva, CF; Vitorino, LC; Pinheiro, LC; De Siqueira, KA; Soares, MA; Souchie, EL",3617,10.30848/PJB2021-4(23),2021,PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,Absence,0.20323298,Very Low (<0.5),ML,0.953256131,Relevant,Absence,Absence,Absence,Absence,0.20323298,0.79676702,0.080284521,0.919715479,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Absence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Absence | ML | Very Low (<0.5)

This aphid is widely distributed in Australia and New Zealand on the roots of the common forage grasses, ryegrass (Lolium spp.) and tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix) where it exists as permanent, anholocyclic, parthenogenetic populations. Previous studies have indicated that infestations of A. lentisci significantly reduce plant growth and may account for differences in field performance of Lolium perenne infected with different strains of the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae var. lolii. These obligate biotrophs protect their host grasses from herbivory via the production of alkaloids. To confirm the hypothesis that growth of L. perenhe is associated with the effect of different endophyte strains on aphid populations, herbage and root growth were measured over time in two pot trials that compared three fungal endophyte strains with an endophyte-free control. In both pot trials, aphid numbers were lowest on plants infected with endophyte strain AR37 at all sampling times. In plants infected with a common toxic strain naturalized in New Zealand, aphid numbers overall were lower than on uninfected plants or those infected with strain AR1, but numbers did not always differ significantly from these treatments. Populations on AR1-infected plants were occasionally significantly higher than those on endophyte-free. Cumulative foliar growth was reduced in AR1 and Nil treatments relative to AR37 in association with population differences of A. lentisci in both trials and root dry weight was reduced in one trial. In four Petri dish experiments survival of A. lentisci on plants infected with AR37 declined to low levels after an initial phase of up to 19 days during which time aphids fed and populations were similar to those on plants without endophyte. Aphids on AR37-infected plants became uncoordinated in their movement and developed tremors before dying suggesting a neurotoxin was responsible for their mortality.

Bock,9/23/2025,Both,String,High,,"Both endophytic and mycorrhizal fungi interact with plants to form symbiosis in which the fungal partners rely on, and sometimes compete for, carbon (C) sources from their hosts. Changes in photosynthesis in host plants caused by atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment may, therefore, influence those mutualistic interactions, potentially modifying plant nutrient acquisition and interactions with other coexisting plant species. However, few studies have so far examined the interactive controls of endophytes and mycorrhizae over plant responses to atmospheric CO2 enrichment. Using Festuca arundinacea Schreb and Plantago lanceolata L. as model plants, we examined the effects of elevated CO2 on mycorrhizae and endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum) and plant nitrogen (N) acquisition in two microcosm experiments, and determined whether and how mycorrhizae and endophytes mediate interactions between their host plant species. Endophyte-free and endophyte-infected F. arundinacea varieties, P. lanceolata L., and their combination with or without mycorrhizal inocula were grown under ambient (400 mu mol mol(-1)) and elevated CO2 (ambient + 330 mu mol mol(-1)). A N-15 isotope tracer was used to quantify the mycorrhiza-mediated plant acquisition of N from soil. Elevated CO2 stimulated the growth of P. lanceolata greater than F. arundinacea, increasing the shoot biomass ratio of P. lanceolata to F. arundinacea in all the mixtures. Elevated CO2 also increased mycorrhizal root colonization of P. lanceolata, but had no impact on that of F. arundinacea. Mycorrhizae increased the shoot biomass ratio of P. lanceolata to F. arundinacea under elevated CO2. In the absence of endophytes, both elevated CO2 and mycorrhizae enhanced N-15 and total N uptake of P. lanceolata but had either no or even negative effects on N acquisition of F. arundinacea, altering N distribution between these two species in the mixture. The presence of endophytes in F. arundinacea, however, reduced the CO2 effect on N acquisition in P. lanceolata, although it did not affect growth responses of their host plants to elevated CO2.

We collected weevils as they died and dissected them to assess the development of parasitoids. Emergence of prepupae from hosts and survival to adulthood were also recorded. Fungal isolates did not differ in their influence on weevil feeding or survival. In contrast, the effect of the endophyte on the parasitoid varied among isolates of the fungus. Isolates ARW and AR6 reduced parasitoid adult emergence relative to nit endophyte. In contrast, AR37 had no negative effect on survival of the parasitoid. Furthermore, an index of developmental rate showed that parasitoids developed more slowly when reared from hosts fed grass containing any of the strains of N. lolii, except AR37, compared to endophyte-free grass.

ABS_098,B. Bock,9/23/2025,Both,String,High,,"Mutualisms between fungal endophytes and forage grasses can exert broad-reaching effects on grassland communities and ecosystem processes. We hypothesised that endophytes of grasses would retard the process of faecal degradation since grazing animals consume primarily live plant material and excrete a large portion of the herbage they consume as faeces. We examined the degradation rates of faeces from sheep that had consumed pure swards of perennial ryegrass containing a range of unique strains (AR1, AR37, or Wild type) of the fungal endophyte, Neotyphodium lolii, or no endophyte. Ultimately, the presence of endophytes in perennial ryegrass resulted in slower faecal decay rates compared to the nil endophyte treatment, although only consistently for the C concentration decay rates that were approximately 2x to 4x slower in the endophyte-derived faecal matter. The decay rate of dry matter content was significantly slower (ca. 1.5x) in the novel endophyte-derived faeces (AR1 and AR37) compared to the nil endophyte-derived faeces. The N decay rates differed significantly only in the AR1 treatment that was approximately 4x slower than the nil endophyte group. The reduced decay rates are attributed to the presence of endophyte-derived alkaloids in the faeces, and a greater proportion of more easily degraded hemicellulose in faeces from sheep that consumed the endophyte-free grass. There were no significant differences in the faecal carbon and nitrogen decay rates among the three endophyte strain treatments. This suggests that all the strain-specific alkaloids might have similar effects, or that N. lolii has a general effect that is not strain-specific, such as altered fibre composition, as reported here. This is the first report of a fungal endophyte affecting the rate of faecal degradation, and the first report of the alkaloids peramine, lolitrem B and epoxy-janthitrems in faecal matter.

Deterioration of endophyte-free plots relative to endophyte-infected plots had been observed. In Trial A, pasture mealybug were sampled in plots of the perennial ryegrass cultivar 'Grasslands Nui', without endophyte (nil), or infected with the wild-type endophyte, or the selected strains, AR1 and AR37. In Trial B, mealybug numbers on six ryegrass cultivars infected with AR1 or wild-type were compared with those on the same cultivars without endophyte. In sampling these trials, the presence of a root aphid, Aploneura lentisci, was also noted. Populations of mealybug in both trials were similar on all endophyte-infected treatments and significantly lower than populations on nil treatments. Neither AR1 nor wild-type appeared to reduce root aphid numbers, while AR37 may have had some effect. The amount of dead grass was significantly greater in nil than in endophyte-infected plots in Trial A, and yield of ryegrass was correlated with numbers of mealybug and root aphid present. Pasture productivity in nil treatments had recovered by spring, in the year of the outbreak. The presence of endophyte, strain of endophyte and cultivar were all significant factors affecting both total dry matter and green yield in Trial B. Pasture mealybug accounted for 55% of the variation in a decline in growth rate that occurred in this trial over the summer-autumn periods between 2000 and 200 1, particularly in the nil treatments. Two years after the outbreak there was 25% less ryegrass and persistently lower pasture yields in nil plots.

ABS_101,B. Bock,9/23/2025,Both,String,High,,"It is increasingly recognized that macro-organisms (corals, insects, plants, vertebrates) consist of both host tissues and multiple microbial symbionts that play essential roles in their host's ecological and evolutionary success. Consequently, identifying benefits and costs of symbioses, as well as mechanisms underlying them are research priorities. All plants surveyed under natural conditions harbor foliar endophytic fungi (FEE) in their leaf tissues, often at high densities. Despite producing no visible effects on their hosts, experiments have nonetheless shown that FEE reduce pathogen and herbivore damage. Here, combining results from three genomic, and two physiological experiments, we demonstrate pervasive genetic and phenotypic effects of the apparently asymptomatic endophytes on their hosts. Specifically, inoculation of endophyte-free (E) Theobroma cacao leaves with Colletotrichum tropicale (E+), the dominant FEE species in healthy T cacao, induces consistent changes in the expression of hundreds of host genes, including many with known defensive functions. Further, E+ plants exhibited increased lignin and cellulose content, reduced maximum rates of photosynthesis (A(max)), and enrichment of nitrogen-15 and carbon-13 isotopes. These phenotypic changes observed in E+ plants correspond to changes in expression of specific functional genes in related pathways. Moreover, a cacao gene (Tc00g04254) highly up-regulated by C. tropicale also confers resistance to pathogen damage in the absence of endophytes or their products in host tissues. Thus, the benefits of increased pathogen resistance in E+ plants are derived in part from up-regulation of intrinsic host defense responses, and appear to be offset by potential costs including reduced photosynthesis, altered host nitrogen metabolism, and endophyte heterotrophy of host tissues. Similar effects are likely in most plant-endophyte interactions, and should be recognized in the design and interpretation of genetic and phenotypic studies of plants.",Pervasive effects of a dominant foliar endophytic fungus on host genetic and phenotypic expression in a tropical tree,"Mejía, LC; Herre, EA; Sparks, JP; Winter, K; García, MN; Van Bael, SA; Stitt, J; Zhang, Y; Zhang, YF; Guiltinan, MJ; Maximova, SN",8970,10.3389/fmicb.2014.00479,2014,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,Presence,0,Very Low (<0.5),String,0.558063508,NA,NA,NA,Presence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,Uncertain_Relevance,TRUE,6,3,endophyte-free; absence of endophytes,observed; surveyed,"genetic and phenotypic effects of the apparently asymptomatic endophytes on their hosts.
