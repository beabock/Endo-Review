=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===
1. WEIGHTED ENSEMBLE: Best overall performance (89.8% accuracy)
   - Use 'final_classification' column for primary results
   - Manually review 'Uncertain' classifications

2. CONSERVATIVE APPROACH: High-confidence classifications only
   - Use 'conservative_classification' column for minimal false positives
   - Larger proportion will need manual review

3. REVIEW PRIORITIES:
   - Manually review all 'Absence' classifications (avoid missing relevant studies)
   - Spot-check 'Presence' classifications for quality
   - Review 'Uncertain' cases based on available time
