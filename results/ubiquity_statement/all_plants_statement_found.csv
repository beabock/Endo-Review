21199,Chitinolytic activities of endophytic bacteria isolated from symptom-free Chinese cabbage leaves,"Virtually all plants are inhabited by endophytic microorganisms, often bacteria and fungi. Endophytes are ubiquitous colonizers of the inner plant tissues where they do not normally cause any substantial morphological changes and disease symptoms in contrast to phytopathogens. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial endophytes have been isolated from several tissues in numerous plant species. In this study, fourteen isolates of endophytic bacteria (M1ccl - M14ccl) isolated from leaves of symptom-free Chinese cabbage cv. Yamico were assayed for chitinase activities in fluorometric assay with 4-methylumbelliferyl substrates. The highest chitinase activity was given by the isolate M11ccl followed by the isolate M4ccl. The assay results of these two bacterial isolates were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulphate Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) activity gels. The chitinase isozyme patterns obtained for these two isolates were different from each other in their banding patterns in gels. No growth inhibition of Botrytis cinerea was obtained with the cell-free culture supernatants of M4ccl and M11ccl. © 2015 Global Science Publications.",NA,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
12689,Are tropical fungal endophytes hyperdiverse?,"Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous fungi that inhabit healthy plant tissues without causing disease. Endophytes have been found in every plant species examined to date and may be important, but often overlooked, components of fungal biodiversity. In two sites in a lowland, moist tropical forest of central Panama, we quantified endophyte colonization patterns, richness, host preference, and spatial variation in healthy leaves of two co-occurring, understory tree species [Heisteria concinna (Olacaceae) and Ouratea lucens (Ochnaceae)]. From 83 leaves, all of which were colonized by endophytes, we isolated 418 endophyte morphospecies (estimated 347 genetically distinct taxa), most of which were represented by only a single isolate (59%). Among morphospecies encountered in more than one leaf (nonsingletons), we found evidence of host preference and spatial heterogeneity using both morphospecies frequencies and presence/absence records. Based on these data, we postulate that tropical endophytes themselves may be hyperdiverse and suggest that extrapolative estimates that exclude them will markedly underestimate fungal species diversity.",10.1046/j.1461-0248.2000.00159.x,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
21272,Bioactive secondary metabolites and their exploitation in the pharmaceutical industry produced by endophytic fungi,"Historically, bioactive compounds produced by animals, plants and microorganisms have been a rich source of lead molecules in drug discovery. Plant and endophytic fungi are considered a source of a plethora of bioactive compounds with potential applications in the agriculture, pharmaceutical and food industry. Endophytic fungi are ubiquitous microorganisms living asymptomatically within the tissue of higher plants without causing any adverse effects or visible symptoms. In this scenario, fungal endophytic bioactive compounds have an important function to endorse plant growth through diverse mechanisms. They are equally important economically to humans by plating as antibiotics, drugs, medicines, compounds of high relevance in research, or compounds useful in the food industry. Many antibiotics such as ivermectin and validamycin and anti-cancerous compounds such as taxol, cytospolides Q, P, colletotriolide, mycoleptodiscin B etc. have been successfully isolated from endophytic fungi. This review will highlight the different fungal endophytic classes and their exolites for medicinal use and applications in pharmaceuticals. © 2021 World Research Association.

8106,Fungal root endophytes influence plants in a species-specific manner that depends on plant's growth stage,"The mycobiome (fungal microbiome) influences plants-from seed germination to full maturation. While many studies on fungal-plant interaction studies have focused on known mutualistic and pathogenic fungi, the functional role of ubiquitous endophytic fungi remains little explored. We examined how root-inhabiting fungi (endophytes) influence range-expanding plant species. We isolated endophytes from three European intra-continental range-expanders and three congenerics that are native both in the range expander's original (southern Europe) and new (northern Europe) range. To standardize our collection, endophytes were obtained from all six plant species growing under controlled conditions in northern (new range of the range expander) and southern (native range of the range expander) soils. We cultivated, molecularly identified and tested the effects of all isolates on seed germination, and growth of seedlings and older plants. Most of the 34 isolates could not be functionally characterized based on their taxonomic identity and literature information on functions. Endophytes affected plant growth in a plant species-endophyte-specific manner, but overall differed between range-expanders and natives. While endophytes reduced germination and growth of range-expanders compared to natives, they reduced seedling growth of natives more than of range-expanders. Synthesis. We conclude that endophytic fungi have a direct effect on plant growth in a plant growth stage-dependent manner. While these effects differed between range expanders and natives, the effect strength and significance varied among the plant genera included in the present study. Nevertheless, endophytes likely influence the establishment of newly arriving plants and influence vegetation dynamics.",10.1111/1365-2745.13584,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
17926,Nitrogen-fixing bacteria and Oxalis - evidence for a vertically inherited bacterial symbiosis.,"Plant-endophyte symbioses often revolve around nitrogen metabolism, and involve varying degrees of intimacy. Although evidence for vertical inheritance of nitrogen-fixing endophytic bacteria is increasing, it is confined mostly to crop plants, and to date no such system has been reported for geophytes. Bacterial endophytes associated with Oxalis, the most species-rich geophytic genus form the Cape Flora in southern Africa was studied. Culturable endophytes were isolated from surface-sterilized vegetative and reproductive plant organs for six host species at three locations. Colonies of microbes on various artificial media were morphotyped, enumerated and identified using sequence data. Filter exclusion experiments were conducted to determine if endophytes were vertically transmitted to seeds, determine if mucilage plays a role to actively attract microbes from the soil and to assess microbial richness isolated from the mucilage of Oxalis seedlings. Fluorescent microscopy was implemented in order to visualize endophytic bacteria in cryo-sectioned seeds. Evidence for a novel, vertically transmitted symbiosis was reported. Communities of nitrogen-fixing and plant growth-promoting Bacillus endophytes were found to associate with selected Oxalis hosts from nitrogen-deficient environments of the Cape. Bacillus endophytes were ubiquitous and diverse across species and plant bodies, and were prominent in seeds. Three common nitrogen-fixing Bacillus have known oxalotrophic properties and appear to be housed inside specialised cavities (containing oxalates) within the plant body and seeds. The discovery of vertical transmission and potential benefits to both host and endophyte suggest a particularly tight mutualism in the Oxalis-endophyte system. This discovery suggests unexpected ways in which geophytes might avoid nitrogen deficiency, and suggest that such symbioses are more common than previously expected.",10.1186/s12870-019-2049-7,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
15607,Diversity and communities of fungal endophytes from four pinus species in Korea,"Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous in nature. They are known as potential sources of natural products, and possible agents for biocontrol attributing to their ability to produce a repertoire of bioactive compounds. In this study, we isolated fungal endophytes from three different tissues (needle, stem and root) of four Pinus species (Pinus densiflora, Pinus koraiensis, Pnus rigida, and Pinus thunbergii) across 18 sampling sites in Korea. A total number of 5872 culturable fungal endophytes were isolated using standard culturing techniques. Molecular identification based on the sequence analyses of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) or 28S ribosomal DNA revealed a total of 234 different fungal species. The isolated fungal endophytes belonged to Ascomycota (91.06%), Basidio-mycota (5.95%) and Mucoromycota (2.97%), with 144 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 88 different genera. In all sampling sites, the highest species richness (S) was observed in site 1T (51 OTUs) while the lowest was observed in site 4T (27 OTUs). In terms of diversity, as measured by Shannon diversity index (H’), the sampling site 2D (H′ = 3.216) showed the highest while the lowest H’ was observed in site 2K (H’ = 2.232). Species richness (S) in three different tissues revealed that root and needle tissues are highly colonized with fungal endophytes compared to stem tissue. No significant difference was observed in the diversity of endophytes in three different tissues. Among the four Pinus species, P. thunbergii exhibited the highest species richness and diversity of fungal endophytes. Our findings also revealed that the environmental factors have no significant impact in shaping the composition of the fungal endophytes. Furthermore, FUNGuild analysis revealed three major classifications of fungal endophytes based on trophic modes namely saprotrophs, sym-biotrophs, and pathotrophs in four Pinus species, with high proportions of saprotrophs and pathothrops. © 2021 by the authors.

19264,Microbial Endophytes: Emerging Trends and Biotechnological Applications.,"A plethora of knowledge on the role of endophytic microorganisms has been reported in recent years. The cooperative chemistry between the endophytes and the internal host tissue has turned them into a crucial aid for biotechnological applications. Microbial endophytes are ubiquitous among most plant species on earth and contribute to the benefit of host plants by generating a wide range of metabolites that provide the plant with survival value. Endophytes can either directly stimulate plant growth by producing phytohormones or indirectly stimulate plant growth by increasing the availability of soil nutrients to plants. Endophytes may also help suppress diseases in plants directly by neutralizing environmental toxic elements, and by inhibiting plant pathogens by antagonistic action, or indirectly by stimulating induced plant systemic resistance. Several natural compounds produced by endophytes as secondary metabolites are beneficial to both plants and humans. This is why endophytes are regarded as a significant source of novel natural products of value in modern medicine, agriculture, and industry. Endophytes are known for producing pigments, bioactive compounds, and industrially important enzymes, like glucanase, amylase, laccase, etc. Some endophytes can also produce nanoparticles that potentially have numerous applications in a variety of fields. They also play an important role in biodegradation and bioremediation, both of which are beneficial to the environment and ecology. In this review, we highlighted potential biotechnological applications of endophytic microbes, as well as their diverse importance in plant growth and public health.",10.1007/s00284-023-03349-2,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
9136,Invisible but consequential: root endophytic fungi have variable effects on belowground plant-insect interactions,"Endophytic fungi are ubiquitous in nature and can play important roles in regulating plantherbivore interactions. While some aboveground obligate symbionts are considered defensive mutualists of host plants, the importance of root endophytes in plant defense, especially against root-feeding insects, remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of root fungal endophytes on plant resistance against belowground herbivores and the recovery of host plants from damage. We grew the common grass Festuca arundinacea (tall fescue) semi-aeroponically in the laboratory and inoculated roots with one of five fungal endophytes isolated from field-collected tall fescue or meadow soil. Endophyte-inoculated and uninoculated control plants were subjected to feeding by larvae of the generalist root herbivore Rhizotrogus majalis (European chafer). Herbivory intensity was quantified after eight days, and regrowth of roots and shoots following root herbivory and mechanical shoot damage was measured thereafter for each treatment. Fungal identifications by DNA sequence analysis were conducted after completion of the herbivory experiments and revealed that the five endophytes included the decomposer fungi Trametes versicolor and Mortierella alpina, the entomopathogenic fungi Isaria fumosorosea and Beauveria bassiana, and a potential plant pathogen/entomopathogen Fusarium cf. equiseti. The effects of these root endophytes on plant defense against root-feeding insects were species-specific. While four endophytes had few effects on plant resistance, endophytic B. bassiana significantly reduced herbivore damage to roots. In comparison, plant tolerance to damage was impaired after colonization by all endophyte species except T. versicolor and M. alpina. The contrasting effects of endophytes on plant resistance and plant tolerance suggest that research solely evaluating plant resistance is likely to overestimate the benefits conferred by endophytes without accounting for potential negative effects on plant tolerance. We propose a conceptual framework to include both plant resistance and tolerance as two dimensions of a defensive strategy and show that plant associations with different root endophytes may shift the relative importance of resistance and tolerance for plant defense.",10.1002/ecs2.1710,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
21214,Diversity and antimicrobial activity of endophytic fungi from traditional medicinal plant Curcuma wenyujin,"Endophytic fungi are ubiquitous in plants and reside their hosts for a part of their life cycle. Their various diversity associated with the potential bioactivity has played an important role in human health, especially that from Chinese traditional medicinal herbs. Here, we isolated endophytic fungi from plant Curcuma wenyujin and evaluated their antimicrobial activity. Sixty-six endophytic fungi were recovered from the fresh and healthy root, leaf and stem tissues of C. wenyujin. Of these isolates, the common species Penicillium, Fusarium and Aspergillus were the dominant species. 65% of endophytic fungi had the potential antibacterial activity against one or more tested microorganism of E. coli, P. vulgaris, B. subtilis, S. aureus, Rhizopus, Microzyme, A. niger and Mucor, and 4.5% strains could inhibit eight tested microbes, exhibiting a broad antimicrobial spectrum.

11766,Does a foliar endophyte improve plant fitness under flooding?,"Although endophytic fungi are ubiquitous in plants, their full range of ecological effects has yet to be characterized, particularly in non-agronomic systems. In this study, we compared the responses of two congeneric bluegrass species to flooding. Both plant species co-occur in subalpine zones of the Rocky Mountains. Marsh bluegrass (Poa leptocoma) commonly hosts a vertically transmitted fungal endophyte (EpichloA << sp.) and naturally grows in wetter conditions than does nodding bluegrass (Poa reflexa), which lacks an epichloid endophyte. We investigated the novel hypothesis that endophyte symbiosis promotes host fitness under flooded conditions, contributing to niche differentiation between the two bluegrass species. We used a factorial greenhouse experiment to test whether endophyte presence improved survival, growth, or reproduction of P. leptocoma under flooded versus non-flooded edaphic conditions by experimentally removing the endophyte from half of the plants. We compared P. leptocoma responses to those of the endophyte-free congener. In contrast to expectations generated from the natural distributions of the two plant species, endophyte presence was more beneficial to P. leptocoma under ambient soil moisture than under flooding. Increased benefits of symbiosis in drier soils are consistent with studies of other grass endophytes. Flooded soils also unexpectedly improved the growth of P. reflexa more than that of the wet habitat specialist, P. leptocoma. While our results demonstrate an overall benefit of fungal symbiosis in this system, ecological factors other than flooding per se likely underlie the observed geographical distributions of these congeneric grasses in nature.",10.1007/s11258-017-0723-0,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
18563,Potential of Endophytic Bacterium Paenibacillus sp. PHE-3 Isolated from Plantago asiatica L. for Reduction of PAH Contamination in Plant Tissues.,"Endophytes are ubiquitous in plants, and they may have a natural capacity to biodegrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In our study, a phenanthrene-degrading endophytic Paenibacillus sp. PHE-3 was isolated from P. asiatica L. grown in a PAH-contaminated site. The effects of environmental variables on phenanthrene biodegradation by strain PHE-3 were studied, and the ability of strain PHE-3 to use high molecular weight PAH (HMW-PAH) as a sole carbon source was also evaluated. Our results indicated that pH value of 4.0-8.0, temperature of 30 °C-42 °C, initial phenanthrene concentration less than 100 mg·L(-1), and some additional nutrients are favorable for the biodegradation of phenanthrene by strain PHE-3. The maximum biodegradation efficiency of phenanthrene was achieved at 99.9% after 84 h cultivation with additional glutamate. Moreover, the phenanthrene biodegradation by strain PHE-3 was positively correlated with the catechol 2,3-dioxygenase activity (ρ = 0.981, p < 0.05), suggesting that strain PHE-3 had the capability of degrading HMW-PAHs. In the presence of other 2-, 3-ringed PAHs, strain PHE-3 effectively degraded HMW-PAHs through co-metabolism. The results of this study are beneficial in that the re-colonization potential and PAH degradation performance of endophytic Paenibacillus sp. PHE-3 may be applied towards reducing PAH contamination in plants.",10.3390/ijerph13070633,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
2365,Host Specificity and Seasonal Variation in the Colonization of Tubakia sensu lato Associated with Evergreen Oak Species in Eastern Japan,"Foliar fungal endophytes are ubiquitous and hyperdiverse, and tend to be host-specific among dominant forest tree species. The fungal genus Tubakia sensu lato is comprised of foliar pathogens and endophytes that exhibit host preference for Quercus and other Fagaceae species. To clarify interspecific differences in ecological characteristics among Tubakia species, we examined the endophyte communities of seven evergreen Quercus spp. at three sites in eastern Japan during summer and winter. Host tree species was the most significant factor affecting endophyte community composition. Tubakia species found at the study sites were divided into five specialists and three generalists according to their relative abundance in each host species and their host ranges. Specialists were dominant on their own host in summer, and their abundance declined in winter. To test the hypothesis that generalists are more widely adapted to their environment than specialists, we compared their spore germination rates at different temperatures. Spores of generalist Tubakia species were more tolerant of colder temperatures than were spores of specialist Tubakia species, supporting our hypothesis. Seasonal and site variations among Tubakia species were also consistent with our hypothesis. Host identity and ecology were significantly associated with endophyte community structure.",10.1007/s00248-022-02067-9,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
19666,Seed Treatment With Systemic Fungicides: Time for Review.,"Pre-sowing seed treatment with systemic fungicides is a firmly entrenched practice for most agricultural crops worldwide. The treatment is intended to protect the crop against seed- and soil-borne diseases. In recent years, there is increasing evidence that fungicidal applications to manage diseases might inadvertently also affect non-target organisms, such as endophytes. Endophytes are ubiquitously present in plants and contribute to plant growth and development besides offering resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. In seeds, endophytes may play a role in seed development, seed germination, seedling establishment and crop performance. In this paper, we review the recent literature on non-target effects of fungicidal applications on endophytic fungal community and discuss the possible consequences of indiscriminate seed treatment with systemic fungicide on seed endophytes. It is now well recognized that endophytes are ubiquitously present in all parts of the plant, including the seeds. They may be transmitted vertically from seed to seed as in many grasses and/or acquired horizontally from the soil and the environment. Though the origins and evolution of these organisms in plants are a matter of conjecture, numerous studies have shown that they symbiotically aid in plant growth and development, in nutrient acquisition as well in protecting the plants from abiotic and biotic stresses. Against this background, it is reasonable to assume that the use of systemic fungicides in seed treatment may not only affect the seed endophytes but also their attendant benefits to seedling growth and establishment. While there is evidence to indicate that fungicidal applications to manage plant diseases also affect foliar endophytes, there are only few studies that have documented the effect of seed treatment on seed-borne endophytes. Some of the convincing examples of the latter come from studies on the effect of fungicide application on rye grass seed endophyte AR37. More recently, experiments have shown that removal of seed endophytes by treatment with systemic fungicides leads to significant loss of seedling vigour and that such losses could be partially restored by enriching the seedlings with the lost endophytes. Put together, these studies reinforce the importance of seed endophytes to seedling growth and establishment and draw attention on how to trade the balance between the benefits of seed treatments and the direct and indirect costs incurred due to loss of endophytes. Among several approaches, use of reduced-risk fungicides and identifying fungicide-resistant endophytes are suggested to sustain the endophyte contribution to early seedling growth.",10.3389/fpls.2021.654512,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
17736,Biocontrol arsenals of bacterial endophyte: An imminent triumph against clubroot disease.,"Clubroot disease caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae is an obligate, biotrophic pathogen, sabotages various pathways in host plant, causes root infection and impedes growth and known as the greatest threat to cruciferous crop production worldwide. Various control measures such as genetic resistance, application of chemical compounds and biological fungicides and other cultural practices have not been fruitful. Biological control based upon the idea of implying nature to work for nature, is sound. Endophytes are ubiquitous to kingdom planta thus plant-endophyte association is intimate and dynamic. Bacterial endophytes offer many benefits to plant by acting as growth promoters and disease defenders. Endophyte-mediated biocontrol is achieved by exclusion of pathogen via niche and nutrient competition, by producing anti-microbial compounds and inducing host defense responses. Many rhizobacteria and some endophytes have been tested for clubroot control. In this review, efforts are made to summarize recent developments in biocontrol through endophytes, with latest improvements in biocontrol of clubroot disease are focused specifically.",10.1016/j.micres.2020.126565,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
12661,Acid protease production in fungal root endophytes,"Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous in healthy root tissue, but little is known about their ecosystem functions, including their ability to utilize organic nutrient sources such as proteins. Root-associated fungi may secrete proteases to access the carbon and mineral nutrients within proteins in the soil or in the cells of their plant host. We compared the protein utilization patterns of multiple isolates of the root endophytes Phialocephala fortinii s.1., Meliniomyces variabilis and Umbelopsis isabellina with those of two ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi, Hebeloma incarnatulum and Laccaria bicolor, and the wood-decay fungus Irpex lacteus at pH values of 2-9 on liquid BSA media. We also assessed protease activity using a fluorescently labeled casein assay and gelatin zymography and characterized proteases using specific protease inhibitors. I. lacteus and U. isabellina utilized protein efficiently, while the ECM fungi exhibited poor protein utilization. ECM fungi secreted metallo-proteases and had pH optima above 4, while other fungi produced aspartic proteases with lower pH optima. The ascomycetous root endophytes M. variabilis and P. fortinii exhibited intermediate levels of protein utilization and M. variabilis exhibited a very low pH optimum.

19456,Microbial endophytes: application towards sustainable agriculture and food security.,"Microbial endophytes are ubiquitous and exist in each recognised plant species reported till date. Within the host plant, the entire community of microbes lives non-invasively within the active internal tissues without causing any harm to the plant. Endophytes interact with their host plant via metabolic communication enables them to generate signal molecules. In addition, the host plant's genetic recombination with endophytes helps them to imitate the host's physicochemical functions and develop identical active molecules. Therefore, when cultured separately, they begin producing the host plant phytochemicals. The fungal species Penicillium chrysogenum has portrayed the glory days of antibiotics with the invention of the antibiotic penicillin. Therefore, fungi have substantially supported social health by developing many bioactive molecules utilised as antioxidant, antibacterial, antiviral, immunomodulatory and anticancerous agents. But plant-related microbes have emanated as fountainheads of biologically functional compounds with higher levels of medicinal perspective in recent years. Researchers have been motivated by the endless need for potent drugs to investigate alternate ways to find new endophytes and bioactive molecules, which tend to be a probable aim for drug discovery. The current research trends with these promising endophytic organisms are reviewed in this review paper. KEY POINTS: • Identified 54 important bioactive compounds as agricultural relevance • Role of genome mining of endophytes and ""Multi-Omics"" tools in sustainable agriculture • A thorough description and graphical presentation of agricultural significance of plant endophytes.",10.1007/s00253-022-12078-8,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
11921,A Phylogenetic Estimation of Trophic Transition Networks for Ascomycetous Fungi: Are Lichens Cradles of Symbiotrophic Fungal Diversification?,"Fungi associated with photosynthetic organisms are major determinants of terrestrial biomass, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem productivity from the poles to the equator. Whereas most fungi are known because of their fruit bodies (e.g., saprotrophs), symptoms (e.g., pathogens), or emergent properties as symbionts (e.g., lichens), the majority of fungal diversity is thought to occur among species that rarely manifest their presence with visual cues on their substrate (e.g., the apparently hyperdiverse fungal endophytes associated with foliage of plants). Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous among all lineages of land plants and live within overtly healthy tissues without causing disease, but the evolutionary origins of these highly diverse symbionts have not been explored. Here, we show that a key to understanding both the evolution of endophytism and the diversification of the most species-rich phylum of Fungi (Ascomycota) lies in endophyte-like fungi that can be isolated from the interior of apparently healthy lichens. These ""endolichenic"" fungi are distinct from lichen mycobionts or any other previously recognized fungal associates of lichens, represent the same major lineages of Ascomycota as do endophytes, largely parallel the high diversity of endophytes from the arctic to the tropics, and preferentially associate with green algal photobionts in lichen thalli. Using phylogenetic analyses that incorporate these newly recovered fungi and ancestral state reconstructions that take into account phylogenetic uncertainty, we show that endolichenism is an incubator for the evolution of endophytism. In turn, endophytism is evolutionarily transient, with endophytic lineages frequently transitioning to and from pathogenicity. Although symbiotrophic lineages frequently give rise to free-living saprotrophs, reversions to symbiosis are rare. Together, these results provide the basis for estimating trophic transition networks in the Ascomycota and provide a first set of hypotheses regarding the evolution of symbiotrophy and saprotrophy in the most species-rich fungal phylum.

260,The foliar endophytic fungal community composition in Cirsium arvense is affected by mycorrhizal colonization and soil nutrient content,"Foliar fungal endophytes are ubiquitous, but understudied symbionts of most plant species; relatively little is known about the factors affecting their occurrence, diversity and abundance. We tested the effects of soil nutrient content and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization on the occurrence of foliar endophytic fungi in Cirsium arvense in two field studies. In the first study, we assessed relationships between soil moisture, organic matter, carbon and nitrogen content and plant water, nitrogen and carbon content and AM colonization and the occurrence of foliar endophytic fungal species. In the second study, we manipulated soil nutrient content and AM colonization of potted seedlings and identified differences in endophytic fungal species composition of the leaves and stems. The results reveal that endophytes can occur either more or less frequently, de-pending on soil nutrient and plant water content and AM colonization. We propose that these patterns were the result of differences in fungal growth responses to nutrient availability in the leaves, which can be affected by resources obtained from the soil or symbiotic fungi in the roots.

1885,"Culturable fungal endophyte communities of primary successional plants on Mount St. Helens, WA, USA","Background While a considerable amount of research has explored plant community composition in primary successional systems, little is known about the microbial communities inhabiting these pioneer plant species. Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous within plants, and may play major roles in early successional ecosystems. Specifically, endophytes have been shown to affect successional processes, as well as alter host stress tolerance and litter decomposition dynamics-both of which are important components in harsh environments where soil organic matter is still scarce. Results To determine possible contributions of fungal endophytes to plant colonization patterns, we surveyed six of the most common woody species on the Pumice Plain of Mount St. Helens (WA, USA; Lawetlat'la in the Cowlitz language; created during the 1980 eruption)-a model primary successional ecosystem-and found low colonization rates (< 15%), low species richness, and low diversity. Furthermore, while endophyte community composition did differ among woody species, we found only marginal evidence of temporal changes in community composition over a single field season (July-September). Conclusions Our results indicate that even after a post-eruption period of 40 years, foliar endophyte communities still seem to be in the early stages of community development, and that the dominant pioneer riparian species Sitka alder (Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata) and Sitka willow (Salix sitchensis) may be serving as important microbial reservoirs for incoming plant colonizers.",10.1186/s12862-022-01974-2,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
1709,Plant diversity and litter accumulation mediate the loss of foliar endophyte fungal richness following nutrient addition,"Foliar fungal endophytes are ubiquitous plant symbionts that can affect plant growth and reproduction via their roles in pathogen and stress tolerance, as well as plant hormonal signaling. Despite their importance, we have a limited understanding of how foliar fungal endophytes respond to varying environmental conditions such as nutrient inputs. The responses of foliar fungal endophyte communities to increased nutrient deposition may be mediated by the simultaneous effects on within-host competition as well as the indirect impacts of altered host population size, plant productivity, and plant community diversity and composition. Here, we leveraged a 7-yr experiment manipulating nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients to investigate how nutrient-induced changes to plant diversity, plant productivity, and plant community composition relate to changes in foliar fungal endophyte diversity and richness in a focal native grass host, Andropogon gerardii. We found limited evidence of direct effects of nutrients on endophyte diversity. Instead, the effects of nutrients on endophyte diversity appeared to be mediated by accumulation of plant litter and plant diversity loss. Specifically, nitrogen addition is associated with a 40% decrease in plant diversity and an 11% decrease in endophyte richness. Although nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium addition increased aboveground live biomass and decreased relative Andropogon cover, endophyte diversity did not covary with live plant biomass or Andropogon cover. Our results suggest that fungal endophyte diversity within this focal host is determined in part by the diversity of the surrounding plant community and its potential impact on immigrant propagules and dispersal dynamics. Our results suggest that elemental nutrients reduce endophyte diversity indirectly via impacts on the local plant community, not direct response to nutrient addition. Thus, the effects of global change drivers, such as nutrient deposition, on characteristics of host populations and the diversity of their local communities are important for predicting the response of symbiont communities in a changing global environment.",10.1002/ecy.3210,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA

Fungal endophytes isolated from ethno-botanically important plants were the source of several secondary metabolites with potential biological activities. The present study has documented the variability of culturable endophytic fungi from Terminalia arjuna (Roxb.) Wight & Arn. (Combretaceae), a widely used medicinal plant of Tripura, North-east, India. A total of 613 fungal strains were isolated from 720 tissue segments viz. leaves, bark and root of T. arjuna. The highest numbers of endophytic fungal isolates were found to be colonizing in leaves (257) followed by barks (182) and the least number of isolates were obtained from roots (174). The fungal isolates were classified into 27 individual fungal strains based on morphological and microscopic features. A total of 9 endophytic fungal strains were identified using the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribe sequence and were subjected to phylogeny analysis. Most of the identified morphotypes belonged to phylum Ascomycota. Among all the isolates, Diaporthe sp., Fusarium sp., Colletotrichum sp., Penicillium sp. were the most abundant fungal isolates from T. arjuna. The fungal orders namely Sordariomycetes was the most prevalent followed by Eurotiomycetes and Dothideomycetes. Colonization rate, isolation rate, colonization frequency and relative frequency results suggest that leaf segments harbors maximum endophytic fungi assemblage compared to bark and root tissues. The analysis of Shannon (H'), Simpson (1-D), Fisher alpha (a) and Brillouin (HB) indices had significant difference with locations and tissue type. The host plant harbor unique endophytic community composition in studied sampling locations and their colonization varied between the inoculated vegetative parts of the plant.

1073,Diversity of endophytic mycobiota of tropical tree Tectona grandis Linn. f.: Spatiotemporal and tissue type effects,"Fungal endophytes were isolated from leaf, bark and stem of Tectona grandis Linn. f. sampled at four geographical locations in winter, summer and monsoon seasons. The recovered 5089 isolates were assigned to 45 distinct morphotypes based on morphology. The sequences of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) of the nrDNA of some morphotypes were identical, but morphological differences were strong enough to consider these morphotypes as separate species. Forty-three morphotypes were assigned to ascomycotina and two to basidiomycotina. Ascomycotina was the predominating group with 99.7% of total isolates followed by basidiomycotina with only 0.3% of total isolates. Diaporthe (Phomopsis) species dominated the communities independently on tissue type, location or season. More than 60% of the examined tissue pieces were colonized by members of this species complex. While these endophytes are ubiquitous others were tissue or location specific. Tissue type had the strongest effect on the species evenness of the endophytic assemblage followed by geographical location and season. However, Shannon-Wiener index (H') significantly (p <= 0.001) varied with all three factors i.e. season, location and tissue type. Leaves supported the highest diversity across all the seasons and locations. In conclusion, all the three factors together determined the structure of endophytic mycobiota assemblage of T. grandis.",10.1038/s41598-017-03933-0,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
3195,Diversity and ubiquity of xylariaceous endophytes in live and dead leaves of temperate forest trees,"To test the hypothesis that xylariaceous endophytes were ubiquitous on live and dead leaves of various tree species in the field, xylariaceous fungi were isolated from live leaves and bleached and nonbleached portions of dead leaves of a total of 94 tree species in a cool temperate forest in Japan. The biodiversity of xylariaceous endophytes was evaluated as the richness of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) determined by phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the D1/D2 region of the LSU rDNA of fungal isolates. A total of 326 isolates of xylariaceous fungi were isolated from live and dead leaves and classified into 15 OTUs. The three major OTUs, Xylaria sp.1, Nemania sp., and Biscogniauxia sp., accounted for 94% (308 isolates) of the total number of isolates, and were isolated from various live and dead leaves. Xylaria sp. 1 was frequently encountered on bleached portions (which were produced due to the selective decomposition of lignin) of dead leaves of broad-leaved deciduous tree species. The results suggest that xylariaceous endophytes did not show host specificity and had a saprobic phase on dead leaves in their life cycles and that Xylaria sp. 1 was capable of decomposing lignin in the field conditions.

6572,Rapid Discovery and Functional Characterization of Terpene Synthases from Four Endophytic Xylariaceae,"Endophytic fungi are ubiquitous plant endosymbionts that establish complex and poorly understood relationships with their host organisms. Many endophytic fungi are known to produce a wide spectrum of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with potential energy applications, which have been described as ""mycodiesel"". Many of these mycodiesel hydrocarbons are terpenes, a chemically diverse class of compounds produced by many plants, fungi, and bacteria. Due to their high energy densities, terpenes, such as pinene and bisabolene, are actively being investigated as potential ""drop-in"" biofuels for replacing diesel and aviation fuel. In this study, we rapidly discovered and characterized 26 terpene synthases (TPSs) derived from four endophytic fungi known to produce mycodiesel hydrocarbons. The TPS genes were expressed in an E. coli strain harboring a heterologous mevalonate pathway designed to enhance terpene production, and their product profiles were determined using Solid Phase Micro-Extraction (SPME) and GC-MS. Out of the 26 TPS's profiled, 12 TPS's were functional, with the majority of them exhibiting both monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthase activity.",10.1371/journal.pone.0146983,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
254,Endophytic fungi from medicinal plants: a treasure hunt for bioactive metabolites,"Endophytic fungi are ubiquitous organisms found in the plants, residing intercellular or intracellular, at least for a portion of their lives without causing apparent symptoms of infection. Almost all plants are known to harbor endophytes. The choice of the plant to be used for exploring endophytes for bioactives is important. Therefore, medicinal plants which are known to be used since centuries as an alternative source of medicine, are a valuable source for bioprospecting endophytes. Nevertheless, due to many reasons there is a dire need for novel resources for novel drugs which can be an answer to many deadly diseases. It is in this context that the present review was envisaged. The review reveals the importance of endophytic fungi from medicinal plants as a source of bioactive and chemically novel compounds. The bioactive metabolites produced by endophytic fungi originate from different biosynthetic pathways and belong to diverse structural groups such as terpenoids, steroids, quinones, phenols, coumarins etc. Endophytes therefore, represent a chemical reservoir for new compounds such as, anticancer, immunomodulatory, antioxidant, antiparasitic, antiviral, antitubercular, insecticidal etc. for use in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Although, efforts have been made to accommodate as many examples as possible but the depth of the subject is so vast that it cannot be covered in one single review. This in itself speaks of the fact that endophytic fungi from medicinal plants is indeed a treasure worth searching. In the present review only some selected examples have been covered.",10.1007/s11101-012-9260-6,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
212,Characterization of Secondary Metabolites of an Endophytic Fungus from Curcuma wenyujin,"Endophytic fungi are ubiquitous in the plant kingdom and they produce a variety of secondary metabolites to protect plant communities and to show some potential for human use. However, secondary metabolites produced by endophytic fungi in the medicinal plant Curcuma wenyujin are sparsely explored and characterized. The aim of this study was to characterize the secondary metabolites of an active endophytic fungus. M7226, the mutant counterpart of endophytic fungus EZG0807 previously isolated from the root of C. wenyujin, was as a target strain. After fermentation, the secondary metabolites were purified using a series of purification methods including thin layer chromatography, column chromatography with silica, ODS-C18, Sephadex LH-20, and macroporous resin, and were analyzed using multiple pieces of data (UV, IR, MS, and NMR). Five compounds were isolated and identified as curcumin, cinnamic acid, 1,4-dihydroxyanthraquinone, gibberellic acid, and kaempferol. Interestingly, curcumin, one of the main active ingredients of C. wenyujin, was isolated as a secondary metabolite from a fungal endophyte for the first time.",10.1007/s00284-014-0647-z,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
6001,Unveiling the bioactive potential of endophytic fungi,"Ubiquitous endophytic fungi, residing asymptomatically within plant tissues, harbor immense potential as biocontrol agents against diverse phytopathogens. This biodiversity exhibits multiple antifungal mechanisms, including direct inhibition through the production of lipopeptides, antibiotics, and lytic enzymes. Endophytes prevent colonization and establishment by competitively depriving pathogens of essential nutrients and space. Furthermore, they engage in active parasitism, directly consuming pathogen cells, and utilize siderophore production to sequester iron crucial for pathogen growth. Notably, endophytes trigger induced systemic resistance within the host plant, enabling broader protection against pathogens. This review comprehensively explores the potential of endophytic fungi as biocontrol agents, delving into their biology, isolation, identification, and antifungal activity. It highlights the secondary metabolites that are produced by endophytic fungi and their defensive responses against phytopathogens. Additionally, the review briefly discusses techniques employed to study these microbial interactions within host plants. By unraveling the intricacies of these mechanisms, researchers pave the way for optimizing endophytic fungi as eco-friendly and sustainable alternatives to traditional chemical fungicides, ultimately promoting sustainable plant disease management.",10.1127/nova_hedwigia/2025/0996,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
17563,Dynamics of seed-borne rice endophytes on early plant growth stages.,"Bacterial endophytes are ubiquitous to virtually all terrestrial plants. With the increasing appreciation of studies that unravel the mutualistic interactions between plant and microbes, we increasingly value the beneficial functions of endophytes that improve plant growth and development. However, still little is known on the source of established endophytes as well as on how plants select specific microbial communities to establish associations. Here, we used cultivation-dependent and -independent approaches to assess the endophytic bacterrial community of surface-sterilized rice seeds, encompassing two consecutive rice generations. We isolated members of nine bacterial genera. In particular, organisms affiliated with Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Ochrobactrum spp. were isolated from both seed generations. PCR-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) of seed-extracted DNA revealed that approximately 45% of the bacterial community from the first seed generation was found in the second generation as well. In addition, we set up a greenhouse experiment to investigate abiotic and biotic factors influencing the endophytic bacterial community structure. PCR-DGGE profiles performed with DNA extracted from different plant parts showed that soil type is a major effector of the bacterial endophytes. Rice plants cultivated in neutral-pH soil favoured the growth of seed-borne Pseudomonas oryzihabitans and Rhizobium radiobacter, whereas Enterobacter-like and Dyella ginsengisoli were dominant in plants cultivated in low-pH soil. The seed-borne Stenotrophomonas maltophilia was the only conspicuous bacterial endophyte found in plants cultivated in both soils. Several members of the endophytic community originating from seeds were observed in the rhizosphere and surrounding soils. Their impact on the soil community is further discussed.",10.1371/journal.pone.0030438,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
87,Foliar endophytic fungi: diversity in species and functions in forest ecosystems,"As mycorrhizal fungi, endophytic fungi are ubiquitous in natural forest ecosystems. A great number of foliar endophytic fungi (FEFs) have been isolated from leaves of forest trees, and some metabolites are also isolated and characterized from the FEFs. These metabolites show strong potential to inhibit or kill insects and pathogenic fungi, especially those causing decline or damage of forest trees. In addition, FEFs can inhabit in leaf litter for a short or long period depending on endophytic species, thus they affect decomposition rate of leaf litter. Some FEFs can colonize in plant roots and promote plant growth. In the review, we provide an overview of the ecological roles of FEFs and hope the resources of FEFs can be developed and be used in forestry and agriculture to reduce use of insectcides and fungicides and in pharmacology to maintain human health.",10.1007/s13199-019-00663-x,TRUE,,,,Presence,NA
