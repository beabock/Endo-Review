SAMPLE ABSTRACTS:
--- Abstract 1 ---
Title: Chitinolytic activities of endophytic bacteria isolated from symptom-free Chinese cabbage leaves 
DOI: NA 
Found patterns: endophytes are ubiquitous 
Context: by endophytic microorganisms, often bacteria and fungi. Endophytes are ubiquitous colonizers of the inner plant tissues where they do not 

--- Abstract 2 ---
Title: Are tropical fungal endophytes hyperdiverse? 
DOI: 10.1046/j.1461-0248.2000.00159.x 
Found patterns: endophytes are ubiquitous 
Context: Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous fungi that inhabit healthy plant tissues without causing 

--- Abstract 3 ---
Title: Bioactive secondary metabolites and their exploitation in the pharmaceutical industry produced by endophytic fungi 
DOI: NA 
Found patterns: endophytic fungi are ubiquitous 
Context: tions in the agriculture, pharmaceutical and food industry. Endophytic fungi are ubiquitous microorganisms living asymptomatically within the tissue 

--- Abstract 4 ---
Title: Fungal root endophytes influence plants in a species-specific manner that depends on plant's growth stage 
DOI: 10.1111/1365-2745.13584 
Found patterns: ubiquitous endophytic fungi 
Context: mutualistic and pathogenic fungi, the functional role of ubiquitous endophytic fungi remains little explored. We examined how root-inhabiting 

--- Abstract 5 ---
Title: Nitrogen-fixing bacteria and Oxalis - evidence for a vertically inherited bacterial symbiosis. 
DOI: 10.1186/s12870-019-2049-7 
Found patterns: endophytes are ubiquitous (fuzzy: 0.92) 
Context: No context available
