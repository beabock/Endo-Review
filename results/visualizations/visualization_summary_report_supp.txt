KEY FINDINGS:
- Species detection rate: 100 %
- Research methods coverage: 90.8 %
- Geographic information: 77.3 %
- Plant parts information: 73.6 %

SPECIES BY KINGDOM:
- Fungi : 42237 abstracts ( 57.8 %)
- Plantae : 30799 abstracts ( 42.2 %)

RESEARCH METHODS BREAKDOWN:
- Molecular methods: 6239 abstracts
- Culture-based methods: 12719 abstracts
- Microscopy methods: 3392 abstracts


RECOMMENDations FOR ANALYSIS:
1. Focus manual review on 'Presence' predictions with species detected
2. Investigate 'Absence' predictions that have species (potential misclassification)
3. Prioritize abstracts with complete information (species + methods + geography)
4. Use plant parts data for ecological niche analysis
5. Consider geographic patterns for global endophyte distribution studies
