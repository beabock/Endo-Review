KEY FINDINGS:
- Species detection rate: 82.2 %
- Research methods coverage: 89.1 %
- Geographic information: 72.9 %
- Plant parts information: 71.5 %

SPECIES BY KINGDOM:
- Fungi : 44003 abstracts ( 58.8 %)
- Plantae : 30799 abstracts ( 41.2 %)

RESEARCH METHODS BREAKDOWN:
- Molecular methods: 7223 abstracts
- Culture-based methods: 15146 abstracts
- Microscopy methods: 4157 abstracts

PREDICTION TYPE ANALYSIS:
- Presence : 19330 abstracts ( 99.7 %)
- Absence : 50 abstracts ( 0.3 %)

RECOMMENDations FOR ANALYSIS:
1. Focus manual review on 'Presence' predictions with species detected
2. Investigate 'Absence' predictions that have species (potential misclassification)
3. Prioritize abstracts with complete information (species + methods + geography)
4. Use plant parts data for ecological niche analysis
5. Consider geographic patterns for global endophyte distribution studies
