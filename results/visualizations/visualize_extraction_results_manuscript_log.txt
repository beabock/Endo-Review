VISUALIZATION FEATURES:
======================
- World maps with Robinson projection (more accurate than Mercator)
- Standard log scales (1, 10, 100, 1000) for data clarity
- Geographic regions (North vs South classification)
- Research method distributions (3 core + 9 expanded methods)
- Plant part frequency analysis
- Confidence level distributions
- Dual analysis modes (main/supplementary for mycorrhizal filtering)

TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:
=======================
- Map projection: Changed from Mercator to Robinson for better area representation
- Legend clarity: Explicitly states 'Gray = 0 studies' for data interpretation
- Scale standardization: Log scale ticks use standard breaks (1, 10, 100, 1000)
- Enhanced readability: Larger fonts, better legend positioning
- Geographic completeness: Shows countries, continents, regions, coordinates

KEY FINDINGS FOR MANUSCRIPT:
===========================
- Geographic coverage shows 12,218 abstracts with location data
- Research methods detected in 14,367 abstracts
- Most studied country: United States (7,352 abstracts)
- Most common method approach: Culture only
- Analysis reveals global research patterns in endophyte studies
