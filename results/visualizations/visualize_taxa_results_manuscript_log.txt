VISUALIZATION OUTPUTS:
=====================
- 24 phylum-based plots (12 main + 12 supplementary)
- 3 geographic-taxonomic visualizations
- 6 kingdoms × 2 taxonomic levels (count + percent) × 2 modes
- 2 data files: unrepresented taxa + geographic analysis
- Total: 27 visualization files + 2 data files

METHODOLOGY DETAILS:
===================
- Data source: GBIF Backbone Taxonomy
- Taxonomic validation: Synonym resolution to accepted names
- Filtering: Excludes extinct species, includes mycorrhizal classification
- Hierarchical counting: Species → Genera → Families within phyla
- Visualization: Enhanced with common names and species counts

KEY FINDINGS FOR MANUSCRIPT:
===========================
- Plant endophyte research covers 0.8% of known plant species diversity
- Most studied phylum: Langiophytophyta (22.2% coverage)
- Least studied phylum: NA (0.0% coverage)
- Analysis includes both presence and absence evidence detection
- Geographic distribution shows research concentration patterns
