1362,Differences in endophyte communities of introduced trees depend on the phylogenetic relatedness of the receiving forest,"Plant species sometimes perform extraordinarily well when introduced to new environments, through achieving higher growth rates, individual biomasses or higher densities in their receiving communities compared to their native range communities. One hypothesis proposed to explain enhanced performance in species' new environments is that their soil microbial communities may be different and provide greater benefit than microbial communities encountered in species' native environments. However, detailed descriptions of soil biota associated with species in both their native and introduced environments remain scarce. We established a global network of sites in regions where the tree species Pinus contorta has been introduced (Chile, New Zealand, Finland, Scotland and Sweden), as well as native range sites where the introduced populations originated (Canada and USA). We conducted pyrosequencing analysis to compare the root fungal endophyte communities associated with P.contorta in its native environments and in introduced environments with phylogenetically similar and dissimilar tree species (i.e. P.sylvestris in Europe and Nothofagus spp. in the Southern Hemisphere). Fungal communities associated with P.contorta consistently differed between its introduced and native environments. In Europe, P.contorta associated with the same community as P.sylvestris, where one particular species (Piloderma sphaerosporum) was particularly abundant relative to Canadian sites. In the Southern Hemisphere, P.contorta fungal communities were composed primarily of North American taxa and exhibited very little overlap with fungal communities associated with native Nothofagus spp.Synthesis. Our work shows that plants exhibit considerable plasticity in their interaction with fungi, by associating with different fungal communities across native and introduced environments. Our work also indicates that fungal communities associated with introduced plants can assemble through different mechanisms, that is by associating with existing fungal communities of phylogenetically close species, or through reassembly of co-introduced and co-invading fungi. The identification of different fungal communities in a plant species new environment provides an important step forward in understanding how soil biota may impact growth and invasion when a species is introduced to new environments.","Gundale, MJ; Almeida, JP; Wallander, H; Wardle, DA; Kardol, P; Nilsson, MC; Fajardo, A; Pauchard, A; Peltzer, DA; Ruotsalainen, S; Mason, B; Rosenstock, N",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2016,10.1111/1365-2745.12595,0.878560205553843,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999972993667548,2.70063324516871e-5,0.999999988919986,1.1080014017395e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,"Differences in endophyte communities of introduced trees depend on the phylogenetic relatedness of the receiving forest - Plant species sometimes perform extraordinarily well when introduced to new environments, through achieving higher growth rates, individual biomasses or higher densities in their receiving communities compared to their native range communities.

15681,Secondary metabolites of endophytic fungi from newbouldia laevis and cassia tora leaves: Prospecting for new antimicrobial agents,"Aim: This study tries to find new antimicrobial agents using some Nigerian plants. Background: Antimicrobial compounds from fungi endophytes have shown great promise in mitigating the threats of resistant pathogens. Objective: The study evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial property of secondary metabolites of endophytic fungi isolated from Newbouldia laevis and Cassia tora leaves. Methods: Ten endophytic fungi were isolated from the two plants’ leaves and later fermented on local rice for 21 days. Thereafter, their secondary metabolites were extracted using ethyl acetate. The antibacterial activity of the extracts on the test organisms were determined using agar diffusion and agar dilution methods, while the bioactive constituents were identified using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detector. Results: Nine of the crude extracts (NL1, NL3, NL6, NL10, NL12, CT2, CT7, CT9 and CT10) of the fungi isolates inhibited at least one of the microorganisms studied with maximum and minimum inhibition-zone-diameter of 14 mm and 2 mm, respectively while CT1 did not inhibit any of the tested microorganisms at tested concentrations. The extracts exhibited good antifungal activity, inhibiting the growth of both C. albicans and Trichophyton tested with an inhibition-zone-diameter ranging between 4-8 mm and 7-14 mm, respectively. The endophytic fungi extracts-CT2 and NL1-exhibited the best antimicrobial activity, inhibiting most of the tested microorganisms.

1743,Predicting interactions of the frass-associated yeast Hyphopichia heimii with Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata and twig-boring bark beetles,"Bark beetles are destructive insect pests known to form symbioses with different fungal taxa, including yeasts. The aim of this study was to (1) determine the prevalence of the rare yeast Hyphopichia heimii in bark beetle frass from wild olive trees in South Africa and to (2) predict the potential interaction of this yeast with trees and bark beetles. Twenty-eight culturable yeast species were isolated from frass in 35 bark beetle galleries, including representatives of H. heimii from nine samples. Physiological characterization of H. heimii isolates revealed that none was able to degrade complex polymers present in hemicellulose; however, all were able to assimilate sucrose and cellobiose, sugars associated with an arboreal habitat. All isolates were able to produce the auxin indole acetic acid, indicative of a potential symbiosis with the tree. Sterol analysis revealed that the isolates possessed ergosterol quantities ranging from 3.644 +/- 0.119 to 13.920 +/- 1.230 mg/g dry cell weight, which suggested that H. heimii could serve as a source of sterols in bark beetle diets, as is known for other bark beetle-associated fungi. In addition, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated that at least one of the isolates, Hyphopichia heimii CAB 1614, was able to convert the insect pheromone cis-verbenol to the anti-aggregation pheromone verbenone. This indicated that H. heimii could potentially influence beetle behaviour.

11781,Postglacial colonization history reflects in the genetic structure of natural populations of Festuca rubra in Europe,"We conducted a large-scale population genetic survey of genetic diversity of the host grass Festuca rubra s.l., which fitness can be highly dependent on its symbiotic fungus Epichloe festucae, to evaluate genetic variation and population structure across the European range. The 27 studied populations have previously been found to differ in frequencies of occurrence of the symbiotic fungus E. festucae and ploidy levels. As predicted, we found decreased genetic diversity in previously glaciated areas in comparison with nonglaciated regions and discovered three major maternal genetic groups: southern, northeastern, and northwestern Europe. Interestingly, host populations from Greenland were genetically similar to those from the Faroe Islands and Iceland, suggesting gene flow also between those areas. The level of variation among populations within regions is evidently highly dependent on the postglacial colonization history, in particular on the number of independent long-distance seed colonization events. Yet, also anthropogenic effects may have affected the population structure in F. rubra. We did not observe higher fungal infection rates in grass populations with lower levels of genetic variability. In fact, the fungal infection rates of E. festucae in relation to genetic variability of the host populations varied widely among geographical areas, which indicate differences in population histories due to colonization events and possible costs of systemic fungi in harsh environmental conditions.

The exact locations of herbivores within tree canopies were mapped during three successive summers. In the first 2 years, some trees were artificially colonized by eggs of the autumnal moth to induce both rapid and delayed resistance in the foliage. The natural infection levels of the pathogenic rust fungus (Melampsoridium betulinum), potentially involved in species interactions, were also recorded. At the level of the whole tree, the density of D. betulae leaf rolls was lower in trees infested by the autumnal moth in the same year. However, the feeding locations within trees were partly segregated: D. betulae favoured shadier branches, while E. autumnata preferred the sunny parts of the canopy. The autumnal moth did not affect current- or following-year density of leafminers at the tree or branch level. Trees infected by rust had fewer leafminers in the same summer than noninfected trees. There were no interaction effects between defoliation by the autumnal moth and rust infection, and no delayed effects on the abundance of other herbivores the following year. Taken together, these findings suggest that the autumnal moth has a negative, partially plant-mediated impact on D. betulae, and can reduce the extent of current-year defoliation caused by D. betulae. This may be beneficial for the mountain birch, since the greater part of D. betulae damage occurs around or after the end of the larval period of the autumnal moth, which may be a critical time for tree recovery after moth outbreaks.","Riihimäki, J; Kaitaniemi, P; Ruohomäki, K",OECOLOGIA,2003,10.1007/s00442-002-1082-6,0.699451620787856,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.96390239259463,0.03609760740537,0.99999999994138,5.861955365560329e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,"Spatial responses of two herbivore groups to a geometrid larva on mountain birch - Direct or plant-mediated interactions between herbivores may modify their spatial distribution among and within plants.

16808,First Report of Crown Rot and Stem Rot Caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG-4 on Marmalade Bush in Italy.,"Marmalade bush (Streptosolen jamesonii (Benth.) Miers), also known as fire bush, is an evergreen, perennial shrub in the family Solanaceae, which is native to South America (Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru). In Italy, this species is cultivated as an ornamental creeper or bush. During September 2009, a new disease was observed in a stock of ~10,000 pot-grown, 2-month-old plants of marmalade bush in a nursery in eastern Sicily, Italy. More than 50% of the plants exhibited symptoms of disease. Disease symptoms consisted of extensive water-soaked, dark brown lesions at the crown level that girdled entire stems and an internal brown discoloration of cortical tissue. Infected plants died within a few days. Diseased tissue was disinfested for 10 s in 1% NaOCl, rinsed with sterile water, and plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with streptomycin sulfate at 100 mg/liter. Fungal colonies were initially white, turned brown after 2 to 3 days, and produced irregularly shaped, brown sclerotia. Microscopic examination showed mycelium consistent with Rhizoctonia solani Kühn that branched at right angles, constricted at the base of the branch originating from primary hyphae, and septate near the constriction. The number of nuclei per hyphal cell was determined on cultures grown at 25°C on 2% water agar in petri plates by staining with 1% safranin O and 3% KOH solution (1) and examined at ×400. The hyphal cells were all multinucleate. Anastomosis group was determined by pairing isolates on 2% water agar in petri plates (2). Pairings were made with tester strains AG-1 IA, AG-2-2-1, AG-2-2IIIB, AG-2-2IV, AG-3, AG-4, AG-5, AG-6, and AG-11. Anastomosis was observed only with tester isolates of AG-4. Pathogenicity tests were performed by placing 1-cm2 plugs of PDA from 5-day-old mycelial cultures near the base of the stem on 25 potted, healthy, 2-month-old rooted cuttings of marmalade bush. The same number of plants treated with 1-cm2 PDA plugs served as controls. Following inoculation, all plants were maintained for 20 days at 25°C and 95% relative humidity under a 12-h fluorescent light/dark regimen. Crown and stem symptoms, identical to those observed in the nursery, developed 5 days after inoculation on all inoculated plants. Control plants remained symptomless. R. solani was consistently reisolated from symptomatic tissues and identified as previously described. To our knowledge, this is the first report of R. solani causing disease on marmalade bush.

2109,The Fungal Endophyte Penicillium olsonii ML37 Reduces Fusarium Head Blight by Local Induced Resistance in Wheat Spikes,"The fungal endophyte Penicillium olsonii ML37 is a biocontrol agent of Fusarium head blight in wheat (caused by Fusarium graminearum), which has shown a limited direct inhibition of fungal growth in vitro. We used RNA-seq and LC-MS/MS analyses to elucidate metabolic interactions of the three-way system Penicillium-wheat-Fusarium in greenhouse experiments. We demonstrated that P. olsonii ML37 colonises wheat spikes and transiently activates plant defence mechanisms, as pretreated spikes show a faster and stronger expression of the defence metabolism during the first 24 h after pathogen inoculation. This effect was transient and the expression of the same genes was lower in the pathogen-infected spikes than in those infected by P. olsonii alone. This response to the endophyte includes the transcriptional activation of several WRKY transcription factors. This early activation is associated with a reduction in FHB symptoms and significantly lower levels of the F. graminearum metabolites 15-acetyl-DON and culmorin. An increase in the Penicillium-associated metabolite asperphanamate confirms colonisation by the endophyte.

17642,First Report of Root and Basal Stem Rot Caused by Phytophthora nicotianae on Tree Aeonium (Aeonium arboreum) in Italy.,"The genus Aeonium, family Crassulaceae, comprises approximately 35 species that are native to northern Africa and the Canary Islands. Tree aeonium (Aeonium arboreum (L.) Webb & Berthel.) is a bushy, perennial succulent with rosettes of tender, waxy leaves at the apex of few-branched or occasionally single, naked stems. Mature rosettes bear yellowish inflorescences. Aeoniums are cultivated as ornamentals in gardens and containers. During the summer of 2009, in a garden in eastern Sicily (southern Italy), 3-year-old potted plants of tree aeonium showed stunting, shrivelling, and chlorosis of leaves and drop of external leaves associated with root and basal stem rot. Drops of an amber exudate oozed from the basal stem. Tissues of the basal stem were soft, but no external necrosis was visible. A species of Phytophthora was consistently isolated from symptomatic roots and basal stem tissues on a medium selective for Oomycetes (2). Axenic cultures were obtained by single-hypha transfers. The pathogen was identified by morphological criteria as Phytophthora nicotianae B. de Haan; it formed stoloniferous colonies on potato dextrose agar and grew between 8 and 38°C, with the optimum at 30°C. On V8 juice agar it produced spherical, intercalary chlamydospores (mean diameter of 26 μm) and persistent, mono- and bipapillate, spherical to ovoid, ellipsoid, obpyriform sporangia that measured 29 to 56 × 22 to 45 μm with a mean length/breadth ratio of 1.3:1. All isolates were A2 mating type and formed spherical oogonia (mean diameter 28 ± 2 μm) with smooth walls and amphigynous antheridia in dual cultures with a reference isolate of the A1 mating type of P. nicotianae. BLAST analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA of a representative isolate from aeonium (IMI 398812, GenBank Accession No. HQ433333) amplified by PCR using the ITS6/ITS4 universal primers (1), revealed 99% similarity with the sequences of a reference isolate of P. nicotianae available in GenBank (Accession No. EU331089.1). Pathogenicity of isolate IMI 398812 was demonstrated by transplanting cuttings of A. arboreum into pots filled with a mixture of steam-sterilized sandy loam soil and inoculum (4% vol/vol) produced by growing the isolate for 20 days on wheat kernels. Ten plants were transplanted into 3-liter pots (two plants per pot) while 10 plants, transplanted into pots filled with a mixture of steam-sterilized soil and noninoculated kernels, were used as controls. Plants were kept in a greenhouse at 25 to 28°C and watered daily to field capacity. Thirty to forty days after the transplanting into infested soil, cuttings developed the same symptoms observed on plants with natural infections. Control plants remained symptomless. P. nicotianae was reisolated from symptomatic plants, thereby completing Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. nicotianae on an Aeonium species worldwide. The economic relevance of this disease is minor because aeoniums are not cultivated on a large scale.

Tree aeonium (Aeonium arboreum (L.) Webb & Berthel.) is a bushy, perennial succulent with rosettes of tender, waxy leaves at the apex of few-branched or occasionally single, naked stems. Mature rosettes bear yellowish inflorescences. Aeoniums are cultivated as ornamentals in gardens and containers. During the summer of 2009, in a garden in eastern Sicily (southern Italy), 3-year-old potted plants of tree aeonium showed stunting, shrivelling, and chlorosis of leaves and drop of external leaves associated with root and basal stem rot. Drops of an amber exudate oozed from the basal stem. Tissues of the basal stem were soft, but no external necrosis was visible. A species of Phytophthora was consistently isolated from symptomatic roots and basal stem tissues on a medium selective for Oomycetes (2). Axenic cultures were obtained by single-hypha transfers. The pathogen was identified by morphological criteria as Phytophthora nicotianae B. de Haan; it formed stoloniferous colonies on potato dextrose agar and grew between 8 and 38°C, with the optimum at 30°C. On V8 juice agar it produced spherical, intercalary chlamydospores (mean diameter of 26 μm) and persistent, mono- and bipapillate, spherical to ovoid, ellipsoid, obpyriform sporangia that measured 29 to 56 × 22 to 45 μm with a mean length/breadth ratio of 1.3:1. All isolates were A2 mating type and formed spherical oogonia (mean diameter 28 ± 2 μm) with smooth walls and amphigynous antheridia in dual cultures with a reference isolate of the A1 mating type of P. nicotianae. BLAST analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA of a representative isolate from aeonium (IMI 398812, GenBank Accession No. HQ433333) amplified by PCR using the ITS6/ITS4 universal primers (1), revealed 99% similarity with the sequences of a reference isolate of P. nicotianae available in GenBank (Accession No. EU331089.1). Pathogenicity of isolate IMI 398812 was demonstrated by transplanting cuttings of A. arboreum into pots filled with a mixture of steam-sterilized sandy loam soil and inoculum (4% vol/vol) produced by growing the isolate for 20 days on wheat kernels. Ten plants were transplanted into 3-liter pots (two plants per pot) while 10 plants, transplanted into pots filled with a mixture of steam-sterilized soil and noninoculated kernels, were used as controls. Plants were kept in a greenhouse at 25 to 28°C and watered daily to field capacity. Thirty to forty days after the transplanting into infested soil, cuttings developed the same symptoms observed on plants with natural infections. Control plants remained symptomless. P. nicotianae was reisolated from symptomatic plants, thereby completing Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. nicotianae on an Aeonium species worldwide. The economic relevance of this disease is minor because aeoniums are not cultivated on a large scale. Moreover, the disease may be easily prevented by avoiding excess irrigation water since aeoniums need a well-drained soil or potting mix and do not tolerate soil waterlogging. References: (1) D. E.

This study aimed to isolate endophytic bacteria from sterilized surfaces of germinated black upland rice seeds for GABA production and optimization. A total of 38 isolates were screened for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity using a colorimetric method. Among these, thirteen isolates exhibited positive GAD activity. The BRB-3 strain emerged as the most promising, producing the highest GABA levels (4.54 g/L) at an optimal pH of 6.5. However, the BRB-3 strain was sensitive to pH lower than 5.5; so the pH was adjusted to 6.5 through all experiments. Further identification of the BRB-3 strain was performed using 16S rRNA gene sequence, which placed it in Bacillus cereus group. Subsequent rpoB gene sequence analysis confirmed that the BRB-3 strain was Bacillus thuringiensis BRB-3. GABA production was optimized in MRS broth by investigating carbon, nitrogen, monosodium glutamate (MSG), pH and temperature.

18743,Genetic Blueprint for Stringent Response in Betaproteobacterial Aromatoleum/Azoarcus/Thauera Cluster.,"The Aromatoleum/Azoarcus/Thauera (AAT) cluster comprises anaerobic degradation specialists (Aromatoleum, Thauera) and N2-fixing endophytes (Azoarcus). Omics-based and genetic studies with associated model strains implicate stringent response (SR) in adaptation to nutrient limitation and plant colonization. SR is well-studied in standard bacteria such as Escherichia coli and known as adaptive strategy to nutrient limitations by adjusting e.g., transcription and stress response. SR involves the alarmone (p)ppGpp, whose cellular level is controlled by the synthetases/hydrolases RelA/SpoT and the noncanonical transcription factor DksA, whose interaction with RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding of (p)ppGpp enhances. DksA-mediated SR occurs across Proteobacteria and other phylogenetic groups such as Myxococcia and Spirochaetia, mostly applying to pathogens. Furthermore, all three DksA variants (four, two or one cysteine residue(s) for Zn2+-binding) were found. Genes encoding SR components are present in all studied 37 genomes representing 31 species from the AAT cluster. Each genome encodes a synthesizing RelA, a hydrolyzing SpoT, a four cysteine-containing DksA, and mostly also a one cysteine-containing DksA. Opposing functions of RelA and SpoT in Aromatoleum aromaticum EbN1T, Aromatoleum sp. strain CIB, Azoarcus olearius BH72, and Thauera aromatica K172T (also entire AAT cluster) are implicated by full conservation of amino acids (E and D vs. 2H2D motif and ED diad) essential for catalysis by their synthetase versus hydrolase domains. Likewise, functionality of the predicted C4-type DksAs from these four model strains was visually assessed by structural modeling and comparison of key features (binding sites for Zn2+/(p)ppGpp; CC tip for RNAP interaction) to those of the available E. coli DksA cryo-EM structure. SR as a global adaptation strategy should contribute to the success of the AAT cluster in its distinct habitats: complex and highly variable soils/sediments (high molecular and microbial diversity, fluctuating nutrient availabilities and redox states) of the free-living degradation specialists versus the defined endorhizosphere (more stable conditions, less complex community) of the endophytes. A noteworthy exception is Aromatoleum sp. strain CIB by combining degradation and endophytic features. Thus, future investigations into the role of SR in the habitat success of such bacteria reflecting their divergent environmental niches are needed as well as promising.",Becker P; Ruickoldt J; Wendler P; Reinhold-Hurek B; Rabus R,Microbial physiology,2025,10.1159/000546200,0.827165695949433,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.774960931366196,0.225039068633804,0.999999831962473,1.68037526893094e-7,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain,"Genetic Blueprint for Stringent Response in Betaproteobacterial Aromatoleum/Azoarcus/Thauera Cluster. - The Aromatoleum/Azoarcus/Thauera (AAT) cluster comprises anaerobic degradation specialists (Aromatoleum, Thauera) and N2-fixing endophytes (Azoarcus).

Opposing functions of RelA and SpoT in Aromatoleum aromaticum EbN1T, Aromatoleum sp. strain CIB, Azoarcus olearius BH72, and Thauera aromatica K172T (also entire AAT cluster) are implicated by full conservation of amino acids (E and D vs. 2H2D motif and ED diad) essential for catalysis by their synthetase versus hydrolase domains. Likewise, functionality of the predicted C4-type DksAs from these four model strains was visually assessed by structural modeling and comparison of key features (binding sites for Zn2+/(p)ppGpp; CC tip for RNAP interaction) to those of the available E. coli DksA cryo-EM structure. SR as a global adaptation strategy should contribute to the success of the AAT cluster in its distinct habitats: complex and highly variable soils/sediments (high molecular and microbial diversity, fluctuating nutrient availabilities and redox states) of the free-living degradation specialists versus the defined endorhizosphere (more stable conditions, less complex community) of the endophytes. A noteworthy exception is Aromatoleum sp. strain CIB by combining degradation and endophytic features. Thus, future investigations into the role of SR in the habitat success of such bacteria reflecting their divergent environmental niches are needed as well as promising."
9826,Drivers of Foliar Fungal Endophytic Communities of Kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata) in the Southeast United States,"Fungal endophytes play important roles in plant fitness and plant-microbe interactions. Kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata) is a dominant, abundant, and highly aggressive invasive plant in the Southeast United States. Kudzu serves as a pathogen reservoir that impacts economically important leguminous crops. We conducted the first investigations on kudzu fungal endophytes (Illumina MiSeq-ITS2) to elucidate drivers of endophytic communities across the heart of the invasive range in the Southeast United States (TN, MS, AL, GA). We tested the impacts of multiple environmental parameters (Chlorophyll, NO3-, K+, soil pH, leaf area, host genotype, traffic intensity, and geographic location) on foliar endophyte communities. Endophytic communities were diverse and structured by many factors in our PerMANOVA analyses, but location, genotype, and traffic (proxy for pollution) were the strongest drivers of community composition (R-2 = 0.152, p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.129, p < 0.001, and R-2 = 0.126, p < 0.001, respectively). Further, we examined the putative ecological interactions between endophytic fungi and plant pathogens. We identify numerous OTUs that are positively and strongly associated with pathogen occurrence, largely within the families Montagnulaceae and Tremellales incertae sedis.

11738,Differences in fungal communities associated to Festuca paniculata roots in subalpine grasslands,"Mycorrhizal fungi or endphytes colonize plant roots and their occurrence and composition depend on biotic and abiotic characteristics of the ecosystem. We investigated the composition of these microbial communities associated with Festuca paniculata, a slow growing species, which dramatically impacts functional plant diversity and the recycling of organic matter in subalpine grasslands. F. paniculata individuals from both mown and unmown grasslands were randomly collected and the microscopic observation of the plant roots revealed a difference in fungal colonization according to management. The ITS regions of root-associated fungi were amplified, cloned and sequenced. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a total of 43 and 35 phylotypes in mown and unmown grasslands respectively, highlighting a remarkable difference in the composition between both fungal communities. The phylotypes were assigned to 9 classes in which two classes Eurotiomycetes and Lecanoromycetes were specific to mown grasslands, while Tremellomycetes were specific to unmown grasslands and only five phylotypes were common to both locations. The comparative analysis of fungal lifestyles indicated the dominance of saprobes and a large proportion of endophytes compared to the mycorrhizal fungi (7/1 and 11/2 phylotypes in mown and unmown grasslands, respectively).

3609,Microbial communities in crop phyllosphere and root endosphere are more resistant than soil microbiota to fertilization,"Crop harbors diverse microbial communities that profoundly influence host health and agricultural productivity. Crop habitat is a dynamic and heterogeneous environment, and thus crop microbiota may display spatial organization across different compartments. However, impacts of long-term fertilization, as a common agricultural practice, on the assembly of crop microbiota and their relationships with crop yield and quality remain largely unresolved. Here, we collected sorghum roots and leaves, and rhizosphere and bulk soils, from an eight-year field experiment with multiple fertilization regimes, and characterized sorghum-associated microbiomes by amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS region. Rhizosphere and bulk soils harbored significantly higher diversity of bacteria and fungi than phyllosphere and root endophytes, and the microbial community composition significantly differed across the four compartments. Fertilization significantly influenced the diversity and compositions of sorghum-associated microbial communities, but had more pronounced effects on rhizosphere and bulk soil microbiomes through altering the relative abundances of some major microbial bio-markers.

Crop habitat is a dynamic and heterogeneous environment, and thus crop microbiota may display spatial organization across different compartments. However, impacts of long-term fertilization, as a common agricultural practice, on the assembly of crop microbiota and their relationships with crop yield and quality remain largely unresolved. Here, we collected sorghum roots and leaves, and rhizosphere and bulk soils, from an eight-year field experiment with multiple fertilization regimes, and characterized sorghum-associated microbiomes by amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS region. Rhizosphere and bulk soils harbored significantly higher diversity of bacteria and fungi than phyllosphere and root endophytes, and the microbial community composition significantly differed across the four compartments. Fertilization significantly influenced the diversity and compositions of sorghum-associated microbial communities, but had more pronounced effects on rhizosphere and bulk soil microbiomes through altering the relative abundances of some major microbial bio-markers.

Sampled grapevine plants included the three most representative cultivars in the region, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Aragonez, growing under two different modes of management, conventional and biological. Sixteen fungal taxa were identified through sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region. Total number of endophytic fungi isolated showed significant differences both in management mode and in cultivars, with higher numbers in grapevines under conventional mode and from Syrah cultivar. The composition of fungal endophytic communities did not show significant differences among cultivars, but differences were observed between fungal communities isolated from grapevines under biological or conventional modes. The most fungal taxa isolated from grapevines cultivated under biological mode were Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium sp., and Nigrospora oryzae, and under conventional mode Botrytis cinerea, Epicoccum nigrum, and Epicoccum sp.

11136,Resistance to triadimefon and benomyl: Dynamics and impact on managing cucurbit powdery mildew,"Frequency of fungicide-resistant strains of Podosphaera xanthii on pumpkins in New York before treatment varied from 3 to 80% for the demethylation inhibiting (DMI) fungicide triadimefon and from 0 to 48% for the benzimidazole fungicide benomyl between 1993 and 1996. When the initial frequency of triadimefon-resistant strains was less than 55%, one application of triadimefon plus chlorothalonil was effective. This application was made after reaching the action threshold of one leaf with powdery mildew symptoms per 50 old leaves (defined as the oldest third of the foliage). The frequency of triadimefon-resistant strains increased from 3 to 71% by 20 days after the first fungicide application in 1993. Triadimefon in the second application did not contribute to control. Loss of efficacy was due to resistance because, compared with triadimefon-treated pumpkins, pumpkins treated with other systemic fungicides were less severely infected by powdery mildew on abaxial leaf surfaces where the companion multi-site contact fungicide contributes little to control. Triadimefon was not effective in 1995 when 80% of the pathogen population was resistant before treatment. Benomyl was effective in 1995, but not in 1996 when 48% of the isolates tested were resistant to both benomyl and triadimefon before treatment. An in-field seedling assay was developed to determine local occurrence of resistant strains before the first treatment was needed.

12517,High Diversity of Epicoccum Species Associated with Leaf Spot on Italian Ryegrass in Southwestern China: Six New Records and Three New Species,"Italian ryegrass is widely cultivated for the production of forage, hay, and silage because of its high nutritional value and good palatability. Leaf spots caused by fungi pose a serious threat to forage crops. In order to expand the knowledge of fungi causing leaf spots in ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) in Sichuan, Yunnan, Chongqing, and Guizhou of southwestern China, a comprehensive survey was undertaken from 2015 to 2022. The survey discovered that Epicoccum leaf spot (ELS) was a common and widespread disease, more serious at the late stage of growth (after late May). Symptomatic leaf samples collected from the four different provinces were analyzed, and a total of 202 Epicoccum isolates were obtained. Based on both multilocus phylogeny (ITS, LSU, TUB2, and RPB2) and morphology, 10 Epicoccum species were finally identified, including three novel species (E. endololii sp. nov., E. lolii sp. nov., and E. loliicola sp. nov.), six new host records (E. draconis, E. endophyticum, E. oryzae, E. plurivorum, E. thailandicum, and E. tobaicum), and an unknown species (Epicoccum sp.1). Pathogenicity tests showed that E. endophyticum, E. endololii, and Epicoccum sp.1 were nonpathogenic to Italian ryegrass, which were confirmed as endophytes in this study; the other six species could infect Italian ryegrass and cause leaf lesions to different degrees, of which E. draconis was more aggressive (P <= 0.05). Coupled with the isolation rates and geographical distributions of these species, it was found that E. plurivorum was the predominant pathogen in Yunnan while E. oryzae and E. tobaicum were the predominant pathogens in the other three provinces.

8645,Assessment of Endophytic Fungal Community in Palm Leaves and Their Biocontrol Potential,"Microbial endophytes live asymptomatically within a host plant and contribute positively to its fitness. Endophytes associate ubiquitously with all plants examined so far and form an integral part of the host for processes such as nutrient uptake and stress response and traits like disease resistance. Well-characterized host-endophyte interaction models exist, but little is known about the microbiome of the monocot plant host, palm. In this study, we identified the endophytic fungal community associated with mule palm leaves with an objective to test their antagonist effects on lethal pathogens of palms. The leaflets of mule palms were sampled across five sites in Central and South Florida, and fungal endophytes were identified using culture-dependent (CD) and amplicon sequence-based culture-independent (CI) methods. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) corresponding to phylum Ascomycota were identified by both approaches, whereas Basidiomycota were only detected using the CI method. Among the ascomycetes, a small (22%) overlap in the OTUs at the genus level was observed between the two methods, whereas the majority (64%) of OTUs were detected using the CI approach. In vitro cocultivation of endophytes with palm pathogens was observed to produce three distinct interaction phenotypes: inhibition zone, niche establishment, and overlapping growth. Eight endophytes capable of inhibiting fungal pathogen growth in vitro were also identified, suggesting a biocontrol potential for endophyte-derived secondary metabolites. A better understanding of the composition, assembly, and ecology of palm-associated microbial communities would eventually lead to healthy and resilient palms.Copyright (c) 2024 The Author(s).

In Exp. 1, fescue was 70 to 100% infected with the endophyte fungus Neotyphodium coenophialum ([Morgan-Jones and Gams] Glenn, Bacon, and Hanlin). Twenty-four wether lambs (initial BW 41 kg; SD = 5) grazed fescue treated with 0, 1.7, or 3.4 kg Tasco/ha applied in April and July, 1994, with four replications per treatment.

Steers that grazed infected tall fescue in Mississippi had lower (P < 0.05) serum vitamin E by the end of the grazing season. At both locations Tasco increased (P < 0.05) activity of superoxide dismutase in both infected and uninfected fescue. The endophyte in tall fescue seemed to decrease antioxidant activity in grazing steers, whereas Tasco seemed to increase antioxidant activity in both the forage and the grazing ruminant. Tasco may provide opportunities to reduce oxidative stress in plants and animals."

2141,Forest and Plantation Soil Microbiomes Differ in Their Capacity to Suppress Feedback Between Geosmithia morbida and Rhizosphere Pathogens of Juglans nigra Seedlings,"Thousand cankers disease (TCD) is hypothesized to have a greater impact on eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) in urban forests and plantations compared with natural forest stands. Along with other factors such as resource availability, the phytobiome could partly account for observed differences in disease severity across management regimes. We investigated the extent to which J. nigra-associated soil microbiomes from plantations and natural forests modulate (i) the amount of necrosis caused by Geosmithia morbida in 1-year-old seedlings, and (ii) relative abundance of rhizosphere endophytes and opportunistic pathogens Fusarium and Rhizoctonia in response to aboveground inoculation with G. morbida. Our results suggest that the microbiome from natural forest soil in central Indiana suppresses Fusarium spp. and is indirectly suppressive of G. morbida. Natural forest soil had a greater ability to reduce the size of necrotic area caused by G. morbida compared with steam-treated soil. Inoculating stems of seedlings with G. morbida induced a shift in fungal community composition in the rhizosphere, including Fusarium and Rhizoctonia spp.; however, the direction and magnitude of the shift depended on whether seedlings were amended with forest, plantation, or steam-treated soil. In a companion experiment, necrotic area in G. morbida-inoculated seedlings was twice as high in seedlings grown from seeds that were treated with Fusarium solani relative to those grown from seed treated with water.

7645,Isolation and Characterization of Antibacterial Compounds from Aspergillus fumigatus: An Endophytic Fungus from a Mangrove Plant of the Sundarbans,"The Sundarbans, a UNESCO world heritage site, is one of the largest mangrove forests in one stretch. Mangrove plants from this forest are little studied for their endophytic fungi. In this study, we isolated fourteen endophytic fungi from the plants Ceriops decandra and Avicennia officinalis collected from the Sundarbans. Five of them were identified as Aspergillus sp. and one as Penicillium sp. by macroscopic and microscopic observation. Antibacterial activity of the crude extracts obtained from these endophytes was determined against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using resazurin-based microtiter assay. The isolated endophytes showed varying degrees of antibacterial activity with MICs ranging between 5 and 0.078 mg/mL. Molecular identification of the most active endophyte revealed its identity as Aspergillus fumigatus obtained from the leaves of C. decandra. Acute toxicity study of the ethyl acetate extract of A. fumigatus in mice revealed no mortality even at the highest dose of 2000 mg/kg bodyweight, though some opposing results are found in the subacute toxicity study. The extract was subjected to silica gel and Sephadex column chromatography resulting in the isolation of three pure compounds. LC-MS analysis of these pure compounds revealed their identity as fumigaclavine C, azaspirofuran B, and fraxetin. This is the first report of fraxetin from A. fumigatus. All three identified compounds were previously reported for their antibacterial activity against different strains of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

15229,Plant Seedling Growth Stimulation and Antifungal Activities of Volatile Organic Compounds Emitted by Aspergillus flavus Endophyte,"Introduction: Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) produced by Plant Growth Promoting fungi (PGPF) have recently been investigated due to their role in plant growth promotion and defense. Whereas many VOCs produced by PGPF promote seed growth. It is known that VOCs, among several other mechanisms, are responsible for the antagonistic activity produced by microorganisms. In this study, we focused on a comparative study between the VOCs emitted by the endophyte A. flavus AFEG-2017 and its host plant (Eleocharis geniculata) and the role of these VOCs in the growth promotion and biological control of some economic plants. Materials and Methods: VOCs from AFEG-2017 and E. geniculata were extracted using ethyl acetate. Then, the analysis of emitted VOCs was accomplished by using gas chromatography mass (GC-MS). Seedling stimulation assay was investigated on seeds of Trigonella foenum-graecum, Solanum lycopersicum, Portulaca oleracea, and Lepidium sativum. In addition, the antifungal activity of VOCs was evaluated against some plant pathogenic fungi. Results: The GC-MS analysis of the volatile emitted from A. flavus (AFEG-2017) resulted in 25 organic and bioactive compounds; of them 2-(2-hydroxy-3-isobutoxypropyl) pent-4-enoic acid, hydrazide was the most abundant compound. The findings of the present study advocate that linalool, linalyl acetate, geranyl acetate, oleic acid, 1-eicosanol, and 1-chloro-octadecane are suitable as biocontrol agents against phytopathogenic fungi. In addition, the volatiles of Euphorbia geniculata showed 28 bioactive compounds, in which Phytol was the most abundant one. The VOCs produced by AFEG-2017 enhanced the seedling growth of T. foenum-graecum, S. lycopersicum, P. oleracea, and L. sativum. Also, VOCS showed inhibition in the tested pathogenic fungi growth like Fusarium oxysporum which showed the highest inhibition percentage in the growth (40%).

9620,Increased populations of deleterious fluorescent pseudomonads colonizing rhizomes of leatherleaf fern (Rumohra adiantiformis) and expression of symptoms of fern distortion syndrome after application of Ben late systemic fungicide,"The overall objective of the current study was to test two hypotheses: (1) application of the systemic fungicide Benlate to leatherleaf fern results in long-term increases in populations of deleterious fluorescent pseudomonads that endophytically colonize rhizomes; (2) such endophytic colonization, resulting from Benlate treatment, is associated with damage to leatherleaf fern and development of symptoms of fern distortion syndrome (FDS). Mean populations of fluorescent pseudomonads and total aerobic bacteria in the rhizosphere were significantly increased 3 months after the application of Benlate 50 WP and Benlate 50 DF as foliar sprays and drenches, compared to populations in the non-treated control. In another test, at 5 months after treatment, endophytic populations of fluorescent pseudomonads inside rhizomes of plants treated with Benlate 50 WP and Benlate 50 DF (both from DuPont) were significantly higher than populations in rhizomes of plants treated with three different generic sources of Benlate 50 WP, the active ingredient benomyl, and MBC. In the same test, treatments with the two DuPont sources of Benlate, but not the generic sources, benomyl, or MBC resulted in reduced overall growth of plants, including reductions weight of fronds, roots and rhizomes and caliper of rhizomes. Three long-term experiments examined the effect of Benlate 50 WP and Benlate 50 DF on populations of fluorescent pseudomonads and development of distortions of frond growth and other symptoms associated with FDS. In two tests at 24 months after application, treatment with both formulations of Benlate increased endophytic populations of fluorescent pseudomonads inside rhizomes, compared to controls, in both experiments, and endophytic populations inside petioles of fronds arising from rhizomes were significantly greater with both Benlate treatments in one test where this parameter was measured. Also at 24 months after application, the Benlate treatments were associated with significant increases in severity of FDS, using a previously reported rating scale and by measuring several other parameters associated with FDS. In the third long-term test, the first crop of fronds was cut 24 months after treatment. Four weeks later, the numbers of actively growing rhizomes (that had produced new fronds) were significantly reduced on Benlate-treated plants, compared to the controls. At 6 months after cutting (30 months after Benlate treatments), weights of fronds were lower on Benlate-treated plants than on controls. Characterization of fluorescent pseudomonads isolated from inside rhizomes and petioles at 24 months after treatment revealed that applications of Benlate resulted in a marked increase in pectinolytic activity. DNA sequencing of 150 strains of fluorescent pseudomonads from inside rhizomes and 60 from inside petioles at 24 months after application of Benlate indicated low matches to type strains in the ribosomal data base. Phylogenetic characterization of the strains indicated the existence of 10 clusters. Pronounced shifts in frequency of strains in the various clusters were noted with Benlate treatment: over 70% of strains from rhizomes of Benlate-treated plants belonged to cluster E3, compared to only 2% of the strains from control rhizomes, and 98% of the control strains belonged to clusters C, D2, F. and G, while none of the strains from petioles or rhizomes of Benlate-treated plants belonged to these four clusters. In summary, treatment of leatherleaf fern with Benlate 50 WP and Benlate 50 DF from DuPont led to a progression of long-term deleterious effects on leatherleaf fern that were associated with increased populations of fluorescent pseudomonads that were functionally and phylogenetically different from pseudomonads from control plants.

Also at 24 months after application, the Benlate treatments were associated with significant increases in severity of FDS, using a previously reported rating scale and by measuring several other parameters associated with FDS. In the third long-term test, the first crop of fronds was cut 24 months after treatment. Four weeks later, the numbers of actively growing rhizomes (that had produced new fronds) were significantly reduced on Benlate-treated plants, compared to the controls. At 6 months after cutting (30 months after Benlate treatments), weights of fronds were lower on Benlate-treated plants than on controls. Characterization of fluorescent pseudomonads isolated from inside rhizomes and petioles at 24 months after treatment revealed that applications of Benlate resulted in a marked increase in pectinolytic activity. DNA sequencing of 150 strains of fluorescent pseudomonads from inside rhizomes and 60 from inside petioles at 24 months after application of Benlate indicated low matches to type strains in the ribosomal data base. Phylogenetic characterization of the strains indicated the existence of 10 clusters. Pronounced shifts in frequency of strains in the various clusters were noted with Benlate treatment: over 70% of strains from rhizomes of Benlate-treated plants belonged to cluster E3, compared to only 2% of the strains from control rhizomes, and 98% of the control strains belonged to clusters C, D2, F. and G, while none of the strains from petioles or rhizomes of Benlate-treated plants belonged to these four clusters. In summary, treatment of leatherleaf fern with Benlate 50 WP and Benlate 50 DF from DuPont led to a progression of long-term deleterious effects on leatherleaf fern that were associated with increased populations of fluorescent pseudomonads that were functionally and phylogenetically different from pseudomonads from control plants.

13161,Endophytic and entomopathogenic strains of Beauveria sp to control the bovine tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus.,"Pathogenicity of strains of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana and endophytic strains of Beauveria sp against the bovine tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus was tested in laboratory bioassays and under field conditions. Suspensions containing 10(5), 10(7) and 10(9) conidia/mL were prepared of each fungal strain for laboratory bioassays. The ticks were maintained at 28 degrees C, 90 +/- 5% relative humidity, and the following variables were evaluated: initial female weight, egg weight, hatching percentage, reproductive efficiency, and percentage control. For tests under field conditions, a Beauveria suspension containing 10(6) conidia/mL was sprayed on tick-infested cows. After 72 h, the ticks were collected to estimate mortality under field conditions. Laboratory bioassays showed a mortality of 20 to 50% of the ticks seven days after inoculation with 10(7) Beauveria conidia/mL.

17754,Protection to Tomato Wilt Disease Conferred by the Nonpathogen Fusarium oxysporum Fo47 is More Effective Than that Conferred by Avirulent Strains.,"Although the vascular pathogen Fusarium oxysporum is notorious for being the causal agent of Fusarium wilt disease, the vast majority of F. oxysporum strains are harmless soil and root colonizers. The latter F. oxysporum's are often endophytes colonizing roots intracellularly without negatively affecting plant fitness. Actually, most of them, like Fo47, are beneficial providing biological control to various root pathogens. Interestingly, also pathogenic F. oxysporum inoculated on a resistant host (i.e., avirulent F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici) can reduce susceptibility to virulent F. oxysporum strains via a mechanism called ""cross protection.""

Currently, it is unknown whether the biocontrol activity of F. oxysporum endophytes utilizes similar mechanisms as cross protection conferred by avirulent pathogens, and whether both provide a quantitative similar level of protection.

15338,Estimation of metabolic activity of cut flowers during a study to enhance vase life of Cymbidium hybrid cut-flowers,"In this study, the metabolic activity (MA) of orchid cut flowers was estimated by the modified alkali trap method for the first time, when an approach was made to increase the vase life of Cymbidium miniature hybrid and Cymbidium hybrid ‘H. C. Aurora’ cut flowers. Metabolic inhibitors like-systemic fungicides (Carbendazim and Metalaxyl) and darkness were used to increase the vase life of the cut flowers. Cut flowers kept with metabolic inhibitors had significantly higher relative fresh weight (RFW), rate of vase solution uptake (RVSU) and significantly lower MA compared to control, which consequently increased the vase life of the cut flowers. The vase life was maximum under Carbendazim + darkness treatment (C200 + D), followed by Carbendazim (C200)> Metalaxyl +Darkness (M200 + D)> Metalaxyl (M200)> Distilled water + Darkness (D)> Control, whereas the MA was maximum under the Control treatment, followed by D > M200 > M200 + D > C200 > C200 + D treatments for both the cut flowers. The C200 + D treatment increased the vase life by ∼31 and 27% for Cymbidium miniature hybrid and Cymbidium hybrid ‘H. C. Aurora’, respectively, compared to the control treatment.

15251,Effects of Organic Management Mode on Soil Fungal Community Structure and Functions in Tea Gardens; [有机管理模式对茶园土壤真菌群落结构及功能的影响],"To study the soil fungal community compositions and functional groups under different management practices and slope positions, soil samples derived from the topsoil (0-20 cm) were collected from the upper, middle, and lower slope positions of conventional and organic tea gardens. High-throughput sequencing, functional predictions and the molecular ecological network analysis were performed to investigate the community structures, functional groups and ecological network of soil fungi, respectively. The two-way ANOVA including management practices and slope positions showed that the two-way interaction had no effect on the soil fungal community α-diversity. Regardless of the management practices and the slope positions, the predominant fungal phyla were Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota. Management practices did not change the compositions of dominant fungal species, but affected their relative abundance. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) shows that the soil fungal community structures differed significantly among different management practices. The community structures of soil fungi at different slope positions were noticeably different under the conventional planting pattern (P<0.05), but were similar under the organic planting pattern (P>0.05). The linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis shows that 37 biomarkers were very sensitive to the changes in the management, with different management practices enriching for different fungal populations. The numbers of degree, clustering, edges, degree centrality and closeness centrality of the fungal interaction network under the organic planting pattern were all higher than those under the conventional planting pattern, indicating that the fungal networks were more complex in the organic tea garden. Saprotrophic fungi were the dominant fungal group across all tea gardens (66.67%~70.18%). The effects of the management practices on soil fungal functions were obvious. Compared to those under the conventional planting pattern, the average abundance of endophyte-litter saprotroph-soil saprotroph, wood saprotroph and animal pathogen-endophyte-plant pathogen-undefined saprotroph significantly increased, but the average abundance of undefined saprotroph, plant pathogen and animal pathogen-plant pathogen-undefined saprotroph remarkably decreased. The spearman correlation analysis and the redundancy analysis (RDA) show that soil total phosphorus, available phosphorus, total potassium, organic matter, cation exchange capacity and pH were the main factors affecting the abundance and diversity of the soil fungal community.

1267,Management practice and soil properties affect plant productivity and root biomass in endophyte-symbiotic and endophyte-free meadow fescue grasses,"IntroductionPesticides are increasingly used in intensely managed agro-environments, with an increasingly acknowledged impact on crop production, root establishment and plant resilience. At the same time management practices are intensified with the goal to maximize productivity.Materials and MethodsIn a greenhouse, we studied the effects of three mowing regimes (uncut, and cutting 5 or 15 cm) employed three times during the season on root and shoot biomass and chlorophyll content of the cool-season grass Festuca pratensis (meadow fescue) growing in soil with a history of glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) use, the corresponding control soil, and sterilized control soil. Half of the plants hosted a systemic and vertically transmitted fungal endophyte, Epichlo & euml; uncinata, which is known to promote host grass growth.ResultsEndophyte symbiosis did not affect any tested plant parameters. Cutting the plants to 5 cm decreased both root and cumulative shoot biomass. Herbicide soil history, together with intense cutting (5 cm), caused a decrease in shoot biomass and lowered the chlorophyll content. Surprisingly, soil sterilization boosted shoot biomass and chlorophyll concentrations during less intense cutting (15 cm) and noncutting when compared to the control soil. Root biomass reduced in uncut plants when growing in soil with a history of glyphosate use.ConclusionOur results indicate that GBH residues in the soil can diminish shoot biomass when grass is frequently cut.

The role of the seed-borne fungi in seed decay or survival needs to be determined to find solutions for reducing the weed seed banks in environmentally friendly ways. In this study, changes of the fungal microbiome after seed burial were determined in two economically important weed species, wild oat and barnyard grass. Seeds collected in different populations were buried in two sites and exhumed at intervals over the period of 1.5 years to test the seed fate. Epiphytic and endophytic fungal microbiota of seeds was characterised using both culture-based approach and NGS of ITS1 region. The proportion of visually intact seeds and decayed seeds was different between the two burial sites. The observed species richness of the isolated epiphytic fungi was higher in the fresh compared to the buried seeds. Fungal taxa determined by NGS amplicon sequencing only partly coincided with the isolated fungi, revealing higher diversity in buried seeds. The dynamic of taxonomic structure of the fungal community was less pronounced in wild oat seeds compared to the barnyard grass seeds, where both endophytic and epiphytic communities were significantly different in the buried seeds and differed between the burial sites.

2087,Changes in Neotyphodium coenophialum infestation levels in tall fescue pastures due to different grazing pressures,"Infection of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb,) with the mutualistic fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum (Morgan-Jones & Gems) Glenn, Bacon & Hanlin results in numerous biochemical and physiological changes that increase host persistence. This study was conducted to determine effects of steer (Bos taurus L.) grazing on changes in endophyte infestation levels of tall fescue pastures, Eighteen 1.2-ha pastures were seeded in 1992 in 20-cm drill rows involving combinations of high, medium, or low grazing pressure and 'Ky 31' tall fescue infested with N. coenophialum at four levels ranging from endophyte-free (E-) to 80% infestation (E+), Pastures were grazed for about 10 mo. each year from fall 1993 until summer 1996, although animals on some of the high grazing pressure pastures occasionally had to be removed because of insufficient forage, Endophyte levels were monitored yearly with protein-A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PAS ELISA).

15652,Geographic distribution and ecological functions of Tetraplosphaeriaceae; [四绺孢球腔菌科真菌地理分布及其生态学功能],"Based on the multigenetic phylogenetic analysis of ITS, LSU, rpb2, tef1 and tub2, seven endophytic fungi of Pleosporales in plants of Poaceae in Yunnan Province were identified as Tetraploa and Pseudotetraploa of Tetraplosphaeriaceae and a taxonomically uncertain genus of Pleosporales. Two endophytes of Tetraploa and Pseudotetraploa were found to have stronger activities of cellulase and laccase, while the isolates of genera incertae sedis displayed comparatively weak cellulase activities and without laccase activity on sodium carboxymethyl cellulose medium and guaiacol medium, indicating that the activities of cellulose and lignin degradation abilities were different between taxa. Multiple correspondence analysis showed that the colonization of genera of Tetraplosphaeriaceae were correlated with host, isolated source and geographical location. Tetraploa and Pseudotetraploa can survive as endophytes in living healthy plants, and they also can be isolated from litter and soil.

38,Endophytic Fungal Community of Pinus densiflora Infected by Different Incidences of Sphaeropsis sapinea in a Mixed Coniferous Forest,"Shoot blight of pine caused by Sphaeropsis sapinea is a serious threat to the health of Pinus densiflora. However, little is known about the effect of S. sapinea on the structure of endophytic fungal communities in needles of P. densiflora. In this study, the diversity and structure of the endophytic fungal communities associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic needles of P. densiflora were investigated. Needles of P. densiflora were sampled from mixed coniferous forests, and high through-put sequencing was used to determine the diversity and community structure of endophytic fungi. The results demonstrated that endophytic fungal abundance increased when the lesion length was longer, and the endophytic fungal diversity showed an upward trend as the infection of S. sapinea worsened. The dominant genera of endophytic fungi in asymptomatic needles of P. densiflora in mixed coniferous forest was Paraconiothyrium and Selenophoma.

19095,Roles of endophytic fungi in medicinal plant abiotic stress response and TCM quality development.,"Medicinal plants, as medicinal materials and important drug components, have been used in traditional and folk medicine for ages. However, being sessile organisms, they are seriously affected by extreme environmental conditions and abiotic stresses such as salt, heavy metal, temperature, and water stresses. Medicinal plants usually produce specific secondary metabolites to survive such stresses, and these metabolites can often be used for treating human diseases. Recently, medicinal plants have been found to partner with endophytic fungi to form a long-term, stable, and win-win symbiotic relationship. Endophytic fungi can promote secondary metabolite accumulation in medicinal plants. The close relationship can improve host plant resistance to the abiotic stresses of soil salinity, drought, and extreme temperatures. Their symbiosis also sheds light on plant growth and active compound production. Here, we show that endophytic fungi can improve the host medicinal plant resistance to abiotic stress by regulating active compounds, reducing oxidative stress, and regulating the cell ion balance. We also identify the deficiencies and burning issues of available studies and present promising research topics for the future.

53,The Relationship between Endophytic Fungi of Chimonanthus praecox and Volatile Metabolites under Different Circadian Rhythms and Blooming Stages,"Chimonanthus praecox is an aromatic plant that flowers in winter. The composition of the floral volatiles of C. praecox is influenced by different blooming stages, circadian rhythms and species. However, the relationship between floral volatiles and plant endophytic fungi has not received much research attention. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing technology to compare and analyze the changes in the structure and diversity of the endophytic fungal communities in C. praecox under different circadian rhythms (7:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., and 7:00 p.m.) and in different blooming stages (unopened flowers and opened flowers). The endophytic fungi of C. praecox consisted of nine phyla, 34 classes, 79 orders, 181 families, 293 genera, and 397 species, and Ascomycota was the dominant phylum. Under a diurnal rhythm, the diversity (Chao1 and Shannon indices) of endophytic fungi gradually decreased in the unopened flowers, while an increasing and then decreasing trend was found for the opened flowers. In the different blooming stages, the endophytic fungal diversity was significantly higher at 7:00 a.m. in the unopened flowers compared to the opened flowers. Humidity was the key factors that significantly affected the endophytic fungal diversity and community. Moreover, 11 endophytic fungi were significantly positively or negatively correlated with seven floral volatiles. In conclusion, the community structure and diversity of endophytic fungi in C. praecox were affected by the different blooming stages and circadian rhythms, and a correlation effect related to floral volatiles was found, but there are other possible reasons that were not tested.

5864,Microbiomes across root compartments are shaped by inoculation with a fungal biological control agent,"While the endosphere is a hotspot for close interactions between plants and microbes, the influence of different components of the root endosphere on microbiome composition are seldom explored. This study used the fleshy taprooted plant, American Ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) and the recently discovered beneficial microbe, Trichoderma atroviride strain HB20111, to provide insights into microbiome shifts across plant-soil compartment niches including the bulk soil, rhizosphere, epidermis, cortex and vascular tissue. Trichoderma impacted both plant growth and microbiome composition. The survival rate of ginseng plants significantly increased from 70.8% to 85.4%, following Trichoderma treatment while root biomass production increased by 1.2 to 1.5 times compared with the uninoculated control. Microbiome diversity gradually decreased in niches from the bulk soil outside the root toward the vascular tissue, indicating increased selection and suggesting the possibility of a Trichoderma-driven induced systemic or localized resistance.

763,Mutualism effectiveness of a fungal endophyte in an annual grass is impaired by ozone,"Ozone is an increasing tropospheric contaminant of climate change. Exposure to ozone may affect the symbiotic relationship between plants and beneficial microorganisms. In particular, the herbivore resistance mechanism conferred by fungal endophytes (defensive mutualism) may be affected, as any of the ozone-triggered effects (such as elicitation of defence mechanisms against biotrophic fungi or oxidative stress in the apoplastic space) may target the symbiont. Symbiotic and non-symbiotic Lolium multiflorum plants were exposed to ozone for two consecutive days (2h per day), after which half were infested with 10 aphids (Rhopalosiphum padi). We measured variables related to performance of plants, the endophyte symbiont (alkaloids) and the herbivores. Aphid populations were smaller on symbiotic plants than in non-symbiotic plants in low-ozone conditions. However, this difference disappeared in exposed plants to high-ozone conditions. Under low-ozone conditions, structure of aphid populations on endophyte-symbiotic plants was characterized by a low number of nymphs and a high number of adults. This pattern was not observed with high-ozone exposure. Level of fungal alkaloids (lolines) was not affected by either ozone or herbivory. Results indicate that ozone impairs the grass-endophyte symbiosis without affecting production of alkaloids generally linked with aphids' response to endophyte presence. Since neither plant biomass nor alkaloid level were affected by ozone, other ozone-mediated mechanisms at molecular or biochemical level may underlie plant-herbivore interaction mediated by fungal endophytes.

Sampling was carried out at three times, in April (budbreak), June (full vegetation) and October (leaf fall), on trees that were either healthy or in decline, and on three organs: current-year twigs, with a diameter less than 2 cm, buds, and leaves. The experiment was done in an approximately 20-year-old oak forest at an altitude of 350-400 m above sea level. Three healthy and three declining trees were sampled annually in 1999 and 2000.

9043,Composition and Assembly of the Endophytic Fungal Community of Alpine Rhododendron Hosts Along Elevation Gradients,"Alpine mountain ecosystems are highly sensitive to global warming and threatened by climate change. Elevation gradients are frequently used as space-for-time surrogates for climate change in mountain ecosystems due to their correspondence with climate variables over short geographic distances. However, the distribution patterns of fungal communities in perennial woody plants along elevations in this ecosystem and how elevation and host identity affect them remain unclear. In this work, we used Illumina MiSeq DNA sequencing technology to study the rhizosphere soil fungal community and root and leaf endophytic fungal community assembly of alpine Rhododendron communities across a 3,100- to 4,100-m elevation gradient on Jiaozi Mountain, Southwest China. The abundance and diversity of fungi in different compartments varied among elevation gradients and hosts. The fungal community assembly in each compartment was mainly influenced by stochastic processes. However, the contribution of homogeneous selection, dispersal limitation, and drift varied among host identities and elevations in different compartments. The diversity and composition of rhizosphere soil, root, and leaf guilds and the overall abundance of fungal functional groups tracked the Rhododendron host identity more closely than elevation did. Most indicator taxa of fungi were putative saprotrophs. These findings will improve our understanding of the maintenance of alpine Rhododendron communities along elevation gradients.

They were identified as cembrene (3,7,11-trimethyl-14-(1-methylethyl) -1,3,6,10-cyclotetradecatetraene), diisooctyl phthalate (1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid diisooctylester) and ethyl oleate (9-octadecenoic acid-ethyl ester) by infrared spectra (IR), mass spectra (MS) and 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Their antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans were examined. Results show that all of the three compounds could inhibit the growth of those pathogenic bacteria. Especially, cembrene showed stronger inhibition to S. aureus, B. subtilis and C. albicans.
