9910,Fungal endophytic communities associated to the phyllosphere of grapevine cultivars under different types of management,"Fungal endophytes present in different asymptomatic grapevine plants (Vitis vinifera L.) located in different vineyards within Alentejo, a highly important viticulture region in Portugal, were identified in this study. Sampled grapevine plants included the three most representative cultivars in the region, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Aragonez, growing under two different modes of management, conventional and biological. Sixteen fungal taxa were identified through sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region. Total number of endophytic fungi isolated showed significant differences both in management mode and in cultivars, with higher numbers in grapevines under conventional mode and from Syrah cultivar. The composition of fungal endophytic communities did not show significant differences among cultivars, but differences were observed between fungal communities isolated from grapevines under biological or conventional modes. The most fungal taxa isolated from grapevines cultivated under biological mode were Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium sp., and Nigrospora oryzae, and under conventional mode Botrytis cinerea, Epicoccum nigrum, and Epicoccum sp. These differences suggest that the different products used in grapevine production have impacts in fungal endophytic composition. Further investigation of the identified fungi with respect to their antagonistic characteristics and potential use in plant protection to ensure food safety is now in course.

3609,Microbial communities in crop phyllosphere and root endosphere are more resistant than soil microbiota to fertilization,"Crop harbors diverse microbial communities that profoundly influence host health and agricultural productivity. Crop habitat is a dynamic and heterogeneous environment, and thus crop microbiota may display spatial organization across different compartments. However, impacts of long-term fertilization, as a common agricultural practice, on the assembly of crop microbiota and their relationships with crop yield and quality remain largely unresolved. Here, we collected sorghum roots and leaves, and rhizosphere and bulk soils, from an eight-year field experiment with multiple fertilization regimes, and characterized sorghum-associated microbiomes by amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS region. Rhizosphere and bulk soils harbored significantly higher diversity of bacteria and fungi than phyllosphere and root endophytes, and the microbial community composition significantly differed across the four compartments. Fertilization significantly influenced the diversity and compositions of sorghum-associated microbial communities, but had more pronounced effects on rhizosphere and bulk soil microbiomes through altering the relative abundances of some major microbial bio-markers. Bacterial genera Lysobacter, Acidibacter, Steroidobacter, RB41, and Blastococcus, and fungal genera Fusarium and Guehomyces were the dominant microbial predictors of sorghum yield and protein content. Structural equation models revealed that fertilization had a positive and indirect effect on sorghum yield and protein content through influencing the microbial diversity in rhizosphere and bulk soils. We provide novel evidence that microbial communities in sorghum phyllosphere and root endosphere are more resistant than soil microbiota to long-term fertilization, and soil microbiota are important predictors of sorghum yield and protein content.","Sun, AQ; Jiao, XY; Chen, QL; Wu, AL; Zheng, Y; Lin, YX; He, JZ; Hu, HW",SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,2021,10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.108113,0.980749021847594,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999808777724008,1.9122227599229e-4,0.99999999999775,2.25042207091519e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,Sorghum,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Poaceae,NA,Sorghum,ACCEPTED,Sorghum,NA,NA,genus,sorghum,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,molecular,roots; leaves; root,3,South Africa; United States,United States,South Africa,NA,NA,FALSE,South Africa; United States,0.99999999999775,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_002
9312,Functional roles of fungal endophytes in host fitness during stress conditions,"Fungal endophytes live symbiotically within healthy plant tissues and found to be associated with all host plants studied till date in all natural ecosystems with varied geographical areas. These microbes benefit the plants by conferring resistance to several biotic and abiotic stresses and also influence the soil rhizosphere environment. The endophytic fungi may affect plant phenotypic and functional traits by promoting nutrient/mineral uptake and alters defensive pathways. The importance of fungal endophytes to ecosystem functioning via soil processes is also aroused increasing interest during the past decade as host-fungal interaction affects ecology, distribution, and diversity of plants. The present review ascertains the role of fungal endophytes on host ecological fitness during different stress conditions.","Naik, BS",SYMBIOSIS,2019,10.1007/s13199-019-00635-1,0.972289232243757,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997472959292733,0.00252704070726745,0.999999999996791,3.20898863037655e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NO_MATCH,NA,NA,NA,none,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,0.999999999996791,High (≥0.9),0,None (0 types),No species,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | No species,,,,,,,VAL_003
277,Diversity and antimicrobial activity of endophytic fungi isolated from Securinega suffruticosa in the Yellow River Delta,"Securinega suffruticosa (Pall.) Rehd is an excellent natural secondary shrub in the Shell Islands of Yellow River Delta. The roots of S. suffruticosa have high medicinal value and are used to treat diseases, such as neurasthenia and infant malnutrition. Any organism that is isolated from this species is of immense interest due to its potential novel bioactive compounds. In this research, the distribution and diversity of culturable endophytic fungi in S. suffruticosa were studied, and the endophytic fungi with antimicrobial activity were screened. A total of 420 endophytic fungi isolates were obtained from the S. suffruticosa grown in Shell Islands, from which 20 genera and 35 species were identified through morphological and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analyses. Chaetomium, Fusarium, Cladosporium, and Ceratobasidium were the dominant genera. The high species richness S (42), Margalef index D' (5.6289), Shannon-Wiener index H' (3.1000), Simpson diversity index D-s (0.9459), PIE index (0.8670), and evenness Pielou index J (0.8719) and a low dominant index lambda (0.0541) indicated the high diversity of endophytic fungi in S. suffruticosa, the various species of endophytic fungi with obvious tissue specificity. The inhibition percentages of the 12 species of such endophytic fungi against Colletotrichum siamense were 3.6%-26.3%. C. globosum, Fusarium sp.3, and C. ramotenellum had a high antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) were between 0.5 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL. Alkaloid content detection indicated that endophytic fungi had a high alkaloid content, whereas the alkaloid contents of C. globosum and Fusarium sp.3 reached 0.231% and 0.170%, respectively. Members belonging to the endophytic fungal community in the S. suffruticosa of Shell Islands that may be used as antagonists and antibacterial agents for future biotechnology applications were identified for the first time.","Du, W; Yao, ZG; Li, JL; Sun, CL; Xia, JB; Wang, BG; Shi, DL; Ren, LL",PLOS ONE,2020,10.1371/journal.pone.0229589,0.979689381983151,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999877235493897,1.2276450610285e-4,0.999999999979638,2.03617123162303e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,colletotrichum siamense,colletotrichum siamense,8184256,Colletotrichum siamense,Fungi,Ascomycota,Glomerellaceae,Colletotrichum,Colletotrichum siamense,ACCEPTED,Colletotrichum siamense,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,roots,1,United States,United States,NA,NA,river,FALSE,United States; river,0.999999999979638,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_004
9343,"Myxotrichum persicum sp. nov. , and two new combinations in the genus Myxotrichum","We describe Myxotrichum persicum sp. nov. as a seed endophyte of Aegilops triuncialis in Lorestan province of Iran, using morphological traits and sequences of the internal transcribed spacer regions 1 and 2 including the intervening 5.8S nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS) and partial nuclear 28S ribosomal DNA (LSU) regions. Myxotrichum persicum is differentiated from its closest relative, M. deflexum, by possessing smaller ascomata bearing much shorter, usually unbranched appendages, and smaller, ellipsoidal to fusiform, smooth-walled ascospores. Based on morphology and the multilocus phylogeny of ITS, LSU, MCM7 and RPB1, we herein propose to combine two species of Malbranchea, namely M. circinata and M. flavorosea, into the genus Myxotrichum as Myxotrichum circinatum and M. flavoroseum, respectively.","Mehrabi, M; Asgari, B; Zare, R",PHYTOTAXA,2024,10.11646/phytotaxa.649.1.5,0.879830441886134,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999999998426172,1.5738277740991702e-9,0.99999999997513,2.48701059746281e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,aegilops triuncialis,aegilops triuncialis,5289793,Aegilops triuncialis,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Poaceae,Aegilops,Aegilops triuncialis,ACCEPTED,Aegilops triuncialis,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,seed,1,Iran,NA,Iran,NA,NA,FALSE,Iran,0.99999999997513,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_005

Average total herbage yields were similar for all treatments in each of the three years, ranging from 12.8 to 13.9 t DM ha(-1). Pasture growth rates in all treatments were lowest in the first summer/autumn after drilling, averaging 17 kg DM ha(-1) day(-1) for 90 days, coinciding with the highest herbage concentrations of lolitrem B (2.37 to 3.04 mu g g(-1) DM) in the high-endophyte ryegrass. Ergovaline herbage concentrations rarely exceeded 1 mu g g(-1) DM and were highest (1.6 mu g g(-1) DM) in high-endophyte ryegrass pastures at the start of the third summer (December 1995), probably because of a high seed-head content (30% of DM). Contamination of endophyte-free ryegrass areas with volunteer endophyte-infected ryegrass was rapid, averaging 26, 41, and 50% of plants after the first, second, and third years from sowing, respectively. Further research is required to identify sources of this contamination and management strategies to maintain purity of endophyte-free ryegrass or ryegrass containing novel endophytes.","Thom, ER; Clark, DA; Waugh, CD",NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,1999,10.1080/00288233.1999.9513375,0.884866556253103,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997496097521776,0.00250390247822365,0.999999999970662,2.93376434257198e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,lolium perenne,lolium perenne,2706241,Lolium perenne,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Poaceae,Lolium,Lolium perenne,ACCEPTED,Lolium perenne,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,scale; seed,2,New Zealand,New Zealand,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,New Zealand,0.999999999970662,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_006
17371,"Effector candidates in the secretome of Piriformospora indica, a ubiquitous plant-associated fungus.","One of the emerging systems in plant-microbe interaction is the study of proteins, referred to as effectors, secreted by microbes in order to modulate host cells function and structure and to promote microbial growth on plant tissue. Current knowledge on fungal effectors derives mainly from biotrophic and hemibiotrophic plant fungal pathogens that have a limited host range. Here, we focus on effectors of Piriformospora indica, a soil borne endophyte forming intimate associations with roots of a wide range of plant species. Complete genome sequencing provides an opportunity to investigate the role of effectors during the interaction of this mutualistic fungus with plants.

1546,Spatial responses of two herbivore groups to a geometrid larva on mountain birch,"Direct or plant-mediated interactions between herbivores may modify their spatial distribution among and within plants. In this study, we examined the effect of a leaf-chewing geometrid, the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata), on two different herbivore groups, leaf rolling Deporaus betulae weevils and Eriocrania spp. leafminers, both feeding on mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii). The exact locations of herbivores within tree canopies were mapped during three successive summers. In the first 2 years, some trees were artificially colonized by eggs of the autumnal moth to induce both rapid and delayed resistance in the foliage. The natural infection levels of the pathogenic rust fungus (Melampsoridium betulinum), potentially involved in species interactions, were also recorded. At the level of the whole tree, the density of D. betulae leaf rolls was lower in trees infested by the autumnal moth in the same year. However, the feeding locations within trees were partly segregated: D. betulae favoured shadier branches, while E. autumnata preferred the sunny parts of the canopy. The autumnal moth did not affect current- or following-year density of leafminers at the tree or branch level. Trees infected by rust had fewer leafminers in the same summer than noninfected trees. There were no interaction effects between defoliation by the autumnal moth and rust infection, and no delayed effects on the abundance of other herbivores the following year. Taken together, these findings suggest that the autumnal moth has a negative, partially plant-mediated impact on D. betulae, and can reduce the extent of current-year defoliation caused by D. betulae. This may be beneficial for the mountain birch, since the greater part of D. betulae damage occurs around or after the end of the larval period of the autumnal moth, which may be a critical time for tree recovery after moth outbreaks.","Riihimäki, J; Kaitaniemi, P; Ruohomäki, K",OECOLOGIA,2003,10.1007/s00442-002-1082-6,0.699451620787856,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.96390239259463,0.03609760740537,0.99999999994138,5.861955365560329e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,betula pubescens,betula pubescens,9118014,Betula pubescens,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Betulaceae,Betula,Betula pubescens,ACCEPTED,Betula pubescens,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,leaf; foliage; branches; canopy; branch,5,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States,0.99999999994138,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_008
2667,Short-Term Effects of Different Organic Amendments on Soil Fungal Composition,"Fungi play an essential role in recovering the quality and fertility of soil. There is a limited understating of the complex response of fungal diversity to different organic materials in clay loam soil. Here, we report the response of soil fungi toward the short-term application of manure (M), sugarcane straw (S), and sugarcane straw plus manure (MS), including no organic material control (CK) at two different time points (50 and 100 days after application). Illumina sequencing was used to examine the fungal communities. Our results reveal a significant shift among the soil fungal community structure associated with each organic material application. After both time points, amendments-especially M and MS-decreased the fungal richness and stimulated the copiotrophic fungal group (Ascomycota) compared to the control soil (CK) and S-amended soil. On the contrary, as compared to the M and MS-amended soils, the CK and S-amended soils at both time points increased the fungal richness and stimulated the oligotrophic fungal groups. Organic material use, especially M and MS, showed variable results regarding pathogenic fungi enhancing the abundance of Lophodermium and Cercophora and decreasing Fusarium. Concerning the abundance of plant-beneficial fungi, Mortierella was reduced, and Podospora was increased by M and MS input. FUNGuild showed that the amendment of organic materials efficiently declined the abundance of endophytes and plant pathogens, but also enhanced the animal pathogens in terms of abundance with respect to CK at two time points. This study could be useful to provide a novel understanding of the management of soil-borne pathogens by organic amendments for the sustainable production of short-term crops.","Tayyab, M; Islam, W; Lee, CG; Pang, ZQ; Khalil, F; Lin, S; Lin, WX; Zhang, H",SUSTAINABILITY,2019,10.3390/su11010198,0.964138270826355,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994940239003762,0.00505976099623799,0.999999999778075,2.21925255949884e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,Fusarium,Fungi,Ascomycota,Nectriaceae,NA,Fusarium,ACCEPTED,Fusarium,NA,NA,genus,fusarium,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,molecular,NA,0,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States,0.999999999778075,High (≥0.9),3,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_009
10518,Brefeldin A production by Phoma medicaginis in dead pre-colonized plant tissue:: a strategy for habitat conquest?,"Phoma medicaginis was isolated as the dominant endophyte from surface-sterilized shoots of Medicago sativa and M. lupulina growing outdoors. Plants were either symptomless or showed signs of infection in the shape of limited lesions which sometimes contained melanized pycnidial initials. Rapid colonization of host tissue and sporulation were observed within 9 d on dead plant material upon incubation in a moist chamber. Such colonized material, but not freshly harvested living tissue, contained brefeldin A (1.7 mug g(-1) D.w.). This toxin was also produced in pure culture (20 mg I-1) and in artificially inoculated autoclaved M. sativa stems (3 mg g(-1) D.W. =920 mug ml(-1)). The latter concentration of brefeldin A should be similar to that produced within a fruiting lesion of P. medicaginis and suppressed spore germination and growth of nine of 11 common phylloplane fungi tested. This metabolite may thus have a function in substrate defence after the switch from the endophytic to the saprotrophic period in the life-cycle of P. medicaginis following the death of infected host tissue.","Weber, RWS; Stenger, E; Meffert, A; Hahn, M",MYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH,2004,10.1017/S0953756204000243,0.827860372826166,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997213474930291,0.00278652506970871,0.999999998226982,1.7730180656983e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,medicago sativa,medicago sativa,9151957,Medicago sativa,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Fabaceae,Medicago,Medicago sativa,ACCEPTED,Medicago sativa,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,shoots; lesions; stems; lesion,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,0.999999998226982,High (≥0.9),3,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_010
1362,Differences in endophyte communities of introduced trees depend on the phylogenetic relatedness of the receiving forest,"Plant species sometimes perform extraordinarily well when introduced to new environments, through achieving higher growth rates, individual biomasses or higher densities in their receiving communities compared to their native range communities. One hypothesis proposed to explain enhanced performance in species' new environments is that their soil microbial communities may be different and provide greater benefit than microbial communities encountered in species' native environments. However, detailed descriptions of soil biota associated with species in both their native and introduced environments remain scarce. We established a global network of sites in regions where the tree species Pinus contorta has been introduced (Chile, New Zealand, Finland, Scotland and Sweden), as well as native range sites where the introduced populations originated (Canada and USA). We conducted pyrosequencing analysis to compare the root fungal endophyte communities associated with P.contorta in its native environments and in introduced environments with phylogenetically similar and dissimilar tree species (i.e. P.sylvestris in Europe and Nothofagus spp. in the Southern Hemisphere). Fungal communities associated with P.contorta consistently differed between its introduced and native environments. In Europe, P.contorta associated with the same community as P.sylvestris, where one particular species (Piloderma sphaerosporum) was particularly abundant relative to Canadian sites. In the Southern Hemisphere, P.contorta fungal communities were composed primarily of North American taxa and exhibited very little overlap with fungal communities associated with native Nothofagus spp.Synthesis. Our work shows that plants exhibit considerable plasticity in their interaction with fungi, by associating with different fungal communities across native and introduced environments. Our work also indicates that fungal communities associated with introduced plants can assemble through different mechanisms, that is by associating with existing fungal communities of phylogenetically close species, or through reassembly of co-introduced and co-invading fungi. The identification of different fungal communities in a plant species new environment provides an important step forward in understanding how soil biota may impact growth and invasion when a species is introduced to new environments.","Gundale, MJ; Almeida, JP; Wallander, H; Wardle, DA; Kardol, P; Nilsson, MC; Fajardo, A; Pauchard, A; Peltzer, DA; Ruotsalainen, S; Mason, B; Rosenstock, N",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2016,10.1111/1365-2745.12595,0.878560205553843,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999972993667548,2.70063324516871e-5,0.999999988919986,1.1080014017395e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,pinus contorta,pinus contorta,5285750,Pinus contorta,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Pinaceae,Pinus,Pinus contorta,ACCEPTED,Pinus contorta,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,root,1,USA; Canada; Scotland; Sweden; Finland; New Zealand; Chile,USA; Canada; Scotland; Sweden; Finland; New Zealand,Chile,europe,NA,FALSE,USA; Canada; Scotland; Sweden; Finland; New Zealand; Chile; europe; europe,0.999999988919986,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_011
13580,Effects of atmospheric pollutants on phyllosphere and endophytic fungi,"Focuses on 1) in vitro effects of dry and wet deposition of SO2 and O3 on phyllosphere and endophyte fungi; 2) impact of atmospheric SO2 on specific fungi when pre-inoculated on to host-plant seedlings; and 3) effect of open-air fumigation on phyllosphere and endophyte fungi. Complex interactions may occur between biotic factors (eg fungi and insects) and stresses due to different atmospheric pollutants, and the role of phyllosphere fungi in forest decline syndromes should be seen in this context. -P.J.Jarvis",Magan N.; Smith M.K.; Kirkwood I.A.,Fungi and environmental change,1996,10.1017/cbo9780511753190.008,0.847684645393567,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.875541552142212,0.124458447857788,0.999999981274576,1.87254236561074e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NO_MATCH,NA,NA,NA,none,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,0,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States,0.999999981274576,High (≥0.9),1,Low (1 type),No species,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | No species,,,,,,,VAL_012
5527,"Multi-Gene Phylogeny and Taxonomy of Hypoxylon (Hypoxylaceae, Ascomycota) from China","The Hypoxylon species play an important ecological role in tropical rainforest as wood-decomposers, and some might have benefical effects on their hosts as endophytes. The present work concerns a survey of the genus Hypoxylon from Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park of China. Four new species: H. wuzhishanense, H. hainanense, H. chrysalidosporum, and H. cyclobalanopsidis, were discovered based on a combination of morphological characteristics and molecular data. Hypoxylon wuzhishanense is characterized by Rust pulvinate stromata, amyloid apical apparatus and brown ascospores, with most of the perispore being indehiscent in 10% KOH. Hypoxylon hainanense has effused-pulvinate and Violet stromata, amyloid apical apparatus, light-brown to brown ascospores with straight germ slit and dehiscent perispore. Hypoxylon chrysalidosporum is distinguished by glomerate to pulvinate stromata, highly reduced or absent inamyloid apical apparatus, and light-brown to brown ascospores with very conspicuous coil-like ornamentation. Hypoxylon cyclobalanopsidis has Livid Purple pulvinate stromata, highly reduced amyloid apical apparatus, faint bluing, brown ascospores and dehiscent perispore, and it grows on dead branches of Cyclobalanopsis. Detailed descriptions, illustrations, and contrasts with morphologically similar species are provided. Phylogenetic analyses inferred from ITS, RPB2, LSU, and beta-tubulin sequences confirmed that the four new species are distinct within the genus Hypoxylon.","Ma, HX; Song, ZK; Pan, XY; Li, Y; Yang, ZE; Qu, Z",DIVERSITY-BASEL,2022,10.3390/d14010037,0.850428508707803,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999598383889507,4.0161611049309e-4,0.999999970332221,2.96677792333e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,Beta,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Amaranthaceae,NA,Beta,ACCEPTED,Beta,NA,NA,genus,beta,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,wood; branches,2,China,NA,China,NA,tropical; rainforest,FALSE,China; tropical; rainforest; tropical; rainforest,0.999999970332221,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_013

Effects on the bacterium grown in vitro with a combined nitrogen source were not necessarily reflected in the nitrogen‐fixing capacity of excised nodulated roots of white clover. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation was affected by thiram, oxycarboxin and “Ethylan CP”, but was unchanged by benomyl, captan, carbendazim, carboxin, dodine, dimethirimol, ethirimol, tridemorph, triforine or thiophanate‐methyl.

3035,Genotypic variation in Norway spruce correlates to fungal communities in vegetative buds,"The taxonomically diverse phyllosphere fungi inhabit leaves of plants. Thus, apart from the fungi's dispersal capacities and environmental factors, the assembly of the phyllosphere community associated with a given host plant depends on factors encoded by the host's genome. The host genetic factors and their influence on the assembly of phyllosphere communities under natural conditions are poorly understood, especially in trees. Recent work indicates that Norway spruce (Picea abies) vegetative buds harbour active fungal communities, but these are hitherto largely uncharacterized. This study combines internal transcribed spacer sequencing of the fungal communities associated with dormant vegetative buds with a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 478 unrelated Norway spruce trees. The aim was to detect host loci associated with variation in the fungal communities across the population, and to identify loci correlating with the presence of specific, latent, pathogens. The fungal communities were dominated by known Norway spruce phyllosphere endophytes and pathogens. We identified six quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with the relative abundance of the dominating taxa (i.e., top 1% most abundant taxa). Three additional QTLs associated with colonization by the spruce needle cast pathogen Lirula macrospora or the cherry spruce rust (Thekopsora areolata) in asymptomatic tissues were detected. The identification of the nine QTLs shows that the genetic variation in Norway spruce influences the fungal community in dormant buds and that mechanisms underlying the assembly of the communities and the colonization of latent pathogens in trees may be uncovered by combining molecular identification of fungi with GWAS.","Elfstrand, M; Zhou, LH; Baison, J; Olson, Å; Lundén, K; Karlsson, B; Wu, HX; Stenlid, J; García-Gil, MR",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2020,10.1111/mec.15314,0.877208892107549,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999562667428176,4.3733257182415e-4,0.99999996235711,3.76428902493231e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,picea abies,picea abies,5284884,Picea abies,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Pinaceae,Picea,Picea abies,ACCEPTED,Picea abies,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,molecular,leaves; buds,2,Norway,Norway,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,Norway,0.99999996235711,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_015
15681,Secondary metabolites of endophytic fungi from newbouldia laevis and cassia tora leaves: Prospecting for new antimicrobial agents,"Aim: This study tries to find new antimicrobial agents using some Nigerian plants. Background: Antimicrobial compounds from fungi endophytes have shown great promise in mitigating the threats of resistant pathogens. Objective: The study evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial property of secondary metabolites of endophytic fungi isolated from Newbouldia laevis and Cassia tora leaves. Methods: Ten endophytic fungi were isolated from the two plants’ leaves and later fermented on local rice for 21 days. Thereafter, their secondary metabolites were extracted using ethyl acetate. The antibacterial activity of the extracts on the test organisms were determined using agar diffusion and agar dilution methods, while the bioactive constituents were identified using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detector. Results: Nine of the crude extracts (NL1, NL3, NL6, NL10, NL12, CT2, CT7, CT9 and CT10) of the fungi isolates inhibited at least one of the microorganisms studied with maximum and minimum inhibition-zone-diameter of 14 mm and 2 mm, respectively while CT1 did not inhibit any of the tested microorganisms at tested concentrations. The extracts exhibited good antifungal activity, inhibiting the growth of both C. albicans and Trichophyton tested with an inhibition-zone-diameter ranging between 4-8 mm and 7-14 mm, respectively. The endophytic fungi extracts-CT2 and NL1-exhibited the best antimicrobial activity, inhibiting most of the tested microorganisms. HPLC-DAD analysis of the endophytic fungal extracts identified some classes of compounds such as catechin derivatives, benzoic acid derivatives and apigenin, which were previously reported to have antimicrobial potentials. Conclusion: Newbouldia laevis and Cassia tora leaves house endophytic fungi capable of yielding secondary metabolites with potential as anti-infective agents. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.",Amaechi A.A.; Oli A.N.; Okezie U.M.; Adejumo S.A.; Abba C.C.; Okeke I.J.; Okoye F.B.C.,Recent Advances in Anti-Infective Drug Discovery,2021,10.2174/1574891X15999201222152646,0.941921950729321,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99866412637451,0.00133587362548998,0.99999986498402,1.35015980284869e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,newbouldia laevis,newbouldia laevis,4091370,Newbouldia laevis,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Bignoniaceae,Newbouldia,Newbouldia laevis,ACCEPTED,Newbouldia laevis,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,leaves,1,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States,0.99999986498402,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_016
10945,Evaluation of phytotoxic potential and identification of phytotoxic compounds in Rumex maritimus,"Rumex maritimus (Polygonaceae) is an annual herb and is well known for its use in medicinal treatments. Although the pharmacological properties of R. maritimus are well documented, no phytotoxic activity of R. maritimus has yet been found. Therefore, we investigated the phytotoxic potential of R. maritimus to identify phytotoxic compounds. Inhibitory activity was found in aqueous methanol extracts of R. maritimus on the seedling growth of cress, rapeseed, barnyard grass, and foxtail fescue, in which inhibition increased with increasing extract concentration. Two compounds were isolated using chromatography, and using spectroscopy their structure was determined as 5,7-dihydroxyphthalide and altechromone A. 5,7-Dihydroxyphthalide significantly inhibited cress seedling growth by 27.2-43.0% of control seedlings at 3mM, whereas altechromone A inhibited seedling growth by 65.4-66.3% at 0.01mM. The concentrations required for 50% inhibition of cress seedling growth were 1.73-2.48mM for 5,7-dihydroxyphthalide and 0.66-1.41mM for altechromone A. These results indicate that the compounds 5,7-dihydroxyphthalide and altechromone A may contribute, to a certain extent, to the phytotoxic activity of R. maritimus.","Islam, MS; Iwasaki, A; Suenaga, K; Kato-Noguchi, H",PLANT BIOSYSTEMS,2018,10.1080/11263504.2017.1338630,0.972318831123357,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.978538897651897,0.0214611023481026,0.999999852529865,1.47470134992389e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,rumex maritimus,rumex maritimus,2888980,Rumex maritimus,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Polygonaceae,Rumex,Rumex maritimus,ACCEPTED,Rumex maritimus,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,NA,0.999999852529865,High (≥0.9),2,Medium (2 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_017
18743,Genetic Blueprint for Stringent Response in Betaproteobacterial Aromatoleum/Azoarcus/Thauera Cluster.,"The Aromatoleum/Azoarcus/Thauera (AAT) cluster comprises anaerobic degradation specialists (Aromatoleum, Thauera) and N2-fixing endophytes (Azoarcus). Omics-based and genetic studies with associated model strains implicate stringent response (SR) in adaptation to nutrient limitation and plant colonization. SR is well-studied in standard bacteria such as Escherichia coli and known as adaptive strategy to nutrient limitations by adjusting e.g., transcription and stress response. SR involves the alarmone (p)ppGpp, whose cellular level is controlled by the synthetases/hydrolases RelA/SpoT and the noncanonical transcription factor DksA, whose interaction with RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding of (p)ppGpp enhances. DksA-mediated SR occurs across Proteobacteria and other phylogenetic groups such as Myxococcia and Spirochaetia, mostly applying to pathogens. Furthermore, all three DksA variants (four, two or one cysteine residue(s) for Zn2+-binding) were found. Genes encoding SR components are present in all studied 37 genomes representing 31 species from the AAT cluster. Each genome encodes a synthesizing RelA, a hydrolyzing SpoT, a four cysteine-containing DksA, and mostly also a one cysteine-containing DksA. Opposing functions of RelA and SpoT in Aromatoleum aromaticum EbN1T, Aromatoleum sp. strain CIB, Azoarcus olearius BH72, and Thauera aromatica K172T (also entire AAT cluster) are implicated by full conservation of amino acids (E and D vs. 2H2D motif and ED diad) essential for catalysis by their synthetase versus hydrolase domains. Likewise, functionality of the predicted C4-type DksAs from these four model strains was visually assessed by structural modeling and comparison of key features (binding sites for Zn2+/(p)ppGpp; CC tip for RNAP interaction) to those of the available E. coli DksA cryo-EM structure. SR as a global adaptation strategy should contribute to the success of the AAT cluster in its distinct habitats: complex and highly variable soils/sediments (high molecular and microbial diversity, fluctuating nutrient availabilities and redox states) of the free-living degradation specialists versus the defined endorhizosphere (more stable conditions, less complex community) of the endophytes. A noteworthy exception is Aromatoleum sp. strain CIB by combining degradation and endophytic features. Thus, future investigations into the role of SR in the habitat success of such bacteria reflecting their divergent environmental niches are needed as well as promising.",Becker P; Ruickoldt J; Wendler P; Reinhold-Hurek B; Rabus R,Microbial physiology,2025,10.1159/000546200,0.827165695949433,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.774960931366196,0.225039068633804,0.999999831962473,1.68037526893094e-7,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NO_MATCH,NA,NA,NA,none,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,NA,0,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States,0.999999831962473,High (≥0.9),2,Medium (2 types),No species,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | No species,,,,,,,VAL_018

4912,Multi-approach analysis of the diversity in Colletotrichum cliviae sensu lato,"Colletotrichum cliviae is a fungal species reported both as pathogen and endophyte with broad geographical distribution. Some purported isolates of this species have been assigned to different taxa, including Colletotrichum aracearum, Colletotrichum orchidearum and Colletotrichum. sichuanensis, for which a preliminary analysis of extensive multilocus (ACT, GAPDH, ITS, TUB2) data in this study revealed high sequence similarity with C. cliviae. We further reassessed the species delineation by using the coalescent method of the generalized mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) and Poisson Tree Processes (PTP). Single and multilocus gene trees strongly supported a C. cliviae s. lat. clade including the four species. This clade unfolded eight subclades grouped into three distinct lineages, but no monophyly of any of the four species. GMYC and PTP analyses confidently supported the evolutionary independence of these lineages. C. sichuanensis and C. cliviae, except one isolate, formed the largest lineage. The second lineage was made up of isolates named C. aracearum and some of C. orchidearum sharing the haplotype and the third lineage accommodated two isolates named C. cliviae and C. orchidearum. This finding suggests the synonymization of C. sichuanensis with C. cliviae whereas the taxonomic status of C. aracearum and C. orchidearum still needs clarification. This study lays great stress upon the use of comprehensive data for sequence-based characterisation of species in the C. cliviae s. lat. It also presents the first report of C. cliviae in tropical Africa and on citrus host.","Douanla-Meli, C; Unger, JG; Langer, E",ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY,2018,10.1007/s10482-017-0965-9,0.957787066104252,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990910350593215,0.0090896494067849,0.999999748952089,2.51047911459246e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,colletotrichum aracearum,colletotrichum aracearum,9807321,Colletotrichum aracearum,Fungi,Ascomycota,Glomerellaceae,Colletotrichum,Colletotrichum aracearum,ACCEPTED,Colletotrichum aracearum,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,africa,tropical,FALSE,africa; tropical,0.999999748952089,High (≥0.9),3,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_020

11136,Resistance to triadimefon and benomyl: Dynamics and impact on managing cucurbit powdery mildew,"Frequency of fungicide-resistant strains of Podosphaera xanthii on pumpkins in New York before treatment varied from 3 to 80% for the demethylation inhibiting (DMI) fungicide triadimefon and from 0 to 48% for the benzimidazole fungicide benomyl between 1993 and 1996. When the initial frequency of triadimefon-resistant strains was less than 55%, one application of triadimefon plus chlorothalonil was effective. This application was made after reaching the action threshold of one leaf with powdery mildew symptoms per 50 old leaves (defined as the oldest third of the foliage). The frequency of triadimefon-resistant strains increased from 3 to 71% by 20 days after the first fungicide application in 1993. Triadimefon in the second application did not contribute to control. Loss of efficacy was due to resistance because, compared with triadimefon-treated pumpkins, pumpkins treated with other systemic fungicides were less severely infected by powdery mildew on abaxial leaf surfaces where the companion multi-site contact fungicide contributes little to control. Triadimefon was not effective in 1995 when 80% of the pathogen population was resistant before treatment. Benomyl was effective in 1995, but not in 1996 when 48% of the isolates tested were resistant to both benomyl and triadimefon before treatment. An in-field seedling assay was developed to determine local occurrence of resistant strains before the first treatment was needed. Although sensitivity of the pathogen population to the DMI fungicides myclobutanil and propiconazole also decreased after they were applied, these fungicides were more effective than triadimefon.","McGrath, MT; Shishkoff, N",PLANT DISEASE,2001,10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.2.147,0.881489840232616,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.797445556270847,0.202554443729153,0.999999511303005,4.8869699542653e-7,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain,podosphaera xanthii,podosphaera xanthii,NA,NA,Fungi,Ascomycota,Erysiphaceae,Podosphaera,Podosphaera fusca,SYNONYM,Podosphaera fusca,Podosphaera xanthii,Podosphaera fusca,species,NA,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,leaf; leaves; foliage,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,0.999999511303005,High (≥0.9),2,Medium (2 types),No species,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | No species,,,,,,,VAL_022

In order to expand the knowledge of fungi causing leaf spots in ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) in Sichuan, Yunnan, Chongqing, and Guizhou of southwestern China, a comprehensive survey was undertaken from 2015 to 2022. The survey discovered that Epicoccum leaf spot (ELS) was a common and widespread disease, more serious at the late stage of growth (after late May). Symptomatic leaf samples collected from the four different provinces were analyzed, and a total of 202 Epicoccum isolates were obtained. Based on both multilocus phylogeny (ITS, LSU, TUB2, and RPB2) and morphology, 10 Epicoccum species were finally identified, including three novel species (E. endololii sp. nov., E. lolii sp. nov., and E. loliicola sp. nov.), six new host records (E. draconis, E. endophyticum, E. oryzae, E. plurivorum, E. thailandicum, and E. tobaicum), and an unknown species (Epicoccum sp.1). Pathogenicity tests showed that E. endophyticum, E. endololii, and Epicoccum sp.1 were nonpathogenic to Italian ryegrass, which were confirmed as endophytes in this study; the other six species could infect Italian ryegrass and cause leaf lesions to different degrees, of which E. draconis was more aggressive (P <= 0.05). Coupled with the isolation rates and geographical distributions of these species, it was found that E. plurivorum was the predominant pathogen in Yunnan while E. oryzae and E. tobaicum were the predominant pathogens in the other three provinces. This work provides an initial understanding of the taxonomy, virulence, and distribution of Epicoccum species associated with ELS in southwestern China and lays a solid foundation for the diagnosis in the field and scientific control of ELS on Italian ryegrass.","Xu, ZT; Xu, LL; Liu, JQ; Chen, DY; Cui, HW; Xue, LH; Li, CJ",PLANT DISEASE,2024,10.1094/PDIS-06-23-1044-RE,0.964047878729758,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98601864574541,0.0139813542545903,0.999998180896028,1.81910397190066e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,lolium multiflorum,lolium multiflorum,4129708,Lolium multiflorum,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Poaceae,Lolium,Lolium multiflorum,ACCEPTED,Lolium multiflorum,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,leaf; lesions,2,China,NA,China,NA,NA,FALSE,China,0.999998180896028,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_023
19620,"General Limitations to Endophytic Entomopathogenic Fungi Use as Plant Growth Promoters, Pests and Pathogens Biocontrol Agents.","The multiple roles of fungal entomopathogens in host plants' growth promotion, pest and pathogen management have drawn huge attention for investigation. Endophytic species are known to influence various activities of their associated host plants, and the endophyte-colonized plants have been demonstrated to gain huge benefits from these symbiotic associations. The potential application of fungal endophytes as alternative to inorganic fertilizers for crop improvement has often been proposed. Similarly, various strains of insect pathogenic fungi have been formulated for use as mycopesticides and have been suggested as long-term replacement for the synthetic pesticides that are commonly in use. The numerous concerns about the negative effects of synthetic chemical pesticides have also driven attention towards developing eco-friendly pest management techniques. However, several factors have been underlined to be militating the successful adoption of entomopathogenic fungi and fungal endophytes as plant promoting, pests and diseases control bio-agents. The difficulties in isolation and characterization of novel strains, negative effects of geographical location, vegetation type and human disturbance on fungal entomopathogens, are among the numerous setbacks that have been documented. Although, the latest advances in biotechnology and microbial studies have provided means of overcoming many of these problems. For instance, studies have suggested measures for mitigating the negative effects of biotic and abiotic stressors on entomopathogenic fungi in inundative application on the field, or when applied in the form of fungal endophytes. In spite of these efforts, more studies are needed to be done to achieve the goal of improving the overall effectiveness and increase in the level of acceptance of entomopathogenic fungi and their products as an integral part of the integrated pest management programs, as well as potential adoption as an alternative to inorganic fertilizers and pesticides.",Bamisile BS; Siddiqui JA; Akutse KS; Ramos Aguila LC; Xu Y,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,10.3390/plants10102119,0.996216147435534,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.978819117964916,0.0211808820350841,0.999996068017573,3.93198242654158e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NO_MATCH,NA,NA,NA,none,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,0.999996068017573,High (≥0.9),1,Low (1 type),No species,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | No species,,,,,,,VAL_024
11781,Postglacial colonization history reflects in the genetic structure of natural populations of Festuca rubra in Europe,"We conducted a large-scale population genetic survey of genetic diversity of the host grass Festuca rubra s.l., which fitness can be highly dependent on its symbiotic fungus Epichloe festucae, to evaluate genetic variation and population structure across the European range. The 27 studied populations have previously been found to differ in frequencies of occurrence of the symbiotic fungus E. festucae and ploidy levels. As predicted, we found decreased genetic diversity in previously glaciated areas in comparison with nonglaciated regions and discovered three major maternal genetic groups: southern, northeastern, and northwestern Europe. Interestingly, host populations from Greenland were genetically similar to those from the Faroe Islands and Iceland, suggesting gene flow also between those areas. The level of variation among populations within regions is evidently highly dependent on the postglacial colonization history, in particular on the number of independent long-distance seed colonization events. Yet, also anthropogenic effects may have affected the population structure in F. rubra. We did not observe higher fungal infection rates in grass populations with lower levels of genetic variability. In fact, the fungal infection rates of E. festucae in relation to genetic variability of the host populations varied widely among geographical areas, which indicate differences in population histories due to colonization events and possible costs of systemic fungi in harsh environmental conditions. We found that the plants of different ploidy levels are genetically closely related within geographic areas indicating independent formation of polyploids in different maternal lineages.","von Cräutlein, M; Leinonen, PH; Korpelainen, H; Helander, M; Väre, H; Saikkonen, K",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2019,10.1002/ece3.4997,0.977432646469154,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995982867095872,0.00401713290412762,0.999993710305799,6.28969420068959e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,festuca rubra,festuca rubra,2704922,Festuca rubra,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Poaceae,Festuca,Festuca rubra,ACCEPTED,Festuca rubra,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,scale; seed,2,Iceland,Iceland,NA,europe,NA,FALSE,Iceland; europe,0.999993710305799,High (≥0.9),3,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_025
13324,Synergistic effect of fungicides on the incidence of seed mycoflora of okra,"Seeds of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) Moench) variety Arka anamika were treated with 5 fungicides including Anucop, Bavistin, Captan, Dithane M-45 and Vitavax with different doses (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3%) and the combination Anucop + Bavistin, Anucop + Captan, Anucop + Vitavax, Bavistin + Vitavax, Anucop + Dithane, Bavistin + Dithane, Bavistin + Captan, Captan + Vitavax, Anucop + Bavistin + Captan, Anucop + Bavistin + Dithane, Anucop + Captan + Vitavax, Bavistin + Captan + Vitavax were used to test their potency against the seed-borne fungal diseases. Among these, Anucop at a concentration of 0.3%, Bavistin @ 0.2%, Captan @ 0.3%, Dithane @ 0.3%, Vitavax @ 0.3% and their combinations, like Anucop + Bavistin, Anucop + Dithane, Bavistin + Dithane, Anucop + Captan + Vitavax, Bavistin + Captan + Vitavax were most effective in the improvement of crop both in greenhouse and field conditions. These chemicals at different doses and in combinations increased the total number of leaves, fruits, mean length, girth and biomass of fruits. Apart from these, the total number of seeds per fruit, seed density and weight and ascorbic acid content were also enhanced. These chemicals reduced the incidence of seed mycoflora, thereby enhancing the seed germination percentage and vigour index of the seedlings. © 2008 Asian Network for Scientific Information.",Begum M.; Lokesh S.,International Journal of Botany,2008,10.3923/ijb.2008.24.32,0.932537823645831,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99872998360785,0.00127001639215035,0.999992405375856,7.59462414434697e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,abelmoschus esculentus,abelmoschus esculentus,3152707,Abelmoschus esculentus,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Malvaceae,Abelmoschus,Abelmoschus esculentus,ACCEPTED,Abelmoschus esculentus,NA,NA,species,NA,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,seeds; seed; leaves; fruits; fruit,5,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,United States,0.999992405375856,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_026

9652,EFFECT OF SEED TREATMENT AND FERTILIZER COATED WITH FLUTRIAFOL ON BLACKLEG OF CANOLA (OILSEED RAPE) IN WESTERN CANADA,"The systemic fungicide flutriafol coated on fertilizers at various dosages and applied as a seed treatment was evaluated against blackleg disease [Leptosphaeria maculans] of spring canola (Brassica napus and B. rapa) in extensive field trials in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Marginal and variable control of the disease was obtained. Analyses with gas chromatography for flutriafol residues in plant materials from field trials indicated that the fungicide was taken up and was present in canola plants throughout the growing season. The highest quantities were detected in plants from a coated mono-calcium phosphate treatment. Isolations made from samples of plant material collected in field trials showed that the fungicide treatments had limited effects on infection early in the season. There is no definite answer as to why blackleg has been successfully controlled with flutriafol-coated fertilizer in Australia, but not in western Canada. Soil types and pH in the optimum range for agricultural practice did not have major effects on the efficacy of the treatments. The interaction of the pathogen and the host in relation to fungicide uptake under particular environmental conditions may play a key role in affecting the disease.","XI, K; KUTCHER, HR; WESTCOTT, ND; MORRALL, RAA; RIMMER, SR",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PHYTOPATHOLOGIE,1991,10.1080/07060669109500919,0.89227820048458,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98996291865814,0.0100370813418603,0.999953990192776,4.60098072240234e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,leptosphaeria maculans,leptosphaeria maculans,8508382,Leptosphaeria maculans,Fungi,Ascomycota,Leptosphaeriaceae,Leptosphaeria,Leptosphaeria maculans,ACCEPTED,Leptosphaeria maculans,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,seed,1,Canada; Australia,Canada; Australia,NA,australia,NA,FALSE,Canada; Australia; australia,0.999953990192776,High (≥0.9),4,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_028
11738,Differences in fungal communities associated to Festuca paniculata roots in subalpine grasslands,"Mycorrhizal fungi or endphytes colonize plant roots and their occurrence and composition depend on biotic and abiotic characteristics of the ecosystem. We investigated the composition of these microbial communities associated with Festuca paniculata, a slow growing species, which dramatically impacts functional plant diversity and the recycling of organic matter in subalpine grasslands. F. paniculata individuals from both mown and unmown grasslands were randomly collected and the microscopic observation of the plant roots revealed a difference in fungal colonization according to management. The ITS regions of root-associated fungi were amplified, cloned and sequenced. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a total of 43 and 35 phylotypes in mown and unmown grasslands respectively, highlighting a remarkable difference in the composition between both fungal communities. The phylotypes were assigned to 9 classes in which two classes Eurotiomycetes and Lecanoromycetes were specific to mown grasslands, while Tremellomycetes were specific to unmown grasslands and only five phylotypes were common to both locations. The comparative analysis of fungal lifestyles indicated the dominance of saprobes and a large proportion of endophytes compared to the mycorrhizal fungi (7/1 and 11/2 phylotypes in mown and unmown grasslands, respectively). Endophyte richness was greater in the unmown gassland than in the mown grassland and their relative proportion was twice higher. Our results suggest that endophytes may offer potential resources to F. paniculata and play an important role in the regulation of plant diversity.","Mouhamadou, B; Molitor, C; Baptist, F; Sage, L; Clément, JC; Lavorel, S; Monier, A; Geremia, RA",FUNGAL DIVERSITY,2011,10.1007/s13225-011-0091-3,0.95902169491842,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99127040723545,0.00872959276454972,0.999924481252004,7.55187479963837e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,festuca paniculata,festuca paniculata,NA,NA,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Poaceae,Patzkea,Patzkea paniculata,SYNONYM,Patzkea paniculata,Festuca paniculata,Patzkea paniculata,species,NA,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,molecular; microscopy,mycorrhizal; roots; root,3,South Africa,NA,South Africa,NA,subalpine; grassland,FALSE,South Africa; subalpine; grassland,0.999924481252004,High (≥0.9),3,High (3-4 types),No species,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | No species,,,,,,,VAL_029
15808,The diversity of endophytic and epiphytic fungi of the litter in differently agedCasuarina equisetifolia forests in Hainan Island; [海南岛 不 同 林 龄 短 枝 木 麻 黄 凋 落 物 内 外 真 菌 多 样 性分析],"Casuarina equisetifolia forests are widely spread in tropical to subtropical coast, serving as windbreak forests.However, C. equisetifolia forests have poor natural regeneration rate, which were considered involving the allelopathy of thelitter. The aim of the study was to investigate the characteristics of endophytic and epiphytic fungal communities of the litterin C. equisetifolia forests (young?aged forest, middle?aged forest and mature?aged forest) at Guilinyang coast of Haikou,Hainan province, China. The ITS rDNA was sequenced by Illumina high?throughput sequencing technology, which was usedto analyze the diversity of the microbial communities of the litter from different aged forests. The litter and soilphysicochemical properties were measured to determine the correlations between them. A total of 669,476 valid sequenceswere obtained for all samples and contained 6 phyla, 23 classes, 59 orders, 119 families, 212 genus, and 314 species. Thediversity and abundance of the epiphytic fungal communities of the C. equisetifolia litter was higher than those of theendophytic fungi. There were greater similarity among the endophytic and epiphytic fungal community compositions. It wasfound that Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the main fungi of the litter. There were three dominant orders exist in bothendophytic and epiphytic fungal communities, including Capnodiales, Xylariales and Auriculariales. Coniochaetales,Magnaporthales and another two orders were specially distributed in the litter, while Basidiobolales and Trichosporonaleswere endemic to epiphytic fungi. The pH and organic carbon of the litter were significantly correlated to endophytic fungalcommunity structure, while the bulk density and ammonium nitrogen of the soil were significantly correlated to epiphyticfungal community structure. This work provided an important theoretical basis for studying the role of microorganisms in thedecomposition of C. equisetifolia litter. © 2020 Science Press.

17642,First Report of Root and Basal Stem Rot Caused by Phytophthora nicotianae on Tree Aeonium (Aeonium arboreum) in Italy.,"The genus Aeonium, family Crassulaceae, comprises approximately 35 species that are native to northern Africa and the Canary Islands. Tree aeonium (Aeonium arboreum (L.) Webb & Berthel.) is a bushy, perennial succulent with rosettes of tender, waxy leaves at the apex of few-branched or occasionally single, naked stems. Mature rosettes bear yellowish inflorescences. Aeoniums are cultivated as ornamentals in gardens and containers. During the summer of 2009, in a garden in eastern Sicily (southern Italy), 3-year-old potted plants of tree aeonium showed stunting, shrivelling, and chlorosis of leaves and drop of external leaves associated with root and basal stem rot. Drops of an amber exudate oozed from the basal stem. Tissues of the basal stem were soft, but no external necrosis was visible. A species of Phytophthora was consistently isolated from symptomatic roots and basal stem tissues on a medium selective for Oomycetes (2). Axenic cultures were obtained by single-hypha transfers. The pathogen was identified by morphological criteria as Phytophthora nicotianae B. de Haan; it formed stoloniferous colonies on potato dextrose agar and grew between 8 and 38°C, with the optimum at 30°C. On V8 juice agar it produced spherical, intercalary chlamydospores (mean diameter of 26 μm) and persistent, mono- and bipapillate, spherical to ovoid, ellipsoid, obpyriform sporangia that measured 29 to 56 × 22 to 45 μm with a mean length/breadth ratio of 1.3:1. All isolates were A2 mating type and formed spherical oogonia (mean diameter 28 ± 2 μm) with smooth walls and amphigynous antheridia in dual cultures with a reference isolate of the A1 mating type of P. nicotianae. BLAST analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA of a representative isolate from aeonium (IMI 398812, GenBank Accession No. HQ433333) amplified by PCR using the ITS6/ITS4 universal primers (1), revealed 99% similarity with the sequences of a reference isolate of P. nicotianae available in GenBank (Accession No. EU331089.1). Pathogenicity of isolate IMI 398812 was demonstrated by transplanting cuttings of A. arboreum into pots filled with a mixture of steam-sterilized sandy loam soil and inoculum (4% vol/vol) produced by growing the isolate for 20 days on wheat kernels. Ten plants were transplanted into 3-liter pots (two plants per pot) while 10 plants, transplanted into pots filled with a mixture of steam-sterilized soil and noninoculated kernels, were used as controls. Plants were kept in a greenhouse at 25 to 28°C and watered daily to field capacity. Thirty to forty days after the transplanting into infested soil, cuttings developed the same symptoms observed on plants with natural infections. Control plants remained symptomless. P. nicotianae was reisolated from symptomatic plants, thereby completing Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. nicotianae on an Aeonium species worldwide. The economic relevance of this disease is minor because aeoniums are not cultivated on a large scale. Moreover, the disease may be easily prevented by avoiding excess irrigation water since aeoniums need a well-drained soil or potting mix and do not tolerate soil waterlogging. References: (1) D. E.

6059,Phytochemical Screening and Biological Activities of Fungal Phyllosticta capitalensis Derived from Andrographis paniculata,"The research aims to evaluate the phytochemical constituents and biological activity (antibacterial and antioxidant activity) of the extract of endophytic fungi isolated from the seeds of Andrographis paniculata. Isolation of endophytic fungus followed the dilution method with Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) media. Three single strains of fungi have been isolated from seeds of A. panicalata. They were cultivated on the white, black, and red rice media for three weeks, respectively. Extraction of the cultivated fungi with ethyl acetate followed by evaporation yielded the crude extract. The antibacterial and antioxidant activity were evaluated for nine crude extracts of fungi. Data of their biological activities showed that the ethyl acetate extract from fungus SAP-1 on the black rice media was the rich of active compounds. Molecular identification showing the fungus SAP-1 was Phyllosticta capitalensis. Further research of isolation and structure elucidation of bioactive compounds from fungal P. capitalensis obtained from the seeds of A. paniculata will be performed in the future. Interestingly, phytochemical and biological study of extract of endophytic fungus P. capitalensis from the seeds of A. paniculata is firstly reported in this study.","Suryelita, S; Riga, R; Etika, SB; Ikhsan, MH; Febria, F; Yolanda, M; Ulfah, M; Artasasta, MA",MOROCCAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY,2023,10.48317/IMIST.PRSM/morjchem-v11i2.33657,0.568312555508086,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994290287937202,0.00570971206279817,0.999508814324469,4.911856755313e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,andrographis paniculata,andrographis paniculata,3173178,Andrographis paniculata,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Acanthaceae,Andrographis,Andrographis paniculata,ACCEPTED,Andrographis paniculata,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,seeds,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,0.999508814324469,High (≥0.9),3,High (3-4 types),Species detected,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | Species detected,,,,,,,VAL_033
21014,Culturing sputum for systemic fungi,"In most cases, sputum is the specimen of choice for culturing fungi responsible for systemic infection. Culturing sputum requires careful collection of specimen-including education of patients as to precisely what sputum is. In addition, because sputum is not homogeneous and contains contaminants, processing is required prior to planting on media. (Media selection and control of incubation conditions are also very important.) This paper describes the steps-from initial collection through identification of organisms-required to successfully culture sputum for fungi.",Bauman D.S.,Journal of Medical Technology,1984,NA,0.823668805802572,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Absence,0.184966559646739,0.815033440353261,0.999471032149062,5.2896785093814e-4,Absence,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Presence,Absence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NO_MATCH,NA,NA,NA,none,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,0.999471032149062,High (≥0.9),1,Low (1 type),No species,Presence,Presence | High (≥0.9) | No species,,,,,,,VAL_034
15337,Secondary metabolites of endophyte fungi Xylaria sp. from Coptis chinensis; [黄连内生真菌炭角菌次生代谢产物研究],"Two new polyketides, lasobutone A (1) and lasobutone B (2), along with three known compounds, guignardianone C (3), guignardic acid (4), and 4-hydroxy-17R-methylincisterol (5), were isolated from the endophytic fungi Xylaria sp. by silica gel, MCI, and preparative HPLC, which was separated from the Chinese medicinal material Coptis chinensis and cultivated through solid fermentation with rice. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic methods, such as MS, NMR, IR, UV, and ECD. Compounds 2 and 4 showed inhibitory activities against the nitric oxide (NO) production in the LPS-induced macrophage RAW264.7 with IC50 values of 58.7 and 42.5 μmol•L-1 respectively, while compound 5 exhibited cytotoxic activities against HT-29 with IC50 value of 14.3 μmol•L-1. © 2022, Editorial Board of China Journal of Chinese Materia Medica.
