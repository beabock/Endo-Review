1362,Differences in endophyte communities of introduced trees depend on the phylogenetic relatedness of the receiving forest,"Plant species sometimes perform extraordinarily well when introduced to new environments, through achieving higher growth rates, individual biomasses or higher densities in their receiving communities compared to their native range communities. One hypothesis proposed to explain enhanced performance in species' new environments is that their soil microbial communities may be different and provide greater benefit than microbial communities encountered in species' native environments. However, detailed descriptions of soil biota associated with species in both their native and introduced environments remain scarce. We established a global network of sites in regions where the tree species Pinus contorta has been introduced (Chile, New Zealand, Finland, Scotland and Sweden), as well as native range sites where the introduced populations originated (Canada and USA). We conducted pyrosequencing analysis to compare the root fungal endophyte communities associated with P.contorta in its native environments and in introduced environments with phylogenetically similar and dissimilar tree species (i.e. P.sylvestris in Europe and Nothofagus spp. in the Southern Hemisphere). Fungal communities associated with P.contorta consistently differed between its introduced and native environments. In Europe, P.contorta associated with the same community as P.sylvestris, where one particular species (Piloderma sphaerosporum) was particularly abundant relative to Canadian sites. In the Southern Hemisphere, P.contorta fungal communities were composed primarily of North American taxa and exhibited very little overlap with fungal communities associated with native Nothofagus spp.Synthesis. Our work shows that plants exhibit considerable plasticity in their interaction with fungi, by associating with different fungal communities across native and introduced environments. Our work also indicates that fungal communities associated with introduced plants can assemble through different mechanisms, that is by associating with existing fungal communities of phylogenetically close species, or through reassembly of co-introduced and co-invading fungi. The identification of different fungal communities in a plant species new environment provides an important step forward in understanding how soil biota may impact growth and invasion when a species is introduced to new environments.","Gundale, MJ; Almeida, JP; Wallander, H; Wardle, DA; Kardol, P; Nilsson, MC; Fajardo, A; Pauchard, A; Peltzer, DA; Ruotsalainen, S; Mason, B; Rosenstock, N",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2016,10.1111/1365-2745.12595,0.878560205553843,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999972993667548,2.70063324516871e-5,0.999999988919986,1.1080014017395e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,pinus contorta,pinus contorta,5285750,Pinus contorta,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Pinaceae,Pinus,Pinus contorta,ACCEPTED,Pinus contorta,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,root,1,USA; Canada; Scotland; Sweden; Finland; New Zealand; Chile,USA; Canada; Scotland; Sweden; Finland; New Zealand,Chile,europe,NA,FALSE,USA; Canada; Scotland; Sweden; Finland; New Zealand; Chile; europe; europe

The identification of different fungal communities in a plant species new environment provides an important step forward in understanding how soil biota may impact growth and invasion when a species is introduced to new environments.","Gundale, MJ; Almeida, JP; Wallander, H; Wardle, DA; Kardol, P; Nilsson, MC; Fajardo, A; Pauchard, A; Peltzer, DA; Ruotsalainen, S; Mason, B; Rosenstock, N",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2016,10.1111/1365-2745.12595,0.878560205553843,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999972993667548,2.70063324516871e-5,0.999999988919986,1.1080014017395e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,Pinus,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Pinaceae,NA,Pinus,ACCEPTED,Pinus,NA,NA,genus,pinus,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,root,1,USA; Canada; Scotland; Sweden; Finland; New Zealand; Chile,USA; Canada; Scotland; Sweden; Finland; New Zealand,Chile,europe,NA,FALSE,USA; Canada; Scotland; Sweden; Finland; New Zealand; Chile; europe; europe

15681,Secondary metabolites of endophytic fungi from newbouldia laevis and cassia tora leaves: Prospecting for new antimicrobial agents,"Aim: This study tries to find new antimicrobial agents using some Nigerian plants. Background: Antimicrobial compounds from fungi endophytes have shown great promise in mitigating the threats of resistant pathogens. Objective: The study evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial property of secondary metabolites of endophytic fungi isolated from Newbouldia laevis and Cassia tora leaves. Methods: Ten endophytic fungi were isolated from the two plants’ leaves and later fermented on local rice for 21 days. Thereafter, their secondary metabolites were extracted using ethyl acetate. The antibacterial activity of the extracts on the test organisms were determined using agar diffusion and agar dilution methods, while the bioactive constituents were identified using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detector. Results: Nine of the crude extracts (NL1, NL3, NL6, NL10, NL12, CT2, CT7, CT9 and CT10) of the fungi isolates inhibited at least one of the microorganisms studied with maximum and minimum inhibition-zone-diameter of 14 mm and 2 mm, respectively while CT1 did not inhibit any of the tested microorganisms at tested concentrations. The extracts exhibited good antifungal activity, inhibiting the growth of both C. albicans and Trichophyton tested with an inhibition-zone-diameter ranging between 4-8 mm and 7-14 mm, respectively. The endophytic fungi extracts-CT2 and NL1-exhibited the best antimicrobial activity, inhibiting most of the tested microorganisms. HPLC-DAD analysis of the endophytic fungal extracts identified some classes of compounds such as catechin derivatives, benzoic acid derivatives and apigenin, which were previously reported to have antimicrobial potentials. Conclusion: Newbouldia laevis and Cassia tora leaves house endophytic fungi capable of yielding secondary metabolites with potential as anti-infective agents. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.",Amaechi A.A.; Oli A.N.; Okezie U.M.; Adejumo S.A.; Abba C.C.; Okeke I.J.; Okoye F.B.C.,Recent Advances in Anti-Infective Drug Discovery,2021,10.2174/1574891X15999201222152646,0.941921950729321,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99866412637451,0.00133587362548998,0.99999986498402,1.35015980284869e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,newbouldia laevis,newbouldia laevis,4091370,Newbouldia laevis,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Bignoniaceae,Newbouldia,Newbouldia laevis,ACCEPTED,Newbouldia laevis,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,leaves,1,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States

Methods: Ten endophytic fungi were isolated from the two plants’ leaves and later fermented on local rice for 21 days. Thereafter, their secondary metabolites were extracted using ethyl acetate. The antibacterial activity of the extracts on the test organisms were determined using agar diffusion and agar dilution methods, while the bioactive constituents were identified using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detector. Results: Nine of the crude extracts (NL1, NL3, NL6, NL10, NL12, CT2, CT7, CT9 and CT10) of the fungi isolates inhibited at least one of the microorganisms studied with maximum and minimum inhibition-zone-diameter of 14 mm and 2 mm, respectively while CT1 did not inhibit any of the tested microorganisms at tested concentrations. The extracts exhibited good antifungal activity, inhibiting the growth of both C. albicans and Trichophyton tested with an inhibition-zone-diameter ranging between 4-8 mm and 7-14 mm, respectively. The endophytic fungi extracts-CT2 and NL1-exhibited the best antimicrobial activity, inhibiting most of the tested microorganisms. HPLC-DAD analysis of the endophytic fungal extracts identified some classes of compounds such as catechin derivatives, benzoic acid derivatives and apigenin, which were previously reported to have antimicrobial potentials. Conclusion: Newbouldia laevis and Cassia tora leaves house endophytic fungi capable of yielding secondary metabolites with potential as anti-infective agents. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.",Amaechi A.A.; Oli A.N.; Okezie U.M.; Adejumo S.A.; Abba C.C.; Okeke I.J.; Okoye F.B.C.,Recent Advances in Anti-Infective Drug Discovery,2021,10.2174/1574891X15999201222152646,0.941921950729321,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99866412637451,0.00133587362548998,0.99999986498402,1.35015980284869e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,cassia tora,cassia tora,NA,NA,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Fabaceae,Senna,Senna tora,SYNONYM,Senna tora,Cassia tora,Senna tora,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,leaves,1,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States

Through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, phytochelatins are identified to be involved in the biosynthesis of nanoparticles.","Vijayanandan, AS; Balakrishnan, RM",APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING,2020,10.1007/s00339-020-3395-x,0.980228170930029,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.975559498568892,0.0244405014311075,0.999999582642978,4.17357022275411e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,Aspergillus,Fungi,Ascomycota,Trichocomaceae,NA,Aspergillus,ACCEPTED,Aspergillus,NA,NA,genus,aspergillus,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,NA,0,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,United States
1743,Predicting interactions of the frass-associated yeast Hyphopichia heimii with Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata and twig-boring bark beetles,"Bark beetles are destructive insect pests known to form symbioses with different fungal taxa, including yeasts. The aim of this study was to (1) determine the prevalence of the rare yeast Hyphopichia heimii in bark beetle frass from wild olive trees in South Africa and to (2) predict the potential interaction of this yeast with trees and bark beetles. Twenty-eight culturable yeast species were isolated from frass in 35 bark beetle galleries, including representatives of H. heimii from nine samples. Physiological characterization of H. heimii isolates revealed that none was able to degrade complex polymers present in hemicellulose; however, all were able to assimilate sucrose and cellobiose, sugars associated with an arboreal habitat. All isolates were able to produce the auxin indole acetic acid, indicative of a potential symbiosis with the tree. Sterol analysis revealed that the isolates possessed ergosterol quantities ranging from 3.644 +/- 0.119 to 13.920 +/- 1.230 mg/g dry cell weight, which suggested that H. heimii could serve as a source of sterols in bark beetle diets, as is known for other bark beetle-associated fungi. In addition, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated that at least one of the isolates, Hyphopichia heimii CAB 1614, was able to convert the insect pheromone cis-verbenol to the anti-aggregation pheromone verbenone. This indicated that H. heimii could potentially influence beetle behaviour. These results support the contention of a tripartite symbiosis between H. heimii, olive trees, and bark beetles.","Asmus, JJ; Toplis, B; Roets, F; Botha, A",FOLIA MICROBIOLOGICA,2022,10.1007/s12223-022-00985-2,0.97307616090315,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985755730389218,0.0142442696107817,0.999999481032678,5.18967321561092e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,hyphopichia heimii,hyphopichia heimii,3305171,Hyphopichia heimii,Fungi,Ascomycota,Debaryomycetaceae,Hyphopichia,Hyphopichia heimii,ACCEPTED,Hyphopichia heimii,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,bark,1,South Africa,NA,South Africa,africa,NA,FALSE,South Africa; africa

11781,Postglacial colonization history reflects in the genetic structure of natural populations of Festuca rubra in Europe,"We conducted a large-scale population genetic survey of genetic diversity of the host grass Festuca rubra s.l., which fitness can be highly dependent on its symbiotic fungus Epichloe festucae, to evaluate genetic variation and population structure across the European range. The 27 studied populations have previously been found to differ in frequencies of occurrence of the symbiotic fungus E. festucae and ploidy levels. As predicted, we found decreased genetic diversity in previously glaciated areas in comparison with nonglaciated regions and discovered three major maternal genetic groups: southern, northeastern, and northwestern Europe. Interestingly, host populations from Greenland were genetically similar to those from the Faroe Islands and Iceland, suggesting gene flow also between those areas. The level of variation among populations within regions is evidently highly dependent on the postglacial colonization history, in particular on the number of independent long-distance seed colonization events. Yet, also anthropogenic effects may have affected the population structure in F. rubra. We did not observe higher fungal infection rates in grass populations with lower levels of genetic variability. In fact, the fungal infection rates of E. festucae in relation to genetic variability of the host populations varied widely among geographical areas, which indicate differences in population histories due to colonization events and possible costs of systemic fungi in harsh environmental conditions. We found that the plants of different ploidy levels are genetically closely related within geographic areas indicating independent formation of polyploids in different maternal lineages.","von Cräutlein, M; Leinonen, PH; Korpelainen, H; Helander, M; Väre, H; Saikkonen, K",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2019,10.1002/ece3.4997,0.977432646469154,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995982867095872,0.00401713290412762,0.999993710305799,6.28969420068959e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,festuca rubra,festuca rubra,2704922,Festuca rubra,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Poaceae,Festuca,Festuca rubra,ACCEPTED,Festuca rubra,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,scale; seed,2,Iceland,Iceland,NA,europe,NA,FALSE,Iceland; europe

We found that the plants of different ploidy levels are genetically closely related within geographic areas indicating independent formation of polyploids in different maternal lineages.","von Cräutlein, M; Leinonen, PH; Korpelainen, H; Helander, M; Väre, H; Saikkonen, K",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2019,10.1002/ece3.4997,0.977432646469154,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995982867095872,0.00401713290412762,0.999993710305799,6.28969420068959e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,Epichloe,Fungi,Ascomycota,Clavicipitaceae,NA,Epichloe,ACCEPTED,Epichloe,NA,NA,genus,epichloe,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,scale; seed,2,Iceland,Iceland,NA,europe,NA,FALSE,Iceland; europe
9312,Functional roles of fungal endophytes in host fitness during stress conditions,"Fungal endophytes live symbiotically within healthy plant tissues and found to be associated with all host plants studied till date in all natural ecosystems with varied geographical areas. These microbes benefit the plants by conferring resistance to several biotic and abiotic stresses and also influence the soil rhizosphere environment. The endophytic fungi may affect plant phenotypic and functional traits by promoting nutrient/mineral uptake and alters defensive pathways. The importance of fungal endophytes to ecosystem functioning via soil processes is also aroused increasing interest during the past decade as host-fungal interaction affects ecology, distribution, and diversity of plants. The present review ascertains the role of fungal endophytes on host ecological fitness during different stress conditions.","Naik, BS",SYMBIOSIS,2019,10.1007/s13199-019-00635-1,0.972289232243757,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997472959292733,0.00252704070726745,0.999999999996791,3.20898863037655e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NO_MATCH,NA,NA,NA,none,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA

Their structures were mainly determined by extensive spectroscopic analysis. The relative configurations of bipolacochlioquinones A-C were assigned using the ROESY spectrum, comparison of their spectral data with that reported in the literatures, and NMR calculations. Moreover, their complete absolute configurations were further established by electronic circular dichroism calculations using density functional theory. Among them, bipolacochlioquinone A is found to represent the first example of previously undescribed 6/6/6/6/6 pentacyclic dioxane-containing cochlioquinones, and bipolacochlioquinone B possesses a rare 6/6/6/6/5 pentacyclic system bearing a tetrahydrofuran ring fused to a polyketide and a sesquiterpenoid subunit. All compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on tumor growth, metastasis, and the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Among them, bipolacochlioquinone C and cochlioquinone A show the most potent cytotoxicities and NF-kappa B inhibitory activities. The effects of bipolacochlioquinone C and cochlioquinone A on the expression of NF-kappa B-associated proteins were also evaluated using western blotting.

1546,Spatial responses of two herbivore groups to a geometrid larva on mountain birch,"Direct or plant-mediated interactions between herbivores may modify their spatial distribution among and within plants. In this study, we examined the effect of a leaf-chewing geometrid, the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata), on two different herbivore groups, leaf rolling Deporaus betulae weevils and Eriocrania spp. leafminers, both feeding on mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii). The exact locations of herbivores within tree canopies were mapped during three successive summers. In the first 2 years, some trees were artificially colonized by eggs of the autumnal moth to induce both rapid and delayed resistance in the foliage. The natural infection levels of the pathogenic rust fungus (Melampsoridium betulinum), potentially involved in species interactions, were also recorded. At the level of the whole tree, the density of D. betulae leaf rolls was lower in trees infested by the autumnal moth in the same year. However, the feeding locations within trees were partly segregated: D. betulae favoured shadier branches, while E. autumnata preferred the sunny parts of the canopy. The autumnal moth did not affect current- or following-year density of leafminers at the tree or branch level. Trees infected by rust had fewer leafminers in the same summer than noninfected trees. There were no interaction effects between defoliation by the autumnal moth and rust infection, and no delayed effects on the abundance of other herbivores the following year. Taken together, these findings suggest that the autumnal moth has a negative, partially plant-mediated impact on D. betulae, and can reduce the extent of current-year defoliation caused by D. betulae. This may be beneficial for the mountain birch, since the greater part of D. betulae damage occurs around or after the end of the larval period of the autumnal moth, which may be a critical time for tree recovery after moth outbreaks.","Riihimäki, J; Kaitaniemi, P; Ruohomäki, K",OECOLOGIA,2003,10.1007/s00442-002-1082-6,0.699451620787856,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.96390239259463,0.03609760740537,0.99999999994138,5.861955365560329e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,betula pubescens,betula pubescens,9118014,Betula pubescens,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Betulaceae,Betula,Betula pubescens,ACCEPTED,Betula pubescens,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,leaf; foliage; branches; canopy; branch,5,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States

In this study, we examined the effect of a leaf-chewing geometrid, the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata), on two different herbivore groups, leaf rolling Deporaus betulae weevils and Eriocrania spp. leafminers, both feeding on mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii). The exact locations of herbivores within tree canopies were mapped during three successive summers. In the first 2 years, some trees were artificially colonized by eggs of the autumnal moth to induce both rapid and delayed resistance in the foliage. The natural infection levels of the pathogenic rust fungus (Melampsoridium betulinum), potentially involved in species interactions, were also recorded. At the level of the whole tree, the density of D. betulae leaf rolls was lower in trees infested by the autumnal moth in the same year. However, the feeding locations within trees were partly segregated: D. betulae favoured shadier branches, while E. autumnata preferred the sunny parts of the canopy. The autumnal moth did not affect current- or following-year density of leafminers at the tree or branch level. Trees infected by rust had fewer leafminers in the same summer than noninfected trees.

10929,STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE GAMETOPHYTE OF PSILOTUM-NUDUM,"The gametophytes used in this study amounted to about 600 and belonged to a race of Psilotum nodum growing in the greenhouses of the Bot. Dept., U. Minn. The race was probably introduced with other plants from the Gulf-Caribbean area during the 1920''s. The descr. of the vegetative features is in accordance with published accounts dealing with the previous collections of gametophytes. It was concluded that the endophytic fungus is non-specific, i.e., may be one of several spp. There is present in the apex of the gametophyte a pyramidal spical cell with 3 cutting faces. This condition is often obscured by differential enlargement and accompanying changes in shape of adjacent cells when the division of the apical cell are infrequent. The naked apices experience various degrees of injury under natural conditions within a coarse substratum. New apical cells differentiate following apical injuries, and this results in the formation of various types of ramification. The discontinuous vascular strand is primarily referable to shifts in the bulk of the apical meristem as influenced by apical injury and subsequent repairatory activity. All of the gametophytes are assumed to be potential producers of vascular strands. The branching patterns are primarily environmentally controlled. They are genetically controlled only in that the gametophytes have the inherent ability to differentiate apical cells, and subsequently new apices, following a disturbance of the apical meristem. The unqualified use of the expression ""dichotomous branching pattern"" should be avoided.","BIERHORST, DW",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,1953,10.2307/2439676,0.9897455959453,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.865375571754202,0.134624428245798,0.999999892730074,1.07269925719855e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,Psilotum,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Psilotaceae,NA,Psilotum,ACCEPTED,Psilotum,NA,NA,genus,psilotum,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,apical meristem,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,caribbean,FALSE,caribbean
16808,First Report of Crown Rot and Stem Rot Caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG-4 on Marmalade Bush in Italy.,"Marmalade bush (Streptosolen jamesonii (Benth.) Miers), also known as fire bush, is an evergreen, perennial shrub in the family Solanaceae, which is native to South America (Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru). In Italy, this species is cultivated as an ornamental creeper or bush. During September 2009, a new disease was observed in a stock of ~10,000 pot-grown, 2-month-old plants of marmalade bush in a nursery in eastern Sicily, Italy. More than 50% of the plants exhibited symptoms of disease. Disease symptoms consisted of extensive water-soaked, dark brown lesions at the crown level that girdled entire stems and an internal brown discoloration of cortical tissue. Infected plants died within a few days. Diseased tissue was disinfested for 10 s in 1% NaOCl, rinsed with sterile water, and plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with streptomycin sulfate at 100 mg/liter. Fungal colonies were initially white, turned brown after 2 to 3 days, and produced irregularly shaped, brown sclerotia. Microscopic examination showed mycelium consistent with Rhizoctonia solani Kühn that branched at right angles, constricted at the base of the branch originating from primary hyphae, and septate near the constriction. The number of nuclei per hyphal cell was determined on cultures grown at 25°C on 2% water agar in petri plates by staining with 1% safranin O and 3% KOH solution (1) and examined at ×400. The hyphal cells were all multinucleate. Anastomosis group was determined by pairing isolates on 2% water agar in petri plates (2). Pairings were made with tester strains AG-1 IA, AG-2-2-1, AG-2-2IIIB, AG-2-2IV, AG-3, AG-4, AG-5, AG-6, and AG-11. Anastomosis was observed only with tester isolates of AG-4. Pathogenicity tests were performed by placing 1-cm2 plugs of PDA from 5-day-old mycelial cultures near the base of the stem on 25 potted, healthy, 2-month-old rooted cuttings of marmalade bush. The same number of plants treated with 1-cm2 PDA plugs served as controls. Following inoculation, all plants were maintained for 20 days at 25°C and 95% relative humidity under a 12-h fluorescent light/dark regimen. Crown and stem symptoms, identical to those observed in the nursery, developed 5 days after inoculation on all inoculated plants. Control plants remained symptomless.

16808,First Report of Crown Rot and Stem Rot Caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG-4 on Marmalade Bush in Italy.,"Marmalade bush (Streptosolen jamesonii (Benth.) Miers), also known as fire bush, is an evergreen, perennial shrub in the family Solanaceae, which is native to South America (Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru). In Italy, this species is cultivated as an ornamental creeper or bush. During September 2009, a new disease was observed in a stock of ~10,000 pot-grown, 2-month-old plants of marmalade bush in a nursery in eastern Sicily, Italy. More than 50% of the plants exhibited symptoms of disease. Disease symptoms consisted of extensive water-soaked, dark brown lesions at the crown level that girdled entire stems and an internal brown discoloration of cortical tissue. Infected plants died within a few days. Diseased tissue was disinfested for 10 s in 1% NaOCl, rinsed with sterile water, and plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with streptomycin sulfate at 100 mg/liter. Fungal colonies were initially white, turned brown after 2 to 3 days, and produced irregularly shaped, brown sclerotia. Microscopic examination showed mycelium consistent with Rhizoctonia solani Kühn that branched at right angles, constricted at the base of the branch originating from primary hyphae, and septate near the constriction. The number of nuclei per hyphal cell was determined on cultures grown at 25°C on 2% water agar in petri plates by staining with 1% safranin O and 3% KOH solution (1) and examined at ×400. The hyphal cells were all multinucleate. Anastomosis group was determined by pairing isolates on 2% water agar in petri plates (2). Pairings were made with tester strains AG-1 IA, AG-2-2-1, AG-2-2IIIB, AG-2-2IV, AG-3, AG-4, AG-5, AG-6, and AG-11. Anastomosis was observed only with tester isolates of AG-4. Pathogenicity tests were performed by placing 1-cm2 plugs of PDA from 5-day-old mycelial cultures near the base of the stem on 25 potted, healthy, 2-month-old rooted cuttings of marmalade bush. The same number of plants treated with 1-cm2 PDA plugs served as controls. Following inoculation, all plants were maintained for 20 days at 25°C and 95% relative humidity under a 12-h fluorescent light/dark regimen. Crown and stem symptoms, identical to those observed in the nursery, developed 5 days after inoculation on all inoculated plants. Control plants remained symptomless. R. solani was consistently reisolated from symptomatic tissues and identified as previously described. To our knowledge, this is the first report of R. solani causing disease on marmalade bush.

15808,The diversity of endophytic and epiphytic fungi of the litter in differently agedCasuarina equisetifolia forests in Hainan Island; [海南岛 不 同 林 龄 短 枝 木 麻 黄 凋 落 物 内 外 真 菌 多 样 性分析],"Casuarina equisetifolia forests are widely spread in tropical to subtropical coast, serving as windbreak forests.However, C. equisetifolia forests have poor natural regeneration rate, which were considered involving the allelopathy of thelitter. The aim of the study was to investigate the characteristics of endophytic and epiphytic fungal communities of the litterin C. equisetifolia forests (young?aged forest, middle?aged forest and mature?aged forest) at Guilinyang coast of Haikou,Hainan province, China. The ITS rDNA was sequenced by Illumina high?throughput sequencing technology, which was usedto analyze the diversity of the microbial communities of the litter from different aged forests. The litter and soilphysicochemical properties were measured to determine the correlations between them. A total of 669,476 valid sequenceswere obtained for all samples and contained 6 phyla, 23 classes, 59 orders, 119 families, 212 genus, and 314 species. Thediversity and abundance of the epiphytic fungal communities of the C. equisetifolia litter was higher than those of theendophytic fungi. There were greater similarity among the endophytic and epiphytic fungal community compositions. It wasfound that Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the main fungi of the litter. There were three dominant orders exist in bothendophytic and epiphytic fungal communities, including Capnodiales, Xylariales and Auriculariales. Coniochaetales,Magnaporthales and another two orders were specially distributed in the litter, while Basidiobolales and Trichosporonaleswere endemic to epiphytic fungi.

2109,The Fungal Endophyte Penicillium olsonii ML37 Reduces Fusarium Head Blight by Local Induced Resistance in Wheat Spikes,"The fungal endophyte Penicillium olsonii ML37 is a biocontrol agent of Fusarium head blight in wheat (caused by Fusarium graminearum), which has shown a limited direct inhibition of fungal growth in vitro. We used RNA-seq and LC-MS/MS analyses to elucidate metabolic interactions of the three-way system Penicillium-wheat-Fusarium in greenhouse experiments. We demonstrated that P. olsonii ML37 colonises wheat spikes and transiently activates plant defence mechanisms, as pretreated spikes show a faster and stronger expression of the defence metabolism during the first 24 h after pathogen inoculation. This effect was transient and the expression of the same genes was lower in the pathogen-infected spikes than in those infected by P. olsonii alone. This response to the endophyte includes the transcriptional activation of several WRKY transcription factors. This early activation is associated with a reduction in FHB symptoms and significantly lower levels of the F. graminearum metabolites 15-acetyl-DON and culmorin. An increase in the Penicillium-associated metabolite asperphanamate confirms colonisation by the endophyte. Our results suggest that the mode of action used by P. olsonii ML37 is via a local defence activation in wheat spikes, and that this fungus has potential as a novel biological alternative in wheat disease control.","Rojas, EC; Jensen, B; Jorgensen, HJL; Latz, MAC; Esteban, P; Collinge, DB",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2022,10.3390/jof8040345,0.975640786298933,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992890454812459,0.00710954518754148,0.999961255535023,3.87444649770918e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,penicillium olsonii,penicillium olsonii,2597773,Penicillium olsonii,Fungi,Ascomycota,Aspergillaceae,Penicillium,Penicillium olsonii,ACCEPTED,Penicillium olsonii,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,spikes,1,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States

2109,The Fungal Endophyte Penicillium olsonii ML37 Reduces Fusarium Head Blight by Local Induced Resistance in Wheat Spikes,"The fungal endophyte Penicillium olsonii ML37 is a biocontrol agent of Fusarium head blight in wheat (caused by Fusarium graminearum), which has shown a limited direct inhibition of fungal growth in vitro. We used RNA-seq and LC-MS/MS analyses to elucidate metabolic interactions of the three-way system Penicillium-wheat-Fusarium in greenhouse experiments. We demonstrated that P. olsonii ML37 colonises wheat spikes and transiently activates plant defence mechanisms, as pretreated spikes show a faster and stronger expression of the defence metabolism during the first 24 h after pathogen inoculation. This effect was transient and the expression of the same genes was lower in the pathogen-infected spikes than in those infected by P. olsonii alone. This response to the endophyte includes the transcriptional activation of several WRKY transcription factors. This early activation is associated with a reduction in FHB symptoms and significantly lower levels of the F. graminearum metabolites 15-acetyl-DON and culmorin.

17642,First Report of Root and Basal Stem Rot Caused by Phytophthora nicotianae on Tree Aeonium (Aeonium arboreum) in Italy.,"The genus Aeonium, family Crassulaceae, comprises approximately 35 species that are native to northern Africa and the Canary Islands. Tree aeonium (Aeonium arboreum (L.) Webb & Berthel.) is a bushy, perennial succulent with rosettes of tender, waxy leaves at the apex of few-branched or occasionally single, naked stems. Mature rosettes bear yellowish inflorescences. Aeoniums are cultivated as ornamentals in gardens and containers. During the summer of 2009, in a garden in eastern Sicily (southern Italy), 3-year-old potted plants of tree aeonium showed stunting, shrivelling, and chlorosis of leaves and drop of external leaves associated with root and basal stem rot. Drops of an amber exudate oozed from the basal stem. Tissues of the basal stem were soft, but no external necrosis was visible. A species of Phytophthora was consistently isolated from symptomatic roots and basal stem tissues on a medium selective for Oomycetes (2). Axenic cultures were obtained by single-hypha transfers. The pathogen was identified by morphological criteria as Phytophthora nicotianae B. de Haan; it formed stoloniferous colonies on potato dextrose agar and grew between 8 and 38°C, with the optimum at 30°C. On V8 juice agar it produced spherical, intercalary chlamydospores (mean diameter of 26 μm) and persistent, mono- and bipapillate, spherical to ovoid, ellipsoid, obpyriform sporangia that measured 29 to 56 × 22 to 45 μm with a mean length/breadth ratio of 1.3:1. All isolates were A2 mating type and formed spherical oogonia (mean diameter 28 ± 2 μm) with smooth walls and amphigynous antheridia in dual cultures with a reference isolate of the A1 mating type of P. nicotianae. BLAST analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA of a representative isolate from aeonium (IMI 398812, GenBank Accession No. HQ433333) amplified by PCR using the ITS6/ITS4 universal primers (1), revealed 99% similarity with the sequences of a reference isolate of P. nicotianae available in GenBank (Accession No. EU331089.1). Pathogenicity of isolate IMI 398812 was demonstrated by transplanting cuttings of A. arboreum into pots filled with a mixture of steam-sterilized sandy loam soil and inoculum (4% vol/vol) produced by growing the isolate for 20 days on wheat kernels. Ten plants were transplanted into 3-liter pots (two plants per pot) while 10 plants, transplanted into pots filled with a mixture of steam-sterilized soil and noninoculated kernels, were used as controls. Plants were kept in a greenhouse at 25 to 28°C and watered daily to field capacity. Thirty to forty days after the transplanting into infested soil, cuttings developed the same symptoms observed on plants with natural infections. Control plants remained symptomless. P. nicotianae was reisolated from symptomatic plants, thereby completing Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. nicotianae on an Aeonium species worldwide. The economic relevance of this disease is minor because aeoniums are not cultivated on a large scale. Moreover, the disease may be easily prevented by avoiding excess irrigation water since aeoniums need a well-drained soil or potting mix and do not tolerate soil waterlogging. References: (1) D. E.

17642,First Report of Root and Basal Stem Rot Caused by Phytophthora nicotianae on Tree Aeonium (Aeonium arboreum) in Italy.,"The genus Aeonium, family Crassulaceae, comprises approximately 35 species that are native to northern Africa and the Canary Islands. Tree aeonium (Aeonium arboreum (L.) Webb & Berthel.) is a bushy, perennial succulent with rosettes of tender, waxy leaves at the apex of few-branched or occasionally single, naked stems. Mature rosettes bear yellowish inflorescences. Aeoniums are cultivated as ornamentals in gardens and containers. During the summer of 2009, in a garden in eastern Sicily (southern Italy), 3-year-old potted plants of tree aeonium showed stunting, shrivelling, and chlorosis of leaves and drop of external leaves associated with root and basal stem rot. Drops of an amber exudate oozed from the basal stem. Tissues of the basal stem were soft, but no external necrosis was visible. A species of Phytophthora was consistently isolated from symptomatic roots and basal stem tissues on a medium selective for Oomycetes (2). Axenic cultures were obtained by single-hypha transfers. The pathogen was identified by morphological criteria as Phytophthora nicotianae B. de Haan; it formed stoloniferous colonies on potato dextrose agar and grew between 8 and 38°C, with the optimum at 30°C. On V8 juice agar it produced spherical, intercalary chlamydospores (mean diameter of 26 μm) and persistent, mono- and bipapillate, spherical to ovoid, ellipsoid, obpyriform sporangia that measured 29 to 56 × 22 to 45 μm with a mean length/breadth ratio of 1.3:1. All isolates were A2 mating type and formed spherical oogonia (mean diameter 28 ± 2 μm) with smooth walls and amphigynous antheridia in dual cultures with a reference isolate of the A1 mating type of P. nicotianae. BLAST analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA of a representative isolate from aeonium (IMI 398812, GenBank Accession No. HQ433333) amplified by PCR using the ITS6/ITS4 universal primers (1), revealed 99% similarity with the sequences of a reference isolate of P. nicotianae available in GenBank (Accession No. EU331089.1). Pathogenicity of isolate IMI 398812 was demonstrated by transplanting cuttings of A. arboreum into pots filled with a mixture of steam-sterilized sandy loam soil and inoculum (4% vol/vol) produced by growing the isolate for 20 days on wheat kernels. Ten plants were transplanted into 3-liter pots (two plants per pot) while 10 plants, transplanted into pots filled with a mixture of steam-sterilized soil and noninoculated kernels, were used as controls. Plants were kept in a greenhouse at 25 to 28°C and watered daily to field capacity. Thirty to forty days after the transplanting into infested soil, cuttings developed the same symptoms observed on plants with natural infections. Control plants remained symptomless. P. nicotianae was reisolated from symptomatic plants, thereby completing Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. nicotianae on an Aeonium species worldwide. The economic relevance of this disease is minor because aeoniums are not cultivated on a large scale. Moreover, the disease may be easily prevented by avoiding excess irrigation water since aeoniums need a well-drained soil or potting mix and do not tolerate soil waterlogging. References: (1) D. E.

8515,"Fungicidal and plant growth-promoting traits of Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae, an endophyte from Andrographis paniculata","IntrodutionFungal endophytes are widespread and dwell inside plant cells for at least part of their life without producing any symptoms of infection. Distinct host plants may have different fungal endophyte rates and community compositions. Despite this, the endophytic fungi connected with the host plant and their hostile behaviors, remain unknown. MethodsThe objective of the current research was to isolate and identify endophytic fungal species from the root of Andrographis paniculata. The effects of fungal isolate APR5 on the mycelial growth of phytopathogens and the production of plant-promoting traits were assessed. Results and discussionEndophytic fungal isolate APR5 showed higher inhibitory efficacy in dual and double plate assay against the tested phytopathogenic fungi. The scanning electron microscope analysis demonstrated that the phytopathogenic fungal hyphae were coiled by endophytes which makes them shrink and disintegrate.

18827,Isolation and optimization of Bacillus thuringiensis BRB-3 isolated from germinated black upland rice seeds for GABA production.,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a non-coded amino acid that recently gained increased attention within the functional food industry. This study aimed to isolate endophytic bacteria from sterilized surfaces of germinated black upland rice seeds for GABA production and optimization. A total of 38 isolates were screened for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity using a colorimetric method. Among these, thirteen isolates exhibited positive GAD activity. The BRB-3 strain emerged as the most promising, producing the highest GABA levels (4.54 g/L) at an optimal pH of 6.5. However, the BRB-3 strain was sensitive to pH lower than 5.5; so the pH was adjusted to 6.5 through all experiments. Further identification of the BRB-3 strain was performed using 16S rRNA gene sequence, which placed it in Bacillus cereus group. Subsequent rpoB gene sequence analysis confirmed that the BRB-3 strain was Bacillus thuringiensis BRB-3. GABA production was optimized in MRS broth by investigating carbon, nitrogen, monosodium glutamate (MSG), pH and temperature. Interestingly, the concentration of MSG did not impact GABA production of B. thuringiensis BRB-3. Under optimal conditions of 3 % soy protein as the nitrogen source, 2 % sucrose, no added MSG at 30 °C, pH 6.5 for 12 days, B. thuringiensis BRB-3 achieved a high GABA yield of 25.06 g/L (242.9 mM). Therefore, B. thuringiensis BRB-3 demonstrated significant potential for GABA production and could be utilized in various functional food products, including germinated rice seeds.",Wannasutta R; Boonlue S; Riddech N; Mongkolthanaruk W,Heliyon,2025,10.1016/j.heliyon.2025.e41884,0.962274364098553,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.958857076667196,0.0411429233328041,0.999987912668284,1.2087331715871e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,Cereus,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Cactaceae,NA,Cereus,ACCEPTED,Cereus,NA,NA,genus,cereus,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,seeds,1,United States,United States,NA,NA,upland,FALSE,United States; upland

The assay successfully detected the pathogen in individual hop cones and inflorescences throughout the season, with higher positive identification rates than culture-based assays. This assay will provide time-limited diagnosticians a tool for detection of D. humulicola.",Hatlen RJ; Szymanski S; Adair N; Fan Q; Panwar P; Sysak R; Miles LA; Higgins D; Rojas JA; Gent DH; Miles TD,Plant disease,2025,10.1094/PDIS-11-24-2331-SR,0.909496792664865,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.766505447188076,0.233494552811924,0.999975064717617,2.49352823830096e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain,NA,NA,NA,Diaporthe,Fungi,Ascomycota,Diaporthaceae,NA,Diaporthe,ACCEPTED,Diaporthe,NA,NA,genus,diaporthe,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,cones; rhizomes; leaves; rhizome; inflorescences,5,United States; Canada,United States; Canada,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States; Canada
10945,Evaluation of phytotoxic potential and identification of phytotoxic compounds in Rumex maritimus,"Rumex maritimus (Polygonaceae) is an annual herb and is well known for its use in medicinal treatments. Although the pharmacological properties of R. maritimus are well documented, no phytotoxic activity of R. maritimus has yet been found. Therefore, we investigated the phytotoxic potential of R. maritimus to identify phytotoxic compounds. Inhibitory activity was found in aqueous methanol extracts of R. maritimus on the seedling growth of cress, rapeseed, barnyard grass, and foxtail fescue, in which inhibition increased with increasing extract concentration. Two compounds were isolated using chromatography, and using spectroscopy their structure was determined as 5,7-dihydroxyphthalide and altechromone A. 5,7-Dihydroxyphthalide significantly inhibited cress seedling growth by 27.2-43.0% of control seedlings at 3mM, whereas altechromone A inhibited seedling growth by 65.4-66.3% at 0.01mM. The concentrations required for 50% inhibition of cress seedling growth were 1.73-2.48mM for 5,7-dihydroxyphthalide and 0.66-1.41mM for altechromone A. These results indicate that the compounds 5,7-dihydroxyphthalide and altechromone A may contribute, to a certain extent, to the phytotoxic activity of R. maritimus.","Islam, MS; Iwasaki, A; Suenaga, K; Kato-Noguchi, H",PLANT BIOSYSTEMS,2018,10.1080/11263504.2017.1338630,0.972318831123357,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.978538897651897,0.0214611023481026,0.999999852529865,1.47470134992389e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,rumex maritimus,rumex maritimus,2888980,Rumex maritimus,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Polygonaceae,Rumex,Rumex maritimus,ACCEPTED,Rumex maritimus,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,TRUE,NA

17371,"Effector candidates in the secretome of Piriformospora indica, a ubiquitous plant-associated fungus.","One of the emerging systems in plant-microbe interaction is the study of proteins, referred to as effectors, secreted by microbes in order to modulate host cells function and structure and to promote microbial growth on plant tissue. Current knowledge on fungal effectors derives mainly from biotrophic and hemibiotrophic plant fungal pathogens that have a limited host range. Here, we focus on effectors of Piriformospora indica, a soil borne endophyte forming intimate associations with roots of a wide range of plant species. Complete genome sequencing provides an opportunity to investigate the role of effectors during the interaction of this mutualistic fungus with plants.

18743,Genetic Blueprint for Stringent Response in Betaproteobacterial Aromatoleum/Azoarcus/Thauera Cluster.,"The Aromatoleum/Azoarcus/Thauera (AAT) cluster comprises anaerobic degradation specialists (Aromatoleum, Thauera) and N2-fixing endophytes (Azoarcus). Omics-based and genetic studies with associated model strains implicate stringent response (SR) in adaptation to nutrient limitation and plant colonization. SR is well-studied in standard bacteria such as Escherichia coli and known as adaptive strategy to nutrient limitations by adjusting e.g., transcription and stress response. SR involves the alarmone (p)ppGpp, whose cellular level is controlled by the synthetases/hydrolases RelA/SpoT and the noncanonical transcription factor DksA, whose interaction with RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding of (p)ppGpp enhances. DksA-mediated SR occurs across Proteobacteria and other phylogenetic groups such as Myxococcia and Spirochaetia, mostly applying to pathogens. Furthermore, all three DksA variants (four, two or one cysteine residue(s) for Zn2+-binding) were found. Genes encoding SR components are present in all studied 37 genomes representing 31 species from the AAT cluster. Each genome encodes a synthesizing RelA, a hydrolyzing SpoT, a four cysteine-containing DksA, and mostly also a one cysteine-containing DksA. Opposing functions of RelA and SpoT in Aromatoleum aromaticum EbN1T, Aromatoleum sp. strain CIB, Azoarcus olearius BH72, and Thauera aromatica K172T (also entire AAT cluster) are implicated by full conservation of amino acids (E and D vs. 2H2D motif and ED diad) essential for catalysis by their synthetase versus hydrolase domains. Likewise, functionality of the predicted C4-type DksAs from these four model strains was visually assessed by structural modeling and comparison of key features (binding sites for Zn2+/(p)ppGpp; CC tip for RNAP interaction) to those of the available E. coli DksA cryo-EM structure. SR as a global adaptation strategy should contribute to the success of the AAT cluster in its distinct habitats: complex and highly variable soils/sediments (high molecular and microbial diversity, fluctuating nutrient availabilities and redox states) of the free-living degradation specialists versus the defined endorhizosphere (more stable conditions, less complex community) of the endophytes. A noteworthy exception is Aromatoleum sp. strain CIB by combining degradation and endophytic features. Thus, future investigations into the role of SR in the habitat success of such bacteria reflecting their divergent environmental niches are needed as well as promising.",Becker P; Ruickoldt J; Wendler P; Reinhold-Hurek B; Rabus R,Microbial physiology,2025,10.1159/000546200,0.827165695949433,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.774960931366196,0.225039068633804,0.999999831962473,1.68037526893094e-7,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NO_MATCH,NA,NA,NA,none,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,NA,0,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States

We conducted the first investigations on kudzu fungal endophytes (Illumina MiSeq-ITS2) to elucidate drivers of endophytic communities across the heart of the invasive range in the Southeast United States (TN, MS, AL, GA). We tested the impacts of multiple environmental parameters (Chlorophyll, NO3-, K+, soil pH, leaf area, host genotype, traffic intensity, and geographic location) on foliar endophyte communities. Endophytic communities were diverse and structured by many factors in our PerMANOVA analyses, but location, genotype, and traffic (proxy for pollution) were the strongest drivers of community composition (R-2 = 0.152, p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.129, p < 0.001, and R-2 = 0.126, p < 0.001, respectively). Further, we examined the putative ecological interactions between endophytic fungi and plant pathogens. We identify numerous OTUs that are positively and strongly associated with pathogen occurrence, largely within the families Montagnulaceae and Tremellales incertae sedis.

9826,Drivers of Foliar Fungal Endophytic Communities of Kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata) in the Southeast United States,"Fungal endophytes play important roles in plant fitness and plant-microbe interactions. Kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata) is a dominant, abundant, and highly aggressive invasive plant in the Southeast United States. Kudzu serves as a pathogen reservoir that impacts economically important leguminous crops. We conducted the first investigations on kudzu fungal endophytes (Illumina MiSeq-ITS2) to elucidate drivers of endophytic communities across the heart of the invasive range in the Southeast United States (TN, MS, AL, GA). We tested the impacts of multiple environmental parameters (Chlorophyll, NO3-, K+, soil pH, leaf area, host genotype, traffic intensity, and geographic location) on foliar endophyte communities. Endophytic communities were diverse and structured by many factors in our PerMANOVA analyses, but location, genotype, and traffic (proxy for pollution) were the strongest drivers of community composition (R-2 = 0.152, p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.129, p < 0.001, and R-2 = 0.126, p < 0.001, respectively). Further, we examined the putative ecological interactions between endophytic fungi and plant pathogens. We identify numerous OTUs that are positively and strongly associated with pathogen occurrence, largely within the families Montagnulaceae and Tremellales incertae sedis. Taken together, these data suggest location, host genetics and local pollution play instrumental roles in structuring communities, and integrative plant management must consider these factors when developing management strategies.","Shahrtash, M; Brown, SP",DIVERSITY-BASEL,2020,10.3390/d12050185,0.79205699655224,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999202398705911,7.9760129408928e-4,0.999999998871438,1.12856191059052e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance,NA,NA,NA,Montagnulaceae,Fungi,Ascomycota,NA,NA,Montagnulaceae,ACCEPTED,Montagnulaceae,NA,NA,family,montagnulaceae,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,leaf,1,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States
11738,Differences in fungal communities associated to Festuca paniculata roots in subalpine grasslands,"Mycorrhizal fungi or endphytes colonize plant roots and their occurrence and composition depend on biotic and abiotic characteristics of the ecosystem. We investigated the composition of these microbial communities associated with Festuca paniculata, a slow growing species, which dramatically impacts functional plant diversity and the recycling of organic matter in subalpine grasslands. F. paniculata individuals from both mown and unmown grasslands were randomly collected and the microscopic observation of the plant roots revealed a difference in fungal colonization according to management. The ITS regions of root-associated fungi were amplified, cloned and sequenced. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a total of 43 and 35 phylotypes in mown and unmown grasslands respectively, highlighting a remarkable difference in the composition between both fungal communities. The phylotypes were assigned to 9 classes in which two classes Eurotiomycetes and Lecanoromycetes were specific to mown grasslands, while Tremellomycetes were specific to unmown grasslands and only five phylotypes were common to both locations. The comparative analysis of fungal lifestyles indicated the dominance of saprobes and a large proportion of endophytes compared to the mycorrhizal fungi (7/1 and 11/2 phylotypes in mown and unmown grasslands, respectively). Endophyte richness was greater in the unmown gassland than in the mown grassland and their relative proportion was twice higher. Our results suggest that endophytes may offer potential resources to F. paniculata and play an important role in the regulation of plant diversity.","Mouhamadou, B; Molitor, C; Baptist, F; Sage, L; Clément, JC; Lavorel, S; Monier, A; Geremia, RA",FUNGAL DIVERSITY,2011,10.1007/s13225-011-0091-3,0.95902169491842,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99127040723545,0.00872959276454972,0.999924481252004,7.55187479963837e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,festuca paniculata,festuca paniculata,NA,NA,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Poaceae,Patzkea,Patzkea paniculata,SYNONYM,Patzkea paniculata,Festuca paniculata,Patzkea paniculata,species,NA,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,molecular; microscopy,mycorrhizal; roots; root,3,South Africa,NA,South Africa,NA,subalpine; grassland,FALSE,South Africa; subalpine; grassland

9652,EFFECT OF SEED TREATMENT AND FERTILIZER COATED WITH FLUTRIAFOL ON BLACKLEG OF CANOLA (OILSEED RAPE) IN WESTERN CANADA,"The systemic fungicide flutriafol coated on fertilizers at various dosages and applied as a seed treatment was evaluated against blackleg disease [Leptosphaeria maculans] of spring canola (Brassica napus and B. rapa) in extensive field trials in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Marginal and variable control of the disease was obtained. Analyses with gas chromatography for flutriafol residues in plant materials from field trials indicated that the fungicide was taken up and was present in canola plants throughout the growing season. The highest quantities were detected in plants from a coated mono-calcium phosphate treatment. Isolations made from samples of plant material collected in field trials showed that the fungicide treatments had limited effects on infection early in the season. There is no definite answer as to why blackleg has been successfully controlled with flutriafol-coated fertilizer in Australia, but not in western Canada. Soil types and pH in the optimum range for agricultural practice did not have major effects on the efficacy of the treatments.

9652,EFFECT OF SEED TREATMENT AND FERTILIZER COATED WITH FLUTRIAFOL ON BLACKLEG OF CANOLA (OILSEED RAPE) IN WESTERN CANADA,"The systemic fungicide flutriafol coated on fertilizers at various dosages and applied as a seed treatment was evaluated against blackleg disease [Leptosphaeria maculans] of spring canola (Brassica napus and B. rapa) in extensive field trials in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Marginal and variable control of the disease was obtained. Analyses with gas chromatography for flutriafol residues in plant materials from field trials indicated that the fungicide was taken up and was present in canola plants throughout the growing season. The highest quantities were detected in plants from a coated mono-calcium phosphate treatment. Isolations made from samples of plant material collected in field trials showed that the fungicide treatments had limited effects on infection early in the season. There is no definite answer as to why blackleg has been successfully controlled with flutriafol-coated fertilizer in Australia, but not in western Canada.

5527,"Multi-Gene Phylogeny and Taxonomy of Hypoxylon (Hypoxylaceae, Ascomycota) from China","The Hypoxylon species play an important ecological role in tropical rainforest as wood-decomposers, and some might have benefical effects on their hosts as endophytes. The present work concerns a survey of the genus Hypoxylon from Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park of China. Four new species: H. wuzhishanense, H. hainanense, H. chrysalidosporum, and H. cyclobalanopsidis, were discovered based on a combination of morphological characteristics and molecular data. Hypoxylon wuzhishanense is characterized by Rust pulvinate stromata, amyloid apical apparatus and brown ascospores, with most of the perispore being indehiscent in 10% KOH. Hypoxylon hainanense has effused-pulvinate and Violet stromata, amyloid apical apparatus, light-brown to brown ascospores with straight germ slit and dehiscent perispore. Hypoxylon chrysalidosporum is distinguished by glomerate to pulvinate stromata, highly reduced or absent inamyloid apical apparatus, and light-brown to brown ascospores with very conspicuous coil-like ornamentation. Hypoxylon cyclobalanopsidis has Livid Purple pulvinate stromata, highly reduced amyloid apical apparatus, faint bluing, brown ascospores and dehiscent perispore, and it grows on dead branches of Cyclobalanopsis. Detailed descriptions, illustrations, and contrasts with morphologically similar species are provided. Phylogenetic analyses inferred from ITS, RPB2, LSU, and beta-tubulin sequences confirmed that the four new species are distinct within the genus Hypoxylon.","Ma, HX; Song, ZK; Pan, XY; Li, Y; Yang, ZE; Qu, Z",DIVERSITY-BASEL,2022,10.3390/d14010037,0.850428508707803,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999598383889507,4.0161611049309e-4,0.999999970332221,2.96677792333e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,Beta,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Amaranthaceae,NA,Beta,ACCEPTED,Beta,NA,NA,genus,beta,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,wood; branches,2,China,NA,China,NA,tropical; rainforest,FALSE,China; tropical; rainforest; tropical; rainforest
20855,"Isolation, identification and field control efficacy of an endophytic strain against tobacco bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacarum)","In this paper, an endophytic strain B-001 against tobacco bacterial wilt (Ralstonia solanacarum) was isolated from the stem of healthy tobacco in R. solanacarum-infected fields, which had a stronger inhibitory effect on some kinds of gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and pathogenic fungi. This strain belonged to Bacillus, and its 16S rDNA after PCR and sequencing had an accession of GenBank being DQ444283. The 16S rDNA phylogenetic tree was constructed with MEGA3, and compared with the published 16S rDNA sequences of relative bacteria species. B-001 had a 99.2% sequence similarity with Bacillus subtilis (DQ415893). According to the morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics, and based on phylogenetic analysis, B-001 was identified as a strain of B. subtilis. Field experiments in Guiyang and Ningxiang counties of Hunan Province showed that in 2005 and 2006, the control efficacy of B-001 on R. solanacarum ranged from 40.03% to 78.14%, better than that of Streptomycini.",Yi Y.-J.; Liu R.-S.; Yin H.-Q.; Luo K.; Liu E.-M.; Liu X.-D.,Chinese Journal of Applied Ecology,2007,NA,0.940000009131294,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.523845461129013,0.476154538870987,0.999973356925842,2.6643074158117e-5,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NO_MATCH,NA,NA,NA,none,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,stem,1,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States

3035,Genotypic variation in Norway spruce correlates to fungal communities in vegetative buds,"The taxonomically diverse phyllosphere fungi inhabit leaves of plants. Thus, apart from the fungi's dispersal capacities and environmental factors, the assembly of the phyllosphere community associated with a given host plant depends on factors encoded by the host's genome. The host genetic factors and their influence on the assembly of phyllosphere communities under natural conditions are poorly understood, especially in trees. Recent work indicates that Norway spruce (Picea abies) vegetative buds harbour active fungal communities, but these are hitherto largely uncharacterized. This study combines internal transcribed spacer sequencing of the fungal communities associated with dormant vegetative buds with a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 478 unrelated Norway spruce trees. The aim was to detect host loci associated with variation in the fungal communities across the population, and to identify loci correlating with the presence of specific, latent, pathogens. The fungal communities were dominated by known Norway spruce phyllosphere endophytes and pathogens. We identified six quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with the relative abundance of the dominating taxa (i.e., top 1% most abundant taxa). Three additional QTLs associated with colonization by the spruce needle cast pathogen Lirula macrospora or the cherry spruce rust (Thekopsora areolata) in asymptomatic tissues were detected. The identification of the nine QTLs shows that the genetic variation in Norway spruce influences the fungal community in dormant buds and that mechanisms underlying the assembly of the communities and the colonization of latent pathogens in trees may be uncovered by combining molecular identification of fungi with GWAS.","Elfstrand, M; Zhou, LH; Baison, J; Olson, Å; Lundén, K; Karlsson, B; Wu, HX; Stenlid, J; García-Gil, MR",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2020,10.1111/mec.15314,0.877208892107549,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999562667428176,4.3733257182415e-4,0.99999996235711,3.76428902493231e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,picea abies,picea abies,5284884,Picea abies,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Pinaceae,Picea,Picea abies,ACCEPTED,Picea abies,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,molecular,leaves; buds,2,Norway,Norway,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,Norway

10508,"Aspergillus luchuensis, an Endophyte Fungus from the Metal Hyperaccumulator Plant Prosopis laevigata, Promotes Its Growth and Increases Metal Translocation","Heavy metal pollution is a worldwide environmental and human health problem. Prosopis laevigata is a hyperaccumulator legume that bioaccumulates Pb, Cu and Zn. With interest in designing phytoremediation strategies for sites contaminated with heavy metals, we isolated and characterized endophytic fungi from the roots of P. laevigata growing on mine tailings located in Morelos, Mexico. Ten endophytic isolates were selected by morphological discrimination and a preliminary minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for zinc, lead and copper. A novel strain of Aspergillus closest to Aspergillus luchuensis was determined to be a metallophile and presented a marked tolerance to high concentrations of Cu, Zn and Pb, so it was further investigated for removal of metals and promotion of plant growth under greenhouse conditions. The control substrate with fungi promoted larger size characters in P. laevigata individuals in comparison with the other treatments, demonstrating that A. luchuensis strain C7 is a growth-promoting agent for P. laevigata individuals.

13880,Effects of some fungicides on Rhizobium trifolii and its symbiotic relationship with white clover,"A comparison has been made of the effects of some protective and systemic fungicides, and an eradicant fungicide, on the growth, metabolic activity and nitrogen‐fixing capacity of Rhizobium trifolii. Effects on the bacterium grown in vitro with a combined nitrogen source were not necessarily reflected in the nitrogen‐fixing capacity of excised nodulated roots of white clover. Symbiotic nitrogen fixation was affected by thiram, oxycarboxin and “Ethylan CP”, but was unchanged by benomyl, captan, carbendazim, carboxin, dodine, dimethirimol, ethirimol, tridemorph, triforine or thiophanate‐methyl. None of the fungicides tested altered the leghaemoglobin content of the root nodules.

3609,Microbial communities in crop phyllosphere and root endosphere are more resistant than soil microbiota to fertilization,"Crop harbors diverse microbial communities that profoundly influence host health and agricultural productivity. Crop habitat is a dynamic and heterogeneous environment, and thus crop microbiota may display spatial organization across different compartments. However, impacts of long-term fertilization, as a common agricultural practice, on the assembly of crop microbiota and their relationships with crop yield and quality remain largely unresolved. Here, we collected sorghum roots and leaves, and rhizosphere and bulk soils, from an eight-year field experiment with multiple fertilization regimes, and characterized sorghum-associated microbiomes by amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS region. Rhizosphere and bulk soils harbored significantly higher diversity of bacteria and fungi than phyllosphere and root endophytes, and the microbial community composition significantly differed across the four compartments. Fertilization significantly influenced the diversity and compositions of sorghum-associated microbial communities, but had more pronounced effects on rhizosphere and bulk soil microbiomes through altering the relative abundances of some major microbial bio-markers.

6059,Phytochemical Screening and Biological Activities of Fungal Phyllosticta capitalensis Derived from Andrographis paniculata,"The research aims to evaluate the phytochemical constituents and biological activity (antibacterial and antioxidant activity) of the extract of endophytic fungi isolated from the seeds of Andrographis paniculata. Isolation of endophytic fungus followed the dilution method with Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) media. Three single strains of fungi have been isolated from seeds of A. panicalata. They were cultivated on the white, black, and red rice media for three weeks, respectively. Extraction of the cultivated fungi with ethyl acetate followed by evaporation yielded the crude extract. The antibacterial and antioxidant activity were evaluated for nine crude extracts of fungi. Data of their biological activities showed that the ethyl acetate extract from fungus SAP-1 on the black rice media was the rich of active compounds. Molecular identification showing the fungus SAP-1 was Phyllosticta capitalensis. Further research of isolation and structure elucidation of bioactive compounds from fungal P. capitalensis obtained from the seeds of A. paniculata will be performed in the future.

9910,Fungal endophytic communities associated to the phyllosphere of grapevine cultivars under different types of management,"Fungal endophytes present in different asymptomatic grapevine plants (Vitis vinifera L.) located in different vineyards within Alentejo, a highly important viticulture region in Portugal, were identified in this study. Sampled grapevine plants included the three most representative cultivars in the region, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Aragonez, growing under two different modes of management, conventional and biological. Sixteen fungal taxa were identified through sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region. Total number of endophytic fungi isolated showed significant differences both in management mode and in cultivars, with higher numbers in grapevines under conventional mode and from Syrah cultivar. The composition of fungal endophytic communities did not show significant differences among cultivars, but differences were observed between fungal communities isolated from grapevines under biological or conventional modes. The most fungal taxa isolated from grapevines cultivated under biological mode were Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium sp., and Nigrospora oryzae, and under conventional mode Botrytis cinerea, Epicoccum nigrum, and Epicoccum sp. These differences suggest that the different products used in grapevine production have impacts in fungal endophytic composition.

Sampled grapevine plants included the three most representative cultivars in the region, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Aragonez, growing under two different modes of management, conventional and biological. Sixteen fungal taxa were identified through sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region. Total number of endophytic fungi isolated showed significant differences both in management mode and in cultivars, with higher numbers in grapevines under conventional mode and from Syrah cultivar. The composition of fungal endophytic communities did not show significant differences among cultivars, but differences were observed between fungal communities isolated from grapevines under biological or conventional modes. The most fungal taxa isolated from grapevines cultivated under biological mode were Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium sp., and Nigrospora oryzae, and under conventional mode Botrytis cinerea, Epicoccum nigrum, and Epicoccum sp.

11136,Resistance to triadimefon and benomyl: Dynamics and impact on managing cucurbit powdery mildew,"Frequency of fungicide-resistant strains of Podosphaera xanthii on pumpkins in New York before treatment varied from 3 to 80% for the demethylation inhibiting (DMI) fungicide triadimefon and from 0 to 48% for the benzimidazole fungicide benomyl between 1993 and 1996. When the initial frequency of triadimefon-resistant strains was less than 55%, one application of triadimefon plus chlorothalonil was effective. This application was made after reaching the action threshold of one leaf with powdery mildew symptoms per 50 old leaves (defined as the oldest third of the foliage). The frequency of triadimefon-resistant strains increased from 3 to 71% by 20 days after the first fungicide application in 1993. Triadimefon in the second application did not contribute to control. Loss of efficacy was due to resistance because, compared with triadimefon-treated pumpkins, pumpkins treated with other systemic fungicides were less severely infected by powdery mildew on abaxial leaf surfaces where the companion multi-site contact fungicide contributes little to control. Triadimefon was not effective in 1995 when 80% of the pathogen population was resistant before treatment. Benomyl was effective in 1995, but not in 1996 when 48% of the isolates tested were resistant to both benomyl and triadimefon before treatment. An in-field seedling assay was developed to determine local occurrence of resistant strains before the first treatment was needed. Although sensitivity of the pathogen population to the DMI fungicides myclobutanil and propiconazole also decreased after they were applied, these fungicides were more effective than triadimefon.","McGrath, MT; Shishkoff, N",PLANT DISEASE,2001,10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.2.147,0.881489840232616,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.797445556270847,0.202554443729153,0.999999511303005,4.8869699542653e-7,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain,podosphaera xanthii,podosphaera xanthii,NA,NA,Fungi,Ascomycota,Erysiphaceae,Podosphaera,Podosphaera fusca,SYNONYM,Podosphaera fusca,Podosphaera xanthii,Podosphaera fusca,species,NA,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,leaf; leaves; foliage,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA

11136,Resistance to triadimefon and benomyl: Dynamics and impact on managing cucurbit powdery mildew,"Frequency of fungicide-resistant strains of Podosphaera xanthii on pumpkins in New York before treatment varied from 3 to 80% for the demethylation inhibiting (DMI) fungicide triadimefon and from 0 to 48% for the benzimidazole fungicide benomyl between 1993 and 1996. When the initial frequency of triadimefon-resistant strains was less than 55%, one application of triadimefon plus chlorothalonil was effective. This application was made after reaching the action threshold of one leaf with powdery mildew symptoms per 50 old leaves (defined as the oldest third of the foliage). The frequency of triadimefon-resistant strains increased from 3 to 71% by 20 days after the first fungicide application in 1993. Triadimefon in the second application did not contribute to control. Loss of efficacy was due to resistance because, compared with triadimefon-treated pumpkins, pumpkins treated with other systemic fungicides were less severely infected by powdery mildew on abaxial leaf surfaces where the companion multi-site contact fungicide contributes little to control. Triadimefon was not effective in 1995 when 80% of the pathogen population was resistant before treatment. Benomyl was effective in 1995, but not in 1996 when 48% of the isolates tested were resistant to both benomyl and triadimefon before treatment.

19620,"General Limitations to Endophytic Entomopathogenic Fungi Use as Plant Growth Promoters, Pests and Pathogens Biocontrol Agents.","The multiple roles of fungal entomopathogens in host plants' growth promotion, pest and pathogen management have drawn huge attention for investigation. Endophytic species are known to influence various activities of their associated host plants, and the endophyte-colonized plants have been demonstrated to gain huge benefits from these symbiotic associations. The potential application of fungal endophytes as alternative to inorganic fertilizers for crop improvement has often been proposed. Similarly, various strains of insect pathogenic fungi have been formulated for use as mycopesticides and have been suggested as long-term replacement for the synthetic pesticides that are commonly in use. The numerous concerns about the negative effects of synthetic chemical pesticides have also driven attention towards developing eco-friendly pest management techniques. However, several factors have been underlined to be militating the successful adoption of entomopathogenic fungi and fungal endophytes as plant promoting, pests and diseases control bio-agents. The difficulties in isolation and characterization of novel strains, negative effects of geographical location, vegetation type and human disturbance on fungal entomopathogens, are among the numerous setbacks that have been documented. Although, the latest advances in biotechnology and microbial studies have provided means of overcoming many of these problems. For instance, studies have suggested measures for mitigating the negative effects of biotic and abiotic stressors on entomopathogenic fungi in inundative application on the field, or when applied in the form of fungal endophytes. In spite of these efforts, more studies are needed to be done to achieve the goal of improving the overall effectiveness and increase in the level of acceptance of entomopathogenic fungi and their products as an integral part of the integrated pest management programs, as well as potential adoption as an alternative to inorganic fertilizers and pesticides.",Bamisile BS; Siddiqui JA; Akutse KS; Ramos Aguila LC; Xu Y,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,10.3390/plants10102119,0.996216147435534,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.978819117964916,0.0211808820350841,0.999996068017573,3.93198242654158e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NO_MATCH,NA,NA,NA,none,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA

This metabolite may thus have a function in substrate defence after the switch from the endophytic to the saprotrophic period in the life-cycle of P. medicaginis following the death of infected host tissue.","Weber, RWS; Stenger, E; Meffert, A; Hahn, M",MYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH,2004,10.1017/S0953756204000243,0.827860372826166,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997213474930291,0.00278652506970871,0.999999998226982,1.7730180656983e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,Medicago,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Fabaceae,NA,Medicago,ACCEPTED,Medicago,NA,NA,genus,medicago,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,culture,shoots; lesions; stems; lesion,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA
2667,Short-Term Effects of Different Organic Amendments on Soil Fungal Composition,"Fungi play an essential role in recovering the quality and fertility of soil. There is a limited understating of the complex response of fungal diversity to different organic materials in clay loam soil. Here, we report the response of soil fungi toward the short-term application of manure (M), sugarcane straw (S), and sugarcane straw plus manure (MS), including no organic material control (CK) at two different time points (50 and 100 days after application). Illumina sequencing was used to examine the fungal communities. Our results reveal a significant shift among the soil fungal community structure associated with each organic material application. After both time points, amendments-especially M and MS-decreased the fungal richness and stimulated the copiotrophic fungal group (Ascomycota) compared to the control soil (CK) and S-amended soil. On the contrary, as compared to the M and MS-amended soils, the CK and S-amended soils at both time points increased the fungal richness and stimulated the oligotrophic fungal groups. Organic material use, especially M and MS, showed variable results regarding pathogenic fungi enhancing the abundance of Lophodermium and Cercophora and decreasing Fusarium. Concerning the abundance of plant-beneficial fungi, Mortierella was reduced, and Podospora was increased by M and MS input. FUNGuild showed that the amendment of organic materials efficiently declined the abundance of endophytes and plant pathogens, but also enhanced the animal pathogens in terms of abundance with respect to CK at two time points.

2433,"Growth, persistence, and alkaloid levels of endophyte-infected and endophyte-free ryegrass pastures grazed by dairy cows in northern New Zealand","A farm-scale trial was conducted over three years at the Dairying Research Corporation, Hamilton, New Zealand to compare the growth and persistence of endophyte-infected and endophyte-free perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) pastures established with or without white clover (Trifolium repens), when rotationally grazed by dairy cows. Endophyte-free ryegrass areas were also undersown with endophyte-free seed in March and April of the second and third years, respectively. Average total herbage yields were similar for all treatments in each of the three years, ranging from 12.8 to 13.9 t DM ha(-1). Pasture growth rates in all treatments were lowest in the first summer/autumn after drilling, averaging 17 kg DM ha(-1) day(-1) for 90 days, coinciding with the highest herbage concentrations of lolitrem B (2.37 to 3.04 mu g g(-1) DM) in the high-endophyte ryegrass.

12517,High Diversity of Epicoccum Species Associated with Leaf Spot on Italian Ryegrass in Southwestern China: Six New Records and Three New Species,"Italian ryegrass is widely cultivated for the production of forage, hay, and silage because of its high nutritional value and good palatability. Leaf spots caused by fungi pose a serious threat to forage crops. In order to expand the knowledge of fungi causing leaf spots in ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) in Sichuan, Yunnan, Chongqing, and Guizhou of southwestern China, a comprehensive survey was undertaken from 2015 to 2022. The survey discovered that Epicoccum leaf spot (ELS) was a common and widespread disease, more serious at the late stage of growth (after late May). Symptomatic leaf samples collected from the four different provinces were analyzed, and a total of 202 Epicoccum isolates were obtained. Based on both multilocus phylogeny (ITS, LSU, TUB2, and RPB2) and morphology, 10 Epicoccum species were finally identified, including three novel species (E. endololii sp. nov., E. lolii sp. nov., and E. loliicola sp. nov.), six new host records (E. draconis, E. endophyticum, E. oryzae, E. plurivorum, E. thailandicum, and E. tobaicum), and an unknown species (Epicoccum sp.1). Pathogenicity tests showed that E. endophyticum, E. endololii, and Epicoccum sp.1 were nonpathogenic to Italian ryegrass, which were confirmed as endophytes in this study; the other six species could infect Italian ryegrass and cause leaf lesions to different degrees, of which E. draconis was more aggressive (P <= 0.05). Coupled with the isolation rates and geographical distributions of these species, it was found that E. plurivorum was the predominant pathogen in Yunnan while E. oryzae and E. tobaicum were the predominant pathogens in the other three provinces. This work provides an initial understanding of the taxonomy, virulence, and distribution of Epicoccum species associated with ELS in southwestern China and lays a solid foundation for the diagnosis in the field and scientific control of ELS on Italian ryegrass.","Xu, ZT; Xu, LL; Liu, JQ; Chen, DY; Cui, HW; Xue, LH; Li, CJ",PLANT DISEASE,2024,10.1094/PDIS-06-23-1044-RE,0.964047878729758,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98601864574541,0.0139813542545903,0.999998180896028,1.81910397190066e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,lolium multiflorum,lolium multiflorum,4129708,Lolium multiflorum,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Poaceae,Lolium,Lolium multiflorum,ACCEPTED,Lolium multiflorum,NA,NA,species,NA,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,leaf; lesions,2,China,NA,China,NA,NA,FALSE,China

In order to expand the knowledge of fungi causing leaf spots in ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) in Sichuan, Yunnan, Chongqing, and Guizhou of southwestern China, a comprehensive survey was undertaken from 2015 to 2022. The survey discovered that Epicoccum leaf spot (ELS) was a common and widespread disease, more serious at the late stage of growth (after late May). Symptomatic leaf samples collected from the four different provinces were analyzed, and a total of 202 Epicoccum isolates were obtained. Based on both multilocus phylogeny (ITS, LSU, TUB2, and RPB2) and morphology, 10 Epicoccum species were finally identified, including three novel species (E. endololii sp. nov., E. lolii sp. nov., and E. loliicola sp. nov.), six new host records (E. draconis, E. endophyticum, E. oryzae, E. plurivorum, E. thailandicum, and E. tobaicum), and an unknown species (Epicoccum sp.1). Pathogenicity tests showed that E. endophyticum, E. endololii, and Epicoccum sp.1 were nonpathogenic to Italian ryegrass, which were confirmed as endophytes in this study; the other six species could infect Italian ryegrass and cause leaf lesions to different degrees, of which E. draconis was more aggressive (P <= 0.05). Coupled with the isolation rates and geographical distributions of these species, it was found that E. plurivorum was the predominant pathogen in Yunnan while E. oryzae and E. tobaicum were the predominant pathogens in the other three provinces. This work provides an initial understanding of the taxonomy, virulence, and distribution of Epicoccum species associated with ELS in southwestern China and lays a solid foundation for the diagnosis in the field and scientific control of ELS on Italian ryegrass.","Xu, ZT; Xu, LL; Liu, JQ; Chen, DY; Cui, HW; Xue, LH; Li, CJ",PLANT DISEASE,2024,10.1094/PDIS-06-23-1044-RE,0.964047878729758,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98601864574541,0.0139813542545903,0.999998180896028,1.81910397190066e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,Lolium,Plantae,Tracheophyta,Poaceae,NA,Lolium,ACCEPTED,Lolium,NA,NA,genus,lolium,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,leaf; lesions,2,China,NA,China,NA,NA,FALSE,China

277,Diversity and antimicrobial activity of endophytic fungi isolated from Securinega suffruticosa in the Yellow River Delta,"Securinega suffruticosa (Pall.) Rehd is an excellent natural secondary shrub in the Shell Islands of Yellow River Delta. The roots of S. suffruticosa have high medicinal value and are used to treat diseases, such as neurasthenia and infant malnutrition. Any organism that is isolated from this species is of immense interest due to its potential novel bioactive compounds. In this research, the distribution and diversity of culturable endophytic fungi in S. suffruticosa were studied, and the endophytic fungi with antimicrobial activity were screened. A total of 420 endophytic fungi isolates were obtained from the S. suffruticosa grown in Shell Islands, from which 20 genera and 35 species were identified through morphological and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analyses. Chaetomium, Fusarium, Cladosporium, and Ceratobasidium were the dominant genera. The high species richness S (42), Margalef index D' (5.6289), Shannon-Wiener index H' (3.1000), Simpson diversity index D-s (0.9459), PIE index (0.8670), and evenness Pielou index J (0.8719) and a low dominant index lambda (0.0541) indicated the high diversity of endophytic fungi in S. suffruticosa, the various species of endophytic fungi with obvious tissue specificity. The inhibition percentages of the 12 species of such endophytic fungi against Colletotrichum siamense were 3.6%-26.3%. C. globosum, Fusarium sp.3, and C. ramotenellum had a high antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) were between 0.5 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL. Alkaloid content detection indicated that endophytic fungi had a high alkaloid content, whereas the alkaloid contents of C. globosum and Fusarium sp.3 reached 0.231% and 0.170%, respectively. Members belonging to the endophytic fungal community in the S. suffruticosa of Shell Islands that may be used as antagonists and antibacterial agents for future biotechnology applications were identified for the first time.","Du, W; Yao, ZG; Li, JL; Sun, CL; Xia, JB; Wang, BG; Shi, DL; Ren, LL",PLOS ONE,2020,10.1371/journal.pone.0229589,0.979689381983151,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999877235493897,1.2276450610285e-4,0.999999999979638,2.03617123162303e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,Chaetomium,Fungi,Ascomycota,Chaetomiaceae,NA,Chaetomium,ACCEPTED,Chaetomium,NA,NA,genus,chaetomium,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,molecular; culture,roots,1,United States,United States,NA,NA,river,FALSE,United States; river
13580,Effects of atmospheric pollutants on phyllosphere and endophytic fungi,"Focuses on 1) in vitro effects of dry and wet deposition of SO2 and O3 on phyllosphere and endophyte fungi; 2) impact of atmospheric SO2 on specific fungi when pre-inoculated on to host-plant seedlings; and 3) effect of open-air fumigation on phyllosphere and endophyte fungi. Complex interactions may occur between biotic factors (eg fungi and insects) and stresses due to different atmospheric pollutants, and the role of phyllosphere fungi in forest decline syndromes should be seen in this context. -P.J.Jarvis",Magan N.; Smith M.K.; Kirkwood I.A.,Fungi and environmental change,1996,10.1017/cbo9780511753190.008,0.847684645393567,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.875541552142212,0.124458447857788,0.999999981274576,1.87254236561074e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NO_MATCH,NA,NA,NA,none,NA,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,NA,0,United States,United States,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,United States
