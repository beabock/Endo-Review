QUALITY CONTROL RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Manual review of high-confidence absence cases recommended
2. Verify methodological adequacy for studies claiming absence
3. Check for potential false positives in absence detection
4. Consider context of absence claims (e.g., specific conditions)

NEXT STEPS:
1. Expert review of high_confidence_absence_evidence.csv
2. Quality assessment of methodological rigor
3. Integration with species-level absence patterns
4. Use absence_evidence_analysis.csv for further analysis
