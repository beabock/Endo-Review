"Absence","1. Pathogens can affect their hosts and change community composition and structure. Pathogens may be key determinants of biological invasions. However, few empirical studies exist examining how non-native plants drive their invasions through indirect effects involved with pathogens. Here, indirect effects refer to how one species alters the effect that another species has on a third. 2. Fusarium palustre was associated with the dieback of Spartina alterniflora in its native North American saltmarshes. Native plant Phragmites australis was also found to die back in the Dongtan wetland of the Chinese Yangtze River estuary invaded by non-native Spartina alterniflora. This phenomenon suggests that Spartina might not escape from its pathogen when being introduced from its native North America and has indirectly caused the dieback of Phragmites in China. 3. To investigate the indirect effect of Spartina involving Fusarium, we sampled plants and soils in dieback patches to isolate the pathogen. Next, we used an artificial inoculation study to determine the virulence of Fusarium to both Phragmites and Spartina. Finally, the spatial distribution of Fusarium was studied through examining its incidence in saltmarshes along the east coast of China. 4. The endophytic fungus F. palustre was found to be closely associated with Phragmites dieback in the Dongtan wetland and it is likely that it was transported by non-native Spartina from its native North American saltmarshes to the Chinese saltmarshes. The spillover of F. palustre from non-native Spartina to native Phragmites might subsequently facilitate Spartina invasion. 5. Synthesis. Invasive plants do not only directly compete with native plants, but also indirectly cause pathogen infection on the latter, by acting as vectors and reservoirs for pathogens shared with native plants. Our findings highlight the significance of indirect effects involving pathogens in biological invasions. It is necessary to consider these pathogen-mediated indirect effects of non-native plant species in multi-host-pathogen systems for management and restoration purposes.",53,"Indirect effects of non-native <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> and its fungal pathogen (<i>Fusarium palustre</i>) on native saltmarsh plants in China","Li, H; Zhang, XM; Zheng, RS; Li, X; Elmer, WH; Wolfe, LM; Li, B",NA,NA,NA,"Li, Hui; Zhang, Xiameng; Zheng, Rushui; Li, Xiao; Elmer, Wade H.; Wolfe, Lorne M.; Li, Bo",NA,NA,"JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Li, Bo/B-8016-2010","Li, Bo/0000-0002-0439-5666",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0022-0477","1365-2745",NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2014,"102","5",NA,NA,NA,"1112","1119","10.1111/1365-2745.12285","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12285",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000340681300002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,51,0.0693814588032057,0.930618541196794,"Absence","Absence",0.172500505532855,0.827499494467145,"Uncertain"
"Absence","Although fungal endophytes of grasses have been known since the 1930s, their economic importance was not recognized until an association was made in the late 1970s between Acremonium coenophialum Morgan-Jones and Gams and a toxicity syndrome in livestock consuming tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.). Cattle consuming endophyte-infected tall fescue have reduced growth, conception, milk production, and intolerance to heat. In horses, high foal mortality and agalactia occur on endophyte-infected grass. Sheep consuming perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) infected with the endophyte Acremonium lolii Latch, Christensen and Samuels are afflicted with a staggers syndrome, resulting in reduced weight gain. Endophyte-free, as compared with infected tall fescue, can increase steer weight gains by 30 to over 100% and furnish normal conception and milk production in beef cows. Since most tall fescue pastures in the USA are infected with the endophyte, livestock economic losses are high. Beef cattle annual losses are conservatively estimated at $354 million in reduced calf numbers and $255 million in reduced weaning weights, The poor performance of beef steers on infected tall fescue pasture has prevented its use for stocker production, resulting in higher production costs on high-quality winter annual pastures. Foal mortality of mares grazing tall fescue can be high, but no estimate of losses is available. Wild rabbit populations are reduced when consuming tall fescue. The mutualistic symbiosis of the endophyte and the grass confers a number of benefits on the host plant such as insect and nematode resistance, drought tolerance, and improved competition with other plant species. Endophyte infection of turf grasses confers improved growth and resistance to environmental stresses. In contrast, the use of endophyte-free grass cultivars for improved animal performance results in plants less tolerant of pests, drought, and overgrazing. Stand losses of endophyte-free tall fescue have been greatest on farms in the southern part of the USA tall fescue belt where environmental stresses are greatest. Better grazing management practices are necessary to maintain stands and productivity of endophyte-free grass cultivars. Ideally, modification of the fungal endophyte to remove the harmful properties and maintain those beneficial to the host plant is the ultimate solution. The increasing number of scientists from many disciplines attracted to research on the grass-endophyte relationship offers much promise for the future.",691,"IMPORTANCE AND ECONOMIC-SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ACREMONIUM ENDOPHYTES TO PERFORMANCE OF ANIMALS AND GRASS PLANT","HOVELAND, CS",NA,NA,NA,"HOVELAND, CS",NA,NA,"AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT",NA,NA,NA,"INTERNATIONAL SYMP ON ACREMONIUM-GRASS INTERACTIONS","NOV 05-07, 1990","NEW ORLEANS, LA","USDA ARS, USDA CRS, USDA, LOUISIANA AGR EXPT STN",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0167-8809",NA,NA,NA,NA,"MAR",1993,"44","1-4",NA,NA,NA,"3","12","10.1016/0167-8809(93)90036-O","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0167-8809(93)90036-O",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1993KZ99700002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,659,0.0575974484925155,0.942402551507485,"Absence","Absence",2.76303709911829e-08,0.999999972369629,"Absence"
"Absence","As herbivory usually leads to loss of photosynthesizing biomass, its consequences for plants are often negative. However, in favorable conditions, effects of herbivory on plants may be neutral or even beneficial. According to the compensatory continuum hypothesis plants can tolerate herbivory best in resource-rich conditions. Besides herbivory, also primarily positive biotic interactions like mycorrhizal symbiosis, bear carbon costs. Tritrophic plant-fungus-herbivore interaction further complicates plant's cost-benefit balance, because herbivory of the host plant is expected to cause decline in mycorrhizal colonization under high availability of soil nutrients when benefits of symbiosis decline in relation to costs. To gain insight into above interactions we tested the effects of plant size and resource manipulation (simulated herbivory and fertilization) on both above-ground performance and on root fungal colonization of the biennial Gentianella campestris. Clipping caused allocation shift from height growth to branches in all groups except in large and fertilized plants. For large plants nutrient addition may have come too late, as the number of meristems was most likely determined already before the fertilization. Clipping decreased the amount of DSE (dark septate endophytic) fungi which generally are not considered to be mycorrhizal. The effect of clipping on total fungal colonization and colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal coils were found to depend on host size and resource level. Dissimilar mycorrhizal response to simulated herbivory in small vs. large plants could be due to more intensive light competition in case of small plants. Carbon limited small plants may not be able to maintain high mycorrhizal colonization, whereas large clipped plants allocate extra resources to roots and mycorrhizal fungi at the expense of above-ground parts. Our results suggest that herbivory may increase carbon limitation that leads re-growing shoots and fungal symbionts to function as competing sinks for the limited carbon reserves.

"Absence","Background Fusarium odoratissimum (Foc TR4) is a devastating fungal pathogen that causes Panama wilt in Caven-dish banana, a high value crop that generates significant revenue. The excessive use of synthetic fungicides for disease control poses risks to both human health and the environment. Consequently, there is a pressing need for ecofriendly alternatives to manage this disease. One potential approach is the utilization of biocontrol agents, which have shown promise in disease control. This study aimed to evaluate the biocontrol potential of fungal endophytes isolated from the naturally-resistant cultivar Cardaba banana against Foc TR4. These fungal isolates were subjected to a dual culture assay, characterized based on morpho-cultural characteristics, and confirmed molecularly using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA. Results Of the 15 fungal endophytes isolated from Cardaba; Blakeslea trispora, Pseudopestalotiopsis theae, Xylaria badia, Nigrospora hainanensis, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Xylaria feejeensis, Gymnoascus reessii, Fusarium subglutinans, Rigidoporus vinctus, and Macrophomina phaseolina showed potential antagonistic activity against F. odoratissimum. Isolates X. feejeensis (USMJMTBL10), G. reesii (USMJMTBL11), and M. phaseolina (USMJMTBR1) had the highest antagonistic activity of 87.8-96.6% against F. odoratissimum in vitro. Conclusion This study presents evidence of the potential of Cardaba-associated endophytes isolated and identified in this research, as effective biocontrol agents against F. odoratissimum, the causal agent of Panama disease in Caven-dish banana. Our findings suggest that these endophytes hold promise as a biocontrol agent for managing Foc TR4-infected banana plants. Future research will focus on in planta testing, validation in greenhouse and field trials, as well as development of formulations and application protocols to optimize the utilization of these biocontrol agents in an integrated management approach for Foc TR4-infected bananas.",1101,"Fungal endophytes as potential biocontrol agent of Panama disease of banana","Taping, JMF; Borja, BT; Bretaña, BLP; Tanabe, MEN; Cabasan, MTN",NA,NA,NA,"Taping, Jonah Mae F.; Borja, Bernadith T.; Bretana, Bryan Lloyd P.; Tanabe, Maria Elena N.; Cabasan, Ma.

"Absence","Biosynthetic potential of fungal endophytes from medicinal plants represents an attractive source for discovery of new bioactive metabolites. Present study involved characterizing metabolite(s) of non-pathogenic, endophytic Fusarium oxysporum designated ZzEF8 which was identified previously from Zingiber zerumbet rhizome to display antagonism towards Pythium myriotylum [62.2 +/- 2.58% percent of inhibition (PoI)], an oomycetous phytopathogen of significant economic concern. Efficacy of ZzEF8 in suppressing soft rot by P. myriotylum was further evaluated by planting ginger rhizomes primed with ZzEF8 conidial suspension (10(6) conidia/ ml) followed by transplanting the primed rhizome in sterile soil infested with P. myriotylum (10(3) zoospores/g soil). Batch fermentation followed by solvent extraction yielded a dark red solid (0.45 mg/ml) which after fractionation by silica column (500 x 30 mm) chromatography (100-200 mu) using chloroform: methanol (8:2) solvent yielded three fractions, F1-3. Validation of inhibitory activity of the fractions by disc diffusion assay identified F2 to exhibit absolute P. myriotylum growth inhibition (100%) while F1 and F3 showed 57.62% and 10.73% inhibition respectively. Further purification of F2 by silica column chromatography (300 x 10 mm) yielded three sub-fractions viz., F2a-c. Further LC/Q -TOF MS-analysis of the three sub-fractions identified F2a to contain umbelliferone (t(R) 6.93 min) as major metabolite. Batch fermentation under submerged conditions was thence optimized for optimal metabolite production. Evaluation of cytotoxicity of F2a and F2b fractions in HeLa cell lines revealed F2a to display cytotoxic effect with IC50 value of 57.9 mu g/ml.

However, the use of plant endophytes might be beneficial. The pragmatic role of endophytic fungi Aspergillus flavus (Ch-01) in tomato under Cd and Cr stress was, therefore, investigated. A. flavus enhanced growth attributes in tomato seedlings under Cd and Cr stress. Besides, it remediated Cd and Cr toxicity by reducing their translocation from the roots to the upper part of the tomato plants. In fact, A. flavus associated plants developed tolerance against Cd and Cr toxicity via the expression of SlGSH1 and SlPCS1 genes. Both genes helped in metal chelation and mitigation of Cd and Cr toxicity. From the results, it is concluded that A. flavus is a plant growth promoting and HMs alleviating endophyte, hence it might be used as a biofertilizer.",1626,"<i>Aspergillus Flavus</i> reprogrammed morphological and chemical attributes of <i>Solanum lycopersicum</i> through <i>SlGSH1</i> and <i>SlPCS1</i> genes modulation under heavy metal stress","Aziz, L; Hamayun, M; Rauf, M; Iqbal, A; Husssin, A; Khan, SA; Irshad, M; Lee, IJ",NA,NA,NA,"Aziz, Laila; Hamayun, Muhammad; Rauf, Mamoona; Iqbal, Amjad; Husssin, Anwar; Khan, Sumera Afzal; Irshad, Muhammad; Lee, In-jung",NA,NA,"JOURNAL OF PLANT INTERACTIONS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Iqbal, Amjad/E-2010-2014; Khan, Abdul/H-5910-2011; Lee, In-Jung/GLS-0432-2022; Irshad, Muhammad/JQW-6402-2023; Hamayun, Muhammad/B-1694-2010; Rauf, Mamoona/AAC-3246-2019","Iqbal, Amjad/0000-0001-6141-8337; Rauf, Mamoona/0000-0001-7756-0741",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1742-9145","1742-9153",NA,NA,NA,"JAN 1",2021,"16","1",NA,NA,NA,"104","115","10.1080/17429145.2021.1903105","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17429145.2021.1903105",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000632625800001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1561,0.0900422556179945,0.909957744382005,"Absence","Absence",0.00582750577295232,0.994172494227048,"Absence"

Microscopic features of positive isolates revealed that the enzyme producers were Aspergillus sp., Fusarium sp., Alternaria sp., Trichoderma sp., Exerohilum sp., Nigrospora sp., Curvularia sp., Cladosporium sp., Cochliobolus sp., Tricothecium sp., Penicillium sp., Verticillium sp., and Cephalosporium sp. The amylolytic activity was remarkable in the case of endophytic Aspergillus sp. and Fusarium sp. Also, Aspergillus sp. and Alternaria sp. had proteolytic activity. Aspergillus sp., Mycelia sterilia-2, and Trichoderma sp. were potent lipase producers. Along with Exerohilum sp. endophyticAspergillus sp. had positive laccase activity. The tannic acid degrading activity was highest for Aspergillus sp. APL11 followed by Helicosporium sp. and Fusarium sp. Tannase producing ability of Aspergillus sp. was optimized and an incubation time- 96h, incubation temperature- 29 degrees C, initial medium pH- 6.5, carbon source- glucose, and nitrogen source- NaNO3 exhibited a two-fold scale-up of (2.83 +/- 0.05 u mL-1) in tannase action. These enzymes offer eco-friendly and efficient solutions across a wide range of industrial processes including food production, textile processing, and pharmaceutical synthesis. Fungal endophytes of medicinal plants act as an alternative source for hydrolysing enzymes.",2554,"Exploitation of Selected Fungal Endophytes of<i> Andrographis</i><i> paniculata</i> (Burm. f.)

"Absence","Endophytic bacteria inevitably form mutualistic relationships with plants and supply numerous benefits without causing peripheral infection or adverse effects on their host. They are omnipresent and may be found in a variety of habitats, including terrestrial and mangrove environments, spanning the plant kingdom. The need for bioactive compounds in medicines has skyrocketed in recent years. Because of their intimate association with their host plant, bacterial endophytes might be investigated for biotechnologically important products, including antibiotics, proteins, enzymes, and others. Bioactive compounds produced by bacterial endophytes possess numerous biological properties corresponding to antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticancer activities. Therefore, endophytes are an essential replacement for overcoming pathogen drug resistance due to their enormous diversity and long-term tolerance to environmental conditions. Bacterial endophytes have a tremendous impact on the floral community by boosting their growth, raising their fitness by targeting pests and plant pathogens. The major focus of the review relies on the isolation and identification of bacterial endophytes from diverse habitats and illustrates their various potential applications in the pharmaceutical, industrial, and agricultural sectors as well as in nanotechnology for the fabrication of various nanoparticles incorporated into different applications.",2595,"Insights into bacterial endophytic diversity and isolation with a focus on their potential applications -A review","Kandasamy, GD; Kathirvel, P",NA,NA,NA,"Kandasamy, Gayathri Devi; Kathirvel, Preethi",NA,NA,"MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0944-5013","1618-0623",NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2023,"266",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.micres.2022.127256","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2022.127256",NA,"NOV 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36410317,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000899781200005",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2493,0.00799084938395411,0.992009150616046,"Absence","Uncertain",0.21437725465546,0.78562274534454,"Uncertain"
"Absence","Endophytic flora plays a vital role in the colonization and survival of host plants, especially in harsh environments, such as arid regions. This flora may, however, contain pathogenic species responsible for various troublesome host diseases. The present study is aimed at investigating the diversity of both cultivable and non-cultivable endophytic fungal floras in the internal tissues (roots and leaves) of Tunisian date palm trees (Phoenix dactylifera). Accordingly, 13 isolates from both root and leaf samples, exhibiting distinct colony morphology, were selected from potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium and identified by a sequence match search wherein their 18S-28S internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences were compared to those available in public databases. These findings revealed that the cultivable root and leaf isolates fell into two groups, namely Nectriaceae and Pleosporaceae. Additionally, total DNA from palm roots and leaves was further extracted and ITS fragments were amplified. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the ITS from 200 fungal clones (leaves: 100; roots: 100) using HaeIII restriction enzyme revealed 13 distinct patterns that were further sequenced and led to the identification of Alternaria, Cladosporium, Davidiella (Cladosporium teleomorph), Pythium, Curvularia, and uncharacterized fungal endophytes. Both approaches confirmed that while the roots were predominantly colonized by Fusaria (members of the Nectriaceae family), the leaves were essentially colonized by Alternaria (members of the Pleosporaceae family). Overall, the findings of the present study constitute, to the authors' knowledge, the first extensive report on the diversity of endophytic fungal flora associated with date palm trees (P. dactylifera).",2609,"Fungal diversity in adult date palm (<i>Phoenix dactylifera</i> L.) revealed by culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches","Ben Chobba, I; Elleuch, A; Ayadi, I; Khannous, L; Namsi, A; Cerqueira, F; Drira, N; Gharsallah, N; Vallaeys, T",NA,NA,NA,"Ben Chobba, Ines; Elleuch, Amine; Ayadi, Imen; Khannous, Lamia; Namsi, Ahmed; Cerqueira, Frederique; Drira, Noureddine; Gharsallah, Neji; Vallaeys, Tatiana",NA,NA,"JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE B",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Vallaeys, Tatiana/AAE-5508-2019; Neji, Gharsallah/AAD-4663-2022","Elleuch, Amine/0000-0001-8425-1656; Ayadi, Imen/0000-0003-4325-4900; Namsi, Ahmed/0000-0003-3493-8788; drira, Noureddine/0000-0003-3026-2776",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1673-1581","1862-1783",NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2013,"14","12",NA,NA,NA,"1084","1099","10.1631/jzus.B1200300","http://dx.doi.org/10.1631/jzus.B1200300",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24302709,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000328342100003",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2507,0.0114662898850687,0.988533710114931,"Absence","Uncertain",0.395342995692457,0.604657004307543,"Uncertain"

The current study determined the antimicrobial properties and identify the chemical compounds of secondary metabolites produced by endophytic fungi isolated from Sceletium tortuosum L. A total of 60 endophytic fungi produced secondary metabolites that were detected after fermentation and extraction. Antibacterial properties of the secondary metabolites were determined using the disc diffusion assay against pathogenic environmental Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as control stains. The chemical compounds were characterized by GC-MS. Overall, 15% of fungal extracts displayed narrow spectrum of activity against the bacteria strains. Despite this, none of the fungal extracts inhibited growth of Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC S1299) and Enterococcus gallinarum (ATCC 700425) while Bacillus cereus (ATCC 10876) was the most susceptible against the fungal extracts.

"Absence","Endophytic fungi live inside plant tissues but do not cause any disease. Several reports have now revealed that they have great influence on host. In this study, the beneficial role of endophytic fungi is highlighted and explored. Endophytic fungi isolated from healthy plants were identified as Aspergillus terreus, Curvularia lunata, C. hawaiiensis, Macrophomina phaseolina, Fusarium solani, Talaromyces assiutensis, and T. trachyspermus using 18S rRNA gene sequencing. In vitro, fungi evaluated for antimicrobial activity, showed significant activity. These fungi were tested in field application by exploring their broad spectrum. Talaromyces assiutensis and T. trachyspermus were applied in pots and field plot experiments using sunflower as test plants, along with endophytic Cephalosporium sp., and Chaetomium sp. Endophytic fungi showed significant activity against root rot pathogens affecting sunflower and improved plant biomass. They also improved production of plant defense biochemical markers (polyphenolic content and salicylic acid) with improvement in antioxidant potential. These fungi are used as biological control agents, so their culture filtrates are used to check the presence of metabolites by GC-MS. Several new compounds were isolated from T. assiutensis. The major bioactive compounds are Coumarin, 3,4-dihydro-6-methoxy-4,4-dimethyl, 1-Monolinoleoylglycerol trimethylsilyl ether, 1,2-Propanediol, 3-(octadecyloxy), Ethyl iso-allocholate, and 1H-Pyrazole, which possess antioxidant, antitumor, antibacterial, anticancer, and antimicrobial properties.

"Absence","Endophytic fungi with the ability to produce plant based secondary metabolites are a potential alternative for producing the host plant metabolite and to prevent natural plants from extinction. To isolate a high metabolite yielding endophytic strain from plants, hundreds of endophytic strains are screened and tested for product yield separately under axenic state, before shortlisting the potential endophyte, which involves huge time consumption. In this study, strategies for screening and selection of high camptothecin yielding endophytes from their natural habitat were proposed. A correlation was built between the camptothecin yield in the explants and the endophytes isolated from them. In addition, camptothecin yield was compared between the endophytes isolated from young and matured plants. Further, camptothecin producers and non-producers strains were compared for their tolerance toward camptothecin. The study indicates that high camptothecin yielding endophytes were isolated from high yielding explants and younger plants and they were more tolerant to camptothecin in comparison to non-camptothecin yielding endophytes. Thus, choosing a young and high yielding explant for endophyte isolation, and use of camptothecin as a selective agent in the growth medium, can be instrumental in screening and selection of high camptothecin yielding endophytes from nature in relatively less time.",3158,"Screening and selection of camptothecin producing endophytes from <i>Nothapodytes nimmoniana</i>","Mohinudeen, IAHK; Pandey, S; Kanniyappan, H; Muthuvijayan, V; Srivastava, S",NA,NA,NA,"Mohinudeen, I.

"Absence","Ethnopharmacological relevance: Plants of the Schisandraceae family have a rich and medicinal history dating back to ancient times. Many of them are used as folk medicine in the treatment of chronic coughs, asthma, nocturnal emission, spontaneous sweating, night sweats, palpitation, insomnia and thirst. Aim of the review: The current review is carried out on triterpenoids from the Schisandraceae family, aiming to comprehensively summarize their phytochemistry, pharmacology and synthesis and provide new insights to the chemical and pharmacological study and rational utilization on medicinal plants of the Schisandarceae family. Materials and methods: The information was searched from the scientific literature published from June 2014 to November 2021 on the online databases (including PubMed, CNKI, Elsevier, SciFinder and Web of Science) and other bibliography (e.g. the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, 2020 edition, Chinese herbal books). The scientific literature related to phytochemistry, pharmacology, biological activites and synthesis of triterpenoids from the Schisandraceae family was gathered. Results: From June 2014 to November 2021, there were approximately 211 novel triterpenoids isolated and identified from 18 species of the Schisandraceae family. These compounds exhibit tremendous diversity in their structures, and some of them possess promising pharmacological activities, including anti-viral, anti-tumor, antiinflammatory, hepatoprotective, immunosuppressive activities and neuroprotective effects. In the attempt to synthesize active compounds, the total synthesis of 13 schinortriterpenoids belonging to five structural types was successfully completed. Conclusions: Studies of triterpenoids from the Schisandraceae family are well documented in this review (from June 2014 to November 2021), and it is also well acknowledged that they are valuable resources with medicinal efficacy. However, relevant pharmacological studies are limited to in vitro tests, and data from in vivo studies and toxicology are lacking or unavailable. Fortunately, there is growing interest in the synthesis of active compounds, which should serve as an approach for accessing active compounds to develop in vivo or toxicity studies, with a view of clarifying their in vitro and vivo mechanisms for more effective and safe natural drugs.",3371,"Schisandraceae triterpenoids: A review of phytochemistry, bioactivities and synthesis","Zhang, YQ; Liu, Y; Zhang, ZP; Wu, DD; Zhuang, LX; Algradi, AM; Kuang, HX; Yang, BY",NA,NA,NA,"Zhang, Yi-Qiang; Liu, Yan; Zhang, Zhen-Peng; Wu, Dan -Dan; Zhuang, Lei-Xin; Algradi, Adnan Mohammed; Kuang, Hai-Xue; Yang, Bing -You",NA,NA,"FITOTERAPIA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Liu, Yonghong/E-3118-2014; Wu, Dan/AAW-6234-2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0367-326X","1873-6971",NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2022,"161",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.fitote.2022.105230","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fitote.2022.105230",NA,"JUN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35688285,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000832274500007",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3239,0.052243805184963,0.947756194815037,"Uncertain","Uncertain",0.413475913900504,0.586524086099496,"Uncertain"

"Absence","Fungal endophytes are known to produce numerous secondary metabolites with different chemical structures. These metabolites assist host plants to overcome both abiotic and biotic stresses. Fungal extracts are screened for various properties, including antioxidant and antimicrobial. The need for novel antimicrobials is ever-increasing due to resistance developed by pathogenic fungi. Fungal endophytes can provide new solutions to the existing problem of antibiotic resistance. The information in this chapter will be useful for the applications of secondary metabolites of fungal endophytes as well as the conservation of medicinal plants without harvesting.

"Absence","Fungi are ubiquitous and essential to ecosystem functioning and biotechnology and have been estimated to have a global value of US$ 54.57 trillion annually. This is the eleventh in a series of Mycosphere notes where we provide entries on new species and higher taxa, new host records, geographical (country) records, and habitat records of fungi. Species boundaries were defined using polyphasic approaches based on morphology and molecular phylogeny. In the set of notes, we introduce ten new species, Conlarium multiseptatum, , Co. yunnanense, , Cudonia gracilistipitata, Cu. yunnanensis, , Cyathicula dioscoreae, , Cy. . rusci, , Helminthosporium guizhouense, , Neopestalotiopsis neomaricae, , Plectania submilleri, , and Plenodomus shangrilaense. . In addition, we reveal ecological relationships of Ascomycota including 22 new host records ( Apiospora guizhouensis, , A. phyllostachydis, , Colletotrichum dematium, , Distoseptispora suoluoensis, , Dothiorella plurivora, , Gloniopsis calami, , Junewangia lamma, , Kirschsteiniothelia atra, , Lasiodiplodia hormozganensis, , Letendraea helminthicola, , Melomastia winteri, , Nectria asiatica, , Neoostropa castaneae, , Nigrograna magnolia, , Nigrospora macarangae, , N. oryzae, , N. sphaerica, , Parasporendocladia bactrospora, , Plenodomus artemisiae, , Pseudoacrodictys deightonii, , Pseudofusicoccum adansoniae, , and Torula mackenziei); ); five new geographical records ( Caesiodiscus populicola, , Codinaea aseptate, , C. fertilis, , Mycotribulus indonesiae, , Tricladium terrestre, , and Vaginatispora nypae); ); seven recognitions of both new host and geographical records ( Allocryptovalsa rabenhorstii, , Barriopsis stevensiana, , Distoseptispora thysanolaenae, , Massarioramusculicola chiangraiensis, , Peroneutypa longiasca, , Phomatospora uniseriate, , and Thyridaria aureobrunnea); ); five newly identified habitat records ( Conlarium sichuanense, , Distoseptispora crassispora, , D. nonrostrata, , Pestalotiopsis trachicarpicola, , Talaromyces variabilis); ); one new host and habitat record ( Distoseptispora dehongensis), ), and one new host, geographical and habitat record ( Amphisphaeria uniseptata). ). An unusual asexual Basidiomycota, , Mycotribulus indonesiae ( Physalacriaceae ), was revealed as a new geographical record. Furthermore, we provide new molecular data for all 52 collected species belonging to two phyla, six classes, 20 orders, 30 families and 39 genera. A list of all genera discussed in Mycosphere notes 1-520 - 520 is provided. The fungal species were found as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes on plant material and litter substrates from terrestrial, freshwater, and cave habitats in China, Italy, Iran, and Thailand. This study extends our understanding of fungal taxonomy, biodiversity, ecology, and distribution, and encourages future research in unexplored geographies, habitats and among fungal hosts that have yet to be studied.",4000,"Mycosphere Notes 469-52","Hyde, K; Wijesinghe, SN; Afshari, N; Aumentado, HD; Bhunjun, CS; Boonmee, S; Camporesi, E; Chethana, KWT; Doilom, M; Dong, W; Du, TY; Farias, ARG; Gao, Y; Jayawardena, RS; Karimi, O; Karunarathna, SC; Kularathnage, N; Lestari, AS; Li, CJY; Li, YX; Liao, CF; Liu, XF; Lu, L; Lu, YZ; Luo, ZL; Ma, J; Mamarabadi, M; Manawasinghe, IS; Mapook, A; Mi, LX; Niranjan, M; Senanayake, IC; Shen, HW; Su, HL; Tibpromma, S; Xu, RJ; Yan, JY; Yang, YH; Yang, YY; Yu, FQ; Kang, JC; Zhang, JY",NA,NA,NA,"Hyde, K.

DC. leaves (Asteraceae). The structure elucidation and complete assignment of the isolated metabolites were performed mainly by the aid of various NMR and MS data. Fusarithioamide B (6) has been assessed for antibacterial and antifungal activities towards various microbial strains by disc diffusion assay. It exhibited selective antifungal activity towards C. albicans (MIC 1.9 µg/ml and IZD 14.5 mm), comparing to clotrimazole (MIC 2.8 µg/ml and IZD 17.9 mm). Also, it possessed high antibacterial potential towards E. coli, B. cereus, and S. aureus compared to ciprofloxacin. Furthermore, 6 was tested for the in vitro cytotoxic effect against KB, HCT-116, BT-549, MCF-7, SKOV-3, and SK-MEL cell lines. It had selective and potent effect towards BT-549, MCF-7, SKOV-3, and HCT-116 cell lines with IC50s 0.09, 0.21, 1.23, and 0.59 μM, respectively compared to doxorubicin (IC50s 0.046, 0.05, 0.321, and 0.24 μM, respectively).

"Absence","In the present study, we isolated a potent endophytic fungus from the roots of Withania somnifera. The endophytic fungal strain was authenticated as Penicillium ramusculum SVWS3 based on morphological and molecular sequencing using four gene data and phylogenetic analyses. In vitro cytotoxicity studies unveiled the remarkable cytotoxic potential of the crude extract derived from P. ramusculum, exhibiting dose-dependent effects on MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells. At a concentration of 100 mu g/mL, the crude extract resulted in cell viability of 29.78% for MDA-MB-468 cells and 14.61% for MCF-7 cells. The IC50 values were calculated as 62.83 +/- 0.93 mu g/mL and 17.23 +/- 1.43 mu g/mL, respectively for MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 cells. Caspase activation assay established the underlying mechanism of the crude extract depicting the activation of caspases 3 and 7, indicating the induction of apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Chemotaxonomic profiling elucidated the ability of P. ramusculum to synthesize a diverse array of bioactive compounds, including Fasoracetam, Tryprostatin B, Odorinol, Thyronine, Brevianamide F, Proglumide, Perlolyrine, Tyrphostin B48, Baptifoline, etc. Molecular docking studies inferred that Baptifoline, Brevianamide F, Odorinol, Perlolyrine, Thyronine, Tryphostin B48, and Tryprostatin B were the lead compounds that could effectively interact with the five selected target receptors of breast cancer, further surpassing the positive controls analyzed. Pharmacokinetic profiling revealed that Baptifoline, Odorinol, and Thyronine depicted an excellent therapeutic profile of druggability. These findings collectively substantiate the anticancer activity of bioactive metabolites synthesized by P. ramusculum SVWS3. Hence, the endophytic P. ramusculum SVWS3 can be an authentic source for developing novel chemotherapeutic drug formulations.",4593,"Molecular authentication, metabolite profiling and in silico-in vitro cytotoxicity screening of endophytic <i>Penicillium ramusculum</i> from <i>Withania somnifera</i> for breast cancer therapeutics","Varghese, S; Jisha, MS; Rajeshkumar, KC; Gajbhiye, V; Haldar, N; Shaikh, A",NA,NA,NA,"Varghese, Sherin; Jisha, M.

"Absence","In this study, the biodiversity of endophytic bacteria of cultivated grape varieties from the vineyards of Primorsky Krai, Russia, was analyzed for the first time. Far Eastern grape varieties with a high level of stress resistance are a unique object of research as they are cultivated in cold and humid climates with a short summer season. Grapevine endophytic microorganisms are known as promising agents for the biological control of grapevine diseases and agricultural pests. Using genomic approaches, we analyzed the biodiversity of the endophytic bacteria and fungi in the most common grape varieties of Primorsky Krai, Russia: Vitis vinifera x Vitis amurensis cv. Adele (hybrid No. 82-41 F-3), Vitis riparia x V. vinifera cv. Mukuzani (pedigree unknown), two cultivars Vitis labrusca x V. riparia cv. Alfa, and Vitis Elmer Swenson 2-7-13 cv. Prairie Star for the first time. The main representatives of the endophytic microorganisms included 16 classes of bacteria and 21 classes of fungi. The endophytic bacterial community was dominated by Gammaproteobacteria (31-59%), followed by Alphaproteobacteria (9-34%) and, to a lesser extent, by the classes Bacteroidia (9-22%) and Actinobacteria (6-19%). The dominant fungal class was Dothideomycetes (43-77%) in all samples analyzed, with the exception of the grapevine cv. Mukuzani from Makarevich, where Malasseziomycetes was the dominant fungal class. In the samples cv. Alfa and cv. Praire Star, the dominant classes were Tremellomycetes and Microbotriomycetes. A comparative analysis of the endophytic communities of the cultivated grape varieties and the wild grape V. amurensis Rupr. was also carried out. We found that 18-20% of the variance between the endophytic communities accounted for the differences between the cultivated and wild grapevines, while the factors ""plant location"" and ""individual plants"" accounted for 50-56% and 3-10% of the variance, respectively.

"Absence","Loline alkaloids (LA), which are 1-aminopyrrolizidines with an oxygen bridge, are produced by Epichloe (anamorph=Neotyphodium) species, endophytes of grasses. LA are insecticidal, thus, helping to protect host plants from insect herbivory. The objective of this study was to identify genes associated with LA biosynthesis. Suppression subtractive hybridization PCR was used to isolate transcripts up-regulated during LA production in cultures of Neotyphodium uncinatum. Subtracted cDNAs were cloned and a lambda-phage cDNA library from an LA-expressing N. uncinatum culture was screened with subtracted cDNA. In BLAST searches, several cDNAs identified had sequence similarities to aspartate kinases and another with O-acetylhomoserine-(thiol)lyase. Differential expression of these two genes in LA-producing cultures of N. uncinatum was confirmed and in a survey of 23 isolates from 21 Neotyphodium and Epichloe species these two genes strictly correlated with LA production. These findings open up the possibility for detailed studies on genes and enzymes involved in LA production. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

"Absence","Lolium multiflorum is a successful invader of postagricultural succession in the Inland Pampa grasslands in Argentina, becoming a dominant species in the plant community. Individual plants of this annual species are naturally highly infected with fungal endophytes (Neotyphodium sp.) from early successional stages. We assessed the effect of Neotyphodium infection on the biology of L. multiflorum. We evaluated growth attributes between endophyte infected (E+) and uninfected (E-) plants under non-competitive conditions during the normal growing season. E+ plants produced significantly more vegetative tillers and allocated more biomass to roots and seeds. Although seed germination rates were greater in endophyte free plants, the rate of emergence and the final proportion of emerged seedlings were similar between the biotypes. The greater production of vegetative tillers, and the greater resource allocation to roots and seeds are likely to confer an ecological advantage to E+ plants, thus enabling their dominance over the E- individuals in natural grasslands.",5048,"Fungal endophyte infection changes growth attributes in <i>Lolium multiflorum</i> Lam","Vila-Aiub, MM; Gundel, PE; Ghersa, CM",NA,NA,NA,"Vila-Aiub, MM; Gundel, PE; Ghersa, CM",NA,NA,"AUSTRAL ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Vila-Aiub, Martin/A-9961-2008","Vila-Aiub, Martin/0000-0003-2118-290X; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1442-9985","1442-9993",NA,NA,NA,"FEB",2005,"30","1",NA,NA,NA,"49","57","10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01423.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1442-9993.2005.01423.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000227062400005",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4852,0.460225623649717,0.539774376350283,"Uncertain","Uncertain",0.468765124897847,0.531234875102153,"Uncertain"

"Absence","Objective: To investigate the antioxidant activity of methanolic extract of endophytic fungi isolated from Calotropis procera plant. Methods: The endophytic fungi were isolated from explants of leaf, stem, and flower of C. procera on potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium. The fungal isolates were mass cultured in PDB. The methanolic extracts of these fungi were prepared and evaluated for the antioxidant activity by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging assay and reducing power assay. The extracts were characterized for the presence of phenolics and flavonoids. Results: A total of 8 endophytic fungi were isolated from C. procera explants. Out of these 8 fungal isolates, the crude extracts of two fungi, i.e. CPIMR-2 and CPIL-1 showed positive antioxidant activity. From the morphological characteristics, the isolates CPIMR-2 and CPIL-1 were identified as Penicillium spp. and Aspergillus spp., respectively. Both the isolates were found to possess antioxidant potential with % inhibition value of 81.16% and 80.97% in the DPPH radical scavenging assay. The phytochemical screening of the methanolic extracts showed the presence of phenolics and flavonoids. The total flavonoids content in Penicillium species and Aspergillus species were found to be 130.50 µg/mg and 94.91 µg/mg of extracts, respectively. The total phenolic content was found to be 9.16 µg/mg and 12.13 µg/mg of extracts in Penicillium species and Aspergillus species, respectively. Conclusions: Endophtyic fungi were found to be present in medicinal value plant C. procera. The probable bioactive component for antioxidant activity possessed by the fungi would be the flavonoids and phenolics. These metabolite produced by endophytic fungi from C. procera need to be explored further as potential source of novel natural antioxidant compound. © 2017 The Authors.",5702,"Isolation and characterization of endophytic fungi from Calotropis procera for their antioxidant activity","Nagda V.; Gajbhiye A.; Kumar D.",NA,"",NA,"Nagda, Vipin (57193549811); Gajbhiye, Archana (16401562500); Kumar, Dinesh (57202478116)",NA,NA,"Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research",NA,NA,"English","","","","",NA,"Antioxidant; Calotropis procera; Endophytes; Flavonoids; Radical scavenging; Reducing power","ascorbic acid; flavonoid; fungal extract; methanol; penicillin derivative; phenol derivative; antioxidant activity; Article; Aspergillus; Calotropis procera; controlled study; DPPH radical scavenging assay; endophytic fungus; flower; fungus culture; fungus isolation; nonhuman; Penicillium; plant leaf; plant stem","Department of Biotechnology, Sir Padampat Singhania University, Udaipur, 313 601, Rajasthan, India; Department of Biotechnology, B.N.P.G.

"Absence","Oxidative stress is involved in the pathophysiology of multiple health complications, and it has become a major focus in targeted research fields. As known, black seeds are rich sources of bio-active compounds and widely used to promote human health due to their excellent medicinal and pharmaceutical properties. The present study investigated the antioxidant potency of various black seeds from plants and their derived mycoendophytes, and determined the total phenolic and flavonoid contents in different extracts, followed by characterization of major constituents by HPLC analysis. Finally, in silico docking determined their binding affinities to target myeloperoxidase enzymes. Ten dominant mycoendophytes were isolated from different black seed plants. Three isolates were then selected based on high antiradical potency and further identified by ITS ribosomal gene sequencing. Those isolated were Aspergillus niger TU 62, Chaetomium madrasense AUMC14830, and Rhizopus oryzae AUMC14823. Nigella sativa seeds and their corresponding endophyte A. niger had the highest content of phenolics in their n-butanol extracts (28.50 and 24.43 mg/g), flavonoids (15.02 and 11.45 mg/g), and antioxidant activities (90.48 and 81.48%), respectively, followed by Dodonaea viscosa and Portulaca oleracea along with their mycoendophytic R. oryzae and C. madrasense. Significant positive correlations were found between total phenolics, flavonoids, and the antioxidant activities of different tested extracts. The n-butanol extracts of both black seeds and their derived mycoendophytes showed reasonable IC50 values (0.81-1.44 mg/ml) compared to the control with significant correlations among their phytochemical contents. Overall, seventeen standard phenolics and flavonoids were used, and the compounds were detected in different degrees of existence and concentration in the examined extracts through HPLC analysis. Moreover, the investigation of the molecular simulation results of detected compounds against the myeloperoxidase enzyme revealed that, as a targeted antioxidant, rutin possessed a high affinity (-15.3184 kcal/mol) as an inhibitor. Taken together, the black seeds and their derived mycoendophytes are promising bio-prospects for the broad industrial sector of antioxidants with several valuable potential pharmaceutical and nutritional applications.",5869,"<i>In Vitro</i> and <i>In Silico</i> Antioxidant Efficiency of Bio-Potent Secondary Metabolites From Different Taxa of Black Seed-Producing Plants and Their Derived Mycoendophytes","Hassane, AMA; Hussien, SM; Abouelela, ME; Taha, TM; Awad, MF; Mohamed, H; Hassan, MM; Hassan, MHA; Abo-Dahab, NF; El-Shanawany, ARA",NA,NA,NA,"Hassane, Abdallah M.

"Absence","Papaveraceae encompasses some of the most significant and widely utilized plants within traditional medicine, pharmaceuticals, and food industries. This study aims to delineate the diversity of root endophytic fungi associated with Glaucium fimbrilligerum, G. contortuplicatum, Chelidonium majus, Papaver macrostomum, P. chelidoniifolium, P. pavoninum, and P. rhoeas from Iran. Molecular identification involved amplification and sequencing of LSU (partial large subunit nrDNA), ITS (internal transcribed spacer), TEF-1 alpha (translation elongation factor), and TUB (beta-tubulin) genomic regions. A total of 32 isolates of endophytic fungi were identified. Approximately 96.87% of these fungi belonged to Ascomycota, with only Irpex laceratus isolated and identified from G. fimbrilligerum as Basidiomycota. Fusarium was the predominant genus, representing 34.37% of endophytic fungi, followed by Sarocladium, Alternaria, and Cladosporium at 18.75%, 9.375%, and 6.25%, respectively. F. proliferatum was found to colonize 71.42% of plants, including P. macrostomum, P. chelidoniifolium, P. pavoninum, P. rhoeas, and C. majus. The fungus isolate S. strictum was recovered from 42.85% of various plant species, including G. fimbrilligerum, G. contortuplicatum, and P. chelidoniifolium. Moreover, this investigation represents the inaugural documentation of endophytic behavior exhibited by the fungi A. japonica and S. implicatum within plant species, as no previous literature has reported such occurrences. Consequently, this study unveils novel insights into the population of endophytic fungi associated with seven medicinal plants belonging to the Papaveraceae family.

"Absence","Plant-microbe interactions are remarkably diverse and dynamic. These interactions can be in the form of endophytic association. Colonization of endophytic microflora in crop plants improves crop health leading to crop enhancement. They stimulate the overall growth of plants by facilitating nutrient uptake and regulating various hormones. This eventually improves the plant biomass and grain yield. Owing to the assistance of the endophytes to the host plants, augmentation of crop plants with potential fungal endophytes or their extracted bioactive compound can upsurge the overall crop production and provide promising solutions for environmentally sustainable agriculture. In this light, the present study deals with the prospects of bioactive metabolites produced by endophytic fungi in Albizia lebbeck (L.) Benth, a medicinal native plant of Rajasthan. The metabolomic analysis of a partially purified extract of Aspergillus niger (isolate 29) showed the presence of a total of 919 compounds using UHPLC-MS/MS. The metabolic pathway analysis revealed that these compounds were influencing super pathway of gibberellin and isoflavonoid biosynthesis. Significant increase in seed germination percentage (73-93%), seed vigour index (834.44-1498.21) and germination index (2.54-3.67 seeds/day) was found in treated seeds compared to untreated. There was a significant improvement in root (45-185%) and shoot length (215-295%) of wheat, barley and millet and a significant increase in root number (38-97%) in wheat and barley. Positive correlation was observed in the growth parameters of all the crops upon treatment. Overall, the results indicated that the partially purified fraction of A. niger (isolate 29) improved seed germination and promoted plant growth in cash crops. The results emphasize towards the importance of secondary metabolites in seed germination and enhancement of plant growth.

"Absence","Premise: Endophytic and mycorrhizal fungi are crucial in facilitating plant nutrition acquisition and stress tolerance. In epiphytic habitats, plants face nutrition and water stress, but their roots are mostly nonmycorrhizal and especially lacking in arbuscular mycorrhizal associations. Ophioderma pendulum is an epiphytic fern with a partially mycoheterotrophic lifestyle, likely heavily reliant on symbiotic fungi. To characterize fungal associations in the sporophyte of O. pendulum, we focused on leaves and roots of O. pendulum, seeking to reveal the fungal communities in these organs. Methods: Roots and leaves from O. pendulum in a subtropical forest were examined microscopically to observe the morphology of fungal structures and determine the percentage of various fungal structures in host tissues. Fungal composition was profiled using metabarcoding techniques that targeted ITS2 of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. Results: Roots were consistently colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycota), especially Acaulospora. Unlike previous findings on epiphytic ferns, dark septate endophytes were rare in O. pendulum roots. Leaves were predominantly colonized by Ascomycota fungi, specifically the classes Dothideomycetes (46.88%), Eurotiomycetes (11.51%), Sordariomycetes (6.23%), and Leotiomycetes (6.14%). Across sampling sites, fungal community compositions were similar in the roots but differed significantly in the leaves. Conclusions: Ophioderma pendulum maintains stable, single-taxon-dominant communities in the roots, primarily featuring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, whereas the leaves may harbor opportunistic fungal colonizers.

Dzf12, on growth and diosgenin production in plantlet or cell cultures of its host plant, Dioscorea zingiberensis. Methods: Palmarumycin C-13 was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of the endophytic fungus Berkleasmium sp. Dzf12 using a combination of high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC), Sephadex LH-20 chromatography and preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The biomass of the plantlet and cell cultures of D. zingiberensis as well as their diosgenin content and yield were analyzed after treatment with palmarumycin C-13. Results: Optimal elicitation of diosgenin production by palmarumycin C-13 in D. zingiberensis plantlet and cell cultures was achieved when palmarumycin C-13 was added to the medium at a concentration of 60 mg/L (for plantlet culture) at the beginning of culturing or 10 mg/L (for cell culture) on day 25 after inoculation. By using these optimal concentrations, the diosgenin yield of the cultured plantlets reached its maximum of 6.44 mg/L, that is, > 1.4-fold increase, while diosgenin yield of the cultured cells reached a maximum of 10.73 mg/L, which is an > 8.0-fold increase.

To achieve the symbiotic relationship, yeasts must colonize most parts of the plant tissues, including intercellular spaces, cytoplasm, stomata of seeds, roots, stems, leaves, and fruits as well. Conventionally, isolation of endophytic yeasts from different plant tissues and understanding their interior plants colonization mechanism have remainedkey strategies to exploit their key potentials. In this review, we will elaborate on the diversity, characteristics of colonization, and the factors that influence the distribution of endophytic yeasts. This review also lays a theoretical foundation for the application of endophytic yeasts in various industrial and agricultural practices.",6624,"A potentially important resource: endophytic yeasts","Ling, LJ; Tu, YX; Ma, WX; Feng, SL; Yang, CY; Zhao, YH; Wang, N; Li, ZB; Lu, L; Zhang, J",NA,NA,NA,"Ling, Lijun; Tu, Yixin; Ma, Wenxia; Feng, Shenglai; Yang, Caiyun; Zhao, Yunhua; Wang, Nan; Li, Zibin; Lu, Lu; Zhang, Ji",NA,NA,"WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ling, lijun/T-4595-2019","ling, lijun/0000-0002-8375-9076",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0959-3993","1573-0972",NA,NA,NA,"JUL 13",2020,"36","8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1007/s11274-020-02889-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-020-02889-0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32656593,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000552611400003",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6377,0.0968864666682225,0.903113533331777,"Uncertain","Uncertain",0.481012903518022,0.518987096481978,"Uncertain"
"Absence","Seed germination and seedling development in nearly all orchid species rely on a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi; however, this is not the case with all mycorrhizal fungi. This study aims to provide an understanding about the important role of mycorrhiza in seed germination and growth of Paphiopedilum barbigerum. Therefore, we isolated and identified endophytic fungi from the roots of wild P. barbigerum. The beneficial mycorrhizal fungi Epulorhiza sp. FQXY019 and Tulasnella calospora FQXY017 were screened by seed symbiotic germination tests and found to promote seed germination. However, only the seeds inoculated with FQXY019 progressed from the seed germination to rooting stage. This shows that mycorrhizal fungi and P. barbigerum have a specific relation at different growth phases. In addition, we selected FQXY019 and inoculated it into MS medium, B5 medium, OMA medium, and PDA medium. The results showed that FQXY019 co-cultured on PDA significantly promoted the increase in seedling fresh weight, leaf length, and root length (p < .01). Furthermore, it significantly promoted the root number and leaf number of seedlings compared with those co-cultured on MS, B5, and OMA media and control (p < .05). Thus, this study demonstrated the promoting effect of Epulorhiza sp. FQXY019 on seed germination and seedling development, making it an alternative method for the artificial propagation of P. barbigerum. © 2021 The Author(s).

"Absence","Since the first report on Camptothecin detection in Nothapodytes nimmoniana by Govindachari and Viswanathan (Phytochem 11: 35-29, 1972), considerable work has been done on biotechnology and its applications on the species. Plant tissue culture techniques have applications in clonal propagation, CPT production, and conservation of N. nimmoniana. Discovery of CPT production by endophytes existing in symbiotic association with N. nimmoniana has provided new insights into finding alternative sources of the alkaloid. Development of molecular markers such as RFLP, RAPD, ISSR, and AFLP has facilitated understanding of population ecology and genetics of the species. Molecular information generated from these studies is promising in establishing strategies for conservation and sustainable use of N. nimmoniana populations under overexploitation pressure. The advances in instrumentation in the 20th century, such as desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry allowed CPT analysis in tissues without sample pretreatment. Other ancient techniques for qualitative and quantitative analysis such as chromatography, spectroscopy, and H1-NMR are applied in the detection of CPT due to variable sensitivity to the alkaloid. The review covers work on plant tissue culture for clonal propagation and CPT production in N. nimmoniana. Besides symbiotic endophyte sources of CPT in N. nimmoniana, population genetics studies and instrumentation analysis of the alkaloids are reviewed.",6988,"Camptothecin from <i>Nothapodytes nimmoniana</i>: review on biotechnology applications","Isah, T; Mujib, A",NA,NA,NA,"Isah, Tasiu; Mujib, Abdul",NA,NA,"ACTA PHYSIOLOGIAE PLANTARUM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mujib, A./AAI-3179-2020; Isah, Tasiu/C-1252-2017","Isah, Tasiu/0000-0002-2112-530X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0137-5881","1861-1664",NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2015,"37","6",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1007/s11738-015-1854-3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11738-015-1854-3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000355703800002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6733,0.491491240581961,0.508508759418039,"Absence","Absence",0.000522763132333015,0.999477236867667,"Absence"
"Absence","Steroidal alkaloids, as the major biologically active components in Bulbus Fritillariae, possess a variety of toxicological and pharmacological effects on humans. The objective of this work was to determine whether endophytic fungi isolated from fresh bulbs of Fritillaria unibracteata var. wabensis can produce one or more alkaloids like its host plant. Four classical reagents including Wagner's, iodine-potassium iodide, Mayer's and improved Dragendorff's were used for primary screening. Then thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography-evaporative light scattering detection (HPLC-ELSD) were employed to identify the fermentation products of the selected strains. The results showed that extract from one stain (WBS007) has positive reactions in process of primary screening. A further TLC scan and HPLC-ELSD showed that strain WBS007 had two components with the same TLC relative front (RI) value and HPLC retention time (RT) as authentic peimisine and peiminine. In addition, strain WBS007 was identified as Fusarium sp. based on phylogenetic analysis of ITS sequences. Thus, strain WBS007 produced the bioactive ingredient peimisine and peiminine, as does its host plant, and could be used for the production of peimisine and peiminine by fermentation.

"Absence","Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni) is a salt-sensitive herb with sweet leaves without side effects for diabetic patients. The present research was conducted to investigate the effect of endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica and two bacterial isolates, namely of Streptomyces sp. (kj152148) and (kj152149) with Stevia host plants. These microbial isolates were utilized as growth-promoting agents for induction of salt stress tolerance and secondary metabolite accumulation in inoculated plants. The present experiment was designed as factorial basis experiment based on a completely randomized design with six replications undertaken in two consecutive years (2016-2017). Treatments included three levels of salinity [0.85 (control), 1.5 and 3 dS/m] and four levels of plant growth-promoting microorganisms [no-inoculation, Piriformospora indica, Kj152148 Streptomyces sp (S1) and K152149 Streptomyces sp (S2)]. Under stress and non-stress conditions, endophytic fungus and bacterial isolates had significant positive effect on the recorded biochemical and physiological parameters of stevia. Inoculation of fungus and bacterial isolates reduced the negative effects of salinity stress by increasing antioxidant enzymes and free radical scavenging activity, phenol and flavonoid accumulation and total glucose and proline concentrations. From the results it may be concluded that, indicated a positive effect of applied fungus and bacterial treatments on the resistance of stevia plant to the salinity stress and due to the relative susceptibility of stevia to salinity, pre-treatment of the plant using of the desired microbes is recommended before planting in soil areas susceptible to salinity.

"Absence","The Aizoaceae, commonly known as mesembs or ""ice plants"", is a plant family endemic to Namaqualand, an area inside the Succulent Karoo biodiversity hotspot in South Africa. The more than 1800 unique mesembs are in part characterised by their hygrochastic seed capsules dispersing their seed by jet action. Six capsule types: Mesembryanthemum-, Delosperma-, Drosanthemum-, Lampranthus-, Ruschia- and Leipoldtia-type are distinguished by differences in funicles, covering membranes and closing bodies. With the existence of microbial endemism, now widely recognised, research into community ecology in the Succulent Karoo is needed to enable proper conservation. Sadly the microbial life associated with Aizoaceae has received little attention, Alternaria, Colletotrichum and Fusarium, have however been isolated from the halophyte Sesuvium portulacastrum, one of the few species from Aizoaceae but not endemic to South Africa. Fungi are known to aid in germination, seedling establishment, growth, water relations and nutrition in the Cactaceae (a family closely related to Aizoaceae). We believe that fungi may play a role in the ability of Aizoaceae to thrive in Namaqualand due to their specialization in the form of thick-walled spores that remain viable and have the ability to grow slow even at extreme aridity. We have isolated species of Alternaria, Aspergillus, Bipolaris, Cladosporium, Fusarium and Talaromyces from seeds of common mesemb species from Namaqualand. This is the first report of fungi associating with the specialised propagative material of Aizoaceae.",7424,"Fungi associated with <i>Aizoaceae</i> seed in the Succulent Karoo","Pieterse, Z; Aveling, TAS; Jacobs, A",NA,"Soundy, P; Slabbert, R; Kleynhans, R",NA,"Pieterse, Z.; Aveling, T.

"Absence","The aims of this study were to examine the effect of Pb2+ stress on the primary reaction of photosynthesis and to assess the potential benefits of endophytic infection on the Pb2+ tolerance of rice seedlings. Rice inoculated with an endophytic fungus (E+) and non-inoculated (E-) were subjected to 0, 50, 100, 150 and 200μM Pb2+. The responses to Pb2+ stress were characterized by the analysis of Chl a fluorescence. A comparison of E- with E+ rice seedlings, as evaluated by their performance index (PIABS and PItot), revealed the inhibitory effects of Pb2+ on photosystem II (PSII) connectivity, the oxygen evolving complex (OEC), and on the J step of the induction curves, which is associated with an inhibition of electron transport from the quinone acceptor QA to QB. Furthermore, the changes of the donor and the acceptor parameters of PSII were greater in E- than in E+ under Pb2+ stress. These observations suggest that the efficiency and stability of PSII are markedly affected by Pb2+ stress, and the photosynthetic energy conservation in E+ was more effective than in E- We showed that endophytic infection plays an important role in enhancing the photosynthetic mechanism of rice seedlings exposed to Pb2+ stress. © 2015 .",7527,"Endophytic infection alleviates Pb2+ stress effects on photosystem II functioning of Oryza sativa leaves","Li X.; Zhang L.",NA,"",NA,"Li, Xuemei (55718129600); Zhang, Lihong (55709291400)",NA,NA,"Journal of Hazardous Materials",NA,NA,"English","","","","",NA,"Chlorophyll fluorescence; Endophytic infection; Pb<sup>2+</sup> stress; Photosystem II","Chlorophyll; Endophytes; Lead; Oryza; Photosynthesis; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Plant Leaves; Stress, Physiological; Fungi; Oryza sativa; Electron transport properties; chlorophyll a; lead; oxygen; chlorophyll; lead; photosystem II; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Electron transport; Endophytic infection; Oxygen-evolving complexes; Performance indices; Photosystem II; Potential benefits; Quinone acceptors; chlorophyll a; endophyte; fungal disease; fungus; inhibition; inoculation; lead; leaf; oxygen; photosynthesis; rice; seedling; Article; chemical stress; controlled study; electron transport; endophyte; energy conservation; environmental stress; fluorescence analysis; nonhuman; oxygen evolving complex; photosynthesis; photosystem II; physical tolerance; plant leaf; plant microorganism interaction; plant stress; rice; seedling; drug effects; endophyte; metabolism; microbiology; Oryza; photosystem II; physiological stress; physiology; plant leaf; Fluorescence","College of Chemistry and Life Science, Shenyang Normal University, Shenyang, 110034, China; Environmental Science Department of Liaoning University, Shenyang, 110036, China","Li X., College of Chemistry and Life Science, Shenyang Normal University, Shenyang, 110034, China; Zhang L., Environmental Science Department of Liaoning University, Shenyang, 110036, China","",NA,NA,NA,"Director Foundation of Eco-Environmental Research Center at Shenyang Normal University, (EERC-K-201302); National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC, (31270369, 31470398)",NA,"This research was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 31270369 , 31470398 ), and the Director Foundation of Eco-Environmental Research Center at Shenyang Normal University ( EERC-K-201302 ).","Gundel P.E., Garibaldi L.A., Martinez-Ghersa M.A., Ghersa C.M., Neotyphodium endophyte transmission to Lolium multiflorum seeds depends on the host plant fitness, Environ.

The different species of this genus can control different arthropod pests like sweetpotato whitefly, sugarcane woolly aphid, two-spotted mite, cotton aphid, cotton leaf worm, red spider mite, armyworm; and different plant diseases like- rice blast, wheat stripe rust, chrysanthemum white rust, etc. Chemical pesticides are a common practice by the user to protect their crops from these pests. But the intensive use of chemical pesticides has harmful impacts on human health and ecosystem functioning, and they also reduce plant protection sustainability. Sustainable plant protection could be achieved through the reduction of chemical pesticides, resulting in minimal impact on the environment without compromising crop yields. This review was written based on biocontrol methods using Cladosporium sp. which is an alternative option for pest management.

However, compared to E-group, the increases in the activities of GR, and APX, and the contents of Pro, TASC, TGSH and GSH result in the decreases in the contents of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), O2- and MDA, and the increases in plant height and aboveground dry weight in E+ group.

"Absence","The obligately symbiotic group of fungi, the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi possess several characteristics that make identification, and therefore ecological field studies, difficult. A major limitation is that this group cannot be grown in pure culture. Traditional methods of identifying this group rely on the isolation of asexual spores from the soil. These spores, which are resting structures, do not necessarily reflect what species is actively colonizing the plant root. We have recently utilized molecular methods to develop a protocol for identifying AM fungi. Field collected spores were identified using traditional microscopy, and the DNA extracted for amplification. A DNA extraction method using crude lysate was developed which eliminates the need for a large amount of tissue and produces a DNA template suitable for PCR amplification. Results indicate that size polymorphisms in the ITS region of rDNA can distinguish between genera, and can be used to screen species. Amplification products of field collected Artemisia californica roots showed that these fungal endophytes may be identified to species based on size polymorphisms.",8279,"Identification of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi from Artemisia californica using the polymerase chain reaction","Harney, SK; Edwards, FS; Allen, MF",NA,NA,NA,"Harney, SK; Edwards, FS; Allen, MF",NA,NA,"MYCOLOGIA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0027-5514",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JUL-AUG",1997,"89","4",NA,NA,NA,"547","550","10.2307/3760989","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3760989",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1997XQ30800004",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7992,0.0144205793841462,0.985579420615854,"Absence","Absence",0.12688272291542,0.87311727708458,"Uncertain"

The abilities of the fungus to solubilize different sources of phosphorus (P) [AlPO4, FePO4 and Ca-3(PO4)(2)] and to produce indole acetic acid (IAA) were also determined. C geniculatainoculated pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) plants exhibited superior growth over uninoculated control plants and the fungus solubilized different sources of P in the order of FePO4>AlPO4>Ca-3(PO4)(2). The pH of the culture medium, fungal biomass production and acid phosphatase activity was significantly influenced by phosphate source and incubation period. IAA production, confirmed by chromatographic analysis, increased with increasing concentrations of tryptophan in a non-linear manner. It can be concluded from the results that C. geniculata mediates plant growth through phosphate solubilization and phytohormone production.

"Absence","The potential for endophytes to initiate changes in host secondary metabolism has been well documented. However, the mechanisms underlying endophyte-plant metabolic interactions are still poorly understood. Here, we analysed the effects of fungal endophytes on the metabolite profiles of grape cells from two cultivars: 'Cabernet Sauvignon' (CS) and 'Rose honey' (RH). Our results clearly showed that co-culture with endophytic fungi greatly modified the metabolic profiles in grape cells of both varieties. Treatments with endophytic fungal strains caused the numbers of detected metabolites to vary from 10 to 19 in CS cells and from 8 to 14 in RH cells. In addition, 5 metabolites were detected in all CS cell samples, while 4 metabolites were detected in all RH cell samples. Some endophytic fungal strains could even introduce novel metabolites into the co-cultured grape cells. The metabolic profiles of grape leaves shaped by endophytic fungi exhibited host selectivity and fungal strain specificity. In this assay, the fungal strains RH32 (Alternaria sp.) and MDR36 (Colletotrichum sp.) triggered an increased response of the detected metabolites, including the greatest increase in the metabolite contents in grape cells of both cultivars. No obvious effects in terms of metabolite numbers and contents in grape cells when co-cultured with fungal strains RH7 (Epicoccum sp.) and RH48 (Colletotrichum sp.) were observed. The results of this experiment suggest that endophytic fungi could be used to control the metabolic profiles of grapes and thus increase grape quality.",8354,"Diverse and strain-specific metabolites patterns induced by fungal endophytes in grape cells of different varieties","Pan, XX; Yuan, MQ; Chen, JC; Yu, M; Qu, JZ; Liu, F; Xiang, SY; Zhu, YY; Yang, MZ",NA,NA,NA,"Pan, Xiao-Xia; Yuan, Ming-Quan; Chen, Jing-Chao; Yu, Man; Qu, Jin-Zhuo; Liu, Fang; Xiang, Si-Yu; Zhu, You-Yong; Yang, Ming-Zhi",NA,NA,"VITIS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0042-7500",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2020,"59","4",NA,NA,NA,"155","162","10.5073/vitis.2020.59.155-162","http://dx.doi.org/10.5073/vitis.2020.59.155-162",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000611972800003",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8065,0.110471591196428,0.889528408803572,"Absence","Uncertain",0.391890084392996,0.608109915607004,"Uncertain"

"Absence","The purpose of our study was to determine whether the application of quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) and pyrazole-carboxamide fungicides as a tank mix would impact the endophyte community of soybean seed. Field trials during 2018 in Iowa, South Dakota, and Wisconsin, U.S.A., investigated the impact of a single combination fungicide spray at early pod set in soybeans. The composition of culturable endophytic fungi in mature soybean seed was assessed on three cultivars per state, with maturity groups (MGs) ranging from 1.1 to 4.7. An unusually wet 2018 season delayed harvest, which led to a high level of fungal growth in grain. The survey included 1,080 asymptomatic seeds that were disinfested and individually placed on 5-cm-diameter Petri plates of acidified water agar. The survey yielded 721 fungal isolates belonging to 24 putative species in seven genera; taxa were grouped into genera based on a combination of morphological and molecular evidence. The dominant genera encountered in the survey were Alternaria, Diaporthe, and Fusarium. The study showed that the fungicide treatment reduced the incidence of Fusarium in Wisconsin seed, increased the incidence of Diaporthe in seed from all states, and had no impact on the incidence of Alternaria. This is one of the first attempts to characterize the diversity of seed endophytes in soybean and the first to characterize the impacts of fungicide spraying on these endophyte communities across three states.

"Absence","The threat to public health resulting from the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is ever rising. One of the major bacterial pathogens at the forefront of this problem is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, for which there is a great need to find alternative treatments. One of the most promising alternatives is endophytic fungi, which were shown to produce a vast array of bioactive compounds, including many novel antibacterial compounds. In this study, two endophytic Alternaria sp., EL 24 and EL 35, were identified from the leaves of Eremophila longifolia. Ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extracts of their culture filtrates were found to inhibit both methicillin-sensitive S. aureus ATCC 25923 and MRSA strains M173525 and M180920. The activity of each extract was shown to be greatly affected by the growth medium, with considerable reductions in minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) observed when tested in tryptic soy broth with glucose (TSBG) compared with Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB). Both extracts displayed significant (p <= 0.05) antibiofilm activity against all three S. aureus strains, the greatest of which was that of EL 35, which reduced biofilm formation by M180920 by 72%, while that of EL 24 resulted in a 57% reduction against ATCC 25923. Both extracts also disrupted established biofilms, of which the most effective was EL 35, which reduced the M180920 biofilm by 64%, while EL 24 also performed best against M180920, reducing biofilm by 54%. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the EL 24 EtOAc extract revealed five known compounds. This study highlights the promise of endophytic fungi from Australian plants as a potential source of substances effective against important bacterial pathogens. Further understanding of the responsible compounds and their mechanisms could lead to the development of treatments effective against MRSA, as well as novel biofilm-resistant biomedical materials, contributing towards reducing the burden of AMR.",8645,"Antibacterial and Antibiofilm Activity of Endophytic <i>Alternaria</i> sp.

"Absence","This review focuses on a rare group of steroids and triterpenoids that share common properties as regulators of lipid metabolism. This group of compounds is divided by the type of chemical structure, and they represent: aromatic steroids, steroid phosphate esters, highly oxygenated steroids such as steroid endoperoxides and hydroperoxides, alpha,beta-epoxy steroids, and secosteroids. In addition, subgroups of carbon-bridged steroids, neo steroids, miscellaneous steroids, as well as synthetic steroids containing heteroatoms S (epithio steroids), Se (selena steroids), Te (tellura steroids), and At (astatosteroids) were presented. Natural steroids and triterpenoids have been found and identified from various sources such as marine sponges, soft corals, starfish, and other marine invertebrates. In addition, this group of rare lipids is found in fungi, fungal endophytes, and plants. The pharmacological profile of the presented steroids and triterpenoids was determined using the well-known computer program PASS, which is currently available online for all interested scientists and pharmacologists and is currently used by research teams from more than 130 countries of the world. Our attention has been focused on the biological activities of steroids and triterpenoids associated with the regulation of cholesterol metabolism and related processes such as anti-hyperlipoproteinemic activity, as well as the treatment of atherosclerosis, lipoprotein disorders, or inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis. In addition, individual steroids and triterpenoids were identified that demonstrated rare or unique biological activities such as treating neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's diseases with a high degree of certainty over 95 percent. For individual steroids or triterpenoids or a group of compounds, 3D drawings of their predicted biological activities are presented.",8846,"In Silico Prediction of Steroids and Triterpenoids as Potential Regulators of Lipid Metabolism","Dembitsky, VM",NA,"",NA,"Dembitsky, Valery M.",NA,NA,"MARINE DRUGS",NA,NA,"English","","","","",NA,"Activity; Hormones; Lipid metabolism; Regulators; Steroids; Triterpenoids","Animals; Anthozoa; Aquatic Organisms; Lipid Metabolism; Porifera; Starfish; Steroids; Triterpenes; aromatic steroid; astatosteroid; epithio steroid; epoxy steroid; hydroperoxy steroid; neo steroid; peroxy steroid; secosteroid; selena steroid; soft coral steroid; steroid; steroid endoperoxide; steroid phosphate ester; tellura steroid; triterpenoid; unclassified drug; steroid; triterpene; biological activity; cell proliferation; cholesterol synthesis; computer model; drug mechanism; drug structure; human; hypocholesterolemic activity; lipid metabolism; liver protection; nonhuman; Review; animal; Anthozoa; aquatic species; chemistry; drug effect; lipid metabolism; sponge (Porifera); starfish","Centre for Applied Research, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Lethbridge College, 3000 College Drive South, Lethbridge, T1K 1L6, AB, Canada","Dembitsky V.M., Centre for Applied Research, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Lethbridge College, 3000 College Drive South, Lethbridge, T1K 1L6, AB, Canada","V.M.

"Absence","To determine the identity and diversity of endophytic fungi associated with the liana from five different forest localities of Jhargram and West Medinipur districts of West Bengal. On the basis of differentiation of weather and microclimate, I have to select the regions. Between the two regions, the distance is at least 25-30 km, the microclimate and moisture under the canopy will differ, it affects mainly on the presence of endophytes. Leaf, fruit and stem segments were collected randomly in summer, winter and monsoon in 2018. It is impossible to take all leaves and other organs of a plant because plant parts should be collected sustainably so that minimum damage of stock occurs. Surfaces of all samples were sterilised just before putting on pot5ato dextrose agar (PDA) media for the growth of endophytic fungal mycelia and their isolation. Fungi were isolated and identified based on the morphology of its colony, and mycelial form and morphology, sexual and asexual reproductive structures and their characters, spore-form and nature of attachment, cultural conditions etc. were taken in consideration to identify them. Total 1125 samples were used for endophytic growth. The total of 1558 endophytic fungi were isolated from 797 sample segments of Celastrus paniculatus. The dominant endophytic fungi belong to genera Fusarium sp., Aspergillus sp., Chaetomium sp., Beltrania sp., Pestalotiopsis sp., Verticillium sp., Arthrinium sp, Penicillium sp., Podospora sp., Alternarium sp., Acrocylindrium sp. etc. Maximum endophytic isolates were obtained from leaf segments followed by fruit and then stem. In monsoon, colonization frequency shows highest (80.53%) and in summer, it is lowest (61.87%) from the plant samples of all locations. The examples from Chilkigarh shows the highest colonization frequency (90.22%) and from Nayagram, it is the lowest (61.78%). The leaf's colonization frequency is maximum (84.53%) and the stem is minimum (62.4%). Most of the isolated endophytic fungi were found under the group Deuteromycetes. Endophytic fungi show a wide range of Shannon-Weiner and Simpson's indices. These indicators point to an equal and throughout distribution of different species. The findings add to our knowledge of the identity and diversity of endophytic fungi, which are expected to have a variety of interactions with their host plants. © Copyright by International Academic Publishing House (IAPH)",9103,"Diversity of Endophytic fungi in liana, Celastrus paniculatus collected from few sites of Jhargram and Paschim Medinipur districts, West Bengal, India","Bagchi B.; Saradar B.",NA,"",NA,"Bagchi, Biplab (57205505574); Saradar, Binod (57244318300)",NA,NA,"International Journal of Experimental Research and Review",NA,NA,"English","","","","",NA,"Celastrus sp; diversity; endophytic fungi; lianas; sacred grooves","","Department of Botany, Bangabasi College, West Bengal, Kolkata, 700009, India; Department of Botany, University of Calcutta, W.B., Kolkata, 700073, India","Bagchi B., Department of Botany, Bangabasi College, West Bengal, Kolkata, 700009, India; Saradar B., Department of Botany, University of Calcutta, W.B., Kolkata, 700073, India","B.

"Absence","To explore the species diversity and ecological functions of endophytic fungi in the roots of Rhododendron simsii Planch under Finns massoniana forests in central Guizhou, the hairy roots of R. simsii under P. massoniana forests in Wudang (WD), Mengguan (MG) and Longli (LL) areas were collected. DNA of endophytic fungi in the roots was extracted for high throughput sequencing. Alpha was used to analyze the species diversity of fungi. FUN Guild annotation platform was used to analyze the ecological function categories of fungi and explore the core microbial groups in fungal communities.The network graph was used to show the correlation between fungal flora. The results showed that the species diversity of endophytic fungi in the roots of Rhododendron was rich in three regions. The diversity and richness of endophytic fungi of Rhododendron in WD area was the highest. A total of 425799 valid sequences and 817 operational classification units (OTU) were obtained, belonging to 6 phylas, 19 classes, 52 orders, 103 families, and 154 genera. They mainly belong to Ascomycota (81.2%) , Zygomycota (5.8%) , and Basidiomycota (4.7%). The dominant class, order, and family of them were Eurotiomycetes (43.0%) , Eurotiales (39.2%) , and Trichocomaceae (39.2%) , respectively. At the genus level, PeniciUium accounted for the highest proportion (38.60%), followed by Trichoderma (7.20%) and Pestalotiopsis which constituted 6.10%. The fungi in the root had a variety of ecological functional groups, such as Undefined Saprotroph ( 194 OTU) , Plant Pathogen (20 OTU) , Soil Saprotroph ( 18 OTU) , Ectomycorrhizal fungi ( 14 OTU) , Lichenized fungi (10 OTU) , Ericoid Mycorrhizal fungi (5 OTU) , Wood Saprotroph (5 OTU) , Arbuscular Mycorrhizal fungi (4 OTU) , Endophyte (2 OTU), Animal Pathogen (8 OTU), and 21 kinds of mixed nutritional groups, in which 102 undefined species had no reference in the FUNGuild database. The endophytic fungi in the root can form niche sharing model and have coupling among different functional groups.
