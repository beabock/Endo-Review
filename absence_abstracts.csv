"Absence","1. Plants have developed a variety of defence strategies against herbivores. One possible strategy is the induced production of metabolites following herbivore attack. Plant-associated micro-organisms can be the source of such defensive compounds. For example, cool-season grasses can be associated with systemic endophytic fungi of the genus Epichloe, which produce herbivore-toxic alkaloids. 2. In a controlled common garden approach, we tested the hypothesis that different types of herbivory induce endophyte growth and increase the endophyte-mediated production of three bioactive alkaloids which can deter or toxify herbivores. During 18 weeks, we analysed biweekly endophyte and alkaloid concentrations in the grass Lolium perenne infected with the endophytic fungus Epichloe festucae var. lolii. The experiment was conducted throughout the field season and compared three different herbivore treatments to the control treatment (herbivory exclosure). 3. We showed that the concentration of the vertebrate toxic alkaloid lolitrem B increased following clipping (a simulation of grazing herbivores), while the insect deterring alkaloid peramine increased following locust herbivory (biting-chewing herbivores). The endophyte concentration increased slightly following clipping (P = 0.09). Sap sucking aphids altered neither endophyte nor alkaloid concentrations. 4. Our study provides evidence for an herbivore-specific induction of endophyte-mediated responses following herbivore attack on its host grass. Our results suggest that the grass-endophyte symbiosis involves a close chemical crosstalk between the interacting partners.",58,"Herbivore-specific induction of defence metabolites in a grass-endophyte association","Fuchs, B; Krischke, M; Mueller, MJ; Krauss, J",NA,NA,NA,"Fuchs, Benjamin; Krischke, Markus; Mueller, Martin J.; Krauss, Jochen",NA,NA,"FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mueller, martin/C-7616-2019; Fuchs, Benjamin/X-2095-2019; Krauss, Jochen/C-6216-2014","Fuchs, Benjamin/0000-0002-3678-3284; Krauss, Jochen/0000-0003-2304-9117",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0269-8463","1365-2435",NA,NA,NA,"FEB",2017,"31","2",NA,NA,NA,"318","324","10.1111/1365-2435.12755","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12755",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000394374100005",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,57,0.0115050904562544,0.988494909543746,"Absence","Absence",0.113101705371839,0.886898294628161,"Uncertain"
"Absence","16 endophytic strains of fungi were isolated from roots, stems and leaves of two different origins of Arundina graminifolia using classical endophyte isolation method during an interesting investigation on the culturable endophyte communities and diversities of Arundina graminifolia grown in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan province and Baise, Guangxi province. Among them, Four endophytic fungi were isolated from Arundina graminifolia grown in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan province, and 12 endophytic fungi were isolated from Arundina graminifolia grown in Baise, Guangxi province. According to the morphological observation and ITS gene sequence homology analysis, they were divided into 7 categories, including Phanerochaete sp., Phyllosticta capitalensis, Diaporthe sp., Hypoxylon sp., Nodullsporium sp., Chaetomium nigricolor, and the other 10 strains belonging to Colletotrichum sp., indicating that Colletotrichum sp. was a dominant species of endophytic fungi. Two kinds of strains BSSF-2 and YNLF-1 (DPPH free radicals scavenging rate ≥80%) with strong antioxidant activity were obtained by measuring the antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging assay, the reducing ability of Fe3+ and H2O2 radical scavenging assay) of 5 endophytic fungi (i.e., YNLF-1, BSSF-2, BSRF-1, BSRF-2 and BSRF-3). The strain BSSF-2 was identified as Colletotrichum karstii, the strain YNLF-1 was Phanerochaete sp. The results of this study showed that the endophytic fungi of medicinal plants had broad prospects for the development of antioxidant drugs. © 2018, Editorial Board of Modern Food Science and Technology.

"Absence","A new compound, (6R,7S,2E,4E)-6,7-dihydroxy-4,6-dimethylocta-2,4-dienoic acid (1), together with eight known compounds were isolated from the co-culture of Saccharicola sp. and Botryosphaeria parva, an endophytic fungi associated with Eugenia jambolana Lam. (Myrtaceae) plant species. The structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis of the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) data as well as by comparison with literature data.

The finding of these fungi in both normal and galled flowers was taken as an indication that they do not have a definite relationship with the midges. Moreover, identification based on DNA sequencing showed that these isolates are taxonomically heterogeneous and belong to several species which are classified in two different species complexes. Two new species, Cladosporium polonicum and Cladosporium neapolitanum, were characterized within the Cladosporium cladosporioides species complex based on strains from Poland and Italy, respectively.

Among the 10 different fungal strains isolated, one potent strain with broad-spectrum antagonistic activity was found. Basing on the morphological, cultural and molecular characteristics, the potent fungal strain was identified as Cladosporium cladosporioides. Production of bioactive metabolites by the strain was high in Malt Extract Broth compared to other media tested. The culture utilized Mannitol and Beef extract as good carbon and Nitrogen sources for the elaboration of bioactive metabolites. The optimum pH and Temperature for bioactive metabolite production of the strain were recorded at 4.0 and 30 degrees C. The secondary metabolites produced by the strain grown under optimal conditions exhibited high antagonistic activity against gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria and fungi.

"Absence","Alternaria alternata that threatens pepper production and causes major economic harm is responsible for the leaf spot/blight disease. Chemical fungicides have been widely employed; unfortunately, fungicidal resistance is a current concern. Therefore, finding new environmentally friendly biocontrol agents is a future challenge. One of these friendly solutions is the use of bacterial endophytes that have been identified as a source of bioactive compounds. The current study investigates the in vivo and in vitro fungicidal potential of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens RaSh1 (MZ945930) against pathogenic A. alternata. In vitro, the results revealed that RaSh1 exhibited strong antagonistic activity against A. alternata. In addition to this, we inoculated pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) plants with B. amyloliquefaciens RaSh1 and infected them with A. alternata. As a result of A. alternata infection, which generated the highest leaf spot disease incidence (DI), the plant's growth indices and physio-biochemical characteristics significantly decreased, according to our findings. Our results also showed the abnormal and deformed cell structure using light and electron microscopy of A. alternata-infected leaves compared with other treatments. However, DI was greatly reduced with B. amyloliquefaciens RaSh1 application (40%) compared to pepper plants infected with A. alternata (80%), and this led to the largest increases in all identified physio-biochemical parameters, including the activity of the defense-related enzymes. Moreover, inoculation of pepper plants with B. amyloliquefaciens RaSh1 decreased electrolyte leakage by 19.53% and MDA content by 38.60% as compared to A. alternata infected ones. Our results show that the endophyte B. amyloliquefaciens RaSh1 has excellent potential as a biocontrol agent and positively affects pepper plant growth. © 2023, The Author(s).",669,"In vivo and In vitro evaluation of the antifungal activity of the PGPR Bacillus amyloliquefaciens RaSh1 (MZ945930) against Alternaria alternata with growth promotion influences on Capsicum annuum L. plants","Soliman S.A.; Abdelhameed R.E.; Metwally R.A.",NA,"",NA,"Soliman, Shereen A.

"Absence","Alternaria species isolated from different econiches produce a wide variety of biologically active metabolites. The aim of this article was the evaluation of the biological activity spectrum of the small-spored Alternaria species from different trophic groups (saprophytes, endophytes and plant pathogens) using screening of biologically active metabolites on a wide set of test organisms, and selection of promising strains-producers. Methods. Antibiotic, antifungal and phytotoxic activities of culture filtrates and chloroform extracts were determined by agar diffusion assay method. Results. 19% of cultural filtrates among of 64 studied strains showed the biological activity at least against one test organism. The most of these fungi belong to endophytic strains and were active against test plant pathogenic fungi, bacteria and algae. Chloroform extracts of cultural filtrates of 33% of fungi showed biological activity against at least to one test organism. The obtained extracts had specific activity mainly against certain test culture. These preparations selectively inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus B-909, Chlorella vulgaris 191 and Rizoctonia solani 16036. Conclusions. The screening of 64 strains of the Alternaria fungi isolated from different ecological niches allows concluding that they have low biological activity. Endophytic Alternaria strains were characterized by wider spectrum of activities than plant pathogenic and soil ones. They inhibited all test organisms except Gram negative bacteria and yeast-like fungi. The biologically active metabolites of endophytic Alternaria strains including high-molecular compounds play important role in mutual coexistence endophytic fungi and host-plants as well as their spread. Chloroform extracts of the soil saprophytes had comparably high activity especially against fungi and algae. Obviously these low-molecular compounds facilitate to adaptive survival of saprophytic fungi in soil habitats with high biodiversity. For further studies were selected two strains: highly phytotoxic A. brassicicola 2855 and A. longipes 16800 (an antagonist of S. aureus B-909). © 2018, Zabolotny Institute of Microbiology and Virology, NAS of Ukraine.

"Absence","Although dark septate fungal endophytes (DSE) occur widely in association with plant roots in cold-stressed habitats, little is known of the taxonomic status of DSE in Antarctica. Here we investigate the phylogenetic affinities of DSE colonising the roots of Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica, the two maritime Antarctic vascular plant species. Two hundred and forty-three DSE were isolated from roots collected from 17 sites across a 1470 km transect through maritime and sub-Antarctica. The ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 nuclear ribosomal gene cluster of representative isolates was sequenced, and the sequences were recovered in 10 sequence groups and sub-groups. Nine of the sequence groupings could be placed in the Helotiales and the remaining one showed high homology to a large number of currently unassigned anamorphic ascomycete sequences. Of the Helotiales, Leptodontidium orchidicola, Rhizoscyphus ericae and species of Tapesia and Mollisia could be confidently identified. This study demonstrates that members of the Helotiales, including several widely-recognised DSE genera, commonly colonise the roots of C. quitensis and D. antarctica in the Antarctic.

"Absence","Although roots of species in the Pinaceae are usually colonized by ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi, there are increasing reports of the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungi in these species. The objective of this study was to determine the colonization patterns in seedlings of three Pinus (pine) species (Pinus banksiana, Pinus strobus, Pinus contorta) and Picea glauca x Picea engelmannii (hybrid spruce) grown in soil collected from a disturbed forest site. Seedlings of all three pine species and hybrid spruce became colonized by EM, AM, and DSE fungi. The dominant EM morphotype belonged to the E-strain category; limited colonization by a Tuber sp. was found on roots of Pinus strobus and an unknown morphotype (cf. Suillus-Rhizopogon group) with thick, cottony white mycelium was present on short roots of all species. The three fungal categories tended to occupy different niches in a single root system. No correlation was found between the percent root colonized by EM and percent colonization by either AM or DSE, although there was a positive correlation between percent root length colonized by AM and DSE. Hyphae and vesicles were the only AM intracellular structures found in roots of all species; arbuscules were not observed in any roots. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",701,"The co-occurrence of ectomycorrhizal, arbuscular mycorrhizal, and dark septate fungi in seedlings of four members of the Pinaceae","Wagg C.; Pautler M.; Massicotte H.B.; Peterson R.L.",NA,"",NA,"Wagg, Cameron (14057199100); Pautler, Michael (23098470300); Massicotte, Hugues B.

"Absence","Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are widespread soil endophytic fungi, forming mutualistic relationships with the vast majority of land plants. Biochar (BC) has been reported to improve soil fertility and promote plant growth. However, limited studies are available concerning the combined effects of AMF and BC on soil community structure and plant growth. In this work, a pot experiment was designed to investigate the effects of AMF and BC on the rhizosphere microbial community of Allium fistulosum L. Using Illumina high-throughput sequencing, we showed that inoculation of AMF and BC had a significant impact on soil microbial community composition, diversity, and versatility. Increases were observed in both plant growth (the plant height by 8.6%, shoot fresh weight by 12.1%) and root morphological traits (average diameter by 20.5%). The phylogenetic tree also showed differences in the fungal community composition in A. fistulosum. In addition, Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) analysis revealed that 16 biomarkers were detected in the control (CK) and AMF treatment, while only 3 were detected in the AMF + BC treatment. Molecular ecological network analysis showed that the AMF + BC treatment group had a more complex network of fungal communities, as evidenced by higher average connectivity. The functional composition spectrum showed significant differences in the functional distribution of soil microbial communities among different fungal genera. The structural equation model (SEM) confirmed that AMF could improve the microbial multifunctionality by regulating the rhizosphere fungal diversity and soil properties. Our findings provide new information on the effects of AMF and biochar on plants and soil microbial communities.",928,"Combined Application Effects of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi and Biochar on the Rhizosphere Fungal Community of <i>Allium fistulosum</i> L.","Ji, CX; Li, YY; Xiao, QC; Li, ZS; Wang, BY; Geng, XW; Lin, KQ; Zhang, Q; Jin, Y; Zhai, YQ; Li, XY; Chen, J",NA,NA,NA,"Ji, Chunxiang; Li, Yingyue; Xiao, Qingchen; Li, Zishan; Wang, Boyan; Geng, Xiaowan; Lin, Keqing; Zhang, Qing; Jin, Yuan; Zhai, Yuqian; Li, Xiaoyu; Chen, Jin",NA,NA,"JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Chen, Jin/GXW-0100-2022","Chen, Jin/0000-0002-0123-5093",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1017-7825","1738-8872",NA,NA,NA,"AUG",2023,"33","8",NA,NA,NA,"1013","1022","10.4014/jmb.2303.03026","http://dx.doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2303.03026",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37435864,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001162377600004",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,901,0.0245324507051135,0.975467549294887,"Absence","Uncertain",0.304781742714742,0.695218257285258,"Uncertain"

"Absence","Background Symbiotic associations of endophytic fungi have been proved by possessing an ability to produce hormones and metabolites for their host plant. Members of the Orchidaceae are obligate mycorrhizal species but a non-mycorrhizal association needs more investigation for their ability to promote plant growth and produce plant growth hormones. In the present study, endophytic fungi were isolated from the roots of Dendrobium longicornu Lindl., to investigate the root colonizing activity and role in plant growth and development. Results Among 23 fungal isolates were identified both by morphological and molecular technique as Penicillium sp., Fusarium sp., Coniochaeta sp., Alternaria sp., and Cladosporium sp. The dominate species were Coniochaeta sp. and Cladosporium sp. The dominant species as per the isolation was Coniochaeta sp. These fungal strains were screened for growth-promoting activity of Cymbidium aloifolium (plantlet) consider as cross genus interaction and Dendrobium longicornu (protocorms) as a host plant in in-vitro condition. Importantly, Cladosporium sp., and Coniochaeta sp. showed successful colonization and peloton formation with roots of C. aloifolium. Moreover, it also enhanced acclimatization of plantlets. Fungal elicitors from nine fungal isolates enhanced the growth of the in vitro grown protocorms of D. longicornu. Key bioactive compounds detected in the fungal colonized plant extract were 2H-pyran-2-one, Cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, Oleic Acid and d-Mannitol, which may have a potential role in plant-microbe interaction. All fungal endophytes were able to synthesize the indole acetic acid (IAA) in presence of tryptophan. Moreover, fungal extract DLCCR7 treated with DL-tryptophan yielded a greater IAA concentration of 43 mu g per ml than the other extracts. The iaaM gene involved in IAA synthesis pathway was amplified using iaaM gene primers successfully from Alternaria sp., Cladosporium sp., and Coniochaeta sp. Conclusions Hence, this study confirms the production of IAA by endophytes and demonstrated their host as well as cross-genus plant growth-promoting potential by producing metabolites required for the growth of the plant.",1124,"Colonization with non-mycorrhizal culturable endophytic fungi enhances orchid growth and indole acetic acid production","Shah, S; Shah, B; Sharma, R; Rekadwad, B; Shouche, YS; Sharma, J; Pant, B",NA,NA,NA,"Shah, Sujit; Shah, Biva; Sharma, Rohit; Rekadwad, Bhagwan; Shouche, Yogesh S.; Sharma, Jyotsna; Pant, Bijaya",NA,NA,"BMC MICROBIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"shah, sujit/ACS-0932-2022; SHARMA, ROHIT/JOZ-6961-2023; Rekadwad, Bhagwan/A-1752-2011","Sharma, Rohit/0000-0001-9351-0525; Shah, Sujit/0000-0002-6175-5242",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1471-2180",NA,NA,NA,NA,"APR 13",2022,"22","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1186/s12866-022-02507-z","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12866-022-02507-z",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35418028,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000782422400002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1090,0.0794562436222004,0.9205437563778,"Absence","Uncertain",0.245850943595436,0.754149056404564,"Uncertain"
"Absence","Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is one of the most important cereal crop in the world, and is also the one being seriously affected by heavy metals, particularly aluminium (Al). Keeping in view the utility of barley as food, fodder and raw material for traditional beer brewing, the top-notch quality and higher production of this crop must be sustained. Phosphorus (P) has a quintessential role in plant growth with a potential to relieve symptoms caused by Al poisoning. Displaying a phytopromotive and stress alleviatory potential, Piriformospora indica (P. indica) can improve the stress tolerance in crops. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the mechanism of Al translocation in a variety of crops including barley, however, the bio-remediative studies related to detoxification and/or sequestration of metals are scarce. Therefore, the current study was carried out to elucidate the tolerance mechanism of an Al-sensitive barley cultivar ZU9 following the colonization with P. indica and exogenous P supply by physio-biochemical, elemental, leaf ultrastructural and root proteome an-alyses. When compared to the Al alone treated counterparts, the Al + P + P.i treated plants exhibited 4.1-, 1.38-, 2.7 and 1.35-fold improved root and shoot fresh and dry weights, respectively. With the provision of additional phosphorus, the content of P in the root and shoot for Al + P + P.i group was reportedly higher (71.6% and 49.5%, respectively) as compared to the control group. Moreover, inoculation of P. indica combined with P improved barley leaves' cell arrangement and also maintained normal cell wall shape. The root protemics experiment was divided into three groups: Al, Al + P.i and Al + P + P.i. In total, 28, 598, and 823 differentially expressed proteins were found in Al + P.i vs. Al and Al + P + P.i vs. Al, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis was the most prominently enriched pathway, which contributed significantly to the recuperating effects of P-P. indica interaction. Conslusively, it was found that the percentage of protein related to peroxidase was 70/359 (Al + P + P.i vs. Al) and 92/447 (Al + P + P.i vs. Al + P.i), respectively, which indicated that P. indica in combination with P might be involved in the regulation of peroxidases, increasing the adaptability of barley plants by enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging mechansism.",1426,"Physiological and TMT-based quantitative proteomic responses of barley to aluminium stress under<i> phosphorus-Piriformospora</i><i> indica</i> interaction","Feng, QD; Sehar, S; Zhou, FR; Wei, DM; Askri, SMH; Ma, ZX; Adil, MF; Shamsi, IH",NA,NA,NA,"Feng, Qidong; Sehar, Shafaque; Zhou, Fanrui; Wei, Dongming; Askri, Syed Muhammad Hassan; Ma, Zhengxin; Adil, Muhammad Faheem; Shamsi, Imran Haider",NA,NA,"PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ASKRI, SYED MUHAMMAD HASSAN/ITU-6108-2023; Sehar, Shafaque/JZU-0844-2024; Adil, Muhammad Faheem/AHE-2507-2022","Askri, Syed Muhammad Hassan/0000-0002-9104-8653; Sehar, Shafaque/0000-0003-4606-0175; Adil, Muhammad Faheem/0000-0001-5570-4433",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0981-9428","1873-2690",NA,NA,NA,"MAR",2023,"196",NA,NA,NA,NA,"634","646","10.1016/j.plaphy.2023.02.015","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2023.02.015",NA,"FEB 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36791535,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000944473600001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1381,0.00868460292585793,0.991315397074142,"Uncertain","Uncertain",0.443608606927812,0.556391393072188,"Uncertain"
"Absence","Beneficial plant-associated microorganisms, such as fungal endophytes, are key partners that normally improve plant survival under different environmental stresses. It has been shown that microorganisms from extreme environments, like those associated with the roots of Antarctica plants, can be good partners to increase the performance of crop plants and to restore endangered native plants. Nothofagus alessandrii and N. glauca, are among the most endangered species of Chile, restricted to a narrow and/or limited distributional range associated mainly to the Maulino forest in Chile. Here we evaluated the effect of the inoculation with a fungal consortium of root endophytes isolated from the Antarctic host plant Colobanthus quitensis on the ecophysiological performance [photosynthesis, water use efficiency (WUE), and growth] of both endangered tree species. We also, tested how Antarctic root-fungal endophytes could affect the potential distribution of N. alessandrii through niche modeling. Additionally, we conducted a transplant experiment recording plant survival on 2 years in order to validate the model. Lastly, to evaluate if inoculation with Antarctic endophytes has negative impacts on native soil microorganisms, we compared the biodiversity of fungi and bacterial in the rhizospheric soil of transplanted individuals of N. alessandrii inoculated and non-inoculated with fungal endophytes. We found that inoculation with root-endophytes produced significant increases in N. alessandrii and N. glauca photosynthetic rates, water use efficiencies and cumulative growth. In N. alessandrii, seedling survival was significantly greater on inoculated plants compared with non-inoculated individuals.

Inoculation with root-fungal endophytes, did not reduce native rhizospheric microbiome diversity.

"Absence","Certain species of the Pooideae subfamily develop stress tolerance and herbivory resistance through symbiosis with vertically transmitted, asexual fungi. This symbiosis is specific, and genetic factors modulate the compatibility between partners. Although gene flow is clearly a fitness trait in allogamous grasses, because it injects hybrid vigor and raw material for evolution, it could reduce compatibility and thus mutualism effectiveness. To explore the importance of host genetic background in modulating the performance of symbiosis, Lolium multiflorum plants, infected and noninfected with Neotyphodium occultans, were crossed with genetically distant plants of isolines (susceptible and resistant to diclofop-methyl herbicide) bred from two cultivars and exposed to stress. The endophyte improved seedling survival in genotypes susceptible to herbicide, while it had a negative effect on one of the genetically resistant crosses. Mutualism provided resistance to herbivory independently of the host genotype, but this effect vanished under stress. While no endophyte effect was observed on host reproductive success, it was increased by interpopulation plant crosses. Neither gene flow nor herbicide had an important impact on endophyte transmission. Host fitness improvements attributable to gene flow do not appear to result in direct conflict with mutualism while this seems to be an important mechanism for the ecological and contemporary evolution of the symbiotum.",1698,"Mutualism effectiveness and vertical transmission of symbiotic fungal endophytes in response to host genetic background","Gundel, PE; Martínez-Ghersa, MA; Omacini, M; Cuyeu, R; Pagano, E; Ríos, R; Ghersa, CM",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro E.; Martinez-Ghersa, Maria A.; Omacini, Marina; Cuyeu, Romina; Pagano, Elba; Rios, Raul; Ghersa, Claudio M.",NA,NA,"EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013","Omacini, Marina/0000-0003-1460-262X; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1752-4571",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2012,"5","8",NA,NA,NA,"838","849","10.1111/j.1752-4571.2012.00261.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-4571.2012.00261.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,23346228,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000312808900006",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1644,0.00907914724868697,0.990920852751313,"Uncertain","Uncertain",0.452827277588426,0.547172722411574,"Uncertain"
"Absence","Cowpea [(Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp)] is highly susceptible to the emerging guava root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne enterolobii, with available management options being limited due to the withdrawal of effective fumigant nematicides from the agrochemical markets. Filamentous fungi, available as Biocult (a.i. Glomus species + Trichoderma asperellum Lieckf and Nirenberg) and Nemafric-BL phytonematicide (a.i. cucurbitacin B) each improves plant growth and suppresses nematode population densities. However, when filamentous fungi like Biocult are combined with other biocontrol agents, the combined effects either have synergestic or antagonistic effects on the test variables. The combined effects of Biocult and cucurbitacin phytonematicides on plant growth and nematode suppression remain undocumented. The objective of this study was therefore to determine the combined effects of Biocult and Nemafric-BL phytonematicide on growth of cowpea var. Eureka and suppression of M. enterolobii population densities. Eureka was subjected to the effects of the two products in a 2 × 2 factorial experiment on a field infested with M. enterolobii. At harvest, the interaction of Biocult and Nemafric-BL phytonematicide was highly significant (P ≤ 0.01) on plant and nematode variables, with a two-way table used to assess the findings. Relative to untreated control, Biocult alone increased plant growth variables from 15 to 74%. Similarly, NemafricBL phytonematicide increased plant variables from 14 to 61%, whereas the combined effects significantly increased dry shoot mass (19%) and dry harvestable leaf mass (21%), but did not have significant effects on plant height and stem diameter. Relative to untreated control, Biocult alone reduced nematode eggs in root (80%), J2 in root (84%) and J2 in soil (53%), whereas the combined relative effects of the two products did not have significant effects on nematode population densities. In conclusion, Biocult and Nemafric-BL phytonematicide had antagonistic effects on growth of cowpea and suppression of M. enterolobii population densities and therefore, should be used separately in cowpea production.

"Absence","Dark septate endophytes of the Phialocephala fortinii s.l. - Acephala applanata species complex (PAC) are abundant root colonizers of woody plants in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems where they form complex communities. Community structure was spatially stable for 3 years in a previous experiment, suggesting PAC's inability to disperse or mutual inhibition of neighboring PAC genotypes. The aim of this study was to test whether changes in PAC community structure occur at all. The community structure originally determined in 2004 was reassessed in 2014 in a Norway-spruce plantation using microsatellite genotyping. Most isolates belonged to Phialocephala turicensis, P. letzii, P. europaea, and P. helvetica in both years. P. uotilensis and Acephala applanata were rare. PAC species were the same at only two grid points in both years. P. europaea was more frequent than P. turicensis in 2004 whereas the situation was opposite in 2014. Only four of the 22 genotypes in 2004 were found in 2014. Interestingly, none of the genotypes was detected at the same grid points in both years. Extended sampling in 2014 led to a significantly higher number of grid points testing positive for the presence of P. turicensis and P. helvetica. More than 3 years are required to detect shifts in PAC community structures.

"Absence","Despite their minute biomass, microbial symbionts of plants potentially alter herbivory, diversity and community structure. Infection of grasses by asexual endophytic fungi often decreases herbivore loads and alters arthropod diversity. However, most studies to date have involved agronomic grasses and often consider only infection status (infected vs. uninfected), without explicitly measuring endophyte-produced alkaloids, which vary among endophyte isolates and may impact consumers. We combined field experiments and population surveys to investigate how endophyte infection and associated alkaloids influence abundances, species richness, evenness and guild structure of arthropod communities on a native grass, Achnatherum robustum (sleepygrass). Surprisingly, we found that endophyte-produced alkaloids were associated with increased herbivore abundances and species richness. Our results suggest that, unlike what has been found in agronomic grass systems, high alkaloid levels in native grasses may not protect host grasses from arthropod herbivores, and may instead more negatively affect natural enemies of herbivores.

"Absence","Diverse fungi live all or part of their life cycle inside plants as asymptomatic endophytes. While endophytic fungi are increasingly recognized as significant components of plant fitness, it is unclear how they interact with plant cells; why they occur throughout the fungal kingdom; and why they are associated with most fungal lifestyles. Here we evaluate the diversity of endophytic fungi that are able to form novel protoplasts called mycosomes. We found that mycosomes cultured from plants and phylogenetically diverse endophytic fungi have common morphological characteristics, express similar developmental patterns, and can revert back to the free-living walled state. Observed with electron microscopy, mycosome ontogeny within Aureobasidium pullulans may involve two organelles: double membrane-bounded promycosome organelles (PMOs) that form mycosomes, and multivesicular bodies that may form plastid-infecting vesicles. Cultured mycosomes also contain a double membrane-bounded organelle, which may be homologous to the A. pullulans PMO. The mycosome PMO is often expressed as a vacuole-like organelle, which alternatively may contain a lipoid body or a starch grain. Mycosome reversion to walled cells occurs within the PMO, and by budding from lipid or starch-containing mycosomes. Mycosomes discovered in chicken egg yolk provided a plant-independent source for analysis: they formed typical protoplast stages, contained fungal ITS sequences and reverted to walled cells, suggesting mycosome symbiosis with animals as well as plants. Our results suggest that diverse endophytic fungi express a novel protoplast phase that can explain their hidden existence, lifestyle switching, and diversity within the plant kingdom. Importantly, our findings outline ""what, where, when and how'', opening the way for cell and organelle-specific tests using in situ DNA hybridization and fluorescent labels. We discuss developmental, ecological and evolutionary contexts that provide a robust framework for continued tests of the mycosome phase hypothesis.",2186,"Novel Symbiotic Protoplasts Formed by Endophytic Fungi Explain Their Hidden Existence, Lifestyle Switching, and Diversity within the Plant Kingdom","Atsatt, PR; Whiteside, MD",NA,NA,NA,"Atsatt, Peter R.; Whiteside, Matthew D.",NA,NA,"PLOS ONE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Atsatt, Peter/Q-8529-2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1932-6203",NA,NA,NA,NA,"APR 28",2014,"9","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0095266","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0095266",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24777121,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000346241800010",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2115,0.0894585416064011,0.910541458393599,"Absence","Absence",0.00877088326926323,0.991229116730737,"Absence"
"Absence","Endophytes were isolated from six medicinal plants with antioxidant activity, namely, Aconitum carmichaelii, Thalictrum aquilegifolium Linn., Angelicae pubescentis Radix, Plantago asiatica L., Mentha haplocalyx Briq, and Alisma orientale. The active antioxidant ingredients from the fermentation broth of endophytes and mycelium extract were studied. Potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium and Gauze's medium were used to isolate the endophytic fungi and endophytic actinomycetes, respectively. The antioxidant activities of all extracts were measured, the total phenolic and total flavonoid content of the extracts from those endophytes were compared, and high-activity strains were identified using morphological and molecular biological methods. Finally, 43 endophytic fungal strains and 18 endophytic actinomycete strains were isolated. Among them, the endophytic fungi had good antioxidant activity, and six strains (9.84%) showed a strong ·OH free radical scavenging capacity (clearance rate ≥70%). The ethyl acetate extract of the fermentation broth of DHL-10 strain showed strong antioxidant activity; its half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value for hydrogen peroxide radical scavenging was 0.26 mg/mL, and total phenolic and flavonoid content were up to 0.81±0.05 mg/g and 0.84±0.05 mg/g, respectively. DHL-10 strain was identified as an Alternaria sp. by morphological and molecular biological methods.

"Absence","Endophytic fungi act as seed endosymbiont, thereby playing a very crucial role in the growth and development of seeds. Seed-vectored endophytic fungi establish an everlasting association with seeds and travel from generation to generation. To explore the composition and diversity of endophytic fungi in Alpinia zerumbet seeds, high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing was employed for the following stages: fruit formation period (YSJ1), young fruit period (YSJ2), early mature period (YSJ3), middle mature period (YSJ4), and late mature period (YSJ5). A total of 906,694 sequence reads and 745 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained and further classified into 8 phyla, 30 classes, 73 orders, 163 families, 302 genera, and 449 species. The highest endophytic fungal diversity was observed at YSJ5. The genera with the highest abundance were Cladosporium, Kodamaea, Hannaella, Mycothermus, Gibberella, Sarocladium, and Neopestalotiopsis. Functional Guild (FUNGuild) analysis revealed that endophytic fungi were undefined saprotroph, plant pathogens, animal pathogen-endophyte-lichen parasite-plant pathogen-wood saprotroph, and soil saprotrophs. Alternaria, Fusarium, Cladosporium, and Sarocladium, which are potential probiotics and can be used as biocontrol agents, were also abundant.

"Absence","Endophytic fungi associated with leaves and stem tissues of Boswellia sacra growing in Dhofar Mountains of Oman were investigated from May 2008 through October 2011. The biological diversity, tissue-preference and seasonal variations of fungi were evaluated. Forty-three species and 3 varieties of fungi were recovered as new records from this plant. Of these isolates, 35 species are new reports to the mycoflora of Oman, whereas 12 species were added to the list of fungal flora of the Arabian Peninsula. The genus Alternaria (12 species) is the most prevalent genus recovered from 12.5-83.3% of the screened leaves and stem samples, followed by Aspergillus (5 species, 3 varieties, 6.9-86.1%), Mycelia sterilia (76.4%), Rhizopus stolonifer (62.5%), Drechslera (3 species, 40.354.2%), Cladosporium (3 species, 20.8-52.8%), Curvularia lunata (38.8%), Chaetomium (2 species, 15.3-26.3%), Penicillim spp. (9.827.8%), Fusarium (9 species, 6.9-27.8%), Ulocladium consortiale (27.8%), Mucor hiemalis (19.5%), and the remaining species (Scytalidium thermophilum, Phoma solani, Taeniolella exilis, and Botryodiplodia theobromae) exhibited very low levels of incidence (4.2-11.1%). Endophytic colonization of the leaf tissues was greater (43 species, 3 varieties) comparable to stem tissues (25 species). This indicates heterogeneity and tissue-preference, with no evidence of seasonal variation. Therefore, the isolation of many fungal species and sterile mycelia supports the biodiversity of the endophytic fungi invading B. sacra and the high possibility of isolating more fungal species using advanced molecular techniques.",2867,"Endophytic fungi associated with endogenous Boswellia sacra","El-Nagerabi S.A.F.; Elshafie A.E.; Alkhanjari S.S.",NA,"",NA,"El-Nagerabi, Saifeldin A.F.

"Absence","Endophytic fungi can have a positive impact on phytoremediation of heavy metals, but the effects of endophytic fungus Microdochium bolleyi on extraction of Cd by barley, have not been previously examined. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to assess the effects of M. bolleyi (strain B26) on cadmium (Cd) tolerance, accumulation and translocation by barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) (Sararood cultivar) under Cd stress. Barley plants were inoculated with B26 in Cd-added sands (0, 10, 30, 60 mg Cd kg(-1) sand), and the various attributes of growth along with the amount of Cd in barley were investigated after two months. The results indicated that fungal inoculation significantly improved (p < 0.05) plant growth in the presence of Cd by enhancing factors of plant growth; shoot length increased by 8.93%, 11.61% and 5.59%, root length by 26.47%, 12.39% and 13.95%, dry root biomass by 6.35%, 8.57% and 28.57%, dry shoot biomass by 11.39%, 8.25% and 4.81% in soil containing 10, 30 and 60 mg Cd kg(-1), respectively. The increases in chlorophyll content were 16.74% and 9.97% under 10 and 30 mg Cd kg(-1) treatments, in turn. In terms of Cd accumulation, fungal inoculation increased the amount of Cd in the barley roots, by 44%, 27.95% and 25.18% in soil containing 10, 30 and 60 mg Cd kg(-1), respectively, but it remained the same in plant leaves whether the plants were inoculated or not. The results suggested B26 can be exploited to improve the potential of barley for the remediation of Cd contaminated sites.",2887,"Effects of root endophytic fungus, <i>Microdochium bolleyi</i> on cadmium uptake, translocation and tolerance by <i>Hordeum vulgare</i> L.","Shadmani, L; Jamali, S; Fatemi, A",NA,NA,NA,"Shadmani, Leila; Jamali, Samad; Fatemi, Akram",NA,NA,"BIOLOGIA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Fatemi, Akram/IVH-1277-2023; Jamali, Samad/KVC-0252-2024","Fatemi, Akram/0000-0002-1675-8006; Jamali, Samad/0000-0001-9422-0618",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0006-3088","1336-9563",NA,NA,NA,"FEB",2021,"76","2",NA,NA,NA,"711","719","10.2478/s11756-020-00598-5","http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-020-00598-5",NA,"SEP 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000568470700001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2796,0.0802009755464409,0.919799024453559,"Absence","Absence",0.0152046336608117,0.984795366339188,"Absence"
"Absence","Endophytic fungi have been emerged as fruitful resources for producing structurally fascinating and biologically active secondary metabolites. However, endophytic fungi from medicinal plants of Qinling Mountains-the most important natural climatic boundary between the subtropical and warm temperate zones of China with an astonishingly high level of biodiversity-have rarely been explored as potential sources of novel fungal species and active secondary metabolites. In this study, a total of 371 fungal colonies were successfully isolated from 510 tissue segments of the medicinal Tupistra chinensis Baker collected from Qinling Mountains, China. Roots of T. chinensis Baker are used as a folk medicine to ameliorate pharyngitis and treat rheumatic diseases. A total of 100 representative morphotype strains were identified according to ITS rDNA sequence analyses and were grouped into three phyla (Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mucoromycota), seven classes (Dothideomycetes, Sordariomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Microbotryomycetes, Agaricomycetes, Leotiomycetes, Mortierellomycetes), and at least 35 genera. The genera of Collectotrichum (IF, 29.92%), Fusarium (IF, 8.36%), Aspergillus (IF, 8.09%), and Dactylonectria (IF, 5.39%) were most frequently isolated from the tissues of T. chinensis Baker. The Species Richness Index (S, 65) and the ShannonWiener Index (H, 3.7914) indicated that T. chinensis Baker harbored abundant fungal resources. Moreover, five isolates were potential new taxa because of low similarity of ITS sequences ranged from 95.09%-96.61%. Fifteen out of 100 endophytic fungal ethyl acetate extracts exhibited inhibitory activities against at least one pathogenic bacterium or fungus. Two important lead compounds produced by two stains (F8047 and F8075) with high antimicrobial activities were identified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF MS) analyses. In addition, it was noteworthy that the strain F8001, which may be a potential new species, showed antimicrobial activity and should be investigated further. Overall, these results indicated that the endophytic fungi from T. chinensis Baker could be exploited as a novel source of bioactive compounds.",2954,"Isolation, diversity, and antimicrobial activity of fungal endophytes from <i>Rohdea</i> <i>chinensis</i> (Baker) N.Tanaka (synonym <i>Tupistra chinensis</i> Baker) of Qinling Mountains, China","An, C; Ma, SJ; Shi, XW; Xue, WJ; Liu, C; Ding, H",NA,NA,NA,"An, Chao; Ma, Saijian; Shi, Xinwei; Xue, Wenjiao; Liu, Chen; Ding, Hao",NA,NA,"PEERJ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"An, Chao/0000-0002-3254-6871",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2167-8359",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JUN 17",2020,"8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.7717/peerj.9342","http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9342",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32596051,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000540654900007",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2858,0.0175179344823923,0.982482065517608,"Absence","Absence",0.0854552244266908,0.914544775573309,"Absence"
"Absence","Endophytic fungi in symbiotic association with their host plant are well known to improve plant growth and reduce the adverse effects of both biotic and abiotic stresses. Therefore, fungal endophytes are beginning to receive increased attention in an effort to find growth-promoting strains that could be applied to enhance crop yield and quality. In our study, the plant growth-promoting activities of endophytic fungi isolated from various parts of Sophora flavescens (a medicinally important plant in Mongolia and China) have been revealed and investigated. Fungal isolates were identified using molecular taxonomical methods, while their plant growth-promoting abilities were evaluated in plate assays. Altogether, 15 strains were isolated, representing the genera Alternaria, Didymella, Fusarium and Xylogone. Five of the isolates possessed phosphate solubilization activities and twelve secreted siderophores, while all of them were able to produce indoleacetic acid (IAA) in the presence or absence of tryptophan. The endogenous and exogenous accumulation of IAA were also monitored in liquid cultures using the HPLC-MS/MS technique to refine the plate assay results. Furthermore, for the highest IAA producer fungi, the effects of their extracts were also examined in plant bioassays. In these tests, the primary root lengths of the model Arabidopsis thaliana were increased in several cases, while the biomasses were significantly lower than the control IAA treatment. Significant alterations have also been detected in the photosynthetic pigment (chlorophyll-a, -b and carotenoids) content due to the fungal extract treatments, but these changes did not show any specific trends.",2993,"Characterization of the Plant Growth-Promoting Activities of Endophytic Fungi Isolated from <i>Sophora flavescens</i>","Turbat, A; Rakk, D; Vigneshwari, A; Kocsubé, S; Thu, H; Szepesi, A; Bakacsy, L; Skrbic, BD; Jigjiddorj, EA; Vágvölgyi, C; Szekeres, A",NA,NA,NA,"Turbat, Adiyadolgor; Rakk, David; Vigneshwari, Aruna; Kocsube, Sandor; Huynh Thu; Szepesi, Agnes; Bakacsy, Laszlo; Skrbic, Biljana D.; Jigjiddorj, Enkh-Amgalan; Vagvolgyi, Csaba; Szekeres, Andras",NA,NA,"MICROORGANISMS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Szepesi, Agnes/AAK-8966-2020; Bakacsy, László/AAW-3995-2021; Vagvolgyi, Csaba/L-8497-2018; Szepesi, Agnes/L-8814-2018; Bakacsy, Laszlo/L-9778-2018; Skrbic, Biljana/T-1660-2019; Szekeres, Andras/I-8956-2012","Szepesi, Agnes/0000-0003-3043-4857; RAMASAMY, ARUNA VIGNESHWARI/0000-0002-8131-1518; Bakacsy, Laszlo/0000-0003-2593-1795; Skrbic, Biljana/0000-0002-8615-8989; Vagvolgyi, Csaba/0000-0003-0009-7773; Szekeres, Andras/0000-0003-1651-4623; Kocsube, Sandor/0000-0001-7839-0510; Turbat, Adiyadolgor/0000-0002-2072-9689",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2076-2607",NA,NA,NA,"MAY",2020,"8","5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/microorganisms8050683","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8050683",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32392856,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000540222300064",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2893,0.00803177081489448,0.991968229185106,"Absence","Uncertain",0.24174342858423,0.75825657141577,"Uncertain"

"Absence","Epichloe spp. are symbiotic fungal endophytes of many cool season grasses. The presence of the fungal endophytes often confers insect, drought, and disease tolerance to the host grasses. The presence of the fungal endophytes within the host plants does not elicit host defense responses. The molecular basis for this phenomenon is not known. Epichloe festucae, the endophyte of Festuca rubra, expresses a salicylate hydroxylase similar to NahG from the bacterium Pseudomonas putida. Few fungal salicylate hydroxylase enzymes have been reported. The in planta expression of an endophyte salicylate hydroxylase raised the possibility that degradation of plant-produced salicylic acid is a factor in the mechanism of how the endophyte avoids eliciting host plant defenses. Here we report the characterization of the E. festucae salicylate hydroxylase, designated Efe-shyA. Although the fungal enzyme has the expected activity, based on salicylic acid levels in endophyte-free and endophyte-infected plants it is unlikely that expression of the endophyte salicylate hydroxylase is a factor in the lack of a host defense response to the presence of the fungal endophyte.",3321,"Functional characterization of salicylate hydroxylase from the fungal endophyte <i>Epichloe festucae</i>","Ambrose, KV; Tian, ZP; Wang, YF; Smith, J; Zylstra, G; Huang, BR; Belanger, FC",NA,NA,NA,"Ambrose, Karen V.; Tian, Zipeng; Wang, Yifei; Smith, Jordan; Zylstra, Gerben; Huang, Bingru; Belanger, Faith C.",NA,NA,"SCIENTIFIC REPORTS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wang, Yifei/M-9923-2015","Zylstra, Gerben/0000-0003-0419-1353",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2045-2322",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JUN 9",2015,"5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1038/srep10939","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep10939",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,26055188,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000356082000001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3210,0.15036677280887,0.84963322719113,"Absence","Uncertain",0.236540013204303,0.763459986795697,"Uncertain"
"Absence","Exploring endophytic fungi may provide alternative, plant-based ethnomedicines. The discovery of endophytic fungi can produce many plant-derived drugs that give new horizons to the pharmaceutical industry for the availability and production of such medicines on a large scale. Extracts from Syzygium aqueum Alston (jambu air), a fruit-bearing plant native to Indonesia, have long been used in traditional medicine. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to identify, and investigate, the antimicrobial activity of the endophytic fungi found in S. aqueum. Results revealed that total16 fungi were isolated from different tissues (stem bark, root bark, and leaves) of the plant. Fungal endophytes were identified through morphological characterization and subsequently compared with key fungal identification books. The ethyl acetate extracts of the isolated endophytic fungi were screened for their antimicrobial activity through paper disc diffusion assay fungi isolated from S. aqueum were identified as: Aspergillus niger (Isolate code R21, R41, T72), Cylindrocarpon sp. (Isolate code R11, R31), Trichoderma aureoviridae (Isolate code T11), Trichoderma harzianum (Isolate code T21), Trichoderma sp. (Isolate code T31), Pestalotia sp.

All families were established in spaced-plant nurseries and trial plots at two locations in Galicia, in 1992. E+ families had a significantly (P < 0.05) higher first cut, spring and total yield than E-families at one location in the third year after planting. At this location, water deficit was about 75% higher than at the other location in all three years of study. Endophyte did not affect crown rust susceptibility or forage quality (crude protein, water-soluble carbohydrate and in vitro digestibility). Ergovaline alkaloid concentration in the 28 E+ families varied from 0 to 0.55 mu g/g dry matter (DM) (mean 0.15), with 14 families containing levels of ergovaline >0.1 mu g/g DM.

"Absence","Functional symbiosis is considered one of the successful mechanisms by which plants that inhabit extreme environment improve their ability to tolerate different types of stress. One of the most conspicuous type of symbiosis is the endophyticism. This interaction has been noted to play a role in the adaptation of the native vascular plant Colobanthus quitensis to the stressful environments of Antarctica, characterized by low temperatures and extreme aridity. Projections of climate change for this ecosystem indicate that abiotic conditions will be less limiting due to an increase in temperature and water availability in the soil. Due to this decrease in stress induced by the climate change, it has been suggested that the positive role of fungal endophytes on performance of C. quitensis plants would decrease. In this study, we evaluated the role of endophytic fungi on osmoprotective molecules (sugar production, proline, oxidative stress) and gene expression (CqNCED1, CqABCG25, and CqRD22) as well as physiological traits (stomatal opening, net photosynthesis, and stomatal conductance) in individuals of C. quitensis. Individual plants of C. quitensis with (E+) and without (E-) endophytic fungi were exposed to simulated conditions of increased water availability (W+), having the current limiting water condition (W-) in Antarctica as control. The results reveal an endophyte-mediated lower oxidative stress, higher production of sugars and proline in plants. In addition, E+ plants showed differential expressions in genes related with drought stress response, which was more evident in W- than in W+. These parameters corresponded with increased physiological mechanisms such as higher net photosynthesis, stomatal opening and conductance under presence of endophytes (E+) as well as the projected water condition (W+) for Antarctica. These results suggest that the presence of fungal endophytes plays a positive role in favoring tolerance to drought in C. quitensis. However, this positive role would be diminished if the stress factor is relaxed, suggesting that the role of endophytes could be less important under a future scenario of climate change in Antarctica with higher soil water availability.",3699,"Fungal Endophytes Exert Positive Effects on <i>Colobanthus quitensis</i> Under Water Stress but Neutral Under a Projected Climate Change Scenario in Antarctica","Hereme, R; Morales-Navarro, S; Ballesteros, G; Barrera, A; Ramos, P; Gundel, PE; Molina-Montenegro, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Hereme, Rasme; Morales-Navarro, Samuel; Ballesteros, Gabriel; Barrera, Andrea; Ramos, Patricio; Gundel, Pedro E.; Molina-Montenegro, Marco A.",NA,NA,"FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Ballesteros, Gabriel/IAN-7082-2023; Ramos, Patricio/ABE-5961-2021; Ramos, Patricio/B-6665-2017","Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Ballesteros, Gabriel/0000-0002-3179-3168; Ramos, Patricio/0000-0001-8341-314X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-302X",NA,NA,NA,"FEB 28",2020,"11",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2020.00264","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00264",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32184767,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000524593400001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3576,0.0540037389704044,0.945996261029596,"Absence","Absence",0.0605456230994317,0.939454376900568,"Absence"

"Absence","Fungal endophytes inhabit a similar ecological niche to that occupied by many phytopathogens, with several pathogens isolated from healthy tissues in their latent phase. This study aimed to evaluate the pathogenicity, the colonisation ability, and the enzyme activity of 37 endophytic fungal isolates recovered from apparently healthy apple shoot and leaf tissues. The pathogenicity of the isolates was assessed on ‘Royal Gala’ and ‘Braeburn’ fruit and detached ‘Royal Gala’ shoots. For the non-pathogenic isolates, their ability to endophytically colonise detached ‘Royal Gala’ shoots was evaluated. Enzyme activity assays were undertaken to determine whether the pathogenicity of the endophytes was related to the production of the extracellular enzymes, amylase, cellulase, pectinase, protease, and xylanase. Of the 37 isolates studied, eight isolates, representing the genera Colletotrichum, Diaporthe, Fusarium, and Penicillium, were shown to be pathogenic on both apple shoots and fruit. Two isolates identified as Trichoderma atroviride, were pathogenic only on shoots, and three isolates, representing the genus Diaporthe, were pathogenic only on fruit. Of the remaining 24 isolates, 22 (Biscogniauxia (n = 8), Chaetomium (n = 4), Trichoderma (n = 3), Epicoccum (n = 2), Neosetophoma (n = 2), Xylaria (n = 1), Daldinia (n = 1), and Paraphaeosphaeria (n = 1)) were recovered from the inoculated apple shoots but two failed to colonise the shoot tissues. Of the isolates tested, 20 produced amylase, 15 cellulase, 25 pectinase, 26 protease, and 13 xylanase. There was no correlation between the range and type of enzymes produced by the isolates and their pathogenicity or ability to endophytically colonise the shoot tissue. The study showed that approximately one-third (13/37) of the isolates recovered from the apparently healthy apple shoot tissues were observed as latent pathogens. The isolates that did not cause disease symptoms may have the ability to reduce colonisation of apple tissues by pathogens including Neonectria ditissima associated with European canker of apple. © 2024 The Authors",3853,"Endophytic fungal isolates from apple tissue: Latent pathogens lurking within?","Nwe L.L.; Casonato S.; Jones E.E.",NA,"",NA,"Nwe, Lay Lay (59134540900); Casonato, Seona (25227720700); Jones, E.

"Absence","Fungal endophytes live inside plant tissues and some have been found to provide benefits to their host. Nevertheless, their ecological impact is not adequately understood. Considering the fact that endophytes are continuously interacting with their hosts, it is conceivable that both partners have substantial influence on each other's metabolic processes. In this context, we have investigated the action of the endophytic fungus Paraconiothyrium variabile, isolated from the leaves of Cephalotaxus harringtonia, on the secondary metabolome of the host-plant. The alteration of the leaf compounds by the fungus was monitored through metabolomic approaches followed by structural characterization of the altered products. Out of more than a thousand molecules present in the crude extract of the plant leaf, we have observed a specific biotransformation of glycosylated flavonoids by the endophyte. In all cases it led to the production of the corresponding aglycone via deglycosylation. The deglycosylated flavonoids turned out to display significant beneficial effects on the hyphal growth of germinated spores. Our finding, along with the known allelopathic role of flavonoids, illustrates the chemical cooperation underlying the mutualistic relationship between the plant and the endophyte.

"Absence","Green fabrication of nanoparticles (NPs) using biological sources is the fast-growing trend replacing chemical synthesis via toxic materials. Considering the importance and feasibility of green fabricated NPs, the present research focuses on the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using the aqueous extract of the endophytic Cladosporium sp. (MycoAuNPs) isolated from Commiphora wightii. The synthesized MycoAuNPs are characterized using UV–Vis spectroscopic, FTIR, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The synthesized NPs showed a sharp absorption peak at 524 nm, with an average size between 5 and 10 nm in a spherical shape. XRD revealed the crystalline nature, and EDX profiling confirmed the presence of gold (Au) and oxygen (O) atoms. The biological potential of MycoAuNPs were tested under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. MycoAuNPs showed anti-cancer activity in breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (IC50 38.23 µg/mL) through the induction of apoptosis. Further, MycoAuNPs showed potential against growth of tumor in tumor-bearing mice models. MycoAuNPs significantly reduced the body weight, ascites volume, and increased the lifespan of EAC bearing mice. It induced apoptosis of the EAC cells, which was confirmed by DNA fragmentation and Giemsa staining. Also, they did not develop any secondary complications or side effects in normal mice. The photocatalytic activity of MycoAuNPs tested against Rhodamine B and Methylene Blue dyes showed potential dye degradation in the presence of sunlight. Thus, the present study gives a clear idea of the multifaceted therapeutic and catalytic applications of the biosynthesized MycoAuNPs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",4209,"Biofabrication of gold nanoparticles mediated by the endophytic Cladosporium species: Photodegradation, in vitro anticancer activity and in vivo antitumor studies","Munawer U.; Raghavendra V.B.; Ningaraju S.; Krishna K.L.; Ghosh A.R.; Melappa G.; Pugazhendhi A.",NA,"",NA,"Munawer, Uzma (57218449412); Raghavendra, Vinay Basavegowda (15849658600); Ningaraju, Sunayana (57218455500); Krishna, Kamsagara Linganna (57193997316); Ghosh, Abhinav Raj (57217289151); Melappa, Govindappa (56999144000); Pugazhendhi, Arivalagan (57191625854)",NA,NA,"International Journal of Pharmaceutics",NA,NA,"English","","","","",NA,"Anticancer; Antitumor; Apoptosis; Cytotoxicity; Endophytic fungi; Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs); MCF-7","Animals; Cladosporium; Gold; Green Chemistry Technology; Metal Nanoparticles; Mice; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Photolysis; Plant Extracts; fungal extract; gold nanoparticle; gold; metal nanoparticle; plant extract; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; ascites tumor; Cladosporium; Commiphora; Commiphora wightii; controlled study; drug absorption; drug synthesis; endophytic fungus; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; IC50; in vitro study; in vivo study; MCF-7 cell line; mouse; nanofabrication; nonhuman; particle size; photodegradation; plant leaf; priority journal; transmission electron microscopy; ultraviolet spectroscopy; animal; green chemistry; photolysis","Teresian Research Foundation, Siddarthanagar, Mysore, 570011, India; Department of Microbiology and Cell Biology, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India; JSS College of Pharmacy, Shivarathreeshwara Nagar, Mysore, 570015, India; P.G.

"Absence","High temperature is one of the compelling ecological stresses faced by the plants owing to anthropogenic activities of mankind. Recently, endophytic fungi are considered to be a novel tool to counteract the consequences of thermal stress in crops. Owing to the problem, we isolated fungal endophytes from Dryopteris blanfordii and their growth favoring potential in rice seedlings. Endophytic fungi have the proficiency to secrete plant growth stimulating secondary metabolites that help the host plants to restore growth under harsh environments. The isolated Penicillium glabrum (DryR30) helped the host plant species, i.e. Glycine max L. and Helianthus annuus L. under thermal stress. P. glabrum associated with G. max and H. annuus exposed to 40 & ordm;C not only boosted their host growth attributes (total biomass, plant height and chlorophyll contents), but also significantly curtailed the synthesis of reactive oxygen species and lipids peroxidation. Moreover, the abscisic acid (ABA) and proline concentrations were significantly reduced, while the accumulation of ROS-degrading enzymes, such as catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), ascorbic acid oxidase (AAO), glutathione reductase (GR) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were increased in P. glabrum-associated crops. Additionally, the protein,lipid and sugar contents in tested plants were also improved. These stirring findings suggest that P. glabrum can be applied to food crops as a thermal stress alleviation tool.",4281,"Penicillium Glabrum Acted as a Heat Stress Relieving Endophyte in Soybean and Sunflower","Ismail; Hamayun, M; Hussain, A; Iqbal, A; Khan, SA; Gul, S; Khan, H; Rehman, KU; Bibi, H; Lee, IJ",NA,NA,NA,"Ismail; Hamayun, Muhammad; Hussain, Anwar; Iqbal, Amjad; Khan, Sumera Afzal; Gul, Sarah; Khan, Hamayoon; Rehman, Khushnood Ur; Bibi, Hamida; Lee, In-Jung",NA,NA,"POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Khan, Abdul/H-5910-2011; Hamayun, Muhammad/B-1694-2010; Ur rehman, Khushnood/AAZ-1468-2021; Hussain, Anwar/N-1605-2019; Iqbal, Amjad/E-2010-2014; Lee, In-Jung/GLS-0432-2022","Iqbal, Amjad/0000-0001-6141-8337; Hussain, Anwar/0000-0002-2539-2843",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1230-1485","2083-5906",NA,NA,NA,NA,2021,"30","4",NA,NA,NA,"3099","3110","10.15244/pjoes/128579","http://dx.doi.org/10.15244/pjoes/128579",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000659524800003",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4137,0.0271372680569856,0.972862731943014,"Absence","Absence",0.0489058478970503,0.95109415210295,"Absence"
"Absence","In many respects, the ecology of members of the Botryosphaeriaceae compare to general patterns observed for the collective of endophytes of woody plants. These include high levels of diversity, horizontal transmission a spatial structure and a continuum of levels of host affinity from specific to very broad. Some members of the Botryosphaeriaceae are, however, among the most aggressive pathogens in the assemblages of common endophytic fungi, often killing large parts of their host, following physical damage or general stress on the host (and over large areas). Their wide occurrence, the latent phase which can be overlooked by quarantine, and their ability to rapidly cause disease when their hosts are under stress, make these fungi a significant threat to agricultural, plantation and native forest ecosystems alike. This is especially relevant under emerging conditions of dramatic climate change that increases stress on plant communities. It is, therefore, important to maximize our understanding of the ecology and pathology of the Botryosphaeriaceae, particularly as it relates to their endophytic nature, species richness, host switching ability and the host-fungus-environment interaction. © 2007 The British Mycological Society.",4429,"Botryosphaeriaceae as endophytes and latent pathogens of woody plants: diversity, ecology and impact","Slippers B.; Wingfield M.J.",NA,"",NA,"Slippers, Bernard (6603218395); Wingfield, Michael J.

"Absence","In order to investigate the diversity of endophytes, fungal endophytes in Panax ginseng Meyer cultivated in Korea were isolated and identified using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of ribosomal DNA. Three cultivars of 3-year-old ginseng roots (Chunpoong, Yunpoong, and Gumpoong) were used to isolate fungal endophytes. Surface sterilized ginseng roots were placed on potato dextrose agar plates supplemented with ampicilin and streptomycin to inhibit bacterial growth. Overall, 38 fungal endophytes were isolated from 12 ginseng roots. According to the sequence analysis of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2, 38 fungal isolates were classified into 4 different fungal species, which were Phoma radicina, Fusarium oxysporum, Setophoma terrestris and Ascomycota sp. 2-RNK. The most dominant fungal endophyte was P radicina in 3 cultivars. The percentage of dominant endophytes of P. radicina was 65.8%. The percentage of colonization frequency of P radicina was 80%, 52.9%, and 75% in Chunpoong, Yunpoong, and Gumpoong, respectively. The second most dominant fungal endophyte was F oxysporum. The diversity of the fungal endophytes was low and no ginseng cultivar specificity among endophytes was detected in this study. The identified endophytes can be potential fungi for the production of bioactive compounds and control against ginseng pathogens.",4454,"Fungal Endophytes from Three Cultivars of <i>Panax ginseng</i> Meyer Cultivated in Korea","Park, SU; Lim, HS; Park, KC; Park, YH; Bae, H",NA,NA,NA,"Park, Sang Un; Lim, Hyoun-Sub; Park, Kee-Choon; Park, Young-Hwan; Bae, Hanhong",NA,NA,"JOURNAL OF GINSENG RESEARCH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Lim, Hyoun/0000-0001-5690-3864",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1226-8453","2093-4947",NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2012,"36","1",NA,NA,NA,"107","113","10.5142/jgr.2012.36.1.107","http://dx.doi.org/10.5142/jgr.2012.36.1.107",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,23717111,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000299198800013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4301,0.0814499536380877,0.918550046361912,"Absence","Uncertain",0.220324481180716,0.779675518819284,"Uncertain"
"Absence","In the light of the fast growing several applications of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) in different industrial and agricultural sectors, this paper was conducted to explore the suitability of endophytic fungi as nano-factories for SeNPs. Thus, 75 fungal isolates were recovered from plant tissues and tested for their efficacy to biosynthesize SeNPs. Four promising strains were found able to synthesis SeNPs with different characteristics and identified. These strains were Aspergillus quadrilineatus isolated from the twigs of Ricinus communis, Aspergillus ochraceus isolated from the leaves of Ricinus communis, Aspergillus terreus isolated from the twigs of Azadirachta indica, and Fusarium equiseti isolated from the twigs of Hibiscus rose-sinensis. The synthesized SeNPs were characterized by several techniques viz., UV-Vis, X-ray diffraction, Dynamic light scattering analyses, High resolution transmission electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, to study their crystalline structure, particle sized distribution, and morphology. Furthermore, the in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities were evaluated. SeNPs synthesized by the four strains showed potent antifungal and antibacterial potentials against different human and phyto- pathogens. Moreover, SeNPs synthesized by the respective strains showed promising antioxidant power with IC50 values of 198.32, 151.23, 100.31, and 91.52 mu g mL(- 1). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the use of endophytic fungi for SeNPs' biosynthesis. The presented research recommends the use of endophytic fungi as facile one-pot production bio-factories of SeNPs with promising characteristics.",4540,"Harnessing endophytic fungi for biosynthesis of selenium nanoparticles and exploring their bioactivities","Hussein, HG; El-Sayed, ER; Younis, NA; Hamdy, AA; Easa, SM",NA,NA,NA,"Hussein, Heba G.; El-Sayed, El-Sayed R.; Younis, Nahed A.; Hamdy, Abd El Hamid A.; Easa, Saadia M.",NA,NA,"AMB EXPRESS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ramadan El-Sayed, El-Sayed/ABA-4025-2020","Ramadan El-Sayed, El-Sayed/0000-0001-7867-3801",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2191-0855",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JUN 8",2022,"12","1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1186/s13568-022-01408-8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13568-022-01408-8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35674975,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000808338000001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4386,0.0700028870667508,0.929997112933249,"Absence","Uncertain",0.254333931948792,0.745666068051208,"Uncertain"

"Absence","Lipid accumulation abilities of two endophytic fungal isolates - Colletotrichum sp. and Alternaria sp. grown under optimum and nutrient-stress conditions were investigated and compared. Significant variations in lipid contents, ranging from 30% to 58% of their dry biomass were found in liquid culture using various carbon sources. Since, >50% of the total lipid was estimated to be neutral lipid for both the fungal species, predicted biodiesel properties were theoretically calculated based upon the determined fatty acid profiles: and the values were found to be comparable to those of commonly used plant oils for biodiesel production. The two endophytes grew successfully on the combined rice straw and wheat bran as substrate that was degraded by their secretory enzymes including cellulase [1.21-2.51 FPU/g dry substrate (gds)] in solid state fermentation and produced substantial amount of lipid (60.32-84.30 mg/gds).

"Absence","Maize in Indonesia is currently experiencing attacks and outbreaks of the new invasive fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda. The S. frugiperda larvae emerge from the leaf midrib when eating, after hiding in the maize stalk so that it is difficult to control by contact. This study aimed to find out the endophytic fungi from the roots of maize, banana and chili in South Sumatra and to determine their pathogenicity against S. frugiperda larvae. The endophytic fungi were isolated from the plant roots. Fungal isolates proven to be endophytic wer e dropped (1 × 106 conidia mL−1) on the second instar larvae. The result showed that the endophytic fungi found were 8 isolates consisting of the genus, Aspergillus sp., Beauveria sp., Chaetomium sp., and Curvularia sp. First report of Aspergillus sp., Chaetomium sp., and Curvularia sp. have insecticidal activity against S. frugiperda larvae. However, the two most pathogenic isolates were JgCrJr and JgSPK isolates of Beauveria sp. with larval mortality of 29.33% and 26.67%, respectively, and could reduce the emergence of S. frugiperda adults up to 44%. So, the two isolates of Beauveria sp. have a high potential to be developed to control S. frugiperda larvae in maize both in the lowlands and the highlands. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

"Absence","Maize is one of the most important crops in the world, and ensuring its successful growth and productivity is crucial for global food security. One way to enhance maize growth and productivity is by improving the colonization of its roots by beneficial microorganisms. In this regard, Serendipita indica, a plant growth-promoting fungus, has gained attention for its ability to enhance plant growth and productivity, especially in cereal crops and medicinal plants. Previous studies have shown that S. indica can colonize various plant species, including maize, but the efficiency of the colonization process in maize seedlings has not been extensively characterized. This protocol outlines a method for efficient colonization of maize seedlings with the beneficial fungus S. indica. The protocol includes the preparation of stock solutions, maintenance and growth of S. indica, surface sterilization and germination of seeds, preparation of S. indica chlamydospores, and colonization of maize plants with S. indica. The advantages of this protocol include the use of surface sterilization techniques that minimize contamination, the production of a large number of viable chlamydospores, and efficient colonization of maize seedlings with S. indica. This protocol may be useful for researchers studying the role of S. indica in promoting plant growth and combating biotic and abiotic stress. Additionally, this protocol may be used in the development of biofertilizers using S. indica as a means of increasing crop yields and reducing dependence on synthetic fertilizers. Overall, this protocol offers a reliable and efficient method for colonizing maize seedlings with S. indica and may have potential applications in the agricultural industry. This study also provides a valuable tool for researchers interested in studying plant-microbe interactions in maize and highlights the potential of S. indica as a biocontrol agent to enhance maize productivity under adverse conditions.",5090,"Maize Seedlings Colonization with<i> Serendipita</i><i> indica</i> and Its Colonization Efficiency Analysis","Narayan, OP; Yadav, B; Verma, N; Dua, M; Johri, AK",NA,NA,NA,"Narayan, Om Prakash; Yadav, Bindu; Verma, Nidhi; Dua, Meenakshi; Johri, Atul Kumar",NA,NA,"BIO-PROTOCOL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yadav, Bindu/AAN-1166-2021; Narayan, Om Prakash/ABI-2493-2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2331-8325",NA,NA,NA,"OCT 20",2023,"13","20",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.21769/BioProtoc.4855","http://dx.doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4855",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37965269,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001104045600005",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,4914,0.304000464478163,0.695999535521837,"Absence","Absence",0.164578059473415,0.835421940526585,"Uncertain"
"Absence","Medicinal plants are a rich source of naturally occurring substances utilized in treating a wide range of diseases; as a result, they serve as the basis for discovering new drugs. Research has focused on the relationship between endophytic microorganisms and host plants, as they produce a variety of secondary metabolites with significant biological functions. This study aimed to extract the endophytic fungi from various plant parts, including the roots, barks, and leaves of the Cyathea contaminans (Hook) Copel, which was collected from Kerinci, Jambi, Indonesia. By employing direct planting and pouring techniques with fungal culture media, the fungi were separated from the roots, stems, hairs, and leaves of C. contaminans and grown on rice media. The secondary metabolite of the fungus was extracted using ethyl acetate. The extracts were then tested for antimicrobial activity using a disk diffusion assay against microbial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29213, Escherichia coli ATCC25922, and Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). This research yielded 19 endophyte fungi. In the antibacterial activity screening results, four fungal strains (CBK3, CDK1, CDK4, and CAK2) were active against S. aureus, MRSA, and E. coli, with an inhibition zone in the range of 15.08 ± 0.854 to 23.52 ± 0.87 mm. All active fungal isolates were identified molecularly. CBK3 and CDK1 were Paecilomyces subglobosus PP510226 and Penicillium citrinum PP510227, respectively, while CDK4 and CAK2 were comparable to Aspergillus terreus PP510229 and Aspergillus terreus PP510228. The four endophytic fungi of Cyathea contaminans may be a new source of antibacterial compounds. © 2024, Walailak University.

"Absence","Most fungi generate secondary metabolites essential to their growth or used as chemical defense systems. They produce a large variety of small molecules, notably alkaloids containing an isoindolinone unit in the form of small bicyclic cichorine-type molecules more or less substituted, up to the form of extended, heavily substituted tri- or tetra-cyclic molecules equipped with one or two prenyl side chains. An extended family of more than 170 isoindolinone derivatives produced by mycelial or endophytic fungi has been identified and analyzed. These isoindolinone derivatives include many series such as the andicichorines, aspergillinines, caputmedusins, clitocybins, daldinans, emerimidines, emeriphenolicins, entonalactams, erinaceolactams, erinacerins, fendlerinines, marilines, meyeroguillines, stachartins, stachybotrins, stachybotrysams, sterenins, xylactams, and others compounds endowed with pharmacological properties described here. The family also includes isoindolinone dimers, notably potent fibrinolytic compounds, such as those designated Stachybotrys microspora triprenyl phenol (SMTP) with the lead product SMTP-7 (orniplabin) currently developed for the treatment of stroke. The repertoire of isoindolinone-based natural products produced by fungi is large (in contrast that of vascular plants) and comprises products with marked anti-inflammatory, antiviral, or anticancer activities. All these fungal isoindolinone-based products can be exploited for their medicinal properties and to guide the design of functionalized analogues targeting different enzymes or pathways. The chemical or biosynthetic access to these products is evoked and the most potent derivatives are underlined. Altogether, the review offers an exhaustive repertoire of isoindolinones of fungal origin and their pharmacological properties.",5396,"Discovery and current developments of isoindolinone-based fungal natural products","Bailly, C",NA,NA,NA,"Bailly, Christian",NA,NA,"EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY REPORTS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bailly, Christian/V-4707-2019","BAILLY, Christian/0000-0002-2973-9357",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2772-4174",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2023,"9",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.ejmcr.2023.100112","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejmcr.2023.100112",NA,"SEP 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001072432800001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5209,0.136383823140321,0.863616176859679,"Absence","Uncertain",0.252567726540604,0.747432273459396,"Uncertain"
"Absence","Oxidative stress originates from an elevated intracellular level of free oxygen radicals that cause lipid peroxidation, protein denaturation, DNA hydroxylation, and apoptosis, ultimately impairing cell viability. Antioxidants scavenge free radicals and reduce oxidative stress, which further helps to prevent cellular damage. Medicinal plants, fruits, and spices are the primary sources of antioxidants from time immemorial. In contrast to plants, microorganisms can be used as a source of antioxidants with the advantage of fast growth under controlled conditions. Further, microbe-based antioxidants are nontoxic, noncarcinogenic, and biodegradable as compared to synthetic antioxidants. The present review aims to summarize the current state of the research on the antioxidant activity of microorganisms including actinomycetes, bacteria, fungi, protozoa, microalgae, and yeast, which produce a variety of antioxidant compounds, i.e., carotenoids, polyphenols, vitamins, and sterol, etc. Special emphasis is given to the mechanisms and signaling pathways followed by antioxidants to scavenge Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), especially for those antioxidant compounds that have been scarcely investigated so far.",5870,"Microorganisms: A Potential Source of Bioactive Molecules for Antioxidant Applications","Rani, A; Saini, KC; Bast, F; Mehariya, S; Bhatia, SK; Lavecchia, R; Zuorro, A",NA,NA,NA,"Rani, Alka; Saini, Khem Chand; Bast, Felix; Mehariya, Sanjeet; Bhatia, Shashi Kant; Lavecchia, Roberto; Zuorro, Antonio",NA,NA,"MOLECULES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mehariya, Sanjeet/L-6309-2019; Zuorro, Antonio/K-5144-2019; Bhatia, Shashi Kant/N-4550-2018","Bhatia, Shashi Kant/0000-0002-7688-6069; LAVECCHIA, Roberto/0000-0002-2998-7705; Mehariya, Sanjeet/0000-0003-1801-4702; Saini, Dr. Khem Chand/0000-0001-5768-6507; rani, alka/0000-0001-8181-111X; ZUORRO, Antonio/0000-0002-8173-3809",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1420-3049",NA,NA,NA,"FEB",2021,"26","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/molecules26041142","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules26041142",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33672774,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000624198600001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5673,0.182384734648663,0.817615265351337,"Absence","Absence",0.0795793198764861,0.920420680123514,"Absence"
"Absence","Plant pathogenic infections causing substantial global food losses are a persistent challenge. This study investigates a potential biocontrol strategy against the necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea using the endophytic fungus Sordaria tomento-alba isolated from Gliricidia sepium in Colombia. Today, synthetic fungicides dominate B. cinerea control, raising environmental and health concerns. S. tomento-alba exhibits notable in vitro effects, inhibiting B. cinerea growth by approximately 60% during co-culture and 50% in double disc co-culture. Additionally, it suppresses botryanes production and produces the compound heptacyclosordariolone, which has proven effective in inhibiting B. cinerea mycelial growth and spore germination in vitro. This biocontrol agent could be a potential eco-friendly alternative to replace synthetic fungicides. Our study provides insights into the chemical and biological mechanisms underpinning the antagonistic activity of S. tomento-alba, emphasizing the need for further research to understand its biosynthesis pathways and optimize its biocontrol potential. It also contributes molecular evidence of fungal interactions with implications for advanced forums in molecular studies in biology and chemistry, particularly in addressing plant pathogenic infections and promoting sustainable agriculture.",6263,"In Vitro Analysis of the Antagonistic Biological and Chemical Interactions between the Endophyte <i>Sordaria tomento</i>-<i>alba</i> and the Phytopathogen <i>Botrytis cinerea</i>","Bolívar-Anillo, HJ; Izquierdo-Bueno, I; González-Rey, E; González-Rodríguez, VE; Cantoral, JM; Collado, IG; Garrido, C",NA,NA,NA,"Bolivar-Anillo, Hernando Jose; Izquierdo-Bueno, Inmaculada; Gonzalez-Rey, Estrella; Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Victoria E.; Cantoral, Jesus M.; Collado, Isidro G.; Garrido, Carlos",NA,NA,"INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"del Carmen Garrido-Pérez, María/AAX-6328-2020; Gonzalez-Rodriguez, Victoria/AAT-3493-2020; Gonzalez Collado, Isidro/G-5501-2015; Cantoral, Jesus Manuel/N-1161-2014; Bolivar-Anillo, Hernando Jose/P-9178-2016; Garrido, Carlos/L-1339-2014; Izquierdo Bueno Reina, Inmaculada Concepcion/H-9468-2015","Gonzalez Collado, Isidro/0000-0002-8612-0593; Cantoral, Jesus Manuel/0000-0003-3019-4144; Bolivar-Anillo, Hernando Jose/0000-0002-4268-3781; Garrido, Carlos/0000-0001-9150-6119; Izquierdo Bueno Reina, Inmaculada Concepcion/0000-0001-8861-408X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1661-6596","1422-0067",NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2024,"25","2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/ijms25021022","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms25021022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38256097,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001153097900001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6059,0.206381314353561,0.793618685646439,"Absence","Absence",0.00450359163847169,0.995496408361528,"Absence"
"Absence","Plants harbor a large reservoir of fungal diversity, encompassing endophytic, epiphytic, phytopathogenic, and rhizosphere-associated fungi. Despite this diversity, relatively few fungal species have been characterized as sources of bioactive secondary metabolites. The role of secondary metabolites is still not fully understood; however, it is suggested that these metabolites play important roles in defense mechanisms and fungal interactions with other organisms. Hence, fungal secondary metabolites have potential biotechnological applications as prototype molecules for the development of therapeutic drugs. In this chapter, we describe the main methods used for routine fungi isolation, production of crude fungal extracts, and chemical characterization of bioactive compounds. In addition, explicative notes about the steps described are provided to explore the diversity of the endophytic, phytopathogenic, epiphytic, and rhizosphere fungi and to evaluate the biotechnological potential of each group.",6398,"Plant-associated Fungi: Methods for Taxonomy, Diversity, and Bioactive Secondary Metabolite Bioprospecting","Ferreira, MC; de Carvalho, CR; Bahia, M; Barreto, DLC; Azevedo, RN; Cota, BB; Zani, CL; Santos, ARD; Rosa, CA; Rosa, LH",NA,"Carvalhais, LC; Dennis, PG",NA,"Ferreira, Mariana Costa; de Carvalho, Camila Rodrigues; Bahia, Marina; Costa Barreto, Debora Luiza; Azevedo, Rafaela Nogueira; Cota, Betania Barros; Zani, Carlos Leomar; de Oliveira Santos, Ana Raquel; Rosa, Carlos Augusto; Rosa, Luiz Henrique",NA,NA,"PLANT MICROBIOME: Methods and Protocols","Methods in Molecular Biology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cota, Betania/AAO-2753-2021; de Menezes, marina/AFH-3306-2022; Zani, Carlos/ABE-3936-2021","Rosa, Carlos/0000-0002-0056-9075",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1064-3745","1940-6029","978-1-0716-1040-4; 978-1-0716-1039-8",NA,NA,NA,2021,"2232",NA,NA,NA,NA,"85","112","10.1007/978-1-0716-1040-4_9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-1040-4_9","10.1007/978-1-0716-1040-4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33161542,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000680092300010",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6185,0.359051295033343,0.640948704966657,"Absence","Uncertain",0.219369724695191,0.780630275304809,"Uncertain"
"Absence","Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most emerging multidrug-resistant opportunistic pathogens, which poses a threat to immunocompromised patients. Treatment of P. aeruginosa in the affected patients has become difficult because of its ability to develop resistant strains against most of the conventional therapeutic antibiotics. Quorum sensing plays a crucial role in the virulence nature of P. aeruginosa as it helps the bacteria to produce virulence factors and biofilm formation. In the present study, we studied the quorum quenching potential of fungal secondary metabolites from the well-known fungus Phoma multirostrata PUTY3 strain isolated from Carica papaya. In this study, we have carried out both in-vitro and in-silico analyses of fungal secondary metabolites from P. multrirostrata against P. aeruginasa. The in-vitro analysis showed a marked decrease in the production of virulence factors such as pyocyanin, rhamnolipids, protease, elastase, exopolysaccharides, HCN gas production and biofilm formation. In addition to this, a significant inhibition in the motility factors of P. aeruginosa such as swimming, swarming, twitching was also observed. In-silico studies further validated the results, in which, docking of molecules, present in the GCMS analysis of fungal secondary metabolites, were carried out with the two main quorum sensing regulating proteins, viz., LasR and RhlR. These findings indicate a new anti-infective and alternative therapeutic approaches to combat the virulence factors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and explore further the potential of fungal secondary metabolites from other saprophytic fungi colonizing decaying substrata of medicinal plants.",6566,"ATTENUATION OF QUORUM SENSING ASSOCIATED VIRULENCE FACTORS AND BIOFILM FORMATION IN <i>PSEUDOMONAS</i> <i>AERUGINOSA</i> PAO1 BY <i>PHOMA</i> <i>MULTI</i>-<i>ROSTRATA</i> PUTY3, A SAPROPHYTIC FUNGUS, ISOLATED FROM <i>CARICA PAPAYA</i>","Ahmed, T; Sarma, VV",NA,NA,NA,"Ahmed, Tanveer; Sarma, V.

"Absence","Purpose This study aimed at elucidating the biotic components of crop decline affecting kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) orchards. Methods The study was carried out on soil samples originating from an over twenty-year-old orchard showing typical yield decline (Old), one in full production phase (Adult), one fallow after a kiwifruit cultivation (Fallow), an abandoned one (Virgin). Soil health of those soil samples was assessed with an in-pot growth assay using kiwifruit plantlets in which root endophytic fungi and rhizosphere bacteria communities were assessed using qPCR and NGS analysis. Results Plant growth in the Old field was significantly lower than the others, in line with the crop decline of that field. The Old treatment differed from the others in the following soil features: i. a great reduction of total bacteria, Pseudomonas, actinomycetes and Bacillus compared to the Adult orchard; ii. a significant increase of Nitrosospira and other nitrifying bacteria which persisted in kiwifruit rhizosphere even under the optimal conditions; iii. a reduction of potentially beneficial genera among which Massilia, Rubrobacter and Kaistobacter. Old, Adult and Fallow were similar in root fungal community composition, with Dactylonectria as dominant genus (about 50%); whilst in the Virgin prevailed saprophytic non-pathogenic fungi. Conclusions Bacterial communities in over-30-year-old kiwifruit orchards were greatly reduced and modified, thus suggesting being a cause of the reduced ability of soil to support plant growth. In addition, kiwifruit manifested a legacy effect on soilborne fungal communities, including root endophytes.",6580,"Quantitative reduction of soil bacteria and qualitative microbial changes: biotic components associated to kiwifruit decline","Manici, LM; Saccà, ML; Scotti, C; Caputo, F",NA,NA,NA,"Manici, Luisa Maria; Sacca, Maria Ludovica; Scotti, Carla; Caputo, Francesco",NA,NA,"PLANT AND SOIL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Manici, Luisa/AAW-9008-2021; Sacca', Maria Ludovica/Q-9562-2019","Sacca, Maria Ludovica/0000-0003-4222-9527; Manici, Luisa M./0000-0003-2798-4428",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0032-079X","1573-5036",NA,NA,NA,"AUG",2022,"477","1-2",NA,"SI",NA,"613","628","10.1007/s11104-022-05470-w","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-022-05470-w",NA,"MAY 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000789812200002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,6354,0.0250189819288864,0.974981018071114,"Absence","Absence",0.0467949261281856,0.953205073871814,"Absence"

Yet, despite the exponential growth of this topic, a whole outline to reflect the relevance and extent of each study type is missing. Hence, we performed an analysis of all available literature to expose the characteristics and limitations of this research field. Our results suggested that, overall, there is still a tendency to study the most known models in plant-fungal-stress combinations (ascomycetous fungi, grasses, abiotic stress). Fungal endophytes in dicot plants or against biotic stress, though promising, are still quite unexplored.

"Absence","Soil pollution with organic contaminants is one of the most intractable environmental problems today, posing serious threats to humans and the environment. Innovative strategies for remediating organic-contaminated soils are critically needed. Phytoremediation, based on the synergistic actions of plants and their associated microorganisms, has been recognized as a powerful in situ approach to soil remediation. Suitable combinations of plants and their associated endophytes can improve plant growth and enhance the biodegradation of organic contaminants in the rhizosphere and/or endosphere, dramatically expediting the removal of organic pollutants from soils. However, for phytoremediation to become a more widely accepted and predictable alternative, a thorough understanding of plant–endophyte interactions is needed. Many studies have recently been conducted on the mechanisms of endophyte-assisted phytoremediation of organic contaminants in soils. In this review, we highlight the superiority of organic pollutant-degrading endophytes for practical applications in phytoremediation, summarize alternative strategies for improving phytoremediation, discuss the fundamental mechanisms of endophyte-assisted phytoremediation, and present updated information regarding the advances, challenges, and new directions in the field of endophyte-assisted phytoremediation technology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",7052,"Efficient phytoremediation of organic contaminants in soils using plant–endophyte partnerships","Feng N.-X.; Yu J.; Zhao H.-M.; Cheng Y.-T.; Mo C.-H.; Cai Q.-Y.; Li Y.-W.; Li H.; Wong M.-H.",NA,"",NA,"Feng, Nai-Xian (56814373400); Yu, Jiao (57192990512); Zhao, Hai-Ming (57218546873); Cheng, Yu-Ting (58835453300); Mo, Ce-Hui (55608345800); Cai, Quan-Ying (16041741600); Li, Yan-Wen (36079184400); Li, Hui (57060874400); Wong, Ming-Hung (57204925649)",NA,NA,"Science of the Total Environment",NA,NA,"English","","","","",NA,"Co-metabolism; Endophyte; Omics; Organic contaminated soil; Phytoremediation","Biodegradation, Environmental; Endophytes; Plant Development; Plants; Rhizosphere; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Biodegradation; Bioremediation; Contamination; Organic pollutants; Soil conservation; Soil pollution control; Soils; biosurfactant; Co metabolisms; Contaminated soils; Endophyte; Omics; Phytoremediation; biodegradation; endophyte; metabolism; organic pollutant; phytoremediation; rhizosphere; soil pollution; soil remediation; biotechnology; detoxification; DNA modification; endophytic fungus; enzyme activity; fungal colonization; fungal metabolism; gene expression; gene number; genetic engineering; nonhuman; organic pollution; phytoremediation; plant fungus interaction; plant gene; plant growth; plant metabolism; plant physiology; prediction; Review; rhizosphere; soil pollutant; soil pollution; survival; symbiosis; transgenic plant; waste component removal; analysis; bioremediation; chemistry; endophyte; metabolism; plant; plant development; soil; Soil pollution","Guangdong Provincial Research Center for Environment Pollution Control and Remediation Materials, School of Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China; Consortium on Health, Environment, Education and Research (CHEER), Department of Science and Environmental Studies, The Education University of Hong Kong, Tai Po, Hong Kong","Feng N.-X., Guangdong Provincial Research Center for Environment Pollution Control and Remediation Materials, School of Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China; Yu J., Guangdong Provincial Research Center for Environment Pollution Control and Remediation Materials, School of Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China; Zhao H.-M., Guangdong Provincial Research Center for Environment Pollution Control and Remediation Materials, School of Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China; Cheng Y.-T., Guangdong Provincial Research Center for Environment Pollution Control and Remediation Materials, School of Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China; Mo C.-H., Guangdong Provincial Research Center for Environment Pollution Control and Remediation Materials, School of Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China; Cai Q.-Y., Guangdong Provincial Research Center for Environment Pollution Control and Remediation Materials, School of Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China; Li Y.-W., Guangdong Provincial Research Center for Environment Pollution Control and Remediation Materials, School of Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China; Li H., Guangdong Provincial Research Center for Environment Pollution Control and Remediation Materials, School of Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China; Wong M.-H., Guangdong Provincial Research Center for Environment Pollution Control and Remediation Materials, School of Environment, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China, Consortium on Health, Environment, Education and Research (CHEER), Department of Science and Environmental Studies, The Education University of Hong Kong, Tai Po, Hong Kong","C.-H.

"Absence","Some microbiome components can provide functions that extend the capabilities of plants, increasing the environmental adaptability and performance of holobionts. Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa is a perennial grass adapted to rocky sea cliffs, where soil and nutrients are very limited, and exposure to salinity is continuous. This study aimed to investigate if a Diaporthe fungal endophyte belonging to the core microbiome of Festuca rubra roots could improve the performance of two agricultural grasses. In a greenhouse experiment, plants of tritordeum (Triticum durum x Hordeum chilense) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) were inoculated with Diaporthe strain EB4 and subjected to two salinity conditions (0 and 200 mM NaCl). Biomass production, mineral elements, proline, hormone profiles, antioxidant capacity, and total phenolic compounds were examined in plants, and fungal functions potentially related to the promotion of plant growth were determined. The inoculation with Diaporthe promoted plant growth of both grasses, increasing leaf biomass (84% in tritordeum and 29% in perennial ryegrass), root biomass, nutrient content (N, Ca, Mg, and Fe), and the production of indole 3-acetic acid, regardless of the salinity treatment. Improved growth and nutrient uptake might occur because Diaporthe produces several extracellular enzymes capable of recycling organic nutrient pools. In addition, the fungus produced indole 3-acetic acid in vitro and modulated the production of this phytohormone in the plant. Under salinity, the activity of Diaporthe ameliorated the stress, increasing proline, nutrient uptake in roots, gibberellins, and indole 3-acetic acid, which in turn results into improved growth. Thus, this fungus can transfer to alternative hosts some advantages useful at its original habitat.",7090,"A <i>Diaporthe</i> Fungal Endophyte From a Wild Grass Improves Growth and Salinity Tolerance of Tritordeum and Perennial Ryegrass","Toghueo, RMK; Zabalgogeazcoa, I; Pereira, EC; de Aldana, BVR",NA,NA,NA,"Toghueo, Rufin M.

"Absence","The biological synthesis of silver nanoparticles offers a promising alternative to traditional physical and chemical methods due to its inherent simplicity, non-toxic nature, and environmental friendliness. Within this study, endophytic fungi hosted six wild plants in Arish City, North Sinai, Egypt have been isolated by surface sterilization technique on different isolation media. Twelve species, based on their frequency of occurrence, out of thirty recovered taxa were tested for their capability to synthesize extracellular AgNPs. Aspergillus terreus (OQ119631) and Aspergillus flavus (OQ119633) recovered from Hyoscyamus muticus and Zygophyllum album respectively were found to be the best candidate for the production of mycogenic AgNPs among all examined species. Mycogenic AgNPs were characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy for both taxa. The synthesized silver nanoparticles demonstrated antimicrobial efficacy against various pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Additionally, their cytotoxicity was assessed against the human normal fibroblast cell line (BJ) using a cell viability assay. The results revealed substantial growth inhibition with IC50 concentration of 100 µg/mL, indicating effectiveness against diseased cells while maintaining relative safety towards healthy cells. This underscores the potential of eco-friendly AgNPs produced by native endophytic fungi for targeted cytotoxicity. © 2024, Arab Society for Fungal Conservation.

"Absence","The focus of plant health management is shifting from synthetic chemicals to bio-agents, and endophytes are beneficial for this purpose. In the present study, we isolated eleven endophytic fungi from seven wild rice species. Independent treatment of endophytic fungi in rice showed significant improvements in plant growth, higher tillering and percent fertility, panicle number/hill and filled grain number in endophyte-inoculated plants compared to control plants. Growth promotion activities of two endophytes Curvularia lunata (NRRI EF-11) and Hypocreals sp. (NRRI EF-8) were recorded with increased rice yield. These isolates also exhibited higher plant growth promoting chemicals namely, Indole acetic acid (IAA) and Inorganic phosphate (IP) which was realised into better growth promotion in rice. The biocontrol efficacy of endophytic fungi was highest in NRRI EF-11among all isolates as indicated by inhibition of radial growth of pathogens by 76.98-77.06% and in NRRI EF-8 by 74.81-76.61%, which is due to higher production of prussic acid. Defense induction was confirmed by analyzing the expression of catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) defense enzymes, where expression of CAT, POD and SOD increased by 19.44-25.86, 2.70-3.16, 11.14-12.95 Units g(-1) in treated NRRI EF-11 plants and 18.39-25.84, 2.16-2.94, 10.96-12.62 Units g(-1) in treated NRRI EF-8 plants, respectively.

These Ag/Ag2O NPs were fabricated from silver oxide micro powder using endophytic fungus Fusarium oxysporum based environmentally friendly, bio-inspired, top-down approach which is highly reproducible, reliable, and cheap. Bacterial and plant-mediated bottom-up approaches have been previously reported for the production of Ag/Ag2O NPs. Bacterial methods are not economical as they require expensive sophisticated instruments for separation and purification. Similarly, plant-based means of synthesis are not reliable and reproducible due to geographical and seasonal variability's. UV-Visible spectroscopy, TEM, SAED, FTIR, XRD, TGA, and DSC were used for the characterization and investigation of thermal properties of mycogenic nanoparticles and their antimicrobial activity was evaluated by filter- paper bioassay technique.",8437,"Application of mycogenic silver/silver oxide nanoparticles in electrochemical glucose sensing; alongside their catalytic and antimicrobial activity","Islam, SN; Naqvi, SMA; Parveen, S; Ahmad, A",NA,NA,NA,"Islam, Sk Najrul; Naqvi, Syed Mohd Adnan; Parveen, Sadia; Ahmad, Absar",NA,NA,"3 BIOTECH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Islam, Sk/HGC-1725-2022","ISLAM, SK NAJRUL/0000-0002-7167-4569",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2190-572X","2190-5738",NA,NA,NA,"JUL",2021,"11","7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1007/s13205-021-02888-4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-021-02888-4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34221813,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000691438000001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8166,0.194303826054445,0.805696173945555,"Uncertain","Uncertain",0.455670810360794,0.544329189639206,"Uncertain"
"Absence","The world faces two enormous challenges that can be met, at least in part and at low cost, by making certain changes in agricultural practices. There is need to produce enough food and fibre for a growing population in the face of adverse climatic trends, and to remove greenhouse gases to avert the worst consequences of global climate change. Improving photosynthetic efficiency of crop plants can help meet both challenges. Fortuitously, when crop plants' roots are colonized by certain root endophytic fungi in the genus Trichoderma, this induces up-regulation of genes and pigments that improve the plants' photosynthesis. Plants under physiological or environmental stress suffer losses in their photosynthetic capability through damage to photosystems and other cellular processes caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). But certain Trichoderma strains activate biochemical pathways that reduce ROS to less harmful molecules. This and other mechanisms described here make plants more resistant to biotic and abiotic stresses. The net effect of these fungi's residence in plants is to induce greater shoot and root growth, increasing crop yields, which will raise future food production. Furthermore, if photosynthesis rates are increased, more CO2 will be extracted from the atmosphere, and enhanced plant root growth means that more sequestered C will be transferred to roots and stored in the soil. Reductions in global greenhouse gas levels can be accelerated by giving incentives for climate-friendly carbon farming and carbon cap-and-trade programmes that reward practices transferring carbon from the atmosphere into the soil, also enhancing soil fertility and agricultural production.",8702,"Endophytic strains of <i>Trichoderma</i> increase plants' photosynthetic capability","Harman, GE; Doni, F; Khadka, RB; Uphoff, N",NA,NA,NA,"Harman, G.

"Absence","This study identifies the potential role in heat-stress mitigation of phytohormones and other secondary metabolites produced by the endophytic fungus Paecilomyces formosus LWL1 in japonica rice cultivar Dongjin. The japonica rice was grown in controlled chamber conditions with and without P. formosus LWL1 under no stress (NS) and prolonged heat stress (HS) conditions. Endophytic association under NS and HS conditions significantly improved plant growth attributes, such as plant height, fresh weight, dry weight, and chlorophyll content. Furthermore, P. formosus LWL1 protected the rice plants from HS compared with controls, indicated by the lower endogenous level of stress-signaling compounds such as abscisic acid (25.71%) and jasmonic acid (34.57%) and the increase in total protein content (18.76%-33.22%).

"Absence","To discover microorganisms that naturally possess chemical weapons against the phytopathogen Fusarium oxysporum, the biological and chemical diversity of plant leaf endophytes was investigated. Endophytes were isolated from the palm tree Astrocaryum sciophyllum collected in pristine forests of French Guiana. Several Xylariaceae inhibited the growth of F. oxysporum and were further explored. Antifungal specialized metabolites were isolated from the Xylariaceae BSNB-0294 strain in confrontation with the phytopathogen and led to the identification of undescribed compounds, i.e., two depsipeptides named xylariaceins, two metabolites containing a 3-imidazolinone moiety, and four new compounds including a nitro-phenylpropanamide and three phenylalanine analogues named xylariains A-D. In parallel, the chemical investigation of the phytopathogen during the coculture led to the identification of an unknown compound, which we named focicin. The production of focicin was exacerbated during the competition. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization coupled to time-of-flight mass spectometry (MALDI-TOF MS) imaging of the competition between BSNB-0294 (endophytic strain) and F. oxysporum f.sp. ciceris (phytopathogen) highlighted time-dependent chemical interactions between the two microorganisms.",9107,"Identification of Antagonistic Compounds between the Palm Tree Xylariale Endophytic Fungi and the Phytopathogen <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i>","Barthélemy, M; Elie, N; Genta-Jouve, G; Stien, D; Touboul, D; Eparvier, V",NA,NA,NA,"Barthelemy, Morgane; Elie, Nicolas; Genta-Jouve, Gregory; Stien, Didier; Touboul, David; Eparvier, Veronique",NA,NA,"JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Eparvier, Véronique/AFQ-3903-2022; Genta-Jouve, Gregory/I-7680-2012; Touboul, David/LKL-5514-2024; Genta-Jouve, Gregory/E-9896-2014; Elie, Nicolas/M-7499-2015","Genta-Jouve, Gregory/0000-0002-9239-4371; Touboul, David/0000-0003-2751-774X; Eparvier, Veronique/0000-0002-2954-0866; Elie, Nicolas/0000-0002-8733-0971; Stien, Didier/0000-0002-9950-5361",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0021-8561","1520-5118",NA,NA,NA,"SEP 22",2021,"69","37",NA,NA,NA,"10893","10906","10.1021/acs.jafc.1c03141","http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jafc.1c03141",NA,"SEP 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34516124,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000700883500013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,8822,0.00971549816166284,0.990284501838337,"Absence","Absence",0.0676978717352232,0.932302128264777,"Absence"
