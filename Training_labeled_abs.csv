"3","Presence","A study was conducted for isolation, identification and antibacterial potential of fungal endophytes of Adenocalymma alliaceum Miers., (Bignoniaceae), a medicinal shrub vine plant which has long history for its usages in curing various disorders. A total of 149 isolates of endophytic fungi representing 17 fungal taxa were obtained from 270 segments (90 from each stem, leaf and petiole) of this plant. Hyphomycetes (77.85%) were the most prevalent, followed by Ascomycetes (8.05%) and Coelomycetes (4.03%) respectively. A considerable amount of fungal isolates was kept under (10.07%) Mycelia-Sterilia (MS). Leaf harboured maximum colonization of endophytic fungi (72.22%) which was greater than stem (67.78%) and petiole (25.54%). The Jc similarity index was maximum (0.619) between stem vs leaf followed by leaf vs petiole (0.571) and stem vs petiole (0.428). The dominant endophytic fungi were Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Stenella agalis, Fusarium oxysporum, Curvularia lunata and Fusarium roseum. Among twelve endophytic fungi tested for antibacterial activity, crude extracts of nine endophytic fungi (75%), showed antibacterial potential against one or more clinical human pathogens. Alternaria alternata, Curvularia lunata, Penicillium sp. and Chaetomium globosum exhibited significant antibacterial activity against 4 of 5 tested pathogens, showing broad spectrum activity. This investigation explains the value of sampling from different tissues of a host plant for the greater species diversity, and additionally, the antibacterial screening of some endophytic fungi from this specific medicinal plant may represent a unique source for many of the useful antibacterial compounds.","J","Kharwar, RN; Verma, SK; Mishra, A; Gond, SK; Sharma, VK; Afreen, T; Kumar, A",NA,NA,NA,"Kharwar, Ravindra N.; Verma, Satish K.; Mishra, Ashish; Gond, Surendra K.; Sharma, Vijay K.; Afreen, Talat; Kumar, Anuj",NA,NA,"Assessment of diversity, distribution and antibacterial activity of endophytic fungi isolated from a medicinal plant Adenocalymma alliaceum Miers","SYMBIOSIS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sharma, Vijay Kumar K/E-3541-2019; Gond, Surendra/ABB-6182-2021; Sharma, Vijay Kumar/J-5353-2019; Verma, Satish K./J-6398-2019","Sharma, Vijay Kumar K/0000-0002-2330-5830; Verma, Satish Kumar/0000-0003-4470-5398; Gond, Surendra/0000-0002-2737-9028; Afreen, Talat/0000-0003-3801-403X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0334-5114","1878-7665",NA,NA,NA,"AUG",2011,55,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"39","46",NA,"10.1007/s13199-011-0142-2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-011-0142-2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000298499300005","View Full Record in Web of Science",3,NA
"4","Presence","The manner in which fungal endophytes activate host stress response systems is unknown; the occurrence of additional mechanisms involved in symbiotically-conferred stress tolerance in mangrove plants (the primary producers of estuarine food chain) is also an unresolved issue. Here, we report antioxidant potentials of four different mangroves and their endophytic fungi. We elucidated the possible roles of antioxidants in symbiotic association between mangroves and their endophytic fungi. Four different mangrove species and the predominant endophytic fungus Aspergillus flavus were analyzed using various in vitro assay systems (such as iron chelating capacity, reducing power, and hydroxyl radicals/hydrogen peroxide/1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging and inhibition of lipid peroxidation using the beta-carotene-linoleate model system). In vitro models clearly established the antioxidant potency of extracts of mangrove plants and their respective endophytic fungi, which aids in understanding the mutualistic associations of plant and endophyte against various biotic and abiotic stresses. Re-infection analysis of endophytic A. flavus in tobacco plants confirmed the endophytic status of the fungus and its enhancement effect on plant growth.","J","Ravindran, C; Naveenan, T; Varatharajan, GR; Rajasabapathy, R; Meena, RM",NA,NA,NA,"Ravindran, Chinnarajan; Naveenan, Thangaiah; Varatharajan, Govindaswamy R.; Rajasabapathy, Raju; Meena, Ram Murthi",NA,NA,"Antioxidants in mangrove plants and endophytic fungal associations","BOTANICA MARINA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rajasabapathy, Raju/HHN-6549-2022","Rajasabapathy, Raju/0000-0002-0304-870X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0006-8055","1437-4323",NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2012,55,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"269","279",NA,"10.1515/bot-2011-0095","http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/bot-2011-0095",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000306458300008","View Full Record in Web of Science",4,NA
"5","Review","The purpose of this systematic review was to identify the available literature of production, purification, and characterization of proteases by endophytic fungi. There are few complete studies that entirely exhibit the production, characterization, and purification of proteases from endophytic fungi. This study followed the PRISMA, and the search was conducted on five databases: PubMed, PMC, Science Direct, Scopus Articles, and Web of Science up until 18 May 2021, with no time or language restrictions. The methodology of the selected studies was evaluated using GRADE. Protease production, optimization, purification, and characterization were the main evaluated outcomes. Of the 5540 initially gathered studies, 15 met the inclusion criteria after a two-step selection process. Only two studies optimized the protease production using statistical design and two reported enzyme purification and characterization. The genus Penicillium and Aspergillus were the most cited among the eleven different genera of endophytic fungi evaluated in the selected articles. Six studies proved the ability of some endophytic fungi to produce fibrinolytic proteases, demonstrating that endophytic fungi can be exploited for the further production of agents used in thrombolytic therapy. However, further characterization and physicochemical studies are required to evaluate the real potential of endophytic fungi as sources of industrial enzymes.","J","Bezerra, VHS; Cardoso, SL; Fonseca-Bazzo, Y; Silveira, D; Magalhaes, PO; Souza, PM",NA,NA,NA,"Bezerra, Victor Hugo Souto; Cardoso, Samuel Leite; Fonseca-Bazzo, Yris; Silveira, Damaris; Magalhaes, Perola Oliveira; Souza, Paula Monteiro",NA,NA,"Protease Produced by Endophytic Fungi: A Systematic Review","MOLECULES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Silveira, Damaris/A-1942-2008; MAGALHÃES, PÉROLA/P-3378-2018; Souza, Paula/AAE-5731-2021","Silveira, Damaris/0000-0003-1851-5224; MAGALHÃES, PÉROLA/0000-0001-8011-6940; Souza, Paula/0000-0003-1824-2211; Fonseca, Yris/0000-0002-1230-3207",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1420-3049",NA,NA,NA,"NOV",2021,26,"22",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7062","10.3390/molecules26227062","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules26227062",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34834154,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000723631600001","View Full Record in Web of Science",6,NA
"6","Presence","The dried tuber of Alisma orientale (Sam.) Juzep. (AOJ) is a traditional Chinese medicine with high medicinal value. The endophytic fungi of medicinal plants are a treasure house of natural compounds. However, there is a lack of research on the diversity and biological activity of endophytic fungi of AOJ. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to study the diversity of endophytic fungi in the roots and stems of AOJ, and endophytic fungi with a high output of phenols and flavonoids were screened by chromogenic reaction, and the antioxidant and antibacterial activities and chemical constituents of crude extracts of their fermentation broth were studied. A total of 3,426 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to 9 phyla, 27 classes, 64 orders, 152 families, and 277 genera were identified from AOJ. There were significant differences in the endophytic fungal communities of AOJ roots and stems, as well as in the endophytic fungal communities of triangular AOJ and circular AOJ. In addition, 31 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated from AOJ, of which 6 strains had good antioxidant and antibacterial activities. The crude extract of YG-2 had the strongest free radical scavenging ability and bacteriostatic ability, and its IC50 (DPPH), IC50 (ABTS), and IC50.OH values were 0.009 +/- 0.000 mg/mL, 0.023 +/- 0.002 mg/mL, and 0.081 +/- 0.006 mg/mL, respectively. The results of LC-MS showed that the main component of the crude extract of YG-2 was caffeic acid (10.12 mu mol/g). Overall, the results of this study preliminarily elucidated the diversity and community composition of endophytic fungi of AOJ, indicating that AOJ endophytic fungi have abundant secondary metabolites and good antioxidant and antibacterial activities. This study provides an important reference for further research, development and utilization of AOJ endophytic fungi and a theoretical basis for the further development of the endophytic fungus YG-2 (Chaetomium globosum) as a source of antioxidants.","J","Shen, NY; Chen, Z; Cheng, GX; Lin, WJ; Qin, YH; Xiao, YR; Chen, H; Tang, ZZ; Li, QF; Yuan, M; Bu, TL",NA,NA,NA,"Shen, Nayu; Chen, Zhao; Cheng, GuiXin; Lin, Wenjie; Qin, Yihan; Xiao, Yirong; Chen, Hui; Tang, Zizhong; Li, Qingfeng; Yuan, Ming; Bu, Tongliang",NA,NA,"Diversity, chemical constituents and biological activities of endophytic fungi from Alisma orientale (Sam.)

Fungal endophytes have the capacity to produce bioactive compounds and can independently synthesize secondary metabolites similar to those made by the host plants. Optimization of the fermentation culture is one of the most important strategies in increasing taxol production by endophytic fungi supplemented with several substances including carbon sources, nitrogen sources, precursors, inducer and the metabolic bypass inhibitors. Improved fermentation techniques and different biotechnological strategies such as gene cloning, gene transformation, mutations are widely being used on endophytic fungi in order to increase the productivity of the taxol.

Many of these anticancer compounds, such as paclitaxel, camptothecin, vinblastine, vincristine, podophyllotoxin, and their derivatives, are currently being used clinically for the treatment of various cancers (e.g., ovarian, breast, prostate, lung cancers, and leukemias). By increasing the yield of specific compounds with genetic engineering and other biotechnologies, endophytic fungi could be a promising, prolific source of anticancer drugs. In the future, compounds derived from endophytic fungi could increase treatment availability and cost effectiveness. This comprehensive review includes the putative anticancer compounds from plant-derived endophytic fungi discovered from 1990 to 2020 with their source endophytic fungi and host plants as well as their antitumor activity against various cell lines.","J","Hridoy, M; Gorapi, MZH; Noor, S; Chowdhury, NS; Rahman, MM; Muscari, I; Masia, F; Adorisio, S; Delfino, DV; Mazid, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Hridoy, Md.; Gorapi, Md.

Three thousand and nine-hundred leaf segments from 10 different hosts belonging to seven families, Rhizophoraceae (Rhizophora apiculata, R. mucronata, Ceriops decandra), Sonneratiaceae (Sonneratia alba), Combretaceae (Lumnitzera littorea), Avicenniaceae (Avicennia alba), Acanthaceae (Acanthus ilicifolius), Meliaceae (Xylocarpus granatum and Xylocarpus moluccensis) and Malvaceae (Thespesia populneoides), were screened for the presence of fungal endophytes. The dominant endophytes varied by host type. Phyllosticta was the most frequently isolated fungus from plants at all sites. The common fungal endophyte genera were Cladosporium, Colletotrichum, Phomopsis and Xylaria. Most endophytic isolates in mangrove leaves were recovered from Ranong Province. The antimicrobial potential of 71 endophytic fungi isolated from mangrove plants towards selected bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) was tested using ethyl acetate extracts of fungi cultivated under static conditions. All test bacteria were inhibited by a Cladosporium sp. isolated from the leaves of T. populneoides and an endophytic Xylaria sp. 1 isolated from A. ilicifolius leaves caused considerable inhibition to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Additionally, the crude extracts of 84 endophytic fungi were tested for anticancer activities by the MTT assay against A375 (human malignant melanoma), SW620 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma), Kato III (human gastric carcinoma), HepG2 (human liver hepatoblastoma) and Jurkat (human acute T cell leukemia).

"18","Review","Endophytic fungi are a highly diverse group of fungi that intermittently colonize all plants without causing symptoms of the disease. They sense and respond to physiological and environmental changes of their host plant and microbiome. The inter-organism interactions are largely driven by chemical networks mediated by specialized metabolites. The balance of these complex interactions leads to healthy and strong host plants. Endophytic strains have particular machinery to produce a plethora of secondary metabolites with a variety of bioactivities and unknown functions in an ecological niche. Terpenoids play a key role in endophytism and represent an important source of bioactive molecules for human health and agriculture. In this review, we describe the role of endophytic fungi in plant health, fungal terpenoids in multiple interactions, and bioactive fungal terpenoids recently reported from endophytes, mainly from plants used in traditional medicine, as well as from algae and mangroves. Additionally, we highlight endophytic fungi as producers of important chemotherapeutic terpenoids, initially discovered in plants. Despite advances in understanding endophytism, we still have much to learn in this field. The study of the role, the evolution of interactions of endophytic fungi and their terpenoids provide an opportunity for better applications in human health and agriculture.","J","Galindo-Solis, JM; Fernandez, FJ",NA,NA,NA,"Galindo-Solis, Juan M.; Fernandez, Francisco J.",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungal Terpenoids: Natural Role and Bioactivities","MICROORGANISMS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Fernandez, Francisco/L-3320-2015; GALINDO SOLIS, J.

"20","Presence","Key message The endophytic fungus strain TH15 isolated from root of T. hemsleyanum secrets zearalenone and phytohormones (IAA, JA and SA), which have the effect on regulating root development of T. hemsleyanum. Tetrastigma hemsleyanum is a traditional Chinese herb plant. The endophytic fungus strain TH15 isolated from root of T. hemsleyanum has been reported to significantly promote the growth of T. hemsleyanum. In this study, we combined HPLC-MS and ELISA to analyze the composition of TH15's fermentation broth. We also explored the effects of zearalenone, a metabolite of strain TH15, on the growth of T. hemsleyanum seedlings and expansin gene expression in root. Metabolomic analysis revealed that TH15 metabolites contained 5 phytohormones [indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), methyl indole-3-acetate (MeIAA), jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (JA-ILE) and salicylic acid (SA)], amino acids, sugar and vitamins. ELISA test indicated that TH15 metabolites contained zearalenone (ZEN). Supplement 0.1-0.5 mg/L ZEN into the culture medium promoted the growth of seedlings of T. hemsleyanum. Besides, ZEN treatment significantly promoted expression of the expansin gene in the root of T. hemsleyanum. The endophytic fungus strain TH15 secretes phytohormones like IAA, JA and SA, as well as other metabolites like ZEN. TH15's growth-promoting effects are realized by these secreted molecules' coordinated action. The endophytic fungal metabolite ZEN participates in the regulation of T. hemsleyanum's growth, which is an important molecular mechanism for the plant growth-promoting effects of the endophytic fungi strain TH15.","J","Wang, LZ; Huang, XP; Li, JS; Huang, JX; Bao, SY; He, CJ; Zhang, MM; Xiang, TH",NA,NA,NA,"Wang, Leizhen; Huang, Xiaoping; Li, Jiangshan; Huang, Jinxin; Bao, Shuying; He, Chenjin; Zhang, Mengmeng; Xiang, Taihe",NA,NA,"Metabolites of zearalenone and phytohormones secreted by endophytic fungus strain TH15 regulating the root development in Tetrastigma hemsleyanum","PLANT CELL TISSUE AND ORGAN CULTURE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0167-6857","1573-5044",NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2022,150,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,"683","694",NA,"10.1007/s11240-022-02321-5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11240-022-02321-5",NA,"5/22/2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000800077300001","View Full Record in Web of Science",21,NA

"27","Presence","This study investigated the biodiversity, phylogeny, and antifungal activity of endophytic fungi isolated from Zanthoxylum bungeanum. A total of 940 isolates obtained were grouped into 93 morphotypes, 43 species, and 23 genera, which were authenticated by molecular identification based on rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analysis. A high diversity of endophytic fungi from Z. bungeanum are observed with high species richness S (43), Margalef index D (6.1351), Shannon-Wiener index H (3.2743), Simpson diversity index D-s (0.9476), PIE index (0.9486), and evenness Pielou index J (0.8705) but a low dominant index (0.0524). Significant tissue specificity of the endophytic fungi was observed in Z. bungeanum, and the highest species richness and diversity indexes were obtained in the stem. Phylogenetic analyses of the 93 endophytic isolates were carried out by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method to demonstrate their evolutionary processes. Antifungal activities of endophytic fungi were assayed and eight endophytic isolates showed strong and long-lasting inhibition against host pathogenic fungi Fusarium sambucinum and Pseudocercospora zanthoxyli. Here, for the first time, we systematically demonstrate the biodiversity, phylogeny, and antifungal activity of endophytic fungi associated with Z. bungeanum and reveal the value of sampling different tissues of a given plant to obtain the greatest endophyte species diversity, which might offer a framework for further investigation and utilization of endophytic fungi as aunique source of interesting and useful bioactive compounds.","J","Li, PQ; Wu, Z; Liu, T; Wang, YN",NA,NA,NA,"Li, Peiqin; Wu, Zhou; Liu, Tao; Wang, Yanan",NA,NA,"Biodiversity, Phylogeny, and Antifungal Functions of Endophytic Fungi Associated with Zanthoxylum bungeanum","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Li, Peinqin/0000-0003-3517-8397",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1422-0067",NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2016,17,"9",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1541","10.3390/ijms17091541","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms17091541",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27649145,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000385525500163","View Full Record in Web of Science",31,NA
"28","Presence","Background: Symbiotic interactions with fungal endophytes are argued to be responsible for the tolerance of plants to some stresses and for their adaptation to natural conditions. Aims: In this study we aimed to examine the endophytic fungal diversity associated with roots of date palms growing in coastal dune systems, and to screen this collection of endophytes for potential use as biocontrol agents, for antagonistic activity and mycoparasitism, and as producers of antifungal compounds with potential efficacy against root diseases of date palm. Methods: Roots of nine individual date palms growing in three coastal locations in the South-East of Spain (Guardamar, El Carabassl, and San Juan) were selected to isolate endophytic fungi. Isolates were identified on the basis of morphological and/or molecular characters. Results: Five hundred and fifty two endophytic fungi were isolated and assigned to thirty morphological taxa or molecular operational taxonomic units. Most isolates belonged to Ascomycota, and the dominant order was Hypocreales. Fusarium and Clonostachys were the most frequently isolated genera and were present at all sampling sites. Comparisons of the endophytic diversity with previous studies, and their importance in the management of the date palm crops are discussed. Conclusions: This is the first study on the diversity of endophytic fungi-associated with roots of date palm. The isolates obtained might constitute a source of biological control agents and biofertilizers for use in crops of this plant. (C) 2016 Asociacion Espafiola de Micologia.

This fungus is controlled mainly by using synthetic fungicides, but many resistant isolates have been selected by the indiscriminate use of fungicides. Endophytic fungi or secondary metabolites obtained from them become an alternative method of control for this fungus. The aim of this work was to identify endophytic fungi with antifungal activity against the plant pathogenic fungusB. cinereaisolated from plants from Central Andean Precordillera of Chile. Three endophytic fungi (Ac1, Lc1 and Ec1) with antifungal activity againstB. cinereawere isolated from native and endemic plants growing in Central Andean Precordillera of Chile.

"30","Review","Endophytic fungi infect plant tissues by evading the immune response, potentially stimulating stress-tolerant plant growth. The plant selectively allows microbial colonization to carve endophyte structures through phenotypic genes and metabolic signals. Correspondingly, fungi develop various adaptations through symbiotic signal transduction to thrive in mycorrhiza. Over the past decade, the regulatory mechanism of plant-endophyte interaction has been uncovered. Currently, great progress has been made on plant endosphere, especially in endophytic fungi. Here, we systematically summarize the current understanding of endophytic fungi colonization, molecular recognition signal pathways, and immune evasion mechanisms to clarify the transboundary communication that allows endophytic fungi colonization and homeostatic phytobiome. In this work, we focus on immune signaling and recognition mechanisms, summarizing current research progress in plant-endophyte communication that converge to improve our understanding of endophytic fungi.","J","Lu, HY; Wei, TY; Lou, HH; Shu, XL; Chen, QH",NA,NA,NA,"Lu, Hongyun; Wei, Tianyu; Lou, Hanghang; Shu, Xiaoli; Chen, Qihe",NA,NA,"A Critical Review on Communication Mechanism within Plant-Endophytic Fungi Interactions to Cope with Biotic and Abiotic Stresses","JOURNAL OF FUNGI",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"chen, qian/HKE-2403-2023; Chen, QH/GXH-3158-2022; lu, hongyun/GXG-8911-2022; Chen, Qihe/G-4425-2012","Chen, Qihe/0000-0003-3862-4356; , Xiaoli/0000-0002-8173-7703",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2309-608X",NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2021,7,"9",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"719","10.3390/jof7090719","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof7090719",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34575757,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000699655300001","View Full Record in Web of Science",34,NA

"32","Presence","The potential of endophytes to initiate changes in host secondary metabolism is expected to be applied to improve the biochemical qualities of the crop. Our previous study revealed the significant impacts of fungal endophytes on the biochemical properties and the anthocyanin profiles in grape berries of the local cultivar 'Rose Honey' (RH). To validate the effects, our present work further assessed the impacts of the same fungal endophytes on grape berries of the worldwide planted grapevine cultivar 'Cabernet Sauvignon' (CS). Consistent with the results of RH, exposure to most of the used endophytic fungi shaped the biochemical traits and anthocyanidin profile of the CS grape berries. Among the detected biochemical traits, the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity in berries had the strongest response to endophytic fungal exposure, and the fungal strains RH32, RH36, and MDR1 had the greatest biochemical impacts on the grape berries. Interestingly, the most anthocyanidin species were detected in the two grape berry varieties when exposed to fungal strains MDR36 and RH34. In both varieties, the total anthocyanin concentrations were quantitatively promoted by strains RH36, RH44, MDR1, and MDR36, but suppressed by strain RH7. Malvidin derivatives and delphinidin derivatives accounted for the majority of the relative abundance of the total detected anthocyanins in CS berries. The acylation degree of anthocyanins in grape berries was also significantly promoted by exposure to fungal endophytes. In CS grape berries, a seldom-distributed anthocyanidin, pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside, as well as the diglucoside anthocyanidin were detected when exposed to fungal strains as RH32, RH34, RH36, MDR1, MDR4, and MDR36. Overall, the endophytic fungal strains MDR36, RH36, and RH34 have the ability to promote metabolite profiles in both grape varieties. This work confirms the possibility of using certain endophytic fungal strains as a strategy for shaping grape pigmentation in vinification at the post-veraison or post-harvest stages.","J","Pan, XX; Chen, CX; Wang, YT; Zhu, YY; Yang, MZ",NA,NA,NA,"Pan, Xiao-Xia; Chen, Chun-Xiao; Wang, Yu-Tao; Zhu, You-Yong; Yang, Ming-Zhi",NA,NA,"Exposure to the Endophytic Fungi Regulates the Anthocyanin Profiles in the Post-Veraison Grape Berries of 'Cabernet Sauvignon'","HORTICULTURAE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yang, Mingzhi/0000-0002-3134-7643",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2311-7524",NA,NA,NA,"FEB",2023,9,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"237","10.3390/horticulturae9020237","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/horticulturae9020237",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000939253200001","View Full Record in Web of Science",36,NA

Studies on endophytic fungi have been conducted in Korea for over 30 years. This paper summarizes the published results of those studies. The endophytic fungi of approximately 132 plant species in Korea have been studied since the 1990s, resulting in over 118 publications. The host plants featured in these studies comprised 3 species of mosses, 34 species of woody plants, and 95 species of herbaceous plants. At the family level, the most studied plants were members of the Poaceae family, covering 18 species. Regionally, these studies were conducted throughout Korea, but over half of the studies were conducted in Gyeongsangbuk-do, Gangwon-do, and Chungcheongnam-do. Relatively few studies have been conducted in a metropolis such as Seoul. We confirmed 5 phyla, 16 classes, 49 orders, 135 families, 305 genera, and 855 taxa of endophytic fungi, excluding Incertae sedis, whose relationship with others are unknown. Most of the endophytic fungi belonged to Ascomycota (93.2%), and a few belonged to Basidiomycota (3.6%). Since the diversity of endophytic fungi differs depending on the host plant, plant tissue, and distribution region, future studies should be conducted on multiple host plants and in various regions.

"35","Presence","Ethylene, the first known gaseous phytohormone, is involved in plant growth, development as well as responses to environmental signals. However, limited information is available on the role of ethylene in endophytic fungi induced secondary metabolites biosynthesis. Atractylodes lancea is a traditional Chinese herb, and its quality depends on the main active compounds sesquiterpenoids. This work showed that the endophytic fungus Gilmaniella sp. AL12 induced ethylene production in Atractylodes lancea. Pre-treatment of plantlets with ethylene inhibiter aminooxyacetic acid (AOA) suppressed endophytic fungi induced accumulation of ethylene and sesquiterpenoids. Plantlets were further treated with AOA, salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol (PAC), jasmonic acid inhibitor ibuprofen (IBU), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenger catalase (CAT), nitric oxide (NO) -specific scavenger 2-(4-Carboxypheny1)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxy1-3-oxide potassium salt (cPTIO). With endophytic fungi inoculation, IBU or PAC did not inhibit ethylene production, and JA and SA generation were suppressed by AOA, showing that ethylene may act as an upstream signal of JA and SA pathway. With endophytic fungi inoculation, CAT or cPTIO suppressed ethylene production, and H2O2 or NO generation was not affected by 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), showing that ethylene may act as a downstream signal of H2O2 and NO pathway. Then, plantlets were treated with ethylene donor ACC, JA, SA, H2O2, NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Exogenous ACC could trigger JA and SA generation, whereas exogenous JA or SA did not affect ethylene production, and the induced sesquiterpenoids accumulation triggered by ACC was partly suppressed by IBU and PAC, showing that ethylene acted as an upstream signal of JA and SA pathway. Exogenous ACC did not affect H2O2 or NO generation, whereas exogenous H2O2 and SNP induced ethylene production, and the induced sesquiterpenoids accumulation triggered by SNP or H2O2 was partly suppressed by ACC, showing that ethylene acted as a downstream signal of NO and H2O2 pathway. Taken together, this study demonstrated that ethylene is an upstream signal of JA and SA, and a downstream signal of NO and H2O2 signaling pathways, and acts as an important signal mediating sesquiterpenoids biosynthesis of Atractylodes lancea induced by the endophytic fungus.","J","Yuan, J; Sun, K; Deng-Wang, MY; Dai, CC",NA,NA,NA,"Yuan, Jie; Sun, Kai; Deng-Wang, Meng-Yao; Dai, Chuan-Chao",NA,NA,"The Mechanism of Ethylene Signaling Induced by Endophytic Fungus Gilmaniella sp AL12 Mediating Sesquiterpenoids Biosynthesis in Atractylodes lancea","FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-462X",NA,NA,NA,NA,"45374",2016,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"361","10.3389/fpls.2016.00361","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2016.00361",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27047528,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000372566200001","View Full Record in Web of Science",39,NA

Many of these fungi are primarily biotrophic, but the trophic range of endophytic fungi as a group may not be fully appreciated. In this study, our goals were (1) for the Class 3 foliar endophytic fungi isolated from Quercus gambelii, determine their potential saprotrophic ca-pacity, which we define as the difference in growth rate in culture on Quercus gambelii leaf litter medium and control medium lacking leaf litter and (2) quantify sources of variation among isolates of these endophytic fungi in potential saprotrophic capacity, including variation due to microsite within host trees (leaves receiving full sun vs. shade) and variation within and among fungal genera. We found that 48 of the 49 tested endophytic fungal isolates have significant potential saprotrophic capacity. Contrary to expectation, the amount of solar radiation available to the leaf from which the fungi were isolated had no significant impact on potential sap-rotrophic capacity and there was more variability in potential saprotrophic capacity among isolates within a genus than among genera. Our results suggest that some Class 3 endophytic fungi may have the potential to function as saprotrophic fungi within plant litter, but this remains to be seen for these Quercus gambelii isolates under more natural circumstances.","J","Davis, EL; Weatherhead, E; Koide, RT",NA,NA,NA,"Davis, Emily Lorine; Weatherhead, Emily; Koide, Roger T.",NA,NA,"The potential saprotrophic capacity of foliar endophytic fungi from Quercus gambelii","FUNGAL ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Koide, Roger/AAE-7763-2020","Koide, Roger/0000-0002-5209-5422",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1754-5048","1878-0083",NA,NA,NA,"APR",2023,62,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"101221","10.1016/j.funeco.2022.101221","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funeco.2022.101221",NA,"12/22/2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000910702000001","View Full Record in Web of Science",41,NA
"38","Presence","Endophytic fungi are a group of fungi that reside in the living plant without causing any disease symptoms. It shows symbiotic/mutualistic characteristics with host plants. Endophytic fungi may increase the host defense system against various pathogenic microorganisms and may encompass secondary metabolites of respective host plants. Isolation of endophytic fungi and its metabolites from Justicia gendarussa plant grown in Bangladesh is a recent and new approach. A total of seven endophytic fungi were isolated and purified from the leaf and bark part of the plant. All of the isolated endophytic fungi were identified up to genus level on the basis of macroscopic and microscopic characteristics and up to species level on the basis of molecular characteristics as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Diaporthe pseudomangiferae, Pseudopestalotiopsis camelliae-sinensis, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Fusarium solani, Colletotrichum tropicale and Colletotrichum siamense. Preliminary chemical screening of the fungal extracts by thin-layer chromatographic technique revealed the presence of various compounds such as flavonoids, anthraquinones, couramins, isocoumarins etc. Fungal strain Pseudopestalotiopsis camelliae-sinensis exhibited significant antiradical activity through DPPH scavenging method and moderate antimicrobial activity against a wide range of human pathogenic microbes. Using brine shrimp lethality bioassay, all the isolates showed strong cytotoxic activity, therefore suggested that all the extracts may have bioactive metabolites. Overall, these findings indicate that Justicia gendarussa and its associated endophytic fungi could be an important source for exploring potentially bioactive compounds or leads for the new drug candidates.

They are potential agents for the production of new and bioactive compounds, as well as for the use in agriculture, medicine and industry. Endophytic fungi produce Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), which are low molecular weight compounds that readily evaporate at normal temperatures and pressures. Fungi are not only capable of producing a wide variety of volatile compounds, they are also able to metabolize them and they have a great importance in chemical ecology. Mixtures of VOCs produced by endophytic fungi are mainly composed by alcohols, aldehydes, esters, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, terpenoids, nitrogen and sulfur compounds. They can be used in biotechnological applications such as biofuels, mycofumigation, alellochemicals, flavor in food and in the chemotaxonomic identification of fungi.

"41","Review","Endophytic fungi as well as plant-parasitic nematodes probably coevolved with all plant life on earth including cultivated crop plants. While endophytic fungi often form mutualisitc associations to the benefit of the plant, plant-parasitic nematodes can cause detrimental yield losses. Although both groups of organisms interact very closely within the plant tissue, the potential role of endophytic fungi in nematode control was long overseen. Only recently has research on the interrelationships between endophytic fungi and plant-parasitic nematodes gained the interest of science working in plant protection. Numerous non-pathogenic endophytic fungi have been iisolated from agronomic crops such as tomato and banana and have shown antagonistic potential towards a diverse spectrum of plant-parasitic nematodes. This chapter reviews the research that has been conducted on the use of endophytic fungi to control plant-parasitic nematodes. The chapter concentrates on several important groups of mutualistic endophytic fungi, in particular the endomy-corrhizal fungi, Piriformospora indica, grass endophytes and Fusarium endophytes. Their biological control potential is presented and possible mode-of-actions are discussed. The review is meant to further stimulate research in this fascinating area and to provide a road map for practical application of endophytic fungi for the integrated management of plant-parasitic nematodes in the near future.","S","Hallmann, J; Sikora, RA",NA,"Davies, K; Spiegel, Y",NA,"Hallmann, Johannes; Sikora, Richard A.",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungi","BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF PLANT-PARASITIC NEMATODES: BUILDING COHERENCE BETWEEN MICROBIAL ECOLOGY AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS","Progress in Biological Control",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1573-5915",NA,"978-1-4020-9647-1",NA,NA,NA,2011,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"227","258",NA,"10.1007/978-1-4020-9648-8_10","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-9648-8_10","10.1007/978-1-4020-9648-8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000293759700010","View Full Record in Web of Science",45,NA

This tool has been used for rapid identification of the endophytic fungi of sugarcane belonging to different genera for their further potential utilization. Methodology : Eight isolates belonging to three endophytic fungi viz. Coiletotrichum faicatum, Fusarium moniliforme and Trichoderma viride isolated from sugarcane plant were used for differentiation using PCR-RFLP pattern of rDNA. For this, the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of rDNA was amplified with the help of universal primers and the PCR products were digested with various restriction enzymes. Results : The size variation of amplified products ranged from 637 bp (C. falcaturn isolates), 592-614 bp (F. moniliforme isolates) to 631-698 bp (T.viride isolates). Five restriction enzymes viz. Alu I, EcoR I, Barn H I, MSe land Smal used for PCR-RFLP of ITS fragments yielded a total of 54 bands that were arranged in three RFLP patterns. Interpretation : Banding pattern obtained with the combination of Alu I and Mse I enzymes presented the best profile to identify the endophytic fungi and allowed distinction at molecular level.

"43","Presence","Plants exhibit beneficial associations between fungal endophytes and roots for better growth, disease suppression, and stress tolerance. Considerable information is now available about the beneficial role of fungal endophytes. In this study, endophytic fungi Chaetomium sp., Curvularia chonburiensis, C. specifera, C. hawaiiensis, Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium solani, Talaromyces assiutensis and T. trachyspermus isolated and evaluated for nematocidal activity against a root-knot nematode Meloidogyne javanica. The culture filtrates of endophytic fungi were prepared and used to check their efficacy against root knot nematodes. The culture filtrates of endophytic fungi were applied to pot and field experiments using soybean as host plants. In vitro study of these endophytic fungal culture filtrates showed strong nematocidal activity by killing juveniles of M. javanica to a certain degree, while Chaetomium sp., and Talaromyces assiutensis showed 100% mortality rate after 48 h. The application of Cephalosporium sp., Chaetomium sp., Talaromyces trachyspermus and T. assiutensis suppressed root rotting fungi of soybean in both screen house and field plots experiments. Significance of fungal isolates was further confirmed by repeated experiments. Endophytic fungi also showed positive impacts on the host plants by increasing the rate of their growth and improving their tolerance level to biotic stress which was evident by the production of increased amounts of resistance markers like salicylic acid and polyphenol contents with subsequent improvement of the antioxidant status. The n-hexane fraction of the culture filtrate of Chaetomium sp., were subjected to GC-MS analysis for the identification of compounds and some new compounds have been reported for the first time from this fungus.

"44","Review","Background Scientific approaches into modern agricultural systems, as opposed to the use of synthetic pesticides in food production, became important by exploring endophytic fungi capable of protecting plants against pathogens for maximum crop productivity. Main body Diverse endophytic microbes colonizing the internal tissue of plants exhibit beneficial and pathological effects on plants. The beneficial endophytic fungi assisted plants in the control of pathogenic endophytic fungi in plants due to their ability to directly or indirectly promote plant health. Inefficient agricultural practices and environmental factors contribute to the disease emergence in plants. Endophytic fungi employed diverse mechanisms in phytopathogen control by activating and inducing plant resistance through gene expression, synthesis of fungi-derived metabolite compounds, and hormonal signaling molecules. The mutual coexistence between endophytic fungi and host plants remains an important mechanism in disease suppression. An in-depth understanding and selection of beneficial endophytic fungi and interaction between pathogens and host plants are important in managing challenges associated with the endophyte biocontrol mechanisms. Conclusion Research findings on the use of endophytic fungi as bioinoculants are advancing, and understanding endophytic fungi antibiosis action through the synthesis of biocontrol agents (BCAs) can, however, be explored in integrated plant disease management. Therefore, in this review, the biocontrol mechanism of endophytic fungi against plant pathogens was highlighted.","J","Adeleke, BS; Ayilara, MS; Akinola, SA; Babalola, OO",NA,NA,NA,"Adeleke, Bartholomew Saanu; Ayilara, Modupe Stella; Akinola, Saheed Adekunle; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti",NA,NA,"Biocontrol mechanisms of endophytic fungi","EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ayilara, Modupe Stella/GVR-8764-2022; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti/Y-7564-2019; Adeleke, Bartholomew/ACQ-1241-2022; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti/HJI-7611-2023","Ayilara, Modupe Stella/0000-0002-8298-1935; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti/0000-0003-4344-1909; Adeleke, Bartholomew/0000-0001-7707-8816; Akinola, Saheed/0000-0002-6520-8609",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1110-1768","2536-9342",NA,NA,NA,"45406",2022,32,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"46","10.1186/s41938-022-00547-1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41938-022-00547-1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000786450100002","View Full Record in Web of Science",49,NA
"45","Review","Endophytic fungi are capable of producing plant associated metabolites and their analogs with therapeutic value. In order to identify the potential endophytic isolates producing bioactive compounds, one need to screen all isolated endophytes, which may run into hundreds. Isolation of endophytic fungi is relatively a simple process; but screening of the isolated fungi for required metabolite production is a cumbersome process. Endophytic fungi producing plant associated metabolites may contain genes involved in the entire biosynthetic pathway(s). Therefore, ascertaining the presence of key enzymes of a particular biosynthetic pathway could serve as a molecular marker for screening of these endophytes to produce that metabolite. In absence of entire biosynthetic pathways in endophytic fungi, plant genes associated with that metabolic pathway could serve as markers. This review focuses on the impact of molecular approaches to screen the endophytic fungi for the production of bioactive compounds. An attempt has been made on screening of anticancer compounds like taxol (paclitaxel), podophyllotoxin, and camptothecin using molecular markers. The advantages of molecular approaches over conventional methods to screen endophytic fungi and also identification of endophytic fungi are discussed.","J","Vasundhara, M; Kumar, A; Reddy, MS",NA,NA,NA,"Vasundhara, M.; Kumar, Anil; Reddy, M.

"46","Review","Increased understanding of the interactions between endophytic fungi and plants has led to the discovery of a new generation of chemical compounds and processes between endophytic fungi and plants. Due to the long-term co-evolution between fungal endophytes and host plants, endophytes have evolved special biotransformation abilities, which can have critical consequences on plant metabolic processes and their composition. Biotransformation or bioconversion can impact the synthesis and decomposition of hormones, sugars, amino acids, vitamins, lipids, proteins, and various secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, polysaccharides, and terpenes. Endophytic fungi produce enzymes and various bioactive secondary metabolites with industrial value and can degrade or sequester inorganic and organic small molecules and macromolecules (e.g., toxins, pollutants, heavy metals). These fungi also have the ability to cause highly selective catalytic conversion of high-value compounds in an environmentally friendly manner, which can be important for the production/innovation of bioactive molecules, food and nutrition, agriculture, and environment.

Seventy species of 29 genera of endophytic fungi in D. bicornis and 71 species of 30 genera in P. flavidum were documented. Endophytic fungal communities were grouped into 40 and 43 anamorphic ascomycetes (21 and 23 genera) and 20 teleomorphic ascomycetes (6 and 7 genera) in D. bicornis and P. flavidum, respectively. PDA supported the expression of larger number of fungal communities than MEA and MB; and P. flavidum hosted more number of endophytic fungi than D. bicornis. Seasons played an important role in supporting the assemblage of fungal endophytes. Endophytic fungal species richness and assemblages in plant regions were determined for alpha, beta, and gamma diversities. The ethyl acetate followed by methanolic extracts of certain fungal species showed good antagonistic and antibacterial activities. Among fungal endophytes, Curvularia protuberata and Penicillium citrinum exhibited high antagonistic and antibacterial activities. The high-resolution orbitrap liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry of ethyl acetate crude extracts of C. protuberata and P. citrinum revealed the presence of antifungal and antimicrobial, besides a host of compounds in the extracts.

In particular, endophytic fungi is one of the important kinds of microorganisms and has a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship with host plants. Endophytic fungi have many substantial benefits to host plants, especially for woody plants, such as accelerating plant growth, enhancing stress resistance, promoting nutrient absorption, resisting pathogens and etc. However, the effects of endophytic fungi on the growth and development of woody plants have not been systematically summarized. In this review, the functions of endophytic fungi for the growth and development of woody plants have been mainly reviewed, including regulating plant growth (e.g., flowering, root elongation, etc.) by producing nutrients and plant hormones, and improving plant disease, insect resistance and heavy metal resistance by producing secondary metabolites. In addition, the diversity of endophytic fungi could improve the ability of woody plants to adapt to adverse environment. The components produced by endophytic fungi have excellent potential for the growth and development of woody plants. This review has systematically discussed the potential regulation mechanism of endophytic fungi regulating the growth and development of woody plants, it would be of great significance for the development and utilization of endophytic fungi resource from woody plants for the protection of forest resources.","J","Qin, XY; Xu, J; An, XL; Yang, J; Wang, Y; Dou, MJ; Wang, MG; Huang, J; Fu, YJ",NA,NA,NA,"Qin, Xiangyu; Xu, Jian; An, Xiaoli; Yang, Jie; Wang, Yao; Dou, Meijia; Wang, Minggang; Huang, Jin; Fu, Yujie",NA,NA,"Insight of endophytic fungi promoting the growth and development of woody plants","CRITICAL REVIEWS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Fu, Yu/IQU-3004-2023; LI, Xiang/JBJ-8387-2023; Jiang, Cheng/JHU-0179-2023","JIN, HUANG/0000-0002-2569-9159",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0738-8551","1549-7801",NA,NA,NA,"2023 JAN 2",2023,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1080/07388551.2022.2129579","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07388551.2022.2129579",NA,"1/23/2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36592988,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000905928200001","View Full Record in Web of Science",56,NA

"52","Review","The beneficial effects of endophytes on plant growth are important for agricultural ecosystems because they reduce the need for fertilizers and decrease soil and water pollution while compensating for environmental perturbations. Endophytic fungi are a novel source of bioactive secondary metabolites; moreover, recently they have been found to produce physiologically active gibberellins as well. The symbiosis of gibberellins producing endophytic fungi with crops can be a promising strategy to overcome the adverse effects of abiotic stresses. The association of such endophytes has not only increased plant biomass but also ameliorated plant-growth during extreme environmental conditions. Endophytic fungi represent a trove of unexplored biodiversity and a frequently overlooked component of crop ecology. The present review describes the role of gibberellins producing endophytic fungi, suggests putative mechanisms involved in plant endophyte stress interactions and discusses future prospects in this field.","J","Khan, AL; Hussain, J; Al-Harrasi, A; Al-Rawahi, A; Lee, IJ",NA,NA,NA,"Khan, Abdul Latif; Hussain, Javid; Al-Harrasi, Ahmed; Al-Rawahi, Ahmed; Lee, In-Jung",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi: resource for gibberellins and crop abiotic stress resistance","CRITICAL REVIEWS IN BIOTECHNOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Lee, In-Jung/GLS-0432-2022; Khan, Abdul Latif/B-1005-2010; Hussain, Javid/AAC-5053-2020","Lee, In-Jung/0000-0001-7154-4820; Khan, Abdul Latif/0000-0001-9700-8903",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0738-8551","1549-7801",NA,NA,NA,"MAR",2015,35,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,"62","74",NA,"10.3109/07388551.2013.800018","http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/07388551.2013.800018",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,23984800,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000350017200005","View Full Record in Web of Science",58,NA

This study reports the occurrence, diversity, and secondary metabolite profiles of endophytic fungi isolated from Salvia abrotanoides plants obtained from three geographically distinct sites in Iran. A total of 56 endophytic fungi were isolated from roots and leaves of S. abrotanoides; site-specificity and root-dominated colonization was found to be a general characteristic of the endophytes. Based on molecular identification, the endophytic fungi were classified into 15 genera. Mycelial extracts of these isolates were subjected to high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses and revealed a broad spectrum of secondary metabolites. Our results demonstrated that Penicillium canescens, P. murcianum, Paraphoma radicina, and Coniolariella hispanica are producers of cryptotanshinone, which is a main bioactive compound of S. abrotanoides. Moreover, it was shown that it can be produced independent of the host plant. The effect of exogenous gibberellin on S. abrotanoides and endophytic fungi was shown to have a positive effect on increasing the cryptotanshinone production in the plant as well as in endophytic fungi cultivated under axenic conditions. Our findings provide further evidence that endophytic fungi play an important role in the production plant bioactive metabolites.

"59","Presence","Aims: Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that live asymptomatically within plant tissues, producing a wide range of metabolites, including compounds potentially useful for drug development. We investigated endophytic fungi from Maliau Basin, Sabah to identify strains producing bioactive compounds, notably with antimicrobial activity. Methodology and results: A total of 23 plants were sampled yielding 345 endophytic fungal isolates. Of these, 44 isolates were screened for antimicrobial activity against nine species of bacteria and fungi, revealing 14 endophytes producing bioactive metabolites. Crude fungal extracts were obtained from broth cultures of endophytic isolates with promising activity while the fungal strains were identified using molecular methods. The crude extract of endophyte MB4 WA10, isolated from Callophyllum sp. (bintangor) showed IC50 of 2.6 mg/mL against S. aureus and 0.6 mg/mL against B. subtilis while the extract of MB22 WA16, an isolate identified as Valsaceae sp., was also active against S. aureus with an IC50 of 1.37 mg/mL. Another isolate, namely MB5 L4 (WA), was identified as a Phomopsis sp. and its extract was the most active against S. aureus with an IC50 of 1 mg/mL. The HPLC fraction of this fungal extract with the highest inhibition (92.37%) of S. aureus was purified for compound isolation and identification. A polyketide compound, 2,3-dihydro-2-hydroxy-2,4-dimethyl-5-trans-propenylfuran-3-one (C9H12O3), with molecular weight of 168.192 was identified based on mass spectral and NMR data analysis.

"60","Presence","Huperzia serrata is a Huperzine A (HupA)-producing herb. HupA is a potent, reversible, highly specific, centrally active and selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and is commonly used to improve Alzheimer's disease.At present, H. serrata resources have been overexploited and their artificial cultivation has lagged behind the need, so the market demand cannot be met. In this study, the diversity of the endophytic fungi in H. serrata was studied by high-throughput sequencing and traditional culture methods. Furthermore, the ability of the isolated endophytic fungi to produce acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting activity was evaluated. The results related to the diversity of fungi between high-throughput sequencing and traditional culture methods were compared. With high-throughput sequencing, five phyla, 22 classes, 55 orders, 120 families, and 178 genera of fungi were detected in Hubei Province, and five phyla, 22 classes, 54 orders, 124 families, and 196 genera were detected in Fujian Province. After cultivation with traditional culture methods, two phyla, three classes, five orders, six families, and six genera were detected in Hubei, and one phylum, three classes, five orders, five families, and six genera in Fujian. The endophytic fungi of H. serrata are highly diverse, and the results of high-throughput sequencing comprehensively reflect their community compositions. When the acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting activity of the isolated and cultured endophytic fungi was determined, five and three endophytic fungi from Hubei and Fujian Provinces, respectively, had good inhibitory activity (inhibition rate > 50%). Most of them were separated from leaf tissue. The strain HBR-1 and strain FJL-5 had the strongest inhibitory effects on AChE, with inhibition rates of 72.34% and 60.54%, respectively. Although only a proportion of the endophytic fungi was isolated with traditional culture methods, metabolites with broad potential applications can be isolated from these fungal cultures. The combination of high-throughput sequencing and traditional culture methods can be used to isolate and purify endophytic fungi in a targeted manner, gain many endophytic fungi, and enrich the endophytic fungi resource library.","J","Lu, ZY; Ma, YS; Xiao, LT; Yang, HL; Zhu, D",NA,NA,NA,"Lu, Ziyun; Ma, Yangshuai; Xiao, Liting; Yang, Huilin; Zhu, Du",NA,NA,"Diversity of Endophytic Fungi in Huperzia serrata and Their Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitory Activity","SUSTAINABILITY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2071-1050",NA,NA,NA,"NOV",2021,13,"21",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"12073","10.3390/su132112073","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132112073",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000718619800001","View Full Record in Web of Science",67,NA
"61","Presence","Biotransformation has been successfully employed to conduct uncommon reactions, which would hardly be carried out by chemical synthesis. A wide diversity of compounds may be metabolized by fungi, leading to chemical derivatives through selective reactions that work under ecofriendly conditions. Endophytic fungi live inside vegetal tissues without causing damage to the host plant, making available unique enzymes for interesting chemical derivatization. Biotransformation of steroids by endophytic fungi may provide new derivatives as these microorganisms came from uncommon and underexplored habitats. In this study, endophytic strains isolated from Handroanthus impetiginosus leaves were assayed for biotransformation of progesterone, and its derivatives were identified through GC-EI-MS analysis. The endophyte Talaromyces sp. H4 was capable of transforming the steroidal nucleus selectively into four products through selective ene-reduction of the C4-C5 double bond and C-17 oxidation. The best conversion rate of progesterone (> 90 %) was reached with Penicillium citrinum H7 endophytic strain that transformed the substrate into one derivative. The results highlight endophytic fungi's potential to obtain new and interesting steroidal derivatizations.","J","dos Santos, VHP; Luiz, JHH; dos Anjos, JP; Silva, ED",NA,NA,NA,"dos Santos, Valmore Henrique Pereira; Luiz, Jaine Honorata Hortolan; dos Anjos, Jeancarlo Pereira; Silva, Eliane de Oliveira",NA,NA,"Oxidative potential of two Brazilian endophytic fungi from Handroanthus impetiginosus towards progesterone","STEROIDS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"dos Anjos, Jeancarlo Pereira/L-7499-2016; Luiz, Jaine/E-5599-2013","dos Anjos, Jeancarlo Pereira/0000-0001-8353-1066; Luiz, Jaine/0000-0002-0448-5004",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0039-128X","1878-5867",NA,NA,NA,"NOV",2022,187,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"109101","10.1016/j.steroids.2022.109101","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.steroids.2022.109101",NA,"8/22/2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35970224,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000848617200002","View Full Record in Web of Science",68,NA

Seventy-nine fungal isolates obtained from C. chinensis were identified to belong to 27 species based on morphological features and internal transcript spacer (ITS) gene sequencing analysis. Comparing relative frequency values, the most frequent genera were Colletotrichum and Fusarium, while most frequent species were C. gloeosporioides and F. avenaceum. Analysis of diversity indices indicated that C. chinensis harbored abundant fungal resources. Methanol extracts of fungal endophyte cultures were evaluated for antibacterial activity against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and two other MRSA clinical strains. Nine of 27 endophytic fungi exhibited inhibitory activities against S. aureus ATCC 25923. Among them, Paraboeremia litseae HL-17, Fusarium sp. HL-23, and Fusarium sp.

According to chemical structures and biosynthetic pathways, secondary metabolites are mainly divided into four groups, including polyketide, nonribosomal peptides, alkaloids, and terpenes. Owing to their special living environment, plant endophytic fungi potentially produce many bioactive metabolites with diverse structural features. Some of these metabolites have been demonstrated to hold pharmaceutical and ecological significance. In order to identify bioactive compounds, different methods have been developed to isolate secondary metabolites from plant endophytic fungi. In this chapter, we describe the procedures for fungal fermentation, metabolite extraction, and analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis fici, which was isolated from the healthy branches of Camellia sinensis (Theaceae), produces 88 secondary metabolites including 70 new natural products. Combining 74 secondary metabolite clusters revealed by genome sequencing analysis, P. fici is used as an example for analysis of secondary metabolites.

In total 4345 fungal nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region sequences (rDNA ITS) obtained from all sugar beet grown in two locations (Shihezi and Changji) on the north slope of Tianshan Mountain, China. The most abundant fungal groups in all sugar beet were Basidiomycota (97.26%). The other dominant phyla were from Ascomycota (0.61%) and Glomeromycota (2.13%). There was a marked difference in diversity of endophytic fungi in sugar beet for different growth stages. The greatest number of Operational T-RFLP Units was detected during sucrose accumulation (84) and tuber growth (74). Endophytic fungal diversity was reduced during seedling growth (18 OTUs) and rosette formation (58 OTUs). One OTU was common to all four periods of growth. There were more OTUs in Shihezi than in Changji. The dynamics of endophytic fungal communities were influenced by plant genotype and plant growth stage. Results indicated that the three factors were significantly related (alpha = 0.05) to the distribution of endophytic fungi, with host species the most important, followed by sampling dates and sampling locations.

"72","Presence","Background Plants maintain the steady-state balance of the mutually beneficial symbiosis relationship with their endophytic fungi through secondary metabolites. Meanwhile endophytic fungi can serve as biological inducers to promote the biosynthesis and accumulation of valuable secondary metabolites in host plants through a variety of ways. The composition and structure of endophytic fungal community are affected by many factors, including tissues, seasons and so on. In this work, we studied the community diversity, temporal and spatial pattern of endophytic fungi detected from the roots, stems and leaves of Huperzia serrata in different seasons. The correlation between endophytic fungi and huperzine A (HupA) content in plants was analyzed. Results A total of 7005 operational taxonomic units were detected, and all strains were identified as 14 phyla, 54 classes, 140 orders, 351 families and 742 genera. Alpha diversity analysis showed that the diversity of endophytic fungi in stem and leaf was higher than that in root, and the diversity in summer (August) was lower than that in other months. NMDS analysis showed that the endophytic fungal communities of leaves, stems and roots were significantly different, and the root and leaf communities were also different between four seasons. Through correlation analysis, it was found that 33 genera of the endophytic fungi of H. serrata showed a significant positive correlation with the content of HupA (p < 0.05), of which 13 genera (Strelitziana, Devriesia, Articulospora, Derxomyces, Cyphellophora, Trechispora, Kurtzmanomyces, Capnobotryella, Erythrobasidium, Camptophora, Stagonospora, Lachnum, Golubevia) showed a highly significant positive correlation with the content of HupA (p < 0.01). These endophytic fungi may have the potential to promote the biosynthesis and accumulation of HupA in plant. Conclusions This report is the first time to analyze the diversity of endophytic fungi in tissues of H. serrata in different seasons, which proves that there is variability in different tissues and seasonal distribution patterns. These findings provide references to the study of endophytic fungi of H. serrata.","J","Shen, ZH; Liu, XB; Yang, J; Wang, YL; Yao, K; Huo, QM; Fu, YP; Wei, YH; Guo, B",NA,NA,NA,"Shen, Zhuhui; Liu, Xubing; Yang, Jia; Wang, Yanli; Yao, Kai; Huo, Qingmiao; Fu, Yanping; Wei, Yahui; Guo, Bin",NA,NA,"The temporal and spatial endophytic fungal community of Huperzia serrata: diversity and relevance to huperzine A production by the host","BMC MICROBIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1471-2180",NA,NA,NA,NA,"45620",2022,22,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"281","10.1186/s12866-022-02702-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12866-022-02702-y",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36424543,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000887908600001","View Full Record in Web of Science",82,NA
"73","Presence","Aims This study aimed to identify endophytic fungi from Anthemis altissima, Matricaria parthenium, Cichorium intybus, Achillea millefolium, and A. filipendulina with plant-promoting ability on the ZP684 maize hybrid-cultivar. Methods and results Plants were collected from northeast-Iran and endophytic fungi were isolated and identified using partial large subunit nrDNA, internal transcribed spacer, translation elongation factor, and beta-tubulin genetic markers. Endophytic fungi that improved seed germination were studied under greenhouse conditions. Ninety-seven endophytic fungi were identified. Preussia africana, Bjerkandera adusta, Schizophyllum commune, Alternaria embellisia, Trichaptum biforme, Septoria malagutii, A. consortiale, Verticillium dahliae, Fusarium avenacearum, and Trametes versicolor significantly improved seed-germination. Alternaria consortiale produced the highest level of indole-3-acetic acid-like compounds and maize growth-promoting. Conclusions Plant fungal colonization frequency increased with orthometric height. Sampling location Chahar Bagh at 2230 m contained the most endophytic fungi. Fusarium and Alternaria were the most frequently isolated endophytic genera. Therefore, medicinal plants are potential hosts for endophytic fungi that may be suitable biofertilizer agents in agriculture. Significance and impact of the study This study helps to better understand the ecosystem functions by investigating of endophytic fungi distribution under different ecological conditions.

In this study, we characterized the endophytic fungal communities associated with the roots and corresponding seeds of soybeans grown in the Huang-Huai region of China. For the roots, we identified 105 and 50 genera by culture-independent and culture-dependent (CD) methods, respectively, and isolated 136 fungal strains (20 genera) from the CD samples. Compared with the 52 soybean endophytic fungal genera reported in other countries, 28 of the genera we found were reported, and 90 were newly discovered. Even though Fusarium was the most abundant genus of fungal endophyte in every sample, soybean root samples from three cities exhibited diverse endophytic fungal communities, and the results between samples of roots and seeds were also significantly different. Together, we identified the major endophytic fungal genera in soybean roots and seeds, and revealed that the diversity of soybean endophytic fungal communities was influenced by geographical effects and tissues. The results will facilitate a better understanding of soybean-endophytic fungi interaction systems and will assist in the screening and utilization of beneficial microorganisms to promote healthy of plants such as soybean.","J","Yang, HJ; Ye, WW; Ma, JX; Zeng, DD; Rong, ZY; Xu, M; Wang, YC; Zheng, XB",NA,NA,NA,"Yang, Hongjun; Ye, Wenwu; Ma, Jiaxin; Zeng, Dandan; Rong, Zhenyang; Xu, Miao; Wang, Yuanchao; Zheng, Xiaobo",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungal communities associated with field-grown soybean roots and seeds in the Huang-Huai region of China","PEERJ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ye, Wenwu/J-5624-2014; wang, yuanchao/G-9667-2011; Ye, Wenwu/AAE-4961-2022; zeng, dan/HJJ-1301-2023","Ye, Wenwu/0000-0001-7347-8935; wang, yuanchao/0000-0001-5803-5343; Ye, Wenwu/0000-0001-7347-8935;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2167-8359",NA,NA,NA,NA,"45412",2018,6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"e4713","10.7717/peerj.4713","http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.4713",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29736345,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000431379100010","View Full Record in Web of Science",85,NA

"77","Review","NOVELTY STATEMENTPhytoremediation is an effective method for ecological remediation of heavy metal contaminated soil. Endophytic fungi such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, dark septate endophytic fungi, plant growth promoting endophytic fungi can synergistically improve the adaptability to heavy metal stress. This review comprehensively summarizes the regulation mechanism of plant response to heavy metal stress mediated by endophytic fungi for the first time, and provides new insights and proposals for exploring novel hyperaccumulator for phytoremediation more effectively. Endophytic fungi exist widely in plants and play an important role in the growth and adaptation of plants. They could be used in phytoremediation techniques against heavy metal contaminated soil since beneficial microbial symbionts can endow plants with resistance to external heavy metal stresses. This review summarized the regulation mechanism of plant response to heavy metal stress mediated by endophytic fungi. Potential endophytic fungi in enhancing plant's adaption to heavy metal stresses include arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, dark septate endophytic fungi, plant growth promoting endophytic fungi. The mechanisms involve coevolution strategy, immune regulation and detoxification transport to improve the ability of plants to adapt to heavy metal stress. They can increase the synthesis of host hormones and maintaining the balance of endogenous hormones, strengthen osmotic regulation, regulate carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and increase immune activity, antioxidant enzyme and glutathione activity. They also help to improve the detoxification transport and heavy metal emission capacity of the host by significantly producing iron carrier, metallothionein and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase. The combination of endophytic fungi and hyperaccumulation plants provides a promising technology for the ecological restoration of heavy metal contaminated soil. Endophytic fungi reserves further development on enhancing host plant's adaptability to heavy metal stresses.","J","Zheng, JD; Xie, XG; Li, CY; Wang, HX; Yu, YR; Huang, BK",NA,NA,NA,"Zheng, Jiadong; Xie, Xingguang; Li, Chunyan; Wang, Hongxia; Yu, Yaru; Huang, Baokang",NA,NA,"Regulation mechanism of plant response to heavy metal stress mediated by endophytic fungi","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYTOREMEDIATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yu, Yaru/AAU-3372-2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1522-6514","1549-7879",NA,NA,NA,"45580",2023,25,"12",NA,NA,NA,NA,"1596","1613",NA,"10.1080/15226514.2023.2176466","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2023.2176466",NA,"2/23/2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36786203,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000932241100001","View Full Record in Web of Science",87,NA

Total antioxidant capacity, xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity, antimicrobial activity, and total phenolic content (TPC) were evaluated for 16 representative fungal cultures grown in improved Czapek's broth and for the host plant. The total antioxidant capacities and phenolic contents of the fungal cultures ranged from 9.59 to 150.79 mu mol trolox/100 mL culture, and from 0.52 to 13.95 mg gallic acid/100 mL culture, respectively.

"81","Review","Endophytic fungi reside within the plant tissues and maintain a strong symbiotic relationship. They are of utmost importance as promising sources of chemically diverse bioactive natural products. These microbes alter gene expression levels, modulate biosynthetic pathways, mitigate stressful conditions in plants and thereby play an important role in establishing plant's defence system against potential pathogens. The quest for discovering new chemical entities of pharmaceutical importance has drawn attention towards the mangrove ecosystem, which offers unique biodiversity. Mangroove associated fungi live under stress conditions and are the potential source of chemically diverse metabolites. Some fungal metabolites served as lead molecules for the development of new anti-infective agents. These fungi were modified/tailored using epigenetic means or culture optimization methods to improve the yield of useful metabolites. The present review describes the compounds isolated from mangrove endophytic fungi during 2013-2019 (up to June 2019) with focus on their chemical structure and their anti-infective activity. The compounds identified from endophytic fungi are arranged based on their antibacterial, antimycobacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities. (c) 2020 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"82","Presence","Endophytic fungi are known to play an important role in driving the evolution of plants by conferring adaptational advantages to their host through the production of secondary metabolites and phytohormones. In this study, we evaluated the diversity and phylogenetic relationship of endophytic fungal communities from four Dendrobium species viz., Dendrobium chrysanthum, Dendrobium heterocarpum, Dendrobium hookerianum, and Dendrobium longicornu of Meghalaya, India. A total of 51 culturable endophytic fungi were isolated from the four selected orchid species. The isolates were identified based on nuclear large subunit sequences into 33 species. Approximately 91% of the isolates showed affinity to Ascomycetes, while 9% of the isolates showed BLAST search similarity to Basidiomycetes. The most common genera were Trichoderma and Xylaria. The most prevalent genera were Fusarium, which was detected in all the four Dendrobium species followed by Diaporthe, which was present in three Dendrobium species viz., D. chrysanthum, D. hookerianum, and D. heterocarpum.

"83","Presence","Background Huperzine A (Hup A) has attracted considerable attention as an effective therapeutic candidate drug used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Whereas, the production of Hup A from wild plants faced a major challenge, which is the wild Huperzia Serrata harbor a low Hup A content, has a long-life cycle, and has a small yield. At present, several reports showed that Hup A is produced by various endophytic fungal strains isolated from H. serrata, thereby providing an alternative method to produce the compound and reduce the consumption of this rare and endangered plant. However, till now, very few comprehensive studies are available on the biological diversity and structural composition of endophytic fungi and the effects of endophytic fungi on the Hup A accumulation in H. serrata. Results In this research, the composition and diversity of fungal communities in H. serrata were deciphered based on high-throughput sequencing technology of fungal internal transcribed spacer regions2 (ITS2). The correlation between endophytic fungal community and Hup A content was also investigated. Results revealed that the richness and the diversity of endophytic fungi in H. serrata was various according to different tissues and different ecological areas. The endophytic fungal communities of H. serrata exhibit species-specific, ecological-specific, and tissue-specific characteristics. There are 6 genera (Ascomycota_unclassified, Cyphellophora, Fungi_unclassified, Sporobolomyces, and Trichomeriaceae_unclassified) were significantly positively correlated with Hup A content in all two areas, whereas, there are 6 genera (Auricularia, Cladophialophora, Cryptococcus, Mortierella, and Mycena) were significantly negatively correlated with Hup A content of in all two areas. Conclusions This study indicated a different composition and diverse endophytic fungal communities in H. serrata from different organs and ecological areas. The current study will provide the realistic basis and theoretical significance for understanding the biological diversity and structural composition of endophytic fungal communities in H. serrata, as well as providing novel insights into the interaction between endophytic fungi and Hup A content.","J","Pang, B; Yin, DP; Zhai, YF; He, AG; Qiu, LL; Liu, Q; Ma, N; Shen, HJ; Jia, QJ; Liang, ZS; Wang, DK",NA,NA,NA,"Pang, Bo; Yin, Dengpan; Zhai, Yufeng; He, Anguo; Qiu, Linlin; Liu, Qiao; Ma, Nan; Shen, Hongjun; Jia, Qiaojun; Liang, Zongsuo; Wang, Dekai",NA,NA,"Diversity of endophytic fungal community in Huperzia serrata from different ecological areas and their correlation with Hup A content","BMC MICROBIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"liu, li/HGC-0900-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1471-2180",NA,NA,NA,NA,"45509",2022,22,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"191","10.1186/s12866-022-02605-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12866-022-02605-y",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35931950,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000836604000001","View Full Record in Web of Science",93,NA

A total of 59 endophytic fungal strains, isolated from roots in K.virginica of seedlings, were grouped into 12 genera including in Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Trichoderma, Rhizopycnis sp., Ceriporia Donk, Trametes sp., Schizophyllum commune sp., Alternaria, Cladosporium, Cylindrocarpon, and Scytalidium according to sequences of ITS. The ACD activity of 10 endophytic fungi isolated was detected. T.asperellum had the highest ACC deaminase activity among all 10 isolated genera of fungal strains, followed by T. viride. Dry weight and fresh weight of plant, plant height, root length, SOD activity, and chlorophyll content of wheat and soybean inoculated with T.asperellum or T. viride was increased compared with non-inoculated control plants under non salt or salt stress. Further analysis showed that T.asperellum or T.viride strains induced downregulation of the expression of ethylene synthesis-related genes such as ACC oxidase (ACO) and ACC synthase (ACS), thereby reducing ethylene synthesis and damage to plants under salt stress.

"85","Review","Endophytic fungi are various micro-organisms that inhabit intracellular or intercellular plant tissues in symbiotic association [at certain stages of their life cycles], without causing damage or morphological changes. The endophytes from medicinal plants are important resources for discovery of natural products and secondary bioactive metabolites having the potential biotechnological applications in agriculture, medicine, and allied sectors. The endophytic fungi such as Acremonium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Trichoderma, Penicillium, Phomopsis, Pestalotiopsis, Pseudomassari, Quercina, Trichoderma genera have been reported from different medicinal plants with potential therapeutic activity. On the other hand, the endophytic fungi can also confer profound impacts on their host plants like improvement in growth, activation of systemic tolerances towards abiotic/biotic stresses, enhancement of nutrient solublization, biosynthesis of phytohormones and stimulating accumulation of secondary metabolites. Endophytic fungi have attracted much research interest because they have provided not only novel sources of Cytotoxic compounds, Antimicrobial agents, Bio-stimulants for essential oil biosynthesis, Anticancer agents, antioxidant agents, anti-diabetic agents, immunosuppressant and insecticidal compounds.

In this study, 265 endophytic fungal isolates from C. hainanensis Li were screened for antimicrobial activities against tilapia, banana, rice, and rape and for antitumor activities against human leukemia cell lines (K562, NB4, and HL-60). Diversity was also analyzed. The results showed that 17.7% of the endophytic fungi had antimicrobial activities against at least three different test microbes, and activity against Fusarium oxysporum RKY102 was the highest at 15.8%. Cytotoxicity against at least one tumor cell line tested was observed in 18.5% of the endophytic fungi; with the highest value of 10.6% against K562. The endophytic fungal strains also showed relatively high activities against K562, NB4, and HL-60 while relatively fewer strains were cytotoxic against the human hepatic Hep-G2 and colon LoVo cancer cell lines.

"88","Presence","Background: An endophytic fungus lives within a healthy plant during certain stages of, or throughout, its life cycle. Endophytic fungi do not always cause plant disease, and they include fungi that yield different effects, including mutual benefit, and neutral and pathogenic effects. Endophytic fungi promote plant growth, improve the host plant's resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and can produce the same or similar biologically active substances as the host. Thus, endophytic fungal products have important implications in drug development. Result: Among the numerous endophytic fungi, we identified two strains, L10Q37 and LQ2F02, that have anti-acetylcholinesterase activity, but the active compound was not huperzine A. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-acetylcholinesterase activity of secondary metabolites isolated from the endophytic fungi of Huperzia serrata. Microbial cultivation and fermentation were used to obtain secondary metabolites. Active components were then extracted from the secondary metabolites, and their activities were tracked. Two compounds that were isolated from endophytic fungi of H. serrata were identified and had acetylcholine inhibitory activities. In conclusion, endophytic fungal strains were found in H. serrata that had the same anti-acetylcholinesterase activity. Conclusion: We isolated 4 compounds from the endophytic fungus L10Q37, among them S1 and S3 are new compounds. 6 compounds were isolated from LQ2F02, all 6 compounds are new compounds. After tested anti acetylcholinesterase activity, S5 has the best activity. Other compounds' anti acetylcholinesterase activity was not better compared with huperzine A.

"93","Presence","Despite the ubiquitous presence of fungal endophytes in woody plants, mechanisms underlying variation in foliar fungal endophyte communities are poorly understood. Given that endophytes in woody plants are predominantly horizontally transmitted, fungal endophyte colonization of foliar tissues is likely to be influenced by plant resistance traits. Here, we evaluated the association between leaf resistance traits and colonization and community composition of horizontally transmitted endophytes (HTE) in 10 dominant trees species in a temperate rainforest in Southern Chile. Because resistance traits might restrict colonization of HTE, it was hypothesized that host trees with similar leaf resistance traits would show similar HTE communities. We measured leaf traits with reported roles in plant resistance against pathogens and/or herbivores: cell wall polysaccharides, leaf toughness, flavonoids, anthocyanins, terpenoids and chitinases. We also determined variation in fungal read counts, number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), diversity and community structure across tree species. Foliar fungal endophyte communities were characterized using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of tagged amplicons of the ITS1 region. Fungal read counts were significantly different among host trees, while number of OTUs and diversity were similar among them. Multivariate analyses showed that community composition of endophytic fungi significantly differed among hosts, and that variation in cell wall, flavonoids, anthocyanins and terpenoids was associated with differences in HTE communities. We found that host trees sharing leaf resistance traits harbour similar HTE communities. Fungal read counts decreased with increasing content of cell wall polysaccharides, while endophyte diversity decreased with increasing anthocyanin levels. Fungal read counts, in contrast, were positively associated with terpenoids. Additionally, culture-based data indicated that some HTE strains inhibited the growth of the common fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea. Synthesis. Overall, we found that leaf resistance traits may influence fungal endophyte colonization and community composition in tree species, likely through deterrent effects of structural and chemical traits. We suggest that endophytic fungi that overcome resistance traits might play a role in plant protection.","J","González-Teuber, M; Vilo, C; Guevara-Araya, MJ; Salgado-Luarte, C; Gianoli, E",NA,"","","Gonzalez-Teuber, Marcia; Vilo, Claudia; Jose Guevara-Araya, Maria; Salgado-Luarte, Cristian; Gianoli, Ernesto",NA,NA,"Leaf resistance traits influence endophytic fungi colonization and community composition in a South American temperate rainforest","JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"González-Teuber, Marcia/ABH-2318-2021; Gianoli, Ernesto/A-7984-2015","González-Teuber, Marcia/0000-0003-0565-9333; Gianoli, Ernesto/0000-0003-4246-8640",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0022-0477","1365-2745","",NA,NA,"MAY",2020,108,"3",NA,"","",NA,"1019","1029","","10.1111/1365-2745.13314","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.13314","","19-Nov",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000498746300001","View Full Record in Web of Science",298,NA

It was used to transform ursolic acid (1), a pentacyclic triterpene. Incubation of ursolic acid with U. isabellina afforded three products, 3 beta-hydroxy-urs-11-en-28,13-lactone (2), 3/3,7 beta-dihydroxy-urs-11-en-28,13-lactone (3), 1 beta,3 beta-dihydroxy-urs-11-en-28,13-lactone (4). Although product 2 was a known compound, it was first obtained by microbial transformation. Products 3 and 4 were new compounds.

As the most important regulators of plant-soil feedback, root exudates can easily cause soil sickness in continuous monoculture systems by reducing certain microbes in the rhizosphere. In this study, exudates from roots colonized by the endophytic fungusPhomopsis liquidambarissignificantly increased rhizosphere bacterial abundance, soil respiration, microbial biomass and enzyme activities in a long-term continuously cropped peanut soil. Further analysis revealed thatP. liquidambaris-colonized root exudates clearly altered the carbon metabolism and rhizosphere bacterial diversity, which were closely correlated with changes in soil chemical properties caused by the exudates from the colonized roots. Finally, a synthetic root exudate experiment further confirmed that the root exudates derived fromP. liquidambariscolonization can indeed play an important role in promoting peanut growth. Therefore, these results show that this endophytic fungus could improve the carbon metabolism and rhizosphere bacterial community in long-term monoculture soils via exudates from colonized roots, which contribute to the alleviation of soil sickness.","J","Xie, XG; Zhao, YY; Yang, Y; Lu, F; Dai, CC",NA,"","","Xie, Xing-Guang; Zhao, Yuan-Yuan; Yang, Yang; Lu, Fan; Dai, Chuan-Chao",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungus Alleviates Soil Sickness in Peanut Crops by Improving the Carbon Metabolism and Rhizosphere Bacterial Diversity","MICROBIAL ECOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0095-3628","1432-184X","",NA,NA,"JUL",2021,82,"1",NA,"","SI",NA,"49","61","","10.1007/s00248-020-01555-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01555-0","","20-Jul",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32656607,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000547821800001","View Full Record in Web of Science",302,NA
"96","Presence","Recent studies have expanded research on biodiversity by investigating whether the effects of diversity on ecosystem functioning hinge on the presence of symbiotic microorganisms. Cool-season grasses commonly harbour endophytic fungi that can enhance plant resistance to herbivory, drought and competition. We address whether these endosymbionts modify relationships between diversity and two ecosystem properties: productivity and invasibility. We develop a graphical model that predicts endophyte infection of a grass host will weaken correlations between diversity and ecosystem properties. We then use a long-term field experiment to test this prediction by manipulating symbiosis in tall fescue grass (Festuca arundinacea), a common and invasive species in the US. As predicted, endophyte infection reduced the strength of correlations between diversity and both primary productivity and the invasiveness of tall fescue. By altering relationships between diversity and ecosystem functioning, endophytic fungi may contribute more to the dynamics of communities than previously supposed.","J","Rudgers, JA; Koslow, JM; Clay, K",NA,"","","Rudgers, JA; Koslow, JM; Clay, K",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi alter relationships between diversity and ecosystem properties","ECOLOGY LETTERS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Clay, Keith/C-8730-2012","Rudgers, Jennifer/0000-0001-7094-4857",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1461-023X","","",NA,NA,"JAN",2004,7,"1",NA,"","",NA,"42","51","","10.1046/j.1461-0248.2003.00543.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1461-0248.2003.00543.x","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000187274500006","View Full Record in Web of Science",304,NA

Here, we isolated 34 endophytes from the corms of Crocus sativus collected from Hecun Village, Zhejiang Province, China. Two strains, namely CS04 and CS29, symbiotically enhanced the biomass of C. sativus; induced biosynthesis and accumulation of its specialized metabolites, including crocin I and II, and antagonized the growth of pathogenic fungi for preventing rot disease. A multilocus phylogenetic analysis identified CS04 and CS29 as Talaromyces sp. and Penicillium sp., respectively. Treatment with CS04 and CS29 increased the activities of stress-related enzymes.

In addition, the endophytes investigated in the present study yielded various VOCs that were validated by chromatography for both standards and isolates. When the VOCs were subsequently analyzed for their prospective usage as myco-diesel, the presence of methane in the isolate SPSRJ28 was found to be highly significant.

"100","Presence","The availability of limiting nutrients plays a crucial role in shaping communities of endophytes. Moreover, whether fungal endophytes are host-specific remains controversial. We hypothesized that in a harsh and nitrogen (N)-deficient area, diversity and community composition of foliar endophytic fungi (FEFs) varied substantially among plots with experimentally elevated levels of macronutrients, and thus, N availability, instead of host species identity, would have a greater influence in structuring fungal communities at different scales. We also expected an important subset of taxa shared among numerous host species and N gradients to form a community-wide core microbiome. We measured the leaf functional traits and community structures of FEFs of three commonly seen species in an alpine meadow nested with a long-term N fertilization experiment. We found that host plant identity was a powerful factor driving the endophytic fungal community in leaves, even in habitats where productivity was strongly limited by nitrogen (p < 0.001). We also found that within the same host, nitrogen was an important driving force for the composition of the endophytic fungi community (p < 0.05). In addition, the leaf carbon content was the most important functional trait that limited the diversity of endophytic fungi (p < 0.001).

"102","Review","The natural product Huperzine A isolated from Huperzia serrata is a targeted inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase that has been approved for clinical use in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Given the large demand for natural sources of Huperzine A (Hup. A), efforts have been made to explore whether it is also produced by endophytic fungi from H. serrata and, if so, identify its biosynthetic pathway. These studies have indicated that endophytic fungi from H. serrata represent a huge and largely untapped resource for natural products (including Hup. A) with chemical structures that have been optimized by evolution for biological and ecological relevance. To date, more than three hundred endophytic fungi have been isolated from H. serrata, of which 9 strains can produce Hup. A, whilst more than 20 strains produce other important metabolites, such as polyketones, xanthones, alkaloids, steroids, triterpenoids, furanone derivatives, tremulane sesquitepenes and diterpenoids. In total, 200 secondary metabolites have been characterized in endophytic fungi from H. serrata to date. Functionally, some have cholinesterase-inhibitory or antibacterial activity. This review also considers the different classes of secondary metabolites produced by endophytic fungi, along with their possible applications. We systematically describe the taxonomy, biology, and chemistry of these secondary metabolites. It also summarizes the biosynthetic synthesis of metabolites, including that of Hup. A. The review will aid researchers in obtaining a clearer understanding of this plant-endophyte relationship to better exploit the excellent resources it offers that may be utilized by pharmaceutical industries.","J","Cao, D; Sun, P; Bhowmick, S; Wei, YH; Guo, B; Wei, YH; Mur, LAJ; Sun, ZL",NA,"","","Cao, Duo; Sun, Peng; Bhowmick, Sumana; Wei, Yahui; Guo, Bin; Wei, Yanhong; Mur, Luis A.

Evidently, such endophytes can be important in developing more sustainable agricultural practices. The mechanisms playing a role in this quantitative antagonism are poorly understood but most likely multifactorial. This knowledge gap obstructs the progress regarding the development of endophytes or endophyte-derived constituents into biocontrol agents. In part, this may be caused by the fact that endophytic fungi form a rather heterogeneous group. By combining the knowledge of the currently characterized antagonistic endophytic fungi and their effects on nematode behavior and biology with the knowledge of microbial competition and induced plant defenses, the various mechanisms by which this nematode antagonism operates or may operate are discussed.

"104","Review","Endophytic fungi, mostly belonging to the Ascomycota, are found in the intercellular spaces of the aerial plant parts, particularly in leaf sheaths, sometimes even within the bark and root system without inducing any visual symptoms of their presence. These fungi appear to have a capacity to produce a wide range of enzymes and secondary metabolites exhibiting a variety of biological activities. However, they have been only barely exploited as sources of enzymes of industrial interest. This review emphasizes the suitability and possible advantages of including the endophytic fungi in the screening of new enzyme producing organisms as well as in studies aiming to optimize the production of enzymes through well-known culture processes. Apparently endophytic fungi possess the two types of extracellular enzymatic systems necessary to degrade the vegetal biomass: (1) the hydrolytic system responsible for polysaccharide degradation consisting mainly in xylanases and cellulases; and (2) the unique oxidative ligninolytic system, which degrades lignin and opens phenyl rings, comprises mainly laccases, ligninases and peroxidases. The obvious ability of endophytic fungi to degrade the complex structure of lignocellulose makes them useful in the exploration of the lignocellulosic biomass for the production of fuel ethanol and other value-added commodity chemicals. In addition to this, endophytic fungi may become new sources of industrially useful enzymes such as lipases, amylases and proteases.","J","Corrêa, RCG; Rhoden, SA; Mota, TR; Azevedo, JL; Pamphile, JA; de Souza, CGM; Polizeli, MDTD; Bracht, A; Peralta, RM",NA,"","","Gomes Correa, Rubia Carvalho; Rhoden, Sandro Augusto; Mota, Thatiane Rodrigues; Azevedo, Joao Lucio; Pamphile, Joao Alencar; Marques de Souza, Cristina Giatti; Teixeira de Moraes Polizeli, Maria de Lourdes; Bracht, Adelar; Peralta, Rosane Marina",NA,NA,"Endophytic fungi: expanding the arsenal of industrial enzyme producers","JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Azevedo, João L/F-3548-2015; de Lourdes T.M.

In this chapter, we critically review the production of a wide range of secondary metabolites, bioactive compounds from fungal endophytes that are a potential alternative source of secondary plant metabolites and natural producers of high-demand drugs. One of the major areas in endophytic research that holds both economic and environmental potential is bioremediation. During their life span, microbes adapt fast to environmental pollutants and remediate their surrounding microenvironment. In the last two decades, bioremediation has arisen as a suitable alternative for remediating large polluted sites. Endophytic fungi producing ligninolytic enzymes have possible biotechnological applications in lignocellulosic biorefineries.

"106","Review","Across the globe, cancer is the second most significant cause for mortality that was responsible for 8.8 million deaths in 2015, and the count is increasing at the alarming pace each year. The longer treatment protocols and the serious side effects of the existing anticancer drugs represent an urgent need to develop safe and effective anticancer drugs. Endophytic fungi offer the prolific source of novel metabolites that bears unique structural and functional capabilities with cytotoxic activity. In recent years, various bioactive metabolites possessing structural diversity have been identified from endophytic fungi and evaluated for their anticancer properties. Bioactive metabolites from endophytic fungi have potential to serve as a lead molecule for the pharmacological sector in the development of new drugs. The lower yield of metabolites is a major barrier for the utilization of these molecules for the treatment of cancer; therefore, alternate sources and production methods have been developed. The culture optimization to enhance yield and epigenetic means to activate silenced genes capable of producing novel metabolites were developed to obtain the fungal metabolites in higher quantities. The present review provides a comprehensive data of bioactive metabolites isolated from endophytic fungi harboring terrestrial plants during 2012-2018 (up to June 2018) with focus on their chemical structure, their cytotoxic capabilities, and their mechanism of action.

Thus, a considerable shift towards eco-friendly products has been seen in medicine, pharmacy, agriculture and several other vital sectors. Nowadays, studies on endophytic fungi and their biotechnological potentials are in high demand due to their substantial, cost-effective and eco-friendly contributions in the discovery of an array of secondary metabolites. For this review, we provide a brief overview of plant-endophytic fungi interactions and we also state the history of the discovery of the untapped potentialities of fungal secondary metabolites. Then, we highlight the huge importance of the discovered metabolites and their versatile applications in several vital fields including medicine, pharmacy, agriculture, industry and bioremediation. We then focus on the challenges and on the possible methods and techniques that can be used to help in the discovery of novel secondary metabolites. The latter range from endophytic selection and culture media optimization to more in-depth strategies such as omics, ribosome engineering and epigenetic remodeling.","J","Ben Slama, H; Bouket, AC; Alenezi, FN; Pourhassan, Z; Golinska, P; Oszako, T; Belbahri, L",NA,"","","Ben Slama, Houda; Bouket, Ali Chenari; Alenezi, Faizah N.; Pourhassan, Zeinab; Golinska, Patrycja; Oszako, Tomasz; Belbahri, Lassaad",NA,NA,"Potentials of Endophytic Fungi in the Biosynthesis of Versatile Secondary Metabolites and Enzymes","FORESTS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Golinska, Patrycja/G-4206-2014; Lassaad, Belbahri/E-1648-2015; alenezi, Dr. Faizah/IUM-1433-2023; Chenari Bouket, Ali/C-9971-2017; Oszako, Tomasz/P-3955-2016","Golinska, Patrycja/0000-0001-9154-8191; Chenari Bouket, Ali/0000-0002-8421-1758; Oszako, Tomasz/0000-0003-4688-2582; Ben Slama, Houda/0000-0001-5899-5483",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","1999-4907","",NA,NA,"DEC",2021,12,"12",NA,"","",NA,"","","1784","10.3390/f12121784","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f12121784","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000738993200001","View Full Record in Web of Science",317,NA
"108","Presence","Endophytic fungi occupy various ecological niches, which reinforces their diversity. As few studies have investigated the endophytic fungi of alpine conifers, we focused on four species of alpine conifers in this study-Abies nephrolepis, Pinus pumila, Taxus cuspidata var. nana, and Thuja koraiensis-and examined them for endophytic fungi. A total of 108 endophytic fungi were isolated. There were four taxa in A. nephrolepis, 12 in P. pumila, 18 in T. cuspidata var. nana, and 17 in T. koraiensis; these were divided into five classes: Agaricomycetes (3.2%), Dothideomycetes (29.0%), Leotiomycetes (15.0%), Sordariomycetes (41.9%), and Orbiliomycetes (1.6%). The most prevalent fungi were Sydowia polyspora (22.7%) and Xylariaceae sp. (22.7%) in P. pumila, Phomopsis juglandina (16.1%) in T. cuspidata var. nana, and Thuja-endophytes sp. 1 (70.0%) in T. koraiensis. However, there was no dominant species growing in A. nephrolepis. Some host plants were analyzed using next-generation sequencing. We obtained 4618 reads for A. nephrolepis and 2268 reads for T. koraiensis. At the genus level, the top three endophytic fungi were Ophiostomataceae_uc (64.6%), Nectriaceae_uc (15.5%), and unclassified organism (18.0%) in A. nephrolepis and Nectriaceae_uc (41.9%), Ophiostomataceae_uc (41.8%), and Magnaporthaceae_uc (9.2%) in T. koraiensis. Our results show that there are different communities of endophytic fungi among different host plants, even if the host plants are in the same region. Such ecological niches are important in terms of the ecological restoration of alpine conifers.","J","Eo, JK; Eom, AH",NA,"","","Eo, Ju-Kyeong; Eom, Ahn-Heum",NA,NA,"Community of Endophytic Fungi from Alpine Conifers on Mt.

A total of 101 isolates obtained from the roots, stems and leaves of P. lactiflora were grouped into 16 fungal taxa based on morphological traits and internal transcribed spacers sequences, indicating that endophytic fungi of P. lactiflora are abundant and diverse. The dominant endophytic fungi were Aspergillus, Alternaria and Penicillium. More fungi were recovered from leaves than from roots and stems. The similarity index was highest between the stems and leaves (0.733), followed by the roots and leaves (0.615) and the stems and roots (0.563). Analyses of the fermentation extracts of 22 endophytic fungi by high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry revealed that three strains (R12, Alternaria tenuissima; S4, Aspergillus flavus; and R17 Penicillium commune) were able to produce paeoniflorin. Among the paeoniflorin-producing fungi, the yield of paeoniflorin from A. flavus S4 was 342.4 mu g/L, and this strain could be used as a candidate for the industrial production of paeoniflorin.","J","Cheng, XZ; Wei, ZW; Pu, SC; Min-Xiang; Yan, AL; Zhang, Y; Wang, XM",NA,"","","Cheng, Xiaozhong; Wei, Zhiwen; Pu, Shunchang; Min-Xiang; Yan, Aolei; Zhang, Yu; Wang, Xiaomei",NA,NA,"Diversity of endophytic fungi of Paeonia lactiflora Pallas and screening for fungal paeoniflorin producers","FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"wang, xiao/HZI-9156-2023; Pu, Shun chang/AAA-4701-2022; Li, June/JEF-1173-2023","Pu, Shun chang/0000-0002-6349-4875;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0378-1097","1574-6968","",NA,NA,"DEC",2018,365,"24",NA,"","",NA,"","","fny263","10.1093/femsle/fny263","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/femsle/fny263","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30445580,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000456621300004","View Full Record in Web of Science",319,NA

A total of 123 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated from different plant tissues of DZW. Among them, the strain Fusarium sp. (CPCC 400709) showed the best activity of hydrolyzing steroidal saponins in DZW into diosgenin. Thus, this strain was used to prepare diosgenin from DZW by solid-state fermentation. The fermentation parameters were optimized using response surface methodology, and a high yield of diosgenin (2.16%) was obtained at 14.5% ammonium sulfate, an inoculum size of 12.3%, and 22 days of fermentation. Furthermore, the highest diosgenin yield (2.79%) was obtained by co-fermentation with Fusarium sp.

"113","Presence","Microorganisms are essential for human life. Since time immemorial, every process on earth has been affected by an unending ability of microorganisms to renovate the world. From the last two decades, microbes residing inside plants have gained special attention, and are called endophytes. These microbes have natural potential for production of various bioactive secondary metabolites and can be directly or indi-rectly used as therapeutic agents against a plethora of maladies. For this purpose, endophytic fungi were iso-lated and identified from different healthy, wild and cultivated plants. They were tested against common laboratory bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli) and they showed strong antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria. Most effective isolates of endophytic fungi were further studied for characterization of their organic compounds. Oily n -hexane extract from mycelium and n-hexane fraction of culture filtrates of endophytic fungus Talaromyces trachyspermus revealed the presence of several compounds. The identification of bioactive compounds by GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) is based on the molecular weights, peak areas, mass frag-mentations and retention times. Most of these compounds have therapeutic properties and are used in the pharmaceutical field. The major bioactive compounds, eicosane, oleic Acid, n-hexadecanoic acid, ethyl Oleate, cis-vaccenic acid, heptacosane identified from T. trachyspermus have been reported to possess antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and nematicidal properties. These results will lead to further in-depth research towards the potential use of this endophytic fungus and their bio-constituents can be further isolated and used in therapeutic applications.(c) 2022 SAAB.

"114","Review","Weeds represent one of the most challenging biotic factors for the agricultural sector, responsible for causing significant losses in important agricultural crops. Traditional herbicides have managed to keep weeds at bay, but overuse has resulted in negative environmental and toxicological impacts, including the increase of herbicide-resistant species. Within this context, the use of biologically derived (bio-)herbicides represents a promising solution because they are able to provide the desired phytotoxic effects while causing less toxic environmental damage. In recent years, bioactive secondary metabolites, in particular those bio-synthesized by endophytic fungi, have been shown to be promising sources of novel compounds that can be exploited in agriculture, including their use in weed control. Endophytic fungi have the ability to produce volatile and nonvolatile compounds with broad phytotoxic activity. In addition, as a result of the beneficial relationships they establish with their host plants, they are part of the colonization mechanism and can provide protection for their hosts. As such, endophytic fungi can be exploited as bioherbicides and as research tools. In this review, we cover 100 nonvolatile secondary metabolites with phytotoxic activity and more than 20 volatile organic compounds in a mixture, produced by 28 isolates of endophytic fungi from 21 host plant families, collected in 8 countries. This information can form the basis for the application of endophytic fungal compounds in weed control.","J","Macías-Rubalcava, ML; Garrido-Santos, MY",NA,"","","Macias-Rubalcava, Martha Lydia; Garrido-Santos, Monserrat Yesenia",NA,NA,"Phytotoxic compounds from endophytic fungi","APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0175-7598","1432-0614","",NA,NA,"FEB",2022,106,"3",NA,"","",NA,"931","950","","10.1007/s00253-022-11773-w","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-022-11773-w","","22-Jan",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35039926,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000743425000002","View Full Record in Web of Science",324,NA

Rice production has seen exponential growth with time; as of now, it is the third highest-produced agricultural commodity. However, the recent climate changes have gravely affected rice cultivation, leaving future production skeptical. In such atypical circumstances, the utilization of a unique symbiotic association of endophytic fungi and plants represents a sustainable alternative. Endophytic fungi are of crucial importance to the nutrient cycle of the plant, and it can be anticipated that no synthetic molecule can provide the plant with such a wide range of benefits. Over the last decade, numerous studies have reported the ability of endophytic fungi to colonize rice plants successfully. These endophytes exhibit various properties, such as phytohormone production, mineral solubilization, and siderophore production. In addition, they also compensate for environ-mental constraints. This review highlights the work using endophytic fungi to improve rice cultivation over the last decade.

Previous studies have indicated that host identity and host habitat are contributing factors, but these factors are often difficult to disentangle. In this study, we studied FEF assemblages from plants grown in a botanical garden, enabling us to minimize the variation in abiotic environmental conditions and fungal dispersal capacity. FEF assemblages from 46 Ficus species were sequenced using next-generation methods, and the results indicated that closely related host species had clearly differentiated FEF assemblages. Furthermore, host phylogenetic proximity was significantly correlated with the similarity of their FEF assemblages. In the canonical correspondence analysis, eleven leaf traits explained 32.9% of the total variation in FEF assemblages, whereas six traits (specific leaf area, leaf N content, leaf pH, toughness, latex alkaloid content, and latex volume per leaf area) were significant in the first two dimensions of ordination space. In the multiple regression on distance matrix analysis, 21.0% of the total variance in FEF assemblage was explained by both host phylogeny and leaf traits while phylogeny alone explained 7.9% of the variance. Thus, our findings suggest that both evolutionary and ecological processes are involved in shaping FEF assemblages.","J","Liu, JW; Zhao, J; Wang, G; Chen, J",NA,"","","Liu, Junwei; Zhao, Jin; Wang, Gang; Chen, Jin",NA,NA,"Host identity and phylogeny shape the foliar endophytic fungal assemblages of Ficus","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"wang, gang/ITT-0670-2023; Lu, Jianhong/IYT-3322-2023; Jiang, Cheng/JHU-0179-2023","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2045-7758","","",NA,NA,"SEP",2019,9,"18",NA,"","",NA,"10472","10482","","10.1002/ece3.5568","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.5568","","AUG 2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31624561,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000481062000001","View Full Record in Web of Science",384,NA

"126","Both","Endophytic fungi live symbiotically in the tissues of plants. Although a large amount of evidence suggests a mutualistic role for vertically transmitted endophytic fungi in agronomic grasses, the role of horizontally transmitted endophytic fungi as mutualists has been challenged. Recent studies, however, have shown that horizontally transmitted endophytic fungi can act as mutualists to their plant hosts by providing defense against pathogens and defoliators. In particular, several experimental studies have shown that endophytic fungi interact negatively with leaf-cutting ants and their fungal cultivar, but these studies were performed under laboratory conditions. Using field colonies of Atta colombica in Central Panama, we measured the fungal endophyte content in the forage material of leaf-cutting ants and compared it to ambient endophyte levels. We then used the collected data to model the area of plant material containing endophytes that enters a mature colony daily. We found that mature colonies collect leaf material that is 20% lower in endophyte abundance than surrounding leaves. A similar pattern was observed for newly emerged colonies. Our model suggests that via ant foraging preferences, leaf-cutting ants reduce the possible area of material containing endophytes entering the colony by 33%. Our results provide further evidence for a negative interaction between leaf-cutting ants and horizontally transmitted endophytes, suggesting that fungal endophytes have a defensive role in tropical plants by influencing leaf-cutting ant foraging preferences.","J","Coblentz, KE; Van Bael, SA",NA,"","","Coblentz, Kyle E.; Van Bael, Sunshine A.",NA,NA,"Field colonies of leaf-cutting ants select plant materials containing low abundances of endophytic fungi","ECOSPHERE","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Coblentz, Kyle/AAU-5549-2021; Van Bael, Sunshine/K-1930-2019; Van Bael, Sunshine/M-5370-2019","Coblentz, Kyle/0000-0002-0069-8491; Van Bael, Sunshine/0000-0001-7317-3533",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2150-8925","","",NA,NA,"MAY",2013,4,"5",NA,"","",NA,"","","66","10.1890/ES13-00012.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/ES13-00012.1","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000327308300015","View Full Record in Web of Science",89,"Both"

However, changes in habitat may influence also the quality of giant panda diet through the bamboo species composition as well as their symbiotic leaf endophytes and plant chemical properties. Here we explore species composition and frequency of endophytic fungi and silica content in different bamboo species in the range of giant panda habitat in relation to panda food preference. Silica content of the bamboos varied from 3.7 g/kg to 45.7 g/kg and did not correlate with panda preference and altitudinal gradient. Systemic and vertically in seeds transmitted fungal endophytes or bacterial endophytes were not detected in bamboo leaves. Nearly half of the identified endophytic fungi belonged to genus Arthrinium. Pandas preferred bamboo species naturally occurring in higher altitudes. Furthermore, the total amount of endophytes tended to be lower in samples collected from bamboos in higher altitudes.

"128","Presence","Foliar fungal endophytes are ubiquitous, but understudied symbionts of most plant species; relatively little is known about the factors affecting their occurrence, diversity and abundance.

In the first study, we assessed relationships between soil moisture, organic matter, carbon and nitrogen content and plant water, nitrogen and carbon content and AM colonization and the occurrence of foliar endophytic fungal species. In the second study, we manipulated soil nutrient content and AM colonization of potted seedlings and identified differences in endophytic fungal species composition of the leaves and stems. The results reveal that endophytes can occur either more or less frequently, de-pending on soil nutrient and plant water content and AM colonization. We propose that these patterns were the result of differences in fungal growth responses to nutrient availability in the leaves, which can be affected by resources obtained from the soil or symbiotic fungi in the roots.

It is unclear how dust deposition affects plant-associated microbiomes in downwind ecosystems. Here we show that dust deposition may negatively influence the isolation, richness, and diversity of endophytic fungal communities of Persian oak. We used culture-based methods paired with Sanger sequencing to examine these effects on fungal assemblages isolated from leaf, branch and deposited dust. Increased amounts of dust deposition led to decreased endophytic fungal diversity in plant tissues but increased fungal diversity in deposited dust layers on leaves. Dust deposition decreased the abundance of a dominant endophyte in branches with promising biocontrol properties. Endophytic fungal communities found in leaves were more similar to fungal assemblages of deposited dust in comparison to branch endophytes. Our results suggest that dust storms may have ecosystem-wide effects by altering the fungal microbiomes of forest-forming trees. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

"132","Review","Plant-associated endophytes define an important symbiotic association in nature and are established bio-reservoirs of plant-derived natural products. Endophytes colonize the internal tissues of a plant without causing any disease symptoms or apparent changes. Recently, there has been a growing interest in endophytes because of their beneficial effects on the production of novel metabolites of pharmacological significance. Studies have highlighted the socio-economic implications of endophytic fungi in agriculture, medicine, and the environment, with considerable success. Endophytic fungi-mediated biosynthesis of well-known metabolites includes taxol from Taxomyces andreanae, azadirachtin A and B from Eupenicillium parvum, vincristine from Fusarium oxysporum, and quinine from Phomopsis sp. The discovery of the billion-dollar anticancer drug taxol was a landmark in endophyte biology/research and established new paradigms for the metabolic potential of plant-associated endophytes. In addition, endophytic fungi have emerged as potential prolific producers of antimicrobials, antiseptics, and antibiotics of plant origin. Although extensively studied as a production platform of novel pharmacological metabolites, the molecular mechanisms of plant-endophyte dynamics remain less understood/explored for their efficient utilization in drug discovery. The emerging trends in endophytic fungi-mediated biosynthesis of novel bioactive metabolites, success stories of key pharmacological metabolites, strategies to overcome the existing challenges in endophyte biology, and future direction in endophytic fungi-based drug discovery forms the underlying theme of this article.","J","Tiwari, P; Bae, H",NA,"","","Tiwari, Pragya; Bae, Hanhong",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungi: Key Insights, Emerging Prospects, and Challenges in Natural Product Drug Discovery","MICROORGANISMS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2076-2607","",NA,NA,"FEB",2022,10,"2",NA,"","",NA,"","","360","10.3390/microorganisms10020360","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10020360","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35208814,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000778712500001","View Full Record in Web of Science",98,"Review"

"134","Review","The biotransformation reactions are used as a successful alternative to derivatization by the traditional chemistry because they conduct to uncommon reactions, which would hardly be carried out by chemical synthesis. A wide diversity of compounds may be metabolized by fungi, leading to chemical derivatives through selective reactions that work under ecofriendly conditions. Endophytic fungi live in symbiosis with health tissues of plants. The employment of endophytic fungi as enzymatic sources to biotransformation reactions is very promising since these microorganisms came from uncommon and underexplored habitat. The environmental conditions directly influence the composition of the endophytic microbiota and its genetic expression, which could change also the production of the enzymes. The extraordinary richness of the Brazilian biodiversity is a key factor in the diversification of the endophytic community. The present review presents a mapping of the biotransformation reactions catalyzed by Brazilian endophytic fungi. Our findings contribute both to the appreciation of these fungi in the chemical derivatization and for the preservation of the Brazilian species.","J","dos Santos, VHP; Silva, ED",NA,"","","Pereira dos Santos, Valmore Henrique; Silva, Eliane de Oliveira",NA,NA,"ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI FROM THE BRAZILIAN FLORA AND THEIR EMPLOYMENT IN BIOTRANSFORMATION REACTIONS","QUIMICA NOVA","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Silva, Eliane/S-2675-2019","Silva, Eliane/0000-0001-9121-0481",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0100-4042","1678-7064","",NA,NA,"AUG",2019,42,"7",NA,"","",NA,"784","791","","10.21577/0100-4042.20170380","http://dx.doi.org/10.21577/0100-4042.20170380","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000483079600009","View Full Record in Web of Science",131,"Review"
"135","Review","Success of targeted cancer treatment modalities has generated an ambience of plausible cure for cancer. However, cancer remains to be the major cause of mortality across the globe. The emergence of chemoresistance, relapse after treatment and associated adverse effects has posed challenges to the present therapeutic regimes. Thus, investigating new therapeutic agents of natural origin and delineating the underlying mechanism of action is necessary. Since ages and still in continuum, the phytochemicals have been the prime source of identifying bioactive agents against cancer. They have been exploited for isolating targeted specific compounds to modulate the key regulating signaling pathways of cancer pathogenesis and progression. Capsaicin (alkaloid compound in chilli), catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (phytochemicals in green tea), lutein (carotenoid found in yellow fruits), Garcinol (phenolic compound present in kokum tree) and many other naturally available compounds are also very valuable to develop the drugs to treat the cancer. An alternate repository of similar chemical diversity exists in the form of endophytic fungi inhabiting the medicinal plants. There is a high diversity of plant associated endophytic fungi in nature which are potent producers of anti-cancer compounds and offers even stronger hope for the discovery of an efficient anti-cancer drug. These fungi provide various bioactive molecules, such as terpenoids, flavonoids, alkaloids, phenolic compounds, quinines, steroids etc. exhibiting anti-cancerous property. The review discusses the relevance of phytochemicals in chemoprevention and as modulators of miRNA. The perspective advocates the imperative role of anti-cancerous secondary metabolites containing repository of endophytic fungi, as an alternative route of drug discovery.","J","Tyagi, G; Kapoor, N; Chandra, G; Gambhir, L",NA,"","","Tyagi, Garima; Kapoor, Neha; Chandra, Girish; Gambhir, Lokesh",NA,NA,"Cure lies in nature: medicinal plants and endophytic fungi in curbing cancer","3 BIOTECH","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gambhir, Dr Lokesh/AAR-6374-2020; Kapoor, Dr. Neha/JMR-0589-2023","Gambhir, Dr Lokesh/0000-0003-3069-4456; Kapoor, Dr. Neha/0000-0002-9574-7056",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2190-572X","2190-5738","",NA,NA,"JUN",2021,11,"6",NA,"","",NA,"","","263","10.1007/s13205-021-02803-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13205-021-02803-x","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33996375,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000761700400005","View Full Record in Web of Science",277,"Review"

"137","Review","L-asparaginase is a tetrameric enzyme from the amidohydrolases family, that catalyzes the breakdown of L-asparagine into L-aspartic acid and ammonia. Since its discovery as an anticancer drug, it is used as one of the prime chemotherapeutic agents to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Apart from its use in the biopharmaceutical industry, it is also used to reduce the formation of a carcinogenic substance called acrylamide in fried, baked, and roasted foods. L-asparaginase is derived from many organisms including plants, bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes. Currently, L-asparaginase preparations from Escherichia coli and Erwinia chrysanthemi are used in the clinical treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, they are associated with low yield and immunogenicity problems. At this juncture, endophytic fungi from medicinal plants have gained much attention as they have several advantages over the available bacterial preparations. Many medicinal plants have been screened for L-asparaginase producing endophytic fungi and several studies have reported potent L-asparaginase producing strains. This review provides insights into fungal endophytes from medicinal plants and their significance as probable alternatives for bacterial L-asparaginase.","J","Parashiva, J; Nuthan, BR; Rakshith, D; Satish, S",NA,"","","Parashiva, Javaraiah; Nuthan, Bettadapura Rameshgowda; Rakshith, Devaraju; Satish, Sreedharamurthy",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungi as a Promising Source of Anticancer L-Asparaginase: A Review","CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Satish, Sreedharamurthy/0000-0003-1164-4701",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0343-8651","1432-0991","",NA,NA,"SEP",2023,80,"9",NA,"","",NA,"","","282","10.1007/s00284-023-03392-z","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-023-03392-z","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37450223,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001030541200001","View Full Record in Web of Science",528,"Review"
"138","Review","Plants are all inhabited by endophytic fungi in the interior of their tissues. The neem tree Azadirachta is an Indian lilac used for various therapeutic purposes in different forms of preparations. This plant hosts different types of endophytic fungi. In some cases, different tissues of a given plant are inhabited by different endophytic fungi which are discussed in this paper. Recently, there have been new reports on endophytic fungi and their bioactive compounds from Azadirachta indica. The biological function of bioactive compounds was discussed in view of their future industrial prospects. There are a number of different research investigations that examine the endophytes isolated and screened for their potential bioactive secondary metabolites from neem, but there is no comprehensive review on neem endophytes and their secondary metabolites to bring all trends from different researchers together. Therefore, in this review, we have discussed the endophytic fungi from the different tissues of neem, in view of the latest understandings of antimicrobial, antioxidant, and pathogenicity target compounds. Importantly, tracing the previous findings would pave the way to forecast the missing link for future work by researchers.","J","Chutulo, EC; Chalannavar, RK",NA,"","","Chutulo, Eyob Chukalo; Chalannavar, Raju Krishna",NA,NA,"Endophytic Mycoflora and Their Bioactive Compounds from Azadirachta Indica: A Comprehensive Review","JOURNAL OF FUNGI","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Chalannavar, Raju/AAL-8126-2020","Chutulo, Eyob Chukalo/0000-0002-8548-2509; Chalannavar, Raju/0000-0001-6682-4537",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2309-608X","",NA,NA,"JUN",2018,4,"2",NA,"","",NA,"","","42","10.3390/jof4020042","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof4020042","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29587361,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000452634900003","View Full Record in Web of Science",692,"Review"
"139","Review","Fungal endophytes constitute a major part of the unexplored fungal diversity. Endophytic fungi (EF) are an important source for novel, potential and active metabolites. Plant-endophyte interaction and endophyte -endophyte interactions study provide insights into mutualism and metabolite production by fungi. Bioactive compounds produced by endophytes main function are helping the host plants to resist external biotic and abiotic stress, which benefit the host survival in return. These organisms mainly consist of members of the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Zygomycota and Oomycota. Recently, the genome sequencing technology has emerged as one of the most efficient tools that can provide whole information of a genome in a small period of time. Endophytes are fertile ground for drug discovery. EFare considered as the hidden members of the microbial world and represent an underutilized resource for new therapeutics and compounds. Endophytes are rich source of natural products displaying broad spectrum of biological activities like anticancer, antibacterial, antiviral, immunomodulatory, antidiabetic, antioxidant, anti-arthritis and anti-inflammatory.","J","Rajamanikyam, M; Vadlapudi, V; Amanchy, R; Upadhyayula, SM",NA,"","","Rajamanikyam, Maheshwari; Vadlapudi, Varahalarao; Amanchy, Ramars; Upadhyayula, Suryanarayana Murty",NA,NA,"Endophytic Fungi as Novel Resources of natural Therapeutics","BRAZILIAN ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Amanchy, Ramars/K-1273-2016","Amanchy, Ramars/0000-0001-9315-8488; vadlapudi, varahalarao/0000-0003-1133-659X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1516-8913","1678-4324","",NA,NA,"JAN-DEC",2017,60,"",NA,"","",NA,"","","e17160542","10.1590/1678-4324-2017160542","http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1678-4324-2017160542","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000410081700001","View Full Record in Web of Science",774,"Review"
