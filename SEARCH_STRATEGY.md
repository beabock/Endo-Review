## Project: Endophyte Research Systematic Review
**Principal Investigator**: B. Bock  
**Institution**: Northern Arizona University  
**Project Timeline**: 2025

## Search Evolution History

### Phase 1: Initial Exploratory Search
- **Date**: [Initial project start - exact date from project records]
- **Purpose**: Preliminary scope assessment and model training data
- **Strategy**: `Endophyt* AND (fung* OR mycolog*)`
- **Database**: Web of Science Core Collection
- **Limitations Identified**:
  - Overly broad capture (included bacterial endophytes)
  - Limited host organism diversity
  - Potential false positives from mycological studies without plant association

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Systematic Review Search
- **Date**: July 31, 2025
- **Purpose**: Final comprehensive dataset for systematic review and analysis
- **Strategy**: 
  ```
  ("fungal endophyte" OR "fungal endophytes" OR "endophytic fungus" OR "endophytic fungi")
  AND
  (plant* OR moss* OR bryophyte* OR liverwort* OR hornwort* OR fern* OR lycophyte* OR pteridophyte* OR algae OR green alga* OR macroalga* OR cyanobacteria OR cyanobiont* OR photobiont* OR lichen*)
  ```
- **Database**: Web of Science Core Collection
- **Search Date**: July 31, 2025
- **Status**: **CURRENT DATASET FOR ALL ANALYSES**

## Detailed Search Strategy Rationale (Phase 2)

### Target Concept 1: Fungal Endophytes (Precision Enhancement)

**Included Terms:**
- `"fungal endophyte"` - Most direct terminology
- `"fungal endophytes"` - Plural form
- `"endophytic fungus"` - Alternative phrasing
- `"endophytic fungi"` - Plural alternative

**Rationale:**
- **Precision over Recall**: Eliminates bacterial endophyte studies
- **Standard Terminology**: Captures most common field-specific language
- **Reduced Ambiguity**: Avoids captures of "endophyte" in non-fungal contexts

### Target Concept 2: Host Organisms (Scope Expansion)

**Plant Groups Included:**

1. **Vascular Plants**
   - `plant*` - Captures plant, plants, Plantae, plantation, etc.

2. **Bryophytes (Non-vascular plants)**
   - `moss*` - Mosses
   - `bryophyte*` - General bryophyte terminology
   - `liverwort*` - Hepatics
   - `hornwort*` - Anthocerotophytes

3. **Pteridophytes (Ferns and allies)**
   - `fern*` - Ferns
   - `lycophyte*` - Club mosses and relatives
   - `pteridophyte*` - General pteridophyte terminology

4. **Algae and Algal Systems**
   - `algae` - General algae
   - `green alga*` - Chlorophytes
   - `macroalga*` - Seaweeds

5. **Symbiotic Photosynthetic Systems**
   - `cyanobacteria` - Blue-green algae (can host fungal endophytes)
   - `cyanobiont*` - Cyanobacterial symbionts
   - `photobiont*` - Photosynthetic partners
   - `lichen*` - Lichen systems (complex fungal-algal associations)

**Rationale for Host Expansion:**
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Endophytes found across diverse photosynthetic organisms
- **Emerging Research**: Growing interest in endophytes of bryophytes and algae
- **Ecological Completeness**: Full spectrum of plant-fungal associations
- **Taxonomic Precision**: Specific terminology for different plant groups

## Expected Impact on Research

### Literature Coverage Enhancement
1. **Expanded Taxonomic Scope**: Inclusion of bryophyte and algal endophyte research
2. **Improved Precision**: Reduced false positives from bacterial endophyte studies
3. **Current Relevance**: Capture of emerging research areas in plant-fungal associations
4. **Global Representation**: Enhanced capture of diverse research terminologies

### Analytical Implications
1. **Diversity Assessment**: More comprehensive view of endophyte-host associations
2. **Ecological Patterns**: Better understanding of endophyte distribution across plant lineages
3. **Research Trends**: Identification of emerging research frontiers
4. **Geographic Coverage**: Potential for improved global research representation

## Limitations and Considerations

### Search Limitations
1. **Language Bias**: English-language focus may exclude regional research
2. **Database Coverage**: Limited to Web of Science indexed publications
3. **Terminology Evolution**: May miss older studies with different terminology
4. **Gray Literature**: Excludes theses, reports, and non-indexed publications

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Manual Validation**: Systematic review of classification results
2. **Expert Consultation**: Domain expert review of search strategy and results
3. **Reference Mining**: Review of citations from known relevant studies
4. **Transparency**: Full documentation of search methodology and limitations

## Future Considerations

### Potential Search Enhancements
1. **Multi-database Approach**: Integration with PubMed, Scopus, specialized databases
2. **Language Expansion**: Non-English literature inclusion with translation
3. **Temporal Updates**: Regular search updates for emerging literature
4. **Methodological Refinement**: Continuous improvement based on validation results

### Research Applications
1. **Systematic Review**: Primary data source for comprehensive literature analysis
2. **Meta-analysis**: Foundation for quantitative synthesis of research findings
3. **Research Gap Identification**: Basis for identifying understudied areas
4. **Future Research Planning**: Informed guidance for research prioritization
