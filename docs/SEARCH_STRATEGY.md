# Search Strategy Documentation

## Project: Testing the Universality of Fungal Endophytes in Plants
**Principal Investigator**: B. Bock  
**Institution**: Northern Arizona University  
**Project Timeline**: 2024-2025

## Research Context
This systematic review addresses the fundamental ecological question: **"Do all plant species harbor fungal endophytes?"** 

The claim of universal endophyte presence is frequently stated in the literature but often lacks proper citation or empirical support. This research aims to:
1. Test the universality hypothesis through comprehensive literature analysis
2. Identify evidence of endophyte absence across plant species and tissues
3. Assess taxonomic, geographic, and methodological biases in endophyte research
4. Evaluate the adequacy of detection methods for documenting true absence

**Operational Definition of "Absence"**: Studies that actively searched for fungal endophytes using appropriate methods but failed to detect any fungal presence (via culture, molecular, or microscopy approaches).

## Search Evolution History

### Phase 1: Initial Exploratory Search
- **Date**: Novemeber 18, 2024
- **Purpose**: Preliminary scope assessment and model training data
- **Strategy**: `("fungal endophyte" OR "fungal endophytes" OR "endophytic fungi" OR "endophytic fungus") AND plant`
- **Database**: Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus
- **Limitations Identified**:
  - Limited host organism diversity
  - Potential false positives from mycological studies without plant association

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Systematic Review Search
- **Date**: July 31, 2025
- **Purpose**: Final comprehensive dataset for systematic review and analysis
- **Strategy**: 
  ```
  ("fungal endophyte" OR "fungal endophytes" OR "endophytic fungus" OR "endophytic fungi" OR 
  "latent fungus" OR "latent fungi" OR "systemic fungus" OR "systemic fungi" OR 
  "internal fungi" OR "resident fungi" OR "seed-borne fungi" OR "seed-transmitted fungi" OR 
  "dark septate endophyte" OR "dark septate fungi" OR "DSE fungi")
  AND
  (plant* OR moss* OR bryophyte* OR liverwort* OR hornwort* OR fern* OR lycophyte* OR

## Detailed Search Strategy Rationale (Phase 2)

### Target Concept 1: Fungal Endophytes (Precision Enhancement)

**Included Terms:**
- `"fungal endophyte"` - Most direct terminology
- `"fungal endophytes"` - Plural form
- `"endophytic fungus"` - Alternative phrasing
- `"endophytic fungi"` - Plural alternative

**Rationale:**
- **Precision over Recall**: Eliminates bacterial endophyte studies
- **Standard Terminology**: Captures most common field-specific language
- **Reduced Ambiguity**: Avoids captures of "endophyte" in non-fungal contexts

### Target Concept 2: Host Organisms (Scope Expansion)

**Plant Groups Included:**

1. **Vascular Plants**
   - `plant*` - Captures plant, plants, Plantae etc.

2. **Bryophytes (Non-vascular plants)**
   - `moss*` - Mosses
   - `bryophyte*` - General bryophyte terminology
   - `liverwort*` - Hepatics
   - `hornwort*` - Anthocerotophytes

3. **Pteridophytes (Ferns and allies)**
   - `fern*` - Ferns
   - `lycophyte*` - Club mosses and relatives
   - `pteridophyte*` - General pteridophyte terminology

4. **Algae and Algal Systems**
   - `algae` - General algae
   - `green alga*` - Chlorophytes
   - `macroalga*` - Seaweeds

5. **Symbiotic Photosynthetic Systems**
   - `cyanobacteria` - Blue-green algae (can host fungal endophytes)
   - `cyanobiont*` - Cyanobacterial symbionts
   - `photobiont*` - Photosynthetic partners
   - `lichen*` - Lichen systems (complex fungal-algal associations)

**Rationale for Host Expansion:**
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Endophytes found across diverse photosynthetic organisms
- **Emerging Research**: Growing interest in endophytes of bryophytes and algae
- **Ecological Completeness**: Full spectrum of plant-fungal associations
- **Taxonomic Precision**: Specific terminology for different plant groups
