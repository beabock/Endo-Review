# Research Objectives and Framework

## Project: Testing the Universality of Fungal Endophytes in Plants
**Principal Investigator**: B. Bock  
**Institution**: Northern Arizona University  
**Project Timeline**: 2024-2025

---

## Central Research Question

**"Do all plant species harbor fungal endophytes?"**

This question addresses a fundamental ecological claim that is frequently stated in the literature but often lacks proper citation or is based on limited evidence. The universality assumption has major implications for understanding plant biology, evolution, and ecosystem functioning.

---

## Research Objectives

### Primary Objective
**Systematically evaluate the evidence for fungal endophyte universality across plant species** through comprehensive literature analysis, with particular attention to:
- **Species-level patterns**: Which plant species/taxa lack evidence of fungal endophytes?
- **Tissue-level universality**: Do all plant tissues harbor endophytes when examined?
- **Ecosystem-level patterns**: Are there environments/ecosystems where endophytes are consistently absent?

### Secondary Objectives
1. **Identify and quantify absence evidence**: Document studies that explicitly searched for but did not find fungal endophytes
2. **Assess research biases**: Quantify taxonomic, geographic, and methodological biases in endophyte research
3. **Evaluate methodological adequacy**: Assess whether absence findings reflect true absence or methodological limitations
4. **Map knowledge gaps**: Identify understudied plant groups and ecosystems

---

## Specific Research Questions

### 1. Evidence of Absence
- **Q1a**: What plant species/families have been examined for endophytes but found to harbor none?
- **Q1b**: What proportion of studies report negative results (no endophytes detected)?
- **Q1c**: How do negative results vary by detection method (culture vs molecular vs microscopy)?
- **Q1d**: Are negative results more common in certain plant tissues or developmental stages?

### 2. Methodological Considerations
- **Q2a**: What detection methods are most commonly used, and how might this bias absence/presence findings?
- **Q2b**: Do studies with negative results use adequate methodological rigor?
- **Q2c**: How do sample sizes and sampling strategies affect endophyte detection rates?
- **Q2d**: What is the relationship between detection method sophistication and endophyte discovery?

### 3. Taxonomic Patterns
- **Q3a**: Which plant families/orders are overrepresented vs underrepresented in endophyte research?
- **Q3b**: Are certain plant lineages consistently reported as endophyte-free?
- **Q3c**: How does endophyte presence/absence vary across major plant groups (bryophytes, ferns, gymnosperms, angiosperms)?
- **Q3d**: Do plant functional groups (trees, herbs, grasses) show different endophyte patterns?

### 4. Geographic and Ecological Patterns
- **Q4a**: Are there geographic regions where endophyte absence is more commonly reported?
- **Q4b**: Do extreme environments (arctic, desert, high elevation) show different endophyte patterns?
- **Q4c**: How do endophyte patterns vary across ecosystem types (forests, grasslands, wetlands)?
- **Q4d**: Is there evidence for latitudinal or climatic gradients in endophyte presence?

### 5. Research Bias Assessment
- **Q5a**: What is the extent of taxonomic bias toward economically important plants?
- **Q5b**: How pronounced is geographic bias toward temperate vs tropical regions?
- **Q5c**: Has methodological bias affected our understanding of endophyte universality?
- **Q5d**: Are negative results underrepresented due to publication bias?

## Conceptual Framework

### Defining "Absence"
**Operational Definition**: Studies that actively searched for fungal endophytes using appropriate methods but failed to detect any fungal presence.

**Inclusion Criteria for "Absence" Evidence**:
- Culture-based studies with no fungal growth after adequate incubation
- Molecular studies (PCR, sequencing) with no detectable fungal DNA/RNA
- Microscopy studies with no observable fungal structures
- Multi-method studies with consistent negative results across approaches

**Exclusion Criteria**:
- Studies that did not actively search for endophytes
- Studies with inadequate methodology (insufficient sampling, poor sterility, etc.)
- Studies focused only on specific endophyte taxa (e.g., only arbuscular mycorrhizae)

### Levels of Analysis

1. **Species Level**: Are there plant species that consistently lack fungal endophytes across studies?
2. **Tissue Level**: Within plants that harbor endophytes, are there tissues that remain endophyte-free?
3. **Ecosystem Level**: Are there ecosystem types or environmental conditions where endophytes are systematically absent?
4. **Temporal Level**: Do endophyte presence patterns vary seasonally or with plant development?

---

## Methodological Approach

### Literature Analysis Framework
1. **Comprehensive Search**: Systematic literature review using ML-assisted classification
2. **Evidence Extraction**: Automated and manual extraction of presence/absence data
3. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluation of methodological rigor for each study
4. **Bias Quantification**: Statistical analysis of research patterns and gaps
5. **Meta-Analysis**: Quantitative synthesis of endophyte presence/absence patterns

### Key Variables to Extract
- **Study Characteristics**: Location, methods, sample size, study quality
- **Plant Characteristics**: Species, family, tissue type, growth form, ecosystem
- **Endophyte Results**: Presence/absence, diversity, detection method
- **Environmental Context**: Climate, habitat, disturbance, seasonality

### Analytical Framework
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Patterns in endophyte presence/absence across taxa and regions
- **Bias Assessment**: Quantification of research effort across plant groups and regions
- **Comparative Analysis**: Methodological factors affecting detection success
- **Gap Analysis**: Identification of understudied groups and regions

## Expected Outcomes and Implications

### Scientific Contributions
1. **Empirical Test**: First comprehensive test of the "universal endophyte" hypothesis
2. **Knowledge Gaps**: Systematic identification of understudied plant groups and regions
3. **Methodological Insights**: Understanding of how detection methods affect absence/presence findings
4. **Bias Documentation**: Quantification of research biases affecting our understanding

### Broader Implications
1. **Evolutionary Biology**: Insights into the evolution and ecological significance of plant-fungal associations
2. **Ecosystem Ecology**: Understanding of fungal endophyte roles in ecosystem functioning
3. **Conservation Biology**: Identification of priority groups for endophyte research and conservation
4. **Agricultural Applications**: Implications for crop protection and sustainable agriculture

### Potential Findings
- **True Absence**: Some plant species/tissues may genuinely lack fungal endophytes
- **Methodological Artifacts**: Apparent absence may reflect inadequate detection methods
- **Ecological Patterns**: Environmental conditions may drive endophyte presence/absence
- **Research Bias**: Literature may be biased toward positive findings and certain plant groups

## Citation Analysis Framework (Proposed)

### Objective
Track how the "universal endophyte" claim propagates through the literature and assess its evidential basis.

### Approach
1. **Claim Identification**: Search for statements asserting endophyte universality
2. **Citation Tracking**: Follow citation chains to identify original sources
3. **Evidence Assessment**: Evaluate the empirical support for universality claims
4. **Propagation Analysis**: Document how claims spread and evolve through citations

### Key Questions
- What is the original source(s) of the universality claim?
- How often is the claim cited vs stated without citation?
- Has the claim become stronger/weaker over time?
- What evidence actually supports or contradicts the claim?

### Implementation Strategy
- **Text Mining**: Search abstracts/texts for universality statements
- **Citation Network Analysis**: Map citation relationships around key claims
- **Manual Verification**: Expert review of high-impact universality statements
- **Temporal Analysis**: Track claim evolution over time
