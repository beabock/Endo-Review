A total of 149 isolates of endophytic fungi representing 17 fungal taxa were obtained from 270 segments (90 from each stem, leaf and petiole) of this plant. Hyphomycetes (77.85%) were the most prevalent, followed by Ascomycetes (8.05%) and Coelomycetes (4.03%) respectively. A considerable amount of fungal isolates was kept under (10.07%) Mycelia-Sterilia (MS). Leaf harboured maximum colonization of endophytic fungi (72.22%) which was greater than stem (67.78%) and petiole (25.54%). The Jc similarity index was maximum (0.619) between stem vs leaf followed by leaf vs petiole (0.571) and stem vs petiole (0.428). The dominant endophytic fungi were Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Stenella agalis, Fusarium oxysporum, Curvularia lunata and Fusarium roseum. Among twelve endophytic fungi tested for antibacterial activity, crude extracts of nine endophytic fungi (75%), showed antibacterial potential against one or more clinical human pathogens. Alternaria alternata, Curvularia lunata, Penicillium sp. and Chaetomium globosum exhibited significant antibacterial activity against 4 of 5 tested pathogens, showing broad spectrum activity. This investigation explains the value of sampling from different tissues of a host plant for the greater species diversity, and additionally, the antibacterial screening of some endophytic fungi from this specific medicinal plant may represent a unique source for many of the useful antibacterial compounds.","Kharwar, RN; Verma, SK; Mishra, A; Gond, SK; Sharma, VK; Afreen, T; Kumar, A",NA,NA,NA,"Kharwar, Ravindra N.; Verma, Satish K.; Mishra, Ashish; Gond, Surendra K.; Sharma, Vijay K.; Afreen, Talat; Kumar, Anuj",NA,"Assessment of diversity, distribution and antibacterial activity of endophytic fungi isolated from a medicinal plant Adenocalymma alliaceum Miers",SYMBIOSIS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sharma, Vijay Kumar K/E-3541-2019; Gond, Surendra/ABB-6182-2021; Sharma, Vijay Kumar/J-5353-2019; Verma, Satish K./J-6398-2019","Sharma, Vijay Kumar K/0000-0002-2330-5830; Verma, Satish Kumar/0000-0003-4470-5398; Gond, Surendra/0000-0002-2737-9028; Afreen, Talat/0000-0003-3801-403X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0334-5114,1878-7665,NA,NA,NA,AUG,2011,55,1,NA,NA,NA,39,46,NA,10.1007/s13199-011-0142-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-011-0142-2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000298499300005,View Full Record in Web of Science,3,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The methodology of the selected studies was evaluated using GRADE. Protease production, optimization, purification, and characterization were the main evaluated outcomes. Of the 5540 initially gathered studies, 15 met the inclusion criteria after a two-step selection process. Only two studies optimized the protease production using statistical design and two reported enzyme purification and characterization. The genus Penicillium and Aspergillus were the most cited among the eleven different genera of endophytic fungi evaluated in the selected articles. Six studies proved the ability of some endophytic fungi to produce fibrinolytic proteases, demonstrating that endophytic fungi can be exploited for the further production of agents used in thrombolytic therapy.

The endophytic fungi of medicinal plants are a treasure house of natural compounds. However, there is a lack of research on the diversity and biological activity of endophytic fungi of AOJ. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to study the diversity of endophytic fungi in the roots and stems of AOJ, and endophytic fungi with a high output of phenols and flavonoids were screened by chromogenic reaction, and the antioxidant and antibacterial activities and chemical constituents of crude extracts of their fermentation broth were studied. A total of 3,426 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to 9 phyla, 27 classes, 64 orders, 152 families, and 277 genera were identified from AOJ. There were significant differences in the endophytic fungal communities of AOJ roots and stems, as well as in the endophytic fungal communities of triangular AOJ and circular AOJ. In addition, 31 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated from AOJ, of which 6 strains had good antioxidant and antibacterial activities. The crude extract of YG-2 had the strongest free radical scavenging ability and bacteriostatic ability, and its IC50 (DPPH), IC50 (ABTS), and IC50.OH values were 0.009 +/- 0.000 mg/mL, 0.023 +/- 0.002 mg/mL, and 0.081 +/- 0.006 mg/mL, respectively.

They also improve water and nutritional status leading to increased growth and fitness of host plants. Endophytes are rich sources of bioactive and secondary metabolites, making them promising candidates for the development of compounds with anticancer, antibiotic, antiviral, antidiabetic, and other pharmacological activities. Moreover, they produce various enzymes that hold economic and environmental potential for industrial applications. This study explored the diverse effects of endophytic fungi in agriculture, biofuels, medicine, industry and bioremediation.","Aleahmad, P; Ebrahimi, L",NA,NA,NA,"Aleahmad, Parmida; Ebrahimi, Leila",NA,The Possible Applications of Endophytic Fungi,RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOGNOSY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2345-4458,2345-5977,NA,NA,NA,NA,2023,10,4,NA,NA,NA,81,94,NA,10.22127/RJP.2023.179187,http://dx.doi.org/10.22127/RJP.2023.179187,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001081546900010,View Full Record in Web of Science,13,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14,,,Review,"Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that exist almost ubiquitously inside the various tissues of living plants where they act as an important reservoir of diverse bioactive compounds. Recently, endophytic fungi have drawn tremendous attention from researchers; their isolation, culture, purification, and characterization have revealed the presence of around 200 important and diverse compounds including anticancer agents, antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, immunosuppressants, and antimycotics. Many of these anticancer compounds, such as paclitaxel, camptothecin, vinblastine, vincristine, podophyllotoxin, and their derivatives, are currently being used clinically for the treatment of various cancers (e.g., ovarian, breast, prostate, lung cancers, and leukemias). By increasing the yield of specific compounds with genetic engineering and other biotechnologies, endophytic fungi could be a promising, prolific source of anticancer drugs. In the future, compounds derived from endophytic fungi could increase treatment availability and cost effectiveness. This comprehensive review includes the putative anticancer compounds from plant-derived endophytic fungi discovered from 1990 to 2020 with their source endophytic fungi and host plants as well as their antitumor activity against various cell lines.","Hridoy, M; Gorapi, MZH; Noor, S; Chowdhury, NS; Rahman, MM; Muscari, I; Masia, F; Adorisio, S; Delfino, DV; Mazid, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Hridoy, Md.; Gorapi, Md.

19,,,Review,"Endophytic fungi are a highly diverse group of fungi that intermittently colonize all plants without causing symptoms of the disease. They sense and respond to physiological and environmental changes of their host plant and microbiome. The inter-organism interactions are largely driven by chemical networks mediated by specialized metabolites. The balance of these complex interactions leads to healthy and strong host plants. Endophytic strains have particular machinery to produce a plethora of secondary metabolites with a variety of bioactivities and unknown functions in an ecological niche. Terpenoids play a key role in endophytism and represent an important source of bioactive molecules for human health and agriculture. In this review, we describe the role of endophytic fungi in plant health, fungal terpenoids in multiple interactions, and bioactive fungal terpenoids recently reported from endophytes, mainly from plants used in traditional medicine, as well as from algae and mangroves. Additionally, we highlight endophytic fungi as producers of important chemotherapeutic terpenoids, initially discovered in plants. Despite advances in understanding endophytism, we still have much to learn in this field. The study of the role, the evolution of interactions of endophytic fungi and their terpenoids provide an opportunity for better applications in human health and agriculture.","Galindo-Solis, JM; Fernandez, FJ",NA,NA,NA,"Galindo-Solis, Juan M.; Fernandez, Francisco J.",NA,Endophytic Fungal Terpenoids: Natural Role and Bioactivities,MICROORGANISMS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Fernandez, Francisco/L-3320-2015; GALINDO SOLIS, J.

Tetrastigma hemsleyanum is a traditional Chinese herb plant. The endophytic fungus strain TH15 isolated from root of T. hemsleyanum has been reported to significantly promote the growth of T. hemsleyanum. In this study, we combined HPLC-MS and ELISA to analyze the composition of TH15's fermentation broth. We also explored the effects of zearalenone, a metabolite of strain TH15, on the growth of T. hemsleyanum seedlings and expansin gene expression in root. Metabolomic analysis revealed that TH15 metabolites contained 5 phytohormones [indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), methyl indole-3-acetate (MeIAA), jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (JA-ILE) and salicylic acid (SA)], amino acids, sugar and vitamins. ELISA test indicated that TH15 metabolites contained zearalenone (ZEN). Supplement 0.1-0.5 mg/L ZEN into the culture medium promoted the growth of seedlings of T. hemsleyanum. Besides, ZEN treatment significantly promoted expression of the expansin gene in the root of T. hemsleyanum. The endophytic fungus strain TH15 secretes phytohormones like IAA, JA and SA, as well as other metabolites like ZEN. TH15's growth-promoting effects are realized by these secreted molecules' coordinated action.

32,,,Presence,"Background: Symbiotic interactions with fungal endophytes are argued to be responsible for the tolerance of plants to some stresses and for their adaptation to natural conditions. Aims: In this study we aimed to examine the endophytic fungal diversity associated with roots of date palms growing in coastal dune systems, and to screen this collection of endophytes for potential use as biocontrol agents, for antagonistic activity and mycoparasitism, and as producers of antifungal compounds with potential efficacy against root diseases of date palm. Methods: Roots of nine individual date palms growing in three coastal locations in the South-East of Spain (Guardamar, El Carabassl, and San Juan) were selected to isolate endophytic fungi. Isolates were identified on the basis of morphological and/or molecular characters. Results: Five hundred and fifty two endophytic fungi were isolated and assigned to thirty morphological taxa or molecular operational taxonomic units. Most isolates belonged to Ascomycota, and the dominant order was Hypocreales. Fusarium and Clonostachys were the most frequently isolated genera and were present at all sampling sites. Comparisons of the endophytic diversity with previous studies, and their importance in the management of the date palm crops are discussed. Conclusions: This is the first study on the diversity of endophytic fungi-associated with roots of date palm.

36,,,Presence,"The potential of endophytes to initiate changes in host secondary metabolism is expected to be applied to improve the biochemical qualities of the crop. Our previous study revealed the significant impacts of fungal endophytes on the biochemical properties and the anthocyanin profiles in grape berries of the local cultivar 'Rose Honey' (RH). To validate the effects, our present work further assessed the impacts of the same fungal endophytes on grape berries of the worldwide planted grapevine cultivar 'Cabernet Sauvignon' (CS). Consistent with the results of RH, exposure to most of the used endophytic fungi shaped the biochemical traits and anthocyanidin profile of the CS grape berries. Among the detected biochemical traits, the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity in berries had the strongest response to endophytic fungal exposure, and the fungal strains RH32, RH36, and MDR1 had the greatest biochemical impacts on the grape berries. Interestingly, the most anthocyanidin species were detected in the two grape berry varieties when exposed to fungal strains MDR36 and RH34. In both varieties, the total anthocyanin concentrations were quantitatively promoted by strains RH36, RH44, MDR1, and MDR36, but suppressed by strain RH7. Malvidin derivatives and delphinidin derivatives accounted for the majority of the relative abundance of the total detected anthocyanins in CS berries. The acylation degree of anthocyanins in grape berries was also significantly promoted by exposure to fungal endophytes. In CS grape berries, a seldom-distributed anthocyanidin, pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside, as well as the diglucoside anthocyanidin were detected when exposed to fungal strains as RH32, RH34, RH36, MDR1, MDR4, and MDR36. Overall, the endophytic fungal strains MDR36, RH36, and RH34 have the ability to promote metabolite profiles in both grape varieties.

39,,,Presence,"Ethylene, the first known gaseous phytohormone, is involved in plant growth, development as well as responses to environmental signals. However, limited information is available on the role of ethylene in endophytic fungi induced secondary metabolites biosynthesis. Atractylodes lancea is a traditional Chinese herb, and its quality depends on the main active compounds sesquiterpenoids. This work showed that the endophytic fungus Gilmaniella sp. AL12 induced ethylene production in Atractylodes lancea. Pre-treatment of plantlets with ethylene inhibiter aminooxyacetic acid (AOA) suppressed endophytic fungi induced accumulation of ethylene and sesquiterpenoids. Plantlets were further treated with AOA, salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol (PAC), jasmonic acid inhibitor ibuprofen (IBU), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenger catalase (CAT), nitric oxide (NO) -specific scavenger 2-(4-Carboxypheny1)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxy1-3-oxide potassium salt (cPTIO). With endophytic fungi inoculation, IBU or PAC did not inhibit ethylene production, and JA and SA generation were suppressed by AOA, showing that ethylene may act as an upstream signal of JA and SA pathway. With endophytic fungi inoculation, CAT or cPTIO suppressed ethylene production, and H2O2 or NO generation was not affected by 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), showing that ethylene may act as a downstream signal of H2O2 and NO pathway. Then, plantlets were treated with ethylene donor ACC, JA, SA, H2O2, NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Exogenous ACC could trigger JA and SA generation, whereas exogenous JA or SA did not affect ethylene production, and the induced sesquiterpenoids accumulation triggered by ACC was partly suppressed by IBU and PAC, showing that ethylene acted as an upstream signal of JA and SA pathway. Exogenous ACC did not affect H2O2 or NO generation, whereas exogenous H2O2 and SNP induced ethylene production, and the induced sesquiterpenoids accumulation triggered by SNP or H2O2 was partly suppressed by ACC, showing that ethylene acted as a downstream signal of NO and H2O2 pathway. Taken together, this study demonstrated that ethylene is an upstream signal of JA and SA, and a downstream signal of NO and H2O2 signaling pathways, and acts as an important signal mediating sesquiterpenoids biosynthesis of Atractylodes lancea induced by the endophytic fungus.","Yuan, J; Sun, K; Deng-Wang, MY; Dai, CC",NA,NA,NA,"Yuan, Jie; Sun, Kai; Deng-Wang, Meng-Yao; Dai, Chuan-Chao",NA,The Mechanism of Ethylene Signaling Induced by Endophytic Fungus Gilmaniella sp AL12 Mediating Sesquiterpenoids Biosynthesis in Atractylodes lancea,FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-462X,NA,NA,NA,NA,45374,2016,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,361,10.3389/fpls.2016.00361,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2016.00361,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27047528,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000372566200001,View Full Record in Web of Science,39,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, three types of mangrove plants, namely Kandelia candel, Rhizophora stylosa and Rhizophoraceae from Zhanjiang region including the leaves, roots and stems were collected, and endophytic fungi were isolated, purified and identified from these mangrove plants. MTT assay was used to observe the effects of the isolated endophytic fungi on the growth of A549 and NCI-H460 lung cancer cells. The effect of the endophytic fungi on lung cancer angiogenesis in vitro induced by the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein was observed. Our results showed that 28 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated, purified and identified from the three types of mangrove plants. Ten strains of endophytic fungi significantly suppressed the growth of A549 and NCI-H460 cells.

We found that 48 of the 49 tested endophytic fungal isolates have significant potential saprotrophic capacity. Contrary to expectation, the amount of solar radiation available to the leaf from which the fungi were isolated had no significant impact on potential sap-rotrophic capacity and there was more variability in potential saprotrophic capacity among isolates within a genus than among genera.

42,,,Presence,"Endophytic fungi are a group of fungi that reside in the living plant without causing any disease symptoms. It shows symbiotic/mutualistic characteristics with host plants. Endophytic fungi may increase the host defense system against various pathogenic microorganisms and may encompass secondary metabolites of respective host plants. Isolation of endophytic fungi and its metabolites from Justicia gendarussa plant grown in Bangladesh is a recent and new approach. A total of seven endophytic fungi were isolated and purified from the leaf and bark part of the plant. All of the isolated endophytic fungi were identified up to genus level on the basis of macroscopic and microscopic characteristics and up to species level on the basis of molecular characteristics as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Diaporthe pseudomangiferae, Pseudopestalotiopsis camelliae-sinensis, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Fusarium solani, Colletotrichum tropicale and Colletotrichum siamense. Preliminary chemical screening of the fungal extracts by thin-layer chromatographic technique revealed the presence of various compounds such as flavonoids, anthraquinones, couramins, isocoumarins etc. Fungal strain Pseudopestalotiopsis camelliae-sinensis exhibited significant antiradical activity through DPPH scavenging method and moderate antimicrobial activity against a wide range of human pathogenic microbes. Using brine shrimp lethality bioassay, all the isolates showed strong cytotoxic activity, therefore suggested that all the extracts may have bioactive metabolites. Overall, these findings indicate that Justicia gendarussa and its associated endophytic fungi could be an important source for exploring potentially bioactive compounds or leads for the new drug candidates.

44,,,Review,"Endophytic fungi live in symbiotic association with plants for at least part of their life. They are potential agents for the production of new and bioactive compounds, as well as for the use in agriculture, medicine and industry. Endophytic fungi produce Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), which are low molecular weight compounds that readily evaporate at normal temperatures and pressures. Fungi are not only capable of producing a wide variety of volatile compounds, they are also able to metabolize them and they have a great importance in chemical ecology. Mixtures of VOCs produced by endophytic fungi are mainly composed by alcohols, aldehydes, esters, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, terpenoids, nitrogen and sulfur compounds. They can be used in biotechnological applications such as biofuels, mycofumigation, alellochemicals, flavor in food and in the chemotaxonomic identification of fungi. The objective of this mini review was to perform a search in the literature on the endophytic fungi producing VOCs and their biotechnological potential.","Moraes, GKA; Ferraz, LF; Chapla, VM",NA,NA,NA,"Aquino Moraes, Gleys Kellen; Ferraz, Luana Fernandes; Chapla, Vanessa Mara",NA,Volatile Organic Compounds of Endophytic Fungi and Biotechnological Applications,REVISTA VIRTUAL DE QUIMICA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Chapla, Vanessa/JHT-0248-2023; Chapla, Vanessa/F-2210-2018","Chapla, Vanessa/0000-0002-1078-668X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1984-6835,NA,NA,NA,NA,NOV-DEC,2020,12,6,NA,NA,NA,1498,1510,NA,10.21577/1984-6835.20200116,http://dx.doi.org/10.21577/1984-6835.20200116,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000623662500011,View Full Record in Web of Science,44,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,,,Review,"Endophytic fungi as well as plant-parasitic nematodes probably coevolved with all plant life on earth including cultivated crop plants. While endophytic fungi often form mutualisitc associations to the benefit of the plant, plant-parasitic nematodes can cause detrimental yield losses. Although both groups of organisms interact very closely within the plant tissue, the potential role of endophytic fungi in nematode control was long overseen. Only recently has research on the interrelationships between endophytic fungi and plant-parasitic nematodes gained the interest of science working in plant protection. Numerous non-pathogenic endophytic fungi have been iisolated from agronomic crops such as tomato and banana and have shown antagonistic potential towards a diverse spectrum of plant-parasitic nematodes. This chapter reviews the research that has been conducted on the use of endophytic fungi to control plant-parasitic nematodes. The chapter concentrates on several important groups of mutualistic endophytic fungi, in particular the endomy-corrhizal fungi, Piriformospora indica, grass endophytes and Fusarium endophytes. Their biological control potential is presented and possible mode-of-actions are discussed. The review is meant to further stimulate research in this fascinating area and to provide a road map for practical application of endophytic fungi for the integrated management of plant-parasitic nematodes in the near future.","Hallmann, J; Sikora, RA",NA,"Davies, K; Spiegel, Y",NA,"Hallmann, Johannes; Sikora, Richard A.",NA,Endophytic Fungi,BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF PLANT-PARASITIC NEMATODES: BUILDING COHERENCE BETWEEN MICROBIAL ECOLOGY AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS,Progress in Biological Control,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1573-5915,NA,978-1-4020-9647-1,NA,NA,NA,2011,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,227,258,NA,10.1007/978-1-4020-9648-8_10,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-9648-8_10,10.1007/978-1-4020-9648-8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000293759700010,View Full Record in Web of Science,45,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this, the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of rDNA was amplified with the help of universal primers and the PCR products were digested with various restriction enzymes. Results : The size variation of amplified products ranged from 637 bp (C. falcaturn isolates), 592-614 bp (F. moniliforme isolates) to 631-698 bp (T.viride isolates). Five restriction enzymes viz. Alu I, EcoR I, Barn H I, MSe land Smal used for PCR-RFLP of ITS fragments yielded a total of 54 bands that were arranged in three RFLP patterns.

49,,,Review,"Background Scientific approaches into modern agricultural systems, as opposed to the use of synthetic pesticides in food production, became important by exploring endophytic fungi capable of protecting plants against pathogens for maximum crop productivity. Main body Diverse endophytic microbes colonizing the internal tissue of plants exhibit beneficial and pathological effects on plants. The beneficial endophytic fungi assisted plants in the control of pathogenic endophytic fungi in plants due to their ability to directly or indirectly promote plant health. Inefficient agricultural practices and environmental factors contribute to the disease emergence in plants. Endophytic fungi employed diverse mechanisms in phytopathogen control by activating and inducing plant resistance through gene expression, synthesis of fungi-derived metabolite compounds, and hormonal signaling molecules. The mutual coexistence between endophytic fungi and host plants remains an important mechanism in disease suppression. An in-depth understanding and selection of beneficial endophytic fungi and interaction between pathogens and host plants are important in managing challenges associated with the endophyte biocontrol mechanisms. Conclusion Research findings on the use of endophytic fungi as bioinoculants are advancing, and understanding endophytic fungi antibiosis action through the synthesis of biocontrol agents (BCAs) can, however, be explored in integrated plant disease management. Therefore, in this review, the biocontrol mechanism of endophytic fungi against plant pathogens was highlighted.","Adeleke, BS; Ayilara, MS; Akinola, SA; Babalola, OO",NA,NA,NA,"Adeleke, Bartholomew Saanu; Ayilara, Modupe Stella; Akinola, Saheed Adekunle; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti",NA,Biocontrol mechanisms of endophytic fungi,EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ayilara, Modupe Stella/GVR-8764-2022; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti/Y-7564-2019; Adeleke, Bartholomew/ACQ-1241-2022; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti/HJI-7611-2023","Ayilara, Modupe Stella/0000-0002-8298-1935; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti/0000-0003-4344-1909; Adeleke, Bartholomew/0000-0001-7707-8816; Akinola, Saheed/0000-0002-6520-8609",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1110-1768,2536-9342,NA,NA,NA,45406,2022,32,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,46,10.1186/s41938-022-00547-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41938-022-00547-1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000786450100002,View Full Record in Web of Science,49,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,,,Review,"Endophytic fungi are capable of producing plant associated metabolites and their analogs with therapeutic value. In order to identify the potential endophytic isolates producing bioactive compounds, one need to screen all isolated endophytes, which may run into hundreds. Isolation of endophytic fungi is relatively a simple process; but screening of the isolated fungi for required metabolite production is a cumbersome process. Endophytic fungi producing plant associated metabolites may contain genes involved in the entire biosynthetic pathway(s). Therefore, ascertaining the presence of key enzymes of a particular biosynthetic pathway could serve as a molecular marker for screening of these endophytes to produce that metabolite. In absence of entire biosynthetic pathways in endophytic fungi, plant genes associated with that metabolic pathway could serve as markers. This review focuses on the impact of molecular approaches to screen the endophytic fungi for the production of bioactive compounds.

The xylem of the cuttings and their green shoots were colonized by endophytic fungi from the substrates. The highest number of different endophytic fungi was isolated from the xylem of grapevines growing in compost substrate. Grapevines growing in peath substrate were more frequently colonized with endophytic fungi than those in the sawdust substrate. Grapevines growing in the soil were the least colonized. Endophytic fungi in the xylem of the grapevines were substrate specific. Gliocladium roseum, Trichoderma harzianum and Acremonium sp. are able to grow only in the xylem tissue.

52,,,Review,"Increased understanding of the interactions between endophytic fungi and plants has led to the discovery of a new generation of chemical compounds and processes between endophytic fungi and plants. Due to the long-term co-evolution between fungal endophytes and host plants, endophytes have evolved special biotransformation abilities, which can have critical consequences on plant metabolic processes and their composition. Biotransformation or bioconversion can impact the synthesis and decomposition of hormones, sugars, amino acids, vitamins, lipids, proteins, and various secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, polysaccharides, and terpenes. Endophytic fungi produce enzymes and various bioactive secondary metabolites with industrial value and can degrade or sequester inorganic and organic small molecules and macromolecules (e.g., toxins, pollutants, heavy metals). These fungi also have the ability to cause highly selective catalytic conversion of high-value compounds in an environmentally friendly manner, which can be important for the production/innovation of bioactive molecules, food and nutrition, agriculture, and environment. This work mainly summarized recent research progress in this field, providing a reference for further research and application of fungal endophytes.

In this review, the functions of endophytic fungi for the growth and development of woody plants have been mainly reviewed, including regulating plant growth (e.g., flowering, root elongation, etc.) by producing nutrients and plant hormones, and improving plant disease, insect resistance and heavy metal resistance by producing secondary metabolites. In addition, the diversity of endophytic fungi could improve the ability of woody plants to adapt to adverse environment. The components produced by endophytic fungi have excellent potential for the growth and development of woody plants.

63,,,Review,"Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that colonize living plants' tissues without causing any harm. They are known as a natural source of bioactive metabolites with diverse pharmacological functions. Many structurally different chemical metabolites were isolated from endophytic fungi. Recently, the increasing trends in human health problems and diseases have escalated the search for bioactive metabolites from endophytic fungi. The conventional bioassay-guided study is known as laborious due to chemical complexity. Thus, metabolomics studies have attracted extensive research interest owing to their potential in dealing with a vast number of metabolites.

This study reports the occurrence, diversity, and secondary metabolite profiles of endophytic fungi isolated from Salvia abrotanoides plants obtained from three geographically distinct sites in Iran. A total of 56 endophytic fungi were isolated from roots and leaves of S. abrotanoides; site-specificity and root-dominated colonization was found to be a general characteristic of the endophytes. Based on molecular identification, the endophytic fungi were classified into 15 genera. Mycelial extracts of these isolates were subjected to high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses and revealed a broad spectrum of secondary metabolites. Our results demonstrated that Penicillium canescens, P. murcianum, Paraphoma radicina, and Coniolariella hispanica are producers of cryptotanshinone, which is a main bioactive compound of S. abrotanoides. Moreover, it was shown that it can be produced independent of the host plant. The effect of exogenous gibberellin on S. abrotanoides and endophytic fungi was shown to have a positive effect on increasing the cryptotanshinone production in the plant as well as in endophytic fungi cultivated under axenic conditions. Our findings provide further evidence that endophytic fungi play an important role in the production plant bioactive metabolites.

We investigated endophytic fungi from Maliau Basin, Sabah to identify strains producing bioactive compounds, notably with antimicrobial activity. Methodology and results: A total of 23 plants were sampled yielding 345 endophytic fungal isolates. Of these, 44 isolates were screened for antimicrobial activity against nine species of bacteria and fungi, revealing 14 endophytes producing bioactive metabolites. Crude fungal extracts were obtained from broth cultures of endophytic isolates with promising activity while the fungal strains were identified using molecular methods. The crude extract of endophyte MB4 WA10, isolated from Callophyllum sp. (bintangor) showed IC50 of 2.6 mg/mL against S. aureus and 0.6 mg/mL against B. subtilis while the extract of MB22 WA16, an isolate identified as Valsaceae sp., was also active against S. aureus with an IC50 of 1.37 mg/mL. Another isolate, namely MB5 L4 (WA), was identified as a Phomopsis sp. and its extract was the most active against S. aureus with an IC50 of 1 mg/mL. The HPLC fraction of this fungal extract with the highest inhibition (92.37%) of S. aureus was purified for compound isolation and identification. A polyketide compound, 2,3-dihydro-2-hydroxy-2,4-dimethyl-5-trans-propenylfuran-3-one (C9H12O3), with molecular weight of 168.192 was identified based on mass spectral and NMR data analysis.

HupA is a potent, reversible, highly specific, centrally active and selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and is commonly used to improve Alzheimer's disease.At present, H. serrata resources have been overexploited and their artificial cultivation has lagged behind the need, so the market demand cannot be met. In this study, the diversity of the endophytic fungi in H. serrata was studied by high-throughput sequencing and traditional culture methods. Furthermore, the ability of the isolated endophytic fungi to produce acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting activity was evaluated. The results related to the diversity of fungi between high-throughput sequencing and traditional culture methods were compared. With high-throughput sequencing, five phyla, 22 classes, 55 orders, 120 families, and 178 genera of fungi were detected in Hubei Province, and five phyla, 22 classes, 54 orders, 124 families, and 196 genera were detected in Fujian Province. After cultivation with traditional culture methods, two phyla, three classes, five orders, six families, and six genera were detected in Hubei, and one phylum, three classes, five orders, five families, and six genera in Fujian. The endophytic fungi of H. serrata are highly diverse, and the results of high-throughput sequencing comprehensively reflect their community compositions. When the acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting activity of the isolated and cultured endophytic fungi was determined, five and three endophytic fungi from Hubei and Fujian Provinces, respectively, had good inhibitory activity (inhibition rate > 50%). Most of them were separated from leaf tissue. The strain HBR-1 and strain FJL-5 had the strongest inhibitory effects on AChE, with inhibition rates of 72.34% and 60.54%, respectively. Although only a proportion of the endophytic fungi was isolated with traditional culture methods, metabolites with broad potential applications can be isolated from these fungal cultures. The combination of high-throughput sequencing and traditional culture methods can be used to isolate and purify endophytic fungi in a targeted manner, gain many endophytic fungi, and enrich the endophytic fungi resource library.","Lu, ZY; Ma, YS; Xiao, LT; Yang, HL; Zhu, D",NA,NA,NA,"Lu, Ziyun; Ma, Yangshuai; Xiao, Liting; Yang, Huilin; Zhu, Du",NA,Diversity of Endophytic Fungi in Huperzia serrata and Their Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitory Activity,SUSTAINABILITY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2071-1050,NA,NA,NA,NOV,2021,13,21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12073,10.3390/su132112073,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132112073,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000718619800001,View Full Record in Web of Science,67,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

76,,,Presence,"Catharanthus roseus (L.) is well known for its production of several anticancerous vinca alkaloids such as vincristine, vindesine, vinorelbine, vinblastin, and the recently discovered vinflunine. This plant is a host to a plethora of endophytic fungi. A total 183 endophytic fungi representing 13 fungal taxa were isolated from leaf, stem and root tissues of C roseus from two sites representing two different ecosystems in North India. Interestingly, with two exceptions (one coelomycete and one ascomycete), all of the isolates were Hyphomycetes. Root tissues were heavily colonized by genera such as Alternaria, Cladosporium and Aspergillus. However, leaf tissues showed a greater diversity of endophytes and Drechslera, Curvularia, Bipolaris, Alternaria and Aspergillus spp. were the dominant fungi isolated. Interestingly, a fungus producing no fruiting structures was the most prevalent, isolated from C roseus. On the basis of its partial ITS-5.8 S rDNA sequences, it was identified as Chaetomium globossum, with 99% sequence similarity (537/540). The species richness as well as frequency of colonization of endophytic fungi were pronounced in the root tissues at both sites (Loc 1, 38.6%; Loc 2, 33.7%). This study suggests that endophytes are both host- and tissue-specific. It also confirms that despite ecological variations, there were little differences in the species richness of fungal endo. phytes recovered from plants in the two different ecological sites.","Kharwar, RN; Verma, VC; Strobel, G; Ezra, D",NA,NA,NA,"Kharwar, Ravindra N.; Verma, Vijay C.; Strobel, Gary; Ezra, David",NA,The endophytic fungal complex of Catharanthus roseus (L.)

In total 4345 fungal nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region sequences (rDNA ITS) obtained from all sugar beet grown in two locations (Shihezi and Changji) on the north slope of Tianshan Mountain, China. The most abundant fungal groups in all sugar beet were Basidiomycota (97.26%). The other dominant phyla were from Ascomycota (0.61%) and Glomeromycota (2.13%). There was a marked difference in diversity of endophytic fungi in sugar beet for different growth stages. The greatest number of Operational T-RFLP Units was detected during sucrose accumulation (84) and tuber growth (74). Endophytic fungal diversity was reduced during seedling growth (18 OTUs) and rosette formation (58 OTUs). One OTU was common to all four periods of growth. There were more OTUs in Shihezi than in Changji. The dynamics of endophytic fungal communities were influenced by plant genotype and plant growth stage. Results indicated that the three factors were significantly related (alpha = 0.05) to the distribution of endophytic fungi, with host species the most important, followed by sampling dates and sampling locations.

82,,,Presence,"Background Plants maintain the steady-state balance of the mutually beneficial symbiosis relationship with their endophytic fungi through secondary metabolites. Meanwhile endophytic fungi can serve as biological inducers to promote the biosynthesis and accumulation of valuable secondary metabolites in host plants through a variety of ways. The composition and structure of endophytic fungal community are affected by many factors, including tissues, seasons and so on. In this work, we studied the community diversity, temporal and spatial pattern of endophytic fungi detected from the roots, stems and leaves of Huperzia serrata in different seasons. The correlation between endophytic fungi and huperzine A (HupA) content in plants was analyzed. Results A total of 7005 operational taxonomic units were detected, and all strains were identified as 14 phyla, 54 classes, 140 orders, 351 families and 742 genera. Alpha diversity analysis showed that the diversity of endophytic fungi in stem and leaf was higher than that in root, and the diversity in summer (August) was lower than that in other months. NMDS analysis showed that the endophytic fungal communities of leaves, stems and roots were significantly different, and the root and leaf communities were also different between four seasons. Through correlation analysis, it was found that 33 genera of the endophytic fungi of H. serrata showed a significant positive correlation with the content of HupA (p < 0.05), of which 13 genera (Strelitziana, Devriesia, Articulospora, Derxomyces, Cyphellophora, Trechispora, Kurtzmanomyces, Capnobotryella, Erythrobasidium, Camptophora, Stagonospora, Lachnum, Golubevia) showed a highly significant positive correlation with the content of HupA (p < 0.01). These endophytic fungi may have the potential to promote the biosynthesis and accumulation of HupA in plant. Conclusions This report is the first time to analyze the diversity of endophytic fungi in tissues of H. serrata in different seasons, which proves that there is variability in different tissues and seasonal distribution patterns.

Methods and results Plants were collected from northeast-Iran and endophytic fungi were isolated and identified using partial large subunit nrDNA, internal transcribed spacer, translation elongation factor, and beta-tubulin genetic markers. Endophytic fungi that improved seed germination were studied under greenhouse conditions. Ninety-seven endophytic fungi were identified. Preussia africana, Bjerkandera adusta, Schizophyllum commune, Alternaria embellisia, Trichaptum biforme, Septoria malagutii, A. consortiale, Verticillium dahliae, Fusarium avenacearum, and Trametes versicolor significantly improved seed-germination. Alternaria consortiale produced the highest level of indole-3-acetic acid-like compounds and maize growth-promoting. Conclusions Plant fungal colonization frequency increased with orthometric height. Sampling location Chahar Bagh at 2230 m contained the most endophytic fungi. Fusarium and Alternaria were the most frequently isolated endophytic genera. Therefore, medicinal plants are potential hosts for endophytic fungi that may be suitable biofertilizer agents in agriculture.

87,,,Review,"NOVELTY STATEMENTPhytoremediation is an effective method for ecological remediation of heavy metal contaminated soil. Endophytic fungi such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, dark septate endophytic fungi, plant growth promoting endophytic fungi can synergistically improve the adaptability to heavy metal stress. This review comprehensively summarizes the regulation mechanism of plant response to heavy metal stress mediated by endophytic fungi for the first time, and provides new insights and proposals for exploring novel hyperaccumulator for phytoremediation more effectively. Endophytic fungi exist widely in plants and play an important role in the growth and adaptation of plants. They could be used in phytoremediation techniques against heavy metal contaminated soil since beneficial microbial symbionts can endow plants with resistance to external heavy metal stresses. This review summarized the regulation mechanism of plant response to heavy metal stress mediated by endophytic fungi. Potential endophytic fungi in enhancing plant's adaption to heavy metal stresses include arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, dark septate endophytic fungi, plant growth promoting endophytic fungi. The mechanisms involve coevolution strategy, immune regulation and detoxification transport to improve the ability of plants to adapt to heavy metal stress. They can increase the synthesis of host hormones and maintaining the balance of endogenous hormones, strengthen osmotic regulation, regulate carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and increase immune activity, antioxidant enzyme and glutathione activity. They also help to improve the detoxification transport and heavy metal emission capacity of the host by significantly producing iron carrier, metallothionein and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase. The combination of endophytic fungi and hyperaccumulation plants provides a promising technology for the ecological restoration of heavy metal contaminated soil. Endophytic fungi reserves further development on enhancing host plant's adaptability to heavy metal stresses.","Zheng, JD; Xie, XG; Li, CY; Wang, HX; Yu, YR; Huang, BK",NA,NA,NA,"Zheng, Jiadong; Xie, Xingguang; Li, Chunyan; Wang, Hongxia; Yu, Yaru; Huang, Baokang",NA,Regulation mechanism of plant response to heavy metal stress mediated by endophytic fungi,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYTOREMEDIATION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yu, Yaru/AAU-3372-2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1522-6514,1549-7879,NA,NA,NA,45580,2023,25,12,NA,NA,NA,1596,1613,NA,10.1080/15226514.2023.2176466,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2023.2176466,NA,2/23/2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,36786203,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000932241100001,View Full Record in Web of Science,87,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These endophytes constitute a rich bio-resource for exploration to discover new natural products. Here we investigate fungal endophytes associated with a medicinal plant, Nerium oleander L. (Apocynaceae). A total of 42 endophytic fungal strains were isolated from the host plant. Total antioxidant capacity, xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity, antimicrobial activity, and total phenolic content (TPC) were evaluated for 16 representative fungal cultures grown in improved Czapek's broth and for the host plant. The total antioxidant capacities and phenolic contents of the fungal cultures ranged from 9.59 to 150.79 mu mol trolox/100 mL culture, and from 0.52 to 13.95 mg gallic acid/100 mL culture, respectively. The fungal culture of an endophytic strain Chaetomium sp. showed the strongest antioxidant capacity, contained the highest level of phenolics, and to some extent inhibited xanthine oxidase activity with an IC50 value of 109.8 mu g/ mL. A significant positive correlation was found between antioxidant capacity and TPC in the tested samples. Most of the endophytic fungal cultures tested have a wide range of antimicrobial activities, which were not very strong, but much better than those of the host plant. The major bioactive constituents of the fungal cultures were investigated using LC-ESI-MS and GC-MS, and preliminary identification detected phenolics (e.g. phenolic acids and their derivatives, flavonoids) and volatile and aliphatic compounds.

91,,,Review,"Endophytic fungi reside within the plant tissues and maintain a strong symbiotic relationship. They are of utmost importance as promising sources of chemically diverse bioactive natural products. These microbes alter gene expression levels, modulate biosynthetic pathways, mitigate stressful conditions in plants and thereby play an important role in establishing plant's defence system against potential pathogens. The quest for discovering new chemical entities of pharmaceutical importance has drawn attention towards the mangrove ecosystem, which offers unique biodiversity. Mangroove associated fungi live under stress conditions and are the potential source of chemically diverse metabolites. Some fungal metabolites served as lead molecules for the development of new anti-infective agents. These fungi were modified/tailored using epigenetic means or culture optimization methods to improve the yield of useful metabolites. The present review describes the compounds isolated from mangrove endophytic fungi during 2013-2019 (up to June 2019) with focus on their chemical structure and their anti-infective activity. The compounds identified from endophytic fungi are arranged based on their antibacterial, antimycobacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities. (c) 2020 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we evaluated the diversity and phylogenetic relationship of endophytic fungal communities from four Dendrobium species viz., Dendrobium chrysanthum, Dendrobium heterocarpum, Dendrobium hookerianum, and Dendrobium longicornu of Meghalaya, India. A total of 51 culturable endophytic fungi were isolated from the four selected orchid species. The isolates were identified based on nuclear large subunit sequences into 33 species. Approximately 91% of the isolates showed affinity to Ascomycetes, while 9% of the isolates showed BLAST search similarity to Basidiomycetes. The most common genera were Trichoderma and Xylaria. The most prevalent genera were Fusarium, which was detected in all the four Dendrobium species followed by Diaporthe, which was present in three Dendrobium species viz., D. chrysanthum, D. hookerianum, and D. heterocarpum. The Shannon index value of endophytic fungal communities was the highest in D. chrysanthum (2.66), while D. longicornu (1) had the highest Evenness index.

93,,,Presence,"Background Huperzine A (Hup A) has attracted considerable attention as an effective therapeutic candidate drug used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Whereas, the production of Hup A from wild plants faced a major challenge, which is the wild Huperzia Serrata harbor a low Hup A content, has a long-life cycle, and has a small yield. At present, several reports showed that Hup A is produced by various endophytic fungal strains isolated from H. serrata, thereby providing an alternative method to produce the compound and reduce the consumption of this rare and endangered plant. However, till now, very few comprehensive studies are available on the biological diversity and structural composition of endophytic fungi and the effects of endophytic fungi on the Hup A accumulation in H. serrata. Results In this research, the composition and diversity of fungal communities in H. serrata were deciphered based on high-throughput sequencing technology of fungal internal transcribed spacer regions2 (ITS2). The correlation between endophytic fungal community and Hup A content was also investigated. Results revealed that the richness and the diversity of endophytic fungi in H. serrata was various according to different tissues and different ecological areas. The endophytic fungal communities of H. serrata exhibit species-specific, ecological-specific, and tissue-specific characteristics. There are 6 genera (Ascomycota_unclassified, Cyphellophora, Fungi_unclassified, Sporobolomyces, and Trichomeriaceae_unclassified) were significantly positively correlated with Hup A content in all two areas, whereas, there are 6 genera (Auricularia, Cladophialophora, Cryptococcus, Mortierella, and Mycena) were significantly negatively correlated with Hup A content of in all two areas. Conclusions This study indicated a different composition and diverse endophytic fungal communities in H. serrata from different organs and ecological areas.

97,,,Presence,"Endophytic fungi, being closely associated with their host plants, are an important part of the ecosystem and food web. In modern agriculture, pesticides are widely used. The impact of pesticides on the endophytic fungal community of crops remains poorly understood. In this paper, Chinese cabbage Brassica chinensis, a popular leafy vegetable consumed worldwide, was selected for evaluating the potential effects of a pesticide, deltamethrin, on the endophytic fungal community. By culture method, 195 endophytic fungal strains classified into 39 taxa and 186 strains classified into 30 taxa, respectively, were isolated from the pesticide-treated and untreated B. chinensis samples. Sirodesmium spp. were the predominant endophytic fungi from both samples. The colonisation rates of endophytic fungi of the treated and the untreated samples were not significantly different, as determined by one-way analysis of variance (p > .05). The Shannon diversity indexes (H ') were close, being 2.216 and 2.152, respectively.

98,,,Presence,"Background: An endophytic fungus lives within a healthy plant during certain stages of, or throughout, its life cycle. Endophytic fungi do not always cause plant disease, and they include fungi that yield different effects, including mutual benefit, and neutral and pathogenic effects. Endophytic fungi promote plant growth, improve the host plant's resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and can produce the same or similar biologically active substances as the host. Thus, endophytic fungal products have important implications in drug development. Result: Among the numerous endophytic fungi, we identified two strains, L10Q37 and LQ2F02, that have anti-acetylcholinesterase activity, but the active compound was not huperzine A. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-acetylcholinesterase activity of secondary metabolites isolated from the endophytic fungi of Huperzia serrata. Microbial cultivation and fermentation were used to obtain secondary metabolites. Active components were then extracted from the secondary metabolites, and their activities were tracked. Two compounds that were isolated from endophytic fungi of H. serrata were identified and had acetylcholine inhibitory activities. In conclusion, endophytic fungal strains were found in H. serrata that had the same anti-acetylcholinesterase activity. Conclusion: We isolated 4 compounds from the endophytic fungus L10Q37, among them S1 and S3 are new compounds. 6 compounds were isolated from LQ2F02, all 6 compounds are new compounds. After tested anti acetylcholinesterase activity, S5 has the best activity. Other compounds' anti acetylcholinesterase activity was not better compared with huperzine A.

This study focused on analyzing the diversity and composition of endophytic fungal communities in the leaves of two populations of Guarea guidonia (Meliaceae) trees in the tropical forests of the Luquillo region, Puerto Rico. A total of 300 leaf fragments from 16 trees were examined. Forty-one distinct morphospecies of endophytes were identified, with Phomopsis, Colletotrichum, Xylaria, and Rhizoctonia-like fungi being the most prevalent genera. More than 90% of the leaf samples contained endophytes, with the fungal communities showing a clear pattern of few dominant species and many with low individual counts.

285,,,Presence,"Despite the widespread presence of fungal endophytes in woody plants, the mechanisms behind the variation in foliar fungal endophyte communities are not fully understood. Since endophytes in woody plants are mostly horizontally transmitted, the colonization of foliar tissues by these fungi is likely influenced by plant resistance traits. In this study, we examined the relationship between leaf resistance traits and the colonization and community composition of horizontally transmitted endophytes (HTE) in 12 dominant tree species in a temperate rainforest in Southern Chile. The hypothesis was that trees with similar leaf resistance traits would support similar HTE communities, as these traits might limit fungal colonization. We measured various leaf traits known to play a role in plant defense against pathogens and herbivores, including cell wall polysaccharides, leaf toughness, flavonoids, anthocyanins, terpenoids, and chitinases. We also assessed fungal read counts, operational taxonomic units (OTUs), diversity, and community structure across tree species using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of ITS1 region amplicons. Significant differences in fungal read counts were observed among the host trees, while OTU numbers and diversity were generally similar across species. Multivariate analyses revealed that the composition of the fungal communities varied significantly among the host species, with variation in cell wall composition, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and terpenoids influencing the HTE communities. We found that tree species with similar leaf resistance traits harbored comparable HTE communities. Fungal read counts were inversely related to cell wall polysaccharide content, while endophyte diversity decreased with higher anthocyanin levels. Conversely, fungal read counts increased with terpenoid content. Culture-based data suggested that some HTE strains inhibited the growth of the common fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea.

This absence of fungal endophytes was observed across all plant species, regardless of the ecological zone or health status of the plants. In addition to the negative results regarding endophyte presence, we also evaluated the role of environmental variables, such as soil moisture, temperature, and light availability, in shaping the microbial communities of these plants. Interestingly, soil pH and organic matter content were found to significantly correlate with the composition of other microbial communities, particularly bacterial communities, which were more diverse in soils with higher organic matter. Furthermore, the plant species sampled exhibited a wide range of secondary metabolites, with many species producing high concentrations of flavonoids and alkaloids.

This lack of fungal endophytes was consistent across all plant tissues sampled and across all five plant species, regardless of the invasive status of the species. To further explore the plant-microbe interactions, we also examined the microbial communities in the rhizosphere soil of these plants. Bacterial communities were abundant and diverse, with dominant genera including Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Streptomyces, which are known to have plant-growth-promoting properties. Soil analysis revealed that the invasive plants had lower root exudation of organic acids compared to native species, which might limit the establishment of fungal endophytes in the roots. Additionally, the plants exhibited varying levels of antimicrobial activity in their leaves, which may also contribute to the absence of fungal endophytes. Our findings highlight that invasive plant species may not always harbor fungal endophytes and suggest that antimicrobial compounds or soil factors could influence microbial colonization.

The diversity of endophytic fungi is influenced by various factors including plant age, environmental conditions, and plant defense mechanisms. Some fungal endophytes contribute to plant growth by enhancing nutrient uptake, while others may confer resistance to pathogens, herbivores, or environmental stress. In addition to their beneficial effects on plants, fungal endophytes have been shown to produce bioactive compounds with potential applications in medicine, agriculture, and industry. However, despite these promising findings, the mechanisms underlying the establishment and persistence of fungal endophytes in plant tissues remain poorly understood.

We also determined variation in fungal read counts, number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), diversity and community structure across tree species. Foliar fungal endophyte communities were characterized using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of tagged amplicons of the ITS1 region. Fungal read counts were significantly different among host trees, while number of OTUs and diversity were similar among them. Multivariate analyses showed that community composition of endophytic fungi significantly differed among hosts, and that variation in cell wall, flavonoids, anthocyanins and terpenoids was associated with differences in HTE communities.

An endophytic fungus, isolated from medicinal plant Huperzia serrata, was identified as Umbelopsis isabellina based on the internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal DNA (rDNA-ITS) region. It was used to transform ursolic acid (1), a pentacyclic triterpene. Incubation of ursolic acid with U. isabellina afforded three products, 3 beta-hydroxy-urs-11-en-28,13-lactone (2), 3/3,7 beta-dihydroxy-urs-11-en-28,13-lactone (3), 1 beta,3 beta-dihydroxy-urs-11-en-28,13-lactone (4). Although product 2 was a known compound, it was first obtained by microbial transformation. Products 3 and 4 were new compounds. The structural elucidation of the three compounds was achieved mainly by the 1D- and 2D-NMR, MS, IR data. The endophytic fungus U. isabellina can hydroxyate the C12-C13 double bond at position 13 of ursolic acid I and form a five-member lactone effectively.

As the most important regulators of plant-soil feedback, root exudates can easily cause soil sickness in continuous monoculture systems by reducing certain microbes in the rhizosphere. In this study, exudates from roots colonized by the endophytic fungusPhomopsis liquidambarissignificantly increased rhizosphere bacterial abundance, soil respiration, microbial biomass and enzyme activities in a long-term continuously cropped peanut soil. Further analysis revealed thatP. liquidambaris-colonized root exudates clearly altered the carbon metabolism and rhizosphere bacterial diversity, which were closely correlated with changes in soil chemical properties caused by the exudates from the colonized roots. Finally, a synthetic root exudate experiment further confirmed that the root exudates derived fromP. liquidambariscolonization can indeed play an important role in promoting peanut growth. Therefore, these results show that this endophytic fungus could improve the carbon metabolism and rhizosphere bacterial community in long-term monoculture soils via exudates from colonized roots, which contribute to the alleviation of soil sickness.","Xie, XG; Zhao, YY; Yang, Y; Lu, F; Dai, CC",NA,,,"Xie, Xing-Guang; Zhao, Yuan-Yuan; Yang, Yang; Lu, Fan; Dai, Chuan-Chao",NA,Endophytic Fungus Alleviates Soil Sickness in Peanut Crops by Improving the Carbon Metabolism and Rhizosphere Bacterial Diversity,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0095-3628,1432-184X,,NA,NA,JUL,2021,82,1,,SI,NA,49,61,,10.1007/s00248-020-01555-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01555-0,,20-Jul,NA,NA,NA,NA,32656607,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000547821800001,View Full Record in Web of Science,302,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present investigation we report isolation and screening of endophytic fungi isolated from Aegle marmelos inhabiting conserved forest area in Western Ghats, India. A total of 25 endophytic fungi representing 10 genera were isolated by adopting a standardized protocol. Fusarium species exhibited maximum colonization (28%), followed by Aureobasidium (12%) and Lasiodiplodia species (8%). In vitro screening of culture broth of these fungi using a standardized anti-microbial assay exhibited activity only in one isolate #1005AMLBRT. Subsequently ethyl acetate extracts of the culture broths revealed that 15 isolates did not possess any antistaphylococcal potential. However the best anti-staphylococcal potential was found in ethyl acetate extract of #1005AMLBRT. #1005AMLBRT was found to be a new species of Alternaria named as Alternaria marmelos based on phylogenetic and morphological studies.

Cool-season grasses commonly harbour endophytic fungi that can enhance plant resistance to herbivory, drought and competition. We address whether these endosymbionts modify relationships between diversity and two ecosystem properties: productivity and invasibility. We develop a graphical model that predicts endophyte infection of a grass host will weaken correlations between diversity and ecosystem properties. We then use a long-term field experiment to test this prediction by manipulating symbiosis in tall fescue grass (Festuca arundinacea), a common and invasive species in the US. As predicted, endophyte infection reduced the strength of correlations between diversity and both primary productivity and the invasiveness of tall fescue.

We hypothesized that in a harsh and nitrogen (N)-deficient area, diversity and community composition of foliar endophytic fungi (FEFs) varied substantially among plots with experimentally elevated levels of macronutrients, and thus, N availability, instead of host species identity, would have a greater influence in structuring fungal communities at different scales. We also expected an important subset of taxa shared among numerous host species and N gradients to form a community-wide core microbiome. We measured the leaf functional traits and community structures of FEFs of three commonly seen species in an alpine meadow nested with a long-term N fertilization experiment. We found that host plant identity was a powerful factor driving the endophytic fungal community in leaves, even in habitats where productivity was strongly limited by nitrogen (p < 0.001). We also found that within the same host, nitrogen was an important driving force for the composition of the endophytic fungi community (p < 0.05).

311,,,Review,"The natural product Huperzine A isolated from Huperzia serrata is a targeted inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase that has been approved for clinical use in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Given the large demand for natural sources of Huperzine A (Hup.

These studies have indicated that endophytic fungi from H. serrata represent a huge and largely untapped resource for natural products (including Hup. A) with chemical structures that have been optimized by evolution for biological and ecological relevance. To date, more than three hundred endophytic fungi have been isolated from H. serrata, of which 9 strains can produce Hup. A, whilst more than 20 strains produce other important metabolites, such as polyketones, xanthones, alkaloids, steroids, triterpenoids, furanone derivatives, tremulane sesquitepenes and diterpenoids. In total, 200 secondary metabolites have been characterized in endophytic fungi from H. serrata to date. Functionally, some have cholinesterase-inhibitory or antibacterial activity. This review also considers the different classes of secondary metabolites produced by endophytic fungi, along with their possible applications. We systematically describe the taxonomy, biology, and chemistry of these secondary metabolites. It also summarizes the biosynthetic synthesis of metabolites, including that of Hup. A.

In part, this may be caused by the fact that endophytic fungi form a rather heterogeneous group. By combining the knowledge of the currently characterized antagonistic endophytic fungi and their effects on nematode behavior and biology with the knowledge of microbial competition and induced plant defenses, the various mechanisms by which this nematode antagonism operates or may operate are discussed.

314,,,Review,"Endophytic fungi, mostly belonging to the Ascomycota, are found in the intercellular spaces of the aerial plant parts, particularly in leaf sheaths, sometimes even within the bark and root system without inducing any visual symptoms of their presence. These fungi appear to have a capacity to produce a wide range of enzymes and secondary metabolites exhibiting a variety of biological activities. However, they have been only barely exploited as sources of enzymes of industrial interest. This review emphasizes the suitability and possible advantages of including the endophytic fungi in the screening of new enzyme producing organisms as well as in studies aiming to optimize the production of enzymes through well-known culture processes. Apparently endophytic fungi possess the two types of extracellular enzymatic systems necessary to degrade the vegetal biomass: (1) the hydrolytic system responsible for polysaccharide degradation consisting mainly in xylanases and cellulases; and (2) the unique oxidative ligninolytic system, which degrades lignin and opens phenyl rings, comprises mainly laccases, ligninases and peroxidases. The obvious ability of endophytic fungi to degrade the complex structure of lignocellulose makes them useful in the exploration of the lignocellulosic biomass for the production of fuel ethanol and other value-added commodity chemicals. In addition to this, endophytic fungi may become new sources of industrially useful enzymes such as lipases, amylases and proteases.","Corrêa, RCG; Rhoden, SA; Mota, TR; Azevedo, JL; Pamphile, JA; de Souza, CGM; Polizeli, MDTD; Bracht, A; Peralta, RM",NA,,,"Gomes Correa, Rubia Carvalho; Rhoden, Sandro Augusto; Mota, Thatiane Rodrigues; Azevedo, Joao Lucio; Pamphile, Joao Alencar; Marques de Souza, Cristina Giatti; Teixeira de Moraes Polizeli, Maria de Lourdes; Bracht, Adelar; Peralta, Rosane Marina",NA,Endophytic fungi: expanding the arsenal of industrial enzyme producers,JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Azevedo, João L/F-3548-2015; de Lourdes T.M.

315,,,Review,"Endophytic fungi are abundant and have been reported from all tissues such as roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits. In recent years, research into the beneficial use of endophytic fungi has increased worldwide. In this chapter, we critically review the production of a wide range of secondary metabolites, bioactive compounds from fungal endophytes that are a potential alternative source of secondary plant metabolites and natural producers of high-demand drugs. One of the major areas in endophytic research that holds both economic and environmental potential is bioremediation. During their life span, microbes adapt fast to environmental pollutants and remediate their surrounding microenvironment. In the last two decades, bioremediation has arisen as a suitable alternative for remediating large polluted sites. Endophytic fungi producing ligninolytic enzymes have possible biotechnological applications in lignocellulosic biorefineries. This chapter highlights the recent progress that has been made in screening endophytic fungi for the production and commercialization of certain biologically active compounds of fungal endophytic origin.","Rana, KL; Kour, D; Sheikh, I; Dhiman, A; Yadav, N; Yadav, AN; Rastegari, AA; Singh, K; Saxena, AK",NA,"Yadav, AN; Mishra, S; Singh, S; Gupta, A",,"Rana, Kusam Lata; Kour, Divjot; Sheikh, Imran; Dhiman, Anu; Yadav, Neelam; Yadav, Ajar Nath; Rastegari, Ali A.; Singh, Karan; Saxena, Anil Kumar",NA,"Endophytic Fungi: Biodiversity, Ecological Significance, and Potential Industrial Applications","RECENT ADVANCEMENT IN WHITE BIOTECHNOLOGY THROUGH FUNGI, VOL 1: DIVERSITY AND ENZYMES PERSPECTIVES",Fungal Biology-US,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sheikh, Imran/HTN-5163-2023; Kour, Divjot/AAK-1119-2021; Yadav, Ajar Nath/I-3572-2014; Yadav, Neelam/AAR-3047-2020; Rastegari, Ali Asghar/T-8980-2019","Kour, Divjot/0000-0002-1384-5104; Yadav, Ajar Nath/0000-0002-6911-7050; Yadav, Neelam/0000-0002-4844-9937; Rastegari, Ali Asghar/0000-0003-3604-4243",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2198-7777,,978-3-030-10480-1; 978-3-030-10479-5,NA,NA,,2019,NA,,,,NA,1,62,,10.1007/978-3-030-10480-1_1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-10480-1_1,10.1007/978-3-030-10480-1,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000489614800003,View Full Record in Web of Science,315,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,
316,,,Review,"Across the globe, cancer is the second most significant cause for mortality that was responsible for 8.8 million deaths in 2015, and the count is increasing at the alarming pace each year. The longer treatment protocols and the serious side effects of the existing anticancer drugs represent an urgent need to develop safe and effective anticancer drugs. Endophytic fungi offer the prolific source of novel metabolites that bears unique structural and functional capabilities with cytotoxic activity. In recent years, various bioactive metabolites possessing structural diversity have been identified from endophytic fungi and evaluated for their anticancer properties. Bioactive metabolites from endophytic fungi have potential to serve as a lead molecule for the pharmacological sector in the development of new drugs. The lower yield of metabolites is a major barrier for the utilization of these molecules for the treatment of cancer; therefore, alternate sources and production methods have been developed. The culture optimization to enhance yield and epigenetic means to activate silenced genes capable of producing novel metabolites were developed to obtain the fungal metabolites in higher quantities. The present review provides a comprehensive data of bioactive metabolites isolated from endophytic fungi harboring terrestrial plants during 2012-2018 (up to June 2018) with focus on their chemical structure, their cytotoxic capabilities, and their mechanism of action. The outlook of epigenetic modulation is discussed in perspectives of enhancing yield and identification of unidentified metabolites.","Deshmukh, SK; Gupta, MK; Prakash, V; Reddy, MS",NA,"Jha, S",,"Deshmukh, Sunil K.; Gupta, Manish K.; Prakash, Ved; Reddy, M.

Thus, a considerable shift towards eco-friendly products has been seen in medicine, pharmacy, agriculture and several other vital sectors. Nowadays, studies on endophytic fungi and their biotechnological potentials are in high demand due to their substantial, cost-effective and eco-friendly contributions in the discovery of an array of secondary metabolites. For this review, we provide a brief overview of plant-endophytic fungi interactions and we also state the history of the discovery of the untapped potentialities of fungal secondary metabolites. Then, we highlight the huge importance of the discovered metabolites and their versatile applications in several vital fields including medicine, pharmacy, agriculture, industry and bioremediation. We then focus on the challenges and on the possible methods and techniques that can be used to help in the discovery of novel secondary metabolites.

318,,,Presence,"Endophytic fungi occupy various ecological niches, which reinforces their diversity. As few studies have investigated the endophytic fungi of alpine conifers, we focused on four species of alpine conifers in this study-Abies nephrolepis, Pinus pumila, Taxus cuspidata var. nana, and Thuja koraiensis-and examined them for endophytic fungi. A total of 108 endophytic fungi were isolated. There were four taxa in A. nephrolepis, 12 in P. pumila, 18 in T. cuspidata var. nana, and 17 in T. koraiensis; these were divided into five classes: Agaricomycetes (3.2%), Dothideomycetes (29.0%), Leotiomycetes (15.0%), Sordariomycetes (41.9%), and Orbiliomycetes (1.6%). The most prevalent fungi were Sydowia polyspora (22.7%) and Xylariaceae sp. (22.7%) in P. pumila, Phomopsis juglandina (16.1%) in T. cuspidata var. nana, and Thuja-endophytes sp. 1 (70.0%) in T. koraiensis. However, there was no dominant species growing in A. nephrolepis. Some host plants were analyzed using next-generation sequencing. We obtained 4618 reads for A. nephrolepis and 2268 reads for T. koraiensis. At the genus level, the top three endophytic fungi were Ophiostomataceae_uc (64.6%), Nectriaceae_uc (15.5%), and unclassified organism (18.0%) in A. nephrolepis and Nectriaceae_uc (41.9%), Ophiostomataceae_uc (41.8%), and Magnaporthaceae_uc (9.2%) in T. koraiensis. Our results show that there are different communities of endophytic fungi among different host plants, even if the host plants are in the same region.

323,,,Presence,"Microorganisms are essential for human life. Since time immemorial, every process on earth has been affected by an unending ability of microorganisms to renovate the world. From the last two decades, microbes residing inside plants have gained special attention, and are called endophytes. These microbes have natural potential for production of various bioactive secondary metabolites and can be directly or indi-rectly used as therapeutic agents against a plethora of maladies. For this purpose, endophytic fungi were iso-lated and identified from different healthy, wild and cultivated plants. They were tested against common laboratory bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli) and they showed strong antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria. Most effective isolates of endophytic fungi were further studied for characterization of their organic compounds. Oily n -hexane extract from mycelium and n-hexane fraction of culture filtrates of endophytic fungus Talaromyces trachyspermus revealed the presence of several compounds. The identification of bioactive compounds by GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) is based on the molecular weights, peak areas, mass frag-mentations and retention times.

324,,,Review,"Weeds represent one of the most challenging biotic factors for the agricultural sector, responsible for causing significant losses in important agricultural crops. Traditional herbicides have managed to keep weeds at bay, but overuse has resulted in negative environmental and toxicological impacts, including the increase of herbicide-resistant species. Within this context, the use of biologically derived (bio-)herbicides represents a promising solution because they are able to provide the desired phytotoxic effects while causing less toxic environmental damage. In recent years, bioactive secondary metabolites, in particular those bio-synthesized by endophytic fungi, have been shown to be promising sources of novel compounds that can be exploited in agriculture, including their use in weed control. Endophytic fungi have the ability to produce volatile and nonvolatile compounds with broad phytotoxic activity. In addition, as a result of the beneficial relationships they establish with their host plants, they are part of the colonization mechanism and can provide protection for their hosts. As such, endophytic fungi can be exploited as bioherbicides and as research tools. In this review, we cover 100 nonvolatile secondary metabolites with phytotoxic activity and more than 20 volatile organic compounds in a mixture, produced by 28 isolates of endophytic fungi from 21 host plant families, collected in 8 countries. This information can form the basis for the application of endophytic fungal compounds in weed control.","Macías-Rubalcava, ML; Garrido-Santos, MY",NA,,,"Macias-Rubalcava, Martha Lydia; Garrido-Santos, Monserrat Yesenia",NA,Phytotoxic compounds from endophytic fungi,APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0175-7598,1432-0614,,NA,NA,FEB,2022,106,3,,,NA,931,950,,10.1007/s00253-022-11773-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-022-11773-w,,22-Jan,NA,NA,NA,NA,35039926,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000743425000002,View Full Record in Web of Science,324,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,
325,,,Review,This chapter focuses on the relatively new field of research on endophytic fungi of trees that directly improve plant growth. Endophytic fungi of Scots pine and Norway spruce enhance root development of seedlings and cuttings. Endophytic yeast strains isolated from poplar trees can increase overall growth of not only poplar but also of crop plants. Both groups of endophytic fungi were shown to produce plant hormones. This chapter provides a brief review of these few cases in which endophytic fungi of trees were shown to directly increase plant growth and it serves as a call for more research into this important area.,"Doty, SL",NA,"Pirttila, AM; Frank, AC",,"Doty, Sharon Lafferty",NA,Growth-Promoting Endophytic Fungi of Forest Trees,ENDOPHYTES OF FOREST TREE: BIOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS,Forestry Sciences,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0924-5480,1875-1334,978-94-007-1598-1,NA,NA,,2011,80,,,,NA,151,156,,10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8_9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8_9,10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000294391600009,View Full Record in Web of Science,325,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,
326,,,Review,"Agricultural productivity suffers a heavy loss due to plant pathogens, insect pests and various abiotic stresses. Agriculture being the world's largest economic sector, it is the need of time to find and establish the ideal strategy for sustainable agriculture and improvement in crop growth. Endophytes are microorganisms that asymptomatically grow within the plant tissues without causing any disease to the host. Endophytic fungi live in symbiotic association with plants and play an important role in plant growth promotion, higher seed yield and plants resistant to various biotic, abiotic stresses and diseases. Many are able to produce antimicrobial compounds, plant growth hormones and various agrochemical bioactive metabolites. These mycoendophytes hold enormous potential for the development of eco-friendly and economically viable agricultural products. In this review we focused on the endophytic fungi recovered from different medicinal plants, their active principles involved in plant growth enhancement and the applications of fungal endophytes in agriculture. Moreover, we also discussed about endophytic fungi and their pragmatic approach towards sustainable food and agriculture.","Rai, M; Rathod, D; Agarkar, G; Dar, M; Brestic, M; Pastore, GM; Marostica, MR Jr",NA,,,"Rai, Mahendra; Rathod, Dnyaneshwar; Agarkar, Gauravi; Dar, Mudasir; Brestic, Marian; Pastore, Glaucia Maria; Marostica Junior, Mario Roberto",NA,Fungal growth promotor endophytes: a pragmatic approach towards sustainable food and agriculture,SYMBIOSIS,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Junior, Mario Roberto Marostica/P-5936-2018; University, Sant Gadge Baba Amravati/AAN-5820-2021; Rai, Mahendra/ABG-6511-2021; Brestic, Marian/A-8263-2012; Rai, Mahendra/AAG-3336-2019","Junior, Mario Roberto Marostica/0000-0001-8877-3160; University, Sant Gadge Baba Amravati/0000-0002-3759-6755; Brestic, Marian/0000-0003-3470-6100; Rai, Mahendra/0000-0003-0291-0422; Brestic, Marian/0000-0002-6597-7838; Dar, Mudasir A./0000-0001-6063-3385",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0334-5114,1878-7665,,NA,NA,FEB,2014,62,2,,,NA,63,79,,10.1007/s13199-014-0273-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-014-0273-3,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000334425700001,View Full Record in Web of Science,326,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,
327,,,Review,"With more than 110,000 varieties of rice, it is a sustainable source of energy for almost half of the human population. Rice production has seen exponential growth with time; as of now, it is the third highest-produced agricultural commodity. However, the recent climate changes have gravely affected rice cultivation, leaving future production skeptical. In such atypical circumstances, the utilization of a unique symbiotic association of endophytic fungi and plants represents a sustainable alternative. Endophytic fungi are of crucial importance to the nutrient cycle of the plant, and it can be anticipated that no synthetic molecule can provide the plant with such a wide range of benefits. Over the last decade, numerous studies have reported the ability of endophytic fungi to colonize rice plants successfully. These endophytes exhibit various properties, such as phytohormone production, mineral solubilization, and siderophore production. In addition, they also compensate for environ-mental constraints. This review highlights the work using endophytic fungi to improve rice cultivation over the last decade. The plant growth-promoting attributes of endophytic fungi, their role, and their effect under major abiotic stresses on different varieties of rice plants are discussed.","Sodhi, GK; Saxena, S",NA,,,"Sodhi, Gurleen Kaur; Saxena, Sanjai",NA,Plant growth promotion and abiotic stress mitigation in rice using endophytic fungi: Advances made in the last decade,ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Saxena, Sanjai/E-5667-2012","Saxena, Sanjai/0000-0003-0025-8362; Sodhi, Gurleen Kaur/0000-0001-6585-9578",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0098-8472,1873-7307,,NA,NA,MAY,2023,209,,,,NA,,,105312,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2023.105312,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2023.105312,,23-Mar,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000966540800001,View Full Record in Web of Science,327,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

332,,,Presence,"Many endophytic fungi have the potential to transition into saprotrophic roles when host plant tissues die and enter the litter layer. The decomposition of plant litter by fungi requires moisture, but in the semi-arid regions of the eastern Mediterranean, the native range of Olea europaea, most precipitation occurs during the cooler months of the year. Thus, we hypothesized that the endophytic fungi of O. europaea may also function as psychrotolerant saprotrophs, which we defined here as fungi capable of substantial growth on leaf litter at 4C. We also hypothesized that there is a tradeoff in growth efficiency between low (4C) and moderate (15C) temperatures, expecting that fungal isolates would specialize in either cold or warm conditions. Supporting our first hypothesis, we found that 32 out of 38 fungal isolates were able to break down leaf litter at 4C, but this ability varied widely among isolates, even within the same fungal species. Contrary to our second hypothesis, no clear tradeoff was found between growth at 4C and 15C. In fact, fungi that showed limited saprotrophic growth at 4C also grew poorly at 15C. Since endophytic fungi have early access to plant tissues before they become litter, they may outcompete other decomposer fungi that colonize only post-senescence. Additionally, by being psychrotolerant, certain endophytic fungi could contribute to decomposition during the cooler, wetter months. Thus, we suggest that endophytic fungi in Olea europaea may play a significant role in litter decomposition and nutrient cycling within these ecosystems.",,NA,,,,NA,,,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,,NA,NA,,NA,NA,,,,NA,,,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,332,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

371,,,Review,"Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous microorganisms that establish mutualistic relationships with plants, inhabiting tissues without causing disease. Recent studies have revealed that these fungi contribute significantly to plant growth, nutrient cycling, and stress tolerance. Fungal endophytes influence plant physiological processes through mechanisms such as enhanced nutrient absorption, production of plant growth hormones, and protection against abiotic and biotic stressors. For instance, certain endophytes can improve drought resistance by promoting root elongation and increasing water retention in leaves. Other endophytes are known to synthesize secondary metabolites that provide plants with resistance to herbivores and pathogens. The role of fungal endophytes in plant health has garnered attention in agricultural research, where endophyte-based biocontrol strategies are being explored for sustainable crop protection. Furthermore, the diversity and specificity of endophytic fungal communities in different plant species, as well as their variable presence in distinct plant tissues, suggest a dynamic interaction shaped by environmental and host-specific factors. However, challenges remain in understanding the complex interactions between fungal endophytes, plant hosts, and the environment.

Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have revealed that fungal endophyte communities are highly diverse, with species-specific interactions occurring within different plant species. These fungi are found across all plant tissues, but their colonization patterns vary depending on the plant species, age, and environmental conditions. Fungal endophytes contribute to forest ecosystem stability by enhancing plant resistance to pathogens, herbivores, and environmental stresses such as drought or extreme temperatures. Additionally, some endophytic fungi contribute to nutrient cycling by breaking down complex organic matter, releasing essential nutrients to plants and soil organisms. Notably, endophytes in tropical forests often exhibit greater diversity compared to temperate forests, which suggests that environmental factors, including temperature and humidity, play a major role in shaping fungal communities.

373,,,Review,"The agricultural industry faces increasing challenges from plant diseases and pest infestations, leading to the widespread use of chemical pesticides. In response, the potential of fungal endophytes as biocontrol agents has become a topic of great interest. Endophytic fungi have demonstrated the ability to suppress plant pathogens, enhance plant growth, and protect against abiotic stresses, making them promising candidates for integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. This review examines the mechanisms by which endophytic fungi act as biocontrol agents, including the production of antifungal and antibacterial compounds, competition for nutrients, and the induction of plant immune responses. We also explore the potential of fungal endophytes in promoting plant resistance to herbivory and facilitating plant-microbe interactions that enhance overall plant health. Despite these promising benefits, several challenges remain in the practical application of endophytes in agriculture, such as the difficulty of isolating and culturing beneficial endophytes, the need for precise strain selection, and the stability of endophyte-plant interactions under field conditions.

388,,,Presence,"Foliar endophytic fungi (FEF) are diverse and ubiquitously associated with photosynthetic land plants. However, processes shaping FEF assemblages remain poorly understood. Previous studies have indicated that host identity and host habitat are contributing factors, but these factors are often difficult to disentangle. In this study, we studied FEF assemblages from plants grown in a botanical garden, enabling us to minimize the variation in abiotic environmental conditions and fungal dispersal capacity. FEF assemblages from 46 Ficus species were sequenced using next-generation methods, and the results indicated that closely related host species had clearly differentiated FEF assemblages. Furthermore, host phylogenetic proximity was significantly correlated with the similarity of their FEF assemblages. In the canonical correspondence analysis, eleven leaf traits explained 32.9% of the total variation in FEF assemblages, whereas six traits (specific leaf area, leaf N content, leaf pH, toughness, latex alkaloid content, and latex volume per leaf area) were significant in the first two dimensions of ordination space. In the multiple regression on distance matrix analysis, 21.0% of the total variance in FEF assemblage was explained by both host phylogeny and leaf traits while phylogeny alone explained 7.9% of the variance. Thus, our findings suggest that both evolutionary and ecological processes are involved in shaping FEF assemblages.","Liu, JW; Zhao, J; Wang, G; Chen, J",NA,,,"Liu, Junwei; Zhao, Jin; Wang, Gang; Chen, Jin",NA,Host identity and phylogeny shape the foliar endophytic fungal assemblages of Ficus,ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"wang, gang/ITT-0670-2023; Lu, Jianhong/IYT-3322-2023; Jiang, Cheng/JHU-0179-2023",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2045-7758,,,NA,NA,SEP,2019,9,18,,,NA,10472,10482,,10.1002/ece3.5568,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.5568,,19-Aug,NA,NA,NA,NA,31624561,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000481062000001,View Full Record in Web of Science,388,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four isolates of endophytic fungi, i.e. Cercospora nicotianae isolate H5, Curvularia sp. isolate H12, Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 and AC-4.5 were applied as seed treatment and leaf spray on 2 chilli varieties, 'Biola' and 'Luwes'. Observations of incubation period showed that delayed symptom occurred on application of Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 and Curvularia sp. isolate H12. Disease incidence reached 100 % in all treatments. Less severe symptom was observed on application of Curvularia sp. isolate H12. Most plants infected by PYLCIV showed obvious symptoms of yellow mosaic, leaf curling and stunting. Plant productivity analysis showed that application of Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 resulted higher fruit weight and this treatment may induce tolerant response of the plants to PYLCIV infection.

Members of the deuteromycotina were more prevalent than ascomycotina and others. The result was quite encouraging in terms of maximum isolates recovery from hyphomycetes (78.5%) followed by ascomycetes (8.9%) and coelomycetes (7.6%) respectively, which corroborates previous studies in same area. However, 5.1% isolates remained unidentified and were classified under Mycelia Sterilia. No isolate was obtained from either basidiomycotina or from zygomycotina. Fusarium spp. had maximum colonization frequency (8.00%) in this plant.

391,,,Presence,"Introduction In addition to the mycotoxin swainsonine, the locoweed endophytic fungus Alternaria oxytropis (Pleosporaceae) also produces a series of rarely reported, highly oxygenated bicyclic guaiane sesquiterpenoids. Few investigations on the electrospray tandem mass fragmentation pattern of this sesquiterpenoid have been reported. Objectives We aimed to analyze and detect new guaiane sesquiterpenoid analogues from crude extracts of the locoweed endophytic fungus A. oxytropis by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS experiments. Materials and Methods Oxytropiols A-J (1-10) and the extract of the locoweed endophytic fungus A. oxytropis were analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS in positive mode. Results Typical neutral losses, McLafferty rearrangement, 1,2-rearrangement, and 1,3-rearrangement were considered to be the main fragmentation patterns for the [M + H](+)/[M + Na](+) ions of 1-10 by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS experiments, and possible fragmentation pathways of 1-10 were suggested. A unique and undescribed analogue named oxytropiol K (11) was found in the extract based on UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis. Compound 11 was isolated and elucidated by NMR spectrometry, and its UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis was consistent with the fragmentation pathways of 1-10. Conclusion The results further support that UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS is a powerful and sensitive tool for the characterization of known compounds (dereplication) and the detection of new analogues from crude extracts and imply that the locoweed endophytic fungus A. oxytropis, with few chemical investigations, is an important resource for undescribed metabolites.","Tan, XM; Li, Q; Wang, YD; Wang, TL; Yang, J; Sun, BD; Guo, LP; Ding, G",NA,,,"Tan, Xiang-Mei; Li, Qi; Wang, Yan-Duo; Wang, Tie-Lin; Yang, Jian; Sun, Bing-Da; Guo, Lan-Ping; Ding, Gang",NA,UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis of the guaiane sesquiterpenoids oxytropiols A-J and detection of undescribed analogues from the locoweed endophytic fungus Alternaria oxytropis (Pleosporaceae),PHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"tan, xiangmei/GZA-7369-2022",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0958-0344,1099-1565,,NA,NA,APR,2022,33,3,,,NA,344,354,,10.1002/pca.3092,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.3092,,21-Nov,NA,NA,NA,NA,34755399,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000716097400001,View Full Record in Web of Science,391,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flavopiridol, a semi-synthetic derivative of rohitukine is a potent CDK inhibitor and is currently in Phase III clinical trials. In this study, the isolation of an endophytic fungus, Fusarium proliferatum (MTCC 9690) from the inner bark tissue of Dysoxylum binectariferum Hook.f (Meliaceae) is reported. The endophytic fungus produces rohitukine when cultured in shake flasks containing potato dextrose broth. The yield of rohitukine was 186 mu g/100 g dry mycelial weight, substantially lower than that produced by the host tissue. The compound from the fungus was authenticated by comparing the LC-HRMS and LC-HRMS/MS spectra with those of the reference standard and that produced by the host plant.

Endophytic microorganisms are those that can be isolated inside plant tissues and can be a new source to production of enzymes with different potentialities. The objective of this study was to describe the richness of endophytic fungi from O. ficus-indica and to detect the capacity of these species to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. Forty-four endophytic fungi species were isolated. Among them, the most commonly found were Cladosporium cladosporioides (20.43%) and C. sphaerospermum (15.99%). Acremonium terricola, Monodictys castaneae, Penicillium glandicola, Phoma tropica and Tetraploa aristata are being reported for the first time as endophytic fungi for Brazil. The majority of isolated fungi exhibited enzymatic potential. Aspergillus japonicus and P. glandicola presented pectinolytic activity. Xylaria sp. was the most important among the other 14 species with positive cellulase activity. All 24 isolates analysed were xylanase-positive. Protease was best produced by isolate PF103. The results indicate that there is a significant richness of endophytic fungi in O. ficus-indica, and that these isolates indicate promising potential for deployment in biotechnological processes involving production of pectinases, cellulases, xylanases and proteases.","Bezerra, JDP; Santos, MGS; Svedese, VM; Lima, DMM; Fernandes, MJS; Paiva, LM; Souza-Motta, CM",NA,,,"Bezerra, J.

402,,,Review,"Medicinal plants are an important source of bioactive compounds and have been used to isolate various bioactive compounds having industrial applications. The demand for plants derived bioactive molecules is increasing gradually. However, the extensive use of these plants to extract bioactive molecules has threatened many plant species. Moreover, extracting bioactive molecules from these plants is laborious, costly, and time-consuming. So, some alternative sources and strategies are urgently needed to produce these bioactive molecules similar to that of plant origin. However, the interest in new bioactive molecules has recently shifted from plants to endophytic fungi because many fungi produce bioactive molecules similar to their host plant. Endophytic fungi live in mutualistic association within the healthy plant tissue without causing disease symptoms to the host plant. These fungi are a treasure house of novel bioactive molecules having broad pharmaceutical, industrial, and agricultural applications. The rapid increase in publications in this domain over the last three decades proves that natural product biologists and chemists are paying great attention to the natural bioactive products from endophytic fungi. Though endophytes are source of novel bioactive molecules but there is need of advanced technologies like clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) and epigenetic modifiers to enhance the production of compounds having industrial applications. This review provides an overview of the various industrial applications of bioactive molecules produced by endophytic fungi and the rationale behind selecting specific plants for fungal endophyte isolation. Overall, this study presents the current state of knowledge and highlights the potential of endophytic fungi for developing alternative therapies for drug-resistant infections.","Anand, K; Kumar, V; Prasher, IB; Sethi, M; Raj, H; Ranjan, H; Chand, S; Pandey, GK",NA,,,"Anand, Kumar; Kumar, Vijay; Prasher, Indu Bhushan; Sethi, Megha; Raj, Harsh; Ranjan, Himanshu; Chand, Subhash; Pandey, Gaurav Kumar",NA,Bioactive molecules from fungal endophytes and their applications in pharmaceutical industries: challenges and future scope,JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,"Kumar, Vijay/0000-0001-7935-3711",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0233-111X,1521-4028,,NA,NA,JUL,2023,63,7,,SI,NA,690,708,,10.1002/jobm.202200696,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.202200696,,23-Mar,NA,NA,NA,NA,36998101,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000961385800001,View Full Record in Web of Science,402,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

407,,,Presence,"Glioblastoma is the most devastating primary brain tumor. Current treatment is palliative, making necessary the development of new therapeutic strategies to offer alternatives to patients. Therefore, endophytes represent an interesting source of natural metabolites with anticancer potential. These microorganisms reside in tissues of living plants and act to improve their growth. Evidence revealed that several medicinal plants are colonized by endophytic fungi producer of antitumor metabolites. Achyrocline satureioides is a Brazilian medicinal plant characterized by its properties against gastrointestinal disturbances, anticancer and antioxidant effects. However, there are no reports describing the endophytic composition of A. satureioides. The present study proposes the isolation of endophytic fungus from A. satureioides, extract preparation, phytochemical characterization and evaluation of its antiglioma potential. Our data showed that crude extracts of endophyte decreased glioma viability with IC50 values of 1.60-1.63 mu g/mL to eDCM (dichloromethane extract) and 37.30-55.12 mu g/mL to eEtAc (ethyl acetate extract), respectively. Crude extracts induced cell death by apoptosis with modulation of redox status. In order to bioprospect anticancer metabolites, endophytic fungus extracts were subjected to guided fractionation and purification yielded five fractions of each extract. Six of ten fractions showed selective antiproliferative activity against glioma cells, with IC50 values ranged from 0.95 to 131.3 mu g/mL. F3(DCM) (from eDCM) and F3(EtA)(c) (from eEtAc) fractions promoted C6 glioma toxicity with IC50 of 1.0 and 27.05 mu g/mL, respectively. F3(EtA)(c) fraction induced late apoptosis and arrest in G2/M stage, while F3(DCM) promoted apoptosis with arrest in Sub-G1 phase. Moreover, F3(DCM) increased antioxidant defense and decreased ROS production. Additionally, F3(DCM) showed no cytotoxic activity against astrocytes, revealing selective effect. Based on promising potential of F3(DCM), we identified the production of Sch-642305, a lactone, which showed antiproliferative properties with IC50 values of 1.1 and 7.6 mu g/mL to C6 and U138MG gliomas, respectively. Sch-642305 promoted arrest on cell cycle in G2/M inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, this lactone decreased glioma cell migration and modulated redox status, increasing superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and enhancing sulfhydryl content, consequently suppressing reactive species of oxygen generation.

The nature of the symbiotic interaction that occurs between two organisms (the insect and the fungus), may be either mutualistic or parasitic, or between these two extremes. However, the triangular relationship involving three organisms, viz., an insect, a fungus, and a vascular plant is a relationship that is more complicated than what can be described as either mutualism or parasitism, and may represent facets of both. Recent research has revealed such a complex relationship in the vertically transmitted type-I endophytes living within agriculturally important grasses and the pestiferous insects that attack them. The intricacy of the association depends on the endophytic fungus-grass association and the insect present. Secondary compounds produced in the endophytic fungus-grass association can provide grasses with resistance to herbivores resulting in mutualistic relationship between the fungus and the plant that has negative consequences for herbivorous insects. The horizontally transmitted nongrass type-II endophytes are far less well studied and as such their ecological roles are not fully understood. This forum article explores the intricacy of dependence in such complex triangular relationships drawing from well-established examples from the fungi that live as endophytes in vascular plants and how they impact on the biology and evolution of free-living as well as concealed (e. g., gall-inducing, gall-inhabiting) insects. Recent developments with the inoculation of strains of type-I fungal endophytes into grasses and their commercialization are discussed, along with the possible roles the endophytic fungi play in the galls induced by the Cecidomyiidae (Diptera).","Raman, A; Wheatley, W; Popay, A",NA,,,"Raman, A.; Wheatley, W.; Popay, A.",NA,Endophytic Fungus-Vascular Plant-Insect Interactions,ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,"Raman, Anantanarayanan/0000-0002-7293-7412; Popay, Alison/0000-0002-0201-5308",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0046-225X,1938-2936,,NA,NA,JUN,2012,41,3,,,NA,433,447,,10.1603/EN11317,http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EN11317,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,22732600,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000305475600004,View Full Record in Web of Science,411,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this work was to evaluate the interaction of the dark septate endophytic fungi with cowpea plants under salt stress. Endophytic fungi were isolated from Vochysia divergens root system, and molecular identification of fungi was performed by sequencing the ITS region. We selected and identified Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and Melanconiella elegans-21W2 for their ability to infect V. divergens root in vitro with development of typical dark septate fungi structures. Cowpea plants-inoculated or not inoculated with Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and M. elegans 21W2-were cultivated in 5-L pots under greenhouse conditions and submitted to four different electrical conductivities of irrigation water (1.2, 2.2, 3.6, and 5.0 dS m(-1)). The salinity caused decrease in leaf concentration of K and increased leaf concentration of calcium, sodium, and chlorine; and no influence of dark septate endophytic fungi was observed in these responses. On the other hand, root colonization with Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and M. elegans 21W2 resulted in improved nutrition with N and P in cowpea under salt stress, favoring the growth and rate of liquid photosynthesis.

Since endophytic fungi possess the natural capacity to produce the similar secondary metabolite to that of their host plants, they are promising as alternative sources of plant bioactive natural products. In this study, in order to search for SSd-producing strains, endophytes were isolated from B. scorzonerifolium and were authenticated by the ITS sequence and the translation elongation factor-1alpha gene (TEF-1 alpha) sequence analysis. The profile of metabolites present in the crude exacts was carried out by ultra performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) analysis. The results showed that two strains, CHS2 and CHS3 from B. scorzonerifolium could produce SSd by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS analysis, and the amount of SSd produced by strain CHS2 and CHS3 were about 2.17 and 2.40 mu g/mL, respectively. CHS2 and CHS3 showed a close phylogenetic relationship to Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium acuminatum, respectively.

414,,,Presence,"Plants cope with abiotic stress in several ways, including by collaborating with microorganisms. Epichloe, an endophytic fungus, has been shown to improve plant tolerance to extreme external environments. Hordeum bogdanii is a known salt-tolerant plant with the potential to improve alkaline lands. NHX1 plays a key role in the transport of ions in the cell and is overexpressed in plants with increased salt tolerance. However, the expression levels of HbNHX1 in Epichloe endophytic fungal symbionts in H. bogdanii have not been elucidated. We used Hordeum bogdanii (E+) with the endophytic fungi Epichloe bromicola and H. bogdanii (E-) without the endophytic fungi and compared the differences in the ion content and HbNHX1 expression between the shoots and roots of E+ and E- plants under alkaline stress. The absorption capacity of both K+ and Na+ of H. bogdanii with endophytic fungi was higher than that without endophytic fungi. In the absence of alkaline stress, endophytic fungi significantly reduced the Cl- content in the host H. bogdanii. Alkaline stress reduced SO42- content in H. bogdanii; however, compared with E-, endophytic fungi increased the content of SO42- in E+ plants. With an increase in the alkaline concentration, the expression of HbNHX1 in the roots of H. bogdanii with endophytic fungus exhibited an upward trend, whereas the expression in the shoots exhibited a downward trend first and then an upward trend. Under 100 mmol center dot L-1 mixed alkaline stress, the expression of HbNHX1 in E+ was significantly higher than that in E-, indicating that endophytic fungi could increase the Na+ region in vacuoles. The external environment affects the regulation of endophytic fungi in H. bogdanii and that endophytic fungi can play a key role in soil salinization. Therefore, the findings of this study will provide technical support and a theoretical basis for better utilization of endophytic fungi from H. bogdanii in saline land improvement.","Long, F; Hu, MF; Chen, S; Bao, GS; Dan, H; Chen, SH",NA,,,"Long, Feng; Hu, Meng-Fei; Chen, Sheng; Bao, Gen-Sheng; Dan, Han; Chen, Shui-Hong",NA,Endophytic Fungi Regulate HbNHX1 Expression and Ion Balance in Hordeum bogdanii under Alkaline Stress,JOURNAL OF FUNGI,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hu, Mengfei/ABG-3590-2020; Long, Feng/AAN-4694-2021","Hu, Mengfei/0000-0003-4272-144X;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2309-608X,,NA,NA,MAR,2023,9,3,,,NA,,,331,10.3390/jof9030331,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof9030331,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,36983499,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000958230700001,View Full Record in Web of Science,414,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,
415,,,Presence,"Background: Paclitaxel (Taxol (TM)) is an important anticancer drug with a unique mode of action. The biosynthesis of paclitaxel had been considered restricted to the Taxus species until it was discovered in Taxomyces andreanae, an endophytic fungus of T. brevifolia. Subsequently, paclitaxel was found in hazel (Corylus avellana L.) and in several other endophytic fungi. The distribution of paclitaxel in plants and endophytic fungi and the reported sequence homology of key genes in paclitaxel biosynthesis between plant and fungi species raises the question about whether the origin of this pathway in these two physically associated groups could have been facilitated by horizontal gene transfer. Results: The ability of the endophytic fungus of hazel Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 to independently synthesize paclitaxel was established by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance. The genome of Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 was sequenced and gene candidates that may be involved in paclitaxel biosynthesis were identified by comparison with the 13 known paclitaxel biosynthetic genes in Taxus. We found that paclitaxel biosynthetic gene candidates in P. aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 have evolved independently and that horizontal gene transfer between this endophytic fungus and its plant host is unlikely. Conclusions: Our findings shed new light on how paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungi synthesize paclitaxel, and will facilitate metabolic engineering for the industrial production of paclitaxel from fungi.","Yang, YF; Zhao, HN; Barrero, RA; Zhang, BH; Sun, GL; Wilson, IW; Xie, FL; Walker, KD; Parks, JW; Bruce, R; Guo, GW; Chen, L; Zhang, Y; Huang, X; Tang, Q; Liu, HW; Bellgard, MI; Qiu, DY; Lai, JS; Hoffman, A",NA,,,"Yang, Yanfang; Zhao, Hainan; Barrero, Roberto A.; Zhang, Baohong; Sun, Guiling; Wilson, Iain W.; Xie, Fuliang; Walker, Kevin D.; Parks, Joshua W.; Bruce, Robert; Guo, Guangwu; Chen, Li; Zhang, Yong; Huang, Xin; Tang, Qi; Liu, Hongwei; Bellgard, Matthew I.; Qiu, Deyou; Lai, Jinsheng; Hoffman, Angela",NA,Genome sequencing and analysis of the paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungus Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431,BMC GENOMICS,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wilson, Iain/D-4839-2009; Zhang, Yong/AAS-3454-2020; Zhang, Baohong/O-4948-2016","Wilson, Iain/0000-0002-4626-8059; Bellgard, Matthew/0000-0002-6303-9469; Zhang, Yong/0000-0002-2276-7187; Walker, Kevin/0000-0001-5208-6692; Barrero, Roberto/0000-0002-7735-665X; Tang, Qi/0000-0003-2385-4263",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1471-2164,,,NA,NA,25-Jan,2014,15,,,,NA,,,69,10.1186/1471-2164-15-69,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-15-69,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,24460898,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000332573300001,View Full Record in Web of Science,415,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,
416,,,Presence,"Endophytic fungi constitute a major part of the still unexplored fungal diversity and have gained interest as new biological sources of natural active compounds, including enzymes. Endophytic fungi were isolated from soybean leaves and initially screened on agar plates for the production of CMCase (carboxymethylcellulase), xylanase, amylase and protease. The highest Enzymatic Indexes (IE) were verified for xylanase (2.14 and 1.31) with the fungi M6-A6P5F2 and M12-A5P3F1.2 and CMCase (1.92 and 1.62) with the fungi M13-A9P2F1 and M12-A5P3F1.2, respectively. The production of xylanase and CMCase by the selected fungi was evaluated in submerged cultivation using beechwood xylan and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), as well as sugarcane straw and bagasse in different ratios as carbon sources. Both types of lignocellulosic biomass proved to be good inducers of enzymatic activity. The best xylanase producer among the isolates was identified as Colletotrichum boninense. With this fungus, the highest xylanase activity was obtained with a sugarcane straw-bagasse mixture in a 50:50 ratio (383.63 U mL(-1)), a result superior to that obtained with the use of beechwood xylan (296.65 U mL(-1)). Regardingthe kinetic behavior of the crude xylanase, there was found optimal pH of 5.0 and optimal temperatures of 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C. At 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C, xylanase retained 87% and 76% of its initial catalytic activity, respectively.

However, the factors affecting fungal community formation are unclear. This study is the first to utilize mini-community remodeling to understand the above phenomena. First, high-throughput sequencing technology was applied to explore the community composition and diversity of endophytic fungi in the above-ground tissues (Ea) and below-ground tissues (Eb) of Ephedra sinica. Second, fungi were obtained through culture-dependent technology and used for mini-community remodeling in vitro. Then, the effects of environmental factors, partner fungi, and plant tissue fluid (internal environment) on endophytic fungal community formation were discussed. Results showed that environmental factors played a decisive role in the selection of endophytic fungi, that is, in Ea and Eb, 93.8% and 25.3% of endophytic fungi were halophilic, respectively, and 10.6% and 60.2% fungi were sensitive to high temperature (33 & DEG;C), respectively.

They therefore must obtain all of their nutrients from the apoplastic spaces in the plant. This report is the first comprehensive, biochemically based study of sugar uptake by Acremonium spp. The endophytes (Acremonium typhinum) were isolated from Festuca rubra plants and were grown in culture. Individual colonies were incubated in the presence of [U-C-14] radiolabeled glucose, fructose, or sucrose for 20 minutes and the uptake quantified by scintillation counting. The uptake rates for all three sugars were biphasic, indicating two distinct mechanisms of transport. At low sugar concentrations (below 10 mM) the uptake was saturable and had the characteristics of a carrier-mediated mechanism. At high sugar concentrations (10-100 mM) the uptake was linear suggesting diffusion as the predominant mechanism of uptake. From competition experiments (uptake of labeled sugar in the presence of a different unlabeled sugar) it appeared that there were separate carriers for glucose and fructose. Two mechanisms for sucrose uptake were detected, a sucrose carrier and hexose uptake as a result of cell wall invertase. Cell wall invertase activity of the fungal isolates was inducible by growing the fungi on sucrose containing media.","LAM, CK; BELANGER, FC; WHITE, JF; DAIE, J",NA,NA,NA,"LAM, CK; BELANGER, FC; WHITE, JF; DAIE, J",NA,"MECHANISM AND RATE OF SUGAR UPTAKE BY ACREMONIUM-TYPHINUM, AN ENDOPHYTIC FUNGUS INFECTING FESTUCA-RUBRA - EVIDENCE FOR PRESENCE OF A CELL-WALL INVERTASE IN ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI",MYCOLOGIA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"White, James/C-2280-2009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0027-5514,NA,NA,NA,NA,MAY-JUN,1994,86,3,NA,NA,NA,408,415,NA,10.2307/3760573,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3760573,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1994NZ04600013,NA,480,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This interaction has not been fully considered in many previous studies which used controlled experiments with agronomic or model plant species. Here, we investigated this interaction in a naturally occurring forb (a locoweed species) Oxytropis ochrocephala, its symbiotic endophyte Alternaria oxytropis, and the mycotoxin swainsonine. Host genetic variation was characterized by microsatellite markers. Endophyte infection rate and swainsonine levels were determined by PCR and HPLC, respectively. Genetic markers defined two distinct host populations and revealed that host genetics were significantly correlated with geographical location, elevation, and precipitation. As the host diverged, symbiotic interactions were reduced or failed to produce detectable swainsonine in one host population. Host genotype and precipitation had a significant impact in shaping swainsonine production at the population level. This study highlights the effect of host genotype in influencing this interaction in locoweeds.","He, W; Guo, LW; Wang, L; Zhao, QQ; Guo, LZ; Cao, W; Mur, LAJ; Wei, YH",NA,NA,NA,"He, Wei; Guo, Linwei; Wang, Lei; Zhao, Qianqian; Guo, Lizhu; Cao, Wei; Mur, Luis A.

Neotyphodium fungal endophytes (Clavicipitaceae) are grass symbionts known by their production of alkaloids, toxic for herbivores. Here, we hypothesized that endophytes confer associational protection to non-host plants and change emission of host volatile-compounds. In an outdoor mesocosm experiment, we examined aphid infestation on Trifolium repens plants, in response to Neotyphodium occultans presence in neighbouring Lolium multiflorum. Contrasting levels of Rhizobium were generated in T. repens plants considering that symbiosis with N-2-fixers would influence herbivore abundance. Aphid infestation increased responding to symbiotic status of T. repens plants, when surrounded by non-symbiotic L. multiflorum plants. Endophytes modified the volatile imprints of L. multiflorum plants measured by an electronic nose, suggesting a potential mechanism to benefit neighbours. This associational protection constitutes a new mutualism trait of grass-endophyte symbiosis, becoming a non-private benefit available to other community partners.

The cultivars were Maris Kasba (MK), of Mediterranean origin, and El Palenque (EP), an Argentinian cultivar of temperate origin. The endophyte strains AgResearch isolate (AR501) and the Kentucky (KY31) wild type were compared with nil-endophyte controls. Leaf growth rare of EP plants under water deficit was higher and leaf senescence rate lower than for MK plants (P < 0.05). MK plants showed a greater increase in the proportion of dead leaf tissue than EP plants as water deficit increased (P < 0.05). Stomatal conductance and lamina osmotic adjustment at low soil moisture were lower for MK than EP (P < 0.05).

Many vascular plants are able to form close symbiotic associations with endophytic fungi. Metarhizium is a common plant endophyte found in a large number of ecosystems. This abundant soil fungus is also a pathogen to a large number of insects, which are a source of nitrogen. It is possible that the endophytic capability and insect pathogenicity of Metarhizium are coupled to provide an active method of nitrogen transfer to plant hosts via fungal mycelia. We used soil microcosms to test the ability of M. robertsii to translocate insect-derived nitrogen to plants. Insects were injected with N-15-labeled nitrogen, and we tracked the incorporation of N-15 into amino acids in two plant species, haricot bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), in the presence of M. robertsii.

Diseases caused by Phyllosticta commonly include leaf and fruit spots that can affect economically important plants. The genus is characterized mainly by aseptate and hyaline conidia and ascospores. Its conidia are surrounded by a mucilaginous sheath, with a single mucoid apical appendage while ascospores exhibit a mucoid cap at both ends. Given that many Phyllosticta taxa are cryptic and share similar morphologies, it is arduous to depict taxonomically relevant characters solely on the basis of morphological or ecological features. Coupled with morphological description, multi -locus phylogenetic analyses of species comprising complexes are used to broadly describe this genus and understand species boundaries. Despite several published taxonomic revisions and enumerations of Phyllosticta species, there is still considerable confusion when identifying these taxa. Herein, we establish three new host records for P. capitalensis, and one new geographical record for P. musaechinensis in Thailand, and one new host and geographical record for P. citribrasiliensis in Russia.

Here we studied local adaptation of host plants and possible fitness contribution of such symbiosis in the context of abiotic environmental factors. We conducted a four-way multi-year reciprocal transplant experiment with natural populations of the perennial grass Festuca rubra s.l. from northern and southern Finland, Faroe Islands and Spain. We included F. rubra with and without transmitted symbiotic fungus Epichloe that is vertically transmitted via host seed. We found local adaptation across the European range, as evidenced by higher host fitness of the local geographic origin compared with nonlocals at three of the four studied sites, suggesting that selection pressures are driving evolution in different directions. Abiotic factors did not result in strong fitness effects related to Epichloe symbiosis, indicating that other factors such as herbivory are more likely to contribute to fitness differences between plants naturally occurring with or without Epichloe. Nevertheless, in the case of asymmetric symbiosis that is obligatory for the symbiont, abiotic conditions that affect performance of the host, may also cause selective pressure for the symbiont.","Leinonen, PH; Helander, M; Vazquez-de-Aldana, BR; Zabalgogeazcoa, I; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Leinonen, Paivi; Helander, Marjo; Vazquez-de-Aldana, Beatriz; Zabalgogeazcoa, Inigo; Saikkonen, Kari",NA,Local adaptation in natural European host grass populations with asymmetric symbiosis,PLOS ONE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zabalgogeazcoa, Inigo/F-9523-2016; Leinonen, Paivi/IWV-0880-2023; Vazquez-de-Aldana, Beatriz/A-7760-2008","Zabalgogeazcoa, Inigo/0000-0002-9524-7799; Leinonen, Paivi/0000-0003-0210-5589; Vazquez-de-Aldana, Beatriz/0000-0001-6549-3545; Saikkonen, Kari/0000-0001-5203-9984",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1932-6203,NA,NA,NA,NA,17-Apr,2019,14,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0215510,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215510,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30995278,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000465010000058,NA,486,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

490,,,Presence,"Understanding how species-rich communities persist is a foundational question in ecology. In tropical forests, tree diversity is structured by edaphic factors, climate, and biotic interactions, with seasonality playing an essential role at landscape scales: wetter and less seasonal forests typically harbor higher tree diversity than more seasonal forests. We posited that the abiotic factors shaping tree diversity extend to hyperdiverse symbionts in leaves-fungal endophytes-that influence plant health, function, and resilience to stress. Through surveys in forests across Panama that considered climate, seasonality, and covarying biotic factors, we demonstrate that endophyte richness varies negatively with temperature seasonality. Endophyte community structure and taxonomic composition reflect both temperature seasonality and climate (mean annual temperature and precipitation). Overall our findings highlight the vital role of climate-related factors in shaping the hyperdiversity of these important and little-known symbionts of the trees that, in turn, form the foundations of tropical forest biodiversity.","Oita, S; Ibáñez, A; Lutzoni, F; Miadlikowska, J; Geml, J; Lewis, LA; Hom, EFY; Carbone, I; U'Ren, JM; Arnold, AE",NA,NA,NA,"Oita, Shuzo; Ibanez, Alicia; Lutzoni, Francois; Miadlikowska, Jolanta; Geml, Jozsef; Lewis, Louise A.; Hom, Erik F.

491,,,Both,"Cool-season grasses establish symbioses with vertically transmitted Neotyphodium endophytes widespread in nature. The frequency of endophyte-infected plants in closed populations (i.e., without migrations) depends on both the differential fitness between infected and non-infected plants, and the endophyte-transmission efficiency. Most studies have been focused on the first mechanism ignoring the second. Infection frequency and endophyte transmission from vegetative tissues to seeds were surveyed in two grasses growing in vegetation units that differ in flood and grazing regimes, and soil salinity. Transmission efficiency and infection frequency for tall fescue did not vary significantly and were 0.98 and 1.00, respectively. For Italian ryegrass, transmission efficiency and infection frequency were 0.88 and 0.57 in humid prairies, and 0.96 and 0.96 in the other vegetation units. Only in humid mesophytic meadows, the observed pattern was irrespective of the presence or absence of grazers. Our results suggest that selection forces for endophyte infection are different for both species. Imperfect transmission was only compensated in tall fescue through an increased fitness of infected plants. Interpreting variations of infection frequency only in terms of differential fitness can be misleading, considering that endophyte transmission can be imperfect and variable in nature. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of measuring transmission efficiency.","Gundel, PE; Garibaldi, LA; Tognetti, PM; Aragón, R; Ghersa, CM; Omacini, M",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro E.; Garibaldi, Lucas A.; Tognetti, Pedro M.; Aragon, Roxana; Ghersa, Claudio M.; Omacini, Marina",NA,Imperfect Vertical Transmission of the Endophyte <i>Neotyphodium</i> in Exotic Grasses in Grasslands of the Flooding Pampa,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tognetti, Pedro/AAF-7018-2019; Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Garibaldi, Lucas/D-7302-2013","Garibaldi, Lucas Alejandro/0000-0003-0725-4049; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Tognetti, Pedro M./0000-0001-7358-1334; Omacini, Marina/0000-0003-1460-262X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0095-3628,1432-184X,NA,NA,NA,MAY,2009,57,4,NA,NA,NA,740,748,NA,10.1007/s00248-008-9447-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-008-9447-y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18797956,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000265044900015,NA,491,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

493,,,Both,"Pooideae grasses may be colonized by systemic fungal endophytes. The fitness of endophyte depends entirely on resources and seed transmission from the host plant, while colonized plants may gain increased survival, growth, and reproduction relative to their uncolonized conspecifics. Most research of endophyte-grass interactions have been carried out on few cultivars of tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix) and their symbiont Neotyphodium coenophialum. Lack of studies using wild populations of tall fescue across the species natural distribution range, however, limits the understanding of the ecological and evolutionary role of the symbiosis in nature. We performed a common garden experiment in Southern Finland with three wild, tall fescue populations from northern Europe and the forage cultivar Kentucky-31 (KY-31). For each population, we used naturally endophyte-colonized, naturally endophyte-colonized but endophyte removed (decolonized), and naturally uncolonized plants to separate effects due to the host genotype from the endophyte. We evaluated growth variables and survival in four environmental treatments of varying water and nutrients. Supply of water and nutrients increased plant biomass and reproductive effort in all populations. This effect was higher for KY-31 plants which produced on average 55 % more seeds than wild plants, indicating better adaptation to high resource environments. However, the higher incidence of Claviceps sp. and the low winter survival indicated KY-31 tall fescue is mal-adapted to Northern European conditions. Naturally colonized plants had greater plant biomass (a parts per thousand 12 %), reproductive effort (a parts per thousand 22 %) and seed mass (a parts per thousand 29 %) than naturally uncolonized and decolonized plants. Nonetheless, endophyte colonization did not affect plant survival, and the effects of endophyte colonization on tiller number, panicle/tiller ratio and Claviceps sp. incidence depended on the population origin. In the wild populations, endophyte removal only reduced the number of tillers (a parts per thousand 29 % lower), while the difference between naturally colonized and naturally uncolonized plants was not significant. Our results show that endophyte symbiont increases tall fescue performance in general, but the differences between wild populations and cultivars indicate adaptation to local habitats and agronomic management, respectively. The comparison of naturally endophyte-colonized and decolonized plants suggests certain plant genotype-endophyte combinations found within populations result from local selection pressures.","Gundel, PE; Helander, M; Casas, C; Hamilton, CE; Faeth, SH; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro E.; Helander, Marjo; Casas, Cecilia; Hamilton, Cyd E.; Faeth, Stanley H.; Saikkonen, Kari",NA,<i>Neotyphodium</i> fungal endophyte in tall fescue (<i>Schedonorus phoenix</i>): a comparison of three Northern European wild populations and the cultivar Kentuky-31,FUNGAL DIVERSITY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013","Casas, Cecilia/0000-0003-3538-6081; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Hamilton, Cyd/0000-0002-6378-3407; Saikkonen, Kari/0000-0001-5203-9984; Helander, Marjo/0000-0002-9759-4321",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1560-2745,1878-9129,NA,NA,NA,MAY,2013,60,1,NA,SI,NA,15,24,NA,10.1007/s13225-012-0173-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13225-012-0173-x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000320112900003,NA,493,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major life-history traits and aspects of the epidemiology (isolation, survival, reproduction, dispersal, host selectivity) and control of the oak anthracnose agent are elucidated. The role of weather patterns in disrupting the delicate interaction between the host tree and the microorganism is outlined. The evidence suggests that changes in the climate profoundly alter the plant-endophyte symbiosis, generating conflicts of interest between the partners in the interaction. When such competing interests arise, the survival and reproduction of one member of the interaction do not conform with that of the partner. The interaction becomes thus disadvantageous and harmful to one of the organisms and the symbiosis from mutualistic or neutral turns antagonistic. The fungal partner, which under normal conditions survives in quiescence, with a low biomass, resumes growth but now switches from a latent, asymptomatic occupier of inner oak tissues to an aggressive coloniser that sporulates profusely over the tree surface. The importance of investigating the functioning and the role of the plant-endophyte symbiosis in perennial host trees in natural forests is stressed.","Moricca, S; Ragazzi, A",NA,"Pirttila, AM; Frank, AC",NA,"Moricca, Salvatore; Ragazzi, Alessandro",NA,The Holomorph <i>Apiognomonia quercina</i>/<i>Discula quercina</i> as a Pathogen/Endophyte in Oak,ENDOPHYTES OF FOREST TREE: BIOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS,Forestry Sciences,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0924-5480,1875-1334,978-94-007-1598-1,NA,NA,NA,2011,80,NA,NA,NA,NA,47,66,NA,10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8_3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8_3,10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000294391600003,NA,494,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epacrids and other extant ericoid mycorrhiza-forming plants appear to have a monophyletic origin. In common with many Ericaceae they form ericoid mycorrhizas. ITS sequence data indicate that the fungi forming ericoid mycorrhizas with epacrids and other extant Ericaceae are broadly similar, belonging to a poorly defined group of ascomycetes with phylogenetic affinities to Helotiales. The basic development and structure of ericoid mycorrhizal infections in epacrids is similar to other Ericaceae. However, data are limited on the structure and physiology of both hair roots and ericoid mycorrhizas for all Ericaceae. Relatively little is known about the functional significance of ericoid mycorrhizas in epacrids in southern hemisphere habitats that are often poor in organic matter accumulation. However the abilities of fungal endophytes of epacrids to utilize organic N and P substrates equal those of endophytes from northern hemisphere heathland plant hosts.

501,,,Presence,"In ascomycetes and basidiomycetes, iron-responsive GATA-type transcriptional repressors are involved in regulating iron homeostasis, notably to prevent iron toxicity through control of iron uptake. To date, it has been unknown whether this iron regulator contributes toward mutualistic endosymbiosis of microbes with plants, a system where the endophyte must function within the constraints of an in-host existence, including a dependency on the host for nutrient acquisition. Functional characterization of one such protein, SreA from Epichloe festucae, a fungal endosymbiont of cool-season grasses, indicates that regulation of iron homeostasis processes is important for symbiotic maintenance. The deletion of the sreA gene (Delta sreA) led to iron-dependent aberrant hyphal growth and the gradual loss of endophyte hyphae from perennial ryegrass. SreA negatively regulates the siderophore biosynthesis and high-affinity iron uptake systems of E. festucae, similar to other fungi, resulting in iron accumulation in mutants. Our evidence suggests that SreA is involved in the processes that moderate Epichloe iron acquisition from the plant apoplast, because overharvesting of iron in Delta sreA mutants was detected as premature chlorosis of the host using a hydroponic plant growth assay. E. festucae appears to have a tightly regulated iron management system, involving SreA that balances endophyte growth with its survival and prevents overcompetition with the host for iron in the intercellular niche, thus promoting mutualistic associations. Mutations that interfere with Epichloe iron management negatively affect iron-dependent fungal growth and destabilize mutualistic Epichloe -ryegrass associations.","Forester, NT; Lane, GA; McKenzie, CM; Lamont, IL; Johnson, LJ",NA,NA,NA,"Forester, Natasha T.; Lane, Geoffrey A.; McKenzie, Catherine M.; Lamont, Iain L.; Johnson, Linda J.",NA,The Role of SreA-Mediated Iron Regulation in Maintaining Epichloe <i>festucae-Lolium</i> <i>perenne</i> Symbioses,MOLECULAR PLANT-MICROBE INTERACTIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"McKenzie, Catherine/O-6723-2018","McKenzie, Catherine/0000-0002-3075-954X; Forester, Natasha Talei/0000-0002-9329-1710",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0894-0282,1943-7706,NA,NA,NA,OCT,2019,32,10,NA,NA,NA,1324,1335,NA,10.1094/MPMI-03-19-0060-R,http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/MPMI-03-19-0060-R,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31107632,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000488776300009,NA,501,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,
502,,,Presence,"Observations at three grassland sites in England and Wales on nine perennial ryegrass genotypes infected or not by the endophytic fungus Acremonium lolii, showed that populations of plant-parasitic nematodes were not reduced on endophyte-infected plants during the two years of the experiment. There was evidence at two sites, where numbers of plant nematodes increased during the trial period, that there were significantly more nematodes on endophyte-infected plants. At the third site, where nematode populations did not increase, there was no difference between endophyte treatments. Nematode population changes on one genotype, known to grow better when endophyte-infected, were similar to the average for all genotypes. In a glasshouse pot experiment, invasion and development of root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne naasi, was the same on endophyte-infected and endophyte-free plants of the responsive genotype. In samples from field plots and in the pot experiment, roots of endophyte-infected plants were larger and probably accounted for the increased nematode populations.","COOK, R; LEWIS, GC; MIZEN, KA",NA,NA,NA,"COOK, R; LEWIS, GC; MIZEN, KA",NA,"EFFECTS ON PLANT-PARASITIC NEMATODES OF INFECTION OF PERENNIAL RYEGRASS, LOLIUM-PERENNE, BY THE ENDOPHYTIC FUNGUS, ACREMONIUM-LOLII",CROP PROTECTION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0261-2194,NA,NA,NA,NA,OCT,1991,10,5,NA,NA,NA,403,407,NA,10.1016/S0261-2194(06)80032-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0261-2194(06)80032-3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1991GH97700013,NA,502,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,
503,,,Presence,"Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is a C-3 perennial grass noted for its persistence in harsh environments. Tall fescue persistence is enhanced by Acremonium coenophialum, a mutualistic fungal endophyte that increases resistance to drought, pathogens, and insects. This research was conducted to identify and elicit biochemical mechanism(s) that could account for tall fescue persistence. In initial studies, two cultivars known to differ in persistence were analyzed for chitinase, an antifungal hydrolase associated with disease resistance in other plants. Acremonium-infected Kentucky 31 (KY31), a persistent cultivar, and Johnstone, a nonpersistent cultivar, were inoculated with the parasitic nematode, Meloidogyne marylandi, grown for 50 days, and analyzed at 10-day intervals. Chitinase fluctuated throughout the 50-day period of seedling development, and activity was highest in the persistent Acremonium-infected KY31. In addition, chitinase was elicited by parasitic M. marylandi and expressed systemically. Subsequent studies were conducted to determine whether or not mutualistic Acremonium could increase chitinase activity. Genetically identical KY31, with and without Acremonium, were grown for 25 days and analyzed for chitinase at 5-day intervals. After 20 days, Acremonium-infected KY31 expressed more chitinase than Acremonium-free KY31. We concluded that chitinase is related to tall fescue persistence; it was highest in the most persistent cultivar, increased under pathogen attack, and increased in the presence of Acremonium, a symbiont known to enhance disease resistance.","ROBERTS, CA; MAREK, SM; NIBLACK, TL; KARR, AL",NA,NA,NA,"ROBERTS, CA; MAREK, SM; NIBLACK, TL; KARR, AL",NA,PARASITIC MELOIDOGYNE AND MUTUALISTIC ACREMONIUM INCREASE CHITINASE IN TALL FESCUE,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Marek, Stephen/Q-6911-2019; Marek, Stephen/M-9865-2013","Marek, Stephen/0000-0002-0146-8049",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0098-0331,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUL,1992,18,7,NA,NA,NA,1107,1116,NA,10.1007/BF00980066,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00980066,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24254151,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1992JD59000013,NA,503,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,
504,,,Presence,"Tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) infected by Epichloe coenophiala contains ergot alkaloids responsible for fescue toxicosis in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States, with only a few cases occurring in Europe. The detection of Epichloe in 166 L. arundinaceum collected in southern France revealed that 60% were infected, 51% being high ergovaline producers. The ergovaline level in endophyte-infected tall fescue Kentucky 31 was monitored during 3 years in various parts of the plant. Maturation of plants, recorded according to the BBCH scale, appeared to be the main factor for estimating the risk of toxicity. Ergovaline levels of =300 mu g/kg dry matter were obtained at the end of spring, the beginning of autumn, and mid-winter. Positive correlation between ergovaline level and cumulative degree-d was observed, whereas rainfall had no effect. These results suggest that the lack of fescue toxicosis observed in France cannot be explained by the lack of ergovaline in tall fescue.","Repussard, C; Zbib, N; Tardieu, D; Guerre, P",NA,NA,NA,"Repussard, Celine; Zbib, Nasrallah; Tardieu, Didier; Guerre, Philippe",NA,Endophyte Infection of Tall Fescue and the Impact of Climatic Factors on Ergovaline Concentrations in Field Crops Cultivated in Southern France,JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"GUERRE, Philippe/ABA-8286-2020","GUERRE, Philippe/0000-0002-9777-3784",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0021-8561,1520-5118,NA,NA,NA,1-Oct,2014,62,39,NA,NA,NA,9609,9614,NA,10.1021/jf503015m,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf503015m,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25192465,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000342609500028,NA,504,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, molecular techniques have enabled the rapid detection and identifi cation of targeted endophyte species, and next-generation sequencing technology provides an opportunity to obtain comprehensive information on endophytic communities, directly from plant tissue. In order to achieve accurate detection from internal tissues, surface microbes and associated deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) must be eliminated, with particular consideration for the type of plant tissue and the efficacy of the surface sterilization procedure used. The methodology described later was developed specifically for detection of DNA from the entomopathogenic fungal endophyte Beauveria bassiana (Vuillemin) (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) in various tissues of Zea mays (L.). However, the protocol may be easily applied to other fungi and bacterial endophytes. Included is a stringent sodium hypochlorite-based surface sterilization protocol for plant material in preparation for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect target DNA within plant tissue. Included are a treatment for dealing with surface DNA contamination and a novel procedure for assessing the efficacy of surface sterilization using PCR.","McKinnon, AC",NA,"Glare, TR; MoranDiez, ME",NA,"McKinnon, Aimee C.",NA,Plant Tissue Preparation for the Detection of an Endophytic Fungus <i>In Planta</i>,MICROBIAL-BASED BIOPESTICIDES: METHODS AND PROTOCOLS,Methods in Molecular Biology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1064-3745,NA,978-1-4939-6367-6; 978-1-4939-6365-2,NA,NA,NA,2016,1477,NA,NA,NA,NA,167,173,NA,10.1007/978-1-4939-6367-6_13,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-6367-6_13,10.1007/978-1-4939-6367-6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27565499,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000399773100014,NA,505,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,
506,,,Presence,"The molecular analysis of the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis started at the beginning of this decade. The paper summarises the work of the ‘Laboratorium für Molekulare Genetik arbuskulärer Mykorrhiza’ at the MPI für terrestrische Mikrobiologie in Marburg on three major topics. Firstly, the plant response to the mycorrhizal colonisation was analysed using both, targeted and non-targeted approaches. As an example, the localisation of the gst1 mRNA in potato mycorrhiza is shown. Second, molecular techniques were established to analyse gene expression of the fungal partner of the symbiosis. We present a differential RNA display analysis of spore germination in two AM fungi and the cloning of a gene from Glomus mosseae that shows expression at all stages of the fungal life cycle. In the last part, we introduce the work we are carrying out with a new root endophytic fungus, Piriformospora indica. Infection experiments on maize showed that despite the fungus performs as a root necrotroph, it has a positive effect on plant growth. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Franken P.; Requena N.; Bütehorn B.; Krajinski F.; Kuhn G.; Lapopin L.; Mann P.; Rhody D.; Stommel M.,NA,,NA,"Franken, Philipp (7102792218); Requena, Natalia (6603854531); Bütehorn, Britta (7801343267); Krajinski, Franziska (6603375678); Kuhn, Gerrit (58320871300); Lapopin, Laurence (6507415680); Mann, Petra (57191162109); Rhody, Daniela (6507232197); Stommel, Michaela (7003796074)",NA,Molecular analysis of the Arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis,Archives of Agronomy and Soil Science,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,,,,NA,Arbuscular mycorrhiza; Differential gene expression; Piriformospora indica,,"Franken P., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Requena N., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Bütehorn B., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Krajinski F., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Kuhn G., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Lapopin L., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Mann P., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Rhody D., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany; Stommel M., Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany","Max-Planck Institut für terrestrische Mikrobiologie, and Laboratorium fiir Mikrobiologie, Philipps-University, Marburg, 35043, Karl-von-Frisch-Strasse, Germany","P.

507,,,Both,"Fitness in tall fescue could be determined as the relative seed production by overcoming self-incompatibility barriers. This study was an attempt to investigate the effects of plant genotype and symbiotic fungal endophyte on seed production and associated traits in tall fescue. Fifteen clones of tall fescue free from endophyte and two clones with both endophyte-infected (E+) and non-infected (E-) counterparts were evaluated under two pollination systems of natural open-pollination and obligate self-pollination. Although seed yield was depressed by self-pollination in all E- genotypes, some genotypes exhibited reasonable selfing ratio. However, endophyte infection was much more effective to increase selfing ratio and seed yield through self-pollination particularly in the genotype 75B. Endophyte infection almost removed self-incompatibilty in the host plants and on average resulted in 3.0 times more number of seeds per self-pollinated seedheads than the non-counterpart E- tall fescue genotypes. Although it may need more elaborated studies, incorporating Epichloe fungal endophyte in plant genotypes not only may make the inbreeding in tall fescue possible but also may improve forage yield and seed production, simultaneously.","Zarean, M; Sabzalian, MR; Mirlohi, A; Davoudi, M; Ataii, E",NA,NA,NA,"Zarean, M.; Sabzalian, Mohammad R.; Mirlohi, A.; Davoudi, M.; Ataii, E.",NA,<i>Epichloe</i> endophyte and plant genotype determine seed production through self-pollination in tall fescue,EUPHYTICA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sabzalian, Mohammad R./E-6279-2013","Sabzalian, Mohammad R./0000-0002-7315-9990",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0014-2336,1573-5060,NA,NA,NA,NOV,2017,213,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1007/s10681-017-2037-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10681-017-2037-7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000413697900012,NA,507,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

509,,,Presence,"In a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial experiment, plants of one genotype of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) were grown in soil in pots in a glasshouse on two occasions. The treatments were either with (E+) or without (E-) infection by the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum; with (N+) or without (N-) inoculation by the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne marylandi; and with or without water deficit stress. In the first experiment, nematode numbers after 5 weeks had increased 10 times in the E-/N- watered pots and 22 times in the E-/N+ stressed plants. Root dry weight was decreased in all E-/N+ pots, compared with E-/N-. In contrast, nematode numbers in all E+/N+ pots decreased to nearly zero and root dry weight was unaffected. Osmotic adjustment in the growing zone of stressed plants was -0.35 MPa in E-/N- pots, but only -0.10 MPa in E-/N+ pots. Osmotic adjustment was greatest (-0.64 MPa) in E+ pots of both nematode treatments and almost no nematodes survived in the N+ pots. In the second experiment, there was complete nematode mortality in the E+ pots. Plant water relations were unaffected by treatments, however. It is concluded that endophyte-enhanced persistence of tall rescue in M. marylandi-infested soils that are prone to drought may be explained at least partly by endophyte protection of roots from nematode damage.

Moreover, exogenous application of ABA enhanced PAL activity and increased accumulation of flavonoids in G. biloba cells with or without fungal endophytes elicitor. These finding suggest a causal relationship between ABA release and both PAL activity and flavonoid accumulation under fungal endophytes treatment and that ABA is involved in fungal endophytes-induced flavonoids accumulation in this plant.","Hao, GP; Du, XH; Zhao, FX; Ji, HW",NA,NA,NA,"Hao, Gangping; Du, Xihua; Zhao, Faxing; Ji, Haiwei",NA,Fungal endophytes-induced abscisic acid is required for flavonoid accumulation in suspension cells of Ginkgo biloba,BIOTECHNOLOGY LETTERS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0141-5492,1573-6776,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2010,32,2,NA,NA,NA,305,314,NA,10.1007/s10529-009-0139-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-009-0139-6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19821072,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000273683000020,NA,510,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Endophyte infection had a significant positive effect on both shoot and root growth of ryegrass, but this difference was only significant in the high N supply treatment. At high N supply, endophyte-infected (EI) plants accumulated more soluble sugar in the sheath and the root than endophyte-free (EF) plants. Endophyte infection affected mineral element concentrations in the root more than in the shoot. We found a significant effect of endophyte infection on B, Mn and Mg in the root, but significant effect was only found on B in the shoot. EI plants tended to accumulate less B in the shoot at both N levels, but accumulated more B, Mn and Mg in the root at low N levels. The difference of growth parameters in different periods was significant.

516,,,Presence,"Larch sawfly, Pristiphora erichsonii Hartig, and larch needlecast fungus, Mycosphaerella laricinia (R. Hartig) Neg., are early season defoliators restricted only to Larix host trees. Larch defoliation (100%) by either the fungus or insect, but not mechanical removal, induced systemic responses that reduced sawfly consumption and digestion rates one year later. In a feeding behavior assay, larvae quickly abandoned seedlings previously defoliated by M. laricinia. Adult female oviposition choice and egg deposition were unaffected. Seedling growth was not affected during the year of defoliation by M. laricinia, but was significantly reduced one year later. Defoliation by M. laricinia reduced stem volume, radial growth, root biomass and new shoot production. The latter tissue is the only oviposition resource for larch sawfly, and, in contrast, is not influenced by sawfly feeding. We hypothesize that M. laricinia infection may limit larch sawfly populations where both species coexist. However, this reduction is at a substantial net cost to larch productivity.","KRAUSE, SC; RAFFA, KF",NA,NA,NA,"KRAUSE, SC; RAFFA, KF",NA,"COMPARISON OF INSECT, FUNGAL, AND MECHANICALLY INDUCED DEFOLIATION OF LARCH - EFFECTS ON PLANT PRODUCTIVITY AND SUBSEQUENT HOST SUSCEPTIBILITY",OECOLOGIA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0029-8549,NA,NA,NA,NA,JUN,1992,90,3,NA,NA,NA,411,416,NA,10.1007/BF00317699,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00317699,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28313529,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1992HW29400014,NA,516,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,
517,,,Both,"Tropospheric ozone is among the global change factors that pose a threat to plants and microorganisms. Symbiotic microorganisms can assist plants to cope with stress, but their role in the tolerance of plants to ozone is poorly understood. Here, we subjected endophyte-symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants of Lolium multiflorum, an annual species widely distributed in temperate grasslands, to high and low (i.e., charcoal-filtered air) ozone levels at vegetative and reproductive phases. Exposure to high ozone reduced leaf photochemical efficiency and greenness in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants. However, ozone-induced oxidative damage at biochemical level (i.e., lipid peroxidation) was mostly detected in symbiotic plants. Ozone exposure at the vegetative phase did not affect the reproductive investment in seeds, indicating full recovery from stress. Ozone exposure at the reproductive phase reduced biomass and seed production only in symbiotic plants indicating a symbiontassociated cost. At low ozone, endophyte-symbiotic plants showed a steeper slope in the relationship between seed number and seed weight (i.e., a number-weight trade-off) compared to non-symbiotic plants. However, when plants were treated at the reproductive phase, ozone increased the imbalance between seed number and seed weight in both endophyte-symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants. Plants with endophytes at the reproductive stage produced fewer seeds, which were not compensated by increased seed weight. Thus, fungal mycelium growing within ovaries or ozone-induced antioxidant systems may result in costs that finally depress the fitness of plants. Despite ozone pollution could destabilize plant-endophyte mutualisms and render them dysfunctional, other endophyte-mediated benefits (e.g., resistance to herbivory, tolerance to drought) could over-compensate these losses and explain the high incidence of the symbiosis in nature.","Ueno, AC; Gundel, PE; Ghersa, CM; Agathokleous, E; Martínez-Ghersa, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Ueno, Andrea C.; Gundel, Pedro E.; Ghersa, Claudio M.; Agathokleous, Evgenios; Alejandra Martinez-Ghersa, M.",NA,Seed-borne fungal endophytes constrain reproductive success of host plants under ozone pollution,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Agathokleous, Evgenios/D-2838-2016","Agathokleous, Evgenios/0000-0002-0058-4857",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0013-9351,1096-0953,NA,NA,NA,NOV,2021,202,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1016/j.envres.2021.111773,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111773,NA,21-Jul,NA,NA,NA,NA,34324850,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000703536100002,NA,517,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,
518,,,Both,"Plants have evolved mechanisms to survive herbivory. One such mechanism is the induction of defences upon attack that can operate intergenerationally. Cool-season grasses (sub-family Pooideae) obtain defences via symbiosis with vertically transmitted fungal endophytes (genus Epichloe) and can also show inducible responses. However, it is unknown whether these herbivore-induced responses can have intergenerational effects. We hypothesized that herbivory by aphids on maternal plants induces the intergenerational accumulation of endophyte-derived defensive alkaloids and resistance intensification in the progeny. We subjected mother plants symbiotic or not with Epichloe occultans, a species known for its production of anti-insect alkaloids known as lolines, to the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi. Then, we evaluated the progeny of these plants in terms of loline alkaloid concentration, resistance level (through herbivore performance), and shoot biomass. Herbivory on mother plants did not increase the concentration of lolines in seeds but it tended to affect loline concentration in progeny plants. There was an overall herbivore-induced intergenerational effect increasing the endophyte-conferred defence and resistance. Symbiotic plants were more resistant to aphids and had higher shoot biomass than their non-symbiotic counterparts. Since maternal herbivory did not affect the loline concentrations in seeds, the greater resistance of the progeny could have resulted from an inherited mechanism of epigenetic regulation. It would be interesting to elucidate the origin of this regulation since it could come from the host or the fungal symbiont. Thus, endophyte-driven differential fitness between symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants might be higher as generations pass on in presence of herbivores.","Bustos, LBM; Ueno, AC; Biganzoli, F; Card, SD; Mace, WJ; Martínez-Ghersa, MA; Gundel, PE",NA,NA,NA,"Bubica Bustos, Ludmila M.; Ueno, Andrea C.; Biganzoli, Fernando; Card, Stuart D.; Mace, Wade J.; Martinez-Ghersa, Maria A.; Gundel, Pedro E.",NA,Can Aphid Herbivory Induce Intergenerational Effects of Endophyte-conferred Resistance in Grasses?,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013","Card, Stuart/0000-0001-7140-7471; Biganzoli, Fernando/0000-0003-0004-5295; Ueno, Andrea/0000-0002-7853-5270",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0098-0331,1573-1561,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2022,48,12-Nov,NA,NA,NA,867,881,NA,10.1007/s10886-022-01390-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-022-01390-2,NA,22-Nov,NA,NA,NA,NA,36372818,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000882843500001,NA,518,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These endophytes produce the toxin swainsonine, which causes a neurological syndrome (locosim) when the plant is ingested by grazing animals. Here we characterize the growth of the endophytes within plant tissues using confocal and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to define the physical relationship. Microscopy results revealed the endophyte distribution to be densely networked, with the mycelia aligned parallel to the long axis of the plant stem and with no pathology to plant cell walls, xylem, or phloem. The autofluorescent mycelia were located intercellulary in the pith of stems. Stereofluoroscope observations of Alternaria oxytropis, A. cinerea, and A. fulva in phytoagar showed that mycelial growth occurred at the tip of hyphae. The growth rate of A. cinerea was significantly faster than for A. oxytropis or A. fulva. All three species of endophytes grew significantly faster at 3 days age of culture and grew slowly or not at all after 20 or 30 days.

We asked whether novel endophyte or common toxic endophyte-infected (NE+; CTE+) tall fescue affects symbiotic and non-symbiotic BNF, and utilization of biologically-fixed nitrogen in tall fescue. Tall fescue was planted either endophyte-free (E-), infected with CTE, two non-toxic strains AR542 NE, AR584 NE, or a blend of endophyte treatments. We measured natural abundance of (15) N in plant and soil samples, and conducted soil acetylene reduction assays. Endophyte presence and strain significantly affected the delta N-15 of tall fescue. Near red clover, CTE+ and AR584 NE+ tall fescue were most (15) N-depleted; but away, E- tall fescue was most (15) N-depleted. Endophyte strain significantly influenced N concentration in red clover, but not symbiotic or non-symbiotic BNF. Endophyte strains produce different effects on tall fescue's competitive ability and nitrogen utilization.

Importantly, red alder is also considered a bioindicator for ozone pollution and, like all plants, harbors a diverse endophyte community that may interact with aerial pollutants. In this study, we surveyed foliar fungal endophyte communities (microfungi) in red alder leaves from the metropolitan area of Portland, Oregon, USA, using culture-based techniques, and found that communities differed significantly by site. Our results suggest that the fungal endophyte community composition in red alder leaves may be influenced in part by local air pollution sources, likely in conjunction with other site characteristics. As urban areas expand, more studies should focus on how the urban environment affects plant-microbe community ecology and endophyte-host interactions, as well as on the long-term consequences for other ecosystem processes such as leaf litter decomposition.","Wolfe, ER; Kautz, S; Singleton, SL; Ballhorn, DJ",NA,NA,NA,"Wolfe, Emily R.; Kautz, Stefanie; Singleton, Sebastian L.; Ballhorn, Daniel J.",NA,Differences in foliar endophyte communities of red alder (<i>Alnus rubra</i>) exposed to varying air pollutant levels,BOTANY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wolfe, Emily/0000-0003-1808-7012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1916-2790,1916-2804,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2018,96,12,NA,NA,NA,825,835,NA,10.1139/cjb-2018-0085,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2018-0085,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000451221000002,NA,522,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

524,,,Presence,"The true myrtle, Myrtus communis, is a small perennial evergreen tree that occurs in Europe, Africa, and Asia with a circum-Mediterranean geographic distribution. Unfortunately, the Mediterranean Forests, where M. communis occurs, are critically endangered and are currently restricted to small fragmented areas in protected conservation units. In the present work, we performed, for the first time, a metabarcoding study on the spatial variation of fungal community structure in the foliar endophytome of this endemic plant of the Mediterranean biome, using bipartite network analysis as a model. The local bipartite network of Myrtus communis individuals and their foliar endophytic fungi is very low connected, with low nestedness, and moderately high specialization and modularity. Similar network patterns were also retrieved in both culture-dependent and amplicon metagenomics of foliar endophytes in distinct arboreal hosts in varied biomes. Furthermore, the majority of putative fungal endophytes species were basidiomycete woody saprotrophs of the orders Polyporales, Agaricales, and Hymenochaetales. Altogether, these findings suggest a possible adaptation of these wood-decaying fungi to cope with moisture limitation and spatial scarcity of their primary substrate (dead wood), which are totally consistent with the predictions of the viaphytism hypothesis that wood-decomposing fungi inhabit the internal leaf tissue of forest trees in order to enhance dispersal to substrates on the forest floor, by using leaves as vectors and as refugia, during periods of environmental stress.","Vaz, ABM; Fonseca, PLC; Silva, FF; Quintanilha-Peixoto, G; Sampedro, I; Siles, JA; Carmo, A; Kato, RB; Azevedo, V; Badotti, F; Ocampo, JA; Rosa, CA; Góes-Neto, A",NA,NA,NA,"Vaz, Aline Bruna M.; Fonseca, Paula Luize C.; Silva, Felipe F.; Quintanilha-Peixoto, Gabriel; Sampedro, Inmaculada; Siles, Jose A.; Carmo, Anderson; Kato, Rodrigo B.; Azevedo, Vasco; Badotti, Fernanda; Ocampo, Juan A.; Rosa, Carlos A.; Goes-Neto, Aristoteles",NA,Foliar mycoendophytome of an endemic plant of the Mediterranean biome <i>(Myrtus communis</i>) reveals the dominance of basidiomycete woody saprotrophs,PEERJ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ocampo, Juan/K-7565-2014; Vaz, Aline/F-7684-2012; Carmo, Anderson/E-6427-2016; Goes-Neto, Aristoteles/A-6955-2013; Fonseca, Paula/AAL-8690-2020; Azevedo, Vasco/B-1556-2019; vasco, azevedo/F-4315-2011; Badotti, Fernanda/G-8556-2017; Kato, Rodrigo/Q-2242-2017; Siles, Jose A./A-7043-2019","Oliveira do Carmo, Anderson/0000-0003-4646-513X; Rosa, Carlos/0000-0002-0056-9075; Quintanilha-Peixoto, Gabriel/0000-0002-7476-5845; vasco, azevedo/0000-0002-4775-2280; Badotti, Fernanda/0000-0001-9038-4631; Kato, Rodrigo/0000-0002-9046-1702; Vaz, Aline/0000-0002-3167-6308; Fonseca, Paula/0000-0002-8103-9235; Siles, Jose A./0000-0002-5850-0281",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2167-8359,NA,NA,NA,NA,3-Dec,2020,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.7717/peerj.10487,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10487,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33344092,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000595237000007,NA,524,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed a multiplex metabarcoding method for the identification of fungal phytopathogens and endophytes in olive young shoots, using the MinION sequencing platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Selected fungal-specific primers were used to amplify three different genomic DNA loci (ITS, beta-tubulin, and 28S LSU) originating from olive twigs. A multiplex metabarcoding approach was initially evaluated using healthy olive twigs, and further assessed with naturally infected olive twig samples. Bioinformatic analysis of basecalled reads was carried out using MinKNOW, BLAST+ and R programming, and results were also evaluated using the BugSeq cloud platform. Data analysis highlighted the approaches based on ITS and their combination with beta-tubulin as the most informative ones according to diversity estimations.

527,,,Review,"Molecular phylogeny has resolved the liverworts as the earliest-divergent clade of land plants and mosses as the sister group to hornworts plus tracheophytes, with alternative topologies resolving the hornworts as sister to mosses plus tracheophytes less well supported. The tracheophytes plus fossil plants putatively lacking lignified vascular tissue form the polysporangiophyte clade. This paper reviews phylogenetic, developmental, anatomical, genetic and paleontological data with the aim of reconstructing the succession of events that shaped major land plant lineages. Fundamental land plant characters primarily evolved in the bryophyte grade, and hence the key to a better understanding of the early evolution of land plants is in bryophytes. The last common ancestor of land plants was probably a leafless axial gametophyte bearing simple unisporangiate sporophytes. Water-conducting tissue, if present, was restricted to the gametophyte and presumably consisted of perforate cells similar to those in the early-divergent bryophytes Haplomitrium and Takakia. Stomata were a sporophyte innovation with the possible ancestral functions of producing a transpiration-driven flow of water and solutes from the parental gametophyte and facilitating spore separation before release. Stomata in mosses, hornworts and polysporangiophytes are viewed as homologous, and hence these three lineages are collectively referred to as the ostomatophytes'. An indeterminate sporophyte body (the sporophyte shoot) developing from an apical meristem was the key innovation in polysporangiophytes. Poikilohydry is the ancestral condition in land plants; homoiohydry evolved in the sporophyte of polysporangiophytes. Fungal symbiotic associations ancestral to modern arbuscular mycorrhizas evolved in the gametophytic generation before the separation of major present-living lineages. Hydroids are imperforate water-conducting cells specific to advanced mosses. Xylem vascular cells in polysporangiophytes arose either from perforate cells or de novo. Food-conducting cells were a very early innovation in land plant evolution. The inferences presented here await testing by molecular genetics.","Ligrone, R; Duckett, JG; Renzaglia, KS",NA,NA,NA,"Ligrone, Roberto; Duckett, Jeffrey G.; Renzaglia, Karen S.",NA,Major transitions in the evolution of early land plants: a bryological perspective,ANNALS OF BOTANY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ligrone, Roberto/GVU-6415-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0305-7364,1095-8290,NA,NA,NA,APR,2012,109,5,NA,NA,NA,851,871,NA,10.1093/aob/mcs017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcs017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,22356739,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000301971900005,NA,527,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

530,,,Presence,"Orchids are critically dependent on fungi for seedling establishment and growth, so the distribution and diversity of orchids might depend on the associated fungal communities. We characterised the communities associated with eight orchid species in three Mediterranean protected areas, using a combination of above-ground analyses of sporophores and below-ground molecular analyses of orchid root samples. In three years of sporophore collection in 25 plots around flowering orchid plants, 268 macrofungal species belonging to 84 genera were observed. Statistical analyses indicated a correlation between macrofungal diversity and orchid community variation, regardless of the effect of environmental and spatial factors characterizing the investigated orchid sites. Fungal ITS-DNA PCR amplification, cloning, and sequencing revealed Rhizoctonia-like fungi belonging to Ceratobasidiaceae (26 %), Tulasnellaceae (22.5 %), and Sebacinaceae (3.5 %), as well as other basidiomycetes and ascomycetes, in the roots of 99 orchid plants. Mycorrhizal specificity was low but co-occurring orchid species showed preferences for diffeent partners. The diverse macrofungal communities found in the sites may contribute to orchid community variation without colonizing the orchid roots. Molecular analyses revealed a segregation of associated fungi, which may contribute to Mediterranean orchid coexistence in nature. © 2018 International Mycological Association.",Pecoraro L.; Caruso T.; Cai L.; Gupta V.K.; Liu Z.-J.,NA,,NA,"Pecoraro, Lorenzo (54898762400); Caruso, Tancredi (7003382204); Cai, Lei (55653935100); Gupta, Vijai Kumar (36158104300); Liu, Zhong-Jian (56101469900)",NA,Fungal networks and orchid distribution: New insights from above- and below-ground analyses of fungal communities,IMA Fungus,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,,,,NA,Endophytic fungi; Macrofungal communities; Mediterranean; Molecular ecology; Mycorrhizas; Orchid-fungus relationships; Spatial distributionSpecies coexistence,,"Pecoraro L., Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Orchid Conservation and Utilization, The National Orchid Conservation Center of China and The Orchid Conservation and Research Center of Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518114, China, Center for Biotechnology and oBioMedicine and Division of Life and Health Sciences, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, 518055, China, State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; Caruso T., School of Biological Sciences, Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland, BT9 7BL, United Kingdom; Cai L., State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; Gupta V.K., Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, ERA Chair of Green Chemistry, School of Science, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, 12618, Estonia; Liu Z.-J., Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Orchid Conservation and Utilization, The National Orchid Conservation Center of China and The Orchid Conservation and Research Center of Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518114, China","Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Orchid Conservation and Utilization, The National Orchid Conservation Center of China and The Orchid Conservation and Research Center of Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518114, China; Center for Biotechnology and oBioMedicine and Division of Life and Health Sciences, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, 518055, China; State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; School of Biological Sciences, Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland, BT9 7BL, United Kingdom; Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, ERA Chair of Green Chemistry, School of Science, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, 12618, Estonia","L.

531,,,Presence,"Many wild and cultivated cool-season grass species are naturally infected with fungal endophytes of the genera Neotyphodium and Epichloë. These associations generally are considered mutualistic with the plants benefiting from reduced herbivory and the fungi benefiting from nutrients supplied by the plants. The fungi secrete proteins that might have a role in the interspecies symbiosis. In the interaction between Poa ampla Merr. and the endophyte Neotyphodium sp., a fungal chitinase was detected in the apoplastic protein fraction. The chitinase was also the major protein secreted in culture. Sequence analysis of the chitinase revealed it has a low level of amino acid sequence identity to other fungal chitinases and one of the conserved active site residues is altered. DNA gel-blot analysis indicated the chitinase was encoded by a single gene. Expression of similar chitinases also was detected in endophyte-infected tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and Chewings fescue (Festuca rubra L. subsp. fallax [Thuill] Nyman).

532,,,Presence,"Fungal endophytes are diverse and widespread symbionts that occur in the living tissues of all lineages of plants without causing evidence of disease. Culture-based and culture-free studies indicate that they often are abundant in the leaves of woody angiosperms, but only a few studies have visualized endophytic fungi in leaf tissues, and the process through which most endophytes colonize leaves has not been studied thoroughly. We inoculated leaf discs and the living leaves of a model woody angiosperm, Populus trichocarpa, which has endophytes that represent three distantly-related genera (Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Trichoderma). We used scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy to evaluate the timeline and processes by which they colonize leaf tissue. Under laboratory conditions with high humidity, conidia germinated on leaf discs to yield hyphae that grew epiphytically and incidentally entered stomata, but did not grow in a directed fashion toward stomatal openings. No cuticular penetration was observed. The endophytes readily colonized the interiors of leaf discs that were detached from living leaves, and could be visualized within discs with light microscopy. Although they were difficult to visualize within the interior of living leaves following in vivo inoculations, standard methods for isolating foliar endophytes confirmed their presence.","Huang, YL; Zimmerman, NB; Arnold, AE",NA,NA,NA,"Huang, Yu-Ling; Zimmerman, Naupaka B.; Arnold, A.

533,,,Other,"Cadmium (Cd) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) are frequently detected in agricultural soils, which poses a threat to public health. This study investigated the effects of inoculation of king grass with Piriformospora indica on the remediation of soils co-contaminated with Cd and DDTs. After treatment for 90 days, the dry shoot and root biomass of king grass inoculated with P. indica markedly increased by 13.0-15.8% and 24.1-46.4%, respectively, compared with those of uninoculated plants. Inoculation with P. indica also increased the uptake of Cd and DDTs by shoots and roots of king grass. The removal efficiency of Cd and DDTs from soils reached 4.88-17.4% and 48.4-51.0%, respectively, in the presence of king grass inoculated with P. indica. Under three Cd-DDTs contamination conditions, root secretion of organic acids, alcohol, and polyamines was distinctively stimulated by P. indica inoculation of king grass compared with planting king grass alone. After phytor-emediation, changes in soil bacterial and fungal community composition occurred at different contamination levels. Overall, the results showed that king grass associated with P. indica can be adopted for phytoextraction of Cd and DDTs from moderately contaminated soils by regulating root excretion and reshaping rhizosphere mi-crobial community structure.","Li, D; Zheng, XX; Lin, L; An, QL; Jiao, YQ; Li, QL; Li, ZD; Hong, Y; Zhang, KL; Xie, C; Yin, J; Zhang, HX; Wang, BJ; Hu, YM; Zhu, ZQ",NA,NA,NA,"Li, Dong; Zheng, Xiaoxiao; Lin, Li; An, Qianli; Jiao, Yangqiu; Li, Qiuli; Li, Zhidong; Hong, Yi; Zhang, Kailu; Xie, Can; Yin, Jing; Zhang, Haixiang; Wang, Baijie; Hu, Yueming; Zhu, Zhiqiang",NA,Remediation of soils co-contaminated with cadmium and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes by king grass associated with<i> Piriformospora</i><i> indica:</i> Insights into the regulation of root excretion and reshaping of rhizosphere microbial community structure,JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"lin, lirong/C-1953-2008; An, Qianli/D-5321-2015",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0304-3894,1873-3336,NA,NA,NA,15-Jan,2022,422,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126936,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126936,NA,21-Aug,NA,NA,NA,NA,34463272,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000709306900001,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Makino, an apomictic grass distributed along the coasts of Taiwan and Ryukyu Islands. A total of 250 plants from three Taiwanese populations (Southeast Coast, Orchid Islet, and Green Islet) and two populations from Ryukyu (Ishigaki and Amami-O-Shima Islets) were sampled. The amplified products of 40 random primers showed monomorphic banding patterns within all populations as well as among the three populations from Taiwan. Low genetic variation (with only two polymorphic loci), but significant differentiation, was detected between populations from Taiwan and Ryukyu (φCT = 0.864) and between populations (φST= 1.0) from lshigaki and Amami-O-Shima Islets. In contrast, a high level of variation was exhibited in the outcrossing Miscanthus sinensis var. glaber (Nakai) Li. In addition to apomictic reproduction, low genetic variation across populations of M. sinensis var. condensatus may be a result of high salinity acting as a selective agent. With the cost of reduced genetic heterogeneity, apomixis may have provided a mechanism for avoiding the transmission of endophytic fungi.

537,,,Other,"Air pollution caused by tropospheric ozone contributes to the decline of forest ecosystems; for instance, sacred fir, Abies religiosa (Kunth) Schltdl. & Cham. forests in the peri-urban region of Mexico City. Individual trees within these forests exhibit variation in their response to ozone exposure, including the severity of visible symptoms in needles. Using RNA-Seq metatranscriptomic data and ITS2 metabarcoding, we investigated whether symptom variation correlates with the taxonomic and functional composition of fungal mycobiomes from needles collected in this highly polluted area in the surroundings of Mexico City. Our findings indicate that ozone-related symptoms do not significantly correlate with changes in the taxonomic composition of fungal mycobiomes. However, genes coding for 30 putative proteins were differentially expressed in the mycobiome of asymptomatic needles, including eight genes previously associated with resistance to oxidative stress. These results suggest that fungal communities likely play a role in mitigating the oxidative burst caused by tropospheric ozone in sacred fir. Our study illustrates the feasibility of using RNA-Seq data, accessible from global sequence repositories, for the characterization of fungal communities associated with plant tissues, including their gene expression.","Flores-Almaraz, VS; Truong, C; Hernández-Oaxaca, D; Reyes-Galindo, V; Mastretta-Yanes, A; Jaramillo-Correa, JP; Salas-Lizana, R",NA,NA,NA,"Flores-Almaraz, Valeria Stephany; Truong, Camille; Hernandez-Oaxaca, Diana; Reyes-Galindo, Veronica; Mastretta-Yanes, Alicia; Jaramillo-Correa, Juan Pablo; Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo",NA,Foliar mycobiome remains unaltered under urban air-pollution but differentially express stress-related genes,MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mastretta, Alicia/KTI-1558-2024; Truong, Camille/R-7670-2019; Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo/LCL-2439-2024","Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo/0000-0002-0761-2910; Reyes-Galindo, Veronica/0000-0003-0688-2203; Mastretta-Yanes, Alicia/0000-0003-2951-6353; Jaramillo-Correa, Juan P./0000-0001-7617-913X; Hernandez Oaxaca, Diana/0000-0001-6218-8297; Truong, Camille/0000-0002-8510-1761; Flores Almaraz, Valeria/0009-0003-8601-8462",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0095-3628,1432-184X,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2024,87,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1007/s00248-024-02387-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-024-02387-y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38755460,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001227211200001,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wheat (Triticum aestivum) leaves were sprayed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and then subjected to physical and chemical surface treatments. The fungal ITS1 products were amplified from whole tissue DNA extractions. ANOVA was performed on the DNA bands representing S. cerevisiae on the agarose gel. Band profile comparisons using permutational multivariate ANOVA (PERMANOVA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) were performed on DGGE gel data, and band numbers were compared between treatments. Leaf surfaces were viewed under variable pressure scanning electron microscopy (VPSEM). Yeast band analysis of the agarose gel showed that there was no significant difference in the mean band DNA quantity after physical and chemical treatments, but they both differed significantly (p < 0.05) from the untreated control. PERMANOVA revealed a significant difference between all treatments (p < 0.05). The mean similarity matrix showed that the physical treatment results were more reproducible than those from the chemical treatment results. The NMDS showed that the physical treatment was the most consistent. VPSEM indicated that the physical treatment was the most effective treatment to remove surface microbes and debris. The use of molecular and microscopy methods for the post-treatment detection of yeast inoculated onto wheat leaf surfaces demonstrated the effectiveness of the surface treatment employed, and this can assist researchers in optimizing their surface sterilization techniques in DNA-based fungal endophyte studies. © 2014, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.",Burgdorf R.J.; Laing M.D.; Morris C.D.; Jamal-Ally S.F.,NA,,NA,"Burgdorf, R.J.

539,,,Other,"Considering the potential threat of vegetables growing in antibiotic-polluted soil with high abundance of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) against human health through the food chain, it is thus urgent to develop novel control technology to ensure vegetable safety. In the present work, pot experiments were conducted in lettuce cultivation to assess the impedance effect of biochar amendment on soil sulfonamides (SAs), antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), and ARG enrichment in lettuce tissues. After 100 days of cultivation, lettuce cultivation with biochar amendment exhibited the greatest soil SA dissipation as well as the significant improvement of lettuce growth indices, with residual soil SAs mainly existing as the tightly bound fraction. Moreover, the SA contents in roots and new/old leaves were reduced by one to two orders of magnitude compared to those without biochar amendment. In addition, isolate counts for SA-resistant bacterial endophytes in old leaves and sul gene abundances in roots and old leaves also decreased significantly after biochar application. However, neither SA resistant bacteria nor sul genes were detected in new leaves. It was the first study to demonstrate that biochar amendment can be a practical strategy to protect lettuce safety growing in SA-polluted soil with rich ARB and ARGs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Ye M.; Sun M.; Feng Y.; Wan J.; Xie S.; Tian D.; Zhao Y.; Wu J.; Hu F.; Li H.; Jiang X.,NA,,NA,"Ye, Mao (57200130221); Sun, Mingming (36088000900); Feng, Yanfang (54386661100); Wan, Jinzhong (16319864300); Xie, Shanni (56927338200); Tian, Da (56717191800); Zhao, Yu (59050815500); Wu, Jun (57203272581); Hu, Feng (7202526324); Li, Huixin (8542795700); Jiang, Xin (57214068210)",NA,"Effect of biochar amendment on the control of soil sulfonamides, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and gene enrichment in lettuce tissues",Journal of Hazardous Materials,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,,,,NA,ARB; ARGs; Biochar addition; Impedance effect; Lettuce cultivation,"Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Charcoal; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Food Contamination; Genes, Bacterial; Lettuce; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants; Sulfonamides; Bacteria (microorganisms); Lactuca; Amides; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Bacteriology; Cultivation; Genes; Health risks; Histology; Soil pollution; Sulfur compounds; Tissue; Vegetables; biochar; charcoal; RNA 16S; sulfonamide; unclassified drug; vegetable protein; antiinfective agent; bacterial RNA; biochar; charcoal; soil pollutant; sulfonamide; Antibiotic-resistant bacteria; Antibiotic-resistant genes; ARGs; Bacterial endophytes; Bio chars; Control technologies; Orders of magnitude; Resistant bacteria; antibiotic resistance; bacterium; charcoal; cultivation; drug; gene; growth rate; leaf; leafy vegetable; residual soil; root system; soil amendment; antibiotic resistant bacteria; antibiotic resistant gene; Article; bacterial gene; bioaccumulation; bound fraction; chemical composition; chlorophyll content; concentration (parameters); controlled study; dry weight; endophyte; endophytic fungus; fresh weight; gene dosage; genetic analysis; lettuce; nonhuman; plant growth; plant leaf; plant root; plant tissue; root growth; soil amendment; soil property; surface area; antibiotic resistance; bacterial gene; bacterium; chemistry; food contamination; genetics; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; prevention and control; soil pollutant; Soils","Ye M., State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, China; Sun M., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Feng Y., Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, 210014, China; Wan J., Nanjing Institute of Environmental Science, Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, Nanjing, 210042, China; Xie S., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Tian D., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Zhao Y., Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Photonic and Electronic Materials, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China; Wu J., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Hu F., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Li H., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Jiang X., State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, China","State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, China; Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, 210014, China; Nanjing Institute of Environmental Science, Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, Nanjing, 210042, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Photonic and Electronic Materials, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China","Y.

541,,,Other,"Neotyphodium endophytic fungi, the asexual state of Epichloe species, protect cool-season grasses against stresses. The outcomes of Neotyphodium-grass symbioses are agronomically relevant as they may affect the productivity of pastures. It has been suggested that the mutualism is characteristic of agronomic grasses and that differential rates of gene flow between both partners' populations are expected to disrupt the specificity of the association and, thus, the mutualism in wild grasses. We propose that compatibility is necessary but not sufficient to explain the outcomes of Neotyphodium-grass symbiosis, and advance a model that links genetic compatibility, mutualism effectiveness, and endophyte transmission efficiency. For endophytes that reproduce clonally and depend on allogamous hosts for reproduction and dissemination, we propose that this symbiosis works as an integrated entity where gene flow promotes its fitness and evolution. Compatibility between the host plant and the fungal endophyte would be high in genetically close parents; however, mutualism effectiveness and transmission efficiency would be low in fitness depressed host plants. Increasing the genetic distance of mating parents would increase mutualism effectiveness and transmission efficiency. This tendency would be broken when the genetic distance between parents is high (out-breeding depression). Our model allows for testable hypotheses that would contribute to understand the coevolutionary origin and future of the endophyte-grass mutualism.","Gundel, PE; Omacini, M; Sadras, VO; Ghersa, CM",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro E.; Omacini, Marina; Sadras, Victor O.; Ghersa, Claudio M.",NA,The interplay between the effectiveness of the grass-endophyte mutualism and the genetic variability of the host plant,EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Sadras, Victor/D-5122-2013","Sadras, Victor/0000-0002-5874-6775; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Omacini, Marina/0000-0003-1460-262X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1752-4571,NA,NA,NA,NA,SEP,2010,3,6-May,NA,NA,NA,538,546,NA,10.1111/j.1752-4571.2010.00152.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-4571.2010.00152.x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25567945,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000281311700012,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe the first reference genome for P. australis and compare invasive (ssp. australis) and native (ssp. americanus) genotypes collected from replicated populations across the Laurentian Great Lakes to deduce genomic bases driving its invasive success. Here, we report novel genomic features including a Phragmites lineage-specific whole genome duplication, followed by gene loss and preferential retention of genes associated with transcription factors and regulatory functions in the remaining duplicates. Comparative transcriptomic analyses revealed that genes associated with biotic stress and defence responses were expressed at a higher basal level in invasive genotypes, but native genotypes showed a stronger induction of defence responses when challenged by a fungal endophyte. The reference genome and transcriptomes, combined with previous ecological and environmental data, add to our understanding of mechanisms leading to invasiveness and support the development of novel, genomics-assisted management approaches for invasive Phragmites.","Oh, DH; Kowalski, KP; Quach, QN; Wijesinghege, C; Tanford, P; Dassanayake, M; Clay, K",NA,NA,NA,"Oh, Dong-Ha; Kowalski, Kurt P.; Quach, Quynh N.; Wijesinghege, Chathura; Tanford, Philippa; Dassanayake, Maheshi; Clay, Keith",NA,Novel genome characteristics contribute to the invasiveness of <i>Phragmites australis</i> (common reed),MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kowalski, Kurt/GXZ-5008-2022; Dassanayake, Maheshi/B-7331-2012; Oh, Dong-Ha/O-7591-2019","Dassanayake, Maheshi/0000-0003-3123-3731; Quach, Quynh/0000-0001-6504-6358; Kowalski, Kurt/0000-0002-8424-4701; Oh, Dong-Ha/0000-0003-1526-9814",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0962-1083,1365-294X,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2022,31,4,NA,NA,NA,1142,1159,NA,10.1111/mec.16293,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mec.16293,NA,21-Dec,NA,NA,NA,NA,34839548,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000729123600001,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,,,Both,"We present a review of the documented fungal colonizations of presumably symbiotic nature in lycophytes and ferns (""pteridophytes""). The sampling covers ca. 11 % (1287 spp.) of the estimated global diversity of these taxa (ca. 12,000 spp.) and shows an average presence of fungal endophytes of 68 %, which is significantly lower than the average presence of mycorrhiza of 80-85 % for the remaining tracheophytes. Above-average colonization rates up to 100 % among ferns are mainly found in phylogenetically old lineages, whereas below-average mycorrhization characterizes the Polypod I clade and the Aspleniaceae of the derived leptosporangiate ferns. Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) are found in 54 % of the species, to which 6 % of unspecified records of mycorrhizae should probably be added. Dark Septate Endophytes (DSE) are found in 13 % of the species, in about half the cases (6 %) together with AMF. Ectomycorrhizae have not been confirmed for pteridophytes so far, and basidiomycetes are found very rarely in mycoheterotropic gametophytes. Fungal endophytes are unevenly distributed across the life forms and most frequent with 75 % in the terrestrial species, followed with 69 % in saxicolous and with 58 % in epiphytic species. Although AMF have a low dispersal potential and thus are considered unreliable symbiotic partners for epiphytes, they are still present in 27 % of the investigated epiphytic pteridophytes. The occurrence of mycorrhizae across the taxa of pteridophytes bears a phylogenetic signal, as the derived ferns show a notable trend towards a growing independence from AM, in epiphytes more pronouncedly so than in terrestrial taxa.","Lehnert, M; Krug, M; Kessler, M",NA,NA,NA,"Lehnert, Marcus; Krug, Michael; Kessler, Michael",NA,A review of symbiotic fungal endophytes in lycophytes and ferns - a global phylogenetic and ecological perspective,SYMBIOSIS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kessler, Michael/A-3605-2009; Lehnert, Marcus/F-3288-2011","Kessler, Michael/0000-0003-4612-9937; Lehnert, Marcus/0000-0002-7202-7734",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0334-5114,1878-7665,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2017,71,2,NA,NA,NA,77,89,NA,10.1007/s13199-016-0436-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-016-0436-5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000395022600001,NA,9410,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,,,Presence,"Poplars are among the few tree genera that can develop both ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular (AM) associations; however, variable ratios of ECM/AM in dual mycorrhizal colonizations were observed in the roots of a variety of poplar species and hybrids. The objective of our study was to analyze the effect of internal and external factors on growth and dual AM and ECM colonization of poplar roots in three 12-15-year-old common gardens in Poland. We also analyzed the abundance of nonmycorrhizal fungal endophytes in the poplar roots. The Populus clones comprised black poplars (Populus deltoides and P. deltoides × Populus nigra), balsam poplars (Populus maximowiczii × Populus trichocarpa), and a hybrid of black and balsam poplars (P. deltoides × P. trichocarpa). Of the three sites that we studied, one was located in the vicinity of a copper smelter, where soil was contaminated with copper and lead. Poplar root tip abundance, mycorrhizal colonization, and soil fungi biomass were lower at this heavily polluted site. The total mycorrhizal colonization and the ratio of ECM and AM colonization differed among the study sites and according to soil depth. The influence of Populus genotype was significantly pronounced only within the individual study sites. The contribution of nonmycorrhizal fungal endophytes differed among the poplar clones and was higher at the polluted site than at the sites free of pollution. Our results indicate that poplar fine root abundance and AM and ECM symbiosis are influenced by environmental conditions. Further studies of different site conditions are required to characterize the utility of poplars for purposes such as the phytoremediation of polluted sites. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Karliński L.; Rudawska M.; Kieliszewska-Rokicka B.; Leski T.,NA,,NA,"Karliński, Leszek (6508173301); Rudawska, Maria (6603419545); Kieliszewska-Rokicka, Barbara (6603177644); Leski, Tomasz (35409524100)",NA,Relationship between genotype and soil environment during colonization of poplar roots by mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi,Mycorrhiza,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,,,,NA,Arbuscular mycorrhiza; Depth distribution; Ectomycorrhiza; Fine-root colonization; Heavy metals; Populus,"Biomass; Copper; Fungi; Genotype; Lead; Plant Roots; Poland; Populus; Soil; Soil Pollutants; Symbiosis; Poland; Arbuscular; Fungi; Populus; Populus balsamifera; Populus deltoides; Populus maximowiczii; Populus nigra; Populus trichocarpa; copper; lead; abundance; arbuscular mycorrhiza; dicotyledon; ectomycorrhiza; endophyte; fine root; genotype-environment interaction; growth rate; heavy metal; phytoremediation; root colonization; vertical distribution; article; aspen; biomass; fungus; genotype; growth, development and aging; microbiology; physiology; plant root; Poland; soil; soil pollutant; symbiosis","Karliński L., Institute of Dendrology Polish Academy of Sciences, 62-035 Kórnik, Parkowa 5, Poland; Rudawska M., Institute of Dendrology Polish Academy of Sciences, 62-035 Kórnik, Parkowa 5, Poland; Kieliszewska-Rokicka B., Institute of Dendrology Polish Academy of Sciences, 62-035 Kórnik, Parkowa 5, Poland; Leski T., Institute of Dendrology Polish Academy of Sciences, 62-035 Kórnik, Parkowa 5, Poland","Institute of Dendrology Polish Academy of Sciences, 62-035 Kórnik, Parkowa 5, Poland","L.

3,,,Presence,"Ascomycetes from the genus Claviceps are long-known pathogens of plants, including cereals. Despite of this, no effective fungicide has been developed yet. We checked whether the presence of ergot impacts the size and composition of the mycobiota in rye seeds (Secale cereale). The sizes of spikes and seeds were also checked. To identify endophytes, the fungal isolates were analyzed using molecular markers ITS1 and ITS2. We found nine taxa of fungal endophytes in the studied rye seeds. The most abundantly represented fungus, regardless of ergot presence, was Alternaria infectoria. Seeds from the spikes with and without ergot differed in the presence of two fungal species: Microdochium nivale occurred only in the seeds of spikes with ergot, while Pyrenophora teres only in the seeds of spikes without ergot. No effect of ergot presence in rye spikes on seed size was found. The lack of differences in the size and taxonomical composition of mycobiota and seed size between plants with and without ergot confirms the hypothesis on the benefits of this dangerous for humans pathogen for plants. © 2022.

5,,,Presence,"Locoweeds including the toxic species of Astragalus spp and Oxytropis spp. are widely distributed in the western region of China and result in a chronic neurological disease known as locoism in animals. To determine the presence of swainsonine-producing fungal endophyte of major locoweed species in China, endophytes were isolated from 8 locoweed species that including A. variabilis, A. strictus, O. glacialis, O. kansuensis, O. ochrocepala, O. sericopetala, O. glabra and O. latibracteata. Seven species of locoweed were confirmed contain substantial amounts of swainsonine and infect swainsonine-producing fungal endophyte. These endophytes were classified as Undifilim oxytropis according to the fungal morphology and phylogenetic analysis based on sufficient ITS sequences. PCR-RFLP analysis of IGS region showed that the interspecific or intraspecific variations were present among the endophytes from different locoweed species. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Yu Y.; Zhao Q.; Wang J.; Wang J.; Wang Y.; Song Y.; Geng G.; Li Q.,NA,,NA,"Yu, Yongtao (56143719000); Zhao, Qingmei (55479212000); Wang, Jianna (35811530400); Wang, Jianhua (56086643600); Wang, Yan (36775570600); Song, Yumin (55494072900); Geng, Guoxia (14044863800); Li, Qinfan (35810725200)",NA,Swainsonine-producing fungal endophytes from major locoweed species in China,Toxicon,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,,,,NA,Fungal endophyte; Intergenic sequence; Locoweed; Swainsonine; Undifilim oxytropis,"Base Sequence; China; Chromatography, Gas; DNA Primers; Fungi; Oxytropis; Phylogeny; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Species Specificity; Swainsonine; Animalia; Astragalus (angiosperm); Oxytropis; Oxytropis sericopetala; fungal DNA; internal transcribed spacer; spacer DNA; swainsonine; article; Astragalus plant; Astragalus strictus; Astragalus variabilis; China; controlled study; endophyte; fungal metabolism; fungal morphology; fungal plant disease; fungus isolation; gene amplification; higher plant; locoweed; molecular phylogeny; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Oxytropis; Oxytropis glabra; Oxytropis glacialis; Oxytropis kansuensis; Oxytropis latibracteata; Oxytropis ochrocepala; Oxytropis sericopetala; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; restriction fragment length polymorphism; sequence analysis; species difference; toxin analysis; toxin synthesis; Undifilim oxytropis","Yu Y., College of Animal Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A and F University, Yangling 712100, China, College of Agronomy Ningxia University, Yinchuan 750021, China; Zhao Q., College of Life Sciences and Engineering, North University for Nationalities, Yinchuan 750021, China; Wang J., Hosptial of Northwest A and F University, Yangling 712100, China; Wang J., College of Animal Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A and F University, Yangling 712100, China; Wang Y., College of Animal Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A and F University, Yangling 712100, China; Song Y., College of Animal Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A and F University, Yangling 712100, China; Geng G., College of Animal Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A and F University, Yangling 712100, China; Li Q., College of Animal Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A and F University, Yangling 712100, China","College of Animal Veterinary Medicine, Northwest A and F University, Yangling 712100, China; Hosptial of Northwest A and F University, Yangling 712100, China; College of Agronomy Ningxia University, Yinchuan 750021, China; College of Life Sciences and Engineering, North University for Nationalities, Yinchuan 750021, China","J.

6,,,Presence,"Bark beetles form symbiotic associations with multiple species of fungi that supplement their metabolic needs. However, the relative contributions of each symbiont to the nutrition of bark beetles have been largely unexplored. Thus, we evaluated the ability of three fungal symbionts of mountain pine beetle to concentrate nitrogen and produce ergosterol while infecting phloem of a novel host jack pine. Ergosterol was used as proxy to determine the fungal biomass (hyphal density) in the current study. We inoculated 80 trees in two forest stands with one of the three fungal species or a non-fungal (control) agar. Six weeks later, we collected phloem from the necrotic lesions induced by the fungi, uninfected tissues adjacent to lesions, and non-inoculated control trees. We found that nutritional contributions varied with fungal species. Nitrogen in lesions was higher in trees inoculated with Ophiostoma montium or control trees, relative to Grosmannia clavigera or Leptographium longiclavatum. Furthermore, concentrations of ergosterol were higher in O. montium lesions compared to other tissues or treatments. These results suggest that O. montium differs from G. clavigera and L. longiclavatum in terms of acquiring nitrogen from host tissues and producing ergosterol. © Copyright © 2020 Guevara-Rozo, Hussain, Cale, Klutsch, Rajabzadeh and Erbilgin.",Guevara-Rozo S.; Hussain A.; Cale J.A.; Klutsch J.G.; Rajabzadeh R.; Erbilgin N.,NA,,NA,"Guevara-Rozo, Sydne (57206857439); Hussain, Altaf (57191483281); Cale, Jonathan A.

7,,,Both,"Finding toxic, fungal endophyte-infected, grass cultivars that are not avoided by phytophagous insects could be an advantageous strategy when mixing Kentucky bluegrass, Poa pratensis L., and endophyte-infected grasses to control turfgrass pests. Field observations revealed that nymphs of the hairy chinch bug, Blissus lucopterus hirstus Montandon, are found mainly in thatch rather than on plants, regardless of time of day. We therefore developed laboratory bioassays incorporating thatch as a component of the hairy chinch bug habitat as a Ist step toward searching for advantageous grass-endophyte associations for chinch bug management in northeastern America. In nonchoice tests, a high incidence of endophyte (Neotyphodium) infection in tillers of the perennial ryegrass 'Prelude II', Lolium perenne L., induced high mortality of 3rd instars, whereas Prelude II with lower incidence of infected tillers or the Kentucky bluegrass 'Merit' were significantly more suitable. Incidence of infected plants affected nymph habitat selection, because all individuals in the presence of Prelude II with elevated percentage of infected tillers were found in thatch, whereas a significantly higher proportion of plants was colonized by nymphs confined with Prelude II with a lower incidence of endophyte infection or with Merit. In choice tests, Merit was strongly preferred over Prelude Ii, regardless of endophyte status of the ryegrass. Moreover, nymph mortality was not affected by the presence of endophyte-infected Prelude II when Merit was also available. These results suggest that highly mobile 3rd-instar hairy chinch bugs have the capacity to avoid toxic endophyte-infected grass cultivars. Such behavior could limit the value of mixing endophyte-infected grasses with Kentucky bluegrass for lawn protection, unless toxic cultivars that are not avoided by the hairy chinch bug can be found.","Carrière, Y; Bouchard, A; Bourassa, S; Brodeur, J",NA,NA,NA,"Carrière, Y; Bouchard, A; Bourassa, S; Brodeur, J",NA,"Effect of endophyte incidence in perennial ryegrass on distribution, host-choice, and performance of the hairy chinch bug (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae)",JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0022-0493,NA,NA,NA,NA,FEB,1998,91,1,NA,NA,NA,324,328,NA,10.1093/jee/91.1.324,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jee/91.1.324,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000073139800045,NA,3396,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,
8,,,Both,"The common forage grass Lolium perenne has evolved with the systemic fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae var. lolii. The endophyte provides herbivore resistance to the grass due to defensive alkaloids, some of which are toxic to grazing livestock. In this field study, we determine whether distribution of the endophyte-grass association changes along a land-use intensity gradient on 87 managed grasslands in three German regions. Endophyte infections were detected in 66% of the studied sites and infection rates within infected sites ranged from 1% to 95%. Alkaloid concentrations of lolitrem B (vertebrate toxin) exceeded the toxicity thresholds in 50 (14%) of 351 infected plants and of peramine (invertebrate deterrent/toxin) in 12 (3%) of 351 plants. Infection rates and alkaloid concentrations were not significantly affected by land-use intensity and region, but alkaloid concentrations were higher in summer compared to spring. We conclude that risks for livestock intoxication are currently low, as (i) average alkaloid concentrations per grassland were always below toxicity thresholds and as (ii) none of the grasslands was dominated by L.perenne. We suggest avoidance of grass monocultures in Europe to keep intoxication risks for livestock low; we also recommend regular examination of seeds and grasslands, as seed producers might accidentally distribute infected seeds, and as climate warming might further enhance the distribution of Epichloe endophytes in European grasslands.","König, J; Fuchs, B; Krischke, M; Mueller, MJ; Krauss, J",NA,NA,NA,"Koenig, J.; Fuchs, B.; Krischke, M.; Mueller, M.

9,,,Both,"Clethra barbinervis Sieb. et Zucc. is a tree species that grows naturally at several mine sites and seems to be tolerant of high concentrations of heavy metals, such as Cu, Zn, and Pb. The purpose of this study is to clarify the mechanism(s) underlying this species' ability to tolerate the sites' severe heavy-metal pollution by considering C. barbinervis interaction with root fungal endophytes. We measured the heavy metal concentrations of root-zone soil, leaves, branches, and fine roots collected from mature C. barbinervis at Hitachi mine. We isolated fungal endophytes from surface-sterilized root segments, and we examined the growth, and heavy metal and nutrient absorption of C. barbinervis seedlings growing in sterilized mine soil with or without root fungal endophytes. Field analyses showed that C. barbinervis contained considerably high amounts of Cu, Zn, and Pb in fine roots and Zn in leaves. The fungi, Phialocephala fortinii, Rhizodermea veluwensis, and Rhizoscyphus sp. were frequently isolated as dominant fungal endophyte species. Inoculation of these root fungal endophytes to C. barbinervis seedlings growing in sterilized mine soil indicated that these fungi significantly enhanced the growth of C. barbinervis seedlings, increased K uptake in shoots and reduced the concentrations of Cu, Ni, Zn, Cd, and Pb in roots. Without root fungal endophytes, C. barbinervis could hardly grow under the heavy-metal contaminated condition, showing chlorosis, a symptom of heavy-metal toxicity. Our results indicate that the tree C. barbinervis can tolerate high heavy-metal concentrations due to the support of root fungal endophytes including P. fortinii, R. veluwensis, and Rhizoscyphus sp. via growth enhancement, K uptake promotion and decrease of heavy metal concentrations. © 2016 Yamaji et al.

10,,,Presence,"Plant fungal relationships should vary with abiotic and biotic factors to minimise plant stress and are likely to vary seasonally and with age. We investigated how fungal colonisation, specifically arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate fungal endophytes, would vary with species identity and season, and how these interactions change with ontogeny. Plant roots of adults and seedlings of 9 species were collected from heathland and coastal dune habitats along the Australian east coast in New South Wales. Roots were stained and investigated for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophyte structures to determine colonisation strength. Species identity was the most important factor driving colonisation strength, while low rainfall and heatwaves were associated with declining arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonisation in the warmest sampling period. AMF colonisation may be supressed by plants under heat and water stress as a way of avoiding loss of limited photosynthates. Dark septate endophyte colonisation was more common in this time period and may assist with the stress of the warmer, drier conditions. Colonisation by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi differed with age but in unpredictable ways and, along with dark septate endophytes, was evident even in plants that are considered non-mycorrhizal, although more extensive in known mycorrhizal species. The lack of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonisation and the increase in dark septate endophyte colonisation during the most stressful period suggest an uncoupling mechanism in the symbiotic relationship which needs further investigation.","Rayment, JT; Jones, S; French, K",NA,NA,NA,"Rayment, Julia T.; Jones, Shae; French, Kris",NA,Seasonal patterns of fungal colonisation in Australian native plants of different ages,SYMBIOSIS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"; French, Kris/I-8202-2012","Rayment, Julia/0000-0003-2612-9980; French, Kris/0000-0001-6938-2017",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0334-5114,1878-7665,NA,NA,NA,MAR,2020,80,2,NA,NA,NA,169,182,NA,10.1007/s13199-019-00661-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-019-00661-z,NA,20-Jan,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000505413900001,NA,6081,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Samples of grasses were gathered near permanent pastures or along paths in France (93 samples, 13 genera, 22 species). Typical convoluted mycelium was found inside leaf sheaths of four genera, especially in Festuca and Lolium spp. The results suggest that endophytes were present most often in the southern regions where plants may suffer from summer drought. Endophytes were looked for in 489 seed samples (63 genera, 237 species) received from 24 European botanical gardens.

Endophytes enhanced the rate of nematode-induced mortality in all cultivars except Georgia Jesup Improved, and increased the proportion of dead larvae with nematodes in all cultivars except Jamestown II. Endophytes in the cultivar Kentucky 31 were associated with improved nematode establishment in the larvae. No effect on nematode reproduction was found. Since endophytes produce biologically active alkaloids, we tested the effects of an ergot alkaloid, ergotamine tartrate, on the feeding behavior and weight of P. japonica larvae in agar medium. The alkaloid caused feeding deterrence, and reduced the consumption of medium by the larvae, resulting in weight loss. These larvae were more susceptible to H. bacteriophora than the untreated larvae. Unfed 'starved' larvae were more susceptible to nematodes than those fed on untreated agar. Our results support the hypothesis that endophyte-induced starvation of P. japonica would reduce larval vigor, and render them more susceptible to entomopathogenic nematodes.","GREWAL, SK; GREWAL, PS; GAUGLER, R",NA,NA,NA,"GREWAL, SK; GREWAL, PS; GAUGLER, R",NA,ENDOPHYTES OF FESCUE GRASSES ENHANCE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF POPILLIA-JAPONICA LARVAE TO AN ENTOMOPATHOGENIC NEMATODE,ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Grewal, Satvir Kaur/JPX-1648-2023; Gaugler, Randy/K-3898-2013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0013-8703,1570-7458,NA,NA,NA,MAR,1995,74,3,NA,NA,NA,219,224,NA,10.1111/j.1570-7458.1995.tb01894.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1570-7458.1995.tb01894.x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1995QU36100004,NA,9346,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Swainsonine was detected in all parts of Astragalus lentiginosus and Astragalus mollissimus, with greater concentrations found in the aboveground parts. Undifilum oxytropis, a fungal endophyte responsible for the synthesis of swainsonine, was detected in all plant parts of A. lentiginosus and A. mollissimus. The amount of endophyte within a plant part does not always correspond to the concentration of swainsonine in the same part. Plants of A. mollissimus and A. lentiginosus can be divided into two chemotypes: those that contain swainsonine (>0.1%; chemotype 1) and those that contain little or no detectable swainsonine (<0.01%; chemotype 2). Chemotype 1 plants in both species had quantitatively higher amounts of endophyte compared to chemotype 2 plants. Swainsonine and endophyte amounts were not uniformly distributed within stalks of the same plant. For that reason, repeated sampling of stalks from the same plant during one growing season may provide misleading results. Sequence variants of U. oxytropis exist within populations of A. mollissimus, A. lentiginosus, and Oxytropis sericea and do not correlate with chemotype.

We hypothesized that prolonged water deficit results in a range of phenotypic diversity (i.e., green color index) across tall fescue genotypes that are associated with distinct microbial taxonomic and functional traits impacting plant drought tolerance. Microbial extracellular enzyme activities of chitinase and phenol oxidase (targeting chitin and lignin) increased in rhizospheres of the 20 most drought tolerant genotypes. Lower rates of fungal (dark septate) endophyte root infection were found in roots of the most drought tolerant genotypes. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS sequencing showed shifts in microbial communities across water deficit conditions prior to drought, during drought, and at drought recovery, but was not patterned by drought tolerance levels of the plant host. The results suggest that taxonomic information from bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS sequences provided little indication of microbial composition impacting drought tolerance of the host plant, but instead, microbial extracellular enzyme activities and root fungal infection results revealed patterned responses from drought.","Panke-Buisse, K; Cheng, L; Gan, HJ; Wickings, K; Petrovic, M; Kao-Kniffin, J",NA,NA,NA,"Panke-Buisse, Kevin; Cheng, Liang; Gan, Huijie; Wickings, Kyle; Petrovic, Marty; Kao-Kniffin, Jenny",NA,Root Fungal Endophytes and Microbial Extracellular Enzyme Activities Show Patterned Responses in Tall Fescues under Drought Conditions,AGRONOMY-BASEL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Cheng, Liang/AAG-1987-2021","Panke-Buisse, Kevin/0000-0001-8555-1255; Cheng, Liang/0000-0001-6875-2928; Kao-Kniffin, Jenny/0000-0002-9469-8088",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2073-4395,NA,NA,NA,AUG,2020,10,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3390/agronomy10081076,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy10081076,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000567651400001,NA,6122,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four plant genotypes with (E+) and without (experimentally removed, E-) their respective haplotypes (two haplotypes in two plant genotypes) of Neotyphodium were grown in the field under manipulated soil moisture and nutrients. Peramine production required the presence of the endophyte; plants without their endophytes did not contain peramine. Whereas the endophyte was necessary for peramine production, levels of peramine did not vary by Neotyphodium haplotype within plant genotypes. Furthermore, peramine levels did not differ among soil moisture and nutrient treatments, and growth and reproductive measures of the host grass explained little of variation in peramine levels. Instead, peramine levels differed significantly between plant genotypes harboring the same endophyte haplotype, suggesting that plant genotype, rather than endophyte haplotype or environment, largely determines levels of peramine in Arizona fescue. The results suggest that whereas the endophyte is required for peramine production, the plant genotypic background in which the endophyte is embedded, rather than endophyte haplotype or environmental factors, mostly influences peramine levels within this population of Arizona fescue.","Faeth, SH; Bush, LP; Sullivan, TJ",NA,NA,NA,"Faeth, SH; Bush, LP; Sullivan, TJ",NA,Peramine alkaloid variation in <i>Neotyphodium</i>-infected Arizona fescue:: Effects of endophyte and host genotype and environment,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0098-0331,NA,NA,NA,NA,AUG,2002,28,8,NA,NA,NA,1511,1526,NA,10.1023/A:1019916227153,http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1019916227153,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12371807,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000177722600002,NA,9343,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In B. setifolius endophyte incidence was positively correlated with annual average rainfall contrary to the results found in Ph. alpinum. All the populations of P. spiciformis were infected by endophytes and the incidence was associated with plant community. The Neotyphodium-grass interaction is variable in natural populations, supporting the increasing evidence that the Neotyphodium-host interaction depends, in many cases, on the environmental conditions.

Significant correlations between richness and diversity indices were observed (p < 0.05), and mycobiomes did not differ between habitats in the current study. Species richness and diversity were higher in twigs compared to spring buds, and the assemblages in twigs shared most similarities. Interaction network analyses revealed that twig-bound fungi shared similar numbers of (interaction) links with others, dominated by negative co-occurrences, suggesting that competitive exclusion may be the predominant ecological interaction in the highly connected twig mycobiome.

The fungal community was shaped to large extent by stochastic processes, as indicated by high level of variation even between individuals from local populations of the same plant species, and confirmed by the neutral community model and Raup-Crick index. Nevertheless, we still found strong determinism in FEC assembly with both incidence and abundance data sets. Substantial differences in community composition across host species and locations were revealed. Our research demonstrated that assembly of FECs is affected by stochastic as well as deterministic processes and suggests strong effects of environment heterogeneity and plant species on community composition. In addition, a small number of taxa had high incidence and abundance in all of the 15 populations.

We quantified the effects of the presence of the common toxic endophyte (CT), two novel endophyte genotypes (AR-542, AR-584), no endophyte (endophyte free, E-), and a mixture of all endophyte statuses (mix) within a single genotype of tall fescue (PDF) on various soil and plant parameters. Endophyte presence and genotype affected tall fescue cover and plant species diversity: cover-CT, AR-542, AR -584, mix > E- and species diversity-E- > AR-542, AR -584 > CT, mix. Most measured soil parameters had significant endophyte effects. For example, higher fluxes of soil CO2 and N2O were measured from stands of AR-542 than from the other endophyte treatments. These results indicate that endophyte presence and genetic identity are important in understanding the ecosystem-scale effects of this agronomically important grass-fungal symbiosis.","Iqbal, J; Nelson, JA; McCulley, RL",NA,NA,NA,"Iqbal, Javed; Nelson, Jim A.; McCulley, Rebecca L.",NA,Fungal endophyte presence and genotype affect plant diversity and soil-to-atmosphere trace gas fluxes,PLANT AND SOIL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Iqbal, Javed/AAN-6728-2021","Iqbal, Javed/0000-0003-1199-5923; Iqbal, Javed/0000-0002-3293-9827",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0032-079X,1573-5036,NA,NA,NA,MAR,2013,364,2-Jan,NA,NA,NA,15,27,NA,10.1007/s11104-012-1326-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-012-1326-0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000314722800003,NA,5474,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,,,Both,"Grasses hosting Epichloe endophytes are protected against herbivores due to the production of various fungal alkaloids. Previous research has found that high foliar phosphorus concentrations reduce the level of the alkaloid ergovaline, thereby reducing the endophyte-mediated herbivore resistance. Yet, the impact of phosphorus on ergovaline biosynthesis versus its influence on endophyte growth and synthesis of other fungal alkaloids remains unresolved. Our objective was to elucidate these relationships. We grew endophyte-symbiotic and non-symbiotic Festuca arundinacea plants and fertilised them with different doses of phosphorus. Later, half of the plants from each treatment were challenged with larvae of the generalist chewing insect Spodoptera frugiperda. We assessed the relationships between foliar phosphorus levels, fungal mycelium and alkaloid concentrations, as well as their impacts on larvae performance, herbivore-caused damage and plant biomass.<br /> Endophyte mycelial biomass in plant tissue was found to be independent of foliar phosphorus concentration. The alkaloids lolines and peramine showed a linear relationship with mycelial biomass but no correlation with foliar phosphorus. Surprisingly, high ergovaline concentrations were positively associated with an interaction between endophyte mycelial biomass and foliar phosphorus concentration. Although herbivory increased loline concentration, only high concentrations of ergovaline and peramine were related to reduced S. frugiperda larvae weight gain. However, endophyte presence did not reduce herbivory damage on plants.<br /> Contrary to expectation, we did not find a negative but a positive association between concentrations of foliar phosphorus and ergovaline alkaloid, through its interaction with endophyte mycelial biomass. Alternatively, our findings suggest that phosphorus plays a crucial role in modulating the Epichlo & euml;-mediated defensive mutualism, primarily through its effects on ergovaline rather than on endophyte concentration or production of other alkaloids.","Decunta, FA; Pérez, LI; Graff, P; Gundel, PE",NA,NA,NA,"Decunta, F.

22,,,Presence,"Wetland soils are defined by anoxic and reducing conditions that impose biogeochemically hostile conditions on plant roots and their endogenous fungal communities. The cosmopolitan wetland plant Typha L. mitigates root-zone anoxia efficiently, such that roots of these plants may constitute fungal habitats similar to roots in subaerially exposed soils. Alternatively, fungi may compete with plant cells for limited oxygen in inundated roots. We hypothesized that extrinsic environmental factors may reduce fungal incidence and affect fungal community structure within inundated roots as compared with those in subaerially exposed soils. We sampled roots of Typha spp. plants across inundation gradients in constructed reservoirs; root subsamples were microscopically examined for fungal structures, and morphologically distinct fungal endophytes were cultured and isolated from surface-sterilized subsamples. We found that the incidence of fungal hyphae was suppressed for all types of vegetative mycelia when roots were inundated, regardless of depth, but that there were no obvious differences in community composition of fungi cultured from roots growing in inundated versus subaerially exposed soils. This suggests that the suppression of hyphae we observed in root samples did not result from changes in community composition. Instead, low hyphal incidence in inundated Typha roots may reflect germinal inhibition or unsuccessful initial colonization, possibly owing to plant-mediated redox dynamism in the surrounding soil. No variation was seen in the incidence of asexual spores, or chytridiomycetes, nor were there significant differences between geographically disparate sampling sites. Communities of root-endogenous fungi may therefore be influenced more strongly by external environmental factors than by the environments that plant roots comprise.","Klymiuk, AA; Sikes, BA",NA,NA,NA,"Klymiuk, Ashley A.; Sikes, Benjamin A.",NA,Suppression of root-endogenous fungi in persistently inundated <i>Typha</i> roots,MYCOLOGIA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sikes, Benjamin/G-8895-2018","Klymiuk, Ashley/0000-0003-1758-8720; Sikes, Benjamin/0000-0003-0774-2624",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0027-5514,1557-2536,NA,NA,NA,3-Sep,2019,111,5,NA,NA,NA,748,757,NA,10.1080/00275514.2019.1635388,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00275514.2019.1635388,NA,19-Aug,NA,NA,NA,NA,31390954,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000480852200001,NA,9453,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied whether the associations between Bromus auleticus and their endophytes, Neotyphodium pampeanum and Neotyphodium tembladerae, are beneficial for this wild forage grass native to South America. In a greenhouse experiment, 3-month-old endophyte-infected plants (E+) showed enhanced growth relative to their endophyte-free counterparts (E-). In a one-year-long experiment in the field, E+ plants showed higher survival and regrowth rate, and produced more biomass and seeds than E- plants. Only with respect to the seed output did N.similar to tembladerae seem to be detrimental, whereas N.similar to pampeanum did not affect this parameter. No differences were observed with respect to the germination of seeds produced by E+ or E- plants. Loline alkaloids were detected in N.similar to pampeanum-infected plants.

Yet, whether seed-borne endophytes enhance the host plant's ability to overcome colonisation barriers and to regenerate within invaded sites remains poorly understood. We examined how symbiosis with asexual endophytic fungi (Neotyphodium) affected establishment and seed loss to predators in the invasive annual grass Lolium multiflorum (Italian ryegrass) across contrasting successional plots. Italian ryegrass seeds with high and low endophyte incidence were sown into three communities: a 1-year-old fallow field, a 15-year-old grassland, and a 24-year-old forest, which conformed to an old-field chronosequence in the eastern Inland Pampa, Argentina. We found that endophyte infection consistently increased host population recruitment and reproductive output. Endophyte presence also enhanced aerial biomass production of ryegrass in a low recruitment year but not in a high recruitment year, suggesting that symbiotic effects on growth performance are density dependent. Endophyte presence reduced seed removal by rodents, although differential predation may not account for the increased success of infected grass populations. Overall, there was no statistical evidence for an endophyte-by-site interaction, indicating that the fungal endosymbiont benefitted host establishment regardless of large differences in biotic and abiotic environment among communities. Our results imply that hereditary endophytes may increase the chances for host grass species to pass various ecological filters associated with invasion resistance across a broad range of successional habitats.","Uchitel, A; Omacini, M; Chaneton, EJ",NA,NA,NA,"Uchitel, Andrea; Omacini, Marina; Chaneton, Enrique J.",NA,Inherited fungal symbionts enhance establishment of an invasive annual grass across successional habitats,OECOLOGIA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Omacini, Marina/0000-0003-1460-262X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0029-8549,1432-1939,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2011,165,2,NA,NA,NA,465,475,NA,10.1007/s00442-010-1740-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-010-1740-z,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,20686788,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000286224900020,NA,6277,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,

26,,,Presence,"Efforts to introduce pathogen resistance into landscape tree species by breeding may have unintended consequences for fungal diversity. To address this issue, we compared the frequency and diversity of endophytic fungi and defensive phenolic metabolites in elm (Ulmus spp.) trees with genotypes known to differ in resistance to Dutch elm disease. Our results indicate that resistant U. minor and U. pumila genotypes exhibit a lower frequency and diversity of fungal endophytes in the xylem than susceptible U. minor genotypes. However, resistant and susceptible genotypes showed a similar frequency and diversity of endophytes in the leaves and bark. The resistant and susceptible genotypes could be discriminated on the basis of the phenolic profile of the xylem, but not on basis of phenolics in the leaves or bark. As the Dutch elm disease pathogen develops within xylem tissues, the defensive chemistry of resistant elm genotypes thus appears to be one of the factors that may limit colonization by both the pathogen and endophytes. We discuss a potential trade-off between the benefits of breeding resistance into tree species, versus concomitant losses of fungal endophytes and the ecosystem services they provide. © 2013 Martín et al.",Martín J.A.; Witzell J.; Blumenstein K.; Rozpedowska E.; Helander M.; Sieber T.N.; Gil L.,NA,,NA,"Martín, Juan A.

27,,,Presence,"Plants possess a sophisticated hormone-signaling system, which includes salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA), to defend themselves from herbivores. In addition, this immune system is modulated by nonpathogenic microbes that live asymptomatically within intercellular spaces of host grasses. We investigated the resistance triggered by defense hormones, and that provided by endophyte Epichloe gansuensis against aphid Rhopalosiphum padi, and how the endophyte regulates this tripartite interaction. We detected that endophyte-induced plant tolerance to the aphid feeding and exogenous SA increased plant shoot biomass, root biomass, plant length, and chlorophyll content. Endophyte colonization induces the WRKY54 factor that overrides negative effects on plant growth and possibly suppresses SA accumulation. In addition, the endophyte promotes a level of JA that is antagonistic to the SA pathway. By disabling the SA mechanism for herbivore-mediated plant growth inhibition, the endophyte induces plant tolerance to herbivory.","He, YL; Chen, TX; Zhang, HJ; White, JF; Li, CJ",NA,NA,NA,"He, Yali; Chen, Taixiang; Zhang, Haijuan; White, James F.; Li, Chunjie",NA,Fungal Endophytes Help Grasses to Tolerate Sap-Sucking Herbivores Through a Hormone-Signaling System,JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"White, James/C-2280-2009; Li, Chunjie/G-4988-2012","Li, Chunjie/0000-0002-3287-2140",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0721-7595,1435-8107,NA,NA,NA,AUG,2022,41,6,NA,NA,NA,2122,2137,NA,10.1007/s00344-021-10430-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00344-021-10430-2,NA,21-Jul,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000668816900003,NA,6294,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,,,Both,"Microbial plant symbionts have been suggested to mediate plant-soil feedback and affect ecosystem functions. Systemic EpichloA << fungal endophytes of grasses are found to mediate litter decomposition. These effects are often linked to alkaloids produced by EpichloA << species, which are hypothesized to negatively affect decomposers. Although endophytes have been found to affect plant community and soil biota, direct (through litter quality) and indirect (through the environment) effects of fungal endophytes on litter decomposition have been scarcely scrutinized. We placed litterbags with endophyte-symbiotic (E+) and non-symbiotic (E-) Schedonorus pratensis plant litter in plots dominated by E+ or E- plants of the same species, and followed the dynamics of mass losses over time. We predicted the endophyte would hinder decomposition through changes in litter quality and that both types of litter would decompose faster in home environments. E+ litter decomposed faster in both environments. The mean difference between decomposition rate of E+ and E- litter tended to be higher in E- plots. Nitrogen and phosphorus, two elements usually associated with high decomposition rates, were significantly lower in E+ litter. We also detected a higher proportion of C in the cellulose form in E+ litter. Contrary to the general assumption, we found that symbiosis with EpichloA << fungal endophytes can be associated with higher decomposition of plant litter. Since direct effects of EpichloA << fungi were still stronger than indirect effects, it is suggested that besides the alkaloids, other changes in plant biomass would explain in a context-dependent manner, the endophyte effects on the litter decomposition.","Gundel, PE; Helander, M; Garibaldi, LA; Vázquez-De-Aldana, BR; Zabalgogeazcoa, I; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, P.

29,,,Both,"Endophytic fungal symbionts of grasses are well known for their protective benefit of herbivory reduction. However, the majority of studies on endophyte-grass symbioses have been conducted on economically important, agricultural species-particularly tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne)-raising the hypothesis that strong benefits are the product of artificial selection. We examined whether fungal endophytes found in natural populations of native grass species deterred insect herbivores. By testing several native grass-endophyte symbiota, we examined phylogenetic signals in the effects of endophytes on insects and compared the relative importance of herbivore and symbiotum identity in the outcome of the interactions. Preference was assessed using three herbivore species [Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera), Schistocerca americana (Orthoptera), Rhopalosiphum padi (Hemiptera)] and ten native symbiota, which spanned seven grass genera. We also assessed herbivore performance in a no choice experiment for five native symbiota against S. frugiperda. We compared greenhouse and laboratory trials with natural levels of herbivory measured in experimental field populations. In all cases, we included the agronomic grass species, L. arundinaceum, to compare with results from the native grasses. Both in the field and in experimental trials, herbivores showed a significant preference for endophyte-free plant material for the majority of native grasses, with up to three times lower herbivory for endophyte-symbiotic plants; however, the degree of response depended on the identity of the herbivore species.

In contrast, the endophyte in L. arundinaceum had few significant anti-herbivore effects, except for a reduction in herbivory at one of two field sites.

We assessed the effects of land use change (natural, semi-natural and planted (completely transformed)) and differences in surrounding vegetation types (grasses/low-growing plants versus shrubs/trees versus other olives) using fungal endophyte alpha and beta diversity measures. Co-occurrence networks were constructed to assess assemblage connectivity under different scenarios and to identify OTUs of potential ecological significance.ResultsOTU richness, but not abundance, was significantly influenced by both land use change and differences in the surrounding vegetation types. Planted African olives and those surrounded by heterospecific trees harboured the highest OTU richness. Only levels of land use change significantly influenced fungal endophyte assemblage composition. Specifically, fungal assemblages from natural habitats were distinct from those in planted and semi-natural habitats, which were similar to each other. Co-occurrence network analyses revealed that cohesive and species rich networks could only be maintained within the natural habitats.ConclusionThese findings suggest that although the African olive is widespread, the identity and composition of their associated fungal assemblages are particularly sensitive to land use change.

So far most studies that have investigated horse chestnut trees have observed their above ground characteristics, whereas the roots structure and symbiotic associations with mycorrhizal arbuscular fungi have been poorly recognized. Therefore, our objective was to perform a detailed study of horse chestnut fine roots and the extent of their colonization by mycorrhizal fungi in urban and rural environments. In the urban area two different study sites were selected: one in the street and the second in city parks. Two rural sites comprised the roadside verges planted with horse chestnut trees in open countryside. The chemical composition of soils revealed significant differences between study sites. The biometric parameters of fine roots are only partly related to soil characteristics. The results revealed a lack of a clear negative effect of the urban environment on fine root parameters, which may suggest a high degree of plasticity in this species in response to heterogeneity of the soil. At all study sites the fine roots of horse chestnut were colonized by arbuscular fungi (AM) and fungal endophytes. Trees from all study sites revealed a similar range of AM colonization. Significant differences were found only between one rural and one urban park site. The results from urban and rural sites revealed horse chestnut as a tree species well adapted to both rural and urban conditions and presented well-established mycorrhizal symbiosis with arbuscular fungi.

We determined with light microscopy and isolations that tissues of V. phaeantha and the cultivated hybrid were infected by a bacterial endophyte and that shoot meristems and stomatal areas of stems and leaves were densely colonized. We identified the endophyte as B. amyloliquefaciens using DNA sequence data. Since additional endophyte-free plants and seed of this orchid were not available, additional studies were performed on surrogate hosts Amaranthus caudatus, Ipomoea tricolor, and I. purpurea. Plants of A. caudatus inoculated with B. amyloliquefaciens demonstrated intracellular colonization of guard cells and other epidermal cells, confirming the pattern observed in the orchids. Isolations and histological studies suggest that the bacterium may penetrate deeply into developing plant tissues in shoot meristems, forming endospores in maturing tissues. B. amyloliquefaciens produced fungal inhibitors in culture. In controlled experiments using morning glory seedlings we showed that the bacterium promoted seedling growth and reduced seedling necrosis due to pathogens. We detected the gene for phosphopantetheinyl transferase (sfp), an enzyme in the pathway for production of antifungal lipopeptides, and purified the lipopeptide surfactin from cultures of the bacterium. We hypothesize that B. amyloliquefaciens is a robust endophyte and defensive mutualist of vanilla orchids. Whether the symbiosis between this bacterium and its hosts can be managed to protect vanilla crops from diseases is a question that should be evaluated in future research. Microsc. Res.

Our objective was to examine the effects of systemic endophytes on the competitive ability of two agronomically important grass species: meadow fescue [Festuca pratensis (Huds.) syn. Schedonorus pratensis (Huds.) P. Beauv] and tall fescue [Festuca arundinacea (Schreb.) syn. Schedonorus phoenix (Scop.)]. Plants of meadow and tall fescue were grown for 48days in replacement series of interspecific mixture with a legume (red clover, Trifolium pratense L.) in different nutrient environments in a greenhouse. Neither of the grass species gained endophyte-promoted competitive advantage over red clover in grass-clover mixtures. Endophyte infection increased the growth of meadow fescue monocultures by 89% compared to endophyte-free monocultures in high-nutrient soils, but plant competition or the cost of endophyte infection to the meadow fescue decreased the yield in resource-limited conditions. On average, endophyte-infected and endophyte-free meadow fescues produced 015 and 017g, and 014 and 014g dry biomass per plant in mixtures with red clover in high- and low-nutrient soils respectively. In contrast to meadow fescue, endophyte-promoted growth of tall fescue monocultures was not detected. Endophyte-infected and endophyte-free tall fescue monocultures produced 076 and 095g biomass per pot, respectively, in the high-nutrient environment.

34,,,Presence,"Global climate change is increasing pest and pathogen pressures on plant communities, deteriorating optimal plant functioning. In plant communities, root functional trait expression and microbial communities are important indicators of plant functioning belowground, and, when confronted with pathogens aboveground, can simultaneously reflect plant defence strategies. Yet, while research is continuing to emerge on the response of root functional traits and microbial processes to pathogens aboveground, little work has investigated these interactions in tree-crops, or the role organic amendments play in moderating these relationships. The main objective of this study is to disentangle the dynamic effects of pathogens and amendments on root functional traits (i.e. specific root length and area, root diameter, root length density, root nitrogen and root carbon to nitrogen ratio) and root endophytic fungal communities. As a model, we use Coffea arabica (coffee) variety Caturra along a gradient of coffee leaf rust - a foliar disease prominent in coffee systems - under contrasting but widespread amendment regimes in biodiverse agroforestry systems. We found that root trait expression varies along established conservation and collaboration gradients, where fungal endophyte community composition varies significantly as a function of root traits. Belowground resource acquisition strategies do not change with foliar disease incidence, suggesting they may be decoupled. Rather, amendment regimes differentially shape root trait expression and microbial communities, where coffee plants under organic amendments, regardless of foliar disease incidence, expressed greater acquisitive traits and enhanced collaboration with symbiotic fungi. This is an important first step in disentangling the dynamic inter-relationships between plant traits, endophytes and pathogens, generating new questions on the role of amendments in sustainable pathogen management in biodiverse agroecosystems.","Gagliardi, S; Avelino, J; Fulthorpe, R; Virginio, ED; Isaac, ME",NA,NA,NA,"Gagliardi, Stephanie; Avelino, Jacques; Fulthorpe, Roberta; Virginio Filho, Elias de Melo; Isaac, Marney E.",NA,No evidence of foliar disease impact on crop root functional strategies and soil microbial communities: what does this mean for organic coffee?,OIKOS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gagliardi, Stephanie/ABE-9174-2021; Avelino, Jacques/C-5624-2009","Gagliardi, Stephanie/0000-0003-1612-0173; Avelino, Jacques/0000-0003-1983-9431",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0030-1299,1600-0706,NA,NA,NA,JAN,2023,2023,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1111/oik.08987,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/oik.08987,NA,22-Feb,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000754562000001,NA,4044,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although not adapted to salt or drought stress, two commercial rice varieties achieved tolerance to these stresses by colonizing them with Class 2 fungal endophytes isolated from plants growing across moisture and salinity gradients. Plant growth and development, water usage, ROS sensitivity and osmolytes were measured with and without stress under controlled conditions. The endophytes conferred salt, drought and cold tolerance to growth chamber and greenhouse grown plants. Endophytes reduced water consumption by 20-30% and increased growth rate, reproductive yield, and biomass of greenhouse grown plants. In the absence of stress, there was no apparent cost of the endophytes to plants, however, endophyte colonization decreased from 100% at planting to 65% compared to greenhouse plants grown under continual stress (maintained 100% colonization).

How the specialization of guilds of organisms varies along environmental gradients underpins popular theories of biogeography and macroecology, whereas the degree of specialization of a species is typically considered fixed.

In this study, we examine how specialization within a bipartite network consisting of three co-occurring plant species and their foliar fungal endophyte symbionts changes along a 1000-meter elevation gradient where host species were held constant. The gradient, along the slope of Mauna Loa shield volcano, represents almost the entire elevational range of two of the three plants. Network and plant specialization values displayed a parabolic relationship with elevation, and were highest at middle elevations, whereas bipartite associations were least specific at low and high elevations. Shannon's diversity of fungal endophytes correlated negatively with specificity, and was highest at the ends of the transects. Although plant host was a strong determinant of fungal community composition within sites, fungal species turnover was high among sites.

Tripsacum dactyloides (Eastern gamagrass) is a perennial, drought-tolerant grass native to the tallgrass prairies of the central USA. The extent to which the microbiome of T. dactyloides contributes to its drought tolerance is unknown. Ninety-seven genotypes of T. dactyloides were collected from native populations across an east-west precipitation gradient in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, and then grown together in a common garden for over 20 years. Root and leaf samples were visually examined for fungal density. Because fungal endophytes confer drought-tolerant capabilities to their host plants, we expected to find higher densities of fungal endophytes in plants from western, drier regions, compared to plants from eastern, wetter regions. Results confirmed a negative correlation between endophyte densities in roots and precipitation at the genotype's original location (r = -0.21 P = 0.04). Our analyses reveal that the host genotype's origin along the precipitation gradient predicts the absolute abundance of symbionts in the root, but not the relative abundances of particular organisms or the overall community composition. Overall, these results demonstrate that genetic variation for plant-microbe interactions can reflect historical environment, and reinforce the importance of considering plant genotype in conservation and restoration work in tallgrass prairie ecosystems. Individuals of Tripsacum dactyloides (Eastern Gamagrass), a tallgrass prairie native, collected across the central USA retain distinct genotypic and local adaptation patterns long after transplanting into a single garden with a common environment. We found individuals of T. dactyloides originally from drier areas had higher densities of fungal endophytes in their roots. This demonstrates that plants are able to selectively recruit microbes from their immediate environment in a way that reflects their historic environment due to the plant's genetics.

We found that Epichloe increased richness of root endophytes in Ammophila by 17% overall, but only shifted community composition of root endophytes under nitrogen-enriched conditions. These results indicate that Epichloe acts as a key species within Ammophila, changing richness and composition of the root mycobiome and integrating above- and belowground mycobiome interactions. Further, effects of Epichloe on root endophyte communities were enhanced by N addition, indicating that this fungal species may become even more important in future environments.","Garces, KR; Sage, HE; Christian, N; Emery, SM",NA,NA,NA,"Garces, Kylea R.; Sage, Haley E.; Christian, Natalie; Emery, Sarah M.",NA,<i>Epichloe</i> Increases Root Fungal Endophyte Richness and Alters Root Fungal Endophyte Composition in a Changing World,JOURNAL OF FUNGI,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Emery, Sarah/AFR-1495-2022","Emery, Sarah/0000-0003-2496-6152; Garces, Kylea/0000-0002-4045-9786",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2309-608X,NA,NA,NA,NOV,2022,8,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3390/jof8111142,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof8111142,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36354909,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000881116500001,NA,6249,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,,,Both,"Interactions among plants may be influenced by pests or parasites that differentially affect one competitor. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of fungal parasitism and insect herbivory, alone and in concert, on plant competitive interactions. The effects of fungal endophyte (Acremonium spp.) infection and fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) herbivory on competitive interactions in one- and two-species mixtures of the grasses tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), red fescue (F. rubra), and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) were examined in greenhouse experiments. In general, herbivory reduced plant biomass whereas endophyte infection increased plant biomass. Endophyte-infected (E+) plants were less damaged by herbivory than uninfected (E-) plants of the same species. Studies on fall armyworm larval feeding and choice tests with the five grass species were generally consistent with the outcome of the competition experiments; E+ plants were less nutritious and less preferred than E- plants of the same species. There were significant interactions among factors so that the outcome of competition depended on the species identities and the presence or absence of endophytes and herbivores. In competition with Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis), E+ and E- perennial ryegrass produced similar biomass in the absence of herbivory, but E+ perennial ryegrass had nearly twice the biomass of E- plants when herbivores were present. E+ and E- tall fescue were poor competitors with orchard grass (Dactylis glomerata) when herbivores were absent, but E+ tall fescue was a better competitor than E- plants and orchard grass when herbivores were present. This study indicates that competitive hierarchies among grasses are altered by interactions with insect herbivores and fungal endophytes, which have typically been ignored in past studies.","CLAY, K; MARKS, S; CHEPLICK, GP",NA,NA,NA,"CLAY, K; MARKS, S; CHEPLICK, GP",NA,EFFECTS OF INSECT HERBIVORY AND FUNGAL ENDOPHYTE INFECTION ON COMPETITIVE INTERACTIONS AMONG GRASSES,ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Clay, Keith/C-8730-2012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0012-9658,NA,NA,NA,NA,SEP,1993,74,6,NA,NA,NA,1767,1777,NA,10.2307/1939935,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1939935,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1993LV24200017,NA,4657,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,,,Review,"Plant tissues host a variety of fungi. One important group is the dark septate endophytes (DSEs) that colonize plant roots and form characteristic intracellular structures melanized hyphae and microsclerotia. The DSE associations are common and frequently observed in various biomes and plant taxa. Reviews suggest that the proportion of plant species colonized by DSE equal that colonized by AM and microscopic studies show that the proportion of the root system colonized by fungi DSE can equal, or even exceed, the colonization by AM fungi. Despite the high frequency and suspected ecological importance, the effects of DSE colonization on plant growth and performance have remained unclear. Here, we draw from over a decade of experimentation with the obscure DSE symbiosis and synthesize across large bodies of published and unpublished data from Arabidopsis thaliana and Allium porrum model systems as well as from experiments that use native plants to better resolve the host responses to DSE colonization. The data indicate similar distribution of host responses in model and native plant studies, validating the use of model plants for tractable dissection of DSE symbioses. The available data also permit empirical testing of the environmental modulation of host responses to DSE colonization and refining the ""mutualism-parasitism-continuum"" paradigm for DSE symbioses. These data highlight the context dependency of the DSE symbioses: not only plant species but also ecotypes vary in their responses to populations of conspecific DSE fungi environmental conditions further shift the host responses similar to those predicted based on the mutualism-parasitism-continuum paradigm. The model systems provide several established avenues of inquiry that permit more detailed molecular and functional dissection of fungal endophyte symbioses, identifying thus likely mechanisms that may underlie the observed host responses to endophyte colonization.","Mandyam, KG; Jumpponen, A",NA,NA,NA,"Mandyam, Keerthi G.; Jumpponen, Ari",NA,Mutualism-parasitism paradigm synthesized from results of root-endophyte models,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-302X,NA,NA,NA,12-Jan,2015,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3389/fmicb.2014.00776,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00776,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25628615,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000348724100002,NA,6142,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,,,Presence,"Fungal endophytes have been documented in almost all terrestrial plant groups. Although the endophyte infection syndrome in agronomic cultivars is well studied, relatively little work addresses questions of spatial ecology and fire effects on epichloae endophyte infection in native grasses, and none, to our knowledge, in sub-Saharan Africa. We sampled seven populations of the native Festuca costata Nees along the spline of the Drakensberg range in South Africa at several spatial scales, including both recently burned and unburned stands. We tested epichloae presence and prevalence with immunoblot assays, PCR and genetic sequencing. We found epichloae endophytes were present and prevalent (38-98% infection rates depending on location). Variation in infection rates occurred primarily among locations, but also among bunches. There was little evidence that endophyte infection rates varied with fire. Novel evidence of epichloae infection of a native Festuca in South Africa opens the door to several new research questions, from the phylogenetic relationship between epichloae of sub-Saharan Africa and other continents to the ecological advantages or disadvantages that endophytes confer upon their hosts, especially in a fire-prone ecosystem vulnerable to global environmental change.","McGranahan, DA; Burgdorf, R; Kirkman, KP",NA,NA,NA,"McGranahan, D.

44,,,Presence,"Plant-associated fungal communities play a vital role in plant adaptations, physiological functions, and productivity. Therefore, it is important to reveal the mechanisms driving the assembly of these communities. Yet it is still not fully understood how community assembly and structure differentiate in plant compartments, growth seasons, and varieties at large geographic distances. In this study, we analyzed bulk soil and plant-associated fungal communities of five wheat varieties across two growth stages in three biogeographic sites with distances of about 324, 534, or 800 km apart between any two locations. Our results indicated that the fungal community varied primarily across the sample types (leaf endosphere, root endosphere, rhizosphere, and bulk soil), followed by growth stage. Compared with the regreening stage, lower alpha-diversity and more dominance by abundant species in the fungal community were observed in wheat-associated compartments (four sample types except for bulk soil) at the heading stage. Additionally, within each wheat-associated compartment across every growth stage, location had stronger effects on fungal community assembly than the wheat variety. The effects of variety on fungal community assembly were location specific as were the growth-stage patterns of varietal effects on leaf endosphere and rhizosphere fungal communities. We further detected a less diverse but abundant core fungal taxa that could be grouped into three clusters associated mainly with location. This study characterized the interplay effects between plant selection (compartment, growth stage, variety) and environment (location) on wheat-associated mycobiomes by determining drivers of fungal community assembly and core fungal taxa in field conditions.","Zheng, YY; Li, XZ; Cao, HL; Lei, L; Zhang, X; Han, DJ; Wang, JM; Yao, MJ",NA,NA,NA,"Zheng, Yuyin; Li, Xiangzhen; Cao, Huili; Lei, Li; Zhang, Xue; Han, Dejun; Wang, Junming; Yao, Minjie",NA,The assembly of wheat-associated fungal community differs across growth stages,APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wang, Junming/AAD-9636-2019","Li, xiangzhen/0000-0001-6499-0179; Yao, Minjie/0000-0001-7501-0519",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0175-7598,1432-0614,NA,NA,NA,OCT,2021,105,19,NA,NA,NA,7427,7438,NA,10.1007/s00253-021-11550-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-021-11550-1,NA,21-Sep,NA,NA,NA,NA,34505913,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000694774600001,NA,6150,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,,,Presence,"Fungal endophytes modify plant-herbivore interactions by producing toxic alkaloids that deter herbivory. However, studies have neglected the direct effects herbivores may have on endophytes. Antifungal properties and signalling effectors in herbivore saliva suggest that evolutionary pressures may select for animals that mitigate the effects of endophyte-produced alkaloids. Here, we tested whether saliva of moose (Alces alces) and European reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) reduced hyphal elongation and production of ergot alkaloids by the foliar endophyte Epichloefestucae associated with the globally distributed red fescue Festuca rubra. Both moose and reindeer saliva reduced the growth of isolated endophyte hyphae when compared with a treatment of distilled water. Induction of the highly toxic alkaloid ergovaline was also inhibited in plants from the core of F. rubra's distribution when treated with moose saliva following simulated grazing. In genotypes from the southern limit of the species' distribution, ergovaline was constitutively expressed, as predicted where growth is environmentally limited. Our results now present the first evidence, to our knowledge, that ungulate saliva can combat plant defences produced by a grass- endophyte mutualism.yyyy","Tanentzap, AJ; Vicari, M; Bazely, DR",NA,NA,NA,"Tanentzap, Andrew J.; Vicari, Mark; Bazely, Dawn R.",NA,Ungulate saliva inhibits a grass - endophyte mutualism,BIOLOGY LETTERS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Vicari, Mark/KXQ-6136-2024; Bazely, Dawn/H-8260-2013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1744-9561,1744-957X,NA,NA,NA,JUL,2014,10,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1098/rsbl.2014.0460,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2014.0460,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25055816,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000613897900006,NA,3776,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1,,,Presence,"Every plant species examined to date harbors endophytic fungi within its asymptomatic aerial tissues, such that endophytes represent a ubiquitous, yet cryptic, component of terrestrial plant communities. Fungal endophytes associated with leaves of woody angiosperms are especially diverse; yet, fundamental aspects of their interactions with hosts are unknown. In contrast to the relatively species-poor endophytes that are vertically transmitted and act as defensive mutualists of some temperate grasses, the diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angiosperms are thought to contribute little to host defense. Here, we document high diversity, spatial structure, and host affinity among foliar endophytes associated with a tropical tree (Theobroma cacao, Malvaceae) across lowland Panama. We then show that inoculation of endophyte-free leaves with endophytes isolated frequently from naturally infected, asymptomatic hosts significantly decreases both leaf necrosis and leaf mortality when T. cacao seedlings are challenged with a major pathogen (Phytophthora sp.). In contrast to reports of fungal inoculation inducing systemic defense, we found that protection was primarily localized to endophyte-infected tissues. Further, endophyte-mediated protection was greater in mature leaves, which bear less intrinsic defense against fungal pathogens than do young leaves. In vitro studies suggest that host affinity is mediated by leaf chemistry, and that protection may be mediated by direct interactions of endophytes with foliar pathogens. Together, these data demonstrate the capacity of diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angiosperms to play an important but previously unappreciated role in host defense.","Arnold, AE; Mejía, LC; Kyllo, D; Rojas, EI; Maynard, Z; Robbins, N; Herre, EA",NA,NA,NA,"Arnold, AE; Mejía, LC; Kyllo, D; Rojas, EI; Maynard, Z; Robbins, N; Herre, EA",NA,Fungal endophytes limit pathogen damage in a tropical tree,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mejia, Luis/KFR-7315-2024","Mejia, Luis/0000-0003-2135-5241",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0027-8424,1091-6490,NA,NA,NA,23-Dec,2003,100,26,NA,NA,NA,15649,15654,NA,10.1073/pnas.2533483100,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2533483100,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,14671327,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000187554600066,NA,3287,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,

3,,,Presence,"Key requirements for microbes to initiate and establish mutualistic symbiotic interactions with plants are evasion of potential host defense responses and strict control of microbial growth. Reactive oxygen species ( ROS) produced by a specific NADPH oxidase isoform, NoxA, regulate hyphal growth in the mutualistic interaction between the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae and its grass host Lolium perenne. Unlike mammalian systems, little is known about the fungal NADPH oxidase complex and its response to differentiation signals. We identify an E. festucae p(67phox)- like regulator, NoxR, dispensable in culture but essential in planta for the symbiotic interaction. Plants infected with a noxR deletion mutant show severe stunting and premature senescence, whereas hyphae in the meristematic tissues show increased branching leading to increased fungal colonization of pseudostem and leaf blade tissue. Inhibition of ROS production or overexpression of noxR recapitulates the hyperbranching phenotype in culture. NoxR interacts in vitro with the small GTP binding protein RacA and requires a functional RacA binding site to complement the noxR mutant and restore the wild- type plant interaction phenotype. These results show that NoxR is a key regulator of NoxA in symbiosis, where it acts together with RacA to spatially regulate ROS production and control hyphal branching and patterning.","Takemoto, D; Tanaka, A; Scott, B",NA,NA,NA,"Takemoto, Daigo; Tanaka, Aiko; Scott, Barry",NA,A p67<SUP>Phox</SUP>-like regulator is recruited to control hyphal branching in a fungal-grass mutualistic symbiosis,PLANT CELL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tanaka, Aiko/ABG-8351-2020; Scott, David/J-3135-2013","Takemoto, Daigo/0000-0002-9816-7882",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1040-4651,NA,NA,NA,NA,OCT,2006,18,10,NA,NA,NA,2807,2821,NA,10.1105/tpc.106.046169,http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.106.046169,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,17041146,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000241818300029,NA,4781,Absence,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that microorganisms from extreme environments, like those associated with the roots of Antarctica plants, can be good partners to increase the performance of crop plants and to restore endangered native plants. Nothofagus alessandrii and N. glauca, are among the most endangered species of Chile, restricted to a narrow and/or limited distributional range associated mainly to the Maulino forest in Chile. Here we evaluated the effect of the inoculation with a fungal consortium of root endophytes isolated from the Antarctic host plant Colobanthus quitensis on the ecophysiological performance [photosynthesis, water use efficiency (WUE), and growth] of both endangered tree species. We also, tested how Antarctic root-fungal endophytes could affect the potential distribution of N. alessandrii through niche modeling. Additionally, we conducted a transplant experiment recording plant survival on 2 years in order to validate the model. Lastly, to evaluate if inoculation with Antarctic endophytes has negative impacts on native soil microorganisms, we compared the biodiversity of fungi and bacterial in the rhizospheric soil of transplanted individuals of N. alessandrii inoculated and non-inoculated with fungal endophytes. We found that inoculation with root-endophytes produced significant increases in N. alessandrii and N. glauca photosynthetic rates, water use efficiencies and cumulative growth. In N. alessandrii, seedling survival was significantly greater on inoculated plants compared with non-inoculated individuals. For this species, a spatial distribution modeling revealed that, inoculation with root-fungal endophytes could potentially increase the current distributional range by almost threefold. Inoculation with root-fungal endophytes, did not reduce native rhizospheric microbiome diversity. Our results suggest that the studied consortium of Antarctic root-fungal endophytes improve the ecophysiological performance as well as the survival of inoculated trees and can be used as a biotechnological tool for the restoration of endangered tree species.","Torres-Díaz, C; Valladares, MA; Acuña-Rodríguez, IS; Ballesteros, GI; Barrera, A; Atala, C; Molina-Montenegro, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Torres-Diaz, Cristian; Valladares, Moises A.; Acuna-Rodriguez, Ian S.; Ballesteros, Gabriel I.; Barrera, Andrea; Atala, Cristian; Molina-Montenegro, Marco A.",NA,Symbiotic Interaction Enhances the Recovery of Endangered Tree Species in the Fragmented Maulino Forest,FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ballesteros, Gabriel/IAN-7082-2023; Valladares, Moisés/Q-5088-2019; Valladares, Moises A./N-1152-2017","Torres Diaz, Cristian/0000-0002-5741-5288; Valladares, Moises A./0000-0002-0294-174X; Atala, Cristian/0000-0003-1337-9534",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-462X,NA,NA,NA,NA,15-Apr,2021,12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3389/fpls.2021.663017,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.663017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33936153,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000645024100001,NA,1425,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,

6,,,Review,"The fabaceae are rooted in rosaceae pods known as ""vegetables"" by the early botanists. They are the third family of angiosperms which includes 642 genus divided into about 18,000 species. The fabaceae family is known as the most important family of the ecosystem as it is indispensable in medicine, agriculture, industry and livestock. The Adenocarpus genus has about 50 species that are frequently found in tropical regions of Northern Africa, the southern part of West Europe and in the central and southern Italy. They are used in traditional medicine for the treatment of several diseases: such as microbial infections, leprosy, scabies, acne, malaria and other plants species are used in agriculture as insecticidal properties. Mainly Adenocarpus mannii species is well represented in the tropical regions of North Africa. It occurs in Angola, Mozambique, Malawi, Guinea, South Africa, Tanzania, and Burundi. In Cameroon, it is encountered in South West Region and West Region. Previous phytochemical studies led to the isolation of several classes of compounds such as flavonoids, alkaloids and triterpenes. Several studies report the phytochemical studies on genus Adenocarpus and chemotaxonomic markers of species of this genus. Herein, we outline all the botanical, pharmacological and phytochemical aspects of Adenocarpus mannii.

7,,,Presence,"Wilting of sweet pepper plants is leading to significant yield losses in organic cultivation in glasshouses in the Netherlands. Verticillium dahliae was consistently isolated from affected plants and is known to cause wilting of plants. While sampling sweet pepper plants, root discoloration and damage of the root cortex were observed. Colletotrichum coccodes was isolated from affected roots. To study the co-occurrence and interaction of both pathogens, sweet pepper plants with, and without wilting symptoms were collected from the glasshouse. V. dahliae was only isolated from plants with wilting symptoms, while C. coccodes was also found on symptomless plants. Single or combined inoculations with V. dahliae and C. coccodes were performed on pepper seedlings to study the pathogenicity and the interaction of both pathogens. Symptom development was evaluated and fungal colonization was measured in the roots and stem with real-time PCR. V. dahliae induced stunted growth, while C. coccodes did not induce symptoms on the shoot. C. coccodes reduced root weight when plants grew under suboptimal conditions but under optimal conditions for plant growth, C. coccodes reduced V. dahliae colonization and symptom development. In conclusion, V. dahliae is the causal agent of wilting of pepper plants and C. coccodes is a weak pathogen, with antagonistic or neutral effects on symptom development and colonization by V. dahliae.

Lycoris aurea is another Lycoris species with high galanthamine content. Fungal endophytes can enhance plant secondary metabolite accumulation; thus, we compared the fungal communities in these two Lycoris species to identify certain fungal taxa in L. aurea capable of enhancing galanthamine accumulation. Several fungal endophytes, which were enriched in, exclusively isolated from L. aurea, or showed significant correlations with galanthamine, were demonstrated to enhance the accumulation of only galanthamine but no other Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (AAs) in L. radiata. These fungal endophytes mainly upregulated the downstream genes in the biosynthesis pathways of AAs in L. radiata, suggesting that they may allocate more precursors for galanthamine biosynthesis. This study demonstrated that fungal endophytes from L. aurea with higher galanthamine content can specifically enhance the accumulation of this medicinal alkaloid in other Lycoris species, thereby increasing the galanthamine source and reducing galanthamine separation and purification costs. This study broadens our understanding of the complex interactions between plant secondary metabolites and fungal endophytes.","Wang, ZY; Yuan, J; Wang, R; Xu, S; Zhou, JY",NA,NA,NA,"Wang, Ziying; Yuan, Jie; Wang, Ren; Xu, Sheng; Zhou, Jiayu",NA,Distinct fungal communities affecting opposite galanthamine accumulation patterns in two<i> Lycoris</i> species,MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0944-5013,1618-0623,NA,NA,NA,SEP,2024,286,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1016/j.micres.2024.127791,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2024.127791,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38851007,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001347801500001,NA,4913,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,

10,,,Presence,"Endophytes play an important role in ecological and evolutionary processes in plants and have marked economic value. Seed-transmitted fungal endophytes are conventionally regarded as mutualistic symbionts, but their fitness consequences for the offspring of the host are not clear. Puccinellia distans infected with the fungus Epichloe typhina (E+) produces seeds that are several times smaller than normal (E). This observation suggests that the E+ seedlings face a developmental disadvantage. Our growth chamber experiments compared the germination rates of the small E+ and large E seeds of P.distans and examined the biomass allocation of seedlings to roots and shoots. The E+ seedlings germinated more slowly and maintained shorter shoots and a smaller root biomass for 3050days after sowing. Despite this disadvantage, the E+ plants more quickly increased their total size, attaining a larger shoot and whole-plant biomass. The shoot:root biomass ratio increased more rapidly through time in the E+ seedlings, attaining a value nine times higher in the E+ than the E group 50days after sowing. Such differences between the E+ and E seedlings were not explained by the growth allometry between shoots and roots. The seedlings of P.distans infected with the Epichloe endophyte were initially handicapped by their postponed emergence, but this disadvantage was quickly overcome by their superior growth capacity. The decrease in the relative allocation to roots may indicate that endophytes increase the performance of roots as resource-acquiring organs and/or reduce the role of roots in protection against herbivores.","Czarnoleski, M; Olejniczak, P; Górzynska, K; Kozlowski, J; Lembicz, M",NA,NA,NA,"Czarnoleski, M.; Olejniczak, P.; Gorzynska, K.; Kozlowski, J.; Lembicz, M.",NA,Altered allocation to roots and shoots in the endophyte-infected seedlings of Puccinellia distans (Poaceae),PLANT BIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Górzyńska, Karolina/ABE-7506-2020; Kozlowski, Jan/K-5549-2012; Czarnoleski, Marcin/H-2893-2015","Czarnoleski, Marcin/0000-0003-2645-0360; Lembicz, Marlena/0000-0003-1714-4716; Gorzynska, Karolina/0000-0002-4226-1706; Olejniczak, Pawel/0000-0002-6269-6811; Kozlowski, Jan/0000-0002-7084-2030",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1435-8603,1438-8677,NA,NA,NA,MAR,2013,15,2,NA,NA,NA,264,273,NA,10.1111/j.1438-8677.2012.00633.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1438-8677.2012.00633.x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,22726626,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000314756900002,NA,2483,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,,,Both,"Asexual systemic fungi that live symbiotically within grasses are viewed as strong mutualists on the basis of theory and empirical studies of introduced agronomic grasses. Evolutionary theory predicts that microbial symbionts that lose sexuality and rely on propagules of their hosts for transmission should evolve to benefit their hosts. Fungal endophytes of some cultivated turf and pasture grasses are well known for increasing plant performance and competitive abilities, especially under stress, and increasing resistance to herbivores, pathogens, and root-feeders by virtue of fungal alkaloids. The assumption of mutualism, however, has rarely been tested in native grasses, which often harbor high but variable frequencies of systemic asexual endophytes. We tested the effect of Neotyphodium infections for the native grass Arizona fescue in a 3-yr field experiment. We strictly controlled host genotype and manipulated soil moisture and nutrients. Infection generally decreased host growth in terms of plant volume, number of tillers, and dry mass of shoots and roots. Infected plants also showed decreased reproduction in terms of number and mass of seeds, and the seeds produced by infected plants had lower germination success than plants without their endophytes, suggesting that the negative effects of the symbiont are transferred to the next generation. Plant genotype strongly influenced host's growth and reproduction and interacted with the presence of the endophyte, but the interaction was usually in the direction of negative effects. Our results challenge the notion that systemic asexual endophytes must be plant mutualists for infections to persist in nature. We propose other hypotheses to explain the variable but usually high endophyte frequencies in natural populations of grasses.","Faeth, SH; Sullivan, TJ",NA,NA,NA,"Faeth, SH; Sullivan, TJ",NA,Mutualistic asexual endophytes in a native grass are usually parasitic,AMERICAN NATURALIST,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0003-0147,1537-5323,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2003,161,2,NA,NA,NA,310,325,NA,10.1086/345937,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/345937,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12675375,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000181152300010,NA,989,Absence,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,,,Presence,"Bacterial and fungal endophytes may help their host in terms of improved tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses and enhanced growth. European apple canker, caused by Neonectria ditissima, is widespread in apple-growing regions. Infection by N. ditissima occurs through artificial or natural wounds, including leaf scars, picking wounds, and pruning cuts. Using F-1 progeny trees in an experimental orchard derived from a cross between a canker-susceptible genotype and a canker-tolerant or -resistant genotype, we assessed both bacterial and fungal endophyte communities in apple leaf scars, and determined correlations of endophytes with canker development. All trees were artificially inoculated with an N. ditissima isolate postplanting. Specific components of apple endophytes as well as a number of individual fungal or bacterial groups in leaf scars were partially genetically controlled by host genotypes. Several bacterial groups were significantly correlated with canker-related traits, mostly positively associated with canker tolerance. A few fungal groups may facilitate canker development whereas others may compete with canker. However, most of these microbial groups could not be identified to the species level with confidence; even for those groups which could be assigned to the species level, there is insufficient knowledge about their ecological characteristics in relation to plants. The present results may be used to inform further research using biocontrol to manage N. ditissima and breeding for resistance.","Papp-Rupar, M; Karlstrom, A; Passey, T; Deakin, G; Xu, XM",NA,NA,NA,"Papp-Rupar, Matevz; Karlstrom, Amanda; Passey, Thomas; Deakin, Greg; Xu, Xiangming",NA,The Influence of Host Genotypes on the Endophytes in the Leaf Scar Tissues of Apple Trees and Correlation of the Endophytes with Apple Canker (<i>Neonectria ditissima</i>) Development,PHYTOBIOMES JOURNAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Xu, Xiangming/I-3050-2014","Karlstrom, Amanda/0000-0002-2884-6759; Papp-Rupar, Matevz/0000-0001-6248-685X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2471-2906,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2022,6,2,NA,NA,NA,127,138,NA,10.1094/PBIOMES-10-21-0061-R,http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PBIOMES-10-21-0061-R,NA,22-May,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000799711300003,NA,1370,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,,,Both,"Understanding the dynamics of a hereditary symbiosis requires testing how ecological factors alter not only the fitness consequences of the symbiosis, but also the rate of symbiont transmission to the next generation. The relative importance of these two mechanisms remains unresolved because studies have not simultaneously examined how the ecological context of the symbiosis influences both costs/benefits and the rate of vertical transmission. Fungal endophytes in grasses have provided particularly tractable systems for investigating the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of hereditary symbiosis. Here we examine interactions between a fungal endophyte. Epichloe amarillans, and its grass host, Agrostis hyemalis, under altered abiotic and biotic contexts: a gradient of water availability and in the presence versus absence of soil microbes. We show that benefits of the symbiosis were strongest when water was limiting. Symbiotic plants at the lowest watering level produced similar to 40% more inflorescences and greater seed mass than non-symbiotic plants, while at the highest watering level, symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants did not significantly differ in reproductive fitness. Benefits appear to accrue by allowing hosts to escape from drought, a response that has not been previously reported to be endophyte-mediated. Symbiotic plants at the lowest watering level flowered 9 days earlier than non-symbiotic plants. Interestingly, our results suggest the symbiosis may be costly in the presence of soil microbes, as on live soil, the biomass of symbiotic plants was lower than the biomass of symbiont-free plants. We detected no effect of either the biotic or abiotic context on the rate of symbiont vertical transmission, suggesting that the context-dependent benefits of the symbiosis are the more important driver of variation in symbiont frequency in this system.

(2) Can biochemical or molecular markers be detected to account for the action of ozone? To this end six adult beech trees were chosen, three ozone fumigated (2 x ozone) and three control trees (ambient = 1 x ozone). Spore-sprayed branches of sun and shade crown positions of each of the trees, and uninoculated control branches, were enclosed in 1004 plastic bags for one night to facilitate infection initiation.

Although ingestion of infected plant tissues has detrimental effects on insects, birds, domestic livestock, and laboratory rodents, little is known about the consequences of endophyte consumption for wild rodent consumers. This multigenerational study investigated how consumption of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) seeds infected with the endophytic fungus Acremonium coenophialum affects prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). Breeding pairs were fed one of three base diets: laboratory rodent chow (C; control diet), 50% uninfected tall fescue seeds plus 50% chow (E-), or 50% endophyte-infected seeds plus 50% chow (E+). In the first generation, the E+ diet suppressed food and water intake, growth rates, and reproductive success, so no voles fed on the E+ diet could be followed in the second generation. In general, voles of the two generations performed similarly on the C and E- diets. Our findings show that prairie voles are sensitive to the presence of endophytes, or associated alkaloids, in their diets, and suggest that free-ranging voles avoid consuming endophyte-infected plant tissues if other foods are available.","Durham, WF; Tannenbaum, MG",NA,,NA,"Durham, WF; Tannenbaum, MG",NA,"Effects of endophyte consumption on food intake, growth, and reproduction in prairie voles",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,,,,NA,,Acremonium coenophialum; Festuca arundinacea; Microtus ochrogaster; endophyte; food intake; growth response; herbivory; reproduction; rodent,"Durham W.F., Division of Science, Truman State University, Kirksville, MO 63501, United States; Tannenbaum M.G., Division of Science, Truman State University, Kirksville, MO 63501, United States","Division of Science, Truman State University, Kirksville, MO 63501, United States","M.G.

Mycelial development and stromata formation on host plants is suggested to be in part regulated by sugar concentration. Atkinsonella hypoxylon and B. epichloe were shown to colonize wax droplets, suggesting that these species may gain some energy for stroma formation from the waxy cuticle present superficially on grass plants. Most members of the Balansieae demonstrated colonization of oil droplets and protein hydrolysis capacity, the significance of which is undetermined.","WHITE, JF; BREEN, JP; MORGANJONES, G",NA,NA,NA,"WHITE, JF; BREEN, JP; MORGANJONES, G",NA,"SUBSTRATE UTILIZATION IN SELECTED ACREMONIUM, ATKINSONELLA AND BALANSIA SPECIES",MYCOLOGIA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"White, James/C-2280-2009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0027-5514,1557-2536,NA,NA,NA,SEP-OCT,1991,83,5,NA,NA,NA,601,610,NA,10.2307/3760215,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3760215,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1991GQ09700008,NA,4098,Absence,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Root colter cells of fourwing saltbush in arid rangelands of the southwestern United States were analyzed and found to be regularly colonized with three types of endophytic fungi: septate, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM), and Chytridiomycetes. Septate fungi were 2.7 times more prevalent than VAM and formed intimate non-pathogenic associations characterized by inter- and intracellular hyphae, coils, microsclerotia, and occasional labyrinthine or ''Hartig net'' structures similar to those affiliated with ectendomycorrhizae. External hyphae formed intimate associations with soil and sand particles. Typically, VAM were characterized by hyphae, vesicles, and (at times) coils. VAM were 2.2 times more prevalent than chytrids. Chytrids were rather common and were expressed as resting and active sporangia found within root cortex cells. The widespread occurrence of these non-destructive fungal associations with plants implies that they have an important role in plant survival in arid environments.","Barrow, JR; Havstad, KM; McCaslin, BD",NA,NA,NA,"Barrow, JR; Havstad, KM; McCaslin, BD",NA,"Fungal root endophytes in fourwing saltbush, Atriplex canescens, on arid rangelands of southwestern USA",ARID SOIL RESEARCH AND REHABILITATION,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0890-3069,NA,NA,NA,NA,APR-JUN,1997,11,2,NA,NA,NA,177,185,NA,10.1080/15324989709381470,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15324989709381470,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1997XD31700006,NA,8595,Absence,,,,,,,,,,,,,
19,,,Both,"Dollar spot disease, caused by the fungal pathogen Clarireedia jacksonii, is a major problem in many turfgrass species, particularly creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera). It is well-established that strong creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra subsp. rubra) exhibits good dollar spot resistance when infected by the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae. This endophyte-mediated disease resistance is unique to the fine fescues and has not been observed in other grass species infected with other Epichloe spp. The mechanism underlying the unique endophyte-mediated disease resistance in strong creeping red fescue has not yet been established. We pursued the possibility that it may be due to the presence of an abundant secreted antifungal protein produced by E. festucae. Here, we compare the activity of the antifungal protein expressed in Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris, and Penicillium chrysogenum. Active protein was recovered from all systems, with the best activity being from Pe. chrysogenum. In greenhouse assays, topical application of the purified antifungal protein to creeping bentgrass and endophyte-free strong creeping red fescue protected the plants from developing severe symptoms caused by C. jacksonii. These results support the hypothesis that Efe-AfpA is a major contributor to the dollar spot resistance observed with E. festucae-infected strong creeping red fescue in the field, and that this protein could be developed as an alternative or complement to fungicides for the management of this disease on turfgrasses.","Fardella, PA; Tian, ZP; Clarke, BB; Belanger, FC",NA,NA,NA,"Fardella, Patrick A.; Tian, Zipeng; Clarke, Bruce B.; Belanger, Faith C.",NA,"The <i>Epichloe festucae</i> Antifungal Protein <i>Efe</i>-AfpA Protects Creeping Bentgrass (<i>Agrostis stolonifera</i>) from the Plant Pathogen <i>Clarireedia jacksonii</i>, the Causal Agent of Dollar Spot Disease",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Belanger, Faith/0000-0002-8725-0824",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2309-608X,NA,NA,NA,OCT,2022,8,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3390/jof8101097,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof8101097,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36294663,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000873026400001,NA,2143,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,
20,,,Other,"Plants are colonized various microorganisms including endophytes. These microbes can play an important role in agricultural production as they promote plant growth and/or enhance the resistance of their host plant against diseases and environmental stress conditions. Although culture-independent molecular approaches such as DNA barcoding have greatly enhanced our understanding of bacterial and fungal endophyte communities, there are some methodical problems when investigating endophyte diversity. One main issue are sequence contaminations such as plastid-derived rRNA gene sequences which are co-amplified due to their high homology to bacterial 16S rRNA genes. The same is true for plant and fungal ITS sequences. The application of highly specific-primers suppressing co-amplification of these sequence contaminations is a good solution for this issue. Here, we describe a detailed protocol for assessing bacterial and fungal endophyte diversity in plants using these primers in combination with next-generation sequencing.","Wemheuer, B; Wemheuer, F",NA,"Streit, WR; Daniel, R",NA,"Wemheuer, Bernd; Wemheuer, Franziska",NA,Assessing Bacterial and Fungal Diversity in the Plant Endosphere,"METAGENOMICS: METHODS AND PROTOCOLS, 2ND EDITION",Methods in Molecular Biology,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1064-3745,1940-6029,978-1-4939-6691-2; 978-1-4939-6689-9,NA,NA,NA,2017,1539,NA,NA,NA,NA,75,84,NA,10.1007/978-1-4939-6691-2_6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-6691-2_6,10.1007/978-1-4939-6691-2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27900685,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000412190900007,NA,6167,Absence,,,,,,,,,,,,,
21,,,Review,"This chapter answers the questions what, how, where, when, and who of measuring Neotyphodium oenophialum (Morgan-Jones and Gams) Glenn, Bacon, and Hanlin endophyte in tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceaum (Schreb.) Darbysh.]. Analysis is a technical procedure that usually is performed on samples collected from the field and sent to a laboratory. The most common description of endophyte infection is the proportion of tillers in a field that have endophyte present. The availability of new detection options allows measurement with relatively simple laboratory equipment. The commercial availability of nontoxic novel endophytes in tall fescue is making the detection of endophytes and determination of their toxic potential complex. This is due to the need for the analysis to distinguish those plants with endophytes that are producing toxic alkaloids from those plants with endophytes that are producing nontoxic alkaloids. Guidelines for sampling endophyte in tall fescue pasture are presented. © 2009 by American Society of Agronomy, Inc. Crop Science Society of America, Inc.

22,,,Presence,"The root fungal endophyte Piriformospora indica promotes the growth and survival of plants belonging to a number of species when exposed to various abiotic stresses, including drought, a major constraint of crop productivity. The application of 'omics technologies has revealed much of the molecular basis of the plant drought stress response. Here, the proteomic and metabolomic response of the leaves of moisture-stressed barley plants inoculated with P. indica was characterized. The abundance of 145 proteins was altered by the imposition of moderate drought on plants inoculated by P. indica, as was that of 104 in non-inoculated plants, while an episode of more severe stress altered the content of, respectively, 144 and 462 proteins. Many of these responsive proteins were involved in the plant's primary metabolism, in particular acting to mitigate the damage caused by oxidative stress. Colonization of the roots by P. indica enhanced the activity of both the photosystem and the electron transfer chain, and also promoted the accumulation of proteins protective of photorespiration, energy modulation, primary metabolism, transporters and autophagy. The beneficial effect of P. indica colonization on autophagy in plants exposed to stress may relate to alterations in the host's amino acid metabolism.","Ghaffari, MR; Mirzaei, M; Ghabooli, M; Khatabi, B; Wu, YQ; Zabet-Moghaddam, M; Moharnmadi-Nejad, G; Haynes, PA; Hajirezaei, MR; Sepehri, M; Salekdeh, GH",NA,NA,NA,"Ghaffari, Mohammad Reza; Mirzaei, Mehdi; Ghabooli, Mehdi; Khatabi, Behnam; Wu, Yunqi; Zabet-Moghaddam, Masoud; Moharnmadi-Nejad, Ghasem; Haynes, Paul A.; Hajirezaei, Mohammad Reza; Sepehri, Mozhgan; Salekdeh, Ghasem Hosseini",NA,Root endophytic fungus <i>Piriformospora indica</i> improves drought stress adaptation in barley by metabolic and proteomic reprogramming,ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mirzaei, Mohammad/S-3198-2017; Ghabooli, Mehdi/K-3365-2019; Salekdeh, Ghasem/E-4198-2012; ghaffari, mohammad/B-7840-2019; Ghaffari, Mohammad Reza/KII-4990-2024","Mohammadi-Nejad, Ghasem/0000-0002-5767-9734; mirzaei, mahdi/0000-0001-9817-9157; Haynes, Paul/0000-0003-1472-8249; Ghaffari, Mohammad Reza/0000-0002-7139-8613; Salekdeh, Ghasem Hosseini/0000-0002-5124-4721; Sepehri, Mozhgan/0000-0003-1190-9407; Ghabooli, Mehdi/0000-0002-6173-7327; Mirzaei, Mehdi/0000-0001-8727-4984",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0098-8472,1873-7307,NA,NA,NA,JAN,2019,157,NA,NA,NA,NA,197,210,NA,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.10.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.10.002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000454465500020,NA,8300,Absence,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we performed a broad scale survey data to study whether the distribution patterns and the incidence of vertically-transmitted endophytes in populations of two native grasses from South-America, Poa lanuginosa Poir. and Poa bonariensis (Lam.) Kunth., are associated with environmental characteristics. We also characterized the endophytes from different populations to establish if the genotype of the endophytes is also correlated with environmental variables. The incidence of endophytes ranged from 0 to 100 % in both host species. In P. lanuginosa, endophytes were only found in populations on sandy coastal dunes and their incidence was positively associated with winter regime rainfall and soil water availability in the growing season. In P. bonariensis, endophytes were only found in populations in xerophytic forests and their incidence was highly associated with plant community. The distributions of infested populations suggested that the endophytes are not found in those areas with the most favorable or most stressing growth conditions accordingly to climatic or edaphical characteristics. Only the vertically transmitted hybrid endophyte species Neotyphodium tembladerae was detected in both host species. Under the hypothesis of vertical transmission, these results suggested that the endophyte should have been lost in endophyte free populations but is maintained in populations established in environments presenting moderate stress as salinity or short drought periods.","Iannone, LJ; Mc Cargo, PD; Giussani, LM; Schardl, CL",NA,NA,NA,"Iannone, Leopoldo J.; Mc Cargo, Patricia D.; Giussani, Liliana M.; Schardl, Christopher L.",NA,Geographic distribution patterns of vertically transmitted endophytes in two native grasses in Argentina,SYMBIOSIS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Giussani, Liliana/GQQ-1964-2022; Schardl, Christopher/P-5655-2014","Giussani, Liliana Monica/0000-0002-4883-4034; Schardl, Christopher/0000-0003-2197-0842",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0334-5114,1878-7665,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2013,59,2,NA,NA,NA,99,110,NA,10.1007/s13199-012-0214-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-012-0214-y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000316971300004,NA,7877,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we examined geographic patterns of polyploidy and the frequency of fungal endophyte colonized plants in 29 Festuca rubra L. populations from eight geographic sites across latitudes from Spain to northernmost Finland and Greenland. Ploidy seemed to be positively and negatively correlated with latitude and productivity, respectively. However, the correlations were nonlinear; 84% of the plants were hexaploids (2n = 6x = 42), and the positive correlation between ploidy level and latitude is the result of only four populations skewing the data. In the southern-most end of the gradient 86% of the plants were tetraploids (2n = 4x = 28), whereas in the northernmost end of the gradient one population had only octoploid plants (2n = 8x = 56). Endophytes were detected in 22 out of the 29 populations. Endophyte frequencies varied among geographic sites, and populations and habitats within geographic sites irrespective of ploidy, latitude or productivity. The highest overall endophyte frequencies were found in the southernmost end of the gradient, Spain, where 69% of plants harbored endophytes. In northern Finland, endophytes were detected in 30% of grasses but endophyte frequencies varied among populations from 0% to 75%, being higher in meadows compared to riverbanks. The endophytes were detected in 36%, 30% and 27% of the plants in Faroe Islands, Iceland and Switzerland, respectively. Practically all examined plants collected from southern Finland and Greenland were endophyte-free, whereas in other geographic sites endophyte frequencies were highly variable among populations. Common to all populations with high endophyte frequencies is heavy vertebrate grazing. We propose that the detected endophyte frequencies and ploidy levels mirror past distribution history of F. rubra after the last glaciation period, and local adaptations to past or prevailing selection forces such as vertebrate grazing.","Dirihan, S; Helander, M; Väre, H; Gundel, PE; Garibaldi, LA; Irisarri, JGN; Saloniemi, I; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Dirihan, Serdar; Helander, Marjo; Vare, Henry; Gundel, Pedro E.; Garibaldi, Lucas A.; Irisarri, J.

Within the phytobiome, the microbiome consists of the microorganisms associated with the plants comprising the endophytes and epiphytes. Endophytes are microorganisms, mainly consisting of bacteria and fungi, which colonise internal plant tissues without causing any disease symptom or tissue damage in different hosts. All these organisms associated to the plant contribute to its fitness. In this article, we revised a total of 103 studies containing the terms phytobiomes and microbiomes and endophytes, with the aims of reviewing: (i) the evolution of the term endophyte and the evolution of the endophyte condition; (ii) the current literature on studies considering the endophyte community within phytobiomes; and (iii) the literature on the bacteria living in fungal endophytes. In our analyses, we highlighted the biases that have been introduced in the phytobiomes' studies. For example, the presence of endohyphal bacteria could have contributed to overestimating the number of bacterial endophytes in the scientific literature.

However, this trend was reversed over time with stands of perennial ryegrass having more bare ground, more weed cover, and less turfgrass cover compared to stands of tall fescue after four years. The influence of endophyte infection was much weaker than predicted having a significant negative influence only on cover by one weed species, Cerastium vulgatum. Results indicated that grass species and fungal endophyte infection may influence patterns of weed occurrence in low maintenance lawns, although the influence of grass species is likely far more important in this regard.

Plants rely upon both nitrogen and phosphorous, for essential growth processes, and are often provided by mycorrhizal fungi. In this study, we investigated the cellular proteome of Serendipita vermifera MAFF305830 and closely related Serendipita vermifera subsp. bescii NFPB0129 grown in vitro under (N) ammonium and (P) phosphate starvation conditions. Mycelial growth pattern was documented under these conditions to correlate growth-specific responses to nutrient starvation. We found that N-starvation accelerated hyphal radial growth, whereas P-starvation accelerated hyphal branching. Additionally, P-starvation triggers an integrated starvation response leading to remodelling of lipid metabolism. Higher abundance of an ammonium transporter known to serve as both an ammonium sensor and stimulator of hyphal growth was detected under N-starvation. Additionally, N-starvation led to strong up-regulation of nitrate, amino acid, peptide, and urea transporters, along with several proteins predicted to have peptidase activity. Taken together, our finding suggests S. bescii and S. vermifera have the metabolic capacity for nitrogen assimilation from organic forms of N compounds.

In B. eriopoda (black grama), significant increases in plant biomass were not observed. However, early plant heights and crown diameters, establishment rates, and stolon production were higher in some callus treatments. In S. cryptandrus (sand dropseed), all variables were positively influenced by one or more of the endophyte treatments. Biomass increases ranged from 2.5- to threefold over untreated plants, and harvested seed increased 5.9-fold in plants treated with endophytes from A. canescens (fourwing saltbush).

Chromosome counts of the dwarfs are identical to typical smooth cordgrass (2n = 62), and smooth cordgrass-specific random amplified DNA markers confirm the species identity of the dwarf. Field collected clonal fragments of the dwarf grown for 2 yr under high-nutrient conditions maintained the dwarf syndrome, as did plants grown from the seed of a dwarf. The dwarf condition is not caused by endophytic fungi. The first dwarf smooth cordgrass patch was discovered in 1991, and by 1996 five separate dwarf patches had appeared within 200 m of the original. Since 1991, total area covered by the dwarf ecotype has increased sixfold to 140 m(2). The ecological range of the dwarf smooth cordgrass ecotype is similar to that of S. patens, a competitor on the Atlantic coast.

Our results suggest that, alongside factors such as climate, soil, and vegetation properties, root colonization by ectomycorrhizal, arbuscular mycorrhizal, and dark septate endophytic fungi also shapes tree-associated microbiomes. Notably, the structure of root and soil microbiomes across our sites ismore strongly and consistently associated with dark septate endophyte colonization than with mycorrhizal colonization and many abiotic factors. Root colonization by dark septate endophytes also has a consistent negative association with the relative abundance and diversity of nutrient cycling genes.

Each plant compartment usually represents a unique ecological niche hosting a distinct microbial community and niche differentiation, which may mirror distinct functions of a specialized microbiota, has been mainly investigated for bacteria. Far less is known for the fungal components of the plant-associated microbiota. Here, we applied a metabarcoding approach to describe the fungal assemblages in different organs of Vaccinium myrtillus plants (Ericaceae) collected in a subalpine meadow in North-West Italy, and identified specific taxa enriched in internal tissues of roots, stems, leaves and flowers. We also traced the distribution of some important fungi commonly associated with plants of the family Ericaceae, namely the ericoid mycorrhizal (ErM) fungi and the dark septate endophytes (DSE), both playing important roles in plant growth and health. Operational taxonomic units attributed to established ErM fungal species in the genus Hyaloscypha and to DSE species in the Phialocephala-Acephala applanata complex (PAC) were found in all the plant organs. Mycorrhizal fungi are thought to be strictly associated with the plant roots, and this first observation of ErM fungi in the above-ground organs of the host plant may be explained by the evolutionary closeness of ErM fungi in the genus Hyaloscypha with non mycorrhizal fungal endophytes. This is also witnessed by the closer similarities of the ErM fungal genomes with the genomes of plant endophytes than with those of other mycorrhizal fungi, such as arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal fungi.","Daghino, S; Martino, E; Voyron, S; Perotto, S",NA,NA,NA,"Daghino, Stefania; Martino, Elena; Voyron, Samuele; Perotto, Silvia",NA,Metabarcoding of fungal assemblages in <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> endosphere suggests colonization of above-ground organs by some ericoid mycorrhizal and DSE fungi,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Martino, Elena/KJD-5112-2024; Daghino, Stefania/AAO-7718-2021; VOYRON, Samuele/ABG-2929-2020","DAGHINO, Stefania/0000-0001-5722-1558",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2045-2322,NA,NA,NA,NA,30-Jun,2022,12,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1038/s41598-022-15154-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-15154-1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35773465,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001014944000039,NA,6215,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,,,Both,"Background. Plants possess a sophisticated immune system to defend from herbivores. These defence responses are regulated by plant hormones including salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA). Sometimes, plant defences can be complemented by the presence of symbiotic microorganisms. A remarkable example of this are grasses establishing symbiotic associations with Epichloe fungal endophytes. We studied the level of resistance provided by the grass' defence hormones, and that provided by Epichloe fungal endophytes, against an introduced herbivore aphid. These fungi protect their hosts against herbivores by producing bioactive alkaloids. We hypothesized that either the presence of fungal endophytes or the induction of the plant salicylic acid (SA) defence pathway would enhance the level of resistance of the grass to the aphid. Methods. Lolium multiflorum plants, with and without the fungal endophyte Epichloe occultans, were subjected to an exogenous application of SA followed by a challenge with the aphid, Sipha maydis. Results. Our results indicate that neither the presence of E. occultans nor the induction of the plant's SA pathway regulate S. maydis populations. However, endophytesymbiotic plants may have been more tolerant to the aphid feeding because these plants produced more aboveground biomass. We suggest that this insect insensitivity could be explained by a combination between the ineffectiveness of the specific alkaloids produced by E. occultans in controlling S. maydis aphids and the capacity of this herbivore to deal with hormone-dependent defences of L. multiflorum.","Bastías, DA; Martínez-Ghersa, MA; Newman, JA; Card, SD; Mace, WJ; Gundel, PE",NA,NA,NA,"Bastias, Daniel A.; Alejandra Martinez-Ghersa, Maria; Newman, Jonathan A.; Card, Stuart D.; Mace, Wade J.; Gundel, Pedro E.",NA,<i>Sipha maydis</i> sensitivity to defences of <i>Lolium multiflorum</i> and its endophytic fungus <i>Epichloe</i> occultans,PEERJ,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Bastias, Daniel/AFN-3093-2022; Newman, Jonathan/A-5932-2008","Bastias, Daniel A./0000-0002-0522-5538; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Card, Stuart/0000-0001-7140-7471; Newman, Jonathan/0000-0003-3155-4084",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2167-8359,NA,NA,NA,NA,18-Dec,2019,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.7717/peerj.8257,http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8257,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31976166,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000503384400005,NA,1165,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,

42,,,Review,"Fungal endophytes of tropical trees are expected to be exceptionally species rich as a consequence of high tree diversity in the tropics and the purported host restriction among the endophytes. Based on this premise, endophytes have been regarded as a focal group for estimating fungal numbers because their possible hyperdiverse nature would reflect significantly global fungal diversity. We present our consolidated ten-year work on 75 dicotyledonous tree hosts belonging to 33 families and growing in three different types of tropical forests of the NBR in the Western Ghats, southern India. We conclude that endophyte diversity in these forests is limited due to loose host affiliations among endophytes. Some endophytes have a wide host range and colonize taxonomically disparate hosts suggesting adaptations in them to counter a variety of defense chemicals in their hosts. Furthermore, such polyphagous endophytes dominate the endophyte assemblages of different tree hosts. Individual leaves may be densely colonized but only by a few endophyte species. It appears that the environment (the type of forest in this case) has a larger role in determining the endophyte assemblage of a plant host than the taxonomy of the host plant. Thus, different tropical plant communities have to be studied for their endophyte diversity to test the generalization that endophytes are hyperdiverse in the tropics, estimate their true species richness, and use them as a predictor group for more accurate assessment of global fungal diversity.","Suryanarayanan, TS; Murali, TS; Thirunavukkarasu, N; Rajulu, MBG; Venkatesan, G; Sukumar, R",NA,NA,NA,"Suryanarayanan, T.

Since 2016, forest managers in the southeast United States have reported the increasing scale, frequency, and severity of needle disease outbreaks on the region's principal timber species, loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.). These recent outbreaks are raising concern throughout the region, as needle diseases are not traditionally considered a threat to P. taeda. Lecanosticta acicola (Thum.) Syd., the native causal agent of brown-spot needle blight, has been recovered from some outbreaks. However, the full array of fungi associated with symptoms has not been explored. In this research, P. taeda foliage was collected from affected stands throughout the region and analyzed to identify fungi associated with needle disease symptoms. We employed targeted molecular diagnostics to confirm the presence or absence of L. acicola and DNA metabarcoding to characterize the foliar mycobiome and screen for other potential pathogens. L. acicola was detected among symptomatic needles from multiple states, particularly in western portions of the P. taeda range, but rarely from stands in eastern states. Metabarcoding revealed pathogens in needles and identified associations among pathogenic fungi, differing symptoms (including needle discoloration and necrosis), and signs of fungal fruiting bodies. Additionally, the fungal community of needles varied with patterns of symptom presentation. This study is the first regionwide assessment of fungi associated with recent large-scale needle disease outbreaks on P. taeda and identifies multiple pathogens that warrant further study.","Meinecke, CD; Niyas, AMM; McCarty, E; Quesada, T; Smith, JA; Villari, C",NA,NA,NA,"Meinecke, Colton D.; Niyas, Afaq M.

These inoculum types include spores, infected root fragments, and extramatrical hyphae. Utilizing root observation chambers, detailed observations were made of the growth dynamics of mycorrhizal hyphae from inoculum sources to roots and the subsequent radiation out from individual colonized root segments. There were several types of hyphal architecture classified by whether the external hyphae were entering (infecting) a plant root or developing from the root surface and growing out into the soil matrix. Morphologically, individual hyphal filaments within all architectural types looked quite similar and clear architectural differences could only be identified when distinct sets of interconnected hyphal filaments were studied. The primary hyphal architectural types observed in the soil were classified as runner hyphae, hyphal bridges, absorptive hyphal networks, germ tubes, and infection networks produced by spores and root fragments. The specialized hyphal architectures of these fungal endophytes appear to be linked to the unique function of each hyphal type. Runner hyphae and infection networks from either spores or root fragments were observed to be capable of infecting new root segments. Absorptive hyphal networks were never observed to act as units of infection and were classified as structures primarily involved in the acquisition of soil resources.

In this contribution, the hypothesis of fungal endophytes existence in the plane trees as well as their relationship with morphological characteristics of trees and nutrient elements of leaves were studied in the central part of Iran. The experiment was performed according to an unbalanced completely randomized design. Approximate age and height of plane trees were recorded and then the greenness and visual appearance were evaluated. Healthy shoots and bark pieces were collected and surface sterilized then placed in petri dishes containing PDA. The results showed that endophytes frequency were significantly greater in age-old trees (60.04%) than young ones (39.96%). Endophytes existence had a positive correlation with iron (Fe) and potassium (K) concentrations of the leaves, and trees height and circumference. Also, there was a positive correlation between the presence of fungal endophytes and improved visual appearance of plane trees.

56,,,Presence,"Premise Foliar fungal endophytes vary in their distributions across landscapes or plant host taxa, indicative of specialized ecologies and host specific adaptations. Accounts of specialization, however, depend on the taxonomic breadth and geographic range of the host plants included in each study. A broad region-scale study or deep sampling of diverse potential host species still remains relatively rare but is becoming increasingly possible with high-throughput sequencing. Methods Amplicon sequencing was used to rapidly identify the fungal endophytic community among six pine (Pinus, Pinaceae) species co-occurring across northeastern United States and to test for site and host specialization. We focused on the endophytic genus Lophodermium (Rhytismataceae), whose species' members are thought to specialize on different pine species, to test if amplicon sequencing could rapidly verify previously implied or discover new patterns of host specificity. Results While amplicon sequencing could analyze more samples at greater depths and recover greater numbers of unique Lophodermium taxa than when endophyte communities were surveyed with traditional culturing methods, patterns of specialization were not better supported. This may be because amplicon sequencing can indiscriminately capture non-host specific organisms found incidentally from plant tissues or because we have overestimated host-specificity in the past with biased culturing techniques. Conclusions Amplicon sequencing can quickly identify patterns of host specificity by allowing large-scale surveys but has limitations in quantifying the level of intimacy of these relationships.","Sarver, J; Schultz, E; Apigo, A; Gernandt, DS; Salas-Lizana, R; Oono, R",NA,NA,NA,"Sarver, Jake; Schultz, Ella; Apigo, Austen; Gernandt, David S.; Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo; Oono, Ryoko",NA,Deep sequencing across multiple host species tests pine-endophyte specificity,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo/LCL-2439-2024","Apigo, Austen/0000-0002-2525-0394; Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo/0000-0002-0761-2910; Gernandt, David/0000-0002-3592-994X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0002-9122,1537-2197,NA,NA,NA,JAN,2022,109,1,NA,NA,NA,83,98,NA,10.1002/ajb2.1792,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.1792,NA,22-Jan,NA,NA,NA,NA,34695224,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000743763200001,NA,6314,Absence,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Endophyte richness in C. cereifera was statistically correlated with leaf traits such as water content, the ratio of fresh weight/dry weight and polyphenol/leaf specific weight. Endophyte diversity was also related to spectral vegetation indices of chlorophyll content.

58,,,Presence,"Biological invasions are a threat to ecological communities and ecosystems, yet understanding the processes that mediate invasion and the environmental contexts in which these processes are important remains a challenge. In this study, we investigated how disturbance and biotic interactions with pathogens and microbial symbionts mediate invasion of American beachgrass (Ammophila breviligulata) in early-and late-successional coastal dune habitats. First, we tested the effect of disturbance on biomasses of two exotic beachgrass species (the invading A. breviligulata and the established A. arenaria) and a native beachgrass (Elymus mollis) by growing plants with and without a disturbance manipulation in early-and late-successional habitats. We quantified root colonization by fungal symbionts and infection by plant-parasitic nematodes to determine the effect of potential mutualists and pathogens on plant biomass. Second, we tested whether soil microbes associated with the established A. arenaria mediated A. breviligulata invasion by inoculating potted plants with microbes from early-and late-successional habitat. We found no effect of disturbance on biomass of the invading A. breviligulata or native E. mollis, whereas A. arenaria biomass increased when grown with disturbance. Colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and by fungal endophytes were poor predictors of plant biomass, and plant-parasitic nematodes were infrequently observed. Microbe addition increased belowground biomass of A. breviligulata, but not A. arenaria, compared to control treatments. Overall, our results suggest that A. breviligulata invasion in both the early-and late-successional habitat is mediated by its lack of disturbance dependence and positive effects of soil microbes. These results have important implications for other primary successional systems and contribute to our understanding of how ecological contexts influence invasion processes.","David, AS; May, G; Schmidt, D; Seabloom, EW",NA,NA,NA,"David, Aaron S.; May, Georgiana; Schmidt, Derek; Seabloom, Eric W.",NA,Beachgrass invasion in coastal dunes is mediated by soil microbes and lack of disturbance dependence,ECOSPHERE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Seabloom, Eric/AFT-3729-2022","Seabloom, Eric/0000-0001-6780-9259",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2150-8925,NA,NA,NA,NA,NOV,2016,7,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1002/ecs2.1527,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.1527,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000392207600006,NA,1481,Absence,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the influence of mowing height on the levels of some alkaloids in a greenhouse experiment for two consecutive months. In tall fescue, levels of four of the nine alkaloids, including one presumptive alkaloid, showed increased levels with increasing the mowing height from 2.5 to 7.5 cm. The alkaloids were ergonovine, ergocryptine, perloline methyl ether, and an unidentified alkaloid designated as unknown C. In perennial ryegrass, three out of six alkaloids, perloline methyl ether, chanoclavine, and unknown A, showed similar increases.

60,,,Both,"Induced resistance responses, including fungal endophyte-mediated resistance, have been well studied in both agricultural crops and grass systems. Yet, the effect of these processes and symbionts in forest trees is poorly known. Fungal endophytes have been found in all conifer forest systems examined to date and have been hypothesised to be involved in resistance-mediated responses. However, in the absence of functional studies the influence of these endophytes on the extended phenotype of the host plant is unclear. In this study we demonstrate that fungal endophytes from Pinus monticola were effective at increasing survival in host plants against the exotic pathogen Cronartium ribicola, which is responsible for the devastating disease called white pine blister rust. Seedlings previously inoculated with fungal endophytes lived longer than endophyte-free seedlings and also showed some reduction in white pine blister rust disease severity. This endophyte-mediated resistance was found to be effective over time, indicating persistence, and is hypothesised to be a form of induced resistance. Overall, this suggests fungal endophytes may play a determinative role in the structure of biological communities and could provide a useful alternative or ancillary management tool for combating pests and diseases.

However, PNA clamping has not been applied to the plant ITS region of rRNA gene - a widely accepted fungal marker. By applying PNA clamping technique to ITS amplicon sequencing of the endophytic fungal community of elderberry this study shows that PNA clamping significantly reduces host-plant co-amplification with the universal ITS1/ITS4 primer set. However, PNA clamping in combination with the discriminatory ITS1F/ ITS2 primer set did not improve the metrics of fungal endophyte community ITS amplicon Illumina sequencing.

62,,,Presence,"Monk fruit (Siraitia grosvenorii) is an herbaceous perennial vine of the Cucurbitaceae family cultivated commercially mainly in southern China. There is very little information available about the fungal endophytes in monk fruit. In this study, monk fruit plants were grown from seeds in a research greenhouse at Kwantlen Polytechnic University in British Columbia, Canada to explore the abundance and diversity of their fungal endophytes. Fungal endophytes were isolated from seeds, seedlings, mature monk fruit plants, and fruits, and cultured on potato dextrose agar and water agar media. Isolates were identified by microscopic examination and BLAST comparison of ITS sequences to published sequences in GenBank. At least 150 species of fungal endophytes representing 60 genera and 20 orders were recovered from monk fruit tissues. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was carried out to explore the similarity of fungal communities among roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds based on fungal orders. Our study showed that monk fruit plants are a rich source of fungal endophytes with the greatest abundance and diversity in leaves.

We identified fungal endophytes in aboveground parts and seeds of five plant species at altitudes of 1000-1750 m in the Tatra National Park. Endophytes isolated from them were grouped into morphotypes on the basis of macroscopic features, such as mycelium shape and colour. Isolates representing individual morphotypes were identified using molecular markers ITS1 and ITS2. When comparing species composition, we used Bray-Curtis distance matrices, calculated on the basis of frequency of the given fungal species. We identified 16 species of fungal endophytes. Five taxa were absent from seeds in spite of their occurrence in mother plant leaves. Differences in altitude were not significantly correlated with fungal species composition observed at a given sampling site. There was also no significant correlation between the species composition of leaf and seed mycobiota. This suggests imperfect vertical transmission in the studied plant species.","Wysoczanski, W; Wegrzyn, E; Olejniczak, P; Lembicz, M",NA,NA,NA,"Wysoczanski, Wojciech; Wegrzyn, Ewa; Olejniczak, Pawel; Lembicz, Marlena",NA,Mycobiota diversity and its vertical transmission in plants along an elevation gradient in mountains,FUNGAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Węgrzyn, Ewa/AAK-9834-2020; Wysoczański, Wojciech/GZL-0029-2022","Lembicz, Marlena/0000-0003-1714-4716; Wegrzyn, Ewa/0000-0002-1403-6800; Wysoczanski, Wojciech/0000-0001-6238-4829",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1754-5048,1878-0083,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2023,63,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1016/j.funeco.2023.101244,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funeco.2023.101244,NA,23-Apr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000983258900001,NA,6166,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies suggest facultative fungal endophytes enhance cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) plant defense against insect herbivores and might alter emissions of volatile organic compounds. We tested for changes in emissions of volatile organic compounds using cotton plants treated with facultative fungal endophtytes Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo-Crivelli) Vuillemin strain GHA and Phialemonium inflatum (Burnside) strain TAMU490 in the presence and absence of herbivory. Solid-phase micro-extraction was used to sample static headspace of individual leaves in collection chambers designed specifically for the experiment. Relative abundance of volatile organic compounds was significantly affected by herbivory, but differences caused by treatment with B. bassiana or P. inflatum were not significant. Findings showed our sampling method can be used to assess constitutive and herbivore-induced volatile organic compound profiles from individual leaves, but further studies need to investigate mechanisms underlying facultative fungal endophyte-mediated herbivore resistance in cotton.","Gale, CC; Suh, CPC; Perez, J; Lesne, P; Wilson, C; Kramer, Z; Madamba, C; Sword, GA",NA,NA,NA,"Gale, Cody C.; Suh, Charles P-C; Perez, Jose; Lesne, Pierre; Wilson, Caroline; Kramer, Zoey; Madamba, Christine; Sword, Gregory A.",NA,Sampling Volatile Organic Compounds from Individual Cotton Leaves to Test Effects of Fungal Endophyte Treatments,SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pérez-Naranjo, José/JFT-1427-2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0147-1724,2162-2647,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2021,46,2,NA,NA,NA,299,304,NA,10.3958/059.046.0201,http://dx.doi.org/10.3958/059.046.0201,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000668593900001,NA,3328,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65,,,Both,"Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), an important pasture grass also occurring on semi-natural grasslands. can form a mutualistic association with the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium lolii. The presence of this fungus is known to confer resistance against different insect pests although the occurrence is also associated with ryegrass stagger. a neurological disorder occasionally seen in livestock grazing on endophyte-infected pastures. In breeding context the benefit of this symbiotic association is of interest. Sixty-two Danish locations representing twelve different habitat types were visited and investigated for the occurrence of the perennial ryegrass endophyte. Most habitats were different types of semi-natural grassland. Perennial ryegrass was investigated using tissue print immunoblot to determine N. lolii infection status. Endophytes were found at 77% of the locations, infection ranging from 4 to 82%. The highest infection rates v ere found in communities, which had been grazed or intensively used by the public. This can probably be explained by an enhanced survival of endophyte-infected plants in a plant community where grazing and intensive use are environmental stress factors. The conclusion from these results is that management practice of semi-natural grasslands is considered a driving force toward higher endophyte infection rates in Denmark. The survey additionally provides the first indication that Neotyphodium ryegrass endophytes are widely spread in semi-natural grass communities in Denmark and high levels of infection are not only restricted to Mediterranean regions with summer drought.

However, generalizations about the vulnerability of the forest microbiome to climate change have been challenging due to responses that are often context dependent. Here we apply a risk assessment framework to evaluate microbial community vulnerability to climate change across forest ecosystems. We define factors that determine exposure risk and processes that amplify or buffer sensitivity to change, and describe feedback mechanisms that will modulate this exposure and sensitivity as climatic change progresses. This risk assessment approach unites microbial ecology and forest ecology to develop a more comprehensive understanding of forest vulnerability in the twenty-first century. In this Perspective, the authors develop a risk assessment framework for forest microbiomes under climate change that unites microbial and forest ecology. They define processes that amplify or buffer microbial sensitivity and exposure risk and feedbacks that mediate impacts on microbial communities.","Willing, CE; Pellitier, PT; Van Nuland, ME; Alvarez-Manjarrez, J; Berrios, L; Chin, KN; Villa, LM; Yeam, JJ; Bourque, SD; Tripp, W; Leshyk, VO; Peay, KG",NA,NA,NA,"Willing, C.

67,,,Presence,"We demonstrate that native grass species from coastal and geothermal habitats require symbiotic fungal endophytes for salt and heat tolerance, respectively. Symbiotically conferred stress tolerance is a habitat-specific phenomenon with geothermal endophytes conferring heat but not salt tolerance, and coastal endophytes conferring salt but not heat tolerance. The same fungal species isolated from plants in habitats devoid of salt or heat stress did not confer these stress tolerances. Moreover, fungal endophytes from agricultural crops conferred disease resistance and not salt or heat tolerance. We define habitat-specific, symbiotically-conferred stress tolerance as habitat-adapted symbiosis and hypothesize that it is responsible for the establishment of plants in high-stress habitats. The agricultural, coastal and geothermal plant endophytes also colonized tomato (a model eudicot) and conferred disease, salt and heat tolerance, respectively. In addition, the coastal plant endophyte colonized rice (a model monocot) and conferred salt tolerance. These endophytes have a broad host range encompassing both monocots and eudicots. Interestingly, the endophytes also conferred drought tolerance to plants regardless of the habitat of origin. Abiotic stress tolerance correlated either with a decrease in water consumption or reactive oxygen sensitivity/generation but not to increased osmolyte production. The ability of fungal endophytes to confer stress tolerance to plants may provide a novel strategy for mitigating the impacts of global climate change on agricultural and native plant communities.","Rodriguez, RJ; Henson, J; Van Volkenburgh, E; Hoy, M; Wright, L; Beckwith, F; Kim, YO; Redman, RS",NA,NA,NA,"Rodriguez, Rusty J.; Henson, Joan; Van Volkenburgh, Elizabeth; Hoy, Marshal; Wright, Leesa; Beckwith, Fleur; Kim, Yong-Ok; Redman, Regina S.",NA,Stress tolerance in plants via habitat-adapted symbiosis,ISME JOURNAL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1751-7362,1751-7370,NA,NA,NA,APR,2008,2,4,NA,NA,NA,404,416,NA,10.1038/ismej.2007.106,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2007.106,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18256707,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000255288700006,NA,9290,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,
68,,,Presence,"Increases in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes influence the structure, function, and resilience of Caribbean forests. Trees in such forests harbor diverse fungal endophytes within leaves and roots. Fungal endophytes often are important for plant health and stress responses, but how their communities are impacted by hurricanes is not well known. We measured forest disturbance in Carite State Forest in Puerto Rico ca. 16 months after the passage of Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm. In three sites, each comprising three plots representing a local gradient of hurricane disturbance, we evaluated soil chemistry and used culture-free analyses to measure richness, phylogenetic diversity, and composition of endophyte communities in leaves and roots. We found that endophyte richness did not vary significantly among plant families or as a function of soil chemistry. Instead, leaf endophytes peaked in richness and decreased in phylogenetic diversity at intermediate levels of disturbance. Root endophytes did not show such variation, but both leaf- and root endophyte communities differed in species composition as a function of disturbance across the forest. Locations with less disturbance typically hosted distinctive assemblages of foliar endophytes, whereas more disturbed locations had more regionally homogeneous endophyte communities. Together, our results show that changes in endophyte richness and phylogenetic diversity can be detected in aboveground tissues more than a year after major storms. In turn, pervasive shifts in endophyte community composition both aboveground and belowground suggest a subtle and lasting effect of hurricanes that merits further study, potentially contributing to the promotion of spatially heterogeneous endophyte assemblages at a landscape scale in these diverse island forests.","Carrión, NC; Troche, CL; Arnold, AE",NA,NA,NA,"Carrion, Nicole Colon; Troche, Chad Lozada; Arnold, A.

69,,,Presence,"Locoweeds are Astragalus and Oxytropis species that contain the toxic alkaloid swainsonine. Swainsonine accumulates in all parts of the plant with the highest concentrations found in the above ground parts. A fungal endophyte, Undifilum oxytropis, found in locoweed plant species, is responsible for the synthesis of swainsonine. By using quantitative PCR, the endophyte can be quantified in locoweed species. Endophyte amounts differ between plant parts and in some instances do not mirror the concentrations of swainsonine in the corresponding parts. Two groups of Oxytropis sericea were identified: one that accumulated high concentrations of swainsonine and another where swainsonine was not detected, or concentrations were near the detection threshold. The plants with high swainsonine concentrations had quantitatively higher amounts of endophyte. Alternatively, plants with low or no swainsonine detected had quantitatively lower endophyte amounts. In addition, swainsonine and endophyte concentrations were not distributed uniformly within the same plant when separated into stalks (leaves, scape(s), and flowers/pods). These findings provide evidence as to why plants in the same population accumulate different concentrations of swainsonine, and they have important implications for sampling of locoweed plants.","Cook, D; Gardner, DR; Ralphs, MH; Pfister, JA; Welch, KD; Green, BT",NA,NA,NA,"Cook, Daniel; Gardner, Dale R.; Ralphs, Michael H.; Pfister, James A.; Welch, Kevin D.; Green, Benedict T.",NA,Swainsoninine Concentrations and Endophyte Amounts of Undifilum oxytropis in Different Plant Parts of Oxytropis sericea,JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0098-0331,1573-1561,NA,NA,NA,OCT,2009,35,10,NA,NA,NA,1272,1278,NA,10.1007/s10886-009-9710-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-009-9710-9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19904570,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000272034300014,NA,4883,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,

71,,,Presence,"Plant-associated microbes have been increasingly recognized for influencing host populations, plant communities, and even herbivores and predators. Thus, understanding factors that affect the distribution and abundance of microbial symbioses may be important for predicting the ecological dynamics of communities. Using endophytic fungi-grass symbioses, we explored how intrinsic traits of the symbiosis, specifically transmission mode, may influence symbiont frequencies in host populations. Combining published literature with new field surveys, we compared Epichloe endophytes, which had mixed horizontal and vertical transmission, with Neotyphodium endophytes, which were exclusively vertically transmitted from host plants to seeds. Exclusively vertical transmission should select against pathogenicity because symbionts depend entirely on hosts for reproduction. Across 118 host species, we found that Neotyphodium hosts had 40-130% higher symbiont frequencies than Epichloe hosts. In field surveys, endophyte frequency was positively correlated with the local density of hosts, but only for Epichloe, suggesting that contagiously spread Epichloe may attain higher frequencies when hosts are more abundant. Epichloe endophytes were also more likely than Neotyphodium to have imperfect vertical transmission; thus, hosts may reduce the transmission of more pathogenic symbionts to seeds. Results are consistent with the conclusion that the evolutionary transition to exclusively vertical transmission can alter patterns of symbiont frequency in nature.","Rudgers, JA; Afkhami, ME; Rúa, MA; Davitt, AJ; Hammer, S; Huguet, VM",NA,NA,NA,"Rudgers, Jennifer A.; Afkhami, Michelle E.; Rua, Megan A.; Davitt, Andrew J.; Hammer, Samantha; Huguet, Valerie M.",NA,A fungus among us: broad patterns of endophyte distribution in the grasses,ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rúa, Megan/G-4187-2011","Rua, Megan A./0000-0002-2883-2795",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0012-9658,1939-9170,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2009,90,6,NA,NA,NA,1531,1539,NA,10.1890/08-0116.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-0116.1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19569368,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000266662500014,NA,6117,Both,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72,,,Both,"Exploring the regional pattern of variation in traits driven by symbiotic interactions may provide insights to understand the evolutionary processes that operate over plant populations. Polyploidy, which is associated with fitness improvement, is expected to increase with latitude and altitude. However, it has never been explored in relation with the occurrence of epichloid fungal endophytes in plants. Both, variation in ploidy level and in the incidence of fungal endophytes, are known to occur in species of fine fescues. Here, we surveyed the occurrence of systemic fungal endophytes in natural Festuca vivipara populations in North European islands. In addition, we identified the fungal species associated with this grass and determined the predominant ploidy level for each population. Endophytes were found in four of six, two of three, and one of three populations for Faroe Islands, Iceland and Great Britain, respectively. With an average low incidence level of 15 % in infected populations, there was no relationship between infection level and either latitude or altitude. The phylogenetic analysis based on sequences ITS and the tub2 genes, supports that the endophytic species is EpichloA << festucae, the same as in other fine fescues. We found no variation in ploidy level as all the plants were tetraploid (4X) with 28 chromosomes, a pattern which contrasts with the variation reported in previous antecedents. Our results suggest that apart from low and variable benefits of the endophyte to the plants, there would be a complex dynamics between epichloid endophytes and species of the fine fescue complex which merits further studies.","Gundel, PE; Dirihan, S; Helander, M; Zabalgogeazcoa, I; Väre, H; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, P.

1,,,Presence,"BackgroundTall fescue (Festuca arundinacea [Schreb.], Lolium arundinaceum [Schreb.] Darbysh) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) are important cool-season forage and amenity grasses that have a mutualistic association with an endophytic fungus. Endophytes confer insect and drought resistance to plants but can produce mammalian toxins. Novel endophytes that do not produce mammalian toxins have been introduced to elite cultivars for commercial production. Seed companies need to maintain adequate levels of novel endophytes within the elite forage cultivars. Endophyte detection is performed using immunochemical and molecular techniques because of their speed and reliability. Early detection in seedlings is essential to evaluate the viability of the endophyte within seed lots.MethodsThis research aimed to identify the earliest growth stage in which immunochemical and molecular methods can detect viable endophyte in seedlings of tall fescue cultivars BarOptima (e34), Texoma MaxQII (584), and Jesup MaxQ (542), as well as the perennial ryegrass cultivar Remington (NEA2).ResultsImmunochemical testing detected endophytes in seedlings 14 days after germination (DAG), but the detection rate increased until 42 DAG in some cultivars tested. The molecular marker Tef1exon detected endophytes at a lower rate than the immunochemical method at 28-42 DAG. However, there was insufficient DNA to detect endophytes in 14 DAG seedlings using markers.ConclusionsWe conclude that the most accurate detection of viable endophytes in seedlings was 42 DAG, at which sufficient and consistent endophyte colonization occurred. Many forage grasses have a beneficial fungus living inside them. The presence of this fungus is a necessity to many producers. Knowing when and how to test for it has been a problem in the past. Here, we compare different methods of fungal testing and different time points that will help producers make testing decisions. image","Lee, K; Hill, N; Dela Cerna, C; Missaoui, A",NA,NA,NA,"Lee, Kendall; Hill, Nicholas; Dela Cerna, Chloe; Missaoui, Ali",NA,Determining the earliest growth stage to detect the presence of endophytes in tall fescue and perennial ryegrass seedlings using molecular markers,GRASSLAND RESEARCH,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2097-051X,2770-1743,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2023,2,2,NA,NA,NA,106,111,NA,10.1002/glr2.12053,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/glr2.12053,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001326028700005,NA,1353,Absence,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4,,,Presence,"Non-mycorrhizal but beneficial fungi often mitigate (a)biotic stress-related traits in host plants. The underlying molecular mechanisms are mostly still unknown, as in the interaction between the endophytic growth-promoting soil fungus Mortierella hyalina and Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, abiotic stress in the form of nitrogen (N) deficiency was used to investigate the effects of the fungus on colonized plants. In particular, the hypothesis was investigated that fungal infection could influence N deficiency via an interaction with the high-affinity nitrate transporter NRT2.4, which is induced by N deficiency. For this purpose, Arabidopsis wild-type nrt2.4 knock-out and NRT2.4 reporter lines were grown on media with different nitrate concentrations with or without M. hyalina colonization. We used chemical analysis methods to determine the amino acids and phytohormones. Experimental evidence suggests that the fungus does not modulate NRT2.4 expression under N starvation. Instead, M. hyalina alleviates N starvation in other ways: The fungus supplies nitrogen (N-15) to the N-starved plant. The presence of the fungus restores the plants' amino acid homeostasis, which was out of balance due to N deficiency, and causes a strong accumulation of branched-chain amino acids. We conclude that the plant does not need to invest in defense and resources for growth are maintained, which in turn benefits the fungus, suggesting that this interaction should be considered a mutualistic symbiosis.","Svietlova, N; Reichelt, M; Zhyr, L; Majumder, A; Scholz, SS; Grabe, V; Krapp, A; Oelmüller, R; Mithöfer, A",NA,NA,NA,"Svietlova, Nataliia; Reichelt, Michael; Zhyr, Liza; Majumder, Anindya; Scholz, Sandra S.; Grabe, Veit; Krapp, Anne; Oelmueller, Ralf; Mithoefer, Axel",NA,The Beneficial Fungus <i>Mortierella hyalina</i> Modulates Amino Acid Homeostasis in Arabidopsis under Nitrogen Starvation,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Krapp, Anne/E-8372-2013; Reichelt, Michael/JFA-0200-2023","Grabe, Veit/0000-0002-0736-2771; Krapp, Anne/0000-0003-2034-5615; Mithofer, Axel/0000-0001-5229-6913; Reichelt, Michael/0000-0002-6691-6500",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1661-6596,1422-0067,NA,NA,NA,NOV,2023,24,22,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3390/ijms242216128,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms242216128,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38003319,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001114555600001,NA,5386,Absence,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The foliage of tea, the marketable part of the plant, is attacked by tortricid moths, hemipterans, and coleopterans. Although Bacillus thuringiensis is the most used microbial control agent of lepidopteran pests of tea, considerable research has been conducted on entomopathogenic viruses, mostly Baculoviruses, for their control and entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) as microbial control agents of hemipteran pests. Coffee plants are attacked by a broad range of insect and mite pests including coleopterans, lepidopterans, hemipterans, and mites. Among these, the coffee berry borer (CBB) is the most economically important pest of coffee worldwide. The EPF, Beauveria bassiana, has been used along with other interventions for its control in Colombia. Exploitation of the endophytic fungi associated with coffee as possible control agents of CBB is discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Nakai M.; Lacey L.A.,NA,,NA,"Nakai, M.

The genomes of three exotic viruses were determined: two potyviruses, Bean yellow mosaic virus and Ornithogalum mosaic virus, and the polerovirus Turnip yellows virus. The genomes of five indigenous viruses were detected, including four novel species. They were the potyvirus Blue squill virus A, another potyvirus, two proposed capilloviruses, and a partitivirus. Partitivirus infection is of interest as this group of viruses is also associated with endophytic fungi (mycorrhizae) that are necessary for the germination, growth, development of many terrestrial orchids. Sequence divergence data indicate post-European, pre-European, and endemic origins for these viruses via inoculum from introduced and native plants. The implications of the findings of this study for orchid conservation, and particularly reintroduction programs where viruses may be spread inadvertently to wild populations from infected propagation sources, are discussed.

8,,,Presence,"Plant-associated microbes contribute to crop health and resilience, potentially extending or complementing plant traits under abiotic stress. Here we tested a series of hypotheses centered on the fungal mycobiome and bacterial microbiome of field-grown sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), an emerging model crop for drought resilience, which we cultivated under arid conditions. Overall, the sorghum mycobiome and microbiome differed in composition between the exterior and interior of plant tissues, between roots and leaves, and among sorghum genotypes. We did not observe variation in fungal and bacterial endophytes among performance classes of sorghum when water was plentiful, but the root endophytic mycobiome and microbiome both shifted markedly under water limitation, with similar shifts in composition observed among multiple plant genotypes. The root endophytic microbiome of high-performing sorghum was especially responsive to water limitation. Network analysis suggested that water limitation did not directly remodel these root endophytic microbiomes, such that interactions of the microbiome with the host plant, rather than interactions among microbes within the microbiome, may be the most dynamic element of change when water is limited. Overall, our study points to shifts in the prevalence of particular taxa under abiotic stress and suggests that high-performing lines may have distinctive features as substrates or strategies for actively recruiting diverse, abundant, and distinctive microbial communities to roots under water limitation. Such findings are important in the arid lands that frame marginal agriculture today and comprise an increasing proportion of agriculture in a changing world.","Garcia, C; Pauli, D; Plecki, C; Alnasser, H; Rozzi, B; Calleja, S; Arnold, AE",NA,NA,NA,"Garcia, Ciara; Pauli, Duke; Plecki, Caroline; Alnasser, Hesham; Rozzi, Bruno; Calleja, Sebastian; Arnold, A.

10,,,Presence,"This study investigated fungal endophytes in the needles of Norway spruce (Picea abies) cuttings in relation to host tree growth. We also determined the prevalence of endophytes in needles incubated for six months. The cuttings originated from clonal origins showing slow- and fast-growth in long-term field trials but the heritable differences in growth rate were not yet detected among the studied cutting. Endophytes were isolated from surface-sterilized needles with culture-free DNA techniques. No significant differences were observed between endophyte communities of slow- and fast-growing clonal origins. However, the endophyte community correlated with the current growth rate of cuttings suggesting that endophytes reflect short- rather than long-term performance of a host. The concentration of condensed tannins was similar in slow- and fast-growing clonal origins but it showed a negative relationship with endophyte species richness, implying that these secondary compounds may play an important role in spruce tolerance against fungal infections. More than a third of endophyte species were detected in both fresh and decomposing needles, indicating that many needle endophytes are facultative saprotrophs. Several potentially pathogenic fungal species were also found within the community of saprotrophic endophytes. © 2014 The British Mycological Society.",Rajala T.; Velmala S.M.; Vesala R.; Smolander A.; Pennanen T.,NA,,NA,"Rajala, Tiina (55041396000); Velmala, Sannakajsa M.

The goal was to develop a model that can identify and characterise risk, and quantify the level of risk. Our model takes a binary approach, either categorising risk into 'acceptable' or ` unacceptable' levels, as regulators are often left with a choice of approving or declining a proposal when an organism is unable to be contained after it is released. This model provides a framework for practitioners to use in order to identify and quantify the risks and benefits to be derived from endophytes and plants with novel traits systematically. We present two case studies of the model in practice in New Zealand legislation under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms (HSNO) Act, and indicate how the model might be used by researchers and regulators to allow for the safe introduction of new traits for biocontrol.","Bromfield, KE; Corin, S; Atapattu, A",NA,NA,NA,"Bromfield, Kate E.; Corin, Steven; Atapattu, Asela",NA,A qualitative binary risk assessment model for regulating the biosecurity and environmental risk of endophytes,BIOLOGICAL CONTROL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1049-9644,1090-2112,NA,NA,NA,JAN,2018,116,NA,NA,NA,NA,46,52,NA,10.1016/j.biocontrol.2017.05.002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2017.05.002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000417035100007,NA,9288,Absence,,,,,,,,,,,,,

13,,,Other,"Tall fescue toxicosis and other maladies in livestock result from the ingestion of vasoconstrictive ergot alkaloids produced by fungal endophytes associated symbiotically with the grass. In order to facilitate future analyses of grass extracts considered responsible for outbreak of related livestock diseases, we examined the electrospray ionization mass spectra of specific ergot alkaloids under conditions that permit protonation. Our purposes were both to record the spectra with interpretation of mechanisms of fragmentation and to derive commonalities that would allow the prediction of mass spectra of related compounds for which standards were not readily available. With [M + H] + values in parentheses, water-insoluble lysergic acid peptide ergot derivatives ergovaline (m/z 534), ergotamine (m/z 582), ergocornine (m/z 562), ergocryptine (m/z 576) and ergocrystine (m/z 610) exhibited a consistent loss of water (-18 u) from the C-12′ α-hydroxy functionality. Of this group, ergovaline and ergotamine generated an m/z 320 fragment deriving from cleavage of ring E amide and ether functions with retention of the peptide ring system methyl group. Ergocornine, ergocryptine and ergocrystine similarly formed an m/z 348 fragment with retention of isopropyl. These assignments were supported by the lack of similar fragments from the water-soluble ergot ergonovine, which lacks a peptide ring system. Clavine-type ergot alkaloids lysergic acid and lysergol lack any substituents beyond simple ones directly on the C-8 position and, similarly to ergonovine, lack significant fragments at m/z 268, 251 and 225 shared by the peptide ergot alkaloids.

We analyzed the structural and functional changes of the mycobiota and the responses of Pinus contorta in the Lophodermella needle cast pathosystem through metabarcoding and metatranscriptomics. When needles transitioned from asymptomatic to symptomatic, dysbiosis of the mycobiota occurred, but with an enrichment of Lophodermella pathogens. Many pathogenicity-related genes were highly expressed by the mycobiota at the necrotrophic phase, showing an active pathogen response that are absent in asymptomatic needles. This study also revealed that Lophodermella spp. are members of a healthy needle mycobiota that have latent lifestyles suggesting that other pine needle pathogens may have similar biology. Interestingly, Pinus contorta upregulated defense genes in healthy needles, indicating response to fungal recognition, while a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses genes were activated in diseased needles. Further investigation to elucidate the possible antagonistic interplay of other biotic members leading to disease progression and/or suppression is warranted. This study provides insights into microbial interactions in non-model pathosystems and contributes to the development of new forest management strategies against emerging latent pathogens.","Ata, JP; Caballero, JRI; Abdo, Z; Mondo, SJ; Stewart, JE",NA,NA,NA,"Ata, Jessa P.; Caballero, Jorge R.

This study evaluates nonadditive and interactive effects of the FE Acremonium strictum and drought treatment on Atractylodes lancea plantlets. Methods and ResultsBy applying FEs (meristem cultures of At.lancea, fungal inoculation of Ac.strictum and plantlet acclimatization) and drought treatment (regular watering, mild drought, severe drought), a research system of At.lancea ramets under different treatments was established. During 12days of drought treatment, the plantlets' physiological responses and basic growth traits were measured and analysed. Although drought and FE presence affected plantlet traits to differing degrees, the interactive effects of the two were more pronounced. In particular under mild drought treatment, the FE conferred drought tolerance to plantlets by enhancing leaf soluble sugars, proteins, proline and antioxidant enzyme activity; decreasing the degree of plasmalemma oxidation; and increasing the host's abscisic acid level and root:shoot ratio. When exposed to regular watering or severe drought, these effects were not significant. ConclusionsPlant traits plasticity was conferred by dual effects of drought stress and FEs, and these factors are interactive. Although FEs can help plants cope with drought stress, the beneficial effects are strictly constrained by drought degree. Significance and Impact of the StudyDuring finite environmental stress, FEs can benefit plants, and for this reason, they may alleviate the effects of climate change on plants. However, because the benefits of FEs are highly context dependent, the role of FEs in a changing background should be re-assessed.","Yang, T; Ma, S; Dai, CC",NA,NA,NA,"Yang, T.; Ma, S.; Dai, C.

Methods and ResultsChanges in the density and localization of N.uncinatum and N-formylloline in N.uncinatum-infected Italian ryegrass were examined by real-time PCR and gas chromatography, respectively. Neotyphodium uncinatum multiplied on pseudostems at the flowering stage, and then increased on inflorescences at the ripening stage. On the other hand, N-formylloline accumulated heavily in inflorescences and leaf blades, but lightly in pseudostems at the ripening stage. In field experiments, N.uncinatum-infected Italian ryegrass suppressed the occurrence of Stenotus rubrovittatus, which fed on the inflorescences, but was not effective to Laodelphax striatellus, which do not necessarily prefer a particular plant tissue.

Species-specific primers for A. pullulans and two genetically distinct strains of E. nigrum were designed in variable regions of ITS1 and ITS2. Primer specificity was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using purified DNA from other fungal endophytes that are usually encountered during isolation attempts from grapevine tissues and from several other strains of A. pullulans and E. nigrum isolated from other sources. In order to determine the occurrence of the two endophytes in grapevine plants, DNA was extracted from shoots of 44 grapevines collected in six vineyards from different localities of northeast Italy. Both endophytes were detected and their identity was confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns obtained from reference strains. RFLP analyses confirmed the presence of two E. nigrum strains belonging to different RFLP groups in grapevine.

20,,,Other,"Attenuating the Taxol yield of Aspergillus terreus with the subculturing and storage were the technical challenges that prevent this fungus to be a novel platform for industrial Taxol production. Thus, the objective of this study was to unravel the metabolic machineries of A. terreus associated with attenuation of Taxol productivity, and their restoring potency upon cocultivation with the Podocarpus gracilior microbiome. The Taxol yield of A. terreus was drastically reduced with the fungal subculturing. At the 10th subculture, the yield of Taxol was reduced by four folds (78.2 mu g/l) comparing to the original culture (268 mu g/l), as authenticated from silencing of molecular expression of the Taxol-rate limiting enzymes (GGPPS, TDS, DBAT and BAPT) by qPCR analyses. The visual fading of A. terreus conidial pigmentation with the subculturing, revealing the biosynthetic correlation of melanin and Taxol. The level of intracellular acetyl-CoA influx was reduced sequentially with the fungal subculturing, rationalizing the decreasing on Taxol and melanin yields. Fascinatingly, the Taxol biosynthetic machinery and cellular acetyl-CoA of A. terreus have been completely restored upon addition of 3% surface sterilized leaves of P. gracilior, suggesting the implantation of plant microbiome on re-triggering the molecular machinery of Taxol biosynthesis, their transcriptional factors, and/or increasing the influx of Acetyl-CoA. The expression of the proteins of 74.4, 68.2, 37.1 kDa were exponentially suppressed with A. terreus subculturing, and strongly restored upon addition of P. gracilior leaves, ensuring their profoundly correlation with the molecular expression of Taxol biosynthetic genes. From the proteomic analysis, the restored proteins 74.4 kDa of A. terreus upon addition of P. gracilior leaves were annotated as ribosome biogenesis proteins YTM and microtubule-assembly proteins that belong to WD40 superfamily. Thus, further ongoing studies for molecular cloning and expression of these genes with strong promotors in A. terreus, have been initiated, to construct a novel platform of metabolically stable A. terreus for sustainable Taxol production. Attenuating the Taxol yield of A. terreus with the multiple-culturing and storage might be due to the reduction on main influx of acetyl-CoA, or downregulation of ribosome biogenesis proteins that belong to WD40 protein superfamily.","El-Sayed, ASA; Mohamed, NZ; Safan, S; Yassin, MA; Shaban, L; Shindia, AA; Ali, GS; Sitohy, MZ",NA,NA,NA,"El-Sayed, Ashraf S.

21,,,Other,"Stream ecosystems are affected by multiple abiotic stressors, and species responses to simultaneous stressors may differ from those predicted based on single-stressor responses. Using 12 semi-natural stream channels, we examined the individual and interactive effects of flow level (low or high flow) and addition of fine sediments (grain size <2 mm) on key ecosystem processes (leaf breakdown, algal biomass accrual) and benthic macroinvertebrate and fungal communities. Both stressors had mostly independent effects on biological responses, with sand addition being the more influential of the two. Sand addition decreased algal biomass and microbe-mediated leaf breakdown significantly, whereas invertebrate shredder-mediated breakdown only responded to flow level. Macroinvertebrate community composition responded significantly to both stressors. Fungal biomass decreased and shredder abundance increased when sand was added; thus, organisms at different trophic levels can exhibit highly variable responses to the same stressor. Terrestrial endophytic fungi were abundant in low-flow flumes where leaf mass loss was also highest, indicating that terrestrial endophytes may contribute importantly to leaf decomposition in the aquatic environment. Leaf breakdown rates depended on the identity and abundance of the dominant decomposer species, suggesting that the effects of anthropogenic activities on ecosystem processes may be driven by changes in the abundance of a few key species. The few observed interactive effects were all antagonistic (i.e., less than the sum of the individual effects); for example, increased flow stimulated algal biomass accumulation but this effect was largely cancelled by sand. While our finding that sand and stream flow did not have strong synergistic effects can be considered reassuring for management, future experiments should manipulate these and other human stressors in experiments that run for much longer periods, thus focusing on the long-term impacts of multiple simultaneously operating stressors. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.",Mustonen K.-R.; Mykrä H.; Louhi P.; Markkola A.; Tolkkinen M.; Huusko A.; Alioravainen N.; Lehtinen S.; Muotka T.,NA,,NA,"Mustonen, Kaisa-Riikka (57189442784); Mykrä, Heikki (15925949700); Louhi, Pauliina (18037547400); Markkola, Annamari (7004357278); Tolkkinen, Mikko (54685427500); Huusko, Ari (6701507838); Alioravainen, Nico (55767468100); Lehtinen, Sirkku (57191404865); Muotka, Timo (7003835341)",NA,Sediments and flow have mainly independent effects on multitrophic stream communities and ecosystem functions,Ecological Applications,NA,NA,English,Article,NA,,,,NA,Aquatic fungi; Benthic invertebrates; Decomposition; Ecosystem functions; Flow variability; Multiple stressors; Sand; Sedimentation; Streams,Animals; Biomass; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Finland; Fungi; Geologic Sediments; Invertebrates; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Plant Leaves; Plants; Rivers; Temperature; Water Movements; algae; Fungi; Invertebrata; nitrogen; phosphorus; abiotic factor; abundance; alga; benthos; biomass allocation; community response; decomposition; ecosystem function; environmental stress; flow velocity; fungus; grain size; human activity; macroinvertebrate; sand; sedimentation; stream; trophic level; animal; biomass; chemistry; classification; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; Finland; fungus; invertebrate; physiology; plant; plant leaf; procedures; river; sediment; temperature; water flow,"Mustonen K.-R., Thule Institute, University of Oulu, P.O.

22,,,Other,"This essay considers the political economy of transnational scientific research based on global collection of biota for laboratory manipulation, focusing on a program to develop pest-resistant wheat using fungal endophytes common in a range of wild but closely related grasses. This effort extends long-standing efforts to commoditize living substances of increasing scope and complexity, and it is supported by efforts to collect and preserve biological diversity. The essay explores how imperatives of capital shape biodiversity as a policy category and determine which forms of life are saved, materially altering our records of life on earth. These newly legible and malleable organisms become more perfect commodities, suitable for standardization and transmutation into finance capital. Yet endophytes are also of interest in part because of their resistance to such control, throwing into sharp relief the reductive imperatives of commoditization while also provoking new ways of justifying capital accumulation and flow. This essay questions the extent to which histories of capitalism and science as conjoined projects rooted in the biological species concept can explain contemporary practices of biodiversity preservation and the microbiological research they support. Microbiological research provides new renderings of life on earth that may challenge or reconfigure metaphors and practices common to capitalism and science.","Fullilove, C",NA,NA,NA,"Fullilove, Courtney",NA,Microbiology and the Imperatives of Capital in International Agro-Biodiversity Preservation,OSIRIS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0369-7827,1933-8287,NA,NA,NA,NA,2018,33,1,NA,NA,NA,294,318,NA,10.1086/699993,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/699993,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000448475600015,NA,8500,Absence,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional insecticides are used for control of biting flies on cattle, but safety concerns and the buildup of insecticide resistance indicate the need for alternative control tactics.

Plant genera that have shown repellency and toxicity against horn flies and stable flies include Allium, Azadirachta, Chrysanthemum, Cinnamomum, Cymbopogon, Derris, Eucalyptus, Festuca, Melaleuca, Melinus, Mentha, Nepeta, Nicotiana, Pelargonium, Pogostemon, Ricinus, Rosa, Syzygium, Vitex, and Zyloxanthum. Other botanically based methods for biting fly control have been investigated, such as the use of fatty acids, soybean trypsin inhibitors, and fungal endophytes on forage grasses.

24,,,Presence,"Patterned vegetation growth such as grass rings is found in many arid ecosystems, yet the mechanisms behind their formation are often unknown and have been minimally tested in the field. One explanation is pathogen accumulation in the center of a long-lived plant, which could cause central dieback and the formation of a ring as the plant grows toward pathogen-free soil. We tested this mechanism by comparing the growth of blue grama grass (Bouteloua gracilis) in live and sterilized soils from inside or outside naturally occurring grass rings. Field collected roots from the inner edge of grass rings had higher fungal colonization than roots from the outer edge, suggesting the potential for intensified pathogen interactions on the inside of rings. However, while plants grown in live soils performed worse than those in sterile soils, this pathogenic effect did not differ between soils collected from inside versus outside of grass rings. Further work on the spatial distribution of plant-microbe interactions is needed to confirm their direct role in ring formation. Our findings suggest that soil and root microbes, in addition to known mechanisms such as soil hydrology, potentially promote ring formation of a widespread North American grass species.","Carlton, L; Duncritts, NC; Chung, YA; Rudgers, JA",NA,NA,NA,"Carlton, Lance; Duncritts, Nora C.; Chung, Y.

On the alkaloids front, the consortium, CATDLF5 + CATPS2, maximally enhanced the vindoline content and yield in C. roseus cvs. Prabal and Nirmal during both winter and summer seasons; but different consortia were effective for improving vindoline content and yield in cv. Dhawal during different seasons. Whereas co-inoculation of CATDLF6 + CATPR13 (Choanephora infundibulifera + Paenibacillus sp.) and CATDLF5 + CATPS2 consortium maximally enhanced vindoline content and yield, respectively, in C. roseus cv. Dhawal during winter; but during summer, CATDLF6 + V3 (Choanephora infundibulifera + Micrococcus sp.) maximally increased both vindoline content and yield in C. roseus cv. Dhawal.

Sorghum bicolor is an economically important crop cultivated for grain, fiber, forage, and lately for biofuel, and S.nonagrioides is its main pest in Mediterranean areas. Young sorghum plants were inoculated with the entomopathogens by spraying in the field. Plant water status, chlorophyll concentration, photosynthesis, and transpiration were not affected. Thirty days after endophyte establishment, plants were infested with fourth instars of S.nonagrioides. The endophytes prevented 50-70% of larvae from entering stalks. Larval mortality was 70-100% and tunnel lengths were reduced by 60-87%. Larval infestation resulted in reduced electron transport capacity and net photosynthetic rate, which was ameliorated in the presence of I.fumosorosea and reversed by B.bassiana and M.robertsii. The growth of sorghum was unaffected in all treatments during the experimental period. Beauveria bassiana and M.robertsii can protect sweet sorghum from damage induced by S.nonagrioides under natural environmental conditions without affecting plant physiology and growth.","Mantzoukas, S; Chondrogiannis, C; Grammatikopoulos, G",NA,NA,NA,"Mantzoukas, Spiridon; Chondrogiannis, Christos; Grammatikopoulos, George",NA,Effects of three endophytic entomopathogens on sweet sorghum and on the larvae of the stalk borer <i>Sesamia nonagrioides</i>,ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Chondrogiannis, Christos/ITA-1893-2023; Mantzoukas, Spiros/H-9306-2019","Chondrogiannis, Christos/0000-0003-4586-5537; Mantzoukas, Spiridon/0000-0002-5792-6221",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0013-8703,1570-7458,NA,NA,NA,JAN,2015,154,1,NA,NA,NA,78,87,NA,10.1111/eea.12262,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.12262,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000346487700010,NA,9151,Absence,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While in-depth identification of microbial species in environmental samples is currently achieved by next generation sequencing or microarray techniques, profiling of whole microbial communities can be accomplished via less labor-intensive approaches. We modified the protocol for automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) by targeting length polymorphism of the fungal ITS1 rRNA gene for a rapid diagnostic assessment of fungal community composition and surveyed its application spectrum. The approach allowed for spatial and temporal differentiation among fungal assemblages in soil samples and different plant species, and is therefore particularly useful for environmental screening and monitoring projects.

31,,,Presence,"Fungal symbioses with plants are ubiquitous, ancient, and vital to both ecosystem function and plant health. However, benefits to fungal symbionts are not well explored, especially in non-mycorrhizal fungi. The Foraging Ascomycete hypothesis proposes that some wood-decomposing fungi may shift life-history strategies to endophytism to bridge gaps in time and space between suitable substrates. To test this hypothesis we examine spatial relationships of Xylaria endophytic fungi in the forest canopy with Xylaria decomposer fungi on the forest floor. We sampled for fungi of the genus Xylaria using a spatially explicit sampling scheme in a remote Ecuadorian cloud forest, and concurrently carried out an extensive culture-based sampling of fungal foliar endophytes. We found 36 species of Xylaria in our 0.5ha plot, 31 of which were found to only occur as fruiting bodies. All five species of Xylaria found as endophytes were also found as fruiting bodies. We also tested the relationships of both stages of these fungi to environmental variables. Decomposer fungi were differentiated by species-specific habitat preferences, with three species being found closer to water than expected by chance. In contrast, endophytes displayed no sensitivity to environmental conditions, such as host, moisture, or canopy cover. We found evidence of spatial linkage between life stages in two species. We also demonstrate that direct transmission of endophytes from leaves to woody substrates is possible. These results indicate that endophytism may represent one way for decomposer fungi to escape moisture limitation, and thatendophytic fungi may act as sources of dispersal for decomposer fungi consistent with predictions of the Foraging Ascomycete hypothesis.

En este estudio examinamos las relaciones espaciales entre hongos endofitos del genero Xylaria en el dosel con los miembros descomponedores del mismo genero en el suelo, para probar la hipotesis de que algunos hongos poseen estrategias de historia de vida alternas, alternando entre estadios de vida descomponedores y endofitos para aumentar su dispersion y resistir escasez de recursos, conocida como la Hipotesis del Ascomiceto Forrajero. Muestreamos miembros del genero Xylaria usando un muestreo espacial explicito en un bosque de niebla remoto en Ecuador, y llevamos a cabo un muestreo extensivo de hongos endofitos foliares usando cultivos.

32,,,Both,"Aims Symbiotic relationships between fungal endophytes and grass species are known to increase stress resistance in the grass host; however, there is little evidence to suggest that the positive effects occur early in the grass life cycle. In this study, we explored the effects of the endophyte Epichloe festucae on the growth and survival of Festuca eskia seedlings under drought and frequent cutting stress. Methods Festuca eskia seedlings were collected from the western part of the plant repartition area in a non-symbiotic population located in a mesic and heavily grazed site (W-NS) and from the eastern part in a symbiotic population from a xeric and lightly grazed site (E-S). The E-S population was experimentally freed from its endophyte (E-F). Two greenhouse experiments were conducted to compare growth and survival between the three seedling types under drought stress and frequent cutting. In the first experiment, 126 seedlings per seedling type (n = 378) were grown for 6 weeks under non-limiting conditions before the cessation of watering. After 3 weeks without irrigation, full irrigation was restored for 10 days to measure the survival rate. Leaf length, leaf elongation rate and survival rate were assessed per population. In the second experiment, 156 seedlings per seedling type (n = 468) were grown under non-limiting conditions. All seedlings were cut to 3 cm high, twice a week, during the first month of growth. Leaf elongation and tillering were monitored on 52 seedlings per seedling type. For each type, seedling survival rate was determined by the number of plants alive after 10 days of regrowth, without cutting. Important Findings The drought experiment revealed a phenotypic differentiation to drought in 30 F. eskia populations, suggesting adaptive differentiation: the eastern seedlings showed the highest survival rate. A trade-off between growth and survival was highlighted: the highest drought survival rate was associated with the lowest leaf elongation rate under non-limiting water conditions. Endophyte presence in the eastern population increased seedling drought survival. In contrast, cutting survival rate was similar between W-NS and E-S because the presence of the endophyte increased seedling survival to frequent cutting. However, this positive effect came with a cost: the endophyte reduced seedling tillering rate.","Gibert, A; Hazard, L",NA,NA,NA,"Gibert, Anais; Hazard, Laurent",NA,Endophyte infection of <i>Festuca eskia</i> enhances seedling survival to drought and cutting at the expense of clonal expansion,JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"; Gibert, Anais/E-5005-2018","Hazard, Laurent/0000-0002-0538-8214; Gibert, Anais/0000-0003-2924-2380",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1752-9921,1752-993X,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2011,4,4,NA,NA,NA,201,208,NA,10.1093/jpe/rtr009,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jpe/rtr009,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000298039000002,NA,555,Absence,,,,,,,,,,,,,

34,,,Presence,"Heritable symbionts are often observed at intermediate prevalence within host populations, despite expectations that positive fitness feedbacks should drive beneficial symbionts to fixation. Intermediate prevalence may reflect neutral dynamics of symbionts with weak fitness effects, transient dynamics of symbionts trending towards fixation (or elimination), or a stable intermediate outcome determined by the balance of fitness effects and failed symbiont transmission. Theory suggests that these outcomes should depend on symbiont-conferred demographic effects and vertical transmission efficiency, which may both depend on environmental context. We established experimental populations of winter bent grass Agrostis hyemalis across a range of prevalence of the heritable fungal endophyte Epichloe amarillans. Using irrigation, we elevated the precipitation for half of the populations, which we hypothesized would weaken the benefits of symbiosis. Across two annual transitions, we assayed 5,485 individuals to determine prevalence and censused 954 individuals for demographic (survival, flowering, reproduction and recruitment) and vertical transmission data. We used hierarchical Bayesian models to infer long-run equilibria from short-term changes in symbiont prevalence and estimated demographic vital rates to link individual-level effects to population-level outcomes. We found evidence for all three proposed mechanisms for intermediate symbiont prevalence, but the outcome differed qualitatively across years and precipitation treatments. In the first year, symbionts trended towards fixation under drought conditions but drifted neutrally under elevated precipitation. Fixation likely arose from symbiont-conferred recruitment benefits outweighing reproductive costs under the drought conditions, while elevated precipitation tempered these effects. In the second transition year, we inferred stable intermediate prevalence across both precipitation treatments, which indicated a balance between symbiont conferred recruitment benefits that allowed low-prevalence populations to increase and imperfect transmission that caused high-prevalence populations to decrease. Synthesis. We find support for neutral, transient and stable mechanisms underlying symbiont prevalence, indicating that symbiont prevalence is often pushed and pulled in different directions by the composite outcome of symbiont effects on demographic rates and transmission efficiency, and the way in which these processes respond to environmental context.","Donald, ML; Bohner, TF; Kolis, KM; Shadow, RA; Rudgers, JA; Miller, TEX",NA,NA,NA,"Donald, Marion L.; Bohner, Teresa F.; Kolis, Kory M.; Shadow, R.

Samp.) has undergone a gradual decline during the last decades. The reasons of this decline are not fully understood, but evidence suggests that the quality and quantity of the interactions of holm oaks with the soil microbiota are playing a central role in the resilience of this species. With the aim to test the previous statement as our hypothesis, 9 oak savannah sites (called dehesas from here on) were sampled, in which asymptomatic (healthy) and symptomatic (early stage of decline) trees were interspersed. Using high throughput amplicon sequencing, soil bacterial and fungal biota (called soil microbiota from here on) were sequenced. Our results showed that soil fungal community composition differed between healthy and declining trees whereas bacterial communities did not show significant differences. Specifically, the degree of holm-oak defoliation was negatively correlated to the relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi and fungal endophytes, suggesting a relation between trees' health and soil fungal symbionts. Although our observational study cannot give a final answer to the directionality of the relationships observed, our results support the idea that small changes in symbiont abundance might be causing holm oaks to lose their ability to withstand the strong environmental pressures.","Garrastatxu, J; Odriozola, I; Esteban, R; Encinas-Valero, M; Morais, DK; Vetrovsky, T; Yuste, JC",NA,NA,NA,"Garrastatxu, Jon; Odriozola, Inaki; Esteban, Raquel; Encinas-Valero, Manuel; Morais, Daniel Kumazawa; Vetrovsky, Tomas; Yuste, Jorge Curiel",NA,Fungal symbionts associate with holm oak tree health in declining oak savannas of the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula,APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Encinas Valero, Manuel/GWZ-2055-2022; Odriozola, Iñaki/AAE-2017-2019; Yuste, Jorge/F-1712-2017",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0929-1393,1873-0272,NA,NA,NA,MAR,2024,195,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1016/j.apsoil.2023.105210,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2023.105210,NA,23-Nov,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001166193200001,NA,2034,Absence,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At Banks Island, AM fungi were present and colonized at a high intensity in all specimens of Potentilla hookeriana Lehm. - Potentilla pulchella R.Br., Arnica angustifolia Vahl, and Erigeron uniflorus L. ssp. eriocephalus (Vahl ex Hornen.) Cronq. sampled. The soil collected under these plants showed a high inoculum potential when tested at greenhouse conditions using Plantago lanceolata L. as a bait plant. Occasional occurrence of AM fungi was recorded in Festuca hyperborea Holmen ex Frederiksen, Trisetum spicatum (L.) Richt., and Potentilla hookeriana - Potentilla pulchella at Devon Island. Despite the fact that potential AM plants are present, no AM was found at the two most northern sites, Ellesmere Island and Ellef Ringnes Island. There seems to be climatic or dispersal limitations to AM colonization at these northern sites. Fine endophytic fungi, formerly named Glomus tenue (Grenall) I.R. Hall, were recorded at all four sites, but most frequently at Banks Island. We thereby provide further evidence that fine endophytes are more frequent in harsh climatic conditions than AM fungi. There was a relatively high proportion of nonmycorrhizal plant species at all sites, and this proportion increased towards the north.","Olsson, PA; Eriksen, BE; Dahlberg, A",NA,NA,NA,"Olsson, PA; Eriksen, BE; Dahlberg, A",NA,Colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal and fine endophytic fungi in herbaceous vegetation in the Canadian High Arctic,CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0008-4026,NA,NA,NA,NA,NOV,2004,82,11,NA,NA,NA,1547,1556,NA,10.1139/B04-111,http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/B04-111,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000226031700001,NA,7991,Absence,,,,,,,,,,,,,

38,,,Presence,"The core microbiota of plants exerts key effects on plant performance and resilience to stress. The aim of this study was to identify the core endophytic mycobiome in U. minor stems and disentangle associations between its composition and the resistance to Dutch elm disease (DED). We also defined its spatial variation within the tree and among distant tree populations. Stem samples were taken i) from different heights of the crown of a 168-year-old elm tree, ii) from adult elm trees growing in a common garden and representing a gradient of resistance to DED, and iii) from trees growing in two distant natural populations, one of them with varying degrees of vitality. Endophyte composition was profiled by high throughput sequencing of the first internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1) of the ribosomal DNA. Three families of yeasts (Buckleyzymaceae, Trichomeriaceae and Bulleraceae) were associated to DED-resistant hosts. A small proportion (10%) of endophytic OTUs was almost ubiquitous throughout the crown while tree colonization by most fungal taxa followed stochastic patterns. A clear distinction in endophyte composition was found between geographical locations. By combining all surveys, we found evidence of a U. minor core mycobiome, pervasive within the tree and ubiquitous across locations, genotypes and health status.","Macaya-Sanz, D; Witzell, J; Collada, C; Gil, L; Martin, JA",NA,NA,NA,"Macaya-Sanz, David; Witzell, Johanna; Collada, Carmen; Gil, Luis; Martin, Juan A.",NA,Core endophytic mycobiome in <i>Ulmus minor</i> and its relation to Dutch elm disease resistance,FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Macaya-Sanz, David/H-1041-2012; Martín, Juan/B-9729-2012; Gil, Luis/E-3216-2014; Collada, Carmen/H-1529-2015; Witzell, Johanna/H-9987-2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-462X,NA,NA,NA,NA,28-Feb,2023,14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3389/fpls.2023.1125942,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1125942,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36925756,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000949046100001,NA,7403,Absence,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results reveal that CFC from domesticated cattle (Bos taurus) at SNWR, and bison (Bison bison) and black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) at WCNP were diverse but dominated primarily by members within eight taxonomic orders, including the rarely cultured and anaerobic order Neocallimastigales. In addition, 7.7% (138 of 1,788) of the sequences obtained from all dung samples were at least 97% similar to root-associated fungal (RAF) sequences previously described from blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), a common forage grass found throughout North America and growing at both study sites. In contrast, 95.8% (295 of 308) of the sequences and four of the total seven operational taxonomic units obtained from pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) dung belonged to the Pleosporalean order. We hypothesize that some herbivore vectors disperse non-systemic (non-clavicipitaceous) fungal endophytes. These dispersal events, it is argued, are most likely to occur via herbivores that occasionally forage and masticate root tissue, especially in arid regions where aboveground vegetation is sparse. The results of this study suggest that some (possibly many) members of the RAF community can expand their ecological role to include colonizing dung. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Herrera J.; Poudel R.; Khidir H.H.,NA,,NA,"Herrera, José (7201650153); Poudel, Ravin (38461528100); Khidir, Hana H.

43,,,Presence,"Fusarium diseases pose a severe global threat to major cereal crops, particularly wheat. Existing biocontrol strains against Fusarium diseases are believed to primarily rely on antagonistic mechanisms, but not widely used under field conditions. Here, we report an endophytic fungus, Purpureocillium lilacinum YZ1, that shows promise in combating wheat Fusarium diseases. Under glasshouse conditions, YZ1 inoculation increased the survival rate of Fusarium graminearum (Fg)-infected wheat seedlings from 0% to > 60% at the seedling stage, and reduced spikelet infections by 70.8% during anthesis. In field trials, the application of YZ1 resulted in an impressive 89.0% reduction in Fg-susceptible spikelets. While a slight antagonistic effect of YZ1 against Fg was observed on plates, the induction of wheat systemic resistance by YZ1, which is distantly effective, non-specific, and long-lasting, appeared to be a key contributor to YZ1's biocontrol capabilities. Utilizing three imaging methods, we confirmed YZ1 as a potent endophyte capable of rapid colonization of wheat roots, and systematically spreading to the stem and leaves. Integrating dual RNA-Seq, photosynthesis measurements and cell wall visualization supported the link between YZ1's growth-promoting abilities and the activation of wheat systemic resistance. In conclusion, endophytes such as YZ1, which exhibits non-antagonistic mechanisms, hold significant potential for industrial-scale biocontrol applications. © 2024 The Author(s).

44,,,Review,"Aquatic hyphomycetes play a key role in leaf litter decomposition and are mediators of organic matter turnover in streams. Molecular studies have shown that some aquatic fungi are also plant endophytes, however, more evidence is needed to evaluate their multiple ecological abilities. To date, little information is available on fungal lineages that might have undergone convergent evolution to adapt to multiple ecological modes. We examined the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary divergences of aquatic hyphomycetes, endophytic aquatic hyphomycetes and other fungal endophytes of riparian/terrestrial plants by analyzing ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequences retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Sequences with close phylogenetic affinity to aquatic fungi can occur as endophytes of terrestrial plants or in soil far from streams. To fully understand the ecological impact of aquatic hyphomycetes, we need to document and interpret their niches more broadly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

1,,,Review,"Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) can be established as endophytes in the host plants to offer a long-term preventive measure for pests and diseases. This practice serves as a better alternative to the common practice of periodic direct application of EPF on plants or the target pests as a short-term defense strategy against pests and diseases. These fungal endophytes, aside from their role in pests and diseases prevention, also act as plant growth promoters. Several fungal endophytes have been associated with improvement in plant height, dry and wet weight and other growth parameters. However, many limiting factors have been identified as mitigating the successful colonization of the host plants by EPF. The inoculation methods used have been identified as one, but sadly, this has received little or less attention. Some previous studies carried out comparison between various artificial inoculation methods; foliar application, seedling dipping, soil drenching, seed inoculation, direct injection and others. In separate studies, some authors had suggested different application methods that are best suitable for certain fungal entomopathogens. For instance, leaf inoculation with conidial suspensions was suggested to be the best inoculation method for Beauveria bassiana in sorghum, stem injection was suggested as the most suitable for coffee, while, root dipping method proved the most successful for B. bassiana colonization of tomato plants for the management of Helicoverim armigera. Here, we discussed entomopathogenic fungal endophytes as bio-control agents, plant growth promoters and highlighted the effect of various artificial inoculation methods on their endophytic colonization of the host plants.","Bamisile, BS; Dash, CK; Akutse, KS; Keppanan, R; Afolabi, OG; Hussain, M; Qasim, M; Wang, LD",NA,NA,NA,"Bamisile, Bamisope Steve; Dash, Chandra Kanta; Akutse, Komivi Senyo; Keppanan, Ravindran; Afolabi, Oluwatoyin Grace; Hussain, Mubasher; Qasim, Muhammad; Wang, Liande",NA,Prospects of endophytic fungal entomopathogens as biocontrol and plant growth promoting agents: An insight on how artificial inoculation methods affect endophytic colonization of host plants,MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Dash, Chandra/F-9387-2018; BAMISILE, BAMISOPE/AAZ-1862-2021; Akutse, Komivi/I-8137-2019; Hussain, Mubasher/ITV-6682-2023; Qasim, Muhammad/T-9636-2019; Keppanan, ravindran/AFU-6241-2022; BAMISILE, BAMISOPE/IXW-8098-2023; Dash, Chandra Kanta/AEE-7164-2022","Qasim, Muhammad/0000-0002-8063-9140; Akutse, Komivi/0000-0002-2124-1626; BAMISILE, BAMISOPE/0000-0001-5163-3631; Dash, Chandra Kanta/0000-0003-0996-0537; Afolabi, Oluwatoyin Grace/0009-0000-0684-6275",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0944-5013,1618-0623,NA,NA,NA,NA,2018,217,NA,NA,NA,NA,34,50,NA,10.1016/j.micres.2018.08.016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2018.08.016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30384907,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000451654900004,NA,3114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2,,,Both,"A PCR assay which allows detection and quantification of Epichloe endophytes in tissues of the grass Bromus erectus is described. PCR with specific primers flanking a microsatellite-containing locus (MS primers) amplified fragments 300 to 400 bp in length from as little as 1.0 pg of fungal genomic DNA in 100 ng of DNA from infected plant material, When annealing temperatures were optimized, all Epichloe and Acremonium strains tested, representing many of the known taxonomic groups, yielded an amplification product, indicating that the MS primers may be useful for in planta detection of a variety of related species, including agronomically important Acremonium coenophialum and Acremonium lolii. No fragments were generated from DNA isolates from uninfected plant material or from unrelated fungi isolated from B. erectus. For diagnostic applications, a B. erectus-specific primer pair was designed for use in multiplex PCR to allow simultaneous amplification of plant and fungal DNA sequences, providing an internal control for PCR failure caused by inhibitory plant compounds present in DNA extracts, For quantitative applications, a heterologous control template with primer binding sites complementary to the MS primers was constructed for use in competitive PCR, allowing direct quantification of Epichloe endophytes in plant DNA extracts, The fungal DNA present in infected leaves of B. erectus varied between 1 and 20 pg per 100 ng of leaf DNA, but the amounts of fungal DNA present in the sheath and blade of a given leaf were correlated, indicating that the degree of infection varied between plant individuals but that individual leaves were colonized in a uniform way.","Groppe, K; Boller, T",NA,NA,NA,"Groppe, K; Boller, T",NA,PCR assay based on a microsatellite-containing locus for detection and quantification of Epichloe endophytes in grass tissue,APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Boller, Thomas/G-3500-2012","Boller, Thomas/0000-0001-6768-7503",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0099-2240,NA,NA,NA,NA,APR,1997,63,4,NA,NA,NA,1543,1550,NA,10.1128/AEM.63.4.1543-1550.1997,http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/AEM.63.4.1543-1550.1997,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,9097449,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:A1997WR16200051,NA,89,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

4,,,Presence,"IntroductionTechnological advances have made possible long space travels and even exoplanetary colonies in the future. Nevertheless, the success of these activities depends on our ability to produce edible plants in stressful conditions such as high radiation, extreme temperatures and low oxygen levels. Since beneficial microorganisms, such as fungal endophytes from extreme environments, have helped agriculture cope with those difficulties, endophytic fungi may be a putative tool to ensure plant growth under exoplanetary conditions. Additionally, growing crops in polyculture has been shown to increase productivity and spatial efficiency, which is essential given the likely space restrictions in such conditions. MethodsWe evaluated the effect of the inoculation with a mix of two fungal endophytes from the Atacama Desert on performance (survival and biomass) and nutritional quality of three crop species (lettuce, chard and spinach) grown under exoplanetary conditions. In addition, we measured the amount of antioxidants (flavonoids and phenolics) as possible mechanisms to cope with such abiotic conditions. The exoplanetary conditions were; high UV radiation, low temperature, low water availability, and low oxygen levels. These crops were put in growing chambers in monoculture, dual culture and polyculture (the three species in the same pot) for 30 days. Results and DiscussionOur results show that inoculation with extreme endophytes improved survival by ca. 15 - 35% and biomass by ca. 30 - 35% in all crop species. The most evident increase was when grown in polyculture, except for survival in spinach, where inoculated plants had higher survival only in dual culture. Nutritional quality and the amount of the antioxidant compounds antioxidants increased in all crop species when inoculated with the endophytes. Overall, fungal endophytes isolated from extreme environments such as the Atacama Desert, the driest desert in the world, could be a key biotechnological tool for future space agriculture, helping plants cope with environmental stress. Additionally, inoculated plants should be grown in polyculture to increase crop turnover and space-use efficiency. Lastly, these results provide useful insights to face the future challenges of space-farming.","Molina-Montenegro, MA; Escobedo, VM; Atala, C",NA,NA,NA,"Molina-Montenegro, Marco A.; Escobedo, Victor M.; Atala, Cristian",NA,Inoculation with extreme endophytes improves performance and nutritional quality in crop species grown under exoplanetary conditions,FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Escobedo, Víctor/AAV-9690-2021","Escobedo, Victor/0000-0003-2673-3803",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-462X,NA,NA,NA,NA,22-Jun,2023,14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3389/fpls.2023.1139704,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1139704,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37426965,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001020038800001,NA,4648,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,,,Presence,"Within their tissues, plants host diverse communities of fungi, termed fungal endophytes. These fungi can affect plant growth, competitiveness, and resistance to stressors, thereby influencing plant community structure. Research characterizing fungal endophyte communities has so far mostly focused on seed plants, but information on the endophytes of other plant lineages is needed to understand how plant microbiomes impact whole ecosystems and how major changes through land plant evolution have affected plant-microbe relationships. In this study, we assess the fungal endophyte community of the model liverwort Marchantia polymorpha L. by both culturing and Illumina amplicon sequencing methods. We detect a very diverse fungal community that is distinct between M. polymorpha patches and only shares a few core fungi between populations across the United States. We also show low overlap in taxa detected by the different methods. This study helps build a foundation for using M. polymorpha and other Marchantia species as models for the ecology and dynamics of bryophyte microbiomes.","Nelson, J; Shaw, AJ",NA,NA,NA,"Nelson, Jessica; Shaw, A.

6,,,Presence,"The presence of endophytic fungi within symptomless leaves of vascular plants is usually recognised indirectly through culturing methods. In order to understand the biology of fungi isolated as endophytes, there is a need to directly observe their hyphae within the leaves of their hosts. Such observations provide information about the mode of infection, the extent of colonisation within the leaf, and the reaction of the plant to infection by the fungus. Many endophytic fungi develop highly localised infections with small amounts of mycelium, making such direct observations difficult. We describe a method adapted from an electron microscopy protocol that labels one of the constituent components of fungal cell walls with a fluorescent dye and enables them to be observed in thin sections under a compound microscope. © 2006 The British Mycological Society.",Johnston P.R.; Sutherland P.W.; Joshee S.,NA,,NA,"Johnston, P.R.

7,,,Review,"Endophytic fungi are an important component, are ubiquitous and occur within all know plants, including a broad range of hosts in various ecosystems, and therefore play an important role in the natural environment. More than 1 million species of endophytic fungi are estimated to exist based on a ratio of vascular plants to fungal species of 1:4 or 1:5. Nevertheless, our recognition of endophyte diversity is limited at present. In surveys of endophyte diversity, traditional techniques, such as cultivation-dependent methods, have been routinely used in previous studies. The discovery of endophytic fungi in natural environments, however, has been limited by traditional methodology due to some non-sporulating and non-culturable fungi. Molecular techniques, such as DNA fingerprinting and sequencing methods, have been successfully employed in the detection and identification of endophytic fungi, and different endophyte diversity and community composition have been documented by cultivation-dependent and molecular techniques. This review paper summarises recent progress in the study of endophytic fungal diversity and some key questions are highlighted for future research in endophyte biology. © 2012, 2012 Mycological Society of China.",Sun X.; Guo L.-D.,NA,,NA,"Sun, Xiang (55651644800); Guo, Liang-Dong (55782123400)",NA,Endophytic fungal diversity: Review of traditional and molecular techniques,Mycology,NA,NA,English,Article,,,,,NA,Community composition; Cultivation-dependent method; DNA barcode; Endophytic fungi; Pyrosequencing,Fungi; Tracheophyta,"Sun X., State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; Guo L.-D., State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China","State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China","L.-D.

8,,,Review,"The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a genome-editing tool that allows for precise and efficient modifications to the DNA of a cell. This technology can be used in endophytic fungi, which live within plants and can have beneficial effects on their host, making them important for agriculture. Using CRISPR/Cas9, researchers can introduce specific genetic changes into endophytic fungal genomes, allowing them to study the function of genes, improve their plant-growth-promoting properties, and create new, more beneficial endophytes. This system works by using the Cas9 protein, which acts as a pair of molecular scissors, to cut DNA at specific locations determined by a guide RNA. Once the DNA is cut, the cell's natural repair mechanisms can be used to insert or delete specific genes, allowing for precise editing of the fungal genome. This article discusses the mechanism and applications of CRISPR/Cas9 to fungal endophytes.","Verma, V; Batta, A; Singh, HB; Srivastava, A; Garg, SK; Singh, VP; Arora, PK",NA,NA,NA,"Verma, Vinita; Batta, Arpita; Singh, Harikesh B.; Srivastava, Alok; Garg, Sanjay Kumar; Singh, Vijay Pal; Arora, Pankaj Kumar",NA,Bioengineering of fungal endophytes through the CRISPR/Cas9 system,FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ARORA, PANKAJ/F-9418-2014","Arora, Pankaj Kumar/0000-0002-4106-8859",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-302X,NA,NA,NA,16-Mar,2023,14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3389/fmicb.2023.1146650,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2023.1146650,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37007477,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000961194100001,NA,7139,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9,,,Presence,"In the present study, bacterial and fungal endophytes are isolated from Calotropis procera, a drought-resistant plant and studied for their role in plant growth promotion. Among bacterial sp. Enterobacter cloacae subsp. cloacae strain CPR5B and fungus, Penicillium citrinum strain CPL1F, were identified as potent endophytes as both strains were able to produce Indole Acetic Acid (IAA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase and solubilize phosphate. Penicillium citrinum CPL1F also been shown to produce siderophore. The IAA production was observed to be 94.28 mu g/mL and 17.1 mu g/mL for bacterial and fungal sp., respectively. The phosphate solubilization was observed to be 76.41 mu g/mL and 114.57 mu g/mL, respectively. The in vitro plant treatment studies with bacterium and fungus under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions showed that both strains had promoted plant growth in both conditions with respect to their control. Both the strains showed significant changes in most of the growth parameters under endophyte-treated irrigated and non-irrigated conditions, suggesting their stress-dependent plant growth promotion. The present findings will contribute to exploring endophytes that enhance plant growth in adverse conditions and act as plant growth-promoting endophytes.","Jaiswal, S; Ojha, A; Mishra, SK",NA,NA,NA,"Jaiswal, Sonali; Ojha, Anupama; Mishra, Sarad Kumar",NA,Assessment of Plant Growth-Promoting Parameters of Endophytes Isolated from <i>Calotropis procera</i> and Their Performance Under Irrigated and Non-irrigated Conditions,CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Jaiswal, Sonali/0000-0002-1405-2077",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0343-8651,1432-0991,NA,NA,NA,JAN,2024,81,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1007/s00284-023-03570-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00284-023-03570-z,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38147132,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001131533100001,NA,4384,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10,,,Presence,"Fungal endophytes are an important part of the plant microbiome and participate in maintaining the stability of ecosystems. Culture-based methods are frequently considered in studying fungal communities because of their advantages in providing cultures for further experiments and their low cost. In comparison with next-generation sequencing methods, their ability to assess fungal diversity is questionable. Here, we show how using two different incubation temperatures can improve the yield of fungal endophytes by culture-based methods. Diversity, organ preference and spatiotemporal variability of endophytic fungal communities living within Quercus brantii L. were investigated using two different incubation temperatures. To test the effects of using low-temperature incubation on diversity estimations, twigs and leaves of Quercus brantii were incubated under 25 degrees C and 4 degrees C conditions. Isolation rate and Hill's series of diversity were calculated for each sample. Model-based analysis was used to evaluate the effects of (a) incubation temperature, (b) organ type and (c) spatiotemporal variations on fungal isolation rate, fungal diversity and community composition. Our results showed a strong organ specificity and temporal dynamics among endophytic fungal communities, but the location of the forest stand had only a limited effect on fungal community composition. Low-temperature incubation enabled us to improve culture-based methods by discovering the diversity of cold-adapted fungal endophytes and a significantly different part of the endophytic communities that is usually missed by customary culturing temperature. The isolation of cold-adapted endophytes from a semiarid environment opens a new window to further studies on this kind of fungi in such ecosystems.","Doust, NH; Safaie, N; Schmitt, I; Otte, J; Bálint, M",NA,NA,NA,"Doust, Niloufar Hagh; Safaie, Naser; Schmitt, Imke; Otte, Juergen; Balint, Miklos",NA,Culture-based methods using low-temperature incubation revealed cold-adapted fungal endophytes from semiarid forests,FOREST PATHOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hagh Doust, Niloufar/IZP-7786-2023; Safaie, Naser/E-1269-2018","Safaie, Naser/0000-0001-6065-7010; Hagh Doust, Niloufar/0000-0003-0616-5829",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1437-4781,1439-0329,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2019,49,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1111/efp.12515,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/efp.12515,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000472576100005,NA,3578,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11,,,Review,"Plants harbour a heterogeneous population of endogenous microorganisms, comprising both pathogens and non-pathogens, including fungi, bacteria, actinomycetes, etc. Their association has substantial impact on plant health and fitness. Endophytes reside inside healthy plant tissues without producing any disease symptoms. They are helpful in modifying biochemicals produced by plants and may add to their protection from insect herbivores, fungal pathogens and even grazing by animals. However, the ecological role of these endophytes is not yet fully understood. This chapter reports on endophytic fungi present in beet and tomato leaves. Isolation and analysis of endophytic microorganisms of soybean and wheat are also described. It is advocated that endophytes may have a definite role in the biological control of Drechslera tritici-repentis, responsible for tan spot disease in wheat.","Larrán, S; Mónaco, C",NA,"Arya, A; Perello, AE",NA,"Larran, Silvina; Monaco, Cecilia",NA,Status and Progress of Research in Endophytes from Agricultural Crops in Argentina,MANAGEMENT OF FUNGAL PLANT PATHOGENS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Larran, Silvina/JMQ-7653-2023; Mónaco, Cecilia/ABC-2528-2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,978-1-84593-603-7,NA,NA,NA,2010,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,149,161,NA,10.1079/9781845936037.0149,http://dx.doi.org/10.1079/9781845936037.0149,10.1079/9781845936037.0000,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000293273900013,NA,6145,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
12,,,Presence,"There is increasing evidence that microbes play a key role in some plant invasions. A diverse and widespread but little understood group of plant-associated microbes are the fungal root endophytes of the order Sebacinales. They are associated with exotic populations of invasive knotweed (Reynoutria ssp.) in Europe, but their effects on the invaders are unknown. We used the recently isolated Sebacinales root endophyte Serendipita herbamans to experimentally inoculate invasive knotweed and study root colonisation and effects on knotweed growth under different environmental conditions. We verified the inoculation success and fungal colonisation through immunofluorescence microscopy and qPCR. We found that S. herbamans strongly colonized invasive knotweed in low-nutrient and shade environments, but much less under drought or benign conditions. At low nutrients, the endophyte had a positive effect on plant growth, whereas the opposite was true under shaded conditions. Our study demonstrates that the root endophyte S. herbamans has the potential to colonize invasive knotweed fine roots and impact its growth, and it could thus also play a role in natural populations. Our results also show that effects of fungal endophytes on plants can be strongly environment-dependent, and may only be visible under stressful environmental conditions.","Garnica, S; Liao, ZY; Hamard, S; Waller, F; Parepa, M; Bossdorf, O",NA,NA,NA,"Garnica, Sigisfredo; Liao, Zhiyong; Hamard, Samuel; Waller, Frank; Parepa, Madalin; Bossdorf, Oliver",NA,Environmental stress determines the colonization and impact of an endophytic fungus on invasive knotweed,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Parepa, Madalin/G-4352-2011; Garnica, Sigisfredo/P-6506-2014; Bossdorf, Oliver/A-8328-2008","Bossdorf, Oliver/0000-0001-7504-6511; Parepa, Madalin/0000-0002-3567-3884",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1387-3547,1573-1464,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2022,24,6,NA,NA,NA,1785,1795,NA,10.1007/s10530-022-02749-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-022-02749-y,NA,22-Feb,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000757750300002,NA,8418,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13,,,Presence,"High-throughput sequencing technologies using amplicon approaches have changed the way that studies investigating fungal distribution are undertaken. These powerful and time-efficient technologies have the potential for the first time to accurately map fungal distributions across landscapes or changes in diversity across ecological or biological gradients of interest. There is no requirement for a fungus to form a fruiting body to be detected, and both culturable and nonculturable organisms can be detected. Here we use high-throughput amplicon sequencing from bulk DNA extracts to test the impact that biases associated with culture-based methods had on an earlier study that compared the influence of site and host on fungal diversity in Nothofagaceae forests in New Zealand. Both detection methods sampled tissue from the same set of symptomless, living leaves. We found that both the culturing and high-throughput approaches show that host is a stronger driver of fungal community structure than site, but that both methods have some taxonomic biases. We also found that the individual trees selected for high-throughput sampling can impact the alpha-diversity detected and through this could potentially affect subsequent analyses based on a comparison of this diversity. © 2017 The Mycological Society of America.",Johnston P.R.; Park D.; Smissen R.D.,NA,,NA,"Johnston, Peter R.

14,,,Presence,"Simple Summary The richness (number of species) of the fungi kingdom is estimated at 1.5 million species, but the vast majority remains unknown. Many of them inhabit plants-the so-called fungal endophytes-and may establish different types of interactions with their host plant. Fungal endophytes have been traditionally studied by letting them grow in appropriate culturing media in petri dishes, but novel massive DNA sequencing techniques which do not require a cultivation step (metabarcoding) are gaining ground. Both techniques were applied and compared to characterize the mycobiome of plants of a tall grass (Brachypodium rupestre) growing in high-mountain grasslands with different plant diversity (low and high). The two methods showed similar trends comparing endophyte richness between plant tissue types (root > rhizome > shoot) and between grasslands (low-diversity > high-diversity). However, the metabarcoding identified almost six times more endophyte species than the culturing although the most isolated fungal species via culturing, Omnidemptus graminis, was not recognized via metabarcoding. We conclude that the complementation of both techniques is still the best option to obtain a complete characterization of the fungal endophytic assemblage of the plant species. Fungal endophytes develop inside plants without visible external signs, and they may confer adaptive advantages to their hosts. Culturing methods have been traditionally used to recognize the fungal endophytic assemblage, but novel metabarcoding techniques are being increasingly applied. This study aims to characterize the fungal endophytic assemblage in shoots, rhizomes and roots of the tall grass Brachypodium rupestre growing in a large area of natural grasslands with a continuum of anthropized disturbance regimes. Seven out of 88 taxa identified via metabarcoding accounted for 81.2% of the reads (Helotiaceae, Lachnum sp. A, Albotricha sp. A, Helotiales A, Agaricales A, Mycena sp. and Mollisiaceae C), revealing a small group of abundant endophytes and a large group of rare species. Although both methods detected the same trends in richness and fungal diversity among the tissues (root > rhizome > shoot) and grasslands (low-diversity > high-diversity grasslands), the metabarcoding tool identified 5.8 times more taxa than the traditional culturing method (15 taxa) but, surprisingly, failed to sequence the most isolated endophyte on plates, Omnidemptus graminis. Since both methods are still subject to important constraints, both are required to obtain a complete characterization of the fungal endophytic assemblage of the plant species.","Durán, M; San Emeterio, L; Canals, RM",NA,NA,NA,"Duran, Maria; San Emeterio, Leticia; Canals, Rosa Maria",NA,Comparison of Culturing and Metabarcoding Methods to Describe the Fungal Endophytic Assemblage of <i>Brachypodium rupestre</i> Growing in a Range of Anthropized Disturbance Regimes,BIOLOGY-BASEL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Canals, Rosa Maria/L-2312-2014; San Emeterio, Leticia/H-4305-2014","Canals, Rosa Maria/0000-0002-5423-0106; San Emeterio, Leticia/0000-0002-8063-0402; Duran Lazaro, Maria/0000-0001-5842-631X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2079-7737,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2021,10,12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3390/biology10121246,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology10121246,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34943161,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000735982600001,NA,6693,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5351,,,Review,"Microorganisms known as endophytic bacteria populate the intracellular niches within plant tissues without causing any negative or harmful effects. At this time, the world's population is dealing with a slew of deadly chronic diseases that impact humans. Pathogen resistance to commercial antibiotics is rising, decreasing medicines’ therapeutic potential and effectiveness. As a result, finding innovative, inexpensive, and nontoxic natural bioactive chemicals from endophytic fungi in the development of new medications with multifunctional mechanisms to fulfill human demands is critical. Fungal endophytes create valuable bioactive metabolic chemicals that have antibacterial, anticancer, antidiabetic, antiinflammatory, antitumor, and other qualities that are advantageous to humans. Pestacin, taxol, camptothecin, ergoflavin, podophyllotoxin, benzopyran, isopestacin, phloroglucinol, tetrahydroxy-1-methylxanthone, salidroside, borneol, dibenzofurane, methyl peniphenone, lipopeptide, peniphenone, and other bioactive compounds are among them. Despite the relevance of endophytic fungal metabolites, there is little information on their investigation and therapeutic significance. As a result, we will elucidate the fungal bioactive metabolites from medicinal plants, as well as their pharmacological potential, in this a topic. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

40,,,Both,"1. Endophytic fungi are associates of most species of plants and may modify insect community structures through the production of toxic alkaloids. Fertilization is known to increase food plant quality for herbivores, but it is also conceivable that additional nitrogen could increase the production of the insect toxic alkaloid, peramine, in endophyte-infected plants. 2. The relative importance of soil fertility and endophyte infection on herbivores and their natural enemies is unknown. As performance of the host plant is often affected by an interaction between endophyte infection and genetic background, four different plant cultivars were tested. The main questions addressed in this study were whether plant cultivar and fertilizer addition to endophyte-infected and endophyte-free Lolium perenne affect alkaloid concentrations, plant life-history traits and the abundances of aphid species and their parasitoids. 3. In a full factorial outdoor experiment we found a strong positive effect of fertilizer on plant biomass and on the abundance of aphids and parasitoids. While plant traits differed between cultivars, there was little effect of cultivar on either aphid or parasitoid abundance. Only endophyte-infected plants contained alkaloids, and the concentration of peramine was enhanced in fertilized plants. However, endophyte infection had no negative effect on aphid or parasitoid abundances. Plant traits were only weakly influenced by endophyte infection in the field, which contrasts with plant growth room studies, where both germination rate and plant height were influenced by endophyte-cultivar interactions. 4. The generally weak effects of endophytes in the outdoor experiment could be explained by various additional constraints under field conditions and the relatively low peramine concentration that we observed.","Krauss, J; Härri, SA; Bush, L; Husi, R; Bigler, L; Power, SA; Müller, CB","Krauss, J; Härri, SA; Bush, L; Husi, R; Bigler, L; Power, SA; Müller, CB",NA,NA,NA,"Krauss, Jochen; Haerri, Simone A.; Bush, Lowell; Husi, Rene; Bigler, Laurent; Power, Sally A.; Mueller, Christine B.","Effects of fertilizer, fungal endophytes and plant cultivar on the performance of insect herbivores and their natural enemies",NA,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bigler, Laurent/AAP-3799-2020; Harri, Simone/A-6960-2010; Krauss, Jochen/C-6216-2014; Power, Sally/I-2923-2012","Krauss, Jochen/0000-0003-2304-9117; Power, Sally/0000-0002-2723-8671; Bigler, Laurent/0000-0003-3548-3594",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0269-8463,NA,NA,NA,NA,FEB,2007,21,1,NA,NA,NA,107,116,,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2006.01216.x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000243412200012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,40,
8975,,,Presence,"This work, for the first time, investigated the diversity of endophytic fungi harbored in the xylem and phloem of the root of Sophora tonkinensis Gapnep from three geographic localities with emphasis on the influence of the tissue type and geographic locality on endophytic fungal communities and their potential as biocontrol agents against phytopathogens of Panax notoginseng. A total of 655 fungal strains representing 47 taxa were isolated. Forty-two taxa (89.4%) were identified but not five taxa (10.6%) according to morphology and molecular phylogenetics. Out of identifiable taxa, the majority of endophyte taxa were Ascomycota (76.6%), followed by Basidiomycota (8.5%) and Zygomycota (4.3%). The alpha-diversity indices indicated that the species diversity of endophytic fungal community harbored in the root of S. tonkinensis was very high. The colonization and species diversity of endophytic fungal communities were significantly influenced by the geographic locality but not tissue type. The geographic locality and tissue type had great effects on the species composition of endophytic fungal communities. Forty-seven respective strains were challenged by three fungal phytopathogens of P. notoginseng and six strains exhibited significant inhibitory activity. It was noteworthy that endophytic Rhexocercosporidium sp. and F. solani strongly inhibited pathogenic F. solani and other fungal phytopathogens of P. notoginseng. © 2017 The Authors.

5114,,,Presence,"Mangrove forests play an important role in subtropical and tropical coastal ecosystems. Endophytic fungi are widely distributed in various ecosystems and have great contribution to global biodiversity. In order to better understand the effects of mangrove species and tissue types on endophytic fungal community, we investigated cultivable endophytic fungi in leaves and twigs of four mangroves Aegiceras corniculatum, Avicennia marina, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, and Kandelia candel in Guangxi, China. The four tree species had similar overall colonisation rates of endophytic fungi (24–33%). The colonisation rates of endophytic fungi were higher in twigs (30–58%) than in leaves (6–25%) in the four plant species. A total of 36 endophytic fungal taxa were identified based on morphological characteristics and molecular data, including 35 Ascomycota and 1 Basidiomycota, dominated by Phomopsis, Phyllosticta, Xylaria, Leptosphaerulina, and Pestalotiopsis. The diversity of endophytic fungi was higher in twigs than in leaves in the four plant species. Some endophytic fungi showed host and tissue preference. The endophytic fungal community composition was different among four mangrove species and between leaf and twig tissues. © 2016 The Author(s).

Six tine fescue genotypes were successfully inoculated with endophytes originating from fine fescues and Poa ampla Merr. Eleven percent of the tillers were successfully inoculated, and all inoculated plants transmitted the endophytes to their offspring. This set of inoculated plants, with various combinations of genotypes and endophyte strains, allowed us to compare the effects of different endophytes on one host, and one endophyte on several hosts. When evaluated in the field, the growth characteristics of these plants were dependent on endophyte and host genotype. Considerable interaction between the genotypes was seen. For example, one host inoculated with the Poa ampla endophyte showed enhanced performance, while another host inoculated with the same endophyte performed poorly.","Johnson-Cicalese, J; Secks, ME; Lam, CK; Meyer, WA; Murphy, JA; Belanger, FC","Johnson-Cicalese, J; Secks, ME; Lam, CK; Meyer, WA; Murphy, JA; Belanger, FC",NA,NA,NA,"Johnson-Cicalese, J; Secks, ME; Lam, CK; Meyer, WA; Murphy, JA; Belanger, FC",Cross species inoculation of Chewings and strong creeping red fescues with fungal endophytes,NA,CROP SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0011-183X,NA,NA,NA,NA,SEP-OCT,2000,40,5,NA,NA,NA,1485,1489,,10.2135/cropsci2000.4051485x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000089612600040,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,743,
5358,,,Presence,"Microorganisms present in their environment influence plant growth and can be mutualists, such as mycorrhizal-forming fungi; or nonmutualists, such as endophytic fungi. In this study, fungal species from the root and rhizospheric soil of blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) cultivated in the state of Michoacán, México were isolated in order to analyze their potential as promoters of plant development. Six fungal strains were molecularly identified by the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of ribosomal DNA. Its ability to modify the development of Arabidopsis thaliana (Col 0) seedlings was evaluated through two experimental configurations (compartmentalized and non-compartmentalized Petri dishes), to investigate the influence of diffusible and volatile compounds on plant phenotype. Phialocephala fortinii and Mortierella alpina promoted growth of Arabidopsis thaliana especially in compartmentalized dishes, where an increase in the main root length (≥ 2 cm) and in the number of lateral roots (≥ 34) was observed, suggesting that volatile compounds are responsible for these increases. The selected plant-development promoter species were evaluated by ARR5::GUS and DR5::GUS reporter lines to estimate the response of genes to the accumulation of cytokinins and auxins in plant tissues. Results indicate that Phialocephala fortinii and Mortierella alpina act differentially on plant growth and represent a biological resource with great potential for use as biostimulants in current agriculture. © (2023), (Sociedad Mexicana de Fitogenetica).

In this study, we used Pedicularis kansuensis to parasitize Stipa purpurea, both with and without endophytic fungi, and to establish a parasitic system. In this study, endophytic fungal infection was found to increase the dry weight of the leaf, stem, and leaf sheath, as well as the plant height, root length, tiller number, aboveground biomass, and underground biomass of S. purpurea under root hemiparasitic stress. Meanwhile, the C-13 allocation of the leaf sheaths and roots of S. purpurea increased as the density of P. kansuensis increased, while the C-13 allocation of the leaf sheaths and roots of E+ S. purpurea was lower than that of E- S. purpurea. The C-13 allocation of the stem, leaf sheath, and root of E+ S. purpurea was higher than that of its E- counterpart. Furthermore, the content of photosynthetic C-13 and the C-13 partition rate of the stems, leaves, roots, and entire plant of S. purpurea and P. kansuensis transferred from S. purpurea increased as the density of P. kansuensis increased.

2055,,,Presence,"Dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungi represent a frequent root-colonizing fungal group common in environments with strong abiotic stress, such as (semi)arid ecosystems. This work aimed to study the DSE fungi colonizing the plants of semiarid sandy grasslands with wood steppe patches on the Great Hungarian Plain. As we may assume that fungi colonizing both invasive and native species are generalists, root associated fungi (RAF) were isolated from eight native and three invasive plant species. The nrDNA sequences of the isolates were used for identification. To confirm that the fungi were endophytes an artificial inoculation system was used to test the isolates: we considered a fungus as DSE if it colonized the roots without causing a negative effect on the plant and formed microsclerotia in the roots. According to the analyses of the ITS sequence of nrDNA the 296 isolates clustered into 41 groups. We found that 14 of these 41 groups were DSE, representing approximately 60% of the isolates. The main DSE groups were generalist and showed no specificity to area or season and colonized both native and invasive species, demonstrating that exotic plants are capable of using the root endophytic fungi of the invaded areas. The DSE community of the region shows high similarity to those found in arid grasslands of North America. Taking into account a previous hypothesis about the common root colonizers of those grasslands and our results reported here, we hypothesize that plants of (semi) arid grasslands share common dominant members of the DSE fungal community on a global scale.","Knapp, DG; Pintye, A; Kovács, GM","Knapp, DG; Pintye, A; Kovács, GM",NA,NA,NA,"Knapp, Daniel G.; Pintye, Alexandra; Kovacs, Gabor M.",The Dark Side Is Not Fastidious - Dark Septate Endophytic Fungi of Native and Invasive Plants of Semiarid Sandy Areas,NA,PLOS ONE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pintye, Alexandra/KFB-0482-2024; Kovacs, Gabor/AAF-3542-2020; Knapp, Daniel/C-9481-2013","Knapp, Daniel/0000-0002-7568-238X; Pintye, Alexandra/0000-0003-4126-7978; Kovacs, Gabor M./0000-0001-9509-4270",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1932-6203,NA,NA,NA,NA,Feb-29,2012,7,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,10.1371/journal.pone.0032570,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,22393417,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000303003500069,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2055,

One approach to reduce pathological effects has been to introduce an exotic endophyte that does not produce toxic compounds yet still confers host-plant benefits. We measured biomass accumulation and competition between two tall fescue cultivars with different endophytes grown in close proximity and tested if compounds from endophytes can diffuse from one plant to another. Ky31 (tall fescue with natural endophyte) and MaxQ (tall fescue with introduced exotic endophyte) were grown separately and together in a pot experiment under greenhouse conditions. The cultivars had comparable biomass production in monoculture, but when grown in mixed-culture MaxQ had a significantly lower tiller number (2.92 +/- 0.15 tillers/plant) and size (0.048 g +/- 0.003) than Ky31 (4.06 +/- 0.16 tillers/plant) (0.072 +/- 0.002 g). Aqueous endophyte preparations were made and applied topically to E+ and E- Ky31. E- plants receiving doses of this preparation produced significantly more tillers (3 +/- 0.18 tillers/plant) and larger tillers (0.074 +/- 0.006 g) than untreated control plants (2.2 +/- 0.13 tillers/plant) (0.0428 +/- 0.0072 g).

It is a perennial hemiparasitic plant, which is difficult to propagate artificially because of its low parasitic rate. Successful parasitism of parasitic plants is to fuse their tissues and connect their vasculature to the host vasculature building a physiological bridge, which can efficiently withdraw water, sugars and nutrients from their host plants. It is reported that endophytic fungi play an important role in cell wall degradation and fusion, which is the key forming process of the physiological bridge. Therefore, in this study, the endophytic fungi from T. chinensis of different hosts were isolated, and then the organisms that could degrade the main components of the cell walls were screened out using a medium consisting of guaihuol and cellulose degradation capacity. The results showed that five strains were screened out from 72 endophytic fungi of T. chinensis which with high enzyme activities for lignocellulosic degradation. The laccase and cellulase activities of five strains reached their peaks at day 7, and the highest enzyme activities of these two enzymes were found in strain P6, which was 117.66 and 1.66 U/mL, respectively. Manganese peroxidase of strain 4 and lignin peroxidase of strain N6 also reached their peaks at day 7 and were the highest among the 5 strains, with enzyme activities of 11.61 and 6.64 U/mL, respectively.

One hundred and seventy-six fungal isolates were recovered from leaf, stem, and root tissues of C. ipecacuanha. The isolates comprised 28 taxa of Colletotrichum, Ceratobasidium, Fusarium, Trichoderma, Diaporthe, Pochonia, Calonectria, and Xylaria. Colletotrichum was the dominant genus. Colletotrichum gigasporum and Colletotrichum sp. 1 were the most dominant taxa, which occurred systematically in all plant tissues. In contrast, Calonectria lateralis, Fusarium delphinoides, Xylaria sp., and Diaporthe spp. occurred as singlets. We detected a rich and diverse endophytic fungal community in the different tissues of C. ipecacuanha dominated by genera recognised as phytopathogens and decomposers.

Thus, we used high-throughput sequencing methods to compare endophyte diversity from roots of two closely related species, Gentiana officinalis and G. siphonantha, from the same production area, and analyze the association with four secondary metabolites (Gentiopicroside, Loganic acid, Swertiamarine and Sweroside). Results The fungal and bacteria communities' richness and diversity of G. siphonantha was higher than G. officinalis. Ascomycota and Proteobacteria were dominant fungal and bacterial phylum of the two closely related species. At the genus level, Tetracladium and Cadophora were dominant fungal genus in G. officinalis and G. siphonantha samples, respectively. While Pseudomonas was dominant bacterial genus in two closely related species, with relative abundances were 8.29 and 8.05%, respectively. Spearman analysis showed that the content of loganic acid was significantly positively correlated with endophytic fungi, the content of gentiopicroside, swertiamarine and sweroside were significantly positively correlated with endophytic bacteria in the two related species. PICRUSt and FUNGuild predictive analysis indicated that metabolism and saprotroph was primary function of endophytic bacteria and fungi in the two related species. Conclusion Our results will expand the knowledge on relationships of plant-microbe interactions and offer pivotal information to reveal the role of endophytes in the production of Gentiana plant and its important secondary metabolite.","Hou, QZ; Chen, DW; Wang, YP; Ehmet, N; Ma, J; Sun, K","Hou, QZ; Chen, DW; Wang, YP; Ehmet, N; Ma, J; Sun, K",NA,NA,NA,"Hou, Qin Zheng; Chen, Da Wei; Wang, Yu Pei; Ehmet, Nurbiye; Ma, Jing; Sun, Kun",Analysis of endophyte diversity of two <i>Gentiana</i> plants species and the association with secondary metabolite,NA,BMC MICROBIOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"努尔比亚, 艾合买提/HNI-2314-2023; Chen, Dawei/ACX-4433-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1471-2180,NA,NA,NA,NA,7-Apr,2022,22,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,10.1186/s12866-022-02510-4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35392806,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000781354800001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1135,

Hence, in order to meet the requirement, an alternative source for Taxol production, such as filamentous fungi is needed. In this study, a different endophytic fungus was obtained from a particular medicinal plant, Tarenna asiatica, and was selected for Taxol production. Among 28 screened fungi, only six fungal species produced Taxol in the modified liquid medium. The novel Taxol-producing endophytic fungi were identified through morphological and molecular identification using DNA sequencing and phylogenetic tree construction as Aspergillus oryzae. The structure of Taxol obtained from A. oryzae was identified with the appropriate control using an ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer (235 nm), thin layer chromatography (TLC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) analysis. The fungal Taxol (95.04 mu g/L) from the A. oryzae exhibits potent in vitro activity against selected cell line (Human Lung Cancer Cell Line- NCI-H460).","Suresh, G; Kokila, D; Suresh, TC; Kumaran, S; Velmurugan, P; Vedhanayakisri, KA; Sivakumar, S; Ravi, AV","Suresh, G; Kokila, D; Suresh, TC; Kumaran, S; Velmurugan, P; Vedhanayakisri, KA; Sivakumar, S; Ravi, AV",NA,NA,NA,"Suresh, Gopal; Kokila, Dhanasegaran; Suresh, Thirunavukarasu Chitrikha; Kumaran, Subramanian; Velmurugan, Palanivel; Vedhanayakisri, Kaliyappan Amballandi; Sivakumar, Subpiramaniyam; Ravi, Arumugam Veera","Mycosynthesis of anticancer drug taxol by <i>Aspergillus oryzae</i>, an endophyte of <i>Tarenna asiatica</i>, characterization, and its activity against a human lung cancer cell line",NA,BIOCATALYSIS AND AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Suresh, Gopal/T-5580-2018; ran, Kum/AAY-9866-2020; Velmurugan, Palanivel/C-9503-2009; RAVI, ARUMUGAM/ABE-9749-2020; Sivakumar, S./AAD-2198-2020","Thirunavukkarasu, Chitrikha/0009-0009-6464-9363; Dhanasekaran, Kokila/0000-0001-9943-6661; Velmurugan, Palanivel/0000-0001-6506-1953; VEERA RAVI, ARUMUGAM/0000-0002-4768-8389; Subpiramaniyam, Sivakumar/0000-0003-3392-1474; Gopal, Suresh/0000-0003-1547-9344",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1878-8181,NA,NA,NA,MAR,2020,24,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,10.1016/j.bcab.2020.101525,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000529361100003,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,7374,
7393,,,Presence,"Temperate grasses are infected with endophytic fungi of the genus Neotyphodium. These fungi asymptomatically live inside the plant's tissue enhancing resistance of their hosts to herbivores and abiotic stresses. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), infected with Neotyphodium lolii can be detrimental to grazing livestock causing a neural disease. This study aimed at determining the impact of grassland management on fungal incidence. In a rural district of Central Germany 90 sites differing in land use intensity (extensive, intermediate and intensive) and grassland use (pastures, mown pastures, and meadows) were investigated for the presence of N. loliL Infections were detected in 41% of the sites sampled, but overall infection rates were low (5.8 +/- 9.2%). Neither the intensity of land use nor the type of grassland influenced endophytic incidences. In contrast, the geology of the sampled sites had a significant impact on the incidence of N. lolii. Grass tillers collected from limestone sites showed significantly higher infection rates than from other soils. We hypothesize that the low field capacity and high amount of potassium on limestone sites favored the survival of infected grasses under drought stress. Therefore, geology should be taken into account when considering management strategies for this endophytic fungus. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

While culture-dependent methods have been used to characterize some members of the seed mycobiota, recent culture-independent studies have improved the ease in identifying and characterizing full seed fungal communities. In this chapter, we describe how to survey seed fungi using both traditional culture-based methods and culture-free metabarcoding. We first describe protocols for the isolation and long-term preservation of fungal strains from individual seeds and for the extraction and amplification of DNA from such fungal isolates for identification with Sanger sequencing. We also detail how to extract, amplify, and sequence fungal DNA directly from individual seeds. Finally, we provide suggestions for troubleshooting media choices, PCR inhibition by isolates and plant tissue, and PCR limitation by low fungal DNA. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Bergmann G.E.; Heitmann S.J.; Busby P.E.; Leveau J.H.J.,Bergmann G.E.; Heitmann S.J.; Busby P.E.; Leveau J.H.J.,NA,,NA,"Bergmann, Gillian E.

Field sampling of air spora from 18 forest patches was used to calibrate and validate the model, revealing a high likelihood of cross-host colonization events driven by regional wind patterns.

We also detected lineage-specific expansions of carbohydrate-binding modules potentially involved in wall recognition or adhesion. Our study reveals how fungal endophytes may evolve tailored enzymatic repertoires for efficient host colonization, and it highlights promising gene targets for functional assays to assess compatibility with specific plant tissues. These insights expand our understanding of fungal adaptation to endophytic lifestyles and may assist in selecting candidates for synthetic symbiosis applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by endophytic fungi are emerging as important factors in inter-microbial interactions. Here, we profiled the VOC emissions of eight fungal endophytes isolated from diverse angiosperm hosts and assessed their inhibitory effects on common bacterial phytopathogens. Using gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS), we identified over 30 VOCs, including sesquiterpenes, alcohols, and aromatic compounds. Dual-culture assays in sealed plates revealed significant suppression of Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas campestris growth in the presence of specific fungal volatiles, particularly from an isolate of Penicillium sp. We further tested purified compounds and confirmed dose-dependent antibacterial activity for 1-octen-3-ol and ?-caryophyllene. These findings suggest that fungal endophytes contribute to host microbial ecology not only through internal colonization, but also via the emission of bioactive volatiles that alter the surrounding microbiome. Future work should explore VOC biosynthesis pathways and their potential roles in plant-microbe communication.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"As climate change alters temperature regimes, understanding how microbial symbionts respond to thermal variation becomes increasingly important. This study examined the temperature-dependent respiration rates of 12 fungal endophyte isolates obtained from high-elevation alpine plant species. Isolates were cultured under controlled conditions and subjected to temperature ramps from 5C to 35C. Using oxygen consumption measurements, we characterized short-term acclimation responses and fitted thermal performance curves for each isolate. Results showed considerable variability in Q?? values and optimum temperatures, with cold-adapted strains maintaining stable respiration at low temperatures but exhibiting rapid declines above 25C. These patterns suggest that fungal endophytes possess ecotype-specific physiological plasticity that may influence their persistence under future climate scenarios. Our findings underscore the need to consider symbiont physiology when predicting the impacts of climate warming on plant-associated microbial communities in sensitive mountain ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"Culture-based research on fungal endophytes has expanded rapidly, yet inconsistent metadata reporting limits the reusability of strains and comparability across studies. In this study, we analyzed 125 fungal endophyte culture collection records from public and institutional repositories and identified key gaps in strain-level metadata. Less than half of the records included host species information, and fewer still recorded tissue type, surface sterilization method, or isolation medium. To address this issue, we developed a minimum information checklist for fungal endophyte culture metadata (MIC-FECM), modeled after existing microbiome standards. We tested the checklist through a pilot implementation involving four research labs, which reported increased consistency and improved internal tracking. Adoption of standardized metadata practices will enhance the long-term value of fungal endophyte resources and support broader integration with genomic, ecological, and applied datasets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"The distribution of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in fungal endophytes remains largely unexplored across biogeographic gradients. In this study, we characterized the diversity and composition of BGCs in 68 fungal endophyte genomes isolated from canopy leaves of tropical trees sampled in Amazonia, Central America, and West Africa. Using antiSMASH and BiG-SCAPE, we identified over 500 BGCs, including those predicted to encode nonribosomal peptides, polyketides, and terpenes. While taxonomic identity explained some variation in BGC content, geographic origin accounted for a significant portion of beta diversity. Notably, isolates from the Guiana Shield region harbored unique hybrid BGCs not found in other regions. Our findings suggest that biogeographic history and local environmental pressures shape the functional genomic potential of endophytic fungi, with implications for natural product discovery and functional trait evolution. This work underscores the need to integrate geography into comparative genomic analyses of fungal endophytes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"Transcriptomic studies of fungal endophytes are growing in number, yet the annotation of fungal-specific genes remains a major challenge due to limited representation in public databases. We assembled and annotated de novo transcriptomes from six endophyte isolates spanning Cladosporium, Colletotrichum, and Xylaria genera, grown in planta and in culture. Standard annotation pipelines using BLAST and InterProScan resulted in functional assignments for only 4258% of transcripts. Manual curation and hidden Markov model searches using fungal-specific databases (e.g., FungiDB, antiSMASH) improved annotation coverage by 1218%, particularly in genes related to carbohydrate metabolism and secondary metabolism. However, many putative effector proteins and small secreted peptides remained unclassified. This study highlights persistent limitations in the functional characterization of fungal endophyte transcriptomes and argues for the development of endophyte-specific databases and community annotation initiatives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"Endophytic fungi are well-documented in vascular plants, but their roles in nonvascular plants such as bryophytes remain under-theorized. Here we present a conceptual framework for understanding the evolutionary origins and functional dynamics of fungal endophyte associations in mosses and liverworts. Drawing on fossil evidence, developmental constraints, and recent metagenomic findings, we propose that bryophyteendophyte associations may represent one of the earliest forms of land plantfungus symbiosis. Unlike mycorrhizal relationships, endophyte colonization in bryophytes appears to be largely intercellular and restricted to specific tissues, suggesting a fundamentally different mode of interaction. We outline testable predictions regarding the co-evolution of bryophyte life histories and endophyte function, including hypotheses related to desiccation tolerance, nutrient acquisition, and gametophyte dominance. Our model aims to integrate bryophyte-fungus associations into broader theories of plantmicrobe coevolution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"Genetic manipulation of fungal endophytes is limited by a lack of versatile tools adapted to their often slow-growing and recalcitrant biology. We describe the development of a modular plasmid system designed for transformation and functional studies in diverse nonmodel endophytic fungi. The vector includes interchangeable cassettes for promoters, selectable markers, and fluorescent tags, flanked by yeast recombination sites to facilitate one-step assembly. We validated the system in four endophyte species using Agrobacterium-mediated and electroporation-based protocols, achieving transformation efficiencies of 1245%. Reporter assays confirmed stable expression of GFP and mCherry under both constitutive and inducible promoters. This system enables streamlined genetic interrogation of endophytic fungi and supports synthetic biology applications in plant-associated fungal symbionts. Future efforts will focus on expanding promoter options and enabling CRISPR-based gene editing in this platform.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"Interactions between fungal endophytes and co-occurring microbes in the rhizosphere remain understudied, particularly with regard to secondary metabolism. In this work, we co-cultured five foliar fungal endophytes with rhizosphere bacteria commonly isolated from their host plants, including strains of Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and Streptomyces. LC-MS metabolomic profiling revealed substantial shifts in fungal metabolite profiles under co-culture conditions, including induction of cryptic polyketide and alkaloid compounds not observed in monoculture. RNA-seq analyses showed upregulation of biosynthetic gene clusters and transporter genes in the presence of specific bacterial strains, suggesting chemically mediated cross-kingdom signaling. These findings demonstrate that microbial interactions can serve as cues for the activation of silent biosynthetic pathways in endophytic fungi and may be harnessed to unlock novel compounds for pharmaceutical or agricultural applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"While fungal endophytes are traditionally studied in the context of their interactions with living plant tissues, their role following host tissue senescence remains underexplored. In this study, we examined how foliar fungal endophytes influence early-stage leaf litter decomposition in a temperate deciduous forest. Leaf litterbags were prepared using senesced leaves from Acer rubrum with and without prior surface sterilization to reduce endophyte loads. Over 90 days of field incubation, litter with intact endophyte communities showed significantly higher rates of nitrogen and phosphorus release, and FTIR spectroscopy revealed altered lignin degradation profiles. ITS2 metabarcoding indicated that several endophytic taxa remained metabolically active into the decomposition phase, including Phomopsis and Cladosporium species. These findings support the hypothesis that fungal endophytes play a transitional role from endosymbionts to saprotrophs, potentially bridging living and detrital plant phases in terrestrial nutrient cycles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"Exposure to ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B) is an increasingly relevant stressor in both natural and managed ecosystems. To investigate how fungal endophytes cope with this abiotic stress, we cultured eight isolates from desert shrub hosts under controlled UV-B exposure (312 nm, 3 W/m for 2 hours daily). ROS accumulation was quantified using DCFH-DA assays, while antioxidant enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically. Results showed a significant induction of catalase and glutathione reductase activity across all isolates, with xeric-adapted strains exhibiting the most robust upregulation. Confocal microscopy revealed increased hyphal melanization post-exposure, suggesting a protective morphological response. Our data provide new insights into how fungal endophytes physiologically buffer oxidative stress, independent of their plant hosts, and underscore their potential utility in biotechnology and stress-resilient agriculture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"Endophytic fungi are known to produce a suite of extracellular enzymes, but the functional diversity of these enzymes remains under-characterized across taxa. We screened 25 fungal endophyte isolates from monocot and dicot hosts for xylanase and laccase activity under standardized in vitro conditions. Xylanase activity was particularly high in Trichoderma and Nigrospora isolates, with peak expression occurring under low-nitrogen media. In contrast, laccase activity was restricted to a narrow group of Pleosporales isolates and was strongly induced by copper supplementation. Enzymatic activity profiles did not consistently cluster by host plant or tissue type, suggesting that these traits are likely governed by fungal genotype rather than ecological niche. This work lays the foundation for screening fungal endophytes as biocatalysts in industrial and environmental applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"Fungal endophytes are increasingly recognized as mediators of chemical signaling in plant-microbe-invertebrate interactions. In this greenhouse experiment, we grew maize plants inoculated with Fusarium verticillioides or Beauveria bassiana under controlled conditions and used Y-tube olfactometers to test the behavioral responses of two nematode species and the root herbivore Diabrotica virgifera. Volatile collections from rhizospheres indicated distinct profiles associated with endophyte-inoculated plants, including elevated levels of 2-methyl-1-propanol and phenylacetaldehyde. Both Steinernema carpocapsae and D. virgifera larvae exhibited strong attraction to volatiles from B. bassiana-inoculated roots, while F. verticillioides volatiles repelled nematodes. These findings suggest that fungal endophytes may indirectly influence plant fitness by modulating belowground multitrophic interactions through chemical cues. Future work should explore whether these interactions persist across different soil types and host genotypes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"Amplicon-based sequencing has become a cornerstone of fungal endophyte community analysis, yet few tools are tailored to the unique challenges of endophyte datasets, such as co-amplified host DNA, high strain-level diversity, and custom reference databases. We present EndophyteProfiler, an open-source R package designed to facilitate quality control, taxonomic assignment, and diversity analysis for ITS-based endophyte studies. The pipeline includes modules for decontaminating host reads, dereplicating exact sequence variants (ESVs), and visualizing richness across host tissues or treatments. We demonstrate the utility of the tool using a dataset of 16S and ITS sequences from roots and stems of field-grown Populus trees, highlighting differences in alpha diversity between plant compartments. EndophyteProfiler simplifies data processing and promotes reproducibility in fungal endophyte research, particularly for ecologists and microbiome scientists without bioinformatics training.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"Chemotropic responses of fungal endophytes to plant-derived signals remain poorly characterized. A custom microfluidic platform was developed to assess hyphal growth orientation in response to gradients of root exudates and specific phenolic compounds. Hyphae of four endophytic isolates were monitored over 48 hours using time-lapse microscopy. Growth angle distributions were quantified and compared between treatments. Significant chemotropic attraction was observed in Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria alternata isolates exposed to coumaric acid and salicylic acid, while other compounds elicited neutral or inhibitory responses. These results demonstrate a controlled method for evaluating signal-mediated hyphal navigation in endophytes and suggest potential roles of phenolics in non-rhizosphere colonization dynamics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"High up in the rocky slopes of the central Andes, far above the treeline, scientists are discovering fungal endophytes that thrive under some of the harshest conditions on Earth. Isolated from cushion plants and tiny alpine shrubs, these fungi endure intense UV radiation, desiccating winds, and daily freeze-thaw cycles. A recent study used metabolite profiling and genome scans to uncover how these endophytes survive: by producing UV-absorbing pigments, antifreeze proteins, and stress-responsive secondary metabolites. Though invisible to the naked eye, these microscopic symbionts may hold keys to understanding how life adapts to extremesand could even point the way toward engineering climate-resilient crop microbiomes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"While the ecological significance of mycorrhizal symbioses has been well established across plant-dominated ecosystems, the roles of fungal endophytes remain fragmented across disciplinary boundaries. In this perspective, we propose a conceptual synthesis that situates fungal endophytes as ecosystem engineers rather than as accessory symbionts. Drawing from recent work in microbial ecology, physiology, and network theory, we suggest that fungal endophytes can modulate plant water balance, regulate host oxidative state, and influence multi-trophic interactions even in the absence of clear colonization signatures. We advocate for the abandonment of binary mutualism-pathogenicity models in favor of functional trait-based frameworks that emphasize context-dependent outcomes. Such reframing may enable better predictions of how endophyte communities mediate ecosystem responses to disturbance, nutrient fluxes, and global change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"Maintaining viable fungal endophyte cultures over the long term is crucial for reproducibility and strain reuse, yet cryopreservation protocols are inconsistently applied. In this study, we tested five cryoprotectant formulations and two freezing methods on 20 endophytic fungal strains, including slow-growing taxa from leaf and root tissues. Viability after six months at ?80C was highest when using 15% glycerol or skim milk with mycelial mats rather than spores. Rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by storage at ?80C outperformed slow-cooling methods for most taxa. Recovery success was strain-specific: Xylaria spp. showed 100% regrowth, while some Phialocephala isolates failed to revive. Based on these results, we provide a protocol optimized for broad recovery of endophytic fungi, intended for use in both research collections and microbial repositories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"Fungal endophytes are often studied in isolation, their roles compartmentalized into agricultural, ecological, or biotechnological silos. Here, we argue for a new systems-level approach that situates fungal endophytes within the circular bioeconomy. By mapping current research onto the EU Bioeconomy Strategy framework, we identify overlooked intersections with waste valorization, regional biomanufacturing, and low-input biostimulant development. Despite their metabolic flexibility, fungal endophytes are rarely represented in industrial biotechnology pipelineslikely due to regulatory uncertainty, inconsistent culturing standards, and limited strain banks with metadata suitable for commercial scaling. We call for cross-sector data integration, standardized strain documentation, and policies that promote open-source bioprospecting while protecting genetic resources. Endophyte research stands at a crossroads: will it remain a niche field, or become a pillar of resilient bio-based innovation?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"Numerous fungal endophyte studies report isolates of Phialocephala fortinii without clarifying their placement within the PAC (Phialocephala fortinii s.l.  Acephala applanata complex). To resolve these ambiguities, we sequenced rDNA ITS and partial ?-tubulin regions from 38 archived isolates labeled P. fortinii in ecological studies spanning Europe, North America, and East Asia. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that over half of these strains are better assigned to P. subalpina, P. bamuru, or unnamed clades within PAC Group B. We provide updated morphological and growth descriptions for representative strains and deposit corrected sequences in GenBank. This clarification will assist future functional trait work that requires precise taxonomic identity, particularly in endophyte-driven mycorrhiza mimicry and root-dominant fungal communities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,Other,"As synthetic ecology expands, the demand for predictive models of fungal endophytehost compatibility is growing. We present an early-stage framework for building a trait-based atlas of fungal endophytes using machine learning on genomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic datasets. Using publicly available genomes from 94 endophytic isolates and metadata on host range, tissue preference, and colonization style, we trained a Random Forest classifier to predict host compatibility based on CAZyme content, secondary metabolite gene clusters, and effector-like protein profiles. Preliminary results indicate that host range is most strongly associated with terpene synthase diversity and secreted oxidoreductases. While the model is not yet production-ready, it highlights the feasibility of algorithmically matching fungal isolates with host traitsan important step toward designing synthetic endophyte consortia for future ecological or agricultural applications.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,,,Review,"84Endophytic organisms are widespread in nature, occurring in both marine and terrestrial environments, where they exist in a range of associations, from parasitic to mutualistic, with their hosts. 26 The “true endophytes” are those that grow entirely within the plant, relying on their host not only for nutrition but also for transmission, either vegetatively or within the seed. The fungal endophytes considered in this review grow in mutualistic associations almost entirely within the tissues of living plants. This definition excludes the mycorrhiza and smuts, which can live both internally and externally, but includes fungi that may produce external mycelia or sexual spores that are disseminated to produce new infections. © 1994 by Taylor & Francis.",Popay A.J.; Rowan D.D.,,Popay A.J.; Rowan D.D.,NA,,NA,Endophytic fungi as mediators of plant-insect interactions,Insect-Plant Interactions,NA,,NA,NA,English,,,,,NA,,,"Pastoral Research Institute of New Zealand, Ltd., Palmerston North, New Zealand; Horticulture and Food Research Institute of New Zealand, Ltd., Palmerston North, New Zealand","Popay A.J., Pastoral Research Institute of New Zealand, Ltd., Palmerston North, New Zealand; Rowan D.D., Horticulture and Food Research Institute of New Zealand, Ltd., Palmerston North, New Zealand",,NA,NA,NA,,NA,,"Ahmad S., Govindarajan S., Funk C.R., Johnson-Cicalese J.M., Fatality of house crickets on perennial ryegrass infected with a fungal endophyte, Entomol.

,,,Other,"A CE method is described for the enantioselective analysis of propranolol (Prop) and 4-hydroxypropranolol (4-OH-Prop) in liquid Czapek medium with application in the study of the enantioselective biotransformation of Prop by endophytic fungi. The electrophoretic conditions previously optimized were as follows: an uncoated fused-silica capillary, 4%w/v carboxymethyl-beta-CD in 25 mmol/L triethylamine/phosphoric acid (H3PO4) buffer at pH 9 as running electrolyte and 17 kV of voltage. UV detection was carried out at 208 nm. Liquid-liquid extraction using diethyl ether: ethyl acetate (1:1 v/v) as extractor solvent was employed for sample preparation. The calibration curves were linear over the concentration range of 0.25-10.0 mu g/mL for each 4-OH-Prop enantiomer and 0.10-10.0 mu g/mL for each Prop enantiomer (r >= 0.995). Within-day and between-day relative standard deviations and relative errors for precision and accuracy were lower than 15% for all the enantiomers. Finally, the validated method was used to evaluate Prop biotransformation in its mammalian metabolite 4-OH-Prop by some selected endophytic fungi. The screening of five strains of endophytic fungi was performed and all of them could biotransform Prop to some extent. Specifically, Glomerella cingulata (VA1) biotransformed 47.8% of (-)-(S)-Prop to (-)-(S)-4-OH-Prop with no formation of (+)-(R)4-OH-Prop in 72 h of incubation.","Borges, KB; Pupo, MT; Bonato, PS",,"Borges, KB; Pupo, MT; Bonato, PS",NA,NA,NA,Enantioselective analysis of propranolol and 4-hydroxypropranolol by CE with application to biotransformation studies employing endophytic fungi,ELECTROPHORESIS,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Borges, Keyller/A-7712-2012; Pupo, Monica/D-8628-2012","Borges, Keyller/0000-0003-1067-1919; Pupo, Monica/0000-0003-2705-0123",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0173-0835,1522-2683,NA,NA,NOV,2009,,30,22,NA,SI,NA,3910,3917,10.1002/elps.200900216,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/elps.200900216,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19876961,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000272474900015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,83
,,,Other,"A Gram-stain-positive strain, designated DT7-02(T), was isolated from the surface-sterilized root of Oenotherabiennis (evening primrose) and subjected to taxonomic characterization. Cells of DT7-02(T) were slender rod-shaped, motile by means of flagella, and oxidase-and catalase-positive. The colonies were circular, pinkish-yellow, opaque, glistering and 1-2mm in diameter. The strain was moderately thermophilic and halophilic, as growth occurred at 20-44 degrees C (optimum 40 degrees C), pH 7-10 (optimum pH 8-9) and in the presence of 0-8% of NaCl (optimum 4 %) in tryptic soy broth. The analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the strain represented a member of the genus Pseudogracilibacillus of the family Bacillaceae, and the sequence similarity was 96.5% with Pseudogracilibacillus auburnensis P-207(T) and 95.9% with Pseudogracilibacillus marinus NIOT-bflm-S4(T). Other related taxa were Ornithinibacillus contaminans DSM 22953(T) and Sinibacillus soli KCTC 33117(T), with 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 95.4 and 94.3 %, respectively. The major cellular fatty acids of DT7-02(T) were anteiso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0 and iso-C-16:0. The DNA G+C content was 35.1 mol%, and the respiratory quinone was MK-7. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. The combination of chemotaxonomic properties enabled differentiation of DT7-02(T) from the other two species of the genus Pseudogracilibacillus. The results of phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic analyses demonstrate that strain DT7-02(T) (=KCTC 33854(T) =JCM 31192(T)) merits recognition as representing a novel species of the genus Pseudogracilibacillus, for which the name Pseudogracilibacillus endophyticus sp. nov. is proposed.","Park, J; Kim, MK; Yun, BR; Han, JH; Kim, SB",,"Park, J; Kim, MK; Yun, BR; Han, JH; Kim, SB",NA,NA,NA,"<i>Pseudogracilibacillus endophyticus</i> sp nov., a moderately thermophilic and halophilic species isolated from plant root",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"bum, Kim/F-6267-2013","Kim, Min-Kyeong/0000-0002-7014-3010",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1466-5026,1466-5034,NA,NA,JAN,2018,,68,1,NA,NA,NA,165,169,10.1099/ijsem.0.002475,http://dx.doi.org/10.1099/ijsem.0.002475,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29125459,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000425219900027,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,86

This fungus produces a unique mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including a series of sesquiterpenoids, some alcohols and several reduced naphthalene derivatives. Trans-caryophyllene, a product in the fungal VOCs, was also noted in the VOCs of this pungent plant. The gases of Phoma sp. possess antifungal properties and is markedly similar to that of a methanolic extract of the host plant. Some of the test organisms with the greatest sensitivity to the Phoma sp. VOCs were Verticillium, Ceratocystis, Cercospora and Sclerotinia while those being the least sensitive were Trichoderma, Colletotrichum and Aspergillus.

,,,Presence,"A bioassay to screen fungal isolates for endophytic growth and antagonism against Fusarium verticillioides in maize was developed. The method was based on the commonly used toothpick inoculation method followed by measurement of stalk necrosis, and was designed to assure a direct introduction of the endophyte into the plant. Thirty-four fungal endophytes isolated from surface sterilized grass and maize stalks from Costa Rice, and four soil isolates were tested for antagonism and endophyte growth. Six isolates gave less necrosis (P < 0.05) than the control treated with F. verticillioides alone but only one isolate, Trichoderma koningii S8, reduced the stalk necrosis when the test was repeated. Reisolations fi om the stalk showed that none of the isolates were able to completely eliminate F. verticillioides from the maize stalk. It is concluded that F. verticillioides is a very strong competitor that is highly adapted to live in association with maize, and that an effective antagonist against F. verticillioides still remains to be found. The screening assay developed in this study may prove to be a useful tool to study the in vivo interactions between plant pathogens and antagonistic endophytes.","Danielsen, S; Jensen, DF",,"Danielsen, S; Jensen, DF",NA,NA,NA,"Fungal endophytes from stalks of tropical maize and grasses:: Isolation, identification, and screening for antagonism against <i>Fusarium verticillioides</i> in maize stalks",BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Jensen, Dan/G-9041-2012","Danielsen, Solveig/0000-0002-0464-8395",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0958-3157,1360-0478,NA,NA,DEC,1999,,9,4,NA,NA,NA,545,553,10.1080/09583159929505,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09583159929505,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000085254100009,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,93
,,,Other,"A broad-spectrum endophytic Phomopsis liquidambari, was used to degrade environmental pollutant indole. In the condition of using indole as sole carbon and nitrogen source, the optimum concentration of indole supplied was determined to be 100 mg L-1, with 41.7% ratio of indole degradation within 120 h. Exogenous addition of plant litter significantly increased indole degradation to 99.1% within 60 h. Indole oxidation to oxindole and isatin were the key steps limiting indole degradation. Plant litter addition induced fungus to produce laccase and LiP to non-specific oxidize indole. The results of fungal metabolites pathway through HPLC-MS and NMR analysis showed that indole was firstly oxidized to oxindole and isatin, and deoxidated to indolenie-2-dione, then hydroxylated to 2-dioxindole, which pyridine ring were cleaved through C-N position and changed to 2-aminobenzoic acid.

,,,Both,"A cryptic fungal endophyte, Neotyphodium coenophialum, infects most tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) pastures in the United States. Cattle, sheep, and horses that consume the endophyte-infected grass can suffer fescue toxicosis caused by toxic alkaloids in the infected plants. The effects of the endophyte on mammalian herbivores have been well documented. but less is known regarding the quality of the grass (infected vs noninfected) as a food material for soil invertebrates. We conducted 21-d tests with earthworms (Eisenia fetida) to determine the nutritional quality of endophyte-infected and noninfected tall fescue leaf and root tissues. Earthworm survival, growth, and reproduction were measured in each treatment combination of tissue type and infection status. Earthworm survival was 100% in all treatments. Tall fescue tissue type (leaf vs root) and infection status (present or absent) both significantly affected E. fetida growth and reproduction. The earthworms grew and had moderate levels of reproduction in replicates containing tall fescue leaf tissue as the sole food source regardless of the endophyte-infection status, but earthworms lost weight and had less reproduction in replicates where tall fescue root tissue was the sole food source. An unexpected effect of infection status on earthworm growth in the tall fescue leaf-tissue treatments was also evident: mean growth of E. fetida with access to endophyte-infected leaf tissue as the sole food source was 3.6-fold greater than mean growth of E. fetida with access to noninfected leaf tissue as the sole food source, Knowledge regarding the relative effects of endophyte status of tall fescue on soil organisms may allow the development of more effective environmental management strategies at sites where tall fescue is being considered for use in phytoremediation or for vegetative cover. Investigators working with tall fescue should be alert to the possibility of endophyte-mediated effects of tall fescue on other organisms and, at a minimum, should provide information regarding the grass's infection status when reporting the results of studies that involve use of tall fescue.","Humphries, SS; Gwinn, KD; Stewart, AJ",,"Humphries, SS; Gwinn, KD; Stewart, AJ",NA,NA,NA,Effects of endophyte status of tall fescue tissues on the earthworm (<i>Eisenia fetida</i>),ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"; stewart, arthur/D-8471-2012","Gwinn, Katrina/0000-0002-8277-651X; stewart, arthur/0000-0003-1968-5997",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0730-7268,1552-8618,NA,NA,JUN,2001,,20,6,NA,NA,NA,1346,1350,10.1002/etc.5620200625,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/etc.5620200625,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,11392146,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000170166000025,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,111

Some sequences of unidentified endophytic fungi uploaded to the GenBank database by other researchers were also identified as P. mystica in our phylogeny. By checking the original literature of these sequences, P. mystica was further found to act as an endophyte in a broad range of host plants including Aegiceras, Cinnamomum, Dendrobium and Lindera, probably lurking in the tissues of the host plants as invisible mycelium in most cases and only producing visible ascomata following senescence of the host tissues. Such ecology and a combination of all its morphological characteristics make P. mystica recognizable from other known species of Pseudoplectania.

,,,Presence,"A deficiency of the essential macronutrient sulfur leads to stunted plant growth and yield loss; however, an association with a symbiotic fungus can greatly improve nutrient uptake by the host plant. Here, we identified and functionally characterized a high-affinity sulfate transporter from the endophytic fungus Serendipita indica. SiSulT fulfills all the criteria expected of a functional sulfate transporter responding to sulfur limitation: SiSulT expression was induced when S. indica was grown under low-sulfate conditions, and heterologous expression of SiSulT complemented a yeast mutant lacking sulfate transport. We generated a knockdown strain of SiSulT by RNA interference to investigate the consequences of the partial loss of this transporter for the fungus and the host plant (maize, Zea mays) during colonization. Wild-type (WT) S. indica, but not the knockdown strain (kd-SiSulT), largely compensated for low-sulfate availability and supported plant growth. Colonization by WT S. indica also allowed maize roots to allocate precious resources away from sulfate assimilation under low-sulfur conditions, as evidenced by the reduction in expression of most sulfate assimilation genes. Our study illustrates the utility of the endophyte S. indica in sulfur nutrition research and offers potential avenues for agronomically sound amelioration of plant growth in low-sulfate environments.","Narayan, OP; Verma, N; Jogawat, A; Dua, M; Johri, AK",,"Narayan, OP; Verma, N; Jogawat, A; Dua, M; Johri, AK",NA,NA,NA,Sulfur transfer from the endophytic fungus <i>Serendipita indica</i> improves maize growth and requires the sulfate transporter SiSulT,PLANT CELL,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Narayan, Om Prakash/ABI-2493-2020","Verma, Nidhi/0000-0003-0643-8858; Narayan, Om Prakash/0000-0002-6409-8540; Johri, atul/0000-0001-9480-3063; Jogawat, Abhimanyu/0000-0002-6046-7070",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1040-4651,1532-298X,NA,NA,APR,2021,,33,4,NA,NA,NA,1268,1285,10.1093/plcell/koab006,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/plcell/koab006,NA,21-Jan,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33793849,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000671679400041,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,117

,,,Presence,"A distinctive fungal endophyte, Cashhickia acuminata nov. gen. et sp., is described from permineralized calamite roots from the Upper Pennsylvanian Grand-Croix cherts of France. Heavily infected roots contain numerous intracellular hyphae in the outer cortex that arise from a meshwork-like mycelium extending between cortical cells. All intracellular hyphae are oriented toward the root center; none occur on the inner periclinal host cell walls. Other roots of the same type show localized infection by this fungus in which isolated cortical cells contain or give rise to intracellular fungal growth. Within the cortical cells are host responses in the form of callosities that indicate the roots were alive at the time of infection. Other endophytes are present in the same host tissue but are less frequent. The discovery of this association provides the first detailed account on the morphology of a Carboniferous fungal root endophyte, as well as the spatial distribution within the host, and infection pathways within the cortical tissues.

,,,Review,"A diverse beneficial microbial community inhabits soil, with fungi comprising a major component. Fungi can establish in plants as endophytes and as a result, these plant-fungal interactions are associated with different trade-offs. Endophytic insect-pathogenic fungi (EIPF) establish a unique association with plants that can promote growth of host plants and can have detrimental effects on pest insects. The mechanisms of plant growth promotion are diverse and include nutrient exchange, plant defense modulation, and protection from pests and diseases. There is increasing interest in understanding the potential for exploiting EIPF to enhance plant productivity and tolerance to arthropod pests in agricultural systems, especially under changing climate conditions. EIPF mediate plant defense signaling through crosstalk in phytohormone-based defense systems and fine-tuning signaling pathways in the presence of stress. Secondary metabolites and other compounds in root exudates can affect the fate of EIPF-plant-stress interactions. Through these mechanisms, plants can fine-tune growth and defense in a balanced manner. Developing a better understanding of the ecology and biology of EIPF and their interactions with plants and arthropods will contribute to the achievement of agricultural sustainability. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",Ahmad I.; Jiménez-Gasco M.M.; Barbercheck M.E.,,Ahmad I.; Jiménez-Gasco M.M.; Barbercheck M.E.,NA,,NA,The Role of Endophytic Insect-Pathogenic Fungi in Biotic Stress Management,Plant Stress Biology: Strategies and Trends,NA,,NA,NA,English,,,,,NA,Fungal endophytes; Insect-pathogenic fungi; Plant defense; Plant growth promotion; Stress; Sustainable agriculture,,"Department of Entomology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, United States; Department of Plant Pathology and Environmental Microbiology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, United States","Ahmad I., Department of Entomology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, United States; Jiménez-Gasco M.M., Department of Plant Pathology and Environmental Microbiology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, United States; Barbercheck M.E., Department of Entomology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, United States","I.

,,,Other,"A dsRNA virus with a genome of 3.5 kb was isolated from field and green house-grown tomato plants of different cultivars and geographic locations in North America. Cloning and sequencing of the viral genome showed the presence of two partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), and a genomic organization resembling members of the family Totiviridae that comprises fungal and protozoan viruses, but not plant viruses. The 5'-proximal ORF codes for a 377 amino acid-long protein of unknown function, whereas the product of ORF2 contains typical rnotifs of an RNA-dependant RNA-polymerase and is likely expressed by a + 1 ribosomal frame shift. Despite the similarity in the genome organization with members of the family Totiviridae, this virus shared very limited sequence homology with known totiviruses or with other viruses. Repeated attempts to detect the presence of an endophytic fungus as the possible host of the virus failed, supporting its phytoviral nature. The virus was efficiently transmitted by seed but not mechanically and/or by grafting. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that this virus, for which the name Southern tomato virus (STV) is proposed, belongs to a partitivirus-like lineage and represents a species of a new taxon of plant viruses.

,,,Presence,"A fungal endophyte identified as Fusarium sp. Tlau3 was isolated from fresh twig of Thunbergia laurifolia Lindl., a Thai medicinal plant collected from the forest of Chiang Mai Province, Northern Thailand. The fungus was grown on a medium containing yeast extracts and sucrose. The fungal metabolites were isolated from the culture broth by dichloromethane extraction, isooctane/methanol then n-butanol/water partitions, and fractionation with Sephadex LH 20 column chromatography. Acanthamoebicidal fractions were found to induce the formation of large contractile vacuole (LCV) in trophozoites of an Acanthamoeba clinical isolate, leading to cell lysis under isotonic and hypotonic conditions within 1 h. In hypertonic condition, LCV formation was also induced but without cell lysis.

,,,Presence,"1. Plants have developed a variety of defence strategies against herbivores. One possible strategy is the induced production of metabolites following herbivore attack. Plant-associated micro-organisms can be the source of such defensive compounds. For example, cool-season grasses can be associated with systemic endophytic fungi of the genus Epichloe, which produce herbivore-toxic alkaloids. 2. In a controlled common garden approach, we tested the hypothesis that different types of herbivory induce endophyte growth and increase the endophyte-mediated production of three bioactive alkaloids which can deter or toxify herbivores. During 18 weeks, we analysed biweekly endophyte and alkaloid concentrations in the grass Lolium perenne infected with the endophytic fungus Epichloe festucae var. lolii. The experiment was conducted throughout the field season and compared three different herbivore treatments to the control treatment (herbivory exclosure). 3. We showed that the concentration of the vertebrate toxic alkaloid lolitrem B increased following clipping (a simulation of grazing herbivores), while the insect deterring alkaloid peramine increased following locust herbivory (biting-chewing herbivores). The endophyte concentration increased slightly following clipping (P = 0.09). Sap sucking aphids altered neither endophyte nor alkaloid concentrations. 4. Our study provides evidence for an herbivore-specific induction of endophyte-mediated responses following herbivore attack on its host grass. Our results suggest that the grass-endophyte symbiosis involves a close chemical crosstalk between the interacting partners.","Fuchs, B; Krischke, M; Mueller, MJ; Krauss, J",,"Fuchs, B; Krischke, M; Mueller, MJ; Krauss, J",NA,NA,NA,Herbivore-specific induction of defence metabolites in a grass-endophyte association,FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mueller, martin/C-7616-2019; Fuchs, Benjamin/X-2095-2019; Krauss, Jochen/C-6216-2014","Fuchs, Benjamin/0000-0002-3678-3284; Krauss, Jochen/0000-0003-2304-9117",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0269-8463,1365-2435,NA,NA,FEB,2017,,31,2,NA,NA,NA,318,324,10.1111/1365-2435.12755,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2435.12755,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000394374100005,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,57
,,,Presence,"16 endophytic strains of fungi were isolated from roots, stems and leaves of two different origins of Arundina graminifolia using classical endophyte isolation method during an interesting investigation on the culturable endophyte communities and diversities of Arundina graminifolia grown in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan province and Baise, Guangxi province. Among them, Four endophytic fungi were isolated from Arundina graminifolia grown in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan province, and 12 endophytic fungi were isolated from Arundina graminifolia grown in Baise, Guangxi province. According to the morphological observation and ITS gene sequence homology analysis, they were divided into 7 categories, including Phanerochaete sp., Phyllosticta capitalensis, Diaporthe sp., Hypoxylon sp., Nodullsporium sp., Chaetomium nigricolor, and the other 10 strains belonging to Colletotrichum sp., indicating that Colletotrichum sp. was a dominant species of endophytic fungi. Two kinds of strains BSSF-2 and YNLF-1 (DPPH free radicals scavenging rate ≥80%) with strong antioxidant activity were obtained by measuring the antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging assay, the reducing ability of Fe3+ and H2O2 radical scavenging assay) of 5 endophytic fungi (i.e., YNLF-1, BSSF-2, BSRF-1, BSRF-2 and BSRF-3). The strain BSSF-2 was identified as Colletotrichum karstii, the strain YNLF-1 was Phanerochaete sp. The results of this study showed that the endophytic fungi of medicinal plants had broad prospects for the development of antioxidant drugs. © 2018, Editorial Board of Modern Food Science and Technology.

This investigation contributed to the knowledge about the metabolic production of two endophytic fungi Saccharicola sp. and Botryosphaeria parva in co-culture, once, until the present date, there are no studies in the literature that report the understanding of the chemical interaction of both grown in the same environment.","Costa, MF; Borges, MS; Chapla, VM; Biasetto, CR; Nascimento, IR; Bolzani, VS; Araujo, AR",,"Costa, MF; Borges, MS; Chapla, VM; Biasetto, CR; Nascimento, IR; Bolzani, VS; Araujo, AR",NA,NA,NA,"Evaluation of the Metabolic Production from the Co-Culture of<i> Saccharicola</i> sp. and<i> Botryosphaeria</i><i> parva,</i> an Endophytic Fungi Associated with<i> Eugenia</i><i> jambolana</i> Lam.",JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Borges, Maiara/LGY-3260-2024; Chapla, Vanessa/F-2210-2018; Nascimento, Isabele/F-6902-2014","Nascimento, Isabele/0000-0002-0445-0311",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0103-5053,1678-4790,NA,NA,SEP,2023,,34,9,NA,NA,NA,1347,1352,10.21577/0103-5053.20230046,http://dx.doi.org/10.21577/0103-5053.20230046,NA,23-Mar,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000966705000001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,197
,,,Presence,"A series of isolates of Cladosporium spp. were recovered in the course of a cooperative study on galls formed by midges of the genus Asphondylia (Diptera, Cecidomyidae) on several species of Lamiaceae. The finding of these fungi in both normal and galled flowers was taken as an indication that they do not have a definite relationship with the midges. Moreover, identification based on DNA sequencing showed that these isolates are taxonomically heterogeneous and belong to several species which are classified in two different species complexes. Two new species, Cladosporium polonicum and Cladosporium neapolitanum, were characterized within the Cladosporium cladosporioides species complex based on strains from Poland and Italy, respectively. Evidence concerning the possible existence of additional taxa within the collective species C. cladosporioides and C. pseudocladosporioides is discussed.","Zimowska, B; Becchimanzi, A; Krol, ED; Furmanczyk, A; Bensch, K; Nicoletti, R",,"Zimowska, B; Becchimanzi, A; Krol, ED; Furmanczyk, A; Bensch, K; Nicoletti, R",NA,NA,NA,New <i>Cladosporium</i> Species from Normal and Galled Flowers of Lamiaceae,PATHOGENS,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Becchimanzi, Andrea/AAQ-2734-2020; Król, Ewa/G-9148-2018; Nicoletti, Rosario/H-6500-2019; Zimowska, Beata/ABF-2696-2020","Becchimanzi, Andrea/0000-0001-5117-0235; Zimowska, Beata/0000-0001-5524-7623; Nicoletti, Rosario/0000-0002-3049-4641",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2076-0817,NA,NA,MAR,2021,,10,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3390/pathogens10030369,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/pathogens10030369,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33808618,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000633982800001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,322
,,,Presence,"A study has been undertaken with an aim to isolate potent endophytic fungi from mangrove plant Lumnitzera racemosa Linn. Among the 10 different fungal strains isolated, one potent strain with broad-spectrum antagonistic activity was found. Basing on the morphological, cultural and molecular characteristics, the potent fungal strain was identified as Cladosporium cladosporioides. Production of bioactive metabolites by the strain was high in Malt Extract Broth compared to other media tested. The culture utilized Mannitol and Beef extract as good carbon and Nitrogen sources for the elaboration of bioactive metabolites. The optimum pH and Temperature for bioactive metabolite production of the strain were recorded at 4.0 and 30 degrees C. The secondary metabolites produced by the strain grown under optimal conditions exhibited high antagonistic activity against gram-positive as well as Gram-negative bacteria and fungi.

,,,Presence,"Alternaria alternata that threatens pepper production and causes major economic harm is responsible for the leaf spot/blight disease. Chemical fungicides have been widely employed; unfortunately, fungicidal resistance is a current concern. Therefore, finding new environmentally friendly biocontrol agents is a future challenge. One of these friendly solutions is the use of bacterial endophytes that have been identified as a source of bioactive compounds. The current study investigates the in vivo and in vitro fungicidal potential of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens RaSh1 (MZ945930) against pathogenic A. alternata. In vitro, the results revealed that RaSh1 exhibited strong antagonistic activity against A. alternata. In addition to this, we inoculated pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) plants with B. amyloliquefaciens RaSh1 and infected them with A. alternata. As a result of A. alternata infection, which generated the highest leaf spot disease incidence (DI), the plant's growth indices and physio-biochemical characteristics significantly decreased, according to our findings. Our results also showed the abnormal and deformed cell structure using light and electron microscopy of A. alternata-infected leaves compared with other treatments. However, DI was greatly reduced with B. amyloliquefaciens RaSh1 application (40%) compared to pepper plants infected with A. alternata (80%), and this led to the largest increases in all identified physio-biochemical parameters, including the activity of the defense-related enzymes. Moreover, inoculation of pepper plants with B. amyloliquefaciens RaSh1 decreased electrolyte leakage by 19.53% and MDA content by 38.60% as compared to A. alternata infected ones. Our results show that the endophyte B. amyloliquefaciens RaSh1 has excellent potential as a biocontrol agent and positively affects pepper plant growth. © 2023, The Author(s).",Soliman S.A.; Abdelhameed R.E.; Metwally R.A.,,Soliman S.A.; Abdelhameed R.E.; Metwally R.A.,NA,,NA,In vivo and In vitro evaluation of the antifungal activity of the PGPR Bacillus amyloliquefaciens RaSh1 (MZ945930) against Alternaria alternata with growth promotion influences on Capsicum annuum L. plants,Microbial Cell Factories,NA,,NA,NA,English,,,,,NA,Antioxidant defense; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens RaSh1; Electron microscopy; Fungicides; Leaf spot disease; Plant growth,"Alternaria; Antifungal Agents; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; Capsicum; Fungicides, Industrial; electrolyte; fungicide; antifungal agent; Alternaria alternata; alternariosis; antagonistic effect; antifungal activity; antioxidant activity; Article; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens RaSh1; biological control agent; Capsicum annuum; cell structure; controlled study; endophytic fungus; enzyme activity; fungicidal activity; in vitro study; in vivo study; inoculation; leaf spot; microscopy; nonhuman; pepper; Piper (plant); plant growth; transmission electron microscopy; Alternaria; chemistry; microbiology; pepper","Botany and Microbiology Department, Faculty of Science, Zagazig University, Zagazig, 44519, Egypt","Soliman S.A., Botany and Microbiology Department, Faculty of Science, Zagazig University, Zagazig, 44519, Egypt; Abdelhameed R.E., Botany and Microbiology Department, Faculty of Science, Zagazig University, Zagazig, 44519, Egypt; Metwally R.A., Botany and Microbiology Department, Faculty of Science, Zagazig University, Zagazig, 44519, Egypt","R.A.

,,,Other,"Alternaria species isolated from different econiches produce a wide variety of biologically active metabolites. The aim of this article was the evaluation of the biological activity spectrum of the small-spored Alternaria species from different trophic groups (saprophytes, endophytes and plant pathogens) using screening of biologically active metabolites on a wide set of test organisms, and selection of promising strains-producers. Methods. Antibiotic, antifungal and phytotoxic activities of culture filtrates and chloroform extracts were determined by agar diffusion assay method. Results. 19% of cultural filtrates among of 64 studied strains showed the biological activity at least against one test organism. The most of these fungi belong to endophytic strains and were active against test plant pathogenic fungi, bacteria and algae. Chloroform extracts of cultural filtrates of 33% of fungi showed biological activity against at least to one test organism. The obtained extracts had specific activity mainly against certain test culture. These preparations selectively inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus B-909, Chlorella vulgaris 191 and Rizoctonia solani 16036. Conclusions. The screening of 64 strains of the Alternaria fungi isolated from different ecological niches allows concluding that they have low biological activity. Endophytic Alternaria strains were characterized by wider spectrum of activities than plant pathogenic and soil ones. They inhibited all test organisms except Gram negative bacteria and yeast-like fungi. The biologically active metabolites of endophytic Alternaria strains including high-molecular compounds play important role in mutual coexistence endophytic fungi and host-plants as well as their spread. Chloroform extracts of the soil saprophytes had comparably high activity especially against fungi and algae. Obviously these low-molecular compounds facilitate to adaptive survival of saprophytic fungi in soil habitats with high biodiversity. For further studies were selected two strains: highly phytotoxic A. brassicicola 2855 and A. longipes 16800 (an antagonist of S. aureus B-909). © 2018, Zabolotny Institute of Microbiology and Virology, NAS of Ukraine.

,,,Presence,"Although dark septate fungal endophytes (DSE) occur widely in association with plant roots in cold-stressed habitats, little is known of the taxonomic status of DSE in Antarctica. Here we investigate the phylogenetic affinities of DSE colonising the roots of Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica, the two maritime Antarctic vascular plant species. Two hundred and forty-three DSE were isolated from roots collected from 17 sites across a 1470 km transect through maritime and sub-Antarctica. The ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 nuclear ribosomal gene cluster of representative isolates was sequenced, and the sequences were recovered in 10 sequence groups and sub-groups. Nine of the sequence groupings could be placed in the Helotiales and the remaining one showed high homology to a large number of currently unassigned anamorphic ascomycete sequences. Of the Helotiales, Leptodontidium orchidicola, Rhizoscyphus ericae and species of Tapesia and Mollisia could be confidently identified. This study demonstrates that members of the Helotiales, including several widely-recognised DSE genera, commonly colonise the roots of C. quitensis and D. antarctica in the Antarctic.

,,,Presence,"Although roots of species in the Pinaceae are usually colonized by ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi, there are increasing reports of the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungi in these species. The objective of this study was to determine the colonization patterns in seedlings of three Pinus (pine) species (Pinus banksiana, Pinus strobus, Pinus contorta) and Picea glauca x Picea engelmannii (hybrid spruce) grown in soil collected from a disturbed forest site. Seedlings of all three pine species and hybrid spruce became colonized by EM, AM, and DSE fungi. The dominant EM morphotype belonged to the E-strain category; limited colonization by a Tuber sp. was found on roots of Pinus strobus and an unknown morphotype (cf. Suillus-Rhizopogon group) with thick, cottony white mycelium was present on short roots of all species. The three fungal categories tended to occupy different niches in a single root system. No correlation was found between the percent root colonized by EM and percent colonization by either AM or DSE, although there was a positive correlation between percent root length colonized by AM and DSE. Hyphae and vesicles were the only AM intracellular structures found in roots of all species; arbuscules were not observed in any roots. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Wagg C.; Pautler M.; Massicotte H.B.; Peterson R.L.,,Wagg C.; Pautler M.; Massicotte H.B.; Peterson R.L.,NA,,NA,"The co-occurrence of ectomycorrhizal, arbuscular mycorrhizal, and dark septate fungi in seedlings of four members of the Pinaceae",Mycorrhiza,NA,,NA,NA,English,,,,,NA,Conifers; Fungal endophytes; Mycorrhiza; Symbiosis,"Fungi; Mycorrhizae; Picea; Pinus; Plant Roots; Seedling; Trees; Arbuscular; Coniferophyta; Fungi; Picea; Picea engelmannii; Picea glauca; Pinaceae; Pinus banksiana; Pinus contorta; Pinus strobus; Rhizopogon; Suillus; Tuber (truffle); arbuscular mycorrhiza; colonization; coniferous tree; ectomycorrhiza; forest soil; fungus; seedling; article; fungus; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; microbiology; mycorrhiza; pine; plant root; seedling; spruce; tree","Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; Ecosystem Science and Management Program, University of Northern British Columbia, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, 3333 University Way, Canada","Wagg C., Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; Pautler M., Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada; Massicotte H.B., Ecosystem Science and Management Program, University of Northern British Columbia, Prince George, BC V2N 4Z9, 3333 University Way, Canada; Peterson R.L., Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada","R.L.

,,,Other,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are widespread soil endophytic fungi, forming mutualistic relationships with the vast majority of land plants. Biochar (BC) has been reported to improve soil fertility and promote plant growth. However, limited studies are available concerning the combined effects of AMF and BC on soil community structure and plant growth. In this work, a pot experiment was designed to investigate the effects of AMF and BC on the rhizosphere microbial community of Allium fistulosum L. Using Illumina high-throughput sequencing, we showed that inoculation of AMF and BC had a significant impact on soil microbial community composition, diversity, and versatility. Increases were observed in both plant growth (the plant height by 8.6%, shoot fresh weight by 12.1%) and root morphological traits (average diameter by 20.5%). The phylogenetic tree also showed differences in the fungal community composition in A. fistulosum. In addition, Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) analysis revealed that 16 biomarkers were detected in the control (CK) and AMF treatment, while only 3 were detected in the AMF + BC treatment. Molecular ecological network analysis showed that the AMF + BC treatment group had a more complex network of fungal communities, as evidenced by higher average connectivity. The functional composition spectrum showed significant differences in the functional distribution of soil microbial communities among different fungal genera. The structural equation model (SEM) confirmed that AMF could improve the microbial multifunctionality by regulating the rhizosphere fungal diversity and soil properties. Our findings provide new information on the effects of AMF and biochar on plants and soil microbial communities.","Ji, CX; Li, YY; Xiao, QC; Li, ZS; Wang, BY; Geng, XW; Lin, KQ; Zhang, Q; Jin, Y; Zhai, YQ; Li, XY; Chen, J",,"Ji, CX; Li, YY; Xiao, QC; Li, ZS; Wang, BY; Geng, XW; Lin, KQ; Zhang, Q; Jin, Y; Zhai, YQ; Li, XY; Chen, J",NA,NA,NA,Combined Application Effects of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi and Biochar on the Rhizosphere Fungal Community of <i>Allium fistulosum</i> L.,JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Chen, Jin/GXW-0100-2022","Chen, Jin/0000-0002-0123-5093",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1017-7825,1738-8872,NA,NA,AUG,2023,,33,8,NA,NA,NA,1013,1022,10.4014/jmb.2303.03026,http://dx.doi.org/10.4014/jmb.2303.03026,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37435864,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001162377600004,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,901

,,,Presence,"Background Symbiotic associations of endophytic fungi have been proved by possessing an ability to produce hormones and metabolites for their host plant. Members of the Orchidaceae are obligate mycorrhizal species but a non-mycorrhizal association needs more investigation for their ability to promote plant growth and produce plant growth hormones. In the present study, endophytic fungi were isolated from the roots of Dendrobium longicornu Lindl., to investigate the root colonizing activity and role in plant growth and development. Results Among 23 fungal isolates were identified both by morphological and molecular technique as Penicillium sp., Fusarium sp., Coniochaeta sp., Alternaria sp., and Cladosporium sp. The dominate species were Coniochaeta sp. and Cladosporium sp. The dominant species as per the isolation was Coniochaeta sp. These fungal strains were screened for growth-promoting activity of Cymbidium aloifolium (plantlet) consider as cross genus interaction and Dendrobium longicornu (protocorms) as a host plant in in-vitro condition. Importantly, Cladosporium sp., and Coniochaeta sp. showed successful colonization and peloton formation with roots of C. aloifolium. Moreover, it also enhanced acclimatization of plantlets. Fungal elicitors from nine fungal isolates enhanced the growth of the in vitro grown protocorms of D. longicornu. Key bioactive compounds detected in the fungal colonized plant extract were 2H-pyran-2-one, Cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, Oleic Acid and d-Mannitol, which may have a potential role in plant-microbe interaction. All fungal endophytes were able to synthesize the indole acetic acid (IAA) in presence of tryptophan. Moreover, fungal extract DLCCR7 treated with DL-tryptophan yielded a greater IAA concentration of 43 mu g per ml than the other extracts. The iaaM gene involved in IAA synthesis pathway was amplified using iaaM gene primers successfully from Alternaria sp., Cladosporium sp., and Coniochaeta sp. Conclusions Hence, this study confirms the production of IAA by endophytes and demonstrated their host as well as cross-genus plant growth-promoting potential by producing metabolites required for the growth of the plant.","Shah, S; Shah, B; Sharma, R; Rekadwad, B; Shouche, YS; Sharma, J; Pant, B",,"Shah, S; Shah, B; Sharma, R; Rekadwad, B; Shouche, YS; Sharma, J; Pant, B",NA,NA,NA,Colonization with non-mycorrhizal culturable endophytic fungi enhances orchid growth and indole acetic acid production,BMC MICROBIOLOGY,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"shah, sujit/ACS-0932-2022; SHARMA, ROHIT/JOZ-6961-2023; Rekadwad, Bhagwan/A-1752-2011","Sharma, Rohit/0000-0001-9351-0525; Shah, Sujit/0000-0002-6175-5242",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1471-2180,NA,NA,NA,13-Apr,2022,,22,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1186/s12866-022-02507-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12866-022-02507-z,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35418028,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000782422400002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1090
,,,Presence,"Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is one of the most important cereal crop in the world, and is also the one being seriously affected by heavy metals, particularly aluminium (Al). Keeping in view the utility of barley as food, fodder and raw material for traditional beer brewing, the top-notch quality and higher production of this crop must be sustained. Phosphorus (P) has a quintessential role in plant growth with a potential to relieve symptoms caused by Al poisoning. Displaying a phytopromotive and stress alleviatory potential, Piriformospora indica (P. indica) can improve the stress tolerance in crops. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the mechanism of Al translocation in a variety of crops including barley, however, the bio-remediative studies related to detoxification and/or sequestration of metals are scarce. Therefore, the current study was carried out to elucidate the tolerance mechanism of an Al-sensitive barley cultivar ZU9 following the colonization with P. indica and exogenous P supply by physio-biochemical, elemental, leaf ultrastructural and root proteome an-alyses. When compared to the Al alone treated counterparts, the Al + P + P.i treated plants exhibited 4.1-, 1.38-, 2.7 and 1.35-fold improved root and shoot fresh and dry weights, respectively. With the provision of additional phosphorus, the content of P in the root and shoot for Al + P + P.i group was reportedly higher (71.6% and 49.5%, respectively) as compared to the control group. Moreover, inoculation of P. indica combined with P improved barley leaves' cell arrangement and also maintained normal cell wall shape. The root protemics experiment was divided into three groups: Al, Al + P.i and Al + P + P.i. In total, 28, 598, and 823 differentially expressed proteins were found in Al + P.i vs. Al and Al + P + P.i vs. Al, and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis was the most prominently enriched pathway, which contributed significantly to the recuperating effects of P-P. indica interaction. Conslusively, it was found that the percentage of protein related to peroxidase was 70/359 (Al + P + P.i vs. Al) and 92/447 (Al + P + P.i vs. Al + P.i), respectively, which indicated that P. indica in combination with P might be involved in the regulation of peroxidases, increasing the adaptability of barley plants by enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging mechansism.","Feng, QD; Sehar, S; Zhou, FR; Wei, DM; Askri, SMH; Ma, ZX; Adil, MF; Shamsi, IH",,"Feng, QD; Sehar, S; Zhou, FR; Wei, DM; Askri, SMH; Ma, ZX; Adil, MF; Shamsi, IH",NA,NA,NA,Physiological and TMT-based quantitative proteomic responses of barley to aluminium stress under<i> phosphorus-Piriformospora</i><i> indica</i> interaction,PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"ASKRI, SYED MUHAMMAD HASSAN/ITU-6108-2023; Sehar, Shafaque/JZU-0844-2024; Adil, Muhammad Faheem/AHE-2507-2022","Askri, Syed Muhammad Hassan/0000-0002-9104-8653; Sehar, Shafaque/0000-0003-4606-0175; Adil, Muhammad Faheem/0000-0001-5570-4433",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0981-9428,1873-2690,NA,NA,MAR,2023,,196,NA,NA,NA,NA,634,646,10.1016/j.plaphy.2023.02.015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.plaphy.2023.02.015,NA,23-Feb,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36791535,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000944473600001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1381
,,,Presence,"Beneficial plant-associated microorganisms, such as fungal endophytes, are key partners that normally improve plant survival under different environmental stresses. It has been shown that microorganisms from extreme environments, like those associated with the roots of Antarctica plants, can be good partners to increase the performance of crop plants and to restore endangered native plants. Nothofagus alessandrii and N. glauca, are among the most endangered species of Chile, restricted to a narrow and/or limited distributional range associated mainly to the Maulino forest in Chile. Here we evaluated the effect of the inoculation with a fungal consortium of root endophytes isolated from the Antarctic host plant Colobanthus quitensis on the ecophysiological performance [photosynthesis, water use efficiency (WUE), and growth] of both endangered tree species. We also, tested how Antarctic root-fungal endophytes could affect the potential distribution of N. alessandrii through niche modeling. Additionally, we conducted a transplant experiment recording plant survival on 2 years in order to validate the model. Lastly, to evaluate if inoculation with Antarctic endophytes has negative impacts on native soil microorganisms, we compared the biodiversity of fungi and bacterial in the rhizospheric soil of transplanted individuals of N. alessandrii inoculated and non-inoculated with fungal endophytes. We found that inoculation with root-endophytes produced significant increases in N. alessandrii and N. glauca photosynthetic rates, water use efficiencies and cumulative growth. In N. alessandrii, seedling survival was significantly greater on inoculated plants compared with non-inoculated individuals. For this species, a spatial distribution modeling revealed that, inoculation with root-fungal endophytes could potentially increase the current distributional range by almost threefold. Inoculation with root-fungal endophytes, did not reduce native rhizospheric microbiome diversity. Our results suggest that the studied consortium of Antarctic root-fungal endophytes improve the ecophysiological performance as well as the survival of inoculated trees and can be used as a biotechnological tool for the restoration of endangered tree species.","Torres-Díaz, C; Valladares, MA; Acuña-Rodríguez, IS; Ballesteros, GI; Barrera, A; Atala, C; Molina-Montenegro, MA",,"Torres-Díaz, C; Valladares, MA; Acuña-Rodríguez, IS; Ballesteros, GI; Barrera, A; Atala, C; Molina-Montenegro, MA",NA,NA,NA,Symbiotic Interaction Enhances the Recovery of Endangered Tree Species in the Fragmented Maulino Forest,FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ballesteros, Gabriel/IAN-7082-2023; Valladares, Moisés/Q-5088-2019; Valladares, Moises A./N-1152-2017","Torres Diaz, Cristian/0000-0002-5741-5288; Valladares, Moises A./0000-0002-0294-174X; Atala, Cristian/0000-0003-1337-9534",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-462X,NA,NA,NA,15-Apr,2021,,12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3389/fpls.2021.663017,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.663017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33936153,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000645024100001,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1410
,,,Presence,"Certain species of the Pooideae subfamily develop stress tolerance and herbivory resistance through symbiosis with vertically transmitted, asexual fungi. This symbiosis is specific, and genetic factors modulate the compatibility between partners. Although gene flow is clearly a fitness trait in allogamous grasses, because it injects hybrid vigor and raw material for evolution, it could reduce compatibility and thus mutualism effectiveness. To explore the importance of host genetic background in modulating the performance of symbiosis, Lolium multiflorum plants, infected and noninfected with Neotyphodium occultans, were crossed with genetically distant plants of isolines (susceptible and resistant to diclofop-methyl herbicide) bred from two cultivars and exposed to stress. The endophyte improved seedling survival in genotypes susceptible to herbicide, while it had a negative effect on one of the genetically resistant crosses. Mutualism provided resistance to herbivory independently of the host genotype, but this effect vanished under stress. While no endophyte effect was observed on host reproductive success, it was increased by interpopulation plant crosses. Neither gene flow nor herbicide had an important impact on endophyte transmission. Host fitness improvements attributable to gene flow do not appear to result in direct conflict with mutualism while this seems to be an important mechanism for the ecological and contemporary evolution of the symbiotum.","Gundel, PE; Martínez-Ghersa, MA; Omacini, M; Cuyeu, R; Pagano, E; Ríos, R; Ghersa, CM",,"Gundel, PE; Martínez-Ghersa, MA; Omacini, M; Cuyeu, R; Pagano, E; Ríos, R; Ghersa, CM",NA,NA,NA,Mutualism effectiveness and vertical transmission of symbiotic fungal endophytes in response to host genetic background,EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013","Omacini, Marina/0000-0003-1460-262X; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1752-4571,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2012,,5,8,NA,NA,NA,838,849,10.1111/j.1752-4571.2012.00261.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-4571.2012.00261.x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,23346228,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000312808900006,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1644
,,,Other,"Cowpea [(Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp)] is highly susceptible to the emerging guava root-knot nematode, Meloidogyne enterolobii, with available management options being limited due to the withdrawal of effective fumigant nematicides from the agrochemical markets. Filamentous fungi, available as Biocult (a.i. Glomus species + Trichoderma asperellum Lieckf and Nirenberg) and Nemafric-BL phytonematicide (a.i. cucurbitacin B) each improves plant growth and suppresses nematode population densities. However, when filamentous fungi like Biocult are combined with other biocontrol agents, the combined effects either have synergestic or antagonistic effects on the test variables. The combined effects of Biocult and cucurbitacin phytonematicides on plant growth and nematode suppression remain undocumented. The objective of this study was therefore to determine the combined effects of Biocult and Nemafric-BL phytonematicide on growth of cowpea var. Eureka and suppression of M. enterolobii population densities. Eureka was subjected to the effects of the two products in a 2 × 2 factorial experiment on a field infested with M. enterolobii. At harvest, the interaction of Biocult and Nemafric-BL phytonematicide was highly significant (P ≤ 0.01) on plant and nematode variables, with a two-way table used to assess the findings. Relative to untreated control, Biocult alone increased plant growth variables from 15 to 74%. Similarly, NemafricBL phytonematicide increased plant variables from 14 to 61%, whereas the combined effects significantly increased dry shoot mass (19%) and dry harvestable leaf mass (21%), but did not have significant effects on plant height and stem diameter. Relative to untreated control, Biocult alone reduced nematode eggs in root (80%), J2 in root (84%) and J2 in soil (53%), whereas the combined relative effects of the two products did not have significant effects on nematode population densities. In conclusion, Biocult and Nemafric-BL phytonematicide had antagonistic effects on growth of cowpea and suppression of M. enterolobii population densities and therefore, should be used separately in cowpea production.

,,,Presence,"Dark septate endophytes of the Phialocephala fortinii s.l. - Acephala applanata species complex (PAC) are abundant root colonizers of woody plants in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems where they form complex communities. Community structure was spatially stable for 3 years in a previous experiment, suggesting PAC's inability to disperse or mutual inhibition of neighboring PAC genotypes. The aim of this study was to test whether changes in PAC community structure occur at all. The community structure originally determined in 2004 was reassessed in 2014 in a Norway-spruce plantation using microsatellite genotyping. Most isolates belonged to Phialocephala turicensis, P. letzii, P. europaea, and P. helvetica in both years. P. uotilensis and Acephala applanata were rare. PAC species were the same at only two grid points in both years. P. europaea was more frequent than P. turicensis in 2004 whereas the situation was opposite in 2014. Only four of the 22 genotypes in 2004 were found in 2014. Interestingly, none of the genotypes was detected at the same grid points in both years. Extended sampling in 2014 led to a significantly higher number of grid points testing positive for the presence of P. turicensis and P. helvetica. More than 3 years are required to detect shifts in PAC community structures. The observed shifts suggest that PAC are able to disperse in soil or via root networks, though very slowly.","Stroheker, S; Queloz, V; Sieber, TN",,"Stroheker, S; Queloz, V; Sieber, TN",NA,NA,NA,Spatial and temporal dynamics in the <i>Phialocephala fortinii</i> s.l. - <i>Acephala applanata</i> species complex (PAC),PLANT AND SOIL,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sieber, Thomas/JBJ-5736-2023","Queloz, Valentin/0000-0002-1888-4882",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0032-079X,1573-5036,NA,NA,OCT,2016,,407,2-Jan,NA,NA,NA,231,241,10.1007/s11104-015-2790-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-015-2790-0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000385205100017,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1985
,,,Presence,"Despite their minute biomass, microbial symbionts of plants potentially alter herbivory, diversity and community structure. Infection of grasses by asexual endophytic fungi often decreases herbivore loads and alters arthropod diversity. However, most studies to date have involved agronomic grasses and often consider only infection status (infected vs. uninfected), without explicitly measuring endophyte-produced alkaloids, which vary among endophyte isolates and may impact consumers. We combined field experiments and population surveys to investigate how endophyte infection and associated alkaloids influence abundances, species richness, evenness and guild structure of arthropod communities on a native grass, Achnatherum robustum (sleepygrass). Surprisingly, we found that endophyte-produced alkaloids were associated with increased herbivore abundances and species richness. Our results suggest that, unlike what has been found in agronomic grass systems, high alkaloid levels in native grasses may not protect host grasses from arthropod herbivores, and may instead more negatively affect natural enemies of herbivores.

,,,Presence,"Development of the kiwifruit industry has been severely hindered by the canker disease, which is caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. Actinidiae (Psa). However, endophytic fungi associated with healthy kiwi plants may protect host plants through the production of metabolites with potent anti-Psa activity. In the current study, four undescribed isobenzofuranones, namely sporulactones A-D, two undescribed isocoumarins, namely sporulactones E and F, together with eight known analogs were isolated from the kiwi endophytic fungus Paraphaeosphaeria sporulosa. The structures with absolute configurations were established by extensive spectroscopic methods, quantum chemistry calculations, and X-ray diffraction experiments. In addition, five of the compounds exhibited anti-Psa activity, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging from 25 to 100 mu g/mL. These findings suggest that the small polyketide metabolites produced by P. sporulosa play an important role in the antibacterial properties of the endophyte.","Chen, Q; Yu, JJ; He, J; Feng, T; Liu, JK",,"Chen, Q; Yu, JJ; He, J; Feng, T; Liu, JK",NA,NA,NA,Isobenzofuranones and isocoumarins from kiwi endophytic fungus <i>Paraphaeosphaeria sporulosa</i> and their antibacterial activity against <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> pv. <i>actinidiae</i>,PHYTOCHEMISTRY,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"冯, 涛/GWZ-6797-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0031-9422,1873-3700,NA,NA,MAR,2022,,195,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1016/j.phytochem.2021.113050,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phytochem.2021.113050,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34906836,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000761012300003,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2054
,,,Presence,"Diverse fungi live all or part of their life cycle inside plants as asymptomatic endophytes. While endophytic fungi are increasingly recognized as significant components of plant fitness, it is unclear how they interact with plant cells; why they occur throughout the fungal kingdom; and why they are associated with most fungal lifestyles. Here we evaluate the diversity of endophytic fungi that are able to form novel protoplasts called mycosomes. We found that mycosomes cultured from plants and phylogenetically diverse endophytic fungi have common morphological characteristics, express similar developmental patterns, and can revert back to the free-living walled state. Observed with electron microscopy, mycosome ontogeny within Aureobasidium pullulans may involve two organelles: double membrane-bounded promycosome organelles (PMOs) that form mycosomes, and multivesicular bodies that may form plastid-infecting vesicles. Cultured mycosomes also contain a double membrane-bounded organelle, which may be homologous to the A. pullulans PMO. The mycosome PMO is often expressed as a vacuole-like organelle, which alternatively may contain a lipoid body or a starch grain. Mycosome reversion to walled cells occurs within the PMO, and by budding from lipid or starch-containing mycosomes. Mycosomes discovered in chicken egg yolk provided a plant-independent source for analysis: they formed typical protoplast stages, contained fungal ITS sequences and reverted to walled cells, suggesting mycosome symbiosis with animals as well as plants. Our results suggest that diverse endophytic fungi express a novel protoplast phase that can explain their hidden existence, lifestyle switching, and diversity within the plant kingdom. Importantly, our findings outline ""what, where, when and how'', opening the way for cell and organelle-specific tests using in situ DNA hybridization and fluorescent labels. We discuss developmental, ecological and evolutionary contexts that provide a robust framework for continued tests of the mycosome phase hypothesis.","Atsatt, PR; Whiteside, MD",,"Atsatt, PR; Whiteside, MD",NA,NA,NA,"Novel Symbiotic Protoplasts Formed by Endophytic Fungi Explain Their Hidden Existence, Lifestyle Switching, and Diversity within the Plant Kingdom",PLOS ONE,NA,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Atsatt, Peter/Q-8529-2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1932-6203,NA,NA,NA,28-Apr,2014,,9,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0095266,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0095266,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24777121,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000346241800010,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2115

The active antioxidant ingredients from the fermentation broth of endophytes and mycelium extract were studied. Potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium and Gauze's medium were used to isolate the endophytic fungi and endophytic actinomycetes, respectively. The antioxidant activities of all extracts were measured, the total phenolic and total flavonoid content of the extracts from those endophytes were compared, and high-activity strains were identified using morphological and molecular biological methods. Finally, 43 endophytic fungal strains and 18 endophytic actinomycete strains were isolated. Among them, the endophytic fungi had good antioxidant activity, and six strains (9.84%) showed a strong ·OH free radical scavenging capacity (clearance rate ≥70%).

Seed-vectored endophytic fungi establish an everlasting association with seeds and travel from generation to generation. To explore the composition and diversity of endophytic fungi in Alpinia zerumbet seeds, high-throughput Illumina MiSeq sequencing was employed for the following stages: fruit formation period (YSJ1), young fruit period (YSJ2), early mature period (YSJ3), middle mature period (YSJ4), and late mature period (YSJ5). A total of 906,694 sequence reads and 745 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained and further classified into 8 phyla, 30 classes, 73 orders, 163 families, 302 genera, and 449 species. The highest endophytic fungal diversity was observed at YSJ5. The genera with the highest abundance were Cladosporium, Kodamaea, Hannaella, Mycothermus, Gibberella, Sarocladium, and Neopestalotiopsis. Functional Guild (FUNGuild) analysis revealed that endophytic fungi were undefined saprotroph, plant pathogens, animal pathogen-endophyte-lichen parasite-plant pathogen-wood saprotroph, and soil saprotrophs. Alternaria, Fusarium, Cladosporium, and Sarocladium, which are potential probiotics and can be used as biocontrol agents, were also abundant.

Currently, supply of high-yield, high-quality A. lancea is mainly achieved via cultivation. Certain soil microbes can benefit plant growth, secondary metabolism and induce resistance to environmental stresses. Hence, studies on the effects of soil microbe communities and isolates microorganisms on A. lancea is extremely meaningful for future application of microbes on cultivation. Here we investigated the effects of the inoculation with an entire soil microbial community on the growth, resistance to drought, and accumulation of major medicinal compounds (hinesol, beta-eudesmol, atractylon and atractylodin) of A. lancea. We analyzed the interaction between A. lancea and the soil microbes at the phylum and genus levels under drought stress of different severities (inflicted by 0%, 10% and 25% PEG6000 treatments). Our results showed that inoculation with soil microbes promoted the growth, root biomass yield, medicinal compound accumulation, and rendered drought-resistant traits of A. lancea, including relatively high root:shoot ratio and high root water content under drought. Moreover, our results suggested drought stress was more powerful than the selectivity of A. lancea in shaping the root-associated microbial communities; also, the fungal communities had a stronger role than the bacterial communities in protecting A. lancea from drought. Specific microbial clades that might have a role in protecting A. lancea from drought stress were identified: at the genus level, the rhizospheric bacteria Bacillus, Dylla and Actinomadura, and rhizospheric fungi Chaetomium, Acrophialophora, Trichoderma and Thielava, the root endophytic bacteria Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia, Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium, Dylla and Actinomadura, and the root endophytic fungus Fusarium were closely associated with A. lancea under drought stress. Additionally, we acquired several endophytic Paenibacillus, Paraburkholderia and Fusarium strains and verified they had differential promoting effects on the medicinal compound accumulation in A. lancea root. This study reports the interaction between A. lancea and soil microbe communities under drought stress, and provides insights for improving the outcomes in A. lancea farming via applying microbe inoculation.",983,,,,,,Drought stress modifies the community structure of root-associated microbes that improve <i>Atractylodes lancea</i> growth and medicinal compound accumulation,FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022,,,,,,,,,10.3389/fpls.2022.1032480,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Remains of endophytic fungi found during the analysis are key indicators of the local presence of plants, which could have potentially been used by Neanderthal groups. The recording of high concentrations of Chaetomium-type (HdV-7A) in archaeological contexts from localized areas within the shelter suggests the local presence of decayed plants near an in situ fireplace. This could point to the use of grasses or other types of plants from aquatic or marshy areas such as reed and rushes for a surface preparation (bedding?) near the fireplace. Our research has also applied for the first time a combined study of archaeological sediments and pollen washes of artefacts following a microspatial approach in the study of Middle Palaeolithic archaeological contexts. One artefact (1079), identified as a sidescrapper, provided positive results, with the recording of high concentrations of Diporotheca webbiae-type (HdV-143). We could identify the host plant of the fungal signature documented on the tool surface as alder roots by comparing archaeobotanical results with NPP analyses in modern surface samples. Following this, we have proposed the use of this Middle Palaeolithic sidescrapper for processing this plant by Neanderthal groups. Marsh and riparian ecosystems were thus attractive for Neanderthals occupying the Abri du Maras. This study clearly shows that NPP must be considered as key taphonomical, environmental and cultural indicators in archaeobotanical analyses. It also underlines the contribution of combined studies of archaeological sediments and pollen washes of artefacts following a microspatial approach to a better understanding of Middle Palaeolithic lithic tools and plant use relationships.",8430,,,,,,"Neanderthal plant use and stone tool function investigated through non pollen palynomorphs analyses and pollen washes in the Abri du Maras, South-East France",JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,,,,,,,,,10.1016/j.jasrep.2020.102569,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,8/12/2025,model_absences_loose,Review,"Until a viable alternative can be accessible, the emergence of resistance to antimicrobials requires the constant development of new antibiotics. Recent scientific efforts have been aimed at the bioprospecting of microorganisms' secondary metabolites, with special emphasis on the search for antimicrobial natural products derived from endophytes. Endophytes are microorganisms that inhabit the internal tissues of plants without causing apparent harm to the plant. The present review article compiles recent (2006-2016) literature to provide an update on endophyte research aimed at finding metabolites with antibiotic activities. We have included exclusively information on endophytes that produce metabolites capable of inhibiting the growth of bacterial, fungal and protozoan pathogens of humans, animals and plants. Where available, the identified metabolites have been listed. In this review, we have also compiled a list of the bacterial and fungal phyla that have been isolated as endophytes as well as the plant families from which the endophytes were isolated. The majority of endophytes that produce antibiotic metabolites belong to either phylum Ascomycota (kingdom Fungi) or to phylum Actinobacteria (superkingdom Bacteria). Endophytes that produce antibiotic metabolites were predominant, but certainly not exclusively, from the plant families Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, Asteraceae and Araceae, suggesting that endophytes that produce antimicrobial metabolites are not restricted to a reduced number of plant families. The locations where plants (and inhabiting endophytes) were collected from, according to the literature, have been mapped, showing that endophytes that produce bioactive compounds have been collected globally.

From the leaves and stems of E. rubrum, 83 endophytic fungal isolates were recovered and identified using molecular biology taxonomy methods within 18 genera and 24 different taxa. Fungi from the Leotiomycetes class were the most abundant, followed by those of Dothideomycetes, Sordariomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, and Pezizomycetes. Phacidium, Allantophomopsis, Preussia, and Cladosporium were the most abundant genera. In addition, 18 taxa were detected as singlets representing rare taxa within the fungal assemblages. From the stem tissues of E. rubrum, 11 exclusive fungal genera from 15 taxa were recovered. In contrast, six fungal genera and seven taxa were identified in the leaves. Only endophytic Phacidium pseudophacidioides was found in the stem and leaf tissues. Our results showed that the tissues of E. rubrum, a medicinal species from austral South America, harbored a diverse endophytic fungal assemblage similar to those reported for the plants in the Ericaceae family from temperate regions.

Soil treatment with synthetic nematicides has given some protection and enhanced tomato yields, but health hazards and environmental pollution are obstructing their intensive use. Moreover, some of such nematicides are being banned from the market. Therefore, safe biological control agents (BCAs) and their bioactive compounds should better be researched and developed to effectively replace hazardous nematicides. Abamectin, produced during the fermentation process of the actinomycete Streptomyces avermitilis, is recommended to manage PPNs of tomato in Egypt but further exploration should allocate where BCAs can reliably act with other agricultural inputs. Examples are given herein to streamline their development via synergistic interaction with compatible inputs such as chemicals and organic manure.

,8/12/2025,model_absences_loose,Review,"Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) synthesized through biogenic methods have gained significant attention due to their unique properties and potential applications in various biological fields. Unlike chemical and physical approaches that may lead to environmental pollution, biogenic synthesis offers a greener alternative, minimizing hazardous environmental impacts. During biogenic synthesis, metabolites present in the biotic sources (like plants and microbes) serve as bio-reductants and bio-stabilizers. Among the biotic sources, microbes have emerged as a promising option for ZnO-NPs synthesis due to their numerous advantages, such as being environmentally friendly, non-toxic, biodegradable, and biocompatible. Various microbes like bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, and yeast can be employed to synthesize ZnO-NPs. The synthesis can occur either intracellularly, within the microbial cells, or extracellularly, using proteins, enzymes, and other biomolecules secreted by the microbes. The main key advantage of biogenic synthesis is manipulating the reaction conditions to optimize the preferred shape and size of the ZnO-NPs. This control over the synthesis process allows tailoring the NPs for specific applications in various fields, including medicine, agriculture, environmental remediation, and more. Some potential applications include drug delivery systems, antibacterial agents, bioimaging, biosensors, and nano-fertilizers for improved crop growth. While the green synthesis of ZnO-NPs through microbes offers numerous benefits, it is essential to assess their toxicological effects, a critical aspect that requires thorough investigation to ensure their safe use in various applications.

However, recent studies highlight concerns about antibiotic resistance determinants in animal excrements, posing a potential risk of spreading antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in agricultural soil and, consequently, in food products. This study examines the dissemination of ARGs within the soil and plant-associated microbiomes in cherry radish following the application of swine and bovine slurry. In a 45-day pot experiment, slurry-amended soil, rhizospheric bacteria, and endophytic bacteria in radish roots and leaves were sampled and analyzed for 21 ARGs belonging to 7 Antibiotic Resistance Phenotypes (ARPs). The study also assessed slurry's impact on soil microbiome functional diversity, enzymatic activity, physicochemical soil parameters, and the concentration of 22 selected antimicrobials in soil and plant tissues. Tetracyclines and β-lactams were the most frequently identified ARGs in bovine and swine slurry, aligning with similar studies worldwide. Swine slurry showed a higher prevalence of ARGs in soil and plant-associated bacteria, particularly TET genes, reflecting pig antibiotic treatments. The persistent dominance of TET genes across slurry, soil, and plant microbiomes highlights significant influence of slurry application on gene occurrence in plant bacteria. The presence of ARGs in edible plant parts underscores health risks associated with raw vegetable consumption. Time-dependent dynamics of ARG occurrence highlighted their persistent presence throughout the experiment duration, influenced by the environmental factors and antibiotic residuals. Notably, ciprofloxacin, which was the only one antimicrobial detected in fertilized soil, significantly impacted bovine-amended variants. Soil salinity modifications induced by slurry application correlated with changes in ARG occurrence.

While it is clear that not all fungi descend from endophytic ancestors, the prevalence and diversity of endophytism across the fungal phylogeny suggest that this lifestyle has evolved multiple times in response to various ecological and host-specific pressures. Future research, integrating modern genomic tools and experimental approaches, will likely shed more light on the complex evolutionary trajectories of endophytic fungi, and potentially contribute to applications in agriculture, industry, and medicine. © (2024), (Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences).

[Methods]1-year-old and 2-year-old of healthy and root rot-diseased P. notoginseng were randomly collected and the endophytic fungi in their roots and stems were isolated by tissue isolation method. Based on morphological characteristics and ITS sequence analysis,the isolated strains were classified and identified,and the community composition and diversity of endophytic fungal community were analyzed. [Results]A total of 966 endophytic fungi strains were isolated and identified,which belonged to 3 phyla, 5 classes,14 orders,25 families and 31 genera. The number and isolation rate of endophytic isolates were as follows:diseased plant> healthy plant,2-year-old P. notoginseng >1-year-old P. notoginseng,root>stem. The composition of the culturable endophytic fungi in healthy and root rot-diseased P. notoginseng was quite different,of which the genus Aspergillus,Irpex,Chaetomium,and Penicillium were the dominant endophytic fungi in the healthy P. notoginseng,while the predominant culturable endophytic fungi of root rot-diseased P. notoginseng were Fusarium,Aspergillus,Talaromyces,Chaetomium,and Trichoderma. The composition and diversity of endophytic fungi of P. notoginseng was significantly affected by plant tissues. Specially,the isolation frequency of genus Fusarium from roots of root rot-diseased P. notoginseng was 52%,which was significantly higher than that from the stems of 11.2%. Beneficial fungi such as Trichoderma and Talaromyces were also frequently isolated from diseased roots,with the isolation frequencies of 11.0% and 14.5%, respectively. Moreover,the diversity,richness,and evenness of endophytic fungal community in stems of P. notoginseng were higher than those in roots. With the increase of growth years,the composition and diversity of endophytic fungal community of healthy and root rot-diseased P. notoginseng also changed,and the isolation frequency of Fusarium oxysporum and F. solani in diseased P. notoginseng increased greatly,reaching 14.5% and 32.9%,respectively. Furthermore,the diversity,richness,and evenness of endophytic fungal community in healthy P. notoginseng increased gradually with growth year,while the diversity and evenness of endophytic fungal community in root rot-diseased P. notoginseng were gradually declined. [ Conclusions] P. notoginseng harbored a rich diversity of endophytic fungi and its colonization quantity and community composition were significantly distinct between healthy and root rot-diseased plants. Moreover, plant tissues and growth ages also significantly affected the diversity and composition of endophytic fungal community. © 2024 Editorial Department of Journal of Nanjing Agricultural University.

We modeled the community-level outcomes of competition, using experimentally derived competitive effects and responses between an exotic invasive plant, Centaurea stoebe, and species from both its native and nonnative ranges and using changes in these effects and responses elicited by experimentally establishing symbioses between C. stoebe and fungal endophytes. Using relative interaction intensities (RIIs) and holding other life-history factors constant, individual-based and spatially explicit models predicted competitive exclusion of all but one North American species but none of the European species, regardless of the endophyte status of C. stoebe. Concomitantly, C. stoebe was eliminated from the models with European natives but was codominant in models with North American natives. Endophyte symbiosis predicted increased dominance of C. stoebe in North American communities but not in European communities. However, when experimental variation was included, some of the model outcomes changed slightly. Our results are consistent with the idea that the effects of competitive intensity and mutualisms measured at small scales have the potential to play important roles in determining the larger-scale outcomes of invasion and that the stabilizing indirect effects of competition may promote species coexistence.",9020,,,,,,Models of Experimental Competitive Intensities Predict Home and Away Differences in Invasive Impact and the Effects of an Endophytic Mutualist,AMERICAN NATURALIST,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2012,,,,,,,,,10.1086/668008,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The performance of these pasture grasses is supported by the fungal endophyte Epichloë spp. that has bioprotection activities, however, the broader microbiome is not well characterized. In this study, we characterized a novel bioprotectant Xanthomonas species isolated from perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L. cv. Alto). In vitro and in planta bioassays against key fungal pathogens of grasses (Sclerotium rolfsii, Drechslera brizae and Microdochium nivale) indicated strong bioprotection activities. A complete circular chromosome of ∼5.2 Mb was generated for three strains of the novel Xanthomonas sp. Based on the 16S ribosomal RNA gene, the strains were closely related to the plant pathogen Xanthomonas translucens, however, comparative genomics of 22 closely related xanthomonad strains indicated that these strains were a novel species. The comparative genomics analysis also identified two unique gene clusters associated with the production of bioprotectant secondary metabolites including one associated with a novel nonribosomal peptide synthetase and another with a siderophore. The analysis also identified genes associated with an endophytic lifestyle (e.g., Type VI secretion system), while no genes associated with pathogenicity were identified (e.g., Type III secretion system and effectors). Overall, these results indicate that these strains represent a novel, bioactive, non-pathogenic species of the genus Xanthomonas.

Poa alsodes, North American woodland grass, independently hosts two species of EpichloA << that vary by produced alkaloids. E. alsodes produces insecticidal N-acetylnorloline. E. schardlii var. pennsylvanica (E. schardlii hereafter) has the gene for peramine, an insect-deterring alkaloid, production, but peramine was not detected. We tested the effects of the two endophytes on survival, feeding preference, and plant damage by the generalist herbivore, Spodoptera frugiperda. No larvae survived when feeding on plants harboring E. alsodes. In contrast, survival was only slightly reduced by plants harboring E. schardlii. However, larvae that fed on E. schardlii infected plants experienced delayed development and reduced pupal mass. Uninfected plants and plants infected with E. schardlii were damaged severely when single larvae fed upon them, whereas larvae fed negligibly on plants infected with E. alsodes. Preference did not match performance. Larvae strongly avoided feeding on E. schardlii but not E. alsodes-infected leaves where survival was zero. When E. schardlii was experimentally removed, larval leaf choices suggested that this endophyte is responsible for deterrence. High levels of N-acetylnorloline were detected from E. alsodes infected plants. Peramine was not detected in the experimental plants harboring E. schardlii, so it remains unclear what mechanisms caused avoidance and developmental delays.

Each of the 3 series received the nutrient solution at pH 4, 6, and 8. The plants that received ammonium at pH 6 and pH 8, and those that received glycine at pH 4 and pH 6, grew most vigorously, producing long stem growth, dark green foliage, and apparently healthy root systems. At pH 4 with ammonium and at pH 8 with glycine plants were stunted and chlorotic. The nitrate cultures producing the greatest stem growth were at pH 4. However, all of the nitrate cultures were inferior in vegetative growth to the glycine cultures at pH 4 and pH 6 and the ammonium cultures at pH 6 and pH 8. These results confirm the findings of Tiedjens and Bobbins with certain other plants, that in sand cultures nitrate can be utilized to best advantage in acid solutions, and ammonium in more nearly neutral or in alkaline solutions. Soil cultures indicate that in bog soil ammonium can be used at a somewhat lower pH than in sand. The difference may be attributable to the greater buffer properties of the bog soil. Mycelium of the endophytic fungus was found throughout the stem tissues, especially, in parenchyma and in the cells of embryonic tips. The amount of mycelium appears to be directly correlated with the vigor of vegetative growth. Analysis of bog plants showed a correlation between degree of vegetative vigor and concentration of fats and lipoids in the leaves, the most vigorously vegetative plants having the lowest concentration of ether-soluble substances.

Germination percentage, root and shoot length, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, antioxidant gene expression and protein content was examined in the F2 generation of pea (CDC Golden). The IOP-PDA and PEG media increased water stress, osmotic pressure and dehydration, respectively, to plants grown in vitro. The transgenerational endophyte-mediated benefits to pea can be appreciated by improved seed germination and reduced ROS accumulation levels in plant-roots. qPCR of antioxidants in leaves revealed downregulated proline, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) genes under water-deficient conditions. This finding implies that endophytes can improve pea's resilience to abiotic stresses.

Nervilia fordii is a rare and endangered karst endemic plant that is used as medicine and food homology in Guangxi, China. These plants have been reported to have antimicrobial, antitumor, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory activities. However, few studies have focused on the diversity and antibacterial activity of endophytic fungi from N. fordii. In the present study, 184 endophytic fungi were isolated from the healthy tissues of N. fordii, and their molecular diversity and antimicrobial activities were analyzed for the first time. These fungi were categorized into 85 different morphotypes based on the morphological characteristics and the similarity between the target sequence and the reference sequence in the GenBank database. With the exception of 18 unidentified fungi, the fungal isolates belonged to at least 2 phyla, 4 classes, 15 orders, 45 known genera, and 45 different species, which showed high abundance, rich diversity, and obvious tissue specificity. All isolates were employed to screen for their antimicrobial activities via the agar diffusion method against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida tropicalis. Among these endophytes, eight strains (9.41%) displayed inhibitory activity against E. coli, 11 strains (12.94%) against S. aureus, and two strains (2.35%) against C. tropicalis, to some extent. In particular, our study showed for the first time that the fungal agar plugs of Penicillium macrosclerotiorum 1151# exhibited promising antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus.

The survival rate and leaf damage was significantly lower in endophyte-treated plants than control under stress. Control plants had significantly higher leaf damage which also coupled with increased level of electrolytes and lipid peroxidation under heat stress. Conversely, these effects were lower in P. resedanum-associated plants. The endophyte-inoculated plants had higher nutrients contents as compared to control plants.

,8/12/2025,model_absences_loose,Both,"Simple Summary Global change is driving the incidence of novel stress factors such as the tropospheric pollutant ozone. Plants can overcome the environmental challenges by adjusting their phenotypes that eventually, can be transmitted to the progeny. Plants also establish symbiotic interactions with beneficial fungal endophytes, some of which can be transmitted to the progeny through the seeds. We worked with the grass Lolium multiflorum and its common endophyte, Epichloe occultans that benefits the host by coffering resistance to herbivores. Specifically, we studied the effect of exposing endophyte-symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants to ozone on the level of resistance to herbivorous aphids in the progeny. The ozone history impaired the endophyte-conferred resistance to aphids in progeny. This was evident at individual weight level of aphids but not so at population level. Defensive compounds were higher in endophyte-symbiotic seeds but depressed by mother plants exposure to ozone. Despite the negative effect of maternal ozone on the resistance level of plants, symbiotic plants showed a superior biomass compared to endophyte-free plants. Our work illustrates how the environment explored by parent plants can persist transgenerationally and, depending on the symbiotic state, will affect the fate of the progeny. Plants are challenged by biotic and abiotic stress factors and the incidence of one can increase or decrease resistance to another. These relations can also occur transgenerationally. For instance, progeny plants whose mothers experienced herbivory can be more resistant to herbivores. Certain fungal endophytes that are vertically transmitted endow plants with alkaloids and resistance to herbivores. However, endophyte-symbiotic plants exposed to the oxidative agent ozone became susceptible to aphids. Here, we explored whether this effect persists transgenerationally. We exposed Lolium multiflorum plants with and without fungal endophyte Epichloe occultans to ozone (120 or 0 ppb), and then, challenged the progeny with aphids (Rhopalosiphum padi). The endophyte was the main factor determining the resistance to aphids, but its importance diminished in plants with ozone history. This negative ozone effect on the endophyte-mediated resistance was apparent on aphid individual weights. Phenolic compounds in seeds were increased by the symbiosis and diminished by the ozone. The endophyte effect on phenolics vanished in progeny plants while the negative ozone effect persisted. Independently of ozone, the symbiosis increased the plant biomass (approximate to 24%). Although ozone can diminish the importance of endophyte symbiosis for plant resistance to herbivores, it would be compensated by host growth stimulation.",6631,,,,,,Maternal Exposure to Ozone Modulates the Endophyte-Conferred Resistance to Aphids in <i>Lolium multiflorum</i> Plants,INSECTS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,,,,,,,,,10.3390/insects11090548,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,8/12/2025,model_absences_loose,Review,"Phytopathogenic microorganisms have caused blight diseases that present significant challenges to global agriculture. These diseases result in substantial crop losses and have a significant economic impact. Due to the limitations of conventional chemical treatments in effectively and sustainably managing these diseases, there is an increasing interest in exploring alternative and environmentally friendly approaches for disease control. Using endophytic fungi as biocontrol agents has become a promising strategy in recent years. Endophytic fungi live inside plant tissues, forming mutually beneficial relationships, and have been discovered to produce a wide range of bioactive metabolites. These metabolites demonstrate significant potential for fighting blight diseases and provide a plentiful source of new biopesticides. In this review, we delve into the potential of endophytic fungi as a means of biocontrol against blight diseases. We specifically highlight their significance as a source of biologically active compounds. The review explores different mechanisms used by endophytic fungi to suppress phytopathogens. These mechanisms include competing for nutrients, producing antifungal compounds, and triggering plant defense responses. Furthermore, this review discusses the challenges of using endophytic fungi as biocontrol agents in commercial applications. It emphasizes the importance of conducting thorough research to enhance their effectiveness and stability in real-world environments. Therefore, bioactive metabolites from endophytic fungi have considerable potential for sustainable and eco-friendly blight disease control.

S. tomento-alba exhibits notable in vitro effects, inhibiting B. cinerea growth by approximately 60% during co-culture and 50% in double disc co-culture. Additionally, it suppresses botryanes production and produces the compound heptacyclosordariolone, which has proven effective in inhibiting B. cinerea mycelial growth and spore germination in vitro.

Plants are threatened by pathogens, but they are even more commonly engaged in neutral or mutualistic interactions with microbes: belowground microbial plant associates are mycorrhizal fungi, Rhizobia, and plant-growth promoting rhizosphere bacteria, aboveground plant parts are colonized by internally living bacteria and fungi (endophytes) and by microbes in the phyllosphere (epiphytes). We emphasize here that a completely microbe-free plant is an exotic exception rather than the biologically relevant rule. The complex interplay of such microbial communities with the host plant affects multiple vital parameters such as plant nutrition, growth rate, resistance to biotic and abiotic stressors, and plant survival and distribution. The mechanisms involved reach from direct ones such as nutrient acquisition, the production of plant hormones, or direct antibiosis, to indirect ones that are mediated by effects on host resistance genes or via interactions at higher trophic levels. Plant-associated microbes are heterotrophic and cause costs to their host plant, whereas the benefits depend on the current environment. Thus, the outcome of the interaction for the plant host is highly context dependent. We argue that considering the microbe-free plant as the ""normal"" or control stage significantly impairs research into important phenomena such as (1) phenotypic and epigenetic plasticity, (2) the ""normal"" ecological outcome of a given interaction, and (3) the evolution of plants. For the future, we suggest cultivation-independent screening methods using direct PCR from plant tissue of more than one fungal and bacterial gene to collect data on the true microbial diversity in wild plants. The patterns found could be correlated to host species and environmental conditions, in order to formulate testable hypotheses on the biological roles of plant endophytes in nature.

It is unclear whether biological factors can modulate the parasitic and mutualistic traits of a fungus.

Because many of these fungi have only recently been discovered and sequenced, the independent and interactive responses of plants and their fungal symbionts to a warming climate is an area of active research. Here we describe a conceptual framework linking the range of phenotypic plasticity and rates of shifts in community composition of each symbiont (plants and fungal leaf endophytes) to overall changes in abundance of each organism in a 26-year-long warming experiment in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. In this system, leaf endophytic fungi exhibit large plasticity in growth rates in response to experimental warming in the laboratory, but no shifts in composition after 26years of warming in the field. Instead, fungal composition in the field changed in response to plant species composition. In contrast, the C3 grasses examined in this study shifted in composition in response to field warming within 4years. In addition, the abundance of individual fungi was much more variable among field temperatures than that of plants. Overall, we find support that fungi are potentially more phenotypically plastic in response to warming whereas plants are more likely to shift composition. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, host/fungus preference combinations and key species, such as hubs and connectors, in bipartite networks differed strikingly between aboveground and belowground samples.

As mycorrhizal fungi are closely associated with their host trees and provide them essential base cations and phosphorus, we hypothesize that they actively mine soil minerals and transfer their nutritive content to their host. Therefore, mycorrhizal fungi are expected to be important colonizers of soil mineral surfaces relative to other fungal trophic guilds. To test this hypothesis, 50 mu m nylon mesh bags were filled with three different mineral types (i.e. calcite, apatite and obsidian) and buried in the same soil colonized by three forest stands (i.e. beech, Corsican pine and coppice with standards). After an in situ incubation period of 29 months in the topsoil, mineral dissolution was detectable in the mesh bags, and the analysis of the fungal communities was therefore undertaken. Minerals presented a lower fungal biomass than the surrounding bulk soil and no difference between the three mineral types tested was observed. The high-throughput sequencing (HTS) approach showed that the fungal communities differed among the three forest stands, but in each case, mineral associated fungal taxa differed significantly from those in the bulk soil. To a lesser extent, fungal communities further varied between the three mineral types. Overall, trophic inference analyses suggested that two groups of plant-associated fungi, namely the ectomycorrhizal and endophytic fungi, were the major fungal mineral colonizers. Saprophytes also appeared significantly enriched on minerals comparatively to the surrounding bulk soil.

For this, a trap culture approach was used, were plants of four species were grown in the greenhouse until maturity in a soil mix originating from a prairie remnant. Root endophytic fungi were surveyed through amplicon sequencing of total root DNA, targeting universal fungal and arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) - specific ribosomal markers. Each host species studied enriched for different fungal community assemblages, with particular fungal lineages being differentially abundant across hosts. In general, wheat enriched for the greatest diversity of fungi, whereas vetch and clover were best for enrichment of AM fungi and oat for saprotrophs. Specific groups of fungi more abundant in wheat roots included members of the Sordariomycetes, mainly represented by the families Lasiosphaeriaceae, Magnaporthaceae and the order Pleosporales; whereas vetch recovered greater abundance of Hypocreales-like sequences, highly represented by the genus Ilyonectria. Within AM fungi differences in taxa recovery were observed between the orders Glomerales and Diversisporales across hosts, being these groups more abundant in wheat and vetch roots, respectively.

Most previous research has concentrated on agronomically important grasses, such as tall fescue, and its interactions with livestock grazers or invertebrate herbivores. In this study we focus on the woodland grass Brachypodium sylvaticum which is infected by the strictly host-specific endophyte Epichloe sylvatica. This fungus has two alternative modes of reproduction: the predominant asexual strains are seed-transmitted, whereas the rare sexual strains are capable of contagious spread by ascospores produced on stromata. To assess potential host protection from herbivory, we tested to what extent development of Spodoptera frugiperda, a noctuid generalist herbivore, was affected when fed on different genotypes of naturally infected (E+), artificially infected (F+), or uninfected (E-) leaf material of B, sylvaticum. In a feeding assay, insect larvae performed significantly better on a diet of uninfected leaves, even though previous studies have not detected alkaloid production by E. sylvatica. A possible explanation for this result may be the presence of an unknown compound in infected plants, acting as metabolic toxin against S. frugiperda larvae. The negative effect on insect larvae was increased when they were fed on a diet artificially infected by a particular genotype (F), suggesting that content of allelochemicals may depend on the fungal genotype. In a dual-choice test, neonate S. frugiperda larvae initially preferred uninfected seedlings over naturally infected seedlings, but only during the first 6 h of the experiment. This suggests that the unknown compounds can act as weak insect-feeding deterrents. To assess herbivory in natural stands of the host grass, nine infected populations of B. sylvaticum were examined for feeding damage. Damage due to micro herbivores and macroherbivores was equal in most populations. However, microherbivores (mostly insects) showed a clear preference for tillers bearing fungal stromata, whereas asymptomatically infected tillers were less damaged. Thus, herbivore resistance of infected plants appears to be correlated with the mode of reproduction of fungal genotypes. This result is of evolutionary significance, since asexual, seed-transmitted endophytes depend on host fitness and seed production for their dispersal.",2893,,,,,,Epichloe grass endophytes increase herbivore resistance in the woodland grass <i>Brachypodium sylvaticum</i>,OECOLOGIA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2001,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s004420000551,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The excessive use of synthetic agrochemicals, declining soil nutrients, and water-use issues, amongst others, are threats to the ecosystem. Additionally, environmental degradation and an increasing global population that will reach 9 billion by 2030 are further considerations. These issues mean a decline in the volume of food resources available to feed the world. Therefore, sustainably increasing agricultural productivity is a necessity for restoring soil fertility, feeding the populace, and improving the ecosystem. A way to achieve this is by using eco-friendly microbial inoculants. Endophytes inhabit the tissues of plants asymptomatically without causing adverse effects. Bacterial and fungal endophytes benefit plants by promoting growth, suppressing pathogens, and improving the stress tolerance and immunity of plants. Despite this vital role played by endophytes in their interactions with host plants, there is still a paucity of relevant review data. More importantly, the prospective use of endophytes as an alternative to synthetic agrochemicals to ensure agro-ecological crop productivity has not been well reviewed in the literature. Therefore, this review sought to highlight the potential use of endophytic microbial resources to achieve enhancements in agro-food system crops in a sustainable manner.",7316,,,,,,Bacterial and Fungal Endophytes: Tiny Giants with Immense Beneficial Potential for Plant Growth and Sustainable Agricultural Productivity,MICROORGANISMS,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019,,,,,,,,,10.3390/microorganisms7110481,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,8/12/2025,model_absences_loose,Review,"Microorganisms are proficient synthesizers of natural product molecules that are often bioactive and a source of various antibiotics and other pharmaceutical agents. The demand for new bioactive molecules is ever-increasing due to the emergence of new diseases, novel pathogens, and drug-resistant microbes. It is imperative to extend our search for molecules with novel bioactivities from unique and unexplored niches. Since the discovery of microbial Taxol (1), from a fungus inhabiting the tissues of Taxus brevifolia, endophytes, the microbes living within the plant tissues in mutualistic associations, have become an important source for the discovery of bioactive molecules. Since the endophytic associations are plant-specific, each plant forms a unique niche for the accumulation of a specific set of microbial species. The endophytes also pass through various stages of evolution within the plant system to evolve their natural product arsenal. Consequently, numerous plants are being analysed for the isolation and characterization of their endophytes for bioactive molecules and enzymes. Here, we report the progress of research and the current status of endophyte biology and biochemistry for the production of bioactive natural products. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",5071,,,,,,Fungal Endophytes: An Accessible Natural Repository for Discovery of Bioactive Compounds,Fungi Bioactive Metabolites: Integration of Pharmaceutical Applications,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2024,,,,,,,,,10.1007/978-981-99-5696-8_3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
