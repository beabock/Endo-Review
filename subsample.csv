1,Absence,"Entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) can be established as endophytes in the host plants to offer a long-term preventive measure for pests and diseases. This practice serves as a better alternative to the common practice of periodic direct application of EPF on plants or the target pests as a short-term defense strategy against pests and diseases. These fungal endophytes, aside from their role in pests and diseases prevention, also act as plant growth promoters. Several fungal endophytes have been associated with improvement in plant height, dry and wet weight and other growth parameters. However, many limiting factors have been identified as mitigating the successful colonization of the host plants by EPF. The inoculation methods used have been identified as one, but sadly, this has received little or less attention. Some previous studies carried out comparison between various artificial inoculation methods; foliar application, seedling dipping, soil drenching, seed inoculation, direct injection and others. In separate studies, some authors had suggested different application methods that are best suitable for certain fungal entomopathogens. For instance, leaf inoculation with conidial suspensions was suggested to be the best inoculation method for Beauveria bassiana in sorghum, stem injection was suggested as the most suitable for coffee, while, root dipping method proved the most successful for B. bassiana colonization of tomato plants for the management of Helicoverim armigera. Here, we discussed entomopathogenic fungal endophytes as bio-control agents, plant growth promoters and highlighted the effect of various artificial inoculation methods on their endophytic colonization of the host plants.",3252,"Bamisile, BS; Dash, CK; Akutse, KS; Keppanan, R; Afolabi, OG; Hussain, M; Qasim, M; Wang, LD",NA,NA,NA,"Bamisile, Bamisope Steve; Dash, Chandra Kanta; Akutse, Komivi Senyo; Keppanan, Ravindran; Afolabi, Oluwatoyin Grace; Hussain, Mubasher; Qasim, Muhammad; Wang, Liande",NA,Prospects of endophytic fungal entomopathogens as biocontrol and plant growth promoting agents: An insight on how artificial inoculation methods affect endophytic colonization of host plants,MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Dash, Chandra/F-9387-2018; BAMISILE, BAMISOPE/AAZ-1862-2021; Akutse, Komivi/I-8137-2019; Hussain, Mubasher/ITV-6682-2023; Qasim, Muhammad/T-9636-2019; Keppanan, ravindran/AFU-6241-2022; BAMISILE, BAMISOPE/IXW-8098-2023; Dash, Chandra Kanta/AEE-7164-2022","Qasim, Muhammad/0000-0002-8063-9140; Akutse, Komivi/0000-0002-2124-1626; BAMISILE, BAMISOPE/0000-0001-5163-3631; Dash, Chandra Kanta/0000-0003-0996-0537; Afolabi, Oluwatoyin Grace/0009-0000-0684-6275",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0944-5013,1618-0623,NA,NA,NA,NA,2018,217,NA,NA,NA,NA,34,50,NA,10.1016/j.micres.2018.08.016,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2018.08.016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30384907,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000451654900004,NA,3114

4,Absence,"IntroductionTechnological advances have made possible long space travels and even exoplanetary colonies in the future. Nevertheless, the success of these activities depends on our ability to produce edible plants in stressful conditions such as high radiation, extreme temperatures and low oxygen levels. Since beneficial microorganisms, such as fungal endophytes from extreme environments, have helped agriculture cope with those difficulties, endophytic fungi may be a putative tool to ensure plant growth under exoplanetary conditions. Additionally, growing crops in polyculture has been shown to increase productivity and spatial efficiency, which is essential given the likely space restrictions in such conditions. MethodsWe evaluated the effect of the inoculation with a mix of two fungal endophytes from the Atacama Desert on performance (survival and biomass) and nutritional quality of three crop species (lettuce, chard and spinach) grown under exoplanetary conditions. In addition, we measured the amount of antioxidants (flavonoids and phenolics) as possible mechanisms to cope with such abiotic conditions. The exoplanetary conditions were; high UV radiation, low temperature, low water availability, and low oxygen levels. These crops were put in growing chambers in monoculture, dual culture and polyculture (the three species in the same pot) for 30 days. Results and DiscussionOur results show that inoculation with extreme endophytes improved survival by ca. 15 - 35% and biomass by ca. 30 - 35% in all crop species. The most evident increase was when grown in polyculture, except for survival in spinach, where inoculated plants had higher survival only in dual culture. Nutritional quality and the amount of the antioxidant compounds antioxidants increased in all crop species when inoculated with the endophytes. Overall, fungal endophytes isolated from extreme environments such as the Atacama Desert, the driest desert in the world, could be a key biotechnological tool for future space agriculture, helping plants cope with environmental stress. Additionally, inoculated plants should be grown in polyculture to increase crop turnover and space-use efficiency. Lastly, these results provide useful insights to face the future challenges of space-farming.",4844,"Molina-Montenegro, MA; Escobedo, VM; Atala, C",NA,NA,NA,"Molina-Montenegro, Marco A.; Escobedo, Victor M.; Atala, Cristian",NA,Inoculation with extreme endophytes improves performance and nutritional quality in crop species grown under exoplanetary conditions,FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Escobedo, Víctor/AAV-9690-2021","Escobedo, Victor/0000-0003-2673-3803",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1664-462X,NA,NA,NA,NA,22-Jun,2023,14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3389/fpls.2023.1139704,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1139704,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37426965,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:001020038800001,NA,4648
5,Absence,"Within their tissues, plants host diverse communities of fungi, termed fungal endophytes. These fungi can affect plant growth, competitiveness, and resistance to stressors, thereby influencing plant community structure. Research characterizing fungal endophyte communities has so far mostly focused on seed plants, but information on the endophytes of other plant lineages is needed to understand how plant microbiomes impact whole ecosystems and how major changes through land plant evolution have affected plant-microbe relationships. In this study, we assess the fungal endophyte community of the model liverwort Marchantia polymorpha L. by both culturing and Illumina amplicon sequencing methods. We detect a very diverse fungal community that is distinct between M. polymorpha patches and only shares a few core fungi between populations across the United States. We also show low overlap in taxa detected by the different methods.

6,Absence,"The presence of endophytic fungi within symptomless leaves of vascular plants is usually recognised indirectly through culturing methods. In order to understand the biology of fungi isolated as endophytes, there is a need to directly observe their hyphae within the leaves of their hosts. Such observations provide information about the mode of infection, the extent of colonisation within the leaf, and the reaction of the plant to infection by the fungus. Many endophytic fungi develop highly localised infections with small amounts of mycelium, making such direct observations difficult.

7,Absence,"Endophytic fungi are an important component, are ubiquitous and occur within all know plants, including a broad range of hosts in various ecosystems, and therefore play an important role in the natural environment. More than 1 million species of endophytic fungi are estimated to exist based on a ratio of vascular plants to fungal species of 1:4 or 1:5. Nevertheless, our recognition of endophyte diversity is limited at present. In surveys of endophyte diversity, traditional techniques, such as cultivation-dependent methods, have been routinely used in previous studies. The discovery of endophytic fungi in natural environments, however, has been limited by traditional methodology due to some non-sporulating and non-culturable fungi. Molecular techniques, such as DNA fingerprinting and sequencing methods, have been successfully employed in the detection and identification of endophytic fungi, and different endophyte diversity and community composition have been documented by cultivation-dependent and molecular techniques.

8,Absence,"The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a genome-editing tool that allows for precise and efficient modifications to the DNA of a cell. This technology can be used in endophytic fungi, which live within plants and can have beneficial effects on their host, making them important for agriculture. Using CRISPR/Cas9, researchers can introduce specific genetic changes into endophytic fungal genomes, allowing them to study the function of genes, improve their plant-growth-promoting properties, and create new, more beneficial endophytes. This system works by using the Cas9 protein, which acts as a pair of molecular scissors, to cut DNA at specific locations determined by a guide RNA. Once the DNA is cut, the cell's natural repair mechanisms can be used to insert or delete specific genes, allowing for precise editing of the fungal genome.

9,Absence,"In the present study, bacterial and fungal endophytes are isolated from Calotropis procera, a drought-resistant plant and studied for their role in plant growth promotion. Among bacterial sp. Enterobacter cloacae subsp. cloacae strain CPR5B and fungus, Penicillium citrinum strain CPL1F, were identified as potent endophytes as both strains were able to produce Indole Acetic Acid (IAA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase and solubilize phosphate. Penicillium citrinum CPL1F also been shown to produce siderophore. The IAA production was observed to be 94.28 mu g/mL and 17.1 mu g/mL for bacterial and fungal sp., respectively. The phosphate solubilization was observed to be 76.41 mu g/mL and 114.57 mu g/mL, respectively. The in vitro plant treatment studies with bacterium and fungus under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions showed that both strains had promoted plant growth in both conditions with respect to their control. Both the strains showed significant changes in most of the growth parameters under endophyte-treated irrigated and non-irrigated conditions, suggesting their stress-dependent plant growth promotion.

10,Absence,"Fungal endophytes are an important part of the plant microbiome and participate in maintaining the stability of ecosystems. Culture-based methods are frequently considered in studying fungal communities because of their advantages in providing cultures for further experiments and their low cost. In comparison with next-generation sequencing methods, their ability to assess fungal diversity is questionable. Here, we show how using two different incubation temperatures can improve the yield of fungal endophytes by culture-based methods. Diversity, organ preference and spatiotemporal variability of endophytic fungal communities living within Quercus brantii L. were investigated using two different incubation temperatures. To test the effects of using low-temperature incubation on diversity estimations, twigs and leaves of Quercus brantii were incubated under 25 degrees C and 4 degrees C conditions. Isolation rate and Hill's series of diversity were calculated for each sample. Model-based analysis was used to evaluate the effects of (a) incubation temperature, (b) organ type and (c) spatiotemporal variations on fungal isolation rate, fungal diversity and community composition. Our results showed a strong organ specificity and temporal dynamics among endophytic fungal communities, but the location of the forest stand had only a limited effect on fungal community composition. Low-temperature incubation enabled us to improve culture-based methods by discovering the diversity of cold-adapted fungal endophytes and a significantly different part of the endophytic communities that is usually missed by customary culturing temperature. The isolation of cold-adapted endophytes from a semiarid environment opens a new window to further studies on this kind of fungi in such ecosystems.",3733,"Doust, NH; Safaie, N; Schmitt, I; Otte, J; Bálint, M",NA,NA,NA,"Doust, Niloufar Hagh; Safaie, Naser; Schmitt, Imke; Otte, Juergen; Balint, Miklos",NA,Culture-based methods using low-temperature incubation revealed cold-adapted fungal endophytes from semiarid forests,FOREST PATHOLOGY,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hagh Doust, Niloufar/IZP-7786-2023; Safaie, Naser/E-1269-2018","Safaie, Naser/0000-0001-6065-7010; Hagh Doust, Niloufar/0000-0003-0616-5829",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1437-4781,1439-0329,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2019,49,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.1111/efp.12515,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/efp.12515,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000472576100005,NA,3578
11,Absence,"Plants harbour a heterogeneous population of endogenous microorganisms, comprising both pathogens and non-pathogens, including fungi, bacteria, actinomycetes, etc. Their association has substantial impact on plant health and fitness. Endophytes reside inside healthy plant tissues without producing any disease symptoms. They are helpful in modifying biochemicals produced by plants and may add to their protection from insect herbivores, fungal pathogens and even grazing by animals. However, the ecological role of these endophytes is not yet fully understood. This chapter reports on endophytic fungi present in beet and tomato leaves. Isolation and analysis of endophytic microorganisms of soybean and wheat are also described.

12,Absence,"There is increasing evidence that microbes play a key role in some plant invasions. A diverse and widespread but little understood group of plant-associated microbes are the fungal root endophytes of the order Sebacinales. They are associated with exotic populations of invasive knotweed (Reynoutria ssp.) in Europe, but their effects on the invaders are unknown. We used the recently isolated Sebacinales root endophyte Serendipita herbamans to experimentally inoculate invasive knotweed and study root colonisation and effects on knotweed growth under different environmental conditions. We verified the inoculation success and fungal colonisation through immunofluorescence microscopy and qPCR. We found that S. herbamans strongly colonized invasive knotweed in low-nutrient and shade environments, but much less under drought or benign conditions. At low nutrients, the endophyte had a positive effect on plant growth, whereas the opposite was true under shaded conditions. Our study demonstrates that the root endophyte S. herbamans has the potential to colonize invasive knotweed fine roots and impact its growth, and it could thus also play a role in natural populations. Our results also show that effects of fungal endophytes on plants can be strongly environment-dependent, and may only be visible under stressful environmental conditions.",8753,"Garnica, S; Liao, ZY; Hamard, S; Waller, F; Parepa, M; Bossdorf, O",NA,NA,NA,"Garnica, Sigisfredo; Liao, Zhiyong; Hamard, Samuel; Waller, Frank; Parepa, Madalin; Bossdorf, Oliver",NA,Environmental stress determines the colonization and impact of an endophytic fungus on invasive knotweed,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Parepa, Madalin/G-4352-2011; Garnica, Sigisfredo/P-6506-2014; Bossdorf, Oliver/A-8328-2008","Bossdorf, Oliver/0000-0001-7504-6511; Parepa, Madalin/0000-0002-3567-3884",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1387-3547,1573-1464,NA,NA,NA,JUN,2022,24,6,NA,NA,NA,1785,1795,NA,10.1007/s10530-022-02749-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-022-02749-y,NA,Feb-22,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000757750300002,NA,8418
13,Absence,"High-throughput sequencing technologies using amplicon approaches have changed the way that studies investigating fungal distribution are undertaken. These powerful and time-efficient technologies have the potential for the first time to accurately map fungal distributions across landscapes or changes in diversity across ecological or biological gradients of interest. There is no requirement for a fungus to form a fruiting body to be detected, and both culturable and nonculturable organisms can be detected. Here we use high-throughput amplicon sequencing from bulk DNA extracts to test the impact that biases associated with culture-based methods had on an earlier study that compared the influence of site and host on fungal diversity in Nothofagaceae forests in New Zealand. Both detection methods sampled tissue from the same set of symptomless, living leaves. We found that both the culturing and high-throughput approaches show that host is a stronger driver of fungal community structure than site, but that both methods have some taxonomic biases. We also found that the individual trees selected for high-throughput sampling can impact the alpha-diversity detected and through this could potentially affect subsequent analyses based on a comparison of this diversity. © 2017 The Mycological Society of America.",4289,Johnston P.R.; Park D.; Smissen R.D.,NA,,NA,"Johnston, Peter R.

14,Absence,"Simple Summary The richness (number of species) of the fungi kingdom is estimated at 1.5 million species, but the vast majority remains unknown. Many of them inhabit plants-the so-called fungal endophytes-and may establish different types of interactions with their host plant. Fungal endophytes have been traditionally studied by letting them grow in appropriate culturing media in petri dishes, but novel massive DNA sequencing techniques which do not require a cultivation step (metabarcoding) are gaining ground. Both techniques were applied and compared to characterize the mycobiome of plants of a tall grass (Brachypodium rupestre) growing in high-mountain grasslands with different plant diversity (low and high). The two methods showed similar trends comparing endophyte richness between plant tissue types (root > rhizome > shoot) and between grasslands (low-diversity > high-diversity). However, the metabarcoding identified almost six times more endophyte species than the culturing although the most isolated fungal species via culturing, Omnidemptus graminis, was not recognized via metabarcoding. We conclude that the complementation of both techniques is still the best option to obtain a complete characterization of the fungal endophytic assemblage of the plant species. Fungal endophytes develop inside plants without visible external signs, and they may confer adaptive advantages to their hosts. Culturing methods have been traditionally used to recognize the fungal endophytic assemblage, but novel metabarcoding techniques are being increasingly applied. This study aims to characterize the fungal endophytic assemblage in shoots, rhizomes and roots of the tall grass Brachypodium rupestre growing in a large area of natural grasslands with a continuum of anthropized disturbance regimes. Seven out of 88 taxa identified via metabarcoding accounted for 81.2% of the reads (Helotiaceae, Lachnum sp. A, Albotricha sp. A, Helotiales A, Agaricales A, Mycena sp. and Mollisiaceae C), revealing a small group of abundant endophytes and a large group of rare species. Although both methods detected the same trends in richness and fungal diversity among the tissues (root > rhizome > shoot) and grasslands (low-diversity > high-diversity grasslands), the metabarcoding tool identified 5.8 times more taxa than the traditional culturing method (15 taxa) but, surprisingly, failed to sequence the most isolated endophyte on plates, Omnidemptus graminis. Since both methods are still subject to important constraints, both are required to obtain a complete characterization of the fungal endophytic assemblage of the plant species.",6973,"Durán, M; San Emeterio, L; Canals, RM",NA,NA,NA,"Duran, Maria; San Emeterio, Leticia; Canals, Rosa Maria",NA,Comparison of Culturing and Metabarcoding Methods to Describe the Fungal Endophytic Assemblage of <i>Brachypodium rupestre</i> Growing in a Range of Anthropized Disturbance Regimes,BIOLOGY-BASEL,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Canals, Rosa Maria/L-2312-2014; San Emeterio, Leticia/H-4305-2014","Canals, Rosa Maria/0000-0002-5423-0106; San Emeterio, Leticia/0000-0002-8063-0402; Duran Lazaro, Maria/0000-0001-5842-631X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2079-7737,NA,NA,NA,DEC,2021,10,12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10.3390/biology10121246,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/biology10121246,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34943161,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000735982600001,NA,6693
