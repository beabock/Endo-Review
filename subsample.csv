"1","Every plant species examined to date harbors endophytic fungi within its asymptomatic aerial tissues, such that endophytes represent a ubiquitous, yet cryptic, component of terrestrial plant communities. Fungal endophytes associated with leaves of woody angiosperms are especially diverse; yet, fundamental aspects of their interactions with hosts are unknown. In contrast to the relatively species-poor endophytes that are vertically transmitted and act as defensive mutualists of some temperate grasses, the diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angiosperms are thought to contribute little to host defense. Here, we document high diversity, spatial structure, and host affinity among foliar endophytes associated with a tropical tree (Theobroma cacao, Malvaceae) across lowland Panama. We then show that inoculation of endophyte-free leaves with endophytes isolated frequently from naturally infected, asymptomatic hosts significantly decreases both leaf necrosis and leaf mortality when T. cacao seedlings are challenged with a major pathogen (Phytophthora sp.). In contrast to reports of fungal inoculation inducing systemic defense, we found that protection was primarily localized to endophyte-infected tissues. Further, endophyte-mediated protection was greater in mature leaves, which bear less intrinsic defense against fungal pathogens than do young leaves. In vitro studies suggest that host affinity is mediated by leaf chemistry, and that protection may be mediated by direct interactions of endophytes with foliar pathogens. Together, these data demonstrate the capacity of diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angiosperms to play an important but previously unappreciated role in host defense.","Arnold, AE; Mejía, LC; Kyllo, D; Rojas, EI; Maynard, Z; Robbins, N; Herre, EA",NA,NA,NA,"Arnold, AE; Mejía, LC; Kyllo, D; Rojas, EI; Maynard, Z; Robbins, N; Herre, EA",NA,"Fungal endophytes limit pathogen damage in a tropical tree","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mejia, Luis/KFR-7315-2024","Mejia, Luis/0000-0003-2135-5241",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0027-8424","1091-6490",NA,NA,NA,"DEC 23",2003,100,"26",NA,NA,NA,"15649","15654",NA,"10.1073/pnas.2533483100","http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2533483100",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,14671327,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000187554600066",NA,3287,"Both"
"2","The widespread aquatic plant Persicaria amphibia (water smartweed, Polygonaceae) occurs in both flooded aquatic habitats and moist terrestrial environments. Its physiological versatility and wide geographic range highlight its resilience to stress and make the species intriguing for the study of fungal endophytes. Endophytes occur within living plant tissues and are known from diverse aquatic, marine, and terrestrial plants, where they often mitigate plant responses to stress. As part of a study evaluating endophyte communities associated with aquatic plants in lentic waters of Arizona, USA, we isolated a distinctive clade of endophytes from healthy, living roots of seasonally inundated P. amphibia, which we describe here on the basis of morphology and evidence from four loci as new species Clohesyomyces symbioticus (Lindgomycetaceae, Pleosporales, Dothideomycetes, Ascomycota). Clohesyomyces has long been considered a monotypic genus comprising the saprobic species C. aquaticus, presently known from submerged wood in freshwater systems in Asia and Australia. Description of Clohesyomyces symbioticus highlights the occurrence of endophytism in this genus and expands its geographic scope to the western hemisphere. © 2021 W.

"3","Key requirements for microbes to initiate and establish mutualistic symbiotic interactions with plants are evasion of potential host defense responses and strict control of microbial growth. Reactive oxygen species ( ROS) produced by a specific NADPH oxidase isoform, NoxA, regulate hyphal growth in the mutualistic interaction between the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae and its grass host Lolium perenne. Unlike mammalian systems, little is known about the fungal NADPH oxidase complex and its response to differentiation signals. We identify an E. festucae p(67phox)- like regulator, NoxR, dispensable in culture but essential in planta for the symbiotic interaction. Plants infected with a noxR deletion mutant show severe stunting and premature senescence, whereas hyphae in the meristematic tissues show increased branching leading to increased fungal colonization of pseudostem and leaf blade tissue. Inhibition of ROS production or overexpression of noxR recapitulates the hyperbranching phenotype in culture. NoxR interacts in vitro with the small GTP binding protein RacA and requires a functional RacA binding site to complement the noxR mutant and restore the wild- type plant interaction phenotype. These results show that NoxR is a key regulator of NoxA in symbiosis, where it acts together with RacA to spatially regulate ROS production and control hyphal branching and patterning.","Takemoto, D; Tanaka, A; Scott, B",NA,NA,NA,"Takemoto, Daigo; Tanaka, Aiko; Scott, Barry",NA,"A p67<SUP>Phox</SUP>-like regulator is recruited to control hyphal branching in a fungal-grass mutualistic symbiosis","PLANT CELL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tanaka, Aiko/ABG-8351-2020; Scott, David/J-3135-2013","Takemoto, Daigo/0000-0002-9816-7882",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1040-4651",NA,NA,NA,NA,"OCT",2006,18,"10",NA,NA,NA,"2807","2821",NA,"10.1105/tpc.106.046169","http://dx.doi.org/10.1105/tpc.106.046169",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,17041146,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000241818300029",NA,4781,"Absence"
"4","Beneficial plant-associated microorganisms, such as fungal endophytes, are key partners that normally improve plant survival under different environmental stresses. It has been shown that microorganisms from extreme environments, like those associated with the roots of Antarctica plants, can be good partners to increase the performance of crop plants and to restore endangered native plants. Nothofagus alessandrii and N. glauca, are among the most endangered species of Chile, restricted to a narrow and/or limited distributional range associated mainly to the Maulino forest in Chile. Here we evaluated the effect of the inoculation with a fungal consortium of root endophytes isolated from the Antarctic host plant Colobanthus quitensis on the ecophysiological performance [photosynthesis, water use efficiency (WUE), and growth] of both endangered tree species. We also, tested how Antarctic root-fungal endophytes could affect the potential distribution of N. alessandrii through niche modeling. Additionally, we conducted a transplant experiment recording plant survival on 2 years in order to validate the model. Lastly, to evaluate if inoculation with Antarctic endophytes has negative impacts on native soil microorganisms, we compared the biodiversity of fungi and bacterial in the rhizospheric soil of transplanted individuals of N. alessandrii inoculated and non-inoculated with fungal endophytes. We found that inoculation with root-endophytes produced significant increases in N. alessandrii and N. glauca photosynthetic rates, water use efficiencies and cumulative growth. In N. alessandrii, seedling survival was significantly greater on inoculated plants compared with non-inoculated individuals. For this species, a spatial distribution modeling revealed that, inoculation with root-fungal endophytes could potentially increase the current distributional range by almost threefold. Inoculation with root-fungal endophytes, did not reduce native rhizospheric microbiome diversity. Our results suggest that the studied consortium of Antarctic root-fungal endophytes improve the ecophysiological performance as well as the survival of inoculated trees and can be used as a biotechnological tool for the restoration of endangered tree species.","Torres-Díaz, C; Valladares, MA; Acuña-Rodríguez, IS; Ballesteros, GI; Barrera, A; Atala, C; Molina-Montenegro, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Torres-Diaz, Cristian; Valladares, Moises A.; Acuna-Rodriguez, Ian S.; Ballesteros, Gabriel I.; Barrera, Andrea; Atala, Cristian; Molina-Montenegro, Marco A.",NA,"Symbiotic Interaction Enhances the Recovery of Endangered Tree Species in the Fragmented Maulino Forest","FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ballesteros, Gabriel/IAN-7082-2023; Valladares, Moisés/Q-5088-2019; Valladares, Moises A./N-1152-2017","Torres Diaz, Cristian/0000-0002-5741-5288; Valladares, Moises A./0000-0002-0294-174X; Atala, Cristian/0000-0003-1337-9534",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-462X",NA,NA,NA,NA,"APR 15",2021,12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3389/fpls.2021.663017","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.663017",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33936153,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000645024100001",NA,1425,"Both"

"6","The fabaceae are rooted in rosaceae pods known as ""vegetables"" by the early botanists. They are the third family of angiosperms which includes 642 genus divided into about 18,000 species. The fabaceae family is known as the most important family of the ecosystem as it is indispensable in medicine, agriculture, industry and livestock. The Adenocarpus genus has about 50 species that are frequently found in tropical regions of Northern Africa, the southern part of West Europe and in the central and southern Italy. They are used in traditional medicine for the treatment of several diseases: such as microbial infections, leprosy, scabies, acne, malaria and other plants species are used in agriculture as insecticidal properties. Mainly Adenocarpus mannii species is well represented in the tropical regions of North Africa. It occurs in Angola, Mozambique, Malawi, Guinea, South Africa, Tanzania, and Burundi. In Cameroon, it is encountered in South West Region and West Region. Previous phytochemical studies led to the isolation of several classes of compounds such as flavonoids, alkaloids and triterpenes. Several studies report the phytochemical studies on genus Adenocarpus and chemotaxonomic markers of species of this genus.

"7","Wilting of sweet pepper plants is leading to significant yield losses in organic cultivation in glasshouses in the Netherlands. Verticillium dahliae was consistently isolated from affected plants and is known to cause wilting of plants. While sampling sweet pepper plants, root discoloration and damage of the root cortex were observed. Colletotrichum coccodes was isolated from affected roots. To study the co-occurrence and interaction of both pathogens, sweet pepper plants with, and without wilting symptoms were collected from the glasshouse. V. dahliae was only isolated from plants with wilting symptoms, while C. coccodes was also found on symptomless plants. Single or combined inoculations with V. dahliae and C. coccodes were performed on pepper seedlings to study the pathogenicity and the interaction of both pathogens. Symptom development was evaluated and fungal colonization was measured in the roots and stem with real-time PCR. V. dahliae induced stunted growth, while C. coccodes did not induce symptoms on the shoot. C. coccodes reduced root weight when plants grew under suboptimal conditions but under optimal conditions for plant growth, C. coccodes reduced V. dahliae colonization and symptom development. In conclusion, V. dahliae is the causal agent of wilting of pepper plants and C. coccodes is a weak pathogen, with antagonistic or neutral effects on symptom development and colonization by V. dahliae. This work can contribute to the understanding of soilborne diseases and their interaction with each other.","Tyvaert, L; Everaert, E; Lippens, L; Cuijpers, WJM; França, SC; Höfte, M",NA,NA,NA,"Tyvaert, L.; Everaert, E.; Lippens, L.; Cuijpers, W.

"8","Lycoris radiata is the main source of galanthamine, a clinical drug used in Alzheimer's disease; however, the galanthamine content in L. radiata is low. Lycoris aurea is another Lycoris species with high galanthamine content. Fungal endophytes can enhance plant secondary metabolite accumulation; thus, we compared the fungal communities in these two Lycoris species to identify certain fungal taxa in L. aurea capable of enhancing galanthamine accumulation. Several fungal endophytes, which were enriched in, exclusively isolated from L. aurea, or showed significant correlations with galanthamine, were demonstrated to enhance the accumulation of only galanthamine but no other Amaryllidaceae alkaloids (AAs) in L. radiata. These fungal endophytes mainly upregulated the downstream genes in the biosynthesis pathways of AAs in L. radiata, suggesting that they may allocate more precursors for galanthamine biosynthesis. This study demonstrated that fungal endophytes from L. aurea with higher galanthamine content can specifically enhance the accumulation of this medicinal alkaloid in other Lycoris species, thereby increasing the galanthamine source and reducing galanthamine separation and purification costs. This study broadens our understanding of the complex interactions between plant secondary metabolites and fungal endophytes.","Wang, ZY; Yuan, J; Wang, R; Xu, S; Zhou, JY",NA,NA,NA,"Wang, Ziying; Yuan, Jie; Wang, Ren; Xu, Sheng; Zhou, Jiayu",NA,"Distinct fungal communities affecting opposite galanthamine accumulation patterns in two<i> Lycoris</i> species","MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0944-5013","1618-0623",NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2024,286,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.micres.2024.127791","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.micres.2024.127791",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38851007,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001347801500001",NA,4913,"Both"

Significant intraspecific variation was observed in biomass production on all substrates. While pooled data for all genotypes of each taxon revealed significant interspecific differences in biomass production on carboxymethylcellulose, glucose, cellobiose, and starch, mean biomass production for each taxon on the latter three substrates differed less than threefold, suggesting that the saprotrophic abilities of the two taxa are broadly similar.","Midgley, DJ; Chambers, SM; Cairney, JWG",NA,NA,NA,"Midgley, DJ; Chambers, SM; Cairney, JWG",NA,"Utilisation of carbon substrates by multiple genotypes of ericoid mycorrhizal fungal endophytes from eastern Australian Ericaceae","MYCORRHIZA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Midgley, David/GOV-4218-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0940-6360","1432-1890",NA,NA,NA,"AUG",2004,14,"4",NA,NA,NA,"245","251",NA,"10.1007/s00572-003-0262-5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-003-0262-5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12938028,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000223295500005",NA,7258,"Absence"
"10","Endophytes play an important role in ecological and evolutionary processes in plants and have marked economic value. Seed-transmitted fungal endophytes are conventionally regarded as mutualistic symbionts, but their fitness consequences for the offspring of the host are not clear. Puccinellia distans infected with the fungus Epichloe typhina (E+) produces seeds that are several times smaller than normal (E). This observation suggests that the E+ seedlings face a developmental disadvantage. Our growth chamber experiments compared the germination rates of the small E+ and large E seeds of P.distans and examined the biomass allocation of seedlings to roots and shoots. The E+ seedlings germinated more slowly and maintained shorter shoots and a smaller root biomass for 3050days after sowing. Despite this disadvantage, the E+ plants more quickly increased their total size, attaining a larger shoot and whole-plant biomass. The shoot:root biomass ratio increased more rapidly through time in the E+ seedlings, attaining a value nine times higher in the E+ than the E group 50days after sowing. Such differences between the E+ and E seedlings were not explained by the growth allometry between shoots and roots. The seedlings of P.distans infected with the Epichloe endophyte were initially handicapped by their postponed emergence, but this disadvantage was quickly overcome by their superior growth capacity. The decrease in the relative allocation to roots may indicate that endophytes increase the performance of roots as resource-acquiring organs and/or reduce the role of roots in protection against herbivores.","Czarnoleski, M; Olejniczak, P; Górzynska, K; Kozlowski, J; Lembicz, M",NA,NA,NA,"Czarnoleski, M.; Olejniczak, P.; Gorzynska, K.; Kozlowski, J.; Lembicz, M.",NA,"Altered allocation to roots and shoots in the endophyte-infected seedlings of Puccinellia distans (Poaceae)","PLANT BIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Górzyńska, Karolina/ABE-7506-2020; Kozlowski, Jan/K-5549-2012; Czarnoleski, Marcin/H-2893-2015","Czarnoleski, Marcin/0000-0003-2645-0360; Lembicz, Marlena/0000-0003-1714-4716; Gorzynska, Karolina/0000-0002-4226-1706; Olejniczak, Pawel/0000-0002-6269-6811; Kozlowski, Jan/0000-0002-7084-2030",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1435-8603","1438-8677",NA,NA,NA,"MAR",2013,15,"2",NA,NA,NA,"264","273",NA,"10.1111/j.1438-8677.2012.00633.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1438-8677.2012.00633.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,22726626,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000314756900002",NA,2483,"Both"
"11","Asexual systemic fungi that live symbiotically within grasses are viewed as strong mutualists on the basis of theory and empirical studies of introduced agronomic grasses. Evolutionary theory predicts that microbial symbionts that lose sexuality and rely on propagules of their hosts for transmission should evolve to benefit their hosts. Fungal endophytes of some cultivated turf and pasture grasses are well known for increasing plant performance and competitive abilities, especially under stress, and increasing resistance to herbivores, pathogens, and root-feeders by virtue of fungal alkaloids. The assumption of mutualism, however, has rarely been tested in native grasses, which often harbor high but variable frequencies of systemic asexual endophytes. We tested the effect of Neotyphodium infections for the native grass Arizona fescue in a 3-yr field experiment. We strictly controlled host genotype and manipulated soil moisture and nutrients. Infection generally decreased host growth in terms of plant volume, number of tillers, and dry mass of shoots and roots. Infected plants also showed decreased reproduction in terms of number and mass of seeds, and the seeds produced by infected plants had lower germination success than plants without their endophytes, suggesting that the negative effects of the symbiont are transferred to the next generation. Plant genotype strongly influenced host's growth and reproduction and interacted with the presence of the endophyte, but the interaction was usually in the direction of negative effects. Our results challenge the notion that systemic asexual endophytes must be plant mutualists for infections to persist in nature. We propose other hypotheses to explain the variable but usually high endophyte frequencies in natural populations of grasses.","Faeth, SH; Sullivan, TJ",NA,NA,NA,"Faeth, SH; Sullivan, TJ",NA,"Mutualistic asexual endophytes in a native grass are usually parasitic","AMERICAN NATURALIST",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0003-0147","1537-5323",NA,NA,NA,"FEB",2003,161,"2",NA,NA,NA,"310","325",NA,"10.1086/345937","http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/345937",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12675375,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000181152300010",NA,989,"Absence"
"12","Bacterial and fungal endophytes may help their host in terms of improved tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses and enhanced growth. European apple canker, caused by Neonectria ditissima, is widespread in apple-growing regions. Infection by N. ditissima occurs through artificial or natural wounds, including leaf scars, picking wounds, and pruning cuts. Using F-1 progeny trees in an experimental orchard derived from a cross between a canker-susceptible genotype and a canker-tolerant or -resistant genotype, we assessed both bacterial and fungal endophyte communities in apple leaf scars, and determined correlations of endophytes with canker development. All trees were artificially inoculated with an N. ditissima isolate postplanting. Specific components of apple endophytes as well as a number of individual fungal or bacterial groups in leaf scars were partially genetically controlled by host genotypes. Several bacterial groups were significantly correlated with canker-related traits, mostly positively associated with canker tolerance. A few fungal groups may facilitate canker development whereas others may compete with canker. However, most of these microbial groups could not be identified to the species level with confidence; even for those groups which could be assigned to the species level, there is insufficient knowledge about their ecological characteristics in relation to plants.

"13","Understanding the dynamics of a hereditary symbiosis requires testing how ecological factors alter not only the fitness consequences of the symbiosis, but also the rate of symbiont transmission to the next generation. The relative importance of these two mechanisms remains unresolved because studies have not simultaneously examined how the ecological context of the symbiosis influences both costs/benefits and the rate of vertical transmission. Fungal endophytes in grasses have provided particularly tractable systems for investigating the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of hereditary symbiosis. Here we examine interactions between a fungal endophyte. Epichloe amarillans, and its grass host, Agrostis hyemalis, under altered abiotic and biotic contexts: a gradient of water availability and in the presence versus absence of soil microbes. We show that benefits of the symbiosis were strongest when water was limiting. Symbiotic plants at the lowest watering level produced similar to 40% more inflorescences and greater seed mass than non-symbiotic plants, while at the highest watering level, symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants did not significantly differ in reproductive fitness. Benefits appear to accrue by allowing hosts to escape from drought, a response that has not been previously reported to be endophyte-mediated. Symbiotic plants at the lowest watering level flowered 9 days earlier than non-symbiotic plants. Interestingly, our results suggest the symbiosis may be costly in the presence of soil microbes, as on live soil, the biomass of symbiotic plants was lower than the biomass of symbiont-free plants. We detected no effect of either the biotic or abiotic context on the rate of symbiont vertical transmission, suggesting that the context-dependent benefits of the symbiosis are the more important driver of variation in symbiont frequency in this system.

"14","In 2006, a controlled infection study was performed in the 'Kranzberger Forst' to address the following questions: (1) Will massive artificial inoculation with Apiognomonia errabunda override the previously observed inhibitory effect of chronic ozone? (2) Can biochemical or molecular markers be detected to account for the action of ozone? To this end six adult beech trees were chosen, three ozone fumigated (2 x ozone) and three control trees (ambient = 1 x ozone). Spore-sprayed branches of sun and shade crown positions of each of the trees, and uninoculated control branches, were enclosed in 1004 plastic bags for one night to facilitate infection initiation. Samples were taken within a five-week period after inoculation. A. errabunda infestation levels quantified by real-time PCR increased in leaves that were not fumigated with additional ozone.

"16","Grasses infected with fungal endophytes are known to deter herbivores. Although ingestion of infected plant tissues has detrimental effects on insects, birds, domestic livestock, and laboratory rodents, little is known about the consequences of endophyte consumption for wild rodent consumers. This multigenerational study investigated how consumption of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) seeds infected with the endophytic fungus Acremonium coenophialum affects prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster). Breeding pairs were fed one of three base diets: laboratory rodent chow (C; control diet), 50% uninfected tall fescue seeds plus 50% chow (E-), or 50% endophyte-infected seeds plus 50% chow (E+). In the first generation, the E+ diet suppressed food and water intake, growth rates, and reproductive success, so no voles fed on the E+ diet could be followed in the second generation. In general, voles of the two generations performed similarly on the C and E- diets. Our findings show that prairie voles are sensitive to the presence of endophytes, or associated alkaloids, in their diets, and suggest that free-ranging voles avoid consuming endophyte-infected plant tissues if other foods are available.","Durham, WF; Tannenbaum, MG",NA,"",NA,"Durham, WF; Tannenbaum, MG",NA,"Effects of endophyte consumption on food intake, growth, and reproduction in prairie voles","CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE",NA,NA,"English","Article",NA,"","","",NA,"","Acremonium coenophialum; Festuca arundinacea; Microtus ochrogaster; endophyte; food intake; growth response; herbivory; reproduction; rodent","Durham W.F., Division of Science, Truman State University, Kirksville, MO 63501, United States; Tannenbaum M.G., Division of Science, Truman State University, Kirksville, MO 63501, United States","Division of Science, Truman State University, Kirksville, MO 63501, United States","M.G.

"18","This research was conducted to determine the nature and incidence of fungal root endophytes on fourwing saltbush, Atriplex canescens (Pursh) Nutt. Root colter cells of fourwing saltbush in arid rangelands of the southwestern United States were analyzed and found to be regularly colonized with three types of endophytic fungi: septate, vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM), and Chytridiomycetes. Septate fungi were 2.7 times more prevalent than VAM and formed intimate non-pathogenic associations characterized by inter- and intracellular hyphae, coils, microsclerotia, and occasional labyrinthine or ''Hartig net'' structures similar to those affiliated with ectendomycorrhizae. External hyphae formed intimate associations with soil and sand particles. Typically, VAM were characterized by hyphae, vesicles, and (at times) coils. VAM were 2.2 times more prevalent than chytrids. Chytrids were rather common and were expressed as resting and active sporangia found within root cortex cells. The widespread occurrence of these non-destructive fungal associations with plants implies that they have an important role in plant survival in arid environments.","Barrow, JR; Havstad, KM; McCaslin, BD",NA,NA,NA,"Barrow, JR; Havstad, KM; McCaslin, BD",NA,"Fungal root endophytes in fourwing saltbush, Atriplex canescens, on arid rangelands of southwestern USA","ARID SOIL RESEARCH AND REHABILITATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0890-3069",NA,NA,NA,NA,"APR-JUN",1997,11,"2",NA,NA,NA,"177","185",NA,"10.1080/15324989709381470","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15324989709381470",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1997XD31700006",NA,8595,"Absence"
"19","Dollar spot disease, caused by the fungal pathogen Clarireedia jacksonii, is a major problem in many turfgrass species, particularly creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera). It is well-established that strong creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra subsp. rubra) exhibits good dollar spot resistance when infected by the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae. This endophyte-mediated disease resistance is unique to the fine fescues and has not been observed in other grass species infected with other Epichloe spp. The mechanism underlying the unique endophyte-mediated disease resistance in strong creeping red fescue has not yet been established. We pursued the possibility that it may be due to the presence of an abundant secreted antifungal protein produced by E. festucae. Here, we compare the activity of the antifungal protein expressed in Escherichia coli, Pichia pastoris, and Penicillium chrysogenum. Active protein was recovered from all systems, with the best activity being from Pe. chrysogenum. In greenhouse assays, topical application of the purified antifungal protein to creeping bentgrass and endophyte-free strong creeping red fescue protected the plants from developing severe symptoms caused by C. jacksonii. These results support the hypothesis that Efe-AfpA is a major contributor to the dollar spot resistance observed with E. festucae-infected strong creeping red fescue in the field, and that this protein could be developed as an alternative or complement to fungicides for the management of this disease on turfgrasses.","Fardella, PA; Tian, ZP; Clarke, BB; Belanger, FC",NA,NA,NA,"Fardella, Patrick A.; Tian, Zipeng; Clarke, Bruce B.; Belanger, Faith C.",NA,"The <i>Epichloe festucae</i> Antifungal Protein <i>Efe</i>-AfpA Protects Creeping Bentgrass (<i>Agrostis stolonifera</i>) from the Plant Pathogen <i>Clarireedia jacksonii</i>, the Causal Agent of Dollar Spot Disease","JOURNAL OF FUNGI",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Belanger, Faith/0000-0002-8725-0824",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2309-608X",NA,NA,NA,"OCT",2022,8,"10",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/jof8101097","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof8101097",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36294663,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000873026400001",NA,2143,"Both"
"20","Plants are colonized various microorganisms including endophytes. These microbes can play an important role in agricultural production as they promote plant growth and/or enhance the resistance of their host plant against diseases and environmental stress conditions. Although culture-independent molecular approaches such as DNA barcoding have greatly enhanced our understanding of bacterial and fungal endophyte communities, there are some methodical problems when investigating endophyte diversity. One main issue are sequence contaminations such as plastid-derived rRNA gene sequences which are co-amplified due to their high homology to bacterial 16S rRNA genes. The same is true for plant and fungal ITS sequences. The application of highly specific-primers suppressing co-amplification of these sequence contaminations is a good solution for this issue. Here, we describe a detailed protocol for assessing bacterial and fungal endophyte diversity in plants using these primers in combination with next-generation sequencing.","Wemheuer, B; Wemheuer, F",NA,"Streit, WR; Daniel, R",NA,"Wemheuer, Bernd; Wemheuer, Franziska",NA,"Assessing Bacterial and Fungal Diversity in the Plant Endosphere","METAGENOMICS: METHODS AND PROTOCOLS, 2ND EDITION","Methods in Molecular Biology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1064-3745","1940-6029","978-1-4939-6691-2; 978-1-4939-6689-9",NA,NA,NA,2017,1539,NA,NA,NA,NA,"75","84",NA,"10.1007/978-1-4939-6691-2_6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-6691-2_6","10.1007/978-1-4939-6691-2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27900685,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000412190900007",NA,6167,"Absence"
"21","This chapter answers the questions what, how, where, when, and who of measuring Neotyphodium oenophialum (Morgan-Jones and Gams) Glenn, Bacon, and Hanlin endophyte in tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceaum (Schreb.) Darbysh.]. Analysis is a technical procedure that usually is performed on samples collected from the field and sent to a laboratory. The most common description of endophyte infection is the proportion of tillers in a field that have endophyte present. The availability of new detection options allows measurement with relatively simple laboratory equipment. The commercial availability of nontoxic novel endophytes in tall fescue is making the detection of endophytes and determination of their toxic potential complex. This is due to the need for the analysis to distinguish those plants with endophytes that are producing toxic alkaloids from those plants with endophytes that are producing nontoxic alkaloids. Guidelines for sampling endophyte in tall fescue pasture are presented. © 2009 by American Society of Agronomy, Inc. Crop Science Society of America, Inc.

"22","The root fungal endophyte Piriformospora indica promotes the growth and survival of plants belonging to a number of species when exposed to various abiotic stresses, including drought, a major constraint of crop productivity. The application of 'omics technologies has revealed much of the molecular basis of the plant drought stress response. Here, the proteomic and metabolomic response of the leaves of moisture-stressed barley plants inoculated with P. indica was characterized. The abundance of 145 proteins was altered by the imposition of moderate drought on plants inoculated by P. indica, as was that of 104 in non-inoculated plants, while an episode of more severe stress altered the content of, respectively, 144 and 462 proteins. Many of these responsive proteins were involved in the plant's primary metabolism, in particular acting to mitigate the damage caused by oxidative stress. Colonization of the roots by P. indica enhanced the activity of both the photosystem and the electron transfer chain, and also promoted the accumulation of proteins protective of photorespiration, energy modulation, primary metabolism, transporters and autophagy. The beneficial effect of P. indica colonization on autophagy in plants exposed to stress may relate to alterations in the host's amino acid metabolism.","Ghaffari, MR; Mirzaei, M; Ghabooli, M; Khatabi, B; Wu, YQ; Zabet-Moghaddam, M; Moharnmadi-Nejad, G; Haynes, PA; Hajirezaei, MR; Sepehri, M; Salekdeh, GH",NA,NA,NA,"Ghaffari, Mohammad Reza; Mirzaei, Mehdi; Ghabooli, Mehdi; Khatabi, Behnam; Wu, Yunqi; Zabet-Moghaddam, Masoud; Moharnmadi-Nejad, Ghasem; Haynes, Paul A.; Hajirezaei, Mohammad Reza; Sepehri, Mozhgan; Salekdeh, Ghasem Hosseini",NA,"Root endophytic fungus <i>Piriformospora indica</i> improves drought stress adaptation in barley by metabolic and proteomic reprogramming","ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mirzaei, Mohammad/S-3198-2017; Ghabooli, Mehdi/K-3365-2019; Salekdeh, Ghasem/E-4198-2012; ghaffari, mohammad/B-7840-2019; Ghaffari, Mohammad Reza/KII-4990-2024","Mohammadi-Nejad, Ghasem/0000-0002-5767-9734; mirzaei, mahdi/0000-0001-9817-9157; Haynes, Paul/0000-0003-1472-8249; Ghaffari, Mohammad Reza/0000-0002-7139-8613; Salekdeh, Ghasem Hosseini/0000-0002-5124-4721; Sepehri, Mozhgan/0000-0003-1190-9407; Ghabooli, Mehdi/0000-0002-6173-7327; Mirzaei, Mehdi/0000-0001-8727-4984",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0098-8472","1873-7307",NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2019,157,NA,NA,NA,NA,"197","210",NA,"10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.10.002","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2018.10.002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000454465500020",NA,8300,"Absence"

"24","Evidence is presented that ergot alkaloids are ubiquitous in tall fescue pastures infected with the clavicipitaceous fungal endophyte Sphacelia typhina (or Acremonium coenophialum). Ergopeptide alkaloids, predominantly ergovaline, constituted 10 to 50 percent of the total ergot alkaloid concentration, which was as high as 14 milligrams per kilogram in sheaths and 1.5 milligrams per kilogram in blades. Ergot alkaloid concentrations were substantially increased by application of large amounts (10 millimoles per liter) of potassium nitrate or ammonium chloride to infected plants in the greenhouse. The results indicate that ergot alkaloids are probably responsible for the toxicity to cattle of this common pasture and lawn grass and that ergotism-like toxicoses may be caused by clavicipitaceous fungi other than Claviceps.","LYONS, PC; PLATTNER, RD; BACON, CW",NA,NA,NA,"LYONS, PC; PLATTNER, RD; BACON, CW",NA,"OCCURRENCE OF PEPTIDE AND CLAVINE ERGOT ALKALOIDS IN TALL FESCUE GRASS","SCIENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0036-8075","1095-9203",NA,NA,NA,"APR 25",1986,232,"4749",NA,NA,NA,"487","489",NA,"10.1126/science.3008328","http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.3008328",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3008328,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1986A932700025",NA,3289,"Both"
"25","The incidence of epichloid endophytes in populations of wild grasses is usually variable, and the knowledge about distribution patterns and how environmental factors affect such an incidence is limited. Here we performed a broad scale survey data to study whether the distribution patterns and the incidence of vertically-transmitted endophytes in populations of two native grasses from South-America, Poa lanuginosa Poir. and Poa bonariensis (Lam.) Kunth., are associated with environmental characteristics. We also characterized the endophytes from different populations to establish if the genotype of the endophytes is also correlated with environmental variables. The incidence of endophytes ranged from 0 to 100 % in both host species. In P. lanuginosa, endophytes were only found in populations on sandy coastal dunes and their incidence was positively associated with winter regime rainfall and soil water availability in the growing season. In P. bonariensis, endophytes were only found in populations in xerophytic forests and their incidence was highly associated with plant community. The distributions of infested populations suggested that the endophytes are not found in those areas with the most favorable or most stressing growth conditions accordingly to climatic or edaphical characteristics. Only the vertically transmitted hybrid endophyte species Neotyphodium tembladerae was detected in both host species. Under the hypothesis of vertical transmission, these results suggested that the endophyte should have been lost in endophyte free populations but is maintained in populations established in environments presenting moderate stress as salinity or short drought periods.","Iannone, LJ; Mc Cargo, PD; Giussani, LM; Schardl, CL",NA,NA,NA,"Iannone, Leopoldo J.; Mc Cargo, Patricia D.; Giussani, Liliana M.; Schardl, Christopher L.",NA,"Geographic distribution patterns of vertically transmitted endophytes in two native grasses in Argentina","SYMBIOSIS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Giussani, Liliana/GQQ-1964-2022; Schardl, Christopher/P-5655-2014","Giussani, Liliana Monica/0000-0002-4883-4034; Schardl, Christopher/0000-0003-2197-0842",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0334-5114","1878-7665",NA,NA,NA,"FEB",2013,59,"2",NA,NA,NA,"99","110",NA,"10.1007/s13199-012-0214-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-012-0214-y",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000316971300004",NA,7877,"Both"
"26","Polyploidy and symbiotic Epichloe fungal endophytes are common and heritable characteristics that can facilitate environmental range expansion in grasses. Here we examined geographic patterns of polyploidy and the frequency of fungal endophyte colonized plants in 29 Festuca rubra L. populations from eight geographic sites across latitudes from Spain to northernmost Finland and Greenland. Ploidy seemed to be positively and negatively correlated with latitude and productivity, respectively. However, the correlations were nonlinear; 84% of the plants were hexaploids (2n = 6x = 42), and the positive correlation between ploidy level and latitude is the result of only four populations skewing the data. In the southern-most end of the gradient 86% of the plants were tetraploids (2n = 4x = 28), whereas in the northernmost end of the gradient one population had only octoploid plants (2n = 8x = 56). Endophytes were detected in 22 out of the 29 populations. Endophyte frequencies varied among geographic sites, and populations and habitats within geographic sites irrespective of ploidy, latitude or productivity. The highest overall endophyte frequencies were found in the southernmost end of the gradient, Spain, where 69% of plants harbored endophytes. In northern Finland, endophytes were detected in 30% of grasses but endophyte frequencies varied among populations from 0% to 75%, being higher in meadows compared to riverbanks. The endophytes were detected in 36%, 30% and 27% of the plants in Faroe Islands, Iceland and Switzerland, respectively. Practically all examined plants collected from southern Finland and Greenland were endophyte-free, whereas in other geographic sites endophyte frequencies were highly variable among populations. Common to all populations with high endophyte frequencies is heavy vertebrate grazing. We propose that the detected endophyte frequencies and ploidy levels mirror past distribution history of F. rubra after the last glaciation period, and local adaptations to past or prevailing selection forces such as vertebrate grazing.","Dirihan, S; Helander, M; Väre, H; Gundel, PE; Garibaldi, LA; Irisarri, JGN; Saloniemi, I; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Dirihan, Serdar; Helander, Marjo; Vare, Henry; Gundel, Pedro E.; Garibaldi, Lucas A.; Irisarri, J.

"27","Because of the increased interest in endophyte-infected grasses, an effcient detection method was deemed necessary. To facilitate screening a large number of indiviudal seeds and plants, a rapid, safe staining procedure was developed using rose bengal. Previous methods were time-consuming and often required careful boiling of the plant tissues. The rose bengal staining procedure is simple and effective and gave excellent visual result. Minimal staining times of 30-60 ec gave good fungal differentiation even in thick tissues, and no additional fixing was necessary. Seeds and dried tissue also were stained effectively.","SAHA, DC; JACKSON, MA; JOHNSONCICALESE, JM",NA,NA,NA,"SAHA, DC; JACKSON, MA; JOHNSONCICALESE, JM",NA,"A RAPID STAINING METHOD FOR DETECTION OF ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI IN TURF AND FORAGE GRASSES","PHYTOPATHOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0031-949X","1943-7684",NA,NA,NA,"FEB",1988,78,"2",NA,NA,NA,"237","239",NA,"10.1094/Phyto-78-237","http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/Phyto-78-237",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1988M438200023",NA,1413,"Absence"
"28","Phytobiomes consist of plants, their environment, and their associated communities of macro and microorganisms. Within the phytobiome, the microbiome consists of the microorganisms associated with the plants comprising the endophytes and epiphytes. Endophytes are microorganisms, mainly consisting of bacteria and fungi, which colonise internal plant tissues without causing any disease symptom or tissue damage in different hosts. All these organisms associated to the plant contribute to its fitness. In this article, we revised a total of 103 studies containing the terms phytobiomes and microbiomes and endophytes, with the aims of reviewing: (i) the evolution of the term endophyte and the evolution of the endophyte condition; (ii) the current literature on studies considering the endophyte community within phytobiomes; and (iii) the literature on the bacteria living in fungal endophytes. In our analyses, we highlighted the biases that have been introduced in the phytobiomes' studies. For example, the presence of endohyphal bacteria could have contributed to overestimating the number of bacterial endophytes in the scientific literature.

Bare ground, turfgrass cover, and weed cover varied over time with grass species. Stands of tall fescue generally had more bare ground, greater weed cover, and less grass cover than stands of perennial ryegrass during the first year following seeding. However, this trend was reversed over time with stands of perennial ryegrass having more bare ground, more weed cover, and less turfgrass cover compared to stands of tall fescue after four years. The influence of endophyte infection was much weaker than predicted having a significant negative influence only on cover by one weed species, Cerastium vulgatum. Results indicated that grass species and fungal endophyte infection may influence patterns of weed occurrence in low maintenance lawns, although the influence of grass species is likely far more important in this regard.

We predicted that the presence of the mutualistic fungal endophyte Epichloe gansuensis in Achnatherum inebrians would change both the composition of leaf cuticular wax as plants aged during the growing season and the gene expression levels associated with the wax biosynthesis pathway. Endophyte-infected (EI) and endophyte-free (EF) A. inebrians plants were established for a four-month pot experiment. In agreement with our prediction, the presence of E. gansuensis can change the composition of leaf cuticular wax at different growing periods, particularly the proportion of esters, fatty acids and hydrocarbons. The proportion of fatty acids in EI plants was lower than that in EF plants. The proportion of hydrocarbons increased and esters decreased as plants grew.

"34","Serendipitaceae represents a diverse fungal group in the Basidiomycota that includes endophytes and lineages that repeatedly evolved ericoid, orchid and ectomycorrhizal lifestyle. Plants rely upon both nitrogen and phosphorous, for essential growth processes, and are often provided by mycorrhizal fungi. In this study, we investigated the cellular proteome of Serendipita vermifera MAFF305830 and closely related Serendipita vermifera subsp. bescii NFPB0129 grown in vitro under (N) ammonium and (P) phosphate starvation conditions. Mycelial growth pattern was documented under these conditions to correlate growth-specific responses to nutrient starvation. We found that N-starvation accelerated hyphal radial growth, whereas P-starvation accelerated hyphal branching. Additionally, P-starvation triggers an integrated starvation response leading to remodelling of lipid metabolism. Higher abundance of an ammonium transporter known to serve as both an ammonium sensor and stimulator of hyphal growth was detected under N-starvation. Additionally, N-starvation led to strong up-regulation of nitrate, amino acid, peptide, and urea transporters, along with several proteins predicted to have peptidase activity. Taken together, our finding suggests S. bescii and S. vermifera have the metabolic capacity for nitrogen assimilation from organic forms of N compounds. We hypothesize that the nitrogen metabolite repression is a key regulator of such organic N assimilation.","Ray, P; Abraham, PE; Guo, YQ; Giannone, RJ; Engle, NL; Yang, ZK; Jacobson, D; Hettich, RL; Tschaplinski, TJ; Craven, KD",NA,NA,NA,"Ray, Prasun; Abraham, Paul E.; Guo, Yingqing; Giannone, Richard J.; Engle, Nancy L.; Yang, Zamin K.; Jacobson, Daniel; Hettich, Robert L.; Tschaplinski, Timothy J.; Craven, Kelly D.",NA,"Scavenging organic nitrogen and remodelling lipid metabolism are key survival strategies adopted by the endophytic fungi, <i>Serendipita vermifera</i> and <i>Serendipita bescii</i> to alleviate nitrogen and phosphorous starvation in vitro","ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY REPORTS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hettich, Robert/N-1458-2016; Giannone, Richard/ABC-8247-2020; Abraham, Paul/K-5599-2015; Tschaplinski, Timothy/D-6382-2018; Engle, Nancy L/D-6494-2018","Craven, Kelly/0000-0002-1597-9413; Giannone, Richard/0000-0001-8551-0138; Engle, Nancy L/0000-0003-0290-7987",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1758-2229",NA,NA,NA,NA,"AUG",2019,11,"4",NA,NA,NA,"548","557",NA,"10.1111/1758-2229.12757","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1758-2229.12757",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30970176,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000474226700008",NA,6703,"Both"

In B. eriopoda (black grama), significant increases in plant biomass were not observed. However, early plant heights and crown diameters, establishment rates, and stolon production were higher in some callus treatments. In S. cryptandrus (sand dropseed), all variables were positively influenced by one or more of the endophyte treatments. Biomass increases ranged from 2.5- to threefold over untreated plants, and harvested seed increased 5.9-fold in plants treated with endophytes from A. canescens (fourwing saltbush).

Relative to typical S. alterniflora, this dwarf ecotype has one-fifth the tiller height (similar to 21 cm), tenfold the tiller density (similar to 4000 tillers/m(2)), and is restricted to growth in the upper intertidal zone. Chromosome counts of the dwarfs are identical to typical smooth cordgrass (2n = 62), and smooth cordgrass-specific random amplified DNA markers confirm the species identity of the dwarf.

The dwarf condition is not caused by endophytic fungi.

Here, we explore the role of fungal root symbionts as predictors of the soil and root-associated microbiomes of widespread broad-leaved trees across a European latitudinal gradient. Our results suggest that, alongside factors such as climate, soil, and vegetation properties, root colonization by ectomycorrhizal, arbuscular mycorrhizal, and dark septate endophytic fungi also shapes tree-associated microbiomes. Notably, the structure of root and soil microbiomes across our sites ismore strongly and consistently associated with dark septate endophyte colonization than with mycorrhizal colonization and many abiotic factors. Root colonization by dark septate endophytes also has a consistent negative association with the relative abundance and diversity of nutrient cycling genes. Our study not only indicates that root-symbiotic interactions are an important factor structuring soil communities and functions in forest ecosystems, but also that the hitherto less studied dark septate endophytes are likely to be central players in these interactions.","Netherway, T; Bengtsson, J; Buegger, F; Fritscher, J; Oja, J; Pritsch, K; Hildebrand, F; Krab, EJ; Bahram, M",NA,NA,NA,"Netherway, Tarquin; Bengtsson, Jan; Buegger, Franz; Fritscher, Joachim; Oja, Jane; Pritsch, Karin; Hildebrand, Falk; Krab, Eveline J.; Bahram, Mohammad",NA,"Pervasive associations between dark septate endophytic fungi with tree root and soil microbiomes across Europe","NATURE COMMUNICATIONS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bahram, Mohammad/A-9766-2010; Hildebrand, Falk/K-1914-2014","Hildebrand, Falk/0000-0002-0078-8948; Netherway, Tarquin/0000-0002-9049-9225",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2041-1723",NA,NA,NA,"JAN 2",2024,15,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1038/s41467-023-44172-4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-44172-4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38167673,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001158425400018",NA,8960,"Both"
"39","Plants harbor in their external surfaces and internal tissues a highly diverse and finely structured microbial assembly, the microbiota. Each plant compartment usually represents a unique ecological niche hosting a distinct microbial community and niche differentiation, which may mirror distinct functions of a specialized microbiota, has been mainly investigated for bacteria. Far less is known for the fungal components of the plant-associated microbiota. Here, we applied a metabarcoding approach to describe the fungal assemblages in different organs of Vaccinium myrtillus plants (Ericaceae) collected in a subalpine meadow in North-West Italy, and identified specific taxa enriched in internal tissues of roots, stems, leaves and flowers. We also traced the distribution of some important fungi commonly associated with plants of the family Ericaceae, namely the ericoid mycorrhizal (ErM) fungi and the dark septate endophytes (DSE), both playing important roles in plant growth and health. Operational taxonomic units attributed to established ErM fungal species in the genus Hyaloscypha and to DSE species in the Phialocephala-Acephala applanata complex (PAC) were found in all the plant organs. Mycorrhizal fungi are thought to be strictly associated with the plant roots, and this first observation of ErM fungi in the above-ground organs of the host plant may be explained by the evolutionary closeness of ErM fungi in the genus Hyaloscypha with non mycorrhizal fungal endophytes. This is also witnessed by the closer similarities of the ErM fungal genomes with the genomes of plant endophytes than with those of other mycorrhizal fungi, such as arbuscular or ectomycorrhizal fungi.","Daghino, S; Martino, E; Voyron, S; Perotto, S",NA,NA,NA,"Daghino, Stefania; Martino, Elena; Voyron, Samuele; Perotto, Silvia",NA,"Metabarcoding of fungal assemblages in <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> endosphere suggests colonization of above-ground organs by some ericoid mycorrhizal and DSE fungi","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Martino, Elena/KJD-5112-2024; Daghino, Stefania/AAO-7718-2021; VOYRON, Samuele/ABG-2929-2020","DAGHINO, Stefania/0000-0001-5722-1558",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2045-2322",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JUN 30",2022,12,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1038/s41598-022-15154-1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-15154-1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35773465,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001014944000039",NA,6215,"Both"
"40","Background. Plants possess a sophisticated immune system to defend from herbivores. These defence responses are regulated by plant hormones including salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA). Sometimes, plant defences can be complemented by the presence of symbiotic microorganisms. A remarkable example of this are grasses establishing symbiotic associations with Epichloe fungal endophytes. We studied the level of resistance provided by the grass' defence hormones, and that provided by Epichloe fungal endophytes, against an introduced herbivore aphid. These fungi protect their hosts against herbivores by producing bioactive alkaloids. We hypothesized that either the presence of fungal endophytes or the induction of the plant salicylic acid (SA) defence pathway would enhance the level of resistance of the grass to the aphid. Methods. Lolium multiflorum plants, with and without the fungal endophyte Epichloe occultans, were subjected to an exogenous application of SA followed by a challenge with the aphid, Sipha maydis. Results. Our results indicate that neither the presence of E. occultans nor the induction of the plant's SA pathway regulate S. maydis populations. However, endophytesymbiotic plants may have been more tolerant to the aphid feeding because these plants produced more aboveground biomass. We suggest that this insect insensitivity could be explained by a combination between the ineffectiveness of the specific alkaloids produced by E. occultans in controlling S. maydis aphids and the capacity of this herbivore to deal with hormone-dependent defences of L. multiflorum.","Bastías, DA; Martínez-Ghersa, MA; Newman, JA; Card, SD; Mace, WJ; Gundel, PE",NA,NA,NA,"Bastias, Daniel A.; Alejandra Martinez-Ghersa, Maria; Newman, Jonathan A.; Card, Stuart D.; Mace, Wade J.; Gundel, Pedro E.",NA,"<i>Sipha maydis</i> sensitivity to defences of <i>Lolium multiflorum</i> and its endophytic fungus <i>Epichloe</i> occultans","PEERJ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Bastias, Daniel/AFN-3093-2022; Newman, Jonathan/A-5932-2008","Bastias, Daniel A./0000-0002-0522-5538; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Card, Stuart/0000-0001-7140-7471; Newman, Jonathan/0000-0003-3155-4084",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2167-8359",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DEC 18",2019,7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.7717/peerj.8257","http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.8257",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31976166,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000503384400005",NA,1165,"Both"

"42","Fungal endophytes of tropical trees are expected to be exceptionally species rich as a consequence of high tree diversity in the tropics and the purported host restriction among the endophytes. Based on this premise, endophytes have been regarded as a focal group for estimating fungal numbers because their possible hyperdiverse nature would reflect significantly global fungal diversity. We present our consolidated ten-year work on 75 dicotyledonous tree hosts belonging to 33 families and growing in three different types of tropical forests of the NBR in the Western Ghats, southern India. We conclude that endophyte diversity in these forests is limited due to loose host affiliations among endophytes. Some endophytes have a wide host range and colonize taxonomically disparate hosts suggesting adaptations in them to counter a variety of defense chemicals in their hosts. Furthermore, such polyphagous endophytes dominate the endophyte assemblages of different tree hosts. Individual leaves may be densely colonized but only by a few endophyte species. It appears that the environment (the type of forest in this case) has a larger role in determining the endophyte assemblage of a plant host than the taxonomy of the host plant. Thus, different tropical plant communities have to be studied for their endophyte diversity to test the generalization that endophytes are hyperdiverse in the tropics, estimate their true species richness, and use them as a predictor group for more accurate assessment of global fungal diversity.","Suryanarayanan, TS; Murali, TS; Thirunavukkarasu, N; Rajulu, MBG; Venkatesan, G; Sukumar, R",NA,NA,NA,"Suryanarayanan, T.

"44","Needle pathogens cause the discoloration, death, or premature abscission of conifer foliage, reducing growth and vigor, and repeated defoliation may eventually result in tree mortality. Since 2016, forest managers in the southeast United States have reported the increasing scale, frequency, and severity of needle disease outbreaks on the region's principal timber species, loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.). These recent outbreaks are raising concern throughout the region, as needle diseases are not traditionally considered a threat to P. taeda. Lecanosticta acicola (Thum.) Syd., the native causal agent of brown-spot needle blight, has been recovered from some outbreaks. However, the full array of fungi associated with symptoms has not been explored. In this research, P. taeda foliage was collected from affected stands throughout the region and analyzed to identify fungi associated with needle disease symptoms. We employed targeted molecular diagnostics to confirm the presence or absence of L. acicola and DNA metabarcoding to characterize the foliar mycobiome and screen for other potential pathogens. L. acicola was detected among symptomatic needles from multiple states, particularly in western portions of the P. taeda range, but rarely from stands in eastern states. Metabarcoding revealed pathogens in needles and identified associations among pathogenic fungi, differing symptoms (including needle discoloration and necrosis), and signs of fungal fruiting bodies. Additionally, the fungal community of needles varied with patterns of symptom presentation. This study is the first regionwide assessment of fungi associated with recent large-scale needle disease outbreaks on P. taeda and identifies multiple pathogens that warrant further study.","Meinecke, CD; Niyas, AMM; McCarty, E; Quesada, T; Smith, JA; Villari, C",NA,NA,NA,"Meinecke, Colton D.; Niyas, Afaq M.

"48","Different forms of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal inoculum are found in soil patches with differing histories. These inoculum types include spores, infected root fragments, and extramatrical hyphae. Utilizing root observation chambers, detailed observations were made of the growth dynamics of mycorrhizal hyphae from inoculum sources to roots and the subsequent radiation out from individual colonized root segments. There were several types of hyphal architecture classified by whether the external hyphae were entering (infecting) a plant root or developing from the root surface and growing out into the soil matrix. Morphologically, individual hyphal filaments within all architectural types looked quite similar and clear architectural differences could only be identified when distinct sets of interconnected hyphal filaments were studied. The primary hyphal architectural types observed in the soil were classified as runner hyphae, hyphal bridges, absorptive hyphal networks, germ tubes, and infection networks produced by spores and root fragments. The specialized hyphal architectures of these fungal endophytes appear to be linked to the unique function of each hyphal type. Runner hyphae and infection networks from either spores or root fragments were observed to be capable of infecting new root segments. Absorptive hyphal networks were never observed to act as units of infection and were classified as structures primarily involved in the acquisition of soil resources.

"50","Laboratory tests demonstrated that ''Repell,'' a cultivar of perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne, L., infected with the fungal endophyte, Acremonium lolii Latch, Christensen and Samuels, exhibited a high level of insect resistance to the hairy chinch bug, Blissus leucopterus hirtus Montandon. First and third instars and adult hairy chinch bugs reared on endophyte-infected plants had significantly lower survival. On endophyte-free ''Repell,'' nymphs and adults resided primarily on the leaf sheath. In contrast, on endophyte-infected ''Repell,'' nymphs and adults either avoided the plant or resided only on the endophyte-free leaf blade. Nymphs were able to detect the presence of the endophyte in a choice test and consistently selected endophyte-free ''Repell.''

"51","Purpose Casuarina equisetifolia, a fast-growing, abundant tree species on the southeastern coast of China, plays an important role in protecting the coastal environment, but the ecological processes that govern microbiome assembly and within-plant microorganism transmission are poorly known. Methods In this paper, we used ITS and 16S amplification techniques to study the diversity of fungal and bacterial endophytes in critical plant parts of this species: seeds, branchlets, and roots. Additionally, we examined the litter of this species to understand the process of branchlets from birth to litter. Result We uncovered a non-random distribution of endophyte diversity in which branchlets had the greatest and seeds had the lowest endophytic fungal diversity. In contrast, litter endophytic bacteria had the highest diversity, and branchlets had the lowest diversity. As for fungi, a large part of the seed microbiome was transmitted to the phyllosphere, while a large part of the bacterial microbiome in the seed was transmitted to the root. Conclusion Our study provides comprehensive evidence on diversity, potential sources, and transmission pathways for non-crop microbiome assembly and has implications for the management and manipulation of the non-crop microbiome in the future.","Lin, Q; Xu, ZX; Li, MM; Wang, Y; Li, L",NA,NA,NA,"Lin, Qi; Xu, Zhixia; Li, Miaomiao; Wang, Ying; Li, Lei",NA,"Spatial differences in <i>Casuarina equisetifolia</i> L. endophyte community structure","ANNALS OF MICROBIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Xu, Zhixia/U-8027-2019; chen, meng/HJZ-2137-2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1590-4261","1869-2044",NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2022,72,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1186/s13213-022-01685-5","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13213-022-01685-5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000832715700001",NA,6380,"Absence"
"52","The plane tree is one of the most frequently used street trees in urban landscape in Iran and some Mediterranean countries and some age-old ones are found in these countries. Endophytes are microorganisms which associate with healthy plant tissues, persisting without causing diseases symptoms in the host and normally benefitting them through improving plant ability to withstand environmental stresses. In this contribution, the hypothesis of fungal endophytes existence in the plane trees as well as their relationship with morphological characteristics of trees and nutrient elements of leaves were studied in the central part of Iran. The experiment was performed according to an unbalanced completely randomized design. Approximate age and height of plane trees were recorded and then the greenness and visual appearance were evaluated. Healthy shoots and bark pieces were collected and surface sterilized then placed in petri dishes containing PDA. The results showed that endophytes frequency were significantly greater in age-old trees (60.04%) than young ones (39.96%). Endophytes existence had a positive correlation with iron (Fe) and potassium (K) concentrations of the leaves, and trees height and circumference. Also, there was a positive correlation between the presence of fungal endophytes and improved visual appearance of plane trees. The results suggest that fungal endophytes association enhanced nutrient elements assimilation in trees contributing at least partly to elevated survival of age-old plane trees.","Khorsandy, S; Nikbakht, A; Sabzalian, MR; Pessarakli, M",NA,NA,NA,"Khorsandy, Soheila; Nikbakht, Ali; Sabzalian, Mohammad R.; Pessarakli, Mohammad",NA,"Effect of fungal endophytes on morphological characteristics, nutrients content and longevity of plane trees (<i>Platanus orientalis</i> L.)","JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sabzalian, Mohammad R./E-6279-2013","Pessarakli, Mohammad/0000-0002-7662-2258",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0190-4167","1532-4087",NA,NA,NA,NA,2016,39,"8",NA,NA,NA,"1156","1166",NA,"10.1080/01904167.2015.1109113","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01904167.2015.1109113",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000379617800012",NA,8089,"Both"

"56","Premise Foliar fungal endophytes vary in their distributions across landscapes or plant host taxa, indicative of specialized ecologies and host specific adaptations. Accounts of specialization, however, depend on the taxonomic breadth and geographic range of the host plants included in each study. A broad region-scale study or deep sampling of diverse potential host species still remains relatively rare but is becoming increasingly possible with high-throughput sequencing. Methods Amplicon sequencing was used to rapidly identify the fungal endophytic community among six pine (Pinus, Pinaceae) species co-occurring across northeastern United States and to test for site and host specialization. We focused on the endophytic genus Lophodermium (Rhytismataceae), whose species' members are thought to specialize on different pine species, to test if amplicon sequencing could rapidly verify previously implied or discover new patterns of host specificity. Results While amplicon sequencing could analyze more samples at greater depths and recover greater numbers of unique Lophodermium taxa than when endophyte communities were surveyed with traditional culturing methods, patterns of specialization were not better supported. This may be because amplicon sequencing can indiscriminately capture non-host specific organisms found incidentally from plant tissues or because we have overestimated host-specificity in the past with biased culturing techniques. Conclusions Amplicon sequencing can quickly identify patterns of host specificity by allowing large-scale surveys but has limitations in quantifying the level of intimacy of these relationships.","Sarver, J; Schultz, E; Apigo, A; Gernandt, DS; Salas-Lizana, R; Oono, R",NA,NA,NA,"Sarver, Jake; Schultz, Ella; Apigo, Austen; Gernandt, David S.; Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo; Oono, Ryoko",NA,"Deep sequencing across multiple host species tests pine-endophyte specificity","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo/LCL-2439-2024","Apigo, Austen/0000-0002-2525-0394; Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo/0000-0002-0761-2910; Gernandt, David/0000-0002-3592-994X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0002-9122","1537-2197",NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2022,109,"1",NA,NA,NA,"83","98",NA,"10.1002/ajb2.1792","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.1792",NA,"JAN 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,34695224,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000743763200001",NA,6314,"Absence"

In this study, we investigated how disturbance and biotic interactions with pathogens and microbial symbionts mediate invasion of American beachgrass (Ammophila breviligulata) in early-and late-successional coastal dune habitats. First, we tested the effect of disturbance on biomasses of two exotic beachgrass species (the invading A. breviligulata and the established A. arenaria) and a native beachgrass (Elymus mollis) by growing plants with and without a disturbance manipulation in early-and late-successional habitats. We quantified root colonization by fungal symbionts and infection by plant-parasitic nematodes to determine the effect of potential mutualists and pathogens on plant biomass. Second, we tested whether soil microbes associated with the established A. arenaria mediated A. breviligulata invasion by inoculating potted plants with microbes from early-and late-successional habitat. We found no effect of disturbance on biomass of the invading A. breviligulata or native E. mollis, whereas A. arenaria biomass increased when grown with disturbance. Colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and by fungal endophytes were poor predictors of plant biomass, and plant-parasitic nematodes were infrequently observed. Microbe addition increased belowground biomass of A. breviligulata, but not A. arenaria, compared to control treatments. Overall, our results suggest that A. breviligulata invasion in both the early-and late-successional habitat is mediated by its lack of disturbance dependence and positive effects of soil microbes.

However, in the absence of functional studies the influence of these endophytes on the extended phenotype of the host plant is unclear. In this study we demonstrate that fungal endophytes from Pinus monticola were effective at increasing survival in host plants against the exotic pathogen Cronartium ribicola, which is responsible for the devastating disease called white pine blister rust. Seedlings previously inoculated with fungal endophytes lived longer than endophyte-free seedlings and also showed some reduction in white pine blister rust disease severity. This endophyte-mediated resistance was found to be effective over time, indicating persistence, and is hypothesised to be a form of induced resistance. Overall, this suggests fungal endophytes may play a determinative role in the structure of biological communities and could provide a useful alternative or ancillary management tool for combating pests and diseases.

"61","Fungal endophyte community amplicon sequencing can lose a significant number of informative reads due to host-plant co-amplification. Blocking of plant-specific sequences with peptide nucleic acid (PNA) clamps has been shown to improve metrics of detected microbial diversity in studies targeting 16S and 18S regions of rRNA genes. However, PNA clamping has not been applied to the plant ITS region of rRNA gene - a widely accepted fungal marker. By applying PNA clamping technique to ITS amplicon sequencing of the endophytic fungal community of elderberry this study shows that PNA clamping significantly reduces host-plant co-amplification with the universal ITS1/ITS4 primer set. However, PNA clamping in combination with the discriminatory ITS1F/ ITS2 primer set did not improve the metrics of fungal endophyte community ITS amplicon Illumina sequencing. This study shows that PNA clamping does not add practical benefit to taxonomic profiling of plant-associated fungal communities if the primers are already specific enough to exclude amplification of host DNA.","Borodus, A; Nikolajeva, J; Fridmanis, D; Gudra, D; Ustinova, M; Senkovs, M; Nikolajeva, V",NA,NA,NA,"Borodus, Anete; Nikolajeva, Juris; Fridmanis, Davids; Gudra, Dita; Ustinova, Maija; Senkovs, Maris; Nikolajeva, Vizma",NA,"Does peptide-nucleic acid (PNA) clamping of host plant DNA benefit ITS1 amplicon-based characterization of the fungal endophyte community?","FUNGAL ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Fridmanis, Davids/I-3292-2017","Fridmanis, Davids/0000-0003-0310-0448; Gudra, Dita/0000-0002-9446-4521; Ustinova, Maija/0000-0001-7882-397X; Boroduske, Anete/0000-0003-0077-9811",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1754-5048","1878-0083",NA,NA,NA,"FEB",2023,61,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.funeco.2022.101181","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funeco.2022.101181",NA,"SEP 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000874540100005",NA,3605,"Absence"
"62","Monk fruit (Siraitia grosvenorii) is an herbaceous perennial vine of the Cucurbitaceae family cultivated commercially mainly in southern China. There is very little information available about the fungal endophytes in monk fruit. In this study, monk fruit plants were grown from seeds in a research greenhouse at Kwantlen Polytechnic University in British Columbia, Canada to explore the abundance and diversity of their fungal endophytes. Fungal endophytes were isolated from seeds, seedlings, mature monk fruit plants, and fruits, and cultured on potato dextrose agar and water agar media. Isolates were identified by microscopic examination and BLAST comparison of ITS sequences to published sequences in GenBank. At least 150 species of fungal endophytes representing 60 genera and 20 orders were recovered from monk fruit tissues. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) was carried out to explore the similarity of fungal communities among roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds based on fungal orders. Our study showed that monk fruit plants are a rich source of fungal endophytes with the greatest abundance and diversity in leaves. This work has deepened our understanding of the intricate interactions between plants and fungi that sustain ecosystems and underpin plant health and resilience. © 2024 The Authors.

"63","Plants are colonized by fungal endophytes. In this study we tested the hypothesis that endophyte communities in mountain plants changes along the elevation gradient. We identified fungal endophytes in aboveground parts and seeds of five plant species at altitudes of 1000-1750 m in the Tatra National Park. Endophytes isolated from them were grouped into morphotypes on the basis of macroscopic features, such as mycelium shape and colour. Isolates representing individual morphotypes were identified using molecular markers ITS1 and ITS2. When comparing species composition, we used Bray-Curtis distance matrices, calculated on the basis of frequency of the given fungal species. We identified 16 species of fungal endophytes. Five taxa were absent from seeds in spite of their occurrence in mother plant leaves. Differences in altitude were not significantly correlated with fungal species composition observed at a given sampling site. There was also no significant correlation between the species composition of leaf and seed mycobiota. This suggests imperfect vertical transmission in the studied plant species.","Wysoczanski, W; Wegrzyn, E; Olejniczak, P; Lembicz, M",NA,NA,NA,"Wysoczanski, Wojciech; Wegrzyn, Ewa; Olejniczak, Pawel; Lembicz, Marlena",NA,"Mycobiota diversity and its vertical transmission in plants along an elevation gradient in mountains","FUNGAL ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Węgrzyn, Ewa/AAK-9834-2020; Wysoczański, Wojciech/GZL-0029-2022","Lembicz, Marlena/0000-0003-1714-4716; Wegrzyn, Ewa/0000-0002-1403-6800; Wysoczanski, Wojciech/0000-0001-6238-4829",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1754-5048","1878-0083",NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2023,63,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.funeco.2023.101244","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funeco.2023.101244",NA,"APR 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000983258900001",NA,6166,"Both"
"64","Facultative fungal endophytes are unspecialized plant-associated fungi capable of colonizing plant tissues without causing symptoms of disease. Studies suggest facultative fungal endophytes enhance cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) plant defense against insect herbivores and might alter emissions of volatile organic compounds. We tested for changes in emissions of volatile organic compounds using cotton plants treated with facultative fungal endophtytes Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo-Crivelli) Vuillemin strain GHA and Phialemonium inflatum (Burnside) strain TAMU490 in the presence and absence of herbivory. Solid-phase micro-extraction was used to sample static headspace of individual leaves in collection chambers designed specifically for the experiment. Relative abundance of volatile organic compounds was significantly affected by herbivory, but differences caused by treatment with B. bassiana or P. inflatum were not significant. Findings showed our sampling method can be used to assess constitutive and herbivore-induced volatile organic compound profiles from individual leaves, but further studies need to investigate mechanisms underlying facultative fungal endophyte-mediated herbivore resistance in cotton.","Gale, CC; Suh, CPC; Perez, J; Lesne, P; Wilson, C; Kramer, Z; Madamba, C; Sword, GA",NA,NA,NA,"Gale, Cody C.; Suh, Charles P-C; Perez, Jose; Lesne, Pierre; Wilson, Caroline; Kramer, Zoey; Madamba, Christine; Sword, Gregory A.",NA,"Sampling Volatile Organic Compounds from Individual Cotton Leaves to Test Effects of Fungal Endophyte Treatments","SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pérez-Naranjo, José/JFT-1427-2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0147-1724","2162-2647",NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2021,46,"2",NA,NA,NA,"299","304",NA,"10.3958/059.046.0201","http://dx.doi.org/10.3958/059.046.0201",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000668593900001",NA,3328,"Both"
"65","Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), an important pasture grass also occurring on semi-natural grasslands. can form a mutualistic association with the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium lolii. The presence of this fungus is known to confer resistance against different insect pests although the occurrence is also associated with ryegrass stagger. a neurological disorder occasionally seen in livestock grazing on endophyte-infected pastures. In breeding context the benefit of this symbiotic association is of interest. Sixty-two Danish locations representing twelve different habitat types were visited and investigated for the occurrence of the perennial ryegrass endophyte. Most habitats were different types of semi-natural grassland. Perennial ryegrass was investigated using tissue print immunoblot to determine N. lolii infection status. Endophytes were found at 77% of the locations, infection ranging from 4 to 82%. The highest infection rates v ere found in communities, which had been grazed or intensively used by the public. This can probably be explained by an enhanced survival of endophyte-infected plants in a plant community where grazing and intensive use are environmental stress factors. The conclusion from these results is that management practice of semi-natural grasslands is considered a driving force toward higher endophyte infection rates in Denmark. The survey additionally provides the first indication that Neotyphodium ryegrass endophytes are widely spread in semi-natural grass communities in Denmark and high levels of infection are not only restricted to Mediterranean regions with summer drought.

"66","Microbes inhabiting the above- and belowground tissues of forest trees and soils play a critical role in the response of forest ecosystems to global climate change. However, generalizations about the vulnerability of the forest microbiome to climate change have been challenging due to responses that are often context dependent. Here we apply a risk assessment framework to evaluate microbial community vulnerability to climate change across forest ecosystems. We define factors that determine exposure risk and processes that amplify or buffer sensitivity to change, and describe feedback mechanisms that will modulate this exposure and sensitivity as climatic change progresses. This risk assessment approach unites microbial ecology and forest ecology to develop a more comprehensive understanding of forest vulnerability in the twenty-first century. In this Perspective, the authors develop a risk assessment framework for forest microbiomes under climate change that unites microbial and forest ecology.

"67","We demonstrate that native grass species from coastal and geothermal habitats require symbiotic fungal endophytes for salt and heat tolerance, respectively. Symbiotically conferred stress tolerance is a habitat-specific phenomenon with geothermal endophytes conferring heat but not salt tolerance, and coastal endophytes conferring salt but not heat tolerance. The same fungal species isolated from plants in habitats devoid of salt or heat stress did not confer these stress tolerances. Moreover, fungal endophytes from agricultural crops conferred disease resistance and not salt or heat tolerance. We define habitat-specific, symbiotically-conferred stress tolerance as habitat-adapted symbiosis and hypothesize that it is responsible for the establishment of plants in high-stress habitats. The agricultural, coastal and geothermal plant endophytes also colonized tomato (a model eudicot) and conferred disease, salt and heat tolerance, respectively. In addition, the coastal plant endophyte colonized rice (a model monocot) and conferred salt tolerance. These endophytes have a broad host range encompassing both monocots and eudicots. Interestingly, the endophytes also conferred drought tolerance to plants regardless of the habitat of origin. Abiotic stress tolerance correlated either with a decrease in water consumption or reactive oxygen sensitivity/generation but not to increased osmolyte production. The ability of fungal endophytes to confer stress tolerance to plants may provide a novel strategy for mitigating the impacts of global climate change on agricultural and native plant communities.","Rodriguez, RJ; Henson, J; Van Volkenburgh, E; Hoy, M; Wright, L; Beckwith, F; Kim, YO; Redman, RS",NA,NA,NA,"Rodriguez, Rusty J.; Henson, Joan; Van Volkenburgh, Elizabeth; Hoy, Marshal; Wright, Leesa; Beckwith, Fleur; Kim, Yong-Ok; Redman, Regina S.",NA,"Stress tolerance in plants via habitat-adapted symbiosis","ISME JOURNAL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1751-7362","1751-7370",NA,NA,NA,"APR",2008,2,"4",NA,NA,NA,"404","416",NA,"10.1038/ismej.2007.106","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2007.106",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18256707,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000255288700006",NA,9290,"Both"
"68","Increases in the frequency and intensity of hurricanes influence the structure, function, and resilience of Caribbean forests. Trees in such forests harbor diverse fungal endophytes within leaves and roots. Fungal endophytes often are important for plant health and stress responses, but how their communities are impacted by hurricanes is not well known. We measured forest disturbance in Carite State Forest in Puerto Rico ca. 16 months after the passage of Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm. In three sites, each comprising three plots representing a local gradient of hurricane disturbance, we evaluated soil chemistry and used culture-free analyses to measure richness, phylogenetic diversity, and composition of endophyte communities in leaves and roots. We found that endophyte richness did not vary significantly among plant families or as a function of soil chemistry. Instead, leaf endophytes peaked in richness and decreased in phylogenetic diversity at intermediate levels of disturbance. Root endophytes did not show such variation, but both leaf- and root endophyte communities differed in species composition as a function of disturbance across the forest. Locations with less disturbance typically hosted distinctive assemblages of foliar endophytes, whereas more disturbed locations had more regionally homogeneous endophyte communities. Together, our results show that changes in endophyte richness and phylogenetic diversity can be detected in aboveground tissues more than a year after major storms. In turn, pervasive shifts in endophyte community composition both aboveground and belowground suggest a subtle and lasting effect of hurricanes that merits further study, potentially contributing to the promotion of spatially heterogeneous endophyte assemblages at a landscape scale in these diverse island forests.","Carrión, NC; Troche, CL; Arnold, AE",NA,NA,NA,"Carrion, Nicole Colon; Troche, Chad Lozada; Arnold, A.

"69","Locoweeds are Astragalus and Oxytropis species that contain the toxic alkaloid swainsonine. Swainsonine accumulates in all parts of the plant with the highest concentrations found in the above ground parts. A fungal endophyte, Undifilum oxytropis, found in locoweed plant species, is responsible for the synthesis of swainsonine. By using quantitative PCR, the endophyte can be quantified in locoweed species. Endophyte amounts differ between plant parts and in some instances do not mirror the concentrations of swainsonine in the corresponding parts. Two groups of Oxytropis sericea were identified: one that accumulated high concentrations of swainsonine and another where swainsonine was not detected, or concentrations were near the detection threshold. The plants with high swainsonine concentrations had quantitatively higher amounts of endophyte. Alternatively, plants with low or no swainsonine detected had quantitatively lower endophyte amounts. In addition, swainsonine and endophyte concentrations were not distributed uniformly within the same plant when separated into stalks (leaves, scape(s), and flowers/pods). These findings provide evidence as to why plants in the same population accumulate different concentrations of swainsonine, and they have important implications for sampling of locoweed plants.","Cook, D; Gardner, DR; Ralphs, MH; Pfister, JA; Welch, KD; Green, BT",NA,NA,NA,"Cook, Daniel; Gardner, Dale R.; Ralphs, Michael H.; Pfister, James A.; Welch, Kevin D.; Green, Benedict T.",NA,"Swainsoninine Concentrations and Endophyte Amounts of Undifilum oxytropis in Different Plant Parts of Oxytropis sericea","JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0098-0331","1573-1561",NA,NA,NA,"OCT",2009,35,"10",NA,NA,NA,"1272","1278",NA,"10.1007/s10886-009-9710-9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-009-9710-9",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19904570,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000272034300014",NA,4883,"Both"

"71","Plant-associated microbes have been increasingly recognized for influencing host populations, plant communities, and even herbivores and predators. Thus, understanding factors that affect the distribution and abundance of microbial symbioses may be important for predicting the ecological dynamics of communities. Using endophytic fungi-grass symbioses, we explored how intrinsic traits of the symbiosis, specifically transmission mode, may influence symbiont frequencies in host populations. Combining published literature with new field surveys, we compared Epichloe endophytes, which had mixed horizontal and vertical transmission, with Neotyphodium endophytes, which were exclusively vertically transmitted from host plants to seeds. Exclusively vertical transmission should select against pathogenicity because symbionts depend entirely on hosts for reproduction. Across 118 host species, we found that Neotyphodium hosts had 40-130% higher symbiont frequencies than Epichloe hosts. In field surveys, endophyte frequency was positively correlated with the local density of hosts, but only for Epichloe, suggesting that contagiously spread Epichloe may attain higher frequencies when hosts are more abundant. Epichloe endophytes were also more likely than Neotyphodium to have imperfect vertical transmission; thus, hosts may reduce the transmission of more pathogenic symbionts to seeds. Results are consistent with the conclusion that the evolutionary transition to exclusively vertical transmission can alter patterns of symbiont frequency in nature.","Rudgers, JA; Afkhami, ME; Rúa, MA; Davitt, AJ; Hammer, S; Huguet, VM",NA,NA,NA,"Rudgers, Jennifer A.; Afkhami, Michelle E.; Rua, Megan A.; Davitt, Andrew J.; Hammer, Samantha; Huguet, Valerie M.",NA,"A fungus among us: broad patterns of endophyte distribution in the grasses","ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rúa, Megan/G-4187-2011","Rua, Megan A./0000-0002-2883-2795",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0012-9658","1939-9170",NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2009,90,"6",NA,NA,NA,"1531","1539",NA,"10.1890/08-0116.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-0116.1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19569368,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000266662500014",NA,6117,"Both"
"72","Exploring the regional pattern of variation in traits driven by symbiotic interactions may provide insights to understand the evolutionary processes that operate over plant populations. Polyploidy, which is associated with fitness improvement, is expected to increase with latitude and altitude. However, it has never been explored in relation with the occurrence of epichloid fungal endophytes in plants. Both, variation in ploidy level and in the incidence of fungal endophytes, are known to occur in species of fine fescues. Here, we surveyed the occurrence of systemic fungal endophytes in natural Festuca vivipara populations in North European islands. In addition, we identified the fungal species associated with this grass and determined the predominant ploidy level for each population. Endophytes were found in four of six, two of three, and one of three populations for Faroe Islands, Iceland and Great Britain, respectively. With an average low incidence level of 15 % in infected populations, there was no relationship between infection level and either latitude or altitude. The phylogenetic analysis based on sequences ITS and the tub2 genes, supports that the endophytic species is EpichloA << festucae, the same as in other fine fescues. We found no variation in ploidy level as all the plants were tetraploid (4X) with 28 chromosomes, a pattern which contrasts with the variation reported in previous antecedents. Our results suggest that apart from low and variable benefits of the endophyte to the plants, there would be a complex dynamics between epichloid endophytes and species of the fine fescue complex which merits further studies.","Gundel, PE; Dirihan, S; Helander, M; Zabalgogeazcoa, I; Väre, H; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, P.

"73","Non-native Phragmites australis decreases biodiversity and produces dense stands in North America. We surveyed the endophyte communities in the stems, leaves and roots of collections of P. australis obtained from two sites with a low and high salt concentration to determine differences in endophyte composition and assess differences in functional roles of microbes in plants from both sites. We found differences in the abundance, richness and diversity of endophytes between the low saline collections (18 species distributed in phyla Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Stramenopiles (Oomycota); from orders Dothideales, Pleosporales, Hypocreales, Eurotiales, Cantharellales and Pythiales; Shannon H = 2.639; Fisher alpha = 7.335) and high saline collections (15 species from phylum Ascomycota; belonging to orders Pleosporales, Hypocreales, Diaporthales, Xylariales and Dothideales; Shannon H = 2.289; Fisher alpha = 4.181). Peyronellaea glomerata, Phoma macrostoma and Alternaria tenuissima were species obtained from both sites. The high salt endophyte community showed higher resistance to zinc, mercury and salt stress compared to fungal species from the low salt site. These endophytes also showed a greater propensity for growth promotion of rice seedlings (a model species) under salt stress. The results of this study are consistent with the 'habitat-adapted symbiosis hypothesis' that holds that endophytic microbes may help plants adapt to extreme habitats. The capacity of P. australis to establish symbiotic relationships with diverse endophytic microbes that enhance its tolerance to abiotic stresses could be a factor that contributes to its invasiveness in saline environments. Targeting the symbiotic associates of P. australis could lead to more sustainable control of non-native P. australis.","Soares, MA; Li, HY; Kowalski, KP; Bergen, M; Torres, MS; White, JF",NA,NA,NA,"Soares, Marcos Antonio; Li, Hai-Yan; Kowalski, Kurt P.; Bergen, Marshall; Torres, Monica S.; White, James Francis",NA,"Evaluation of the functional roles of fungal endophytes of <i>Phragmites australis</i> from high saline and low saline habitats","BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"White, James/C-2280-2009; Kowalski, Kurt/GXZ-5008-2022; Soares, Marcos Antonio/B-7683-2013","Kowalski, Kurt/0000-0002-8424-4701; White, James/0000-0002-6780-7066; Soares, Marcos Antonio/0000-0002-8938-3188",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1387-3547","1573-1464",NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2016,18,"9",NA,"SI",NA,"2689","2702",NA,"10.1007/s10530-016-1160-z","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-016-1160-z",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000382136500022",NA,5428,"Both"
"74","Epichloid endophytes are well known symbionts of many cool-season grasses that may alleviate environmental stresses for their hosts. For example, endophytes produce alkaloid compounds that may be toxic to invertebrate or vertebrate herbivores. Achnatherum robustum, commonly called sleepygrass, was aptly named due to the presence of an endophyte that causes toxic effects to livestock and wildlife. Variation in alkaloid production observed in two A. robustum populations located near Weed and Cloudcroft in the Lincoln National Forest, New Mexico, suggests two different endophyte species are present in these populations. Genetic analyses of endophyte-infected samples revealed major differences in the endophyte alkaloid genetic profiles from the two populations, which were supported with chemical analyses. The endophyte present in the Weed population was shown to produce chanoclavine I, paspaline, and terpendoles, so thus resembles the previously described EpichloA << funkii. The endophyte present in the Cloudcroft population produces chanoclavineI, ergonovine, lysergic acid amide, and paspaline, and is an undescribed endophyte species. We observed very low survival rates for aphids feeding on plants infected with the Cloudcroft endophyte, while aphid survival was better on endophyte infected plants in the Weed population. This observation led to the hypothesis that the alkaloid ergonovine is responsible for aphid mortality. Direct testing of aphid survival on oat leaves supplemented with ergonovine provided supporting evidence for this hypothesis. The results of this study suggest that alkaloids produced by the Cloudcroft endophyte, specifically ergonovine, have insecticidal properties.","Shymanovich, T; Saari, S; Lovin, ME; Jarmusch, AK; Jarmusch, SA; Musso, AM; Charlton, ND; Young, CA; Cech, NB; Faeth, SH",NA,NA,NA,"Shymanovich, Tatsiana; Saari, Susanna; Lovin, Mary E.; Jarmusch, Alan K.; Jarmusch, Scott A.; Musso, Ashleigh M.; Charlton, Nikki D.; Young, Carolyn A.; Cech, Nadja B.; Faeth, Stanley H.",NA,"Alkaloid Variation Among Epichloid Endophytes of Sleepygrass (<i>Achnatherum robustum</i>) and Consequences for Resistance to Insect Herbivores","JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Young, Carolyn/Q-2963-2019; Jarmusch, Alan/AAH-5780-2019; Jarmusch, Scott/ABA-9399-2021; Tall, Susanna/A-1677-2016","Jarmusch, Scott/0000-0002-1021-1608; Young, Carolyn/0000-0003-0406-8398; Tall, Susanna/0000-0002-3746-4728; Charlton, Nikki/0000-0001-9580-5466",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0098-0331","1573-1561",NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2015,41,"1",NA,NA,NA,"93","104",NA,"10.1007/s10886-014-0534-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-014-0534-x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25501262,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000348424800012",NA,3220,"Both"

"77","Europe is the world largest grape producer, but in recent years, the report of diseases due to infection by grapevine trunk pathogens (GTPs) is becoming one of the main constraints for viticulture. Among grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs), esca syndrome is one of the most complex, characterized by simultaneous infection of several fungi, which leads to important reduction in yield and quality. Previous characterization of fungal isolates associated with esca syndrome leads to the recognition of at least three important players: Phaeocremonium minimum, Phaemoniella chlamydospora and Fomitiporia mediterranea. Here we isolated and characterized molecularly fungal endophytes directly from field wood tissues of plants showing or not esca symptoms. In addition, to better characterize such collection, a deep RNA sequencing (100 M reads in paired-end) to screen for mycovirus presence was performed. Thirty-nine viral genomes were detected, 38 of which were putative new viral species; some of these viruses infected GTPs, including P. minimum and F. mediterranea. In this work, we reported for the first time a curated collection of grapevine fungal endophytes identifying the associated mycoviruses some of which could be employed in future biotechnological exploitation as biological control agents for sustainable plant protection.","Nerva, L; Turina, M; Zanzotto, A; Gardiman, M; Gaiotti, F; Gambino, G; Chitarra, W",NA,NA,NA,"Nerva, Luca; Turina, Massimo; Zanzotto, Alessandro; Gardiman, Massimo; Gaiotti, Federica; Gambino, Giorgio; Chitarra, Walter",NA,"Isolation, molecular characterization and virome analysis of culturable wood fungal endophytes in esca symptomatic and asymptomatic grapevine plants","ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Nerva, Luca/AAA-9106-2020; CHITARRA, WALTER/O-1353-2015; Turina, Massimo/B-7550-2015; GAMBINO, GIORGIO/B-8439-2015","CHITARRA, WALTER/0000-0002-5382-3794; Gardiman, Massimo/0000-0003-4541-1201; Turina, Massimo/0000-0002-9659-9470; NERVA, LUCA/0000-0001-5009-5798; GAMBINO, GIORGIO/0000-0003-1590-4478",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1462-2912","1462-2920",NA,NA,NA,"AUG",2019,21,"8",NA,NA,NA,"2886","2904",NA,"10.1111/1462-2920.14651","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1462-2920.14651",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31081982,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000478609900017",NA,3282,"Absence"
"78","A trade-off between growth and defence functions is commonly observed in plants. We propose that the association of plants with Epichloe fungal endophytes may eliminate this trade-off. This would be a consequence of the double role of these endophytes in host plants: the stimulation of plant growth hormones (e.g. gibberellins) and the fungal production of antiherbivore alkaloids. We put forward a model that integrates this dual effect of endophytes on plant growth and defence and test its predictions by means of metaanalysis of published literature. Our results support the notion that the enhanced plant resistance promoted by endophytes does not compromise plant growth.

Most organisms host microbiota that shield against stressors. Here, we test the hypothesis that, by limiting exposure to temporally variable stressors, microbial symbionts reduce hosts' demographic variance. We parameterized stochastic population models using data from a 14-year symbiont-removal experiment including seven grass species that host Epichloe fungal endophytes. Results provide novel evidence that symbiotic benefits arise not only through improved mean fitness, but also through dampened inter-annual variance. Hosts with ""fast"" life-history traits benefited most from symbiont-mediated demographic buffering. Under current climate conditions, contributions of demographic buffering were modest compared to benefits to mean fitness. However, simulations of increased stochasticity amplified benefits of demographic buffering and made it the more important pathway of host-symbiont mutualism. Microbial-mediated variance buffering is likely an important, yet cryptic, mechanism of resilience in an increasingly variable world.","Fowler, JC; Ziegler, S; Whitney, KD; Rudgers, JA; Miller, TEX",NA,NA,NA,"Fowler, Joshua C.; Ziegler, Shaun; Whitney, Kenneth D.; Rudgers, Jennifer A.; Miller, Tom E.

Understanding how this disease impacts the plant's microbial communities is crucial for gaining insights into hostpathogen interactions. In this study, we investigated the changes in communities of bacterial and fungal endophytes inhabiting different compartments in healthy and diseased plants. We found that both alpha and beta diversities of endophytic communities do not change significantly by the pathogen infection. Rather, the type of plant compartment appeared to be the main driver of endophytic community structures. Although the overall structure seemed to be consistent between healthy and diseased plants, our analysis of differentially abundant taxa revealed the specific bacterial and fungal operational taxonomic units that exhibited enrichment in the root and leaf compartments of infected plants. These findings suggest that endophyte communities are robust to the changes at the early stage of pathogen infection, and that some of endophytes enriched in infected plants might have roles in the defense against the pathogen.","Roy, M; Burragoni, SG; Jeon, J",NA,NA,NA,"Roy, Mehwish; Burragoni, Sravanthi Goud; Jeon, Junhyun",NA,"Changes in Endophyte Communities across the Different Plant Compartments in Response to the Rice Blast Infection","PLANT PATHOLOGY JOURNAL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1598-2254","2093-9280",NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2024,40,"3",NA,NA,NA,"299","309",NA,"10.5423/PPJ.OA.12.2023.0175","http://dx.doi.org/10.5423/PPJ.OA.12.2023.0175",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38835301,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001240262000007",NA,8276,"Both"

Feasibility of endophytes in weed control was tested by manipulating endophyte colonization of meadow fescue (Scherodonus pratensis ex. Lolium pretense and Festuca pratensis) in three experiments. First, species richness, the cover percentages and biomass of detected species were estimated in replicated field plots seeded with endophyte-free (E-) or endophyte colonized (E+) meadow fescue. Four years after establishment of the grass monocultures, weed species richness and coverage was higher in E- plots compared to E+ plots. The cover percentages of meadow fescue decreased with weed invasions being 75% and 98% in E- and E+ plots, respectively. Similarly, the proportion of weeds in the total biomass was over 45% higher in E- plots compared to E+ plots at the end of the six years study. Half of the plots were subjected to herbivory by voles, but the effect of endophyte overrode the effect of herbivory. Second, the survival of individually grown E+ meadow fescues was higher and the plants were 50% larger and produced 54% more inflorescences than E- plants in a common garden experiment. Third, a seed germination test demonstrated that recruitment of new meadow fescues was not mediated by substances inhibiting seed germination potentially released by E+ plants. These results demonstrated that endophyte promoted competitive superiority of grass cultivars can hinder weed invasions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

"90","Impatiens glandulifera is one of the most widespread invasive plant species in the UK. Although aspects of its biology are known, there is little information about its association with microbial communities, both above ground and below ground. Furthermore, it is unknown whether this species exhibits any form of plant-soil feedback (PSF), commonly seen in other invasive weeds. We conducted a PSF experiment, in which plants of I. glandulifera were grown in soil that supported the species and compared with plants grown in a control soil from the same locality. Soil nutrients were measured, and the soil and foliar microbial communities were assessed. Impatiens glandulifera grew larger and faster in conditioned soil compared with the control. Higher levels of phosphate were also found in conditioned soils. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) colonisation was lower in conditioned soils, suggesting that I.glandulifera may rapidly alter AMF communities in invaded areas. PSFs had a significant effect on the foliar endophyte community, with clear separation of species between conditioned and control soils. These results show that I.glandulifera displayed a positive PSF and the PSF mechanism extended beyond the soil microbial community to affect foliar endophytes. The observed increase in endophytes in plants grown in conditioned soil could enhance resistance to herbivory, thus further accentuating the invasive properties of this species.","Pattison, Z; Rumble, H; Tanner, RA; Jin, L; Gange, AC",NA,NA,NA,"Pattison, Z.; Rumble, H.; Tanner, R.

"91","Piriformospora indica is an endophytic fungus of the Sebacinaceae family that colonizes the roots of a variety of plant species. As a result of this plant fungus association, plant benefits with respect to nutrient acquisition, resistance against biotic and tolerance to abiotic stress. The fungal hyphae form chla-mydospores after entering into the root cortex. Confocal microscope can be used for the detailed analysis of the fungal chlamydospores, its ultrastructure, morphology, sporulation, germination. Confocal microscopy captures the high resolution image of living as well as dead cells. This instrument helps to take three dimensional image of the objects as it eliminates out of focus glare by filtering the laser light along with confocal pinhole and excitation pinhole in front of detector, whereas in other microscopy techniques the entire sample is illuminated, including the area adjoining the area of interest which interferes with the analysis. The basic features which make confocal microscopy better than other microscopy techniques are removal of out of focus glare, shallow depth of field, optional sectioning, volume analysis, live cell imaging and lambda scanning. P. indica is grown and also the culture is maintained on Hill and Kaefer media at pH 6.5 and 30 °C. Batch as well as continuous fermentation can be used for the production of fungal biomass and spores. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Dabral S.; Bhola D.; Attri M.K.; Nath M.; Prasad R.; Singh S.; Varma A.",NA,"",NA,"Dabral, Surbhi (56581882000); Bhola, Diksha (57196467507); Attri, Manpreet Kaur (57196467519); Nath, Manoj (37040716200); Prasad, Ram (35171158300); Singh, Saumya (58732594400); Varma, Ajit (59157644900)",NA,"Principles and application of confocal microscopy to understand symbiotic fungi","Mycorrhiza - Nutrient Uptake, Biocontrol, Ecorestoration: Fourth Edition",NA,NA,"English","Book chapter",NA,"","","",NA,"","","Dabral S., Amity Institute of Microbial Technology, Amity University, E-3, Fourth Floor, Sector 125, Noida, 201313, India; Bhola D., Amity Institute of Microbial Technology, Amity University, E-3, Fourth Floor, Sector 125, Noida, 201313, India; Attri M.K., Amity Institute of Microbial Technology, Amity University, E-3, Fourth Floor, Sector 125, Noida, 201313, India; Nath M., Amity Institute of Microbial Technology, Amity University, E-3, Fourth Floor, Sector 125, Noida, 201313, India; Prasad R., Amity Institute of Microbial Technology, Amity University, E-3, Fourth Floor, Sector 125, Noida, 201313, India; Singh S., Amity Institute of Microbial Technology, Amity University, E-3, Fourth Floor, Sector 125, Noida, 201313, India; Varma A., Amity Institute of Microbial Technology, Amity University, E-3, Fourth Floor, Sector 125, Noida, 201313, India","Amity Institute of Microbial Technology, Amity University, E-3, Fourth Floor, Sector 125, Noida, 201313, India","A.

"92","Plant microbiomes are shaped by forces working at different spatial scales. Environmental factors determine a pool of potential symbionts while host physiochemical factors influence how those microbes associate with distinct plant tissues. These scales are seldom considered simultaneously, despite their potential to interact. Here, we analyze epiphytic microbes from nine Hibiscus tiliaceus trees across a steep, but short, environmental gradient within a single Hawaiian watershed. At each location, we sampled eight microhabitats: leaves, petioles, axils, stems, roots, and litter from the plant, as well as surrounding air and soil. The composition of bacterial communities is better explained by microhabitat, while location better predicted compositional variance for fungi. Fungal community compositional dissimilarity increased more rapidly along the gradient than did bacterial composition. Additionally, the rates of fungal community compositional dissimilarity along the gradient differed among plant parts, and these differences influenced the distribution patterns and range size of individual taxa. Within plants, microbes were compositionally nested such that aboveground communities contained a subset of the diversity found belowground. Our findings indicate that both environmental context and microhabitat contribute to microbial compositional variance in our study, but that these contributions are influenced by the domain of microbe and the specific microhabitat in question, suggesting a complicated and potentially interacting dynamic.","Bernard, J; Wall, CB; Costantini, MS; Rollins, RL; Atkins, ML; Cabrera, FP; Cetraro, ND; Feliciano, CKJ; Greene, AL; Kitamura, PK; Olmedo-Velarde, A; Sirimalwatta, VNS; Sung, HW; Thompson, LPM; Vu, HT; Wilhite, CJ; Amend, AS",NA,NA,NA,"Bernard, Jared; Wall, Christopher B.; Costantini, Maria S.; Rollins, Randi L.; Atkins, Melissa L.; Cabrera, Feresa P.; Cetraro, Nicolas D.; Feliciano, Christian K.

"93","Dark septate endophytes of the Phialocephala fortinii s.l. - Acephala applanata species complex (PAC) are abundant root colonizers of woody plants in boreal and temperate forest ecosystems where they form complex communities. Community structure was spatially stable for 3 years in a previous experiment, suggesting PAC's inability to disperse or mutual inhibition of neighboring PAC genotypes. The aim of this study was to test whether changes in PAC community structure occur at all. The community structure originally determined in 2004 was reassessed in 2014 in a Norway-spruce plantation using microsatellite genotyping. Most isolates belonged to Phialocephala turicensis, P. letzii, P. europaea, and P. helvetica in both years. P. uotilensis and Acephala applanata were rare. PAC species were the same at only two grid points in both years. P. europaea was more frequent than P. turicensis in 2004 whereas the situation was opposite in 2014. Only four of the 22 genotypes in 2004 were found in 2014. Interestingly, none of the genotypes was detected at the same grid points in both years. Extended sampling in 2014 led to a significantly higher number of grid points testing positive for the presence of P. turicensis and P. helvetica. More than 3 years are required to detect shifts in PAC community structures. The observed shifts suggest that PAC are able to disperse in soil or via root networks, though very slowly.","Stroheker, S; Queloz, V; Sieber, TN",NA,NA,NA,"Stroheker, Sophie; Queloz, Valentin; Sieber, Thomas N.",NA,"Spatial and temporal dynamics in the <i>Phialocephala fortinii</i> s.l. - <i>Acephala applanata</i> species complex (PAC)","PLANT AND SOIL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sieber, Thomas/JBJ-5736-2023","Queloz, Valentin/0000-0002-1888-4882",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0032-079X","1573-5036",NA,NA,NA,"OCT",2016,407,"1-2",NA,NA,NA,"231","241",NA,"10.1007/s11104-015-2790-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-015-2790-0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000385205100017",NA,2001,"Both"

"95","The endophytic fungus Aciculosporium take (Ascomycota; Clavicipitaceae) causes continuous shoot growth in bamboo. The colonized shoot eventually results in witches' broom formation but maintains normal leaf arrangement and branching pattern. To analyze the mechanism of well-regulated symptom development, the location of the fungal endophytic hyphae in host tissues was visualized. A colorimetric in situ hybridization technique using a species-specific oligonucleotide probe targeting the 18S rRNA of A. take was used. In situ hybridization was performed on tissue sections of diseased shoots with or without external signs of fungal colonization. Specific signals were detected in intercellular spaces of the bamboo tissues. Most signals were detected in the shoot apical meristem and the leaf primordia. In addition, fewer signals were detected in the lateral buds, juvenile leaves, and stems. These results indicate that A. take grows endophytically, particularly in the shoot apical meristem of the host.

"96","Variation in the abilities of 35 isolates of the ericoid mycorrhizal fungal endophyte Hymenoscyplus ericae from two held sites to utilise inorganic and organic nitrogen sources in axenic culture has been investigated. While most isolates showed a preference for NH4+ as a sole nitrogen source, considerable variation was observed in the abilities of isolates to utilise amino acids and protein (BSA). In particular, large intraspecific variation was observed for glutamine and BSA utilisation, with some isolates thriving on these substrates while others produced little growth. The data suggest that individual isolates of H. ericae may vary considerably in their abilities to supply their host plants with nitrogen from different substrates in soil.

"97","Locoweeds ( and ) are leguminous plants that are toxic due to a symbiotic association with the endophytic fungus . The fungus produces the alkaloid swainsonine, an alpha-mannosidase-inhibitor that causes serious damage to mammals when consumed. A real-time PCR technique was developed to quantify the colonization extent of in locoweeds and to compare it to the swainsonine concentration in the plants. Amplification of the endophyte nuclear ITS region allowed reliable quantification of DNA from field plants and cultures. Swainsonine concentration was highly correlated ( = 0.972, < 0.001) with the proportion of DNA during the first 4 weeks of culture growth. Species of and were sampled seasonally in New Mexico and Colorado for two years. High swainsonine concentration in plant samples was associated with high levels of endophyte DNA, except in plant reproductive tissues.","Böttger, JA; Creamer, R; Gardner, D",NA,NA,NA,"Boettger, Jorge Achata; Creamer, Rebecca; Gardner, Dale",NA,"Seasonal Changes in <i>Undifilum</i> Colonization and Swainsonine Content of Locoweeds","JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Achata Bottger, Jorge/0000-0002-8546-8133",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0098-0331",NA,NA,NA,NA,"MAY",2012,38,"5",NA,NA,NA,"486","495",NA,"10.1007/s10886-012-0120-z","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-012-0120-z",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,22544335,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000304208300006",NA,4882,"Absence"
"98","Agricultural crops growing in saline soils produce sub-optimal yields due to the negative effects of excess salts on plant growth and development. Salinity stress for crops is likely to increase as a result of climate change and the consequent salinisation of soils, particularly in coastal areas. In this study, we recovered fungal endophytes from the seeds of the wild barley relative Hordeum secalinum and tested their effects on a barley cultivar grown in a controlled environment under four levels of continuously applied salt stress: 0, 75, 150 and 250 mM NaCl. For the unstressed plants and plants stressed with 75 mM NaCl we found an endophyte-associated increase in early growth, grain dry weight, shoot dry weight, root dry weight, number of tillers, number of heads and number of grains. However, this relationship was reversed for the plants grown with 150 and 250 mM NaCl, where the endophytes negatively affected these traits. Plants stressed with the highest concentration of NaCl (250 mM) produced no grain. These results suggest that the endophytes may have potential to benefit field grown barley crops growing on moderately salt-stressed sites. © 2018 The Author(s).

"99","Microbial populations residing in close contact with plants can be found in the rhizosphere, in the phyllosphere as epiphytes on the surface, or inside plants as endophytes. Here, we analyzed the microbiota associated with Espeletia plants, endemic to the Paramo environment of the Andes Mountains and a unique model for studying microbial populations and their adaptations to the adverse conditions of high-mountain neotropical ecosystems. Communities were analyzed using samples from the rhizosphere, necromass, and young and mature leaves, the last two analyzed separately as endophytes and epiphytes. The taxonomic composition determined by performing sequencing of the V5-V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene indicated differences among populations of the leaf phyllosphere, the necromass, and the rhizosphere, with predominance of some phyla but only few shared operational taxonomic units (OTUs).

"100","Systemic fungal endophytes derive resources from hosts and can affect host resource movement and integration. We examined whether infection by Epichloe glyceriae altered clonal growth of its host, Glyceria striata, through changes in physiology. Growth of severed and intact stolons was compared to examine physiological integration in infected and disinfected (fungicide-treated) plants. To assess whether infection changed carbon (C) movement, labelling with C-14 was used. We found physiological integration did not affect biomass per stolon for either infected or disinfected plants. The severed stolon to intact stolon ratio for the number of daughter ramets within a plant did not differ by infection status, although fewer daughter ramets were produced on severed stolons of disinfected plants. C-14 movement from the labelled leaf was greater for infected stolons, whereas the labelled leaf retained more assimilate for stolons of disinfected plants. Previous studies showed that Epichloe glyceriae could increase host clonal growth. In this study, infection changed host assimilate distribution, but did not lead to corresponding differences in stolon growth.

"101","Despite being major drivers of the dynamics and diversity of plant populations and communities, the spatial variability of phyllosphere fungal assemblages has been seldom explored. We used CE-SSCP and 454 pyrosequencing to quantify the spatial variability of European beech phyllosphere fungal assemblages with a hierarchical sampling design including four different spatial scales (tree, branch, group of leaves and individual leaf). Fungal assemblages were highly diverse, with high proportions of generalist and cosmopolitan fungi. The major part of the variability was at the smallest spatial scale, between individual leaves. Within a single tree canopy, dissimilarity between fungal assemblages generally increased with distance between leaves. This pattern may be driven by within-canopy gradients of leaf traits and microclimate. At the stand scale, dissimilarity between fungal assemblages was correlated with the genetic distance rather than the geographic distance between trees, consistent with the findings of community genetics studies. Our results were constant over a small simulated sequencing depth, providing opportunities for the design of large-scale studies addressing the relationship between the genetic variation of trees and the variation of associated phyllosphere fungal assemblages.

"105","Didymoglossum (Hymenophyllaceae) is a monophyletic genus that includes small, epiphytic or epilithic plants. Three morphologically very similar species are found in the southern sector of the Yungas and Parana forests: D. hymenoides, D. krausii and D. reptans. The aim of this research was to characterise the morphoanatomy to better delimitate the taxa. Also, to evidence the presence of fungal endophytes. Conventional histological techniques were applied to fresh and FAA-fixed material. The anatomical structure of the different organs, in the three species, is similar; with collateral protostelic rhizomes, covered with simple or branched rhizoids; stipes teretes with glandular trichomes; uniestratified laminae formed by epidermal cells, with collateral vascular bundles; false veins formed by macrosclereids and stegmata or only by macrosclereids. The eglandular and glandular trichomes on the lamina differ in the species studied. The basal and middle portion of the involucre are pluristratified, with a vascular bundle at each margin, while the apical portion is formed by a one layer of epidermal cells; the receptacle is pluristratified with glandular trichomes on its surface. The presence of stegmata, collenchymatous tissue, sclerenchyma, mucilage fibers in phloem, pores in lamina and cuticle on the epidermis is evidenced and reported. Septate fungal endophytes were observed in epidermal cells of the rhizome, stipe and lamina of D. krausii and D. reptans. Species are differentiated by the following characters: shape of the lamina, diameter of the rhizome, number of false veins and the types of trichomes and pores.

CO2-induced changes in plant physiology can have ecosystem-wide implications and may alter plant-plant, plant-herbivore and plant-symbiont interactions. We examined the effects of three concentrations of CO2 (390, 800 and 1000ppm) and two concentrations of nitrogen fertilizer (0.004g N/week versus 0.2g N/week) on the physiological response of Neotyphodium fungal endophyte-infected and uninfected tall fescue plants. We used quantitative PCR to estimate the concentration of endophyte under altered CO2 and N conditions. We found that elevated CO2 increased the concentration of water-soluble carbohydrates and decreased the concentration of plant total amino acids in plants. Fungal-derived alkaloids decreased in response to elevated CO2 and increased in response to nitrogen fertilization. Endophyte concentration (expressed as the number of copies of an endophyte-specific gene per total genomic DNA) increased under elevated CO2 and nitrogen fertilization. The correlation between endophyte concentration and alkaloid production observed at ambient conditions was not observed under elevated CO2.

"107","The lolines are a class of bioprotective alkaloids that are produced by Epichloe species, fungal endophytes of grasses. These alkaloids are saturated 1-aminopyrrolizidines with a C2 to C7 ether bridge, and are structurally differentiated by the various modifications of the 1-amino group: -NH2 (norloline), -NHCH3 (loline), -N(CH3)(2) (N-methylloline), -N(CH3)Ac (N-acetylloline), -NHAc (N-acetylnorloline), and -N(CH3)CHO (N-formylloline). Other than the LoIP cytochrome P450, which is required for conversion of N-methylloline to N-formylloline, the enzymatic steps for loline diversification have not yet been established. Through isotopic labeling, we determined that N-acetylnorloline is the first fully cyclized loline alkaloid, implying that deacetylation, methylation, and acetylation steps are all involved in loline alkaloid diversification. Two genes of the loline alkaloid biosynthesis (LOL) gene cluster, lolN and lolM, were predicted to encode an N-acetamidase (deacetylase) and a methyltransferase, respectively. A knockout strain lacking both lolN and lolM stopped the biosynthesis at N-acetylnorloline, and complementation with the two wild-type genes restored production of N-formylloline and N-acetylloline. These results indicated that lolN and lolM are required in the steps from N-acetylnorloline to other lolines. The function of LolM as an N-methyltransferase was confirmed by its heterologous expression in yeast resulting in conversion of norloline to loline, and of loline to N-methylloline. One of the more abundant lolines, N-acetylloline, was observed in some but not all plants with symbiotic Epichloe siegelii, and when provided with exogenous loline, asymbiotic meadow fescue (Lolium pratense) plants produced N-acetylloline, suggesting that a plant acetyltransferase catalyzes","Pan, J; Bhardwaj, M; Nagabhyru, P; Grossman, RB; Schardl, CL",NA,NA,NA,"Pan, Juan; Bhardwaj, Minakshi; Nagabhyru, Padmaja; Grossman, Robert B.; Schardl, Christopher L.",NA,"Enzymes from Fungal and Plant Origin Required for Chemical Diversification of Insecticidal Loline Alkaloids in Grass-<i>Epichloe</i> Symbiota","PLOS ONE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pan, Juan/GSN-8862-2022; Nagabhyru, Padmaja/B-4263-2014; Schardl, Christopher/P-5655-2014","Bhardwaj, Minakshi/0000-0001-6544-7370; Schardl, Christopher/0000-0003-2197-0842",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1932-6203",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DEC 22",2014,9,"12",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0115590","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0115590",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25531527,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000348845100080",NA,7933,"Absence"

The hypothesis in this study was that the presence of EpichloA << coenophialum in the tall fescue shoot may alter chemical and biological properties of rhizospheric soil and, as a consequence, the soil hydraulic properties and aggregate stability in texture-dependent ways. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to characterize the effects of endophyte-tall fescue symbiosis on water repellency and hydraulic properties of the rhizosphere in six soil types. Aggregate water/ethanol sorptivities and water repellency were determined using a tension micro-infiltrometer. Soil organic carbon, hot-water soluble carbohydrates, basal soil respiration and water-dispersible clay as an index of aggregate instability were also measured. Endophytic symbiosis greatly enhanced soil organic carbon pools and hot-water soluble carbohydrates, especially for the medium- to fine-textured soils, and decreased the basal soil respiration. Changes in chemical and biological properties of the rhizosphere via endophyte infection and soil type altered the soil water repellency, hydraulic properties, and aggregate stability. Lower water sorptivity (due to hydrophobic coatings) and higher ethanol sorptivity (due to altered pore structure) were responsible for greater water repellency in the rhizosphere of endophyte-infected plants compared to endophyte-free ones. Greater sub-critical water repellency, organic carbon, and hot-water soluble carbohydrates induced by endophyte-tall fescue symbiosis could increase aggregate stability of the rhizosphere and facilitate ecosystem restoration in degraded arid lands.","Hosseini, F; Mosaddeghi, MR; Hajabbasi, MA; Sabzalian, MR",NA,NA,NA,"Hosseini, Fatemeh; Mosaddeghi, Mohammad R.; Hajabbasi, Mohammad A.; Sabzalian, Mohammad R.",NA,"Aboveground fungal endophyte infection in tall fescue alters rhizosphere chemical, biological, and hydraulic properties in texture-dependent ways","PLANT AND SOIL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hosseini Sedeh, Fatemeh/IAO-5027-2023; Sabzalian, Mohammad R./E-6279-2013; Hajabbasi, Mohammad/GLS-4685-2022; Mosaddeghi, Mohammad Reza/E-8925-2018","Mosaddeghi, Mohammad Reza/0000-0001-9730-3195; Hosseini, Fatemeh/0000-0002-3081-7367",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0032-079X","1573-5036",NA,NA,NA,"MAR",2015,388,"1-2",NA,NA,NA,"351","366",NA,"10.1007/s11104-014-2340-1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-014-2340-1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000350571500028",NA,4612,"Both"

Five endophyte strains were tested, and the trait that showed the greatest significant difference in the drought-stressed plants was the number of tillers, where all of the endophyte treatments induced a greater number of tillers per plant. However, except in one case, the mean dry root weight for all plants was greater in the control plants, indicating preferential allocation of resources to aboveground parts in the endophyte treatments.

"110","Experimental tests of community assembly mechanisms for host-associated microbiomes in nature are lacking. Asymptomatic foliar fungal endophytes are a major component of the plant microbiome and are increasingly recognized for their impacts on plant performance, including pathogen defense, hormonal manipulation, and drought tolerance. However, it remains unclear whether fungal endophytes preferentially colonize certain host ecotypes or genotypes, reflecting some degree of biotic adaptation in the symbioses, or whether colonization is simply a function of spore type and abundance within the local environment. Whether host ecotype, local environment, or some combination of both controls the pattern of microbiome formation across hosts represents a new dimension to the age-old debate of nature versus nurture. Here, we used a reciprocal transplant design to explore the extent of host specificity and biotic adaptation in the plant microbiome, as evidenced by differential colonization of host genetic types by endophytes. Specifically, replicate plants from three locally-adapted ecotypes of the native grass Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) were transplanted at three geographically distinct field sites (one home and two away) in the Midwestern US. At the end of the growing season, plant leaves were harvested and the fungal microbiome characterized using culture-dependent sequencing techniques. Our results demonstrated that fungal endophyte community structure was determined by local environment (i.e., site), but not by host ecotype. Fungal richness and diversity also strongly differed by site, with lower fungal diversity at a riparian field site, whereas host ecotype had no effect. By contrast, there were significant differences in plant phenotypes across all ecotypes and sites, indicating ecotypic differentiation of host phenotype.

"113","Plant water use theory has largely been developed within a plant-performance paradigm that conceptualizes water use in terms of value for carbon gain and that sits within a neoclassical economic framework. This theory works very well in many contexts but does not consider other values of water to plants that could impact their fitness. Here, we survey a range of alternative hypotheses for drivers of water use and stomatal regulation. These hypotheses are organized around relevance to extreme environments, population ecology, and community ecology. Most of these hypotheses are not yet empirically tested and some are controversial (e.g. requiring more agency and behavior than is commonly believed possible for plants). Some hypotheses, especially those focused around using water to avoid thermal stress, using water to promote reproduction instead of growth, and using water to hoard it, may be useful to incorporate into theory or to implement in Earth System Models.","Blonder, BW; Aparecido, LMT; Hultine, KR; Lombardozzi, D; Michaletz, ST; Posch, BC; Slot, M; Winter, K",NA,NA,NA,"Blonder, Benjamin Wong; Aparecido, Luiza Maria Teophilo; Hultine, Kevin R.; Lombardozzi, Danica; Michaletz, Sean T.; Posch, Bradley C.; Slot, Martijn; Winter, Klaus",NA,"Plant water use theory should incorporate hypotheses about extreme environments, population ecology, and community ecology","NEW PHYTOLOGIST",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Slot, Martijn/H-3179-2019; Michaletz, Sean/AAO-8175-2021; Aparecido, Luiza/AAC-4833-2021; Posch, Bradley/AAL-5329-2021","Teophilo Aparecido, Luiza Maria/0000-0001-8642-6632; Posch, Bradley/0000-0003-0924-6608; Slot, Martijn/0000-0002-5558-1792; Hultine, Kevin/0000-0001-9747-6037",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0028-646X","1469-8137",NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2023,238,"6",NA,NA,NA,"2271","2283",NA,"10.1111/nph.18800","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.18800",NA,"MAR 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,36751903,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000943956500001",NA,6107,"Absence"
"114","PREMISE OF THE STUDY:Fungal endophytes have been shown to colonize all land plants, yet surprisingly little attention has been given to their community composition in ferns. We examined the diversity and temporal turnover of fungal endophytes in foliar tissue of the temperate western sword fern, Polystichum munitum, comparing taxa in newly emerged leaflets and in the same fronds after 1 mo of exposure in the field. METHODS:Utilizing next-generation sequencing, we sampled pinnae from P. munitum in spring, 2-3 d after they emerged. We additionally sampled pinnae 30 d later from the same fern blades. From these samples, we sequenced fungal DNA to characterize the initial colonization and temporal turnover of endophytes in the host. KEY RESULTS:We demonstrate that P. munitum is abundantly colonized by endophytes in newly emerged foliar tissue. However, 1 mo later, the community composition undergoes a marked shift: the overall richness of endophytes increases, but the evenness of the community wanes as a single taxon, Flagellospora fusarioides, comes to dominate. CONCLUSIONS:We conclude that P. munitum hosts a variety of fungal endophyte taxa, similarly to other land plants. However, the rapid shift of the endophyte community we report is an unprecedented observation. Therefore, we further conclude that repeated sampling should be the standard in endophyte studies, because single sampling events are not sufficient to capture the dynamic nature of these cryptic microfungi.","Younginger, BS; Ballhorn, DJ",NA,NA,NA,"Younginger, Brett S.; Ballhorn, Daniel J.",NA,"Fungal endophyte communities in the temperate fern <i>Polystichum munitum</i> show early colonization and extensive temporal turnover","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0002-9122","1537-2197",NA,NA,NA,"AUG",2017,104,"8",NA,NA,NA,"1188","1194",NA,"10.3732/ajb.1700149","http://dx.doi.org/10.3732/ajb.1700149",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28814407,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000418649800007",NA,5719,"Absence"
"115","Azospirillum brasilense is a plant growth-promoting bacterium that is utilized as a bio-fertilizer worldwide. Inoculation of crops with A. brasilense can lead to a substantial boost in crop yield, although this enhancement is variable. Sometimes crop production is enhanced as much as 70% and other times enhancement does not occur at all. To solve this problem, a greater understanding of A. brasilense - plant interactions is needed. While the root/rhizosphere ecology of A. brasilense has been studied extensively there are no significant studies that address whether A. brasilense populates above ground plant tissues. In this study, we use a combination of qPCR, transcriptomics, confocal microscopy, and culturing techniques to map the in-planta distribution of a GFP-expressing A. brasilense in Phaseolus vulgaris (common bush bean). We show that A. brasilense constitute part of the plant bacterial microflora well above the root system. During P. vulgaris development A. brasilense was shown to actively move to developing bean seeds where it forms a significant intercellular population. GFP-expressing A. brasilense was shown to vertically transmit to successive plant generations demonstrating that A. brasilense in the seed constitute an effective inoculum. The ability of A. brasilense to not only colonize roots but to also actively migrate to developing seeds indicates the existence of a more complex symbiotic relationship than previously understood.","Malinich, EA; Bauer, CE",NA,NA,NA,"Malinich, Elizabeth A.; Bauer, Carl E.",NA,"The plant growth promoting bacterium <i>Azospirillum brasilense</i> is vertically transmitted in <i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> (common bean)","SYMBIOSIS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bauer, Carl/0000-0002-1432-0756",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0334-5114","1878-7665",NA,NA,NA,"OCT",2018,76,"2",NA,NA,NA,"97","108",NA,"10.1007/s13199-018-0539-2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-018-0539-2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000444580100002",NA,1036,"Absence"
"116","Soil contamination by metals is of particular interest, given that their retention times within the profile can be indefinite. Thus, phytostabilization can be viewed as a means of limiting metal toxicity in soils. Due to their ability to grow on contaminated soils, alders have repeatedly been used as key species in phytostabilization efforts. Alder ability to grow on contaminated sites stems, in part, from its association with microbial endophytes. This work emphasizes the fungal endophytes populations associated with Alnus incana ssp. rugosa and Alnus alnobetula ssp. crispa (previously A. viridis ssp. crispa) under a phytostabilization angle. Fungal endophytes were isolated from alder trees that were growing on or near disturbed environments; their tolerances to Cu, Ni, Zn, and As, and acidic pH (4.3, 3, and 2) were subsequently assessed. Cryptosporiopsis spp. and Rhizoscyphus spp. were identified as fungal endophytes of Alnus for the first time. When used as inoculants for alder, some isolates promoted plant growth, while others apparently presented antagonistic relationships with the host plant. This study reports the first step in finding the right fungal endophytic partners for two species of alder used in phytostabilization of metal-contaminated mining sites.","Lalancette, S; Lerat, S; Roy, S; Beaulieu, C",NA,NA,NA,"Lalancette, Steve; Lerat, Sylvain; Roy, Sebastien; Beaulieu, Carole",NA,"Fungal Endophytes of <i>Alnus incana</i> ssp. <i>rugosa</i> and <i>Alnus alnobetula</i> ssp. <i>crispa</i> and Their Potential to Tolerate Heavy Metals and to Promote Plant Growth","MYCOBIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Roy, Sébastien/A-5615-2008","Roy, Sebastien/0000-0001-7183-0691",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1229-8093","2092-9323",NA,NA,NA,"OCT 2",2019,47,"4",NA,NA,NA,"415","429",NA,"10.1080/12298093.2019.1660297","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/12298093.2019.1660297",NA,"SEP 2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,32010463,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000486979500001",NA,6840,"Both"

The frequency of individual infected plants of the different populations ranged mostly from 1% to 30%; a few populations showed higher infection levels, up to 80%. The contribution of endophyte-positive plants to the biomass of the original swards was estimated to range from 1% to 34%. Concentrations of the indole alkaloid lolitrem B detected in the endophyte-positive German ecotypes were similar to those in the endophyte-positive cultivars 'Ellett' and 'Grasslands Nui', originating in New Zealand, when all were cultivated under the climatic conditions of northern Germany. A seasonal variation in lolitrem B concentrations was observed from 1993 to 1996. The highest concentrations, 0.8-1.4 mg kg(-1) dry matter of herbage, were recorded during the months of July and August. These concentrations were not considered to be sufficient to induce 'ryegrass staggers', a neurological disorder in grazing animals.

"119","We have studied Picea glauca (white spruce) endophyte colonization and its affect on the growth of Choristoneura fumiferana (spruce budworm). Here we examine the spread and persistence of a rugulosin-producing endophyte and rugulosin in needles from trees maintained in the nursery, as well as in trees planted in a test field site. Additionally, we report toxicity of rugulosin against three P. glauca needle herbivores: C. fumiferana, Lamb-dina fiscellaria (hemlock looper) and Zeiraphera canadensis (spruce budmoth). Reduction in body weight for both the C fumiferana and L fiscellaria were observed at 25 and 50 mu m, respectively, and head capsules were reduced at 100 and 150 mu m. Z. canadensis larvae did not perform as well in tests due to an Aspergillus fumigatus infection, but were shown to be lighter when tested with 100 and 150 mu m compared with controls. The endophyte and its toxin were shown to spread throughout the nursery-grown seedlings. After 3.5 and 4.5 y post-inoculation (one and two years in the test site), the inoculated endophyte and its toxin had remained present with an average rugulosin concentration of 1 mu g g(-1).

"120","Persistence and ubiquity of vertically transmitted Neotyphodium endophytes in grass populations is puzzling because infected plants do not consistently exhibit increased fitness. Using an annual grass population model, we show that the problems for matching endophyte infection and mutualism are likely to arise from difficulties in detecting small mutualistic effects, variability in endophyte transmission efficiency and an apparent prevalence of non-equilibrium in the dynamics of infection. Although endophytes would ultimately persist only if the infection confers some fitness increase to the host plants, such an increase can be very small, as long as the transmission efficiency is sufficiently high. In addition, imperfect transmission limits effectively the equilibrium infection level if the infected plants exhibit small or large reproductive advantage. Under frequent natural conditions, the equilibrium infection level is very sensitive to small changes in transmission efficiency and host reproductive advantage, while convergence to such an equilibrium is slow. As a consequence, seed immigration and environmental fluctuation are likely to keep local infection levels away from equilibrium. Transient dynamics analysis suggests that, when driven by environmental fluctuation, infection frequency increases would often be larger than decreases. By contrast, when due to immigration, over-representation of infected individuals tends to vanish faster than equivalent over-representation of noninfected individuals.","Gundel, PE; Batista, WB; Texeira, M; Martínez-Ghersa, MA; Omacini, M; Ghersa, CM",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro E.; Batista, William B.; Texeira, Marcos; Martinez-Ghersa, M.

"121","Insect-induced galls are abnormal plant growths that can provide food and shelter to their inhabitants, resulting in stressed plant tissue that may alter the conditions for the colonization or proliferation of endophytic fungi. We investigated the effect gall formation has on fungal endophyte communities and diversity. Using three closely-related gall-forming aphid species that specialize on poplars, we characterized fungal endophyte diversity in galls and surrounding petiole and leaf lamina tissue. A total of 516 fungal endophyte samples were isolated from 272 tissue samples (32 leaves, 31 petioles, and 209 galls), resulting in 23 distinct morphotypes. Despite sharing a common host plant and often forming spatially contiguous galls, the endophyte profiles within the galls of each aphid species were distinct, not only from the galls of the other species, but also from surrounding plant tissue. These results suggest that insect galls can affect the composition of fungal endophyte species in plant tissues, by altering either the colonization or proliferation of their endophytic mycobiota. Likewise, fungal endophytes may be important in the ecology and evolution of insect galls.","Lawson, SP; Christian, N; Abbot, P",NA,NA,NA,"Lawson, Sarah P.; Christian, Natalie; Abbot, Patrick",NA,"Comparative analysis of the biodiversity of fungal endophytes in insect-induced galls and surrounding foliar tissue","FUNGAL DIVERSITY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1560-2745","1878-9129",NA,NA,NA,"MAY",2014,66,"1",NA,NA,NA,"89","97",NA,"10.1007/s13225-013-0268-z","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13225-013-0268-z",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000338140300005",NA,4620,"Both"
"122","In a pot trial, fungal endophytes (Neotyphodium spp.) with different alkaloid profiles were investigated for their effects on numbers of a root aphid (Aploneura lentisci) in perennial ryegrass. Some endophytes were also tested in different cultivars (Nui, Samson and Impact). Two endophytes, AR37 and AR6, strongly suppressed root aphid numbers. Wild-type had fewer aphids than endophyte-free plants and AR1. Endophytes producing peramine only (AR1, AR12, AR22) and an endophyte producing peramine and lolitrem B (AR23) did not differ from endophyte-free. There were no cultivar by endophyte interactions but cultivar affected the strength of aphid response to Wild-type. Comparisons of alkaloid profiles suggest that ergovaline (in Wild-type and AR6) and epoxy-janthitrems (in AR37) may affect root aphids whereas peramine and lolitrem B do not.

"123","Buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris), an invasive perennial grass in arid regions of the United States, has drastically modified natural ecosystems. Understanding the aboveground-belowground links between buffelgrass invasion and soil microbial communities will be critical for developing a comprehensive understanding of arid ecosystems and for deploying successful control strategies. In a randomized block-field experiment located in Tucson, AZ, U.S.A., we investigated the effects of buffelgrass removal via hand pulling and nitrogen addition (and their interaction) on soil microbial communities during an extreme drought (summer 2020). We found that experimental treatments did not significantly impact bacterial and archaeal community diversity and composition, while plant removal affected fungal community diversity and composition. In addition, the removal treatment increased the proportion of putative chitinolytic bacteria (genus Lysobacter) and decreased the proportion of putative fungal endophytes (genus Darksidea). Buffelgrass manual removal appeared to favor fungal endophyte death around and inside of leftover intact roots, which may result in an increase of chitinolytic bacteria thriving on the degradation of fungal cell walls. Overall, our results suggest that hand removal-which is a common type of buffelgrass control-can alter soil fungal communities and the proportion of certain microbial functional groups. As these changes could subsequently affect native plants, more research is needed to develop a comprehensive understanding of the effect of buffelgrass control efforts on target plants as well as surrounding ecosystem dynamics.","Williams, JP; Gornish, ES; Barberan, A",NA,NA,NA,"Williams, Jared P.; Gornish, Elise S.; Barberan, Albert",NA,"Effects of buffelgrass removal and nitrogen addition on soil microbial communities during an extreme drought in the Sonoran Desert","RESTORATION ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Barberan, Albert/A-5319-2013","Gornish, Elise/0000-0002-2055-4874",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1061-2971","1526-100X",NA,NA,NA,"FEB",2022,30,"2",NA,"SI",NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1111/rec.13570","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rec.13570",NA,"NOV 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000713404000001",NA,1582,"Both"
"124","There is interest in Canada wildrye (CWR, Elymus canadensis L.) and Virginia wildrye (VWR, E. virginicus L.) for conservation and forage uses. Our objectives were to identify a set of molecular markers to assess genetic structure within and diversity among populations of CWR and VWR from the Southern Great Plains and to determine if these populations had an associated fungal endophyte. Nine CWR and five VWR populations and two barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars were genotyped using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers isolated from tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh.] expressed sequence tags (TF ESTs). Scorable fragments were produced by 31% of TF EST-SSRs tested, thus identifying a set of SSR markers for wildrye. Populations grouped into three clusters consisting of (i) three wild populations, one plant introduction, and two commercial sources of CWR; (ii) all VWR populations and three CWR plant introductions; and (iii) barley cultivars. Clustering indicated possible gene flow between CWR and VWR. Genetic variation within populations was minimal and comparable to that of the barley cultivars. Thus, unlike many ancestral cultivars and landraces of self-pollinated crops, CWR and VWR populations consisted of essentially pure lines and can be handled as such in a breeding program. Potentially sexual and asexual epichloe endophytes were found in several populations, indicating the need to account for endophytes in breeding and germ-plasm conservation efforts of wildrye.","Saha, MC; Young, CA; Hopkins, AA",NA,NA,NA,"Saha, Malay C.; Young, Carolyn A.; Hopkins, Andrew A.",NA,"Genetic Variation within and among Wildrye (<i>Elymus canadensis</i> and <i>E</i>. <i>virginicus</i>) Populations from the Southern Great Plains","CROP SCIENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Young, Carolyn/Q-2963-2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0011-183X","1435-0653",NA,NA,NA,"MAY-JUN",2009,49,"3",NA,NA,NA,"913","922",NA,"10.2135/cropsci2008.04.0239","http://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2008.04.0239",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000266214500021",NA,8522,"Absence"

Responses and follow-up questions can facilitate exploration of such topics as the evolution of parasitism, plant adaptations to parasitism, impacts of parasites on native plant communities, and ways in which human intervention can foster the emergence of aggressive plant pathogens. This approach may help to attract students who would not have found their way to plant pathology through traditional pathways.

"126","Despite the widespread occurrence of fungal endophytes (FE) in plants inhabiting arid ecosystems, the environmental and soil factors that modulate changes in FE diversity and community composition along an aridity gradient have been little explored. We studied three locations along the coast of the Atacama Desert in Chile, in which the plant Aristolochia chilensis naturally grows, and that differ in their aridity gradient from hyper-arid to semi-arid. We evaluated if root-associated FE diversity (frequency, richness and diversity indexes) and community composition vary as a function of aridity. Additionally, we assessed whether edaphic factors co-varying with aridity (soil water potential, soil moisture, pH and nutrients) may structure FE communities. We expected that FE diversity would gradually increase towards the aridity gradient declines, and that those locations that had the most contrasting environments would show more dissimilar FE communities. We found that richness indexes were inversely related to aridity, although this pattern was only partially observed for FE frequency and diversity. FE community composition was dissimilar among contrasting locations, and soil water availability significantly influenced FE community composition across the gradient. The results indicate that FE diversity and community composition associated with A. chilensis relate to differences in the aridity level across the gradient. Overall, our findings reveal the importance of climate-related factors in shaping changes in diversity, structure and distribution of FE in desert ecosystems.","Guevara-Araya, MJ; Escobedo, VM; Palma-Onetto, V; González-Teuber, M",NA,NA,NA,"Jose Guevara-Araya, Maria; Escobedo, Victor M.; Palma-Onetto, Valeria; Gonzalez-Teuber, Marcia",NA,"Changes in Diversity and Community Composition of Root Endophytic Fungi Associated with <i>Aristolochia chilensis</i> along an Aridity Gradient in the Atacama Desert","PLANTS-BASEL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Palma, Valeria/AAG-1254-2020; González-Teuber, Marcia/ABH-2318-2021; Escobedo, Víctor/AAV-9690-2021","Gonzalez-Teuber, Marcia/0000-0003-0565-9333; Palma-Onetto, Valeria/0000-0002-0541-0135; Escobedo, Victor/0000-0003-2673-3803",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2223-7747",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2022,11,"11",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/plants11111511","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants11111511",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35684284,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000809471600001",NA,2062,"Both"
"127","Fungal endophytes comprise a highly diverse group of particular interest for their relevant implications to the ecosystems they inhabit. The objective of this study was to infer the phylogenetic affinity between strains of Peroneutypa scoparia exhibiting different lifestyles to elucidate possible shifts in ecological roles. Specimens and living cultures used in the present study were obtained from decaying wood and from live stem tissues of the invasive host species Broussonetia papyrifera. The similarity between the fungal strains was studied through molecular analyses. The results showed a close phylogenetic link and high genetic similarity between endophytic and saprotrophic strains. The main findings suggest that P. scoparia has primary access to the substrate as an endophyte and then this organism may change its use of the available resources presenting a saprotrophic growth.

"128","Compositional change in plant cell walls as a result of infection by non-host (putative) endophytes and a host pathogen were studied by quantifying plant cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) produced by these fungi, and by detecting cell wall changes via Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and relative lignin/carbohydrate intensity ratios. Oil palm ramets were first inoculated with homogenized fungal suspension. The treated fungal suspensions were assayed for CWDEs whereas the ramets were powderized for FTIR analysis. Results revealed that putative endophytes and host pathogen expressed all CWDEs, suggesting their probable roles in infection and colonization. Following inoculation, plant cell wall composition showed missing dips in spectra depicting changes to carbohydrate, xylan and lignin constituents. The indistinguishable FTIR spectra for putative endophyte-inoculated and pathogen-inoculated ramets suggest that both endophytes and pathogen have elicited similar responses to plant cell walls. Relative lignin/carbohydrate ratios further demonstrated that the putative endophytes did not breakdown lignin and carbohydrate, further exemplifying the non-pathogenic and asymptomatic infection by the endophytes.

"129","Complex intercellular interaction is a common theme in plant-pathogen/symbiont relationship. Cellular physiology of both the partners is affected by abiotic stress. However, little is known about the degree of protection each offers to the other from different types of environmental stress. Our current study focused on the changes in response to toxic arsenic in the presence of an endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica that colonizes the paddy roots. The primary impact of arsenic was observed in the form of hyper-colonization of fungus in the host root and resulted in the recovery of its overall biomass, root damage, and chlorophyll due to arsenic toxicity. Further, fungal colonization leads to balance the redox status of the cell by adjusting the antioxidative enzyme system which in turn protects photosynthetic machinery of the plant from arsenic stress. We observed that fungus has ability to immobilize soluble arsenic and interestingly, it was also observed that fungal colonization restricts most of arsenic in the colonized root while a small fraction of it translocated to shoot of colonized plants. Our study suggests that P. indica protects the paddy (Oryza sativa) from arsenic toxicity by three different mechanisms viz. reducing the availability of free arsenic in the plant environment, bio-transformation of the toxic arsenic salts into insoluble particulate matter and modulating the antioxidative system of the host cell.","Mohd, S; Shukla, J; Kushwaha, AS; Mandrah, K; Shankar, J; Arjaria, N; Saxena, PN; Narayan, R; Roy, SK; Kumar, M",NA,NA,NA,"Mohd, Shayan; Shukla, Jagriti; Kushwaha, Aparna S.; Mandrah, Kapil; Shankar, Jai; Arjaria, Nidhi; Saxena, Prem N.; Narayan, Ram; Roy, Somendu K.; Kumar, Manoj",NA,"Endophytic Fungi <i>Piriformospora indica</i> Mediated Protection of Host from Arsenic Toxicity","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kumar, Manoj/K-5427-2018; SHUKLA, JAGRITI/IQU-0123-2023","Kumar, Manoj/0000-0001-7500-4389",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-302X",NA,NA,NA,NA,"MAY 10",2017,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2017.00754","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.00754",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28539916,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000401502500001",NA,1848,"Absence"
"130","Background: Grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs) are disease complexes that are major threats to viticulture in most grapevine growing regions. The microbiomes colonizing plant belowground components form complex associations with plants, play important roles in promoting plant productivity and health in natural environments, and may be related to GTD development. To investigate associations between belowground fungal communities and GTD symptomatic or asymptomatic grapevines, fungal communities associated with three soil–plant compartments (bulk soils, rhizospheres, and roots) were characterized by ITS high-throughput amplicon sequencing across two years. Results: The fungal community diversity and composition differs according to the soil–plant compartment type (PERMANOVA, p < 0.001, 12.04% of variation explained) and sampling year (PERMANOVA, p < 0.001, 8.83%), whereas GTD symptomatology exhibited a weaker, but still significant association (PERMANOVA, p < 0.001, 1.29%). The effects of the latter were particularly prominent in root and rhizosphere community comparisons. Many GTD-associated pathogens were detected, but their relative abundances were not correlated (or were negatively correlated) to symptomatology. Fusarium spp., were enriched in symptomatic roots and rhizospheres compared to asymptomatic counterparts, suggesting that their abundances were positively correlated with symptomatic vines. Inoculation tests revealed that Fusarium isolates, similar to Dactylonectria macrodidyma, a pathogen associated with black foot disease, caused dark brown necrotic spots on stems in addition to root rot, which blackened lateral roots. Disease indices were higher with co-inoculation than single inoculation with a Fusarium isolate or D. macrodidyma, suggesting that Fusarium spp. can exacerbate disease severity when inoculated with other known GTD-associated pathogens. Conclusions: The belowground fungal microbiota of grapevines varied from soil–plant compartments, the years and whether showed GTD symptoms. The GTDs symptoms were related to the enrichment of Fusarium spp. rather than the relative abundances of GTD pathogens. These results demonstrate the effects of fungal microbiota of roots and rhizospheres on GTDs, while providing new insights into opportunistic pathogenesis of GTDs and potential control practices. © 2023, The Author(s).","Li Y.; Li X.; Zhang W.; Zhang J.; Wang H.; Peng J.; Wang X.; Yan J.",NA,"",NA,"Li, Yonghua (54410830900); Li, Xinghong (36062282100); Zhang, Wei (56306763200); Zhang, Jiao (59072219700); Wang, Hui (57218646585); Peng, Junbo (57216319371); Wang, Xuncheng (57205480557); Yan, Jiye (36648275000)",NA,"Belowground microbiota analysis indicates that Fusarium spp. exacerbate grapevine trunk disease","Environmental Microbiome",NA,NA,"English","Article",NA,"","","",NA,"Belowground; Fungi; Fusarium spp; Grapevine trunk diseases; Microbiota","agar gel electrophoresis; Article; blackfoot disease; comparative study; controlled study; Convolvulus arvensis; correlational study; disease severity; DNA denaturation; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; DNA template; endophytic fungus; foot disease; fungal community; fungal plant disease; fungus isolation; Fusarium; grapevine trunk disease; human impact (environment); lateral root; mycobiome; nonhuman; pathogenicity; phytopathogen; Portulaca oleracea; Pseudogymnoascus; rhizosphere fungus; symptomatology","Li Y., Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management on Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China, Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, 100097, China; Li X., Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management on Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China, Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, 100097, China; Zhang W., Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management on Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China, Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, 100097, China; Zhang J., Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management on Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China, Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, 100097, China, College of Plant Protection, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding, 071000, China; Wang H., Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management on Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China, Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, 100097, China; Peng J., Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management on Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China, Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, 100097, China; Wang X., Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management on Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China, Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, 100097, China; Yan J., Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management on Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China, Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, 100097, China","Beijing Key Laboratory of Environment Friendly Management on Fruit Diseases and Pests in North China, Institute of Plant Protection, Beijing Academy of Agriculture and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, 100097, China; College of Plant Protection, Hebei Agricultural University, Baoding, 071000, China","J.

"131","The development of endophyte inoculants for agricultural crops has been bedevilled by the twin problems of a lack of reliability and consistency, with a consequent lack of belief among end users in the efficacy of such treatments. We have developed a successful research pipeline for the production of a reliable, consistent and environmentally targeted fungal endophyte seed-delivered inoculant for barley cultivars. Our approach was developed de novo from an initial concept to source candidate endophyte inoculants from a wild relative of barley, Hordeum murinum (wall barley). A careful screening and selection procedure and extensive controlled environment testing of fungal endophyte strains, followed by multi-year field trials has resulted in the validation of an endophyte consortium suitable for barley crops grown on relatively dry sites. Our approach can be adapted for any crop or environment, provided that the set of first principles we have developed is followed.

"134","Leaf-mining insects produce conspicuous and distinct leaf mines on various types of plant leaves. The diversity of leaf-mine morphology has typically been explained by several factors, such as selective feeding on plant tissues, improvement of microclimate, faecal disposal, reduction in the efficiency of parasitoid search behaviour and leafminer phylogeny. Although these factors are certainly associated with mining patterns, masking the mines, rather than making them conspicuous, appears to be more advantageous for deterring parasitoids and predators of leafminers. However, here, I propose that prominent leaf mines may serve to signal or cue herbivores to avoid feeding on the mined leaves. Because most leafminers are sessile and complete their development within a single leaf, herbivory of mined leaves is detrimental to leafminer survival. Other herbivores appear to avoid consuming mined leaves for a variety of reasons: leaf mines mimic leaf variegation or mottling; mined leaves induce chemical and physical defences against herbivores; and leaf mines mimic fungal infection, animal excrement, and necrosed plant tissues. Hence, natural selection may have favoured leafminers that produce conspicuous mines because of the increased survival and fecundity of thereby reducing herbivory on mined leaves.","Yamazaki, K",NA,NA,NA,"Yamazaki, Kazuo",NA,"Leaf mines as visual defensive signals to herbivores","OIKOS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yamazaki, Kazuo/LGZ-7308-2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0030-1299","1600-0706",NA,NA,NA,"MAY",2010,119,"5",NA,NA,NA,"796","801",NA,"10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.18300.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2009.18300.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000276936000007",NA,4831,"Absence"
"135","Ecological restoration is the deliberate action that speeds recovery from a degraded system by direct or indirect human intervention. Xerophytic formations are among the most degraded ecosystems where low water availability makes reintroduction plans unsuccessful and extremely expensive. Roots inoculation with endophytic fungi has been reported as a successful strategy to maintain or improve the ecophysiological performance and survival in different species of shrubs and trees. In harsh environments, endophytes have been shown to provide benefits in terms of survival and growth for their associated vegetation. In this study, we showed that inoculation with endophytes isolated from plants growing in Antarctica improve survival and water use efficiency for irrigation on native species of xerophytic formations: Flourensia thurifera, Senna cumingii and Puya berteroniana. Overall, the presence of endophytes improved survival of all native species. Furthermore, the presence of endophytes improved water use efficiency for irrigation, reaching higher percentages of survival in plants with a reduction in the added water. The application of Antarctic endophytes could be considered a successful strategy for future projects and reintroduction programs in arid and semi-arid zones of Chile.","Fardella, C; Oses, R; Torres-Diaz, C; Molina-Montenegro, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Fardella, Cristian; Oses, Romulo; Torres-Diaz, Cristian; Molina-Montenegro, Marco A.",NA,"Antarctic fungal endophytes as tool for the reintroduction of native plant species in arid zones","BOSQUE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"OSES, ROMULO/AEB-0017-2022","Torres Diaz, Cristian/0000-0002-5741-5288; Molina-Montenegro, Marco/0000-0001-6801-8942",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0717-9200",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,2014,35,"2",NA,NA,NA,"235","239",NA,"10.4067/S0717-92002014000200011","http://dx.doi.org/10.4067/S0717-92002014000200011",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000340231600011",NA,2217,"Absence"
"136","Little is known about effects of salinity and flooding on plant symbionts, including baldcypress trees (Taxodium distichum), the dominant trees in many swamp ecosystems in the southeastern US. In this study, we characterize the culturable fungal and bacterial endophytes in the roots and leaves of baldcypress trees at four sites with varying levels of salinity and flooding regimes in southeastern Louisiana. Both salinity and flooding (water level) contributed to endophytic community composition of leaves and roots.

"137","Catharanthus roseus produces medicinally important terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) such as vindoline, vinblastine, and vincristine, but in very small amounts. The various microbial consortium consisting of plant growth-promoting and alkaloid enhancing endophytes were developed in order to enhance the overall productivity of such pharmaceutically important alkaloids. Furthermore, we attempted to identify the endophytic consortia suitable to maximally improve the content and yield of TIAs in field-grown C. roseus cultivars during the winter and summer seasons. The consortium, CATDLF5 + CATPS2 (Curvularia sp.+Bacillus pumilis), improves leaf weight in all C. roseus cultivars during winter and summer. On the alkaloids front, the consortium, CATDLF5 + CATPS2, maximally enhanced the vindoline content and yield in C. roseus cvs. Prabal and Nirmal during both winter and summer seasons; but different consortia were effective for improving vindoline content and yield in cv. Dhawal during different seasons. Whereas co-inoculation of CATDLF6 + CATPR13 (Choanephora infundibulifera + Paenibacillus sp.) and CATDLF5 + CATPS2 consortium maximally enhanced vindoline content and yield, respectively, in C. roseus cv. Dhawal during winter; but during summer, CATDLF6 + V3 (Choanephora infundibulifera + Micrococcus sp.) maximally increased both vindoline content and yield in C. roseus cv. Dhawal. The presence of vincristine and vinblastine are maximally detected in C. roseus plants during summer season. The consortium of CATDLF5 + CATPR13 (Curvularia sp. + Paenibacillus sp.) maximally enhanced the content as well as yield of vincristine and vinblastine in C. roseus cvs. Prabal and Nirmal plants, while CATDLF6 + CATPR13 inoculation showed maximal improvement in the content and yield of vinblastine and vincristine in C. roseus cv. Dhawal plants. This study identifies the best combination of endophytes that can maximize the plant growth and TIAs yield in various C. roseus plant cultivars under field conditions for both winter and summer seasons.","Singh, S; Pandey, SS; Tiwari, R; Pandey, A; Shanker, K; Kalra, A",NA,NA,NA,"Singh, Sucheta; Pandey, Shiv S.; Tiwari, Rashmi; Pandey, Alok; Shanker, Karuna; Kalra, Alok",NA,"Endophytic consortium with growth-promoting and alkaloid enhancing capabilities enhance key terpenoid indole alkaloids of Catharanthus roseus in the winter and summer seasons","INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PANDEY, ALOK/AAE-3921-2022; Pandey, Shiv Shanker/GSD-9059-2022; Shanker, Karuna/D-3596-2009","Pandey, Shiv Shanker/0000-0001-9730-2547; singh, sucheta/0000-0003-2470-2114; Pandey, Alok/0000-0001-5634-5911; Kalra, Alok/0000-0002-3314-0179",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0926-6690","1872-633X",NA,NA,NA,"AUG",2021,166,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.113437","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.113437",NA,"MAR 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000649653100006",NA,1642,"Absence"

"139","This study investigated fungal endophytes in the needles of Norway spruce (Picea abies) cuttings in relation to host tree growth. We also determined the prevalence of endophytes in needles incubated for six months. The cuttings originated from clonal origins showing slow- and fast-growth in long-term field trials but the heritable differences in growth rate were not yet detected among the studied cutting. Endophytes were isolated from surface-sterilized needles with culture-free DNA techniques. No significant differences were observed between endophyte communities of slow- and fast-growing clonal origins. However, the endophyte community correlated with the current growth rate of cuttings suggesting that endophytes reflect short- rather than long-term performance of a host. The concentration of condensed tannins was similar in slow- and fast-growing clonal origins but it showed a negative relationship with endophyte species richness, implying that these secondary compounds may play an important role in spruce tolerance against fungal infections. More than a third of endophyte species were detected in both fresh and decomposing needles, indicating that many needle endophytes are facultative saprotrophs. Several potentially pathogenic fungal species were also found within the community of saprotrophic endophytes. © 2014 The British Mycological Society.","Rajala T.; Velmala S.M.; Vesala R.; Smolander A.; Pennanen T.",NA,"",NA,"Rajala, Tiina (55041396000); Velmala, Sannakajsa M.

"140","Fungal endophytes of plants are ubiquitous and important to host plant health. Wood-inhabiting and foliar endophyte communities from multiple tree hosts were sampled at multiple spatial scales across the Fushan forest dynamics plot in northern Taiwan, using culture-free, community DNA amplicon sequencing methods. Fungal endophyte communities were distinct between leaves and wood, but the mycobiomes were highly variable across and within tree species. Despite this, host tree species was an important predictor of mycobiome community-composition. Within a single common tree species, ""core"" mycobiomes were characterized using co-occurrence analysis. The spatial co-occurrence patterns of these few species of fungal endophytes appear to explain the strong host effect. For wood endophytes, a consistent core mycobiome coexisted with the host across the extent of the study. For leaf endophytes, the core fungi resembled a more dynamic, ""gradient"" model of the core microbiome, changing across the topography and distance of the study.

"141","Fungal endophytes in container-grown seedlings in forest nurseries located in the North Plateau of Spain have been studied. Influences of nursery, season (spring and autumn), host genus and plant part on those fungal assemblages have been also evaluated. Four nurseries were sampled in spring and three in autumn. Analysed material consisted of stems, roots and rhizosphere from five host species, Quercus ilex, Q. pyrenaica, Pinus pinea, P. nigra and P. sylvestris. A total of 581 isolates corresponding to 13 taxa were found in this study. Fusarium moniliforme, F. oxysporum and Trichoderma viride were the most frequently isolated fungi. Number of fungal species per observation differed significantly among the sampled parts. Multivariate Correspondence Analysis allowed the discrimination of samples in five groups based on nursery, season, host genus and plant part. Isolation frequencies of F. moniliforme and F. oxysporum were higher in the roots and in spring, whereas those of T. viride were higher in the rhizosphere and in autumn. A relationship was observed between presence of T. viride and absence of Fusarium spp. in forest nurseries.

"142","Biotrophic fungal plant pathogens can balance their virulence and form intricate relationships with their hosts. Sometimes, this leads to systemic host colonization over long time scales without macroscopic symptoms. However, how plant-pathogenic endophytes manage to establish their sustained systemic infection remains largely unknown. Here, we present a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of Thecaphora thlaspeos. This relative of the well studied grass smut Ustilago maydis is the only smut fungus adapted to Brassicaceae hosts. Its ability to overwinter with perennial hosts and its systemic plant infection including roots are unique characteristics among smut fungi. The T. thlaspeos genome was assembled to the chromosome level. It is a typical smut genome in terms of size and genome characteristics. In silico prediction of candidate effector genes revealed common smut effector proteins and unique members. For three candidates, we have functionally demonstrated effector activity.

On the plant side, we found evidence for a typical immune response as it is present in other infection systems, despite the absence of any macroscopic symptoms during infection.

"143","The symbiotic association of Piriformospora indica provides growth promotion leading to increased biomass as well as enhanced plant tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses in a variety of plant species. Since various protein kinases are thought to be involved in mutual signaling in symbiotic interactions, we analyzed transcript profile of rice protein kinase genes during the infection process by real-time PCR. A rice L-type lectin protein kinase (OslecRK) and Arabidopsis AtLecRK genes are highly upregulated in roots during the initial stage of symbiotic association. In order to investigate the role of LecRK gene in root colonization, the Arabidopsis mutant line (Atlecrk) of rice homolog was used which shows the restricted intracellular penetration of the P. indica hyphae. The results indicate that LecRK might be a crucial factor in perception and recognition during plant-P. indica association by regulating fungal invasion.","Nivedita; Verma, PK; Upadhyaya, KC",NA,NA,NA,"Nivedita; Verma, Praveen K.; Upadhyaya, Kailash C.",NA,"Lectin Protein Kinase Is Induced in Plant Roots in Response to the Endophytic Fungus, <i>Piriformospora indica</i>","PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTER",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Nivedita, Nivedita/JQJ-5646-2023","lal, nivedita/0000-0003-4413-1128",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0735-9640","1572-9818",NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2017,35,"3",NA,NA,NA,"323","332",NA,"10.1007/s11105-017-1024-4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11105-017-1024-4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000402087600002",NA,8389,"Absence"

"145","In orchids, most of the root-associated fungal endophytes remain undescribed as well as the drivers that affect their interactions with the plants. We characterized root-associated fungal endophytes of coexisting orchids across sites in two areas of montane rainforest in the southern Ecuadorian Andes. We amplified the nrDNA ITS2 region of 130 orchid individuals with Illumina MiSeq technology and tested whether changes in the structure of fungal communities are associated with hosts' phylogeny or the sites where the orchids grow. We identified 3492 OTUs corresponding to the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Glomeromycota and Zygomycota phyla. Fungal communities associated with orchids at the lower geographic areas (between 2050 and 2800 m a.s.l.) showed that host evolution and sites are drivers that could shape distinct fungal communities, while at the highest geographic areas (between 3000 and 3500 m a.s.l.), no distinct fungal communities were found neither between co-existing orchid species nor between sites. These results suggested that among orchid species, abiotic and biotic factors do not influence the composition of fungal communities in the same way.

"146","The distribution of foliar fungal endophytes within and between needles and trees of Pinus strobus L. (white pine) is largely unknown. In this study, needles were collected in Muskoka, Ontario, plated, and scored for hyphal out-growth of endophytes to observe distributional patterns. Individual trees displayed different levels of infection but branches within those trees had similar levels. There was a large difference in the infection levels between the two extant needle age-classes, with the youngest needles being virtually endophyte-free. Needles divided into four sections exhibited the most hyphal outgrowth from the distal portion and the least from the medial-proximal portion. Cultural morphotypes were primarily of the Lophodermium and Hormonema morphologies. Lophodermium occurred at all positions along the needle but Hormonema was restricted to the proximal and distal portions. Infrequently occurring fungi of diverse morphotypes were found at all four needle positions. A separate experiment compared levels of endophyte infection between Muskoka trees and trees growing in an urban area (Guelph, Ontario). Needle pieces from Guelph hosts had low rates of infection (0.02%) compared with needle pieces from Muskoka hosts (66.5%). Thus, for white pine, foliar endophyte distribution is patchy within and between needles, trees, and locations, possibly reflecting differences in microhabitat or infection success.","Deckert R.J.; Peterson R.L.",NA,"",NA,"Deckert, R.J.

"147","The inselbergs of the Central Highlands of Madagascar are one of many 'micro-hotspots' of biodiversity on the island, particularly for Orchidaceae. In this region are several genera that have a large number of endemic species that are in serious decline or edging towards extinction. Studies relating to diversity of orchids and their fungal partners (both mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal root associates) deserve more attention, as climate change and human induced decline in resilience of species in the wild is at an all-time high. Identification of mycorrhizal fungi (MF) via conventional seed baited-protocorms has limitations for large scale studies and its application for time-bound conservation projects. The paper describes the value of understanding fungal diversity in the roots of orchids at different stages of maturity. The first part of the study was a preliminary investigation mainly to identify culturable Rhizoctonia endophytes, and the second part looked at all life forms of available taxa together with associated soil characteristics. We isolated and identified 19 putative MF from 18 of the 50 taxa spread over an area of 250 sq. km, covering three life forms, growth phases of the orchid taxa, and habitat types. In the rest of the taxa, we were unable to detect any putative MF, but had varying numbers of non-mycorrhizal endophytes. We also found that diversity of putative MF was higher in plants from soils with the lowest P levels recorded. Putative mycorrhizal OTUs were predominantly from the Tulasnella lineage, followed by Ceratobasidium and Serendipita. Within a small subset of samples, a difference in colonised endophytes depending on the collection season was observed. In vitro germination studies using 10 OTUs of mycorrhizal fungi in 14 orchid species showed mostly generalist associations. When orchid seed and fungal sources were studied irrespective of habitat, life form, and distance from each other (orchid seed and fungal source), compatibility for symbiotic seed germination was observed in most cases. Issues with the identification of compatible MF and symbiotic system of seed germination are discussed.","Yokoya, K; Zettler, LW; Bell, J; Kendon, JP; Jacob, AS; Schofield, E; Rajaovelona, L; Sarasan, V",NA,NA,NA,"Yokoya, Kazutomo; Zettler, Lawrence W.; Bell, Jake; Kendon, Jonathan P.; Jacob, Alison S.; Schofield, Emily; Rajaovelona, Landy; Sarasan, Viswambharan",NA,"The Diverse Assemblage of Fungal Endophytes from Orchids in Madagascar Linked to Abiotic Factors and Seasonality","DIVERSITY-BASEL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sarasan, Viswambharan/0000-0003-0297-9382; Zettler, Lawrence/0000-0002-1940-8132",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1424-2818",NA,NA,NA,"FEB",2021,13,"2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/d13020096","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d13020096",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000622445000001",NA,7902,"Both"

This work aims to characterise and quantify the AMF colonisation and to characterise septate endophytes present on the roots of the Thelypteridaceae: Amauropelta jujuyensis, A. nubicola, and Pelazoneuron patens. M&M: Ten individuals per species were collected in August 2022. Conventional staining and techniques were used to estimate colonisation. Results: The root of Amauropelta jujuyensis, A. nubicola, and Pelazoneuron patens showed AMF with Arum and Paris morphological types simultaneously. The hyphal colonization showed no significant difference among species, arbuscular colonization was significantly higher in A. jujuyensis, while vesicular colonization was considerably higher in A. nubicola. In addition, septate endophytes were evident in the species of the genus Amauropelta. Conclusion: The association of AMF and other fungal endophytes with the native Argentine Thelypteridaceae Amauropelta jujuyensis, A. nubicola, and Pelazoneuron patens is evidenced for the first time in riparian environments of the Yungas.

"149","The infection of grasses by systemic fungal parasites in the genus Epichloe was documented in six experimental grassland sites at Silwood Park, Berkshire, UK. The potential of insect herbivory acting as a selective agent favouring infection was investigated by comparing insecticide-treated and control plots within sites. The sites were established at different times from the colonization of bare ground and represented a range of grassland types occurring in close proximity. Five of 11 common grasses were occasionally infected by Epichloe. Holcus lanatus and H. mollis were the most frequent hosts and infection occurred primarily in the three oldest sites. Disease levels and host density were quantified by counting all healthy and diseased inflorescences in replicated one-m(2) plots at each site. Tn two of the sites where H. lanatus was the primary host disease levels were three times higher in insecticide-treated vs control plots. Holcus mollis was the primary host in the other site although visible manifestations of disease were rare. However, microscopic examinations revealed that 69% of all samples were asymptomatically infected and that infections were significantly less frequent in insecticide-treated plots. While insect herbivory appears to favour infected H. mollis, disease incidence in H. lanatus was highest in insecticide-treated plots.","Clay, K; Brown, VK",NA,NA,NA,"Clay, K; Brown, VK",NA,"Infection of Holcus lanatus and H-mollis by Epichloe in experimental grasslands","OIKOS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Clay, Keith/C-8730-2012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0030-1299",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JUN",1997,79,"2",NA,NA,NA,"363","370",NA,"10.2307/3546020","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3546020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1997WZ10300015",NA,7891,"Absence"

Mechanisms of response and resistance of two rice genotypes to As with or without phosphorus (P) nutrition and Serendipita indica (S. indica; S.i) colonization were explored by root transcriptome profiling in the present study. Results revealed that the resistant genotype had higher auxin content and root plasticity, which helped in keeping the As accumulation and P starvation response to a minimum under alone As stress. However, sufficient P supply and symbiotic relationship switched the energy resources towards plant's developmental aspects rather than excessive root proliferation. Higher As accumulating genotype (GD-6) displayed upregulation of ethylene signaling/biosynthesis, root stunting and senescence related genes under As toxicity. Antioxidant defense system and cytokinin biosynthesis/signaling of both genotypes were strengthened under As + S.i + P, while the upregulation of potassium (K) and zinc (Zn) transporters depicted underlying cross-talk with iron (Fe) and P. Differential expression of phosphate transporters, peroxidases and GSTs, metal detoxification/transport proteins, as well as phytohormonal metabolism were responsible for As detoxification. Taken together, S. indica symbiosis fortified with adequate P-fertilizer can prove to be effective in minimizing As acquisition and accumulation in rice plants.","Sehar, S; Adil, MF; Askri, SMH; Feng, QD; Wei, DM; Sahito, FS; Shamsi, IH",NA,NA,NA,"Sehar, Shafaque; Adil, Muhammad Faheem; Askri, Syed Muhammad Hassan; Feng, Qidong; Wei, Dongming; Sahito, Falak Sehar; Shamsi, Imran Haider",NA,"Pan-transcriptomic Profiling Demarcates <i>Serendipita Indica</i>-Phosphorus Mediated Tolerance Mechanisms in Rice Exposed to Arsenic Toxicity","RICE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wei, Dongming/AAB-4779-2020; Sehar, Shafaque/JZU-0844-2024; ASKRI, SYED MUHAMMAD HASSAN/ITU-6108-2023; Adil, Muhammad Faheem/AHE-2507-2022","Askri, Syed Muhammad Hassan/0000-0002-9104-8653; Sehar, Shafaque/0000-0003-4606-0175; Adil, Muhammad Faheem/0000-0001-5570-4433",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1939-8425","1939-8433",NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2023,16,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1186/s12284-023-00645-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12284-023-00645-0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37354226,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001016887800001",NA,4566,"Absence"

One species was detected in 33.1% of the cultures initiated in March, and another was present in 1.7% of cultures initiated in June. Based on analyses of phylogenetic and physiological characteristics these fungi were identified as Hormonema dematioides (isolated in March) and Rhodotorula minuta (isolated in June). Probes targeted towards the 18S rRNA of H. dematioides and R. minuta were made. When in situ hybridizations were performed on pine bud tissue, R. minuta was detected inside the cells of meristematic tissue in 40% of the samples, in contrast to H. dematioides, which was not found in this tissue. Using light microscopy, H. dematioides was found to be localized in the scale tissues of the buds. Fungal endophytes have previously been detected in scale tissues, but not in the meristematic tissues of buds.

The frequencies of Neotyphodium endophyte infection in Finland were investigated among and within seven Nordic cultivars of meadow fescue, Schedonorus pratensis (Huds.) P. Beauv., which is a widely grown pasture and forage grass species in Scandinavia. The cultivars were Kasper, Salten, Antti, Fure, Ilmari, Inkeri and Kalevi. Frequencies of infection of cultivars varied from endophyte-free cultivar Fure to highly infected cultivar Inkeri [mean (standard deviation of mean) of 0.95 (0.023)]. Mean frequencies of infection of three cultivars remained lower than 0.10, and two of the cultivars, Kasper and Salten, were intermediately infected. In most of the cultivars, frequencies of infection varied only slightly among seed lots. In cultivar Kasper, however, the frequency of endophyte infection was highly variable (0-0.96) among the 45 seed lots examined. The relative importance of cultivar, seed lot and infection by Neotyphodium endophyte to the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi L. was studied experimentally, using both endophyte-free and endophyte-infected plants of four seed lots of the two intermediately infected cultivars. Endophyte infection increased plant resistance to R. padi, overriding the influences of seed lot and cultivar.

"154","Gloriosa superba L. is of great economic importance due to its high medicinal value. Nevertheless, there is a need to reexamine species delimitation in the Gloriosa taxa as most of the species have been synonymised as G. superba. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate the vegetative anatomical traits of G. superba. The leaf, scale leaf, tendril, stem, tuber, and roots of G. superba were freehand sectioned and stained with various staining solutions to record the anatomical structures. The cellular dimensions of each plant part were measured. The present study revealed the presence of intercostal and costal regions in the leaf epidermis, anomocytic stomata on abaxial surface, uniseriate epidermis covered by cuticle, undifferentiated mesophyll, and a bundle sheath surrounding vascular bundles in a leaf. Unlike the leaf, the scale leaf contains air chambers in the mesophyll region and bundle sheath is absent. The tendril had uniseriate cuticularized epidermis followed by few layers of cells developing wall thickenings, and collateral vascular bundles. The mature stem is differentiated from the young stem by the presence of bi-layered epidermis, the absence of stomata on the stem surface, and chlorenchymatous hypodermis. Air passage containing epidermis covered by thin cuticle is recorded in the stem. Starch grains are present in the tuber ground tissue. Velamen is reported for the first time in G. superba root. Scalariform perforation end plate present in root metaxylem. Roots of G. superba are colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal and dark septate endophytic fungi.

"155","Epichloe endophytes are common symbionts living asymptomatically in pooid grasses and may provide chemical defences against herbivorous insects. While the mechanisms underlying these fungal defences have been well studied, it remains unknown whether endophyte presence affects the host's own defences. We addressed this issue by examining variation in the impact of Epichloe on constitutive and herbivore-induced emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC), a well-known indirect plant defence, between two grass species, Schedonorus phoenix (ex. Festuca arundinacea; tall fescue) and Festuca pratensis (meadow fescue). We found that feeding by a generalist aphid species, Rhopalosiphum padi, induced VOC emissions by uninfected plants of both grass species but to varying extents, while mechanical wounding failed to do so in both species after one day of damage. Interestingly, regardless of damage treatment, Epichloe uncinata-infected F. pratensis emitted significantly lower quantities of VOCs than their uninfected counterparts. In contrast, Epichloe coenophiala-infected S. phoenix did not differ from their uninfected counterparts in constitutive VOC emissions but tended to increase VOC emissions under intense aphid feeding. A multivariate analysis showed that endophyte status imposed stronger differences in VOC profiles of F. pratensis than damage treatment, while the reverse was true for S. phoenix. Additionally, both endophytes inhibited R. padi population growth as measured by aphid dry biomass, with the inhibition appearing greater in E. uncinata-infected F. pratensis. Our results suggest, not only that Epichloe endophytes may play important roles in mediating host VOC responses to herbivory, but also that the magnitude and direction of such responses may vary with the identity of the Epichloe-grass symbiosis. Whether Epichloe-mediated host VOC responses will eventually translate into effects on higher trophic levels merits future investigation.","Li, T; Blande, JD; Gundel, PE; Helander, M; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Li, Tao; Blande, James D.; Gundel, Pedro E.; Helander, Marjo; Saikkonen, Kari",NA,"<i>Epichloe</i> Endophytes Alter Inducible Indirect Defences in Host Grasses","PLOS ONE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Blande, James/Q-9611-2019","Saikkonen, Kari/0000-0001-5203-9984; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Helander, Marjo/0000-0002-9759-4321; Blande, James/0000-0001-6822-0649; Li, Tao/0000-0003-1462-5135",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1932-6203",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JUN 30",2014,9,"6",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0101331","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0101331",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24978701,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000338506400118",NA,3185,"Both"
"156","Fungal endophytes that colonize forest trees are widespread, but they are less well known than endophytes infecting grasses. The few studies on endophytes in trees mainly concern the tropical areas and the northernmost latitudes, while similar investigations in the Mediterranean region have so far been scarce and incidental. Endophytes are studied mostly in economically important forests suffering from diseases, such as oak forests. One common endophyte that has received some study on oak is the mitosporic Discula quercina. This paper, after first addressing some basic problems on tree endophytes, examines the ecology of D. quercina in Mediterranean oak stands. D. quercina is usually viewed as a symptomless colonizer of healthy Quercus cerris. infecting new leaves early in the growing season, in an unstable equilibrium between transient mutualism/neutralism and latent pathogenesis. It is postulated here that climatic factors can change the endophytic nature of D. quercina, turning it into a weak pathogen or an opportunistic invader of senescing and indeed healthy trees. It is argued more generally that stochastic events can cause the lifestyle of an endophyte to switch from beneficial/neutral to pathogenic, transforming the tree-endophyte interaction, an interaction that depends in part on the matching genomes of the tree and endophyte, and on the environmental context.","Moricca, S; Ragazzi, A",NA,NA,NA,"Moricca, S.; Ragazzi, A.",NA,"Fungal endophytes in Mediterranean oak forests:: A lesson from <i>Discula quercina</i>","PHYTOPATHOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"moricca, salvatore/0000-0003-3097-559X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0031-949X","1943-7684",NA,NA,NA,"APR",2008,98,"4",NA,NA,NA,"380","386",NA,"10.1094/PHYTO-98-4-0380","http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO-98-4-0380",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18944185,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000254310500002",NA,3788,"Absence"
"157","Almost all living plants can be simultaneously colonised by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the roots and endophytes in the shoots, while also being attacked by insect herbivores. However, to date, no study has ever examined the multitrophic interactions between these two different fungal groups and insects on any species of forb. Here, we examined the effects of two commercial species mixtures of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and two foliar endophytes (Colletotrichum acutatum and Cladosporium oxysporum) on the growth of an invasive weed, Impatiens glandulifera, and the aphids that attack it. AMF reduced plant biomass, which was most evident when C. oxysporum was inoculated. Mycorrhizal fungi had few effects on aphids, and these depended on the identity of the endophytes present. Meanwhile, endophytes tended to increase aphid numbers, but this depended on the identity of the AMF inoculum. Throughout, there were differences in the responses of the plant to the two mycorrhizal mixtures, demonstrating clear AMF specificity in this plant. These specific effects were also strongly affected by the endophytes, with a greater number of interactions found between the AMF and endophytes than between the endophytes themselves. In particular, AMF reduced infection levels by the endophytes, while some endophyte inoculations reduced mycorrhizal colonisation. We suggest that both AMF and endophytes could play an important part in future biological control programmes of weeds, but further multitrophic experiments are required to unravel the complexity of interactions between spatially separated parts of the plant microbiome.","Ab Razak, N; Gange, AC",NA,NA,NA,"Ab Razak, Nadia; Gange, Alan C.",NA,"Multitrophic Interactions Between Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi, Foliar Endophytic Fungi and Aphids","MICROBIAL ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ab Razak, Nadia/0000-0002-2278-3128",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0095-3628","1432-184X",NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2023,85,"1",NA,NA,NA,"146","156",NA,"10.1007/s00248-021-01937-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-021-01937-y",NA,"DEC 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,34904179,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000729696400001",NA,647,"Both"

Here, we apply a novel extension of this framework to microbiota associated with aboveground tissues, termed 'plant-phyllosphere feedback (PPFs)'. In parallel greenhouse experiments, rhizosphere and phyllosphere microbiota of con-and heterospecific hosts from four species were independently manipulated. In a third experiment, we tested the combined effects of soil and phyllosphere feedback under field conditions. We found that three of four species experienced weak negative PSF whereas, in contrast, all four species experienced strong negative PPFs. Field-based feedback estimates were highly negative for all four species, though variable in magnitude. Our results suggest that phyllosphere microbiota, like rhizosphere microbiota, can potentially mediate plant species coexistence via negative feedbacks. Extension of the PSF framework to the phyllosphere is needed to more fully elucidate plant-microbiota interactions.","Whitaker, BK; Bauer, JT; Bever, JD; Clay, K",NA,NA,NA,"Whitaker, Briana K.; Bauer, Jonathan T.; Bever, James D.; Clay, Keith",NA,"Negative plant-phyllosphere feedbacks in native Asteraceae hosts - a novel extension of the plant-soil feedback framework","ECOLOGY LETTERS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Whitaker, Briana/AGH-6130-2022; Bauer, Jonathan/ABE-1323-2021","Whitaker, Briana/0000-0003-2522-9672",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1461-023X","1461-0248",NA,NA,NA,"AUG",2017,20,"8",NA,NA,NA,"1064","1073",NA,"10.1111/ele.12805","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ele.12805",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28677329,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000405917500014",NA,5679,"Both"
"159","Many cool-season grasses have symbiotic relationships with Epichloe (Ascomycota, Clavicipitaceae) fungal endophytes that inhabit the intercellular spaces of the above-ground parts of the host plants. The presence of the Epichloe endophytes is generally beneficial to the hosts due to enhanced tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses conferred by the endophytes. Many Epichloe spp. are asexual, and those infections always remain asymptomatic. However, some Epichloe spp. have a sexual stage and produce a macroscopic fruiting body, a stroma, that envelops the developing inflorescence causing a syndrome termed ""choke disease"". Here, we report a fungal and plant gene expression analysis of choke stroma tissue and asymptomatic inflorescence tissue of Epichloefestucae-infected strong creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra subsp. rubra). Hundreds of fungal genes and over 10% of the plant genes were differentially expressed when comparing the two tissue types. The differentially expressed fungal genes in the choke stroma tissue indicated a change in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, as well as a change in expression of numerous genes for candidate effector proteins. Plant stress-related genes were up-regulated in the stroma tissue, suggesting the plant host was responding to the epiphytic stage of E. festucae as a pathogen.","Wang, RY; Clarke, BB; Belanger, FC",NA,NA,NA,"Wang, Ruying; Clarke, Bruce B.; Belanger, Faith C.",NA,"Transcriptome Analysis of Choke Stroma and Asymptomatic Inflorescence Tissues Reveals Changes in Gene Expression in Both <i>Epichloe</i> <i>festucae</i> and Its Host Plant <i>Festuca rubra</i> subsp. <i>rubra</i>","MICROORGANISMS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wang, Ruying/JPX-5493-2023","Wang, Ruying/0000-0002-8071-6919; Belanger, Faith/0000-0002-8725-0824",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2076-2607",NA,NA,NA,"NOV",2019,7,"11",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/microorganisms7110567","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms7110567",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31744076,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000502273600090",NA,4987,"Absence"

We used mutants impaired in ER bodies (nai1), ER body-resident myrosinases (pyk10bglu21), IG biosynthesis (myb34/51/122), and Trp specialized metabolism (cyp79b2b3) to profile their root microbiota community in natural soil, evaluate the impact of axenically collected root exudates on soil or synthetic microbial communities, and test their response to fungal endophytes in a mono-association setup. Tested mutants exhibited altered bacterial and fungal communities in rhizoplane and endosphere, respectively. Natural soils and bacterial synthetic communities treated with mutant root exudates exhibited distinctive microbial profiles from those treated with wild-type (WT) exudates. Most tested endophytes severely restricted the growth of cyp79b2b3, a part of which also impaired the growth of pyk10bglu21.

"161","Premise: Endophytic and mycorrhizal fungi are crucial in facilitating plant nutrition acquisition and stress tolerance. In epiphytic habitats, plants face nutrition and water stress, but their roots are mostly nonmycorrhizal and especially lacking in arbuscular mycorrhizal associations. Ophioderma pendulum is an epiphytic fern with a partially mycoheterotrophic lifestyle, likely heavily reliant on symbiotic fungi. To characterize fungal associations in the sporophyte of O. pendulum, we focused on leaves and roots of O. pendulum, seeking to reveal the fungal communities in these organs. Methods: Roots and leaves from O. pendulum in a subtropical forest were examined microscopically to observe the morphology of fungal structures and determine the percentage of various fungal structures in host tissues. Fungal composition was profiled using metabarcoding techniques that targeted ITS2 of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. Results: Roots were consistently colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Glomeromycota), especially Acaulospora. Unlike previous findings on epiphytic ferns, dark septate endophytes were rare in O. pendulum roots. Leaves were predominantly colonized by Ascomycota fungi, specifically the classes Dothideomycetes (46.88%), Eurotiomycetes (11.51%), Sordariomycetes (6.23%), and Leotiomycetes (6.14%). Across sampling sites, fungal community compositions were similar in the roots but differed significantly in the leaves. Conclusions: Ophioderma pendulum maintains stable, single-taxon-dominant communities in the roots, primarily featuring arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, whereas the leaves may harbor opportunistic fungal colonizers. Our study underlines the significance of mycorrhizal fungi in the adaptation of epiphytic ferns.","Xie, QY; Kuo, LY; Chang, CC; Lin, CJ; Wang, WH; Chen, KH",NA,NA,NA,"Xie, Qiao-Yi; Kuo, Li-Yaung; Chang, Chiung-Chih; Lin, Chien-Jung; Wang, Wen-Hong; Chen, Ko-Hsuan",NA,"Prevalent arbuscular mycorrhizae in roots and highly variable mycobiome in leaves of epiphytic subtropical fern <i>Ophioderma pendulum</i>","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Chen, Ko-Hsuan/HLQ-6649-2023","Chen, Ko-Hsuan/0000-0001-9099-9054; Wang, Wen Hong/0000-0002-1352-3260",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0002-9122","1537-2197",NA,NA,NA,"2024 APR 20",2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1002/ajb2.16319","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajb2.16319",NA,"APR 2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,38641926,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001205736600001",NA,6330,"Absence"
"162","The symbiosis between cool-season grasses and fungi of the genus Epichloe is widespread, but highly variable in natural ecosystems. Biotic and abiotic controls underlying its distribution patterns have been difficult to establish, but might be related to a greater capacity of infected plants to deal with drought and herbivory. In this study we examined the relationship between grazing intensity and symbiosis frequency in plant species differentially preferred by herbivores. In all the grass species found in the studied Patagonian steppe, we determined the infection frequency along a grazing gradient by sheep (ungrazed, moderate- and intense-grazing). Three out of five preferred species and one out of four non-preferred species presented the symbiosis. Within the group of species having the symbiosis, intense grazing decreased the infection frequency of the preferred species while the frequency of the non-preferred species remained constant. These changes of infection frequency were correlated with changes in tiller biomass of hosts suggesting that symbiosis frequency could depend on overall plant performance. Our results suggest that high grazing intensity could weaken the relationship between these endophytes and their palatable hosts, eventually making them even more vulnerable to further grazing.

"163","This paper reports the use of molecular methods to characterize the coprophilous fungal communities (CFC) that inhabit the dung of four species of mammalian herbivores at two sites, Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR) in New Mexico and Wind Cave National Park (WCNP) in South Dakota. Results reveal that CFC from domesticated cattle (Bos taurus) at SNWR, and bison (Bison bison) and black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) at WCNP were diverse but dominated primarily by members within eight taxonomic orders, including the rarely cultured and anaerobic order Neocallimastigales. In addition, 7.7% (138 of 1,788) of the sequences obtained from all dung samples were at least 97% similar to root-associated fungal (RAF) sequences previously described from blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), a common forage grass found throughout North America and growing at both study sites. In contrast, 95.8% (295 of 308) of the sequences and four of the total seven operational taxonomic units obtained from pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) dung belonged to the Pleosporalean order. We hypothesize that some herbivore vectors disperse non-systemic (non-clavicipitaceous) fungal endophytes. These dispersal events, it is argued, are most likely to occur via herbivores that occasionally forage and masticate root tissue, especially in arid regions where aboveground vegetation is sparse. The results of this study suggest that some (possibly many) members of the RAF community can expand their ecological role to include colonizing dung. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Herrera J.; Poudel R.; Khidir H.H.",NA,"",NA,"Herrera, José (7201650153); Poudel, Ravin (38461528100); Khidir, Hana H.

"164","Background While a considerable amount of research has explored plant community composition in primary successional systems, little is known about the microbial communities inhabiting these pioneer plant species. Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous within plants, and may play major roles in early successional ecosystems. Specifically, endophytes have been shown to affect successional processes, as well as alter host stress tolerance and litter decomposition dynamics-both of which are important components in harsh environments where soil organic matter is still scarce. Results To determine possible contributions of fungal endophytes to plant colonization patterns, we surveyed six of the most common woody species on the Pumice Plain of Mount St. Helens (WA, USA; Lawetlat'la in the Cowlitz language; created during the 1980 eruption)-a model primary successional ecosystem-and found low colonization rates (< 15%), low species richness, and low diversity. Furthermore, while endophyte community composition did differ among woody species, we found only marginal evidence of temporal changes in community composition over a single field season (July-September). Conclusions Our results indicate that even after a post-eruption period of 40 years, foliar endophyte communities still seem to be in the early stages of community development, and that the dominant pioneer riparian species Sitka alder (Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata) and Sitka willow (Salix sitchensis) may be serving as important microbial reservoirs for incoming plant colonizers.","Wolfe, ER; Dove, R; Webster, C; Ballhorn, DJ",NA,NA,NA,"Wolfe, Emily R.; Dove, Robyn; Webster, Cassandra; Ballhorn, Daniel J.",NA,"Culturable fungal endophyte communities of primary successional plants on Mount St. Helens, WA, USA","BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wolfe, Emily/0000-0003-1808-7012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2730-7182",NA,NA,NA,"FEB 15",2022,22,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1186/s12862-022-01974-2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12862-022-01974-2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35168544,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000755858200001",NA,1124,"Both"

"166","Plant-fungi interactions have been identified as fundamental drivers of the plant host performance, particularly in cold environments where organic matter degradation rates are slow, precisely for the capacity of the fungal symbiont to enhance the availability of labile nitrogen (N) in the plant rhizosphere. Nevertheless, these positive effects appear to be modulated by the composition and amount of the N pool in the soil, being greater when plant hosts are growing where N is scarce as is the case of Antarctic soils. Nevertheless, in some coastal areas of this continent, seabirds and marine mammal colonies exert, through their accumulated feces and urine a strong influence on the edaphic N content surrounding their aggregation points. To evaluate if the fungal symbionts (root endophytes), associated to the only two Antarctic vascular plants Colobanthus quitensis and Deschampsia antarctica, act as N-uptake enhancers, even in such N-rich conditions as those found around animal influence, we assessed, under controlled conditions, the process of N mineralization in soil by the accumulation of NH4+ in the rizhosphere and the biomass accumulation of plants with (E+) and without (E-) fungal symbionts. Complementarily, taking advantage of the isotopic N-fractionation that root-fungal symbionts exert on organic N molecules during its acquisition process, we also determined if endophytes actively participate in the Antarctic plants N-uptake, when inorganic N is not a limiting factor, by estimating the delta N-15 isotopic signatures in leaves. Overall, symbiotic interaction increased the availability of NH4+ in the rhizosphere of both species. As expected, the enhanced availability of inorganic N resulted in a higher final biomass in E + compared with E- plants of both species. In addition, we found that the positive role of fungal symbionts was also actively linked to the process of N-uptake in both species, evidenced by the contrasting delta N-15 signatures present in E+ (-0.4 to -2.3 parts per thousand) relative to E- plants (2.7-3.1 parts per thousand). In conclusion, despite being grown under rich N soils, the two Antarctic vascular plants showed that the presence of root-fungal endophytes, furthermore enhanced the availability of inorganic N sources in the rhizosphere, has a positive impact in their biomass, remarking the active participation of these endophytes in the N-uptake process for plants inhabiting the Antarctic continent.","Acuña-Rodríguez, IS; Galán, A; Torres-Díaz, C; Atala, C; Molina-Montenegro, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Acuna-Rodriguez, Ian S.; Galan, Alexander; Torres-Diaz, Cristian; Atala, Cristian; Molina-Montenegro, Marco A.",NA,"Fungal Symbionts Enhance N-Uptake for Antarctic Plants Even in Non-N Limited Soils","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Galán, Alexander/KHD-9979-2024","Atala, Cristian/0000-0003-1337-9534; Torres Diaz, Cristian/0000-0002-5741-5288; Galan, Alexander/0000-0001-8775-0426",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-302X",NA,NA,NA,"OCT 23",2020,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2020.575563","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.575563",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33193189,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000585961800001",NA,6134,"Both"
"167","Epichloe spp. are symbiotic fungal endophytes of many cool season grasses. The presence of the fungal endophytes often confers insect, drought, and disease tolerance to the host grasses. The presence of the fungal endophytes within the host plants does not elicit host defense responses. The molecular basis for this phenomenon is not known. Epichloe festucae, the endophyte of Festuca rubra, expresses a salicylate hydroxylase similar to NahG from the bacterium Pseudomonas putida. Few fungal salicylate hydroxylase enzymes have been reported. The in planta expression of an endophyte salicylate hydroxylase raised the possibility that degradation of plant-produced salicylic acid is a factor in the mechanism of how the endophyte avoids eliciting host plant defenses. Here we report the characterization of the E. festucae salicylate hydroxylase, designated Efe-shyA. Although the fungal enzyme has the expected activity, based on salicylic acid levels in endophyte-free and endophyte-infected plants it is unlikely that expression of the endophyte salicylate hydroxylase is a factor in the lack of a host defense response to the presence of the fungal endophyte.","Ambrose, KV; Tian, ZP; Wang, YF; Smith, J; Zylstra, G; Huang, BR; Belanger, FC",NA,NA,NA,"Ambrose, Karen V.; Tian, Zipeng; Wang, Yifei; Smith, Jordan; Zylstra, Gerben; Huang, Bingru; Belanger, Faith C.",NA,"Functional characterization of salicylate hydroxylase from the fungal endophyte <i>Epichloe festucae</i>","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wang, Yifei/M-9923-2015","Zylstra, Gerben/0000-0003-0419-1353",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2045-2322",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JUN 9",2015,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1038/srep10939","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep10939",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,26055188,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000356082000001",NA,3215,"Absence"
"168","Plants simultaneously associate with multiple microbial symbionts throughout their lifetimes. To address the question of whether the effects of simultaneous symbionts are contingent on the specific identities, we conducted a greenhouse experiment manipulating the presence and identities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and fungal endophytes on the shared host grass Elymus hystrix. Each plant host was inoculated with one of two AMF species having varying effects on host growth, or a sterile soil control. Further, we used naturally occurring endophyte-infected (E+) and uninfected (E) individuals from two populations of the endophyte Epichloe elymi that varied in their interaction with E. hystrix. We then measured responses of plants, AMF, and fungal endophytes. Overall, we found that the combined effects of AMF and fungal endophytes on plant growth were additive, reflecting the mutualistic quality of each symbiont independently interacting with host plants. However, fungal endophyte infection differentially altered hyphal colonization of the two AMF species and the identity of the coinfecting AMF species affected fungal endophyte fitness traits. The results of this study demonstrate that the outcome of interspecific symbiotic interactions varies with partner identity such that the effects of simultaneous symbioses can not be generalized.","Larimer, AL; Bever, JD; Clay, K",NA,NA,NA,"Larimer, Anna L.; Bever, James D.; Clay, Keith",NA,"Consequences of simultaneous interactions of fungal endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi with a shared host grass","OIKOS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Clay, Keith/C-8730-2012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0030-1299",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2012,121,"12",NA,NA,NA,"2090","2096",NA,"10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.20153.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0706.2012.20153.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000311390500019",NA,6255,"Both"
"169","The development rate, survival and pupal weight of the armyworms Mythimna convecta and Persectania ewingii were compared after the larvae were reared on seedling or mature vegetative forms of wheat, oats and barley. No larvae of P. ewingii survived on oat seedlings, and on mature oats survival and growth rates were significantly lower than on other cereals. P. ewingii growth rates were also lower on the seedling form of barley than that of wheat. Immature development rates of M. convecta were unaffected by cereal species, although pupae grown from oats were significantly heavier. M. convecta was also tested on a number of pasture grasses. The species had maximum growth rates on barley grass (Hordeum leporinum), performed well on rye grass (Lolium perenne) (with and without the fungal endophyte Acremonium lolii) and kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum), and had significantly slower growth rates on paspalum (Paspalum dilatum) and Mitchell grass (Astrebla pectinata).

"170","Infection with Neotyphodium spp. endophytes increases resistance to drought stress and soil mineral imbalances in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. = Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) S. J. Darbysh.) and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds. = Lolium pratense (Huds.) Darbysh.). We hypothesized that resistance of these grasses to salinity stress may also be attributed to endophyte infection. Two tall fescue genotypes, Fa75 and Fa83, and one meadow fescue genotype, Fp60, infected (E+) with their endophytic fungi, Neotyphodium coenophialum (Glenn, Bacon and Hanlin) and N. uncinatum (Glenn, Bacon and Hanlin), respectively, and their noninfected counterparts (E-) were cultured in nutrient solution at three salinity levels of 0, 85, and 170 mM NaCl. Except for genotype Fa75, E+ plants exhibited higher leaf survival rates than E-clones at a high salinity level (170 mM). Root dry matter was higher in E+ than in E-plants, but shoot dry matter was not affected by endophyte infection. This resulted in a lower shoot-to-root ratio in E+ plants (1.63) compared with E-plants (2.40). Sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) concentrations were greater in roots of E-than in E+ clones. In shoots, Na+ and Cl- concentrations were not affected by the endophyte. In contrast, E+ plants accumulated more potassium (K+), which resulted in a greater K+ : Na+ ratio in shoots of E+ than in those of E-plants. Our results show that endophyte infection reduced Na+ and Cl- concentrations in tall fescue and meadow fescue roots but increased K+ concentrations in the shoots. Based on these results, we conclude that endophyte-infected grasses may thrive better in salinity-stress environments.","Sabzalian, MR; Mirlohi, A",NA,NA,NA,"Sabzalian, Mohammad Reza; Mirlohi, Aghafakhr",NA,"<i>Neotyphodium</i> endophytes trigger salt resistance in tall and meadow fescues","JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sabzalian, Mohammad R./E-6279-2013","Sabzalian, Mohammad R./0000-0002-7315-9990",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1436-8730","1522-2624",NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2010,173,"6",NA,NA,NA,"952","957",NA,"10.1002/jpln.200900345","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jpln.200900345",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000285313700019",NA,4603,"Both"
"171","Seed endophytes, as primary symbionts, may influence formation of secondary symbioses in maturing hosts. We hypothesize that such priority effects are a function of the presence and the identity of the primary symbiont, and are simulated via inoculation with primary symbionts. We sampled primary symbionts in winter wheat using culture-based techniques and next generation sequencing. Ninety-one percent of 6300 seeds had either one or no isolates. NGS data supported this with over 99% fewer reads detected in seeds having no isolates. Alternaria and Cladosporium spp., accounted for almost 80% of the primary symbionts isolated from seeds but only 36% of OTUs. Bacteria accounted for 13% of isolates but 27% of OTUs. We grew seedlings with or without primary symbiont isolates aseptically in vitro with roots in contact with a suspension of the rhizosphere symbiont Phialocephala fortinii. Seedlings having Cladosporium spp. or bacteria as primary symbionts increased the P. fortinii root colonization in 3 weeks by 30% and 50%, respectively, compared to seedlings lacking symbionts. Alternaria primary symbionts had no effect on root colonization by P. fortinii. However, Cladosporium and Alternaria inocula reduced P. fortinii colonization by 75% and 42%, respectively, at 3 weeks, so natural priority effects were not simulated by inoculation with fungi. Bacillus inoculum doubled P. fortinii colonization, but colonization was delayed. Primary symbionts of wheat seed can have strong, natural priority effects dependent on their presence and identity, but inoculation does not always simulate natural effects.","Ridout, ME; Schroeder, KL; Hunter, SS; Styer, J; Newcombe, G",NA,NA,NA,"Ridout, Mary E.; Schroeder, Kurtis L.; Hunter, Samuel S.; Styer, James; Newcombe, George",NA,"Priority effects of wheat seed endophytes on a rhizosphere symbiosis","SYMBIOSIS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"JUL 15-20, 2018","Oregon State Univ, Corvallis, OR","Symbiosis Soc","Oregon State Univ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Schroeder, Kurtis/0000-0001-7867-4556",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0334-5114","1878-7665",NA,NA,NA,"MAY",2019,78,"1",NA,"SI",NA,"19","31",NA,"10.1007/s13199-019-00606-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-019-00606-6",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000469424800003",NA,6655,"Absence"
"172","A traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) root extract known as Yuanzhi has recently garnered extensive attention because of its ability to improve cognitive function and memory. We attempted to advance understanding of the complex biological processes that accompany the harvest and post-harvest processing of this chemically and anatomically unique material. Here, we report changes in the fungal microbiota during the processing of Polygala tenuifolia roots, as determined by high-throughput sequencing. Our results showed that compacting the roots in airtight polyethylene bags prior to the heart removal process, which is undertaken to facilitate the heart-removal process, did not alter the fungal operational taxonomic unit (OTU) abundance or composition significantly. Once the heart of the P. tenuifolia roots was discarded, the OTU counts decreased for many fungal taxa, such as endophytes, while the Penicillium increased markedly. These results can help inform provide practical guidelines for improving the storage and processing protocols used by both P. tenuifolia producers and by the TCM apothecaries who prepare and prescribe Yuanzhi.","He, L; Bai, L; Shan, LN; Yu, PH; Zhang, L; Dou, XW; Yang, MH",NA,NA,NA,"He, Liu; Bai, Ling; Shan, Linan; Yu, Penghao; Zhang, Lei; Dou, Xiaowen; Yang, Meihua",NA,"Variations in fungal microbiota and aflatoxin contamination during the processing of Yuanzhi, a traditional Chinese medicine","INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"He, Liu/GLS-1874-2022","He, Liu/0000-0003-3951-4132",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0926-6690","1872-633X",NA,NA,NA,"SEP 15",2020,152,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.112509","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.112509",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000538118500024",NA,410,"Absence"

"174","Aquatic hyphomycetes play a key role in leaf litter decomposition and are mediators of organic matter turnover in streams. Molecular studies have shown that some aquatic fungi are also plant endophytes, however, more evidence is needed to evaluate their multiple ecological abilities. To date, little information is available on fungal lineages that might have undergone convergent evolution to adapt to multiple ecological modes. We examined the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary divergences of aquatic hyphomycetes, endophytic aquatic hyphomycetes and other fungal endophytes of riparian/terrestrial plants by analyzing ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequences retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Sequences with close phylogenetic affinity to aquatic fungi can occur as endophytes of terrestrial plants or in soil far from streams. To fully understand the ecological impact of aquatic hyphomycetes, we need to document and interpret their niches more broadly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

"175","Previous studies conducted in growth chambers had demonstrated the successful experimental inoculation of white spruce seedlings with anti-insectan toxin producing needle endophytes. Needles colonized with the rugulosin-producing endophyte 5WS22E1 (DAOM 229536) contained rugulosin in concentrations that impaired spruce budworm growth. Here we report experimental inoculations conducted under nursery conditions. To improve the reliability of detecting successful colonization, a polyclonal assay was developed for the target endophyte 5WS22E1. It was able to reliably detect the fungus in 500 ng subsamples of colonized needles. Seventeen months post-inoculation, 330 seedlings from 1235 inoculated were colonized. A random selection of 113 colonized seedlings was analyzed for rugulosin. Needles of most (90%) contained detectable concentrations of rugulosin. The range and distribution of the rugulosin concentrations was similar to that found in earlier tests done in growth chambers. © 2005 by The Mycological Society of America.","Sumarah M.W.; Miller J.D.; Adams G.W.",NA,"",NA,"Sumarah, Mark W.

NCI endophytic fungi were also found in three subspecies of F. rubra, namely, strong creeping red, slender creeping red, and Chewings fescue and in hard fescues.

"177","AimsPlants, fungal endophytes (FEs) and the changing environment interact with each other forming an interlaced network. This study evaluates nonadditive and interactive effects of the FE Acremonium strictum and drought treatment on Atractylodes lancea plantlets. Methods and ResultsBy applying FEs (meristem cultures of At.lancea, fungal inoculation of Ac.strictum and plantlet acclimatization) and drought treatment (regular watering, mild drought, severe drought), a research system of At.lancea ramets under different treatments was established. During 12days of drought treatment, the plantlets' physiological responses and basic growth traits were measured and analysed. Although drought and FE presence affected plantlet traits to differing degrees, the interactive effects of the two were more pronounced. In particular under mild drought treatment, the FE conferred drought tolerance to plantlets by enhancing leaf soluble sugars, proteins, proline and antioxidant enzyme activity; decreasing the degree of plasmalemma oxidation; and increasing the host's abscisic acid level and root:shoot ratio. When exposed to regular watering or severe drought, these effects were not significant. ConclusionsPlant traits plasticity was conferred by dual effects of drought stress and FEs, and these factors are interactive. Although FEs can help plants cope with drought stress, the beneficial effects are strictly constrained by drought degree. Significance and Impact of the StudyDuring finite environmental stress, FEs can benefit plants, and for this reason, they may alleviate the effects of climate change on plants. However, because the benefits of FEs are highly context dependent, the role of FEs in a changing background should be re-assessed.","Yang, T; Ma, S; Dai, CC",NA,NA,NA,"Yang, T.; Ma, S.; Dai, C.

Metabarcoding of DNA extracted from root samples of both species following surface sterilization, and others without surface sterilization was used to determine if there were shared fungal endophytes in the roots of both species that could form a common mycorrhizal network between them. A wide variety of fungi were recovered from primers amplifying the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS2). Sixty-six fungal sequences were shared by surface-sterilized roots of both orchid and ash, among them arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (Claroideoglomus, Dominikia, Glomus and Rhizophagus), ectomycorrhizal fungi (Inocybe and Tomentella), the broad-host root endophyte Cadophora orchidicola, along with root pathogens (Dactylonectria, Ilyonectria, Pyricularia, and Xylomyces) and fungi of unknown function.

Using molecular identification, we document an ecologically and phylogenetically diverse array of fungi associated with the living parts of three widespread and abundant boreal forest bryophytes, i.e., Hylocomium splendens (Hedw.) Schimp. in B.S.G., Pleurozium schreberi (Brid.) Mitt., and Polytrichum commune Hedw. From 376 cloned ITS sequences, 158 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), roughly corresponding to the number of species, were defined based on sequence similarity searches (Fasta) and phylogenetic analyses. A main portion (62.8%) of the OTUs belonged to Ascomycota, 32.0% to Basidiomycota, 3.9% to Chytridiomycota, and 1.3% to Glomeromycota. The most common orders were Helotiales (18.6%), Agaricales (11.5%), Chaetothyriales (9.6%), and Tremellales (9.0%). Frequently detected OTUs of potentially high ecologic importance included two with high sequence similarity (>99%) to the agaric Entoloma conferendum (Britzelm.)

"181","Aphids are major pests of cereal and pasture grasses throughout the world, vectoring disease and reducing plant production. There are few control options other than insecticides. Epichloe endophytes that produce loline alkaloids in their hosts provide a possible mechanism of control, with both meadow fescue and tall fescue naturally infected with loline-producing endophytes showing a resistance to Rhopalosiphum padi. We screened Elymus spp. naturally infected with endophytes that produced loline alkaloids at concentrations known to affect aphids on fescue but found no effect on these insects infesting Elymus. A synthetic loline-producing endophyte association with rye also had no effect on the aphids. After hypothesizing that the lolines were being translocated in the xylem in Elymus and rye rather than the phloem, we tested the rye and meadow fescue infected with loline-producing endophytes against a xylem feeding spittlebug. The endophyte in rye inhibited the feeding of the insect and reduced its survival, whereas the endophyte-infected meadow fescue had no effect on the spittlebug but reduced the number of aphids. Lolines applied to the potting medium of endophyte-free and endophyte-infected rye, ryegrass, and tall fescue resulted in a decrease in the aphid populations on the endophyte-free pasture grasses relative to the untreated controls but had no effect on aphid numbers on the rye. We tentatively conclude that lolines, produced in both natural and synthetic association with Elymus and rye, are partitioned in the xylem rather than the phloem, where they are inaccessible to aphids.","Popay, AJ; Jensen, JG; Simpson, WR; Mace, WJ; Somchit, C",NA,NA,NA,"Popay, Alison J.; Jensen, Joanne G.; Simpson, Wayne R.; Mace, Wade J.; Somchit, Chanatda",NA,"Translocation of Loline Alkaloids in <i>Epichloe</i>-Infected Cereal and Pasture Grasses: What the Insects Tell Us","JOURNAL OF FUNGI",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,", Joanne/KUD-4450-2024","Popay, Alison/0000-0002-0201-5308; Simpson, Wayne/0000-0003-0061-3571",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2309-608X",NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2023,9,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/jof9010096","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof9010096",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36675917,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000914756400001",NA,878,"Both"
"182","Fungal endophytes have been found in every plant species examined to date and appear to be important, but largely unquantified, components of fungal biodiversity. Endophytes are especially little known in tropical forest trees, where their abundance and diversity are thought to be greatest. Here, we explore the occurrence of endophytes in a broad diversity of woody, angiospermous taxa in a lowland, moist tropical forest in central Panama. We use similarity indices to assess host preference and spatial heterogeneity of endophytes associated with two co-occurring but distantly related, understorey tree species in two sites of that forest, and assess the utility of indices based on frequencies of morphospecies occurrence (Morisita-Horn index) and on presence-absence data (Sorensen's index). We suggest that our understanding of fungal diversity will be enhanced by exploring ecological patterns underlying endophyte occurrence in host species, and discuss methods for assessing the proportion of fungal biodiversity represented by tropical endophytes.","Arnold, AE; Maynard, Z; Gilbert, GS",NA,NA,NA,"Arnold, AE; Maynard, Z; Gilbert, GS",NA,"Fungal endophytes in dicotyledonous neotropical trees: patterns of abundance and diversity","MYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"JUL 09-13, 2000","HONG KONG, PEOPLES R CHINA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0953-7562",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2001,105,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1502","1507",NA,"10.1017/S0953756201004956","http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0953756201004956",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000173613200014",NA,3716,"Both"
"183","Fungal endophytes can improve plant tolerance to abiotic stress. However, the role of these plant-fungal interactions in invasive species ecology and their management implications remain unclear. This study characterized the fungal endophyte communities of native and invasive lineages of Phragmites australis and assessed the role of dark septate endophytes (DSE) in salt tolerance of this species. We used Illumina sequencing to characterize root fungal endophytes of contiguous stands of native and invasive P. australis along a salinity gradient. DSE colonization was assessed throughout the growing season in the field, and effects of fungal inoculation on salinity tolerance were investigated using laboratory and greenhouse studies. Native and invasive lineages had distinct fungal endophyte communities that shifted across the salinity gradient. DSE colonization was greater in the invasive lineage and increased with salinity. Laboratory studies showed that DSE inoculation increased P. australis seedling survival under salt stress; and a greenhouse assay revealed that the invasive lineage had higher aboveground biomass under mesohaline conditions when inoculated with a DSE. We observed that P. australis can establish mutualistic associations with DSE when subjected to salt stress. This type of plant-fungal association merits further investigation in integrated management strategies of invasive species and restoration of native Phragmites.","Mateu, MG; Baldwin, AH; Maul, JE; Yarwood, SA",NA,NA,NA,"Mateu, Martina Gonzalez; Baldwin, Andrew H.; Maul, Jude E.; Yarwood, Stephanie A.",NA,"Dark septate endophyte improves salt tolerance of native and invasive lineages of <i>Phragmites australis</i>","ISME JOURNAL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gonzalez Mateu, Martina/LJL-6618-2024","Gonzalez Mateu, Martina/0000-0003-4321-6875",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1751-7362","1751-7370",NA,NA,NA,"AUG",2020,14,"8",NA,NA,NA,"1943","1954",NA,"10.1038/s41396-020-0654-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41396-020-0654-y",NA,"APR 2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,32341473,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000528998300001",NA,3694,"Both"

Bromeliads explore highly stressful habitats and root-associated fungi may play a crucial role in this, but the driving factors and variations in root-associated fungi remain largely unknown. We explored root-associated fungal communities in 17 bromeliad species and their variations linked to host identity, life forms and nutritional modes by using ITS1 gene-based high-throughput sequencing and by characterizing fungal functional guilds. We found a dual association of mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal fungi. The different species, life forms and nutritional modes among bromeliad hosts had fungal communities that differ in their taxonomic and functional composition. Specifically, roots of epiphytic bromeliads had more endophytic fungi and dark septate endophytes and fewer mycorrhizal fungi than terrestrial bromeliads and lithophytes. Our results contribute to a fundamental knowledge base on different fungal groups in previously undescribed Bromeliaceae. The diverse root-associated fungal communities in bromeliads may enhance plant fitness in both stressful and nutrient-poor environments and may give more flexibility to the plants to adapt to changing environmental conditions.","Leroy, C; Maes, AQ; Louisanna, E; Schimann, H; Séjalon-Delmas, N",NA,NA,NA,"Leroy, Celine; Maes, Arthur QuyManh; Louisanna, Eliane; Schimann, Heidy; Sejalon-Delmas, Nathalie",NA,"Taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity of root-associated fungi in bromeliads: effects of host identity, life forms and nutritional modes","NEW PHYTOLOGIST",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Schimann, Heidy/AAN-5252-2020","Sejalon-Delmas, Nathalie/0000-0003-4453-3864; Schimann, Heidy/0000-0002-9139-920X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0028-646X","1469-8137",NA,NA,NA,"AUG",2021,231,"3",NA,NA,NA,"1195","1209",NA,"10.1111/nph.17288","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.17288",NA,"JUN 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,33605460,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000657838000001",NA,1572,"Both"
"185","Phosphate deprivation compromises plant productivity and modulates immunity. DAMP signalling by extracellular ATP (eATP) could be compromised under phosphate deprivation by the lowered production of cytosolic ATP and the need to salvage eATP as a nutritional phosphate source. Phosphate-starved roots of Arabidopsis can still sense eATP, indicating robustness in receptor function. However, the resultant cytosolic free Ca2+ signature is impaired, indicating modulation of downstream components. This perspective on DAMP signalling by extracellular ATP (eATP) addresses the salvage of eATP under phosphate deprivation and its promotion of immunity, how Ca2+ signals are generated and how the Ca2+ signalling pathway could be overcome to allow beneficial fungal root colonization to fulfill phosphate demands. Safe passage for an endophytic fungus allowing root colonization could be achieved by its down-regulation of the Ca2+ channels that act downstream of the eATP receptors and by also preventing ROS accumulation, thus further impairing DAMP signalling.","Matthus, E; Ning, YZ; Shafiq, F; Davies, JM",NA,NA,NA,"Matthus, Elsa; Ning, Youzheng; Shafiq, Fahad; Davies, Julia M.",NA,"Phosphate-deprivation and damage signalling by extracellular ATP","FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ning, Youzheng/LBH-5163-2024; Shafiq, Fahad/H-4519-2019","Shafiq, Fahad/0000-0003-2183-2714",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-462X",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JAN 12",2023,13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3389/fpls.2022.1098146","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.1098146",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36714742,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000920689000001",NA,5880,"Absence"
"186","The transition from mother plant seed production to seedlings recruitment is critical for annual plant species but also for vertically transmitted microbial symbionts. Evidence indicates that microbial symbionts play important roles in plant response to environmental changes. However, their role in plant facing gaseous tropospheric pollutants such as the highly reactive and phytotoxic ozone, have been scarcely studied. Here, we experimentally tested the consequences of maternal plant exposure to ozone on the longevity of Lohum mutiflontm seeds mediated by a vertically-transmitted fungal endophyte (Epichloe occultans). Seeds were produced by mother plants exposed to contrasting levels of ozone (low and high concentrations) in two phases of the life cycle (vegetative and reproductive). We first characterized the consequences of plant exposure to ozone on the state of the antioxidant glutathione in the seeds. Then, we examined viability dynamics of the seeds through an accelerated ageing trial and followed the physiological variables seed water content (SWC) and electrical conductivity (EC). Irrespectively of maternal ozone, seeds produced by endophyte-symbiotic plants presented higher contents of the oxidised form of glutathione. In the same direction, the fungal endophyte presence was associated with a dramatic reduction in seed longevity. The SWC was higher in endophyte-symbiotic seeds that in endophyte-free seeds. As time under accelerated ageing condition advanced, EC increased more in endophytesymbiotic seeds than in endophyte-free seeds. Mother plant exposure to ozone tended to have a negative synergistic effect with the endophyte symbiosis. Ozone transgenerational effect was not detected on endophyte-free seeds. Our work contributes to understand the transgenerational effects of vertically transmitted fungal endophytes in plants in response to a currently important factor of stress.","Ueno, AC; Gundel, PE; Seal, CE; Ghersa, CM; Martinez-Ghersa, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Ueno, Andrea C.; Gundel, Pedro E.; Seal, Charlotte E.; Ghersa, Claudio M.; Alejandra Martinez-Ghersa, Maria",NA,"The negative effect of a vertically-transmitted fungal endophyte on seed longevity is stronger than that of ozone transgenerational effect","ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013","Ueno, Andrea/0000-0002-7853-5270",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0098-8472","1873-7307",NA,NA,NA,"JUL",2020,175,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.104037","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.104037",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000538133100026",NA,8417,"Absence"

A total of 250 plants from three Taiwanese populations (Southeast Coast, Orchid Islet, and Green Islet) and two populations from Ryukyu (Ishigaki and Amami-O-Shima Islets) were sampled. The amplified products of 40 random primers showed monomorphic banding patterns within all populations as well as among the three populations from Taiwan. Low genetic variation (with only two polymorphic loci), but significant differentiation, was detected between populations from Taiwan and Ryukyu (Phi (CT) = 0.864) and between populations (Phi (ST) = 1.0) from Ishigaki and Amami-O-Shima Islets. In contrast, a high level of variation was exhibited in the outcrossing Miscanthus sinensis var. glaber (Nakai) Li. In addition to apomictic reproduction, low genetic variation across populations of M. sinensis var. condensatus may be a result of high salinity acting as a selective agent. With the cost of reduced genetic heterogeneity, apomixis may have provided a mechanism for avoiding the transmission of endophytic fungi.

"191","The use of chemicals to fertilize crops incurs economic and environmental costs and it is widely recognized that the current level of chemical fertilizer use is unsustainable in many intensive farming systems. Any methods that can reduce fertilizer input and still maintain acceptable yields would be of great benefit to both the farmer and the environment. The use of beneficial endophytes as crop inoculants may go some way towards improving crop yields beyond that achievable using fertilizer increases alone. Field trials were conducted over two seasons on three contrasting field sites to test the effects of fungal endophytes from a wild barley relative on three barley cultivars (Mickle, Planet and Propino). Seeds were either untreated or dressed with a consortium of four endophyte strains, and three levels of nitrogen (N) were applied to both treatments: full N, 50% N and 0 N. On the field site with the lowest overall N input, the endophyte treatment with 50% N restored yield for Planet' to that associated with untreated plants receiving the full N input. On the same site and with the same cultivar, endophyte treatment increased yield by 15% under full N, and by a mean 12% for all three cultivars with 50% N input. Over both seasons and all three sites, the endophyte treatment increased yield for the cultivar Planet by a mean of 9%. For the endophyte-associated increase in the variety Planet grain yield over the untreated trials strong correlations were found between increased yield and each of low rainfall, greater evaporation and greater number of degree days above the base. Furthermore, the efficacy of the endophytes was not removed by regular foliar fungicidal treatment.

"192","Fungal endophytes inhabit healthy tissues of all terrestrial plant taxa studied to date and arc diverse and abundant in leaves of tropical woody angiosperms. Studies have demonstrated that plant location and leaf age influence density of endophyte infection in leaves of tropical forest trees. However, ecological factors underlying these observations have not been explored in detail. Here, we establish that foliar endophytes of a tropical tree (Theobroma cacao, Malvaceae) are transmitted horizontally and that endophyte-free seedlings can be produced for experimental manipulation by protecting aerial tissues from surface wetting. At Barro Colorado Island, Panama, we used transects of endophyte-free seedlings to determine the importance of several factors (canopy cover, abundance of aerial and epiphytic propagules, leaf age, leaf chemistry, leaf toughness and duration of exposure to viable air spora) in shaping colonization by endophytic fungi. Endophytes colonized leaves of T cacao more rapidly beneath the forest canopy than in cleared sites, reflecting local abundance of aerial and epiphytic propagules. The duration of exposure, rather than absolute leaf age, influenced endophyte infection, whereas leaf toughness and chemistry had no observed effect. Endophytes isolated from mature T cacao grew more rapidly on media containing leaf extracts of T cacao than on media containing extracts from other co-occurring tree species, suggesting that interspecific differences in leaf chemistry influence endophyte assemblages. Together, these data allow us to identify factors underlying patterns of endophyte colonization within healthy leaves of this tropical tree.","Arnold, AE; Herre, EA",NA,NA,NA,"Arnold, AE; Herre, EA",NA,"Canopy cover and leaf age affect colonization by tropical fungal endophytes:: Ecological pattern and process in <i>Theobroma cacao</i> (Malvaceae)","MYCOLOGIA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0027-5514","1557-2536",NA,NA,NA,"MAY-JUN",2003,95,"3",NA,NA,NA,"388","398",NA,"10.2307/3761880","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3761880",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,21156627,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000184393800002",NA,3737,"Both"
"193","Reports of allelopathy by tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) on Trifolium species are inconsistent. Many tall fescue plants are infected with a fungal endophyte (Acremonium coenophialum Morgan-Jones & Gams), which may account for some of the inconsistencies. My objective was to investigate the allelopathic effect of extracts of endophyte-free (TF-E) and -infected (TF+E) tall fescue seeds on the seed germination and seedling growth (shoot, root, and root-hair length and root-hair density) of five Trifolium species (ball clover, T. nigrescens Viv.; crimson clover, T. incarnatum L.; red clover, T. pratense L.; subterranean clover, T. subterraneum L.; and white clover, T. repens L.). Extracts were prepared by passing 50 g of seed through a pulverizing mill, soaking the milled seed in 500 mL of deionized water, filtering, and sterilizing the solution. Differences among allelopathic effects for seed germination were attributed to legume species. Although the presence of fungal endophyte had no effect on seed germination, germination of hall, crimson, and red clover seed was significantly reduced in extracts of tall fescue seed. Differences among allelopathic effects for shoot and root lengths were attributed to legume species. Seedling shoot length was significantly increased and root length was significantly decreased for clover seedlings grown in tall fescue extracts. Differences among allelopathic effects for Foot-hair length and density were attributed to species and substrate (TF-E vs. TF+E) differences. There was a 34% reduction in root-hair length and a 45% reduction in root-hair density for clover seedlings grown in seed extracts compared with seedlings grown in water. Seed germination and seedling shoot and root lengths inadequately expressed the subtle allelopathic effects of the fungal endophyte. Micromorphological characters, such as root hairs, may be more sensitive in detecting allelopathic effects.","Springer, TL",NA,"",NA,"Springer, TL",NA,"Allelopathic effects on germination and seedling growth of clovers by endophyte-free and -infected tall fescue","CROP SCIENCE",NA,NA,"English","Article",NA,"","","",NA,"","Festuca; Gomphrena nitida; Neotyphodium coenophialum; Schedonorus arundinaceus; Trifolium; Trifolium incarnatum; Trifolium nigrescens; Trifolium pratense; Trifolium repens; Trifolium subterraneum","Springer T.L., USDA-ARS, S.

"194","Symbiotic infection with fungal endophytes has been shown to decrease herbivory in several temperate grasses. We tested the hypothesis that foliar endophytes of grasses may also affect below-ground processes upon their host death, by altering the litter quality for detritivores or the microenvironment for decomposition. Microcosm-litterbag experiments were used to assess decay rates for litter produced by endophyte (Neotyphodium sp.) infected vs uninfected Lolium multiflorum plants, and to examine endophyte-mediated effects of prior site occupants on current litter decomposition. We found that litter from endophyte-infected L. multiflorum decomposed more slowly than litter from endophyte-free conspecifics and from a naturally uninfected grass, Bromus unioloides. Furthermore, the endophyte-grass association modified the decomposition environment, so that B. unioloides litter decomposed faster when placed underneath a thick layer of endophyte-free L. multiflorum litter. Litter decay rates increased with the amount of root debris remaining in situ from the previous season, but were not affected by the infection status of prior site occupants. The lower decomposability of litter from infected L. multiflorum plants persisted across a range of microenvironments, as determined by different amounts of above-ground litter and soil moisture conditions. Endophyte infection tended to reduce the N content of decaying litter; however, litter N and C/N ratio mainly accounted for interspecific differences in decomposition. Our results imply that fungal endophytes not only can affect herbivory food chains, but also soil organisms and the ecosystem processes they regulate. This study suggests a novel role for symbiotic foliar endophytes in linking above-ground and below-ground sub-systems.","Omacini, M; Chaneton, EJ; Ghersa, CM; Otero, P",NA,NA,NA,"Omacini, M; Chaneton, EJ; Ghersa, CM; Otero, P",NA,"Do foliar endophytes affect grass litter decomposition?: A microcosm approach using <i>Lolium multiflorum</i>","OIKOS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Omacini, Marina/0000-0003-1460-262X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0030-1299","1600-0706",NA,NA,NA,"MAR",2004,104,"3",NA,NA,NA,"581","590",NA,"10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12915.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12915.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000189023900017",NA,7059,"Both"

In this study, germination percentage of A. inebrians seeds infected with Epichloeeurogansuensis and non-infected seeds were tested under five salinity concentrations (100 mM, 200 mM, 300 mM, 400 mM and 500 mM) and five water pH levels (pH = 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9) with distilled water (pH = 6.5) as a control. These treatments were carried out in the presence of constant temperatures (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C) under constant light exposure and alternating temperatures (15/5, 20/10, 25/15, 30/20 and 35/25 degrees C) for 12 h light: 12 h dark photoperiod. Germination percentage was calculated after 14 days of incubation under these programmed conditions. Increase in salinity resulted in a gradual decrease in germination percentage while increase in pH up to 7 resulted in increased germination. Germination of endophyte infected and non-infected seeds were increased at 20 degrees C and 25/15 degrees C for constant light and 12:12 h photoperiod. Endophyte infected seeds were found to exhibit the most significant results as compared to non-infected seeds under varying range of salinity, pH, light, photoperiod and temperature indicating that endophyte infection in A. inebrians seeds increased the germination percentage and survival of seeds with the ability to tolerate stress condition.

"196","In the last decade, there has been an increasing focus on the implementation of plant growth-promoting (PGP) organisms as a sustainable option to compensate for poor soil fertility conditions in developing countries. Trap systems were used in an effort to isolate PGP fungi from rhizospheric soil samples collected in the region around Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of Congo. With sudangrass as a host, a highly conducive environment was created for sebacinalean chlamydospore formation inside the plant roots resulting in a collection of 51 axenically cultured isolates of the elusive genus Piriformospora (recently transferred to the genus Serendipita). Based on morphological data, ISSR fingerprinting profiles and marker gene sequences, we propose that these isolates together with Piriformospora williamsii constitute a species complex designated Piriformospora (= Serendipita) 'williamsii.' A selection of isolates strongly promoted plant growth of in vitro inoculated Arabidopsis seedlings, which was evidenced by an increase in shoot fresh weight and a strong stimulation of lateral root formation. This isolate collection provides unprecedented opportunities for fundamental as well as translational research on the Serendipitaceae, a family of fungal endophytes in full expansion.","Venneman, J; Audenaert, K; Verwaeren, J; Baert, G; Boeckx, P; Moango, AM; Dhed'a, BD; Vereecke, D; Haesaert, G",NA,NA,NA,"Venneman, Jolien; Audenaert, Kris; Verwaeren, Jan; Baert, Geert; Boeckx, Pascal; Moango, Adrien M.; Dhed'a, Benoit D.; Vereecke, Danny; Haesaert, Geert",NA,"Congolese Rhizospheric Soils as a Rich Source of New Plant Growth-Promoting Endophytic <i>Piriformospora</i> Isolates","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Vereecke, Danny/KFS-1222-2024","Venneman, Jolien/0000-0002-9791-8816; Audenaert, Kris/0000-0002-8791-1282; Haesaert, Geert/0000-0003-2993-9858; Vereecke, Danny/0000-0003-3706-780X; Verwaeren, Jan/0000-0001-9978-501X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-302X",NA,NA,NA,"FEB 14",2017,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3389/fmicb.2017.00212","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2017.00212",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28261171,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000393839000001",NA,4400,"Absence"

"198","Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) is a very common grass species with a wide distribution, including in Mediterranean areas. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of non-clavicipitaceous fungal endophytes on forage production by P. pratensis, and on the nutritive value and mineral status of its herbage. Plants were inoculated with each of eight endophytic species and grown under greenhouse conditions. After 3 months, the plants were harvested and dried before evaluating the following parameters: dry mass of herbage and roots, crude protein content, neutral detergent fibre content, and mineral contents in herbage. The results showed that endophytes affected the biomass yield (herbage and roots), fibre content, and mineral contents in the forage. Compared with controls, plants inoculated with Stemphylium globuliferum showed the highest herbage and root biomass values, whilst those inoculated with Embellisia leptinellae and S. globuliferum showed reduced fibre contents in herbage. Plants infected with Epicoccum nigrum and S. globuliferum showed increased herbage concentrations of calcium, magnesium, molybdenum, and titanium. These results demonstrate that inoculation of Poa pratensis with endophytes can increase its biomass yield and the nutritive value of its herbage. Therefore, endophyte inoculation may be a useful strategy to reduce nutrient deficiencies in P. pratensis forage.","Lledó, S; Rodrigo, S; Poblaciones, MJ; Santamaria, O",NA,NA,NA,"Lledo, Santiago; Rodrigo, Sara; Poblaciones, Maria J.; Santamaria, Oscar",NA,"Biomass yield, mineral content, and nutritive value of <i>Poa pratensis</i> as affected by non-clavicipitaceous fungal endophytes","MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"rodrigo, sara/L-6541-2014; Poblaciones, Maria/AAA-6673-2019; Santamaria, Oscar/L-8979-2014; Poblaciones, Maria J/K-5106-2014","Santamaria, Oscar/0000-0001-5087-6519; rodrigo, sara/0000-0002-2807-4912; Poblaciones, Maria J/0000-0002-1559-2382",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1617-416X","1861-8952",NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2015,14,"9",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1007/s11557-015-1093-4","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-015-1093-4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000361001200007",NA,4777,"Both"
"199","This paper elaborates the advances made in the study of morphology, phylogeny, host association and geography of novel and interesting fungi in China and Thailand. We documented saprobic microfungi from dead twigs of different plant hosts from Annonaceae (Anomianthus dulcis, Cananga odorata and Desmos chinensis), Apocynaceae (Alstonia scholaris) and Magnoliaceae (Magnolia champaca, M. garrettii and M. liliifera) in Yunnan Province, China and northern Thailand. Descriptions, illustrations and discussions on the familial placement of taxa are given based on phylogeny and morphological data. One new genus Muriformispora in Neohendersoniaceae (Dothideomycetes) and twelve new species, Acrocalymma magnoliae, Diaporthe chiangmaiensis, Fuscostagonospora magnoliae, Gyrothrix anomianthi, Hermatomyces anomianthi, Muriformispora magnoliae, Neomassaria alstoniae, N. thailandica, Neoroussoella thailandica, Peroneutypa anomianthi, Pseudochaetosphaeronema magnoliae and Torula canangae are introduced. An amended account of Hermatomyces is provided to include the sexual morph of the genus. New host records or new country records are provided for Acrocalymma pterocarpi, A. walkeri, Amphisphaeria micheliae, Angustimassarina populi, Aurantiascoma minimum, Diaporthe musigena, D. pterocarpi, Eutypella citricola, Gyrothrix oleae, Hermatomyces sphaericus, Lasiodiplodia crassispora, L. exigua, L. ponkanicola, L. pseudotheobromae, L. thailandica, L. theobromae, Magnibotryascoma kunmingense, Memnoniella ellipsoidea, Melomastia clematidis, M. thamplaensis, Neoroussoella entadae, Nectria pseudotrichia, Nigrograna thymi, Periconia byssoides, P. pseudobyssoides, Phaeosphaeria sinensis, Pseudopithomyces chartarum, Pseudofusicoccum adansoniae, Rhytidhysteron neorufulum, Setoapiospora thailandica and Xenoroussoella triseptata.","de Silva, NI; Hyde, KD; Lumyong, S; Phillips, AJL; Bhat, DJ; Maharachchikumbura, SSN; Thambugala, KM; Tennakoon, DS; Suwannarach, N; Karunarathna, SC",NA,NA,NA,"de Silva, N., I; Hyde, K.

"200","A large literature concerns the epidemiology of single pathogens on single hosts. Yet in some environmental applications,such as fungal pathogens of forest tree seedlings,the ""one host-one pathogen"" paradigm may not be applicable. Multiple potential pathogens are often found in a single individual and/or multiple hosts share the same pathogens. Understanding diversity requires techniques to infer how multiple pathogens might regulate multiple hosts and to predict how imp acts might vary with the environment. Here we present a hierarchical framework for the case where there is detection information based on multiple sources(cultures, gene sequencing,and survival observations),and the inference problem includes not only parameters that describe environmental influences on pathogen incidence infection, and host survival, but also on latent states themselves-pathogen incidence at a site and infection statuses of hosts. Due to the large size of the model space, we develop a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to select models, estimate posterior distributions, and predict environmental influences on host survival. we demonstrate with application to a data set involving fungal pathogens on tree hosts,where data include host survival and fungal detection using cultures and DNA sequencing.","Clark, JS; Hersh, MH",NA,NA,NA,"Clark, James S.; Hersh, Michelle H.",NA,"Inference in incidence, infection, and impact: Co-infection of multiple hosts by multiple pathogens","BAYESIAN ANALYSIS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hersh, Michelle/D-2079-2009; Clark, James/G-6331-2011","Hersh, Michelle/0000-0003-1174-7575",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1931-6690","1936-0975",NA,NA,NA,NA,2009,4,"2",NA,NA,NA,"337","365",NA,"10.1214/09-BA413","http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/09-BA413",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000273483400010",NA,167,"Absence"
