Presence,"Pepper yellow leaf curl disease caused by Pepper yellow leaf curl virus becomes a major problem on chilli pepper in Indonesia since 1999. Endophytic fungi has the potency to suppress plant diseases by acting as induced resistant agent. The objective of this research was to determine the effect of endophytic fungi application on incidence of yellow leaf curl disease of chilli pepper. Four isolates of endophytic fungi, i.e. Cercospora nicotianae isolate H5, Curvularia sp. isolate H12, Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 and AC-4.5 were applied as seed treatment and leaf spray on 2 chilli varieties, 'Biola' and 'Luwes'. Observations of incubation period showed that delayed symptom occurred on application of Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 and Curvularia sp. isolate H12. Disease incidence reached 100 % in all treatments. Less severe symptom was observed on application of Curvularia sp. isolate H12. Most plants infected by PYLCIV showed obvious symptoms of yellow mosaic, leaf curling and stunting. Plant productivity analysis showed that application of Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 resulted higher fruit weight and this treatment may induce tolerant response of the plants to PYLCIV infection. Initial effort to evaluate endophytic fungi as biocontrol agents for pepper yellow leaf curl disease should be studied further.",J,"Lestari, SM; Hidayat, H; Widodo, W",NA,,,"Lestari, Susanti Mugi; Hidayat, Hendrastuti; Widodo, Widodo",NA,NA,Determination of Endophytic Fungi as Induce Resistance Agent of Chilli Pepper Against Pepper Yellow Leaf Curl Disease,AGRIVITA,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Widodo, Widodo/AIB-4133-2022; WIDODO, WIDODO/JGL-6847-2023; Lestari, Susanti Mugi/JKH-8021-2023; Widodo, Widodo/GPW-6341-2022","Widodo, Widodo/0000-0001-5479-6815; Mugi Lestari, Susanti/0000-0003-0722-8545",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0126-0537,,,NA,NA,JUN,2018,40,2,NA,,,NA,249,256,,10.17503/agrivita.v40i2.989,http://dx.doi.org/10.17503/agrivita.v40i2.989,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000438777200008,View Full Record in Web of Science,465,Presence
Presence,"Endophytic fungi were isolated from healthy, living, and symptomless tissues of inner bark, leaf, and roots of Aegle marmelos, a well-known medicinal plant, growing in different parts of India including Varanasi. A total of 79 isolates of endophytic fungi were isolated, representing 21 genera, adopting a standard isolation protocol. Members of the deuteromycotina were more prevalent than ascomycotina and others. The result was quite encouraging in terms of maximum isolates recovery from hyphomycetes (78.5%) followed by ascomycetes (8.9%) and coelomycetes (7.6%) respectively, which corroborates previous studies in same area. However, 5.1% isolates remained unidentified and were classified under Mycelia Sterilia. No isolate was obtained from either basidiomycotina or from zygomycotina. Fusarium spp. had maximum colonization frequency (8.00%) in this plant. The other dominant endophytic genera were Aspergillus spp., Alternaria sp., Drechslera sp., Rhizoctonia sp., Curvularia sp., Nigrospora sp., and Stenella sp. Only two ascomycetous members Chaetomium globosum and Emericella sp. (perfect state of Aspergillus sp.) were obtained from the bark sample.

Presence,"Introduction In addition to the mycotoxin swainsonine, the locoweed endophytic fungus Alternaria oxytropis (Pleosporaceae) also produces a series of rarely reported, highly oxygenated bicyclic guaiane sesquiterpenoids. Few investigations on the electrospray tandem mass fragmentation pattern of this sesquiterpenoid have been reported. Objectives We aimed to analyze and detect new guaiane sesquiterpenoid analogues from crude extracts of the locoweed endophytic fungus A. oxytropis by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS experiments. Materials and Methods Oxytropiols A-J (1-10) and the extract of the locoweed endophytic fungus A. oxytropis were analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS in positive mode. Results Typical neutral losses, McLafferty rearrangement, 1,2-rearrangement, and 1,3-rearrangement were considered to be the main fragmentation patterns for the [M + H](+)/[M + Na](+) ions of 1-10 by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS experiments, and possible fragmentation pathways of 1-10 were suggested. A unique and undescribed analogue named oxytropiol K (11) was found in the extract based on UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis. Compound 11 was isolated and elucidated by NMR spectrometry, and its UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis was consistent with the fragmentation pathways of 1-10. Conclusion The results further support that UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS is a powerful and sensitive tool for the characterization of known compounds (dereplication) and the detection of new analogues from crude extracts and imply that the locoweed endophytic fungus A. oxytropis, with few chemical investigations, is an important resource for undescribed metabolites.",J,"Tan, XM; Li, Q; Wang, YD; Wang, TL; Yang, J; Sun, BD; Guo, LP; Ding, G",NA,,,"Tan, Xiang-Mei; Li, Qi; Wang, Yan-Duo; Wang, Tie-Lin; Yang, Jian; Sun, Bing-Da; Guo, Lan-Ping; Ding, Gang",NA,NA,UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis of the guaiane sesquiterpenoids oxytropiols A-J and detection of undescribed analogues from the locoweed endophytic fungus Alternaria oxytropis (Pleosporaceae),PHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"tan, xiangmei/GZA-7369-2022",,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0958-0344,1099-1565,,NA,NA,APR,2022,33,3,NA,,,NA,344,354,,10.1002/pca.3092,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.3092,,Nov-21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34755399,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000716097400001,View Full Record in Web of Science,682,Presence

Presence,"Opuntia ficus-indica Mill. (forage cactus) is farmed with relative success in the semi-arid region of the Brazilian northeast for commercial purposes, particularly as forage and food. Endophytic microorganisms are those that can be isolated inside plant tissues and can be a new source to production of enzymes with different potentialities. The objective of this study was to describe the richness of endophytic fungi from O. ficus-indica and to detect the capacity of these species to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. Forty-four endophytic fungi species were isolated. Among them, the most commonly found were Cladosporium cladosporioides (20.43%) and C. sphaerospermum (15.99%). Acremonium terricola, Monodictys castaneae, Penicillium glandicola, Phoma tropica and Tetraploa aristata are being reported for the first time as endophytic fungi for Brazil. The majority of isolated fungi exhibited enzymatic potential. Aspergillus japonicus and P. glandicola presented pectinolytic activity. Xylaria sp. was the most important among the other 14 species with positive cellulase activity. All 24 isolates analysed were xylanase-positive. Protease was best produced by isolate PF103. The results indicate that there is a significant richness of endophytic fungi in O. ficus-indica, and that these isolates indicate promising potential for deployment in biotechnological processes involving production of pectinases, cellulases, xylanases and proteases.",J,"Bezerra, JDP; Santos, MGS; Svedese, VM; Lima, DMM; Fernandes, MJS; Paiva, LM; Souza-Motta, CM",NA,,,"Bezerra, J.

Review,"Medicinal plants are an important source of bioactive compounds and have been used to isolate various bioactive compounds having industrial applications. The demand for plants derived bioactive molecules is increasing gradually. However, the extensive use of these plants to extract bioactive molecules has threatened many plant species. Moreover, extracting bioactive molecules from these plants is laborious, costly, and time-consuming. So, some alternative sources and strategies are urgently needed to produce these bioactive molecules similar to that of plant origin. However, the interest in new bioactive molecules has recently shifted from plants to endophytic fungi because many fungi produce bioactive molecules similar to their host plant. Endophytic fungi live in mutualistic association within the healthy plant tissue without causing disease symptoms to the host plant. These fungi are a treasure house of novel bioactive molecules having broad pharmaceutical, industrial, and agricultural applications. The rapid increase in publications in this domain over the last three decades proves that natural product biologists and chemists are paying great attention to the natural bioactive products from endophytic fungi. Though endophytes are source of novel bioactive molecules but there is need of advanced technologies like clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) and epigenetic modifiers to enhance the production of compounds having industrial applications. This review provides an overview of the various industrial applications of bioactive molecules produced by endophytic fungi and the rationale behind selecting specific plants for fungal endophyte isolation. Overall, this study presents the current state of knowledge and highlights the potential of endophytic fungi for developing alternative therapies for drug-resistant infections.",J,"Anand, K; Kumar, V; Prasher, IB; Sethi, M; Raj, H; Ranjan, H; Chand, S; Pandey, GK",NA,,,"Anand, Kumar; Kumar, Vijay; Prasher, Indu Bhushan; Sethi, Megha; Raj, Harsh; Ranjan, Himanshu; Chand, Subhash; Pandey, Gaurav Kumar",NA,NA,Bioactive molecules from fungal endophytes and their applications in pharmaceutical industries: challenges and future scope,JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,"Kumar, Vijay/0000-0001-7935-3711",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0233-111X,1521-4028,,NA,NA,JUL,2023,63,7,NA,,SI,NA,690,708,,10.1002/jobm.202200696,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.202200696,,Mar-23,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36998101,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000961385800001,View Full Record in Web of Science,593,Review

Presence,"Glioblastoma is the most devastating primary brain tumor. Current treatment is palliative, making necessary the development of new therapeutic strategies to offer alternatives to patients. Therefore, endophytes represent an interesting source of natural metabolites with anticancer potential. These microorganisms reside in tissues of living plants and act to improve their growth. Evidence revealed that several medicinal plants are colonized by endophytic fungi producer of antitumor metabolites. Achyrocline satureioides is a Brazilian medicinal plant characterized by its properties against gastrointestinal disturbances, anticancer and antioxidant effects. However, there are no reports describing the endophytic composition of A. satureioides. The present study proposes the isolation of endophytic fungus from A. satureioides, extract preparation, phytochemical characterization and evaluation of its antiglioma potential. Our data showed that crude extracts of endophyte decreased glioma viability with IC50 values of 1.60-1.63 mu g/mL to eDCM (dichloromethane extract) and 37.30-55.12 mu g/mL to eEtAc (ethyl acetate extract), respectively. Crude extracts induced cell death by apoptosis with modulation of redox status. In order to bioprospect anticancer metabolites, endophytic fungus extracts were subjected to guided fractionation and purification yielded five fractions of each extract. Six of ten fractions showed selective antiproliferative activity against glioma cells, with IC50 values ranged from 0.95 to 131.3 mu g/mL. F3(DCM) (from eDCM) and F3(EtA)(c) (from eEtAc) fractions promoted C6 glioma toxicity with IC50 of 1.0 and 27.05 mu g/mL, respectively. F3(EtA)(c) fraction induced late apoptosis and arrest in G2/M stage, while F3(DCM) promoted apoptosis with arrest in Sub-G1 phase. Moreover, F3(DCM) increased antioxidant defense and decreased ROS production. Additionally, F3(DCM) showed no cytotoxic activity against astrocytes, revealing selective effect. Based on promising potential of F3(DCM), we identified the production of Sch-642305, a lactone, which showed antiproliferative properties with IC50 values of 1.1 and 7.6 mu g/mL to C6 and U138MG gliomas, respectively. Sch-642305 promoted arrest on cell cycle in G2/M inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, this lactone decreased glioma cell migration and modulated redox status, increasing superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and enhancing sulfhydryl content, consequently suppressing reactive species of oxygen generation.

Review,"Insect association with fungi has a long history. Theories dealing with the evolution of insect herbivory indicate that insects used microbes including fungi as their principal food materials before flowering plants evolved. Subtlety and the level of intricacy in the interactions between insects and fungi indicate symbiosis as the predominant ecological pattern. The nature of the symbiotic interaction that occurs between two organisms (the insect and the fungus), may be either mutualistic or parasitic, or between these two extremes. However, the triangular relationship involving three organisms, viz., an insect, a fungus, and a vascular plant is a relationship that is more complicated than what can be described as either mutualism or parasitism, and may represent facets of both. Recent research has revealed such a complex relationship in the vertically transmitted type-I endophytes living within agriculturally important grasses and the pestiferous insects that attack them. The intricacy of the association depends on the endophytic fungus-grass association and the insect present. Secondary compounds produced in the endophytic fungus-grass association can provide grasses with resistance to herbivores resulting in mutualistic relationship between the fungus and the plant that has negative consequences for herbivorous insects. The horizontally transmitted nongrass type-II endophytes are far less well studied and as such their ecological roles are not fully understood. This forum article explores the intricacy of dependence in such complex triangular relationships drawing from well-established examples from the fungi that live as endophytes in vascular plants and how they impact on the biology and evolution of free-living as well as concealed (e. g., gall-inducing, gall-inhabiting) insects. Recent developments with the inoculation of strains of type-I fungal endophytes into grasses and their commercialization are discussed, along with the possible roles the endophytic fungi play in the galls induced by the Cecidomyiidae (Diptera).",J,"Raman, A; Wheatley, W; Popay, A",NA,,,"Raman, A.; Wheatley, W.; Popay, A.",NA,NA,Endophytic Fungus-Vascular Plant-Insect Interactions,ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,"Raman, Anantanarayanan/0000-0002-7293-7412; Popay, Alison/0000-0002-0201-5308",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0046-225X,1938-2936,,NA,NA,JUN,2012,41,3,NA,,,NA,433,447,,10.1603/EN11317,http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EN11317,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,22732600,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000305475600004,View Full Record in Web of Science,403,Review
Presence,"The association of plant with microorganisms, such as dark septate endophytic fungi, has mitigated the harmful effects of chemical, physical, and biological agents on the host. The objective of this work was to evaluate the interaction of the dark septate endophytic fungi with cowpea plants under salt stress. Endophytic fungi were isolated from Vochysia divergens root system, and molecular identification of fungi was performed by sequencing the ITS region. We selected and identified Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and Melanconiella elegans-21W2 for their ability to infect V. divergens root in vitro with development of typical dark septate fungi structures. Cowpea plants-inoculated or not inoculated with Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and M. elegans 21W2-were cultivated in 5-L pots under greenhouse conditions and submitted to four different electrical conductivities of irrigation water (1.2, 2.2, 3.6, and 5.0 dS m(-1)). The salinity caused decrease in leaf concentration of K and increased leaf concentration of calcium, sodium, and chlorine; and no influence of dark septate endophytic fungi was observed in these responses. On the other hand, root colonization with Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and M. elegans 21W2 resulted in improved nutrition with N and P in cowpea under salt stress, favoring the growth and rate of liquid photosynthesis. However, such positive responses were evident only at moderate levels of salinity.",J,"Farias, GC; Nunes, KG; Soares, MA; de Siqueira, KA; Lima, WC; Neves, ALR; de Lacerda, CF; Gomes, E",NA,,,"Farias, Gabriel Castro; Nunes, Kenya Goncalves; Soares, Marcos Antonio; de Siqueira, Katia Aparecida; Lima, William Cardoso; Rocha Neves, Antonia Leila; de Lacerda, Claudivan Feitosa; Gomes Filho, Eneas",NA,NA,Dark septate endophytic fungi mitigate the effects of salt stress on cowpea plants,BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Soares, Marcos Antonio/B-7683-2013; Lacerda, Claudivan/AAG-3391-2020; Nunes, Kenya/AAL-4028-2021; Soares, Marcos/Y-7844-2019; Gomes-Filho, Enéas/AAG-2144-2020","Soares, Marcos Antonio/0000-0002-8938-3188; Lacerda, Claudivan/0000-0002-5324-8195; Nunes, Kenya/0000-0001-8996-1497; Soares, Marcos/0000-0002-8938-3188; Gomes-Filho, Enéas/0000-0001-5945-6596; Farias, Gabriel Castro/0000-0001-6270-6277",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1517-8382,1678-4405,,NA,NA,MAR,2020,51,1,NA,,,NA,243,253,,10.1007/s42770-019-00173-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42770-019-00173-4,,Oct-19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31656023,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000492656000001,View Full Record in Web of Science,461,Presence
Presence,"Saikosaponin d (SSd) is an important bioactive compound of traditional Chinese medicinal plant Bupleurum scorzonerifolium Willd. and exhibits many effects, such as anti-tumor, anti-inflammation and immunomodulatory. Since endophytic fungi possess the natural capacity to produce the similar secondary metabolite to that of their host plants, they are promising as alternative sources of plant bioactive natural products. In this study, in order to search for SSd-producing strains, endophytes were isolated from B. scorzonerifolium and were authenticated by the ITS sequence and the translation elongation factor-1alpha gene (TEF-1 alpha) sequence analysis. The profile of metabolites present in the crude exacts was carried out by ultra performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) analysis. The results showed that two strains, CHS2 and CHS3 from B. scorzonerifolium could produce SSd by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS analysis, and the amount of SSd produced by strain CHS2 and CHS3 were about 2.17 and 2.40 mu g/mL, respectively. CHS2 and CHS3 showed a close phylogenetic relationship to Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium acuminatum, respectively. According to our concern, no endophytic fungi capable of producing SSd from B. scorzonerifolium have been found before. Our clear intention was to isolate and identify these endophytic fungi that produce important active secondary metabolites, and then study the strains that produce this compound on a large scale through fermentation or even genetic study, to provide a feasible and more convenient way for the production of SSd.",J,"Cheng, YP; Liu, GJ; Li, ZM; Zhou, YQ; Gao, N",NA,,,"Cheng, Yupeng; Liu, Guangjie; Li, Zhongmeng; Zhou, Yongqiang; Gao, Ning",NA,NA,Screening saikosaponin d (SSd)-producing endophytic fungi from Bupleurum scorzonerifolium Willd,WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,0959-3993,1573-0972,,NA,NA,DEC,2022,38,12,NA,,,NA,,,242,10.1007/s11274-022-03434-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-022-03434-x,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36280622,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000871419600002,View Full Record in Web of Science,141,Presence
Presence,"Plants cope with abiotic stress in several ways, including by collaborating with microorganisms. Epichloe, an endophytic fungus, has been shown to improve plant tolerance to extreme external environments. Hordeum bogdanii is a known salt-tolerant plant with the potential to improve alkaline lands. NHX1 plays a key role in the transport of ions in the cell and is overexpressed in plants with increased salt tolerance. However, the expression levels of HbNHX1 in Epichloe endophytic fungal symbionts in H. bogdanii have not been elucidated. We used Hordeum bogdanii (E+) with the endophytic fungi Epichloe bromicola and H. bogdanii (E-) without the endophytic fungi and compared the differences in the ion content and HbNHX1 expression between the shoots and roots of E+ and E- plants under alkaline stress. The absorption capacity of both K+ and Na+ of H. bogdanii with endophytic fungi was higher than that without endophytic fungi. In the absence of alkaline stress, endophytic fungi significantly reduced the Cl- content in the host H. bogdanii. Alkaline stress reduced SO42- content in H. bogdanii; however, compared with E-, endophytic fungi increased the content of SO42- in E+ plants. With an increase in the alkaline concentration, the expression of HbNHX1 in the roots of H. bogdanii with endophytic fungus exhibited an upward trend, whereas the expression in the shoots exhibited a downward trend first and then an upward trend. Under 100 mmol center dot L-1 mixed alkaline stress, the expression of HbNHX1 in E+ was significantly higher than that in E-, indicating that endophytic fungi could increase the Na+ region in vacuoles. The external environment affects the regulation of endophytic fungi in H. bogdanii and that endophytic fungi can play a key role in soil salinization. Therefore, the findings of this study will provide technical support and a theoretical basis for better utilization of endophytic fungi from H. bogdanii in saline land improvement.",J,"Long, F; Hu, MF; Chen, S; Bao, GS; Dan, H; Chen, SH",NA,,,"Long, Feng; Hu, Meng-Fei; Chen, Sheng; Bao, Gen-Sheng; Dan, Han; Chen, Shui-Hong",NA,NA,Endophytic Fungi Regulate HbNHX1 Expression and Ion Balance in Hordeum bogdanii under Alkaline Stress,JOURNAL OF FUNGI,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hu, Mengfei/ABG-3590-2020; Long, Feng/AAN-4694-2021","Hu, Mengfei/0000-0003-4272-144X;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,2309-608X,,NA,NA,MAR,2023,9,3,NA,,,NA,,,331,10.3390/jof9030331,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof9030331,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36983499,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000958230700001,View Full Record in Web of Science,31,Presence
Presence,"Background: Paclitaxel (Taxol (TM)) is an important anticancer drug with a unique mode of action. The biosynthesis of paclitaxel had been considered restricted to the Taxus species until it was discovered in Taxomyces andreanae, an endophytic fungus of T. brevifolia. Subsequently, paclitaxel was found in hazel (Corylus avellana L.) and in several other endophytic fungi. The distribution of paclitaxel in plants and endophytic fungi and the reported sequence homology of key genes in paclitaxel biosynthesis between plant and fungi species raises the question about whether the origin of this pathway in these two physically associated groups could have been facilitated by horizontal gene transfer. Results: The ability of the endophytic fungus of hazel Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 to independently synthesize paclitaxel was established by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance. The genome of Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 was sequenced and gene candidates that may be involved in paclitaxel biosynthesis were identified by comparison with the 13 known paclitaxel biosynthetic genes in Taxus. We found that paclitaxel biosynthetic gene candidates in P. aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 have evolved independently and that horizontal gene transfer between this endophytic fungus and its plant host is unlikely. Conclusions: Our findings shed new light on how paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungi synthesize paclitaxel, and will facilitate metabolic engineering for the industrial production of paclitaxel from fungi.",J,"Yang, YF; Zhao, HN; Barrero, RA; Zhang, BH; Sun, GL; Wilson, IW; Xie, FL; Walker, KD; Parks, JW; Bruce, R; Guo, GW; Chen, L; Zhang, Y; Huang, X; Tang, Q; Liu, HW; Bellgard, MI; Qiu, DY; Lai, JS; Hoffman, A",NA,,,"Yang, Yanfang; Zhao, Hainan; Barrero, Roberto A.; Zhang, Baohong; Sun, Guiling; Wilson, Iain W.; Xie, Fuliang; Walker, Kevin D.; Parks, Joshua W.; Bruce, Robert; Guo, Guangwu; Chen, Li; Zhang, Yong; Huang, Xin; Tang, Qi; Liu, Hongwei; Bellgard, Matthew I.; Qiu, Deyou; Lai, Jinsheng; Hoffman, Angela",NA,NA,Genome sequencing and analysis of the paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungus Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431,BMC GENOMICS,,NA,NA,NA,,,,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wilson, Iain/D-4839-2009; Zhang, Yong/AAS-3454-2020; Zhang, Baohong/O-4948-2016","Wilson, Iain/0000-0002-4626-8059; Bellgard, Matthew/0000-0002-6303-9469; Zhang, Yong/0000-0002-2276-7187; Walker, Kevin/0000-0001-5208-6692; Barrero, Roberto/0000-0002-7735-665X; Tang, Qi/0000-0003-2385-4263",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,1471-2164,,,NA,NA,25-Jan,2014,15,,NA,,,NA,,,69,10.1186/1471-2164-15-69,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-15-69,,,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,24460898,NA,NA,NA,NA,WOS:000332573300001,View Full Record in Web of Science,115,Presence
Presence,"Endophytic fungi constitute a major part of the still unexplored fungal diversity and have gained interest as new biological sources of natural active compounds, including enzymes. Endophytic fungi were isolated from soybean leaves and initially screened on agar plates for the production of CMCase (carboxymethylcellulase), xylanase, amylase and protease. The highest Enzymatic Indexes (IE) were verified for xylanase (2.14 and 1.31) with the fungi M6-A6P5F2 and M12-A5P3F1.2 and CMCase (1.92 and 1.62) with the fungi M13-A9P2F1 and M12-A5P3F1.2, respectively. The production of xylanase and CMCase by the selected fungi was evaluated in submerged cultivation using beechwood xylan and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), as well as sugarcane straw and bagasse in different ratios as carbon sources. Both types of lignocellulosic biomass proved to be good inducers of enzymatic activity. The best xylanase producer among the isolates was identified as Colletotrichum boninense. With this fungus, the highest xylanase activity was obtained with a sugarcane straw-bagasse mixture in a 50:50 ratio (383.63 U mL(-1)), a result superior to that obtained with the use of beechwood xylan (296.65 U mL(-1)). Regardingthe kinetic behavior of the crude xylanase, there was found optimal pH of 5.0 and optimal temperatures of 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C. At 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C, xylanase retained 87% and 76% of its initial catalytic activity, respectively.

Presence,"The microecology of endophytic fungi in special habitats, such as the interior of different tissues from a medicinal plant, and its effects on the formation of metabolites with different biological activities are of great importance. However, the factors affecting fungal community formation are unclear. This study is the first to utilize mini-community remodeling to understand the above phenomena. First, high-throughput sequencing technology was applied to explore the community composition and diversity of endophytic fungi in the above-ground tissues (Ea) and below-ground tissues (Eb) of Ephedra sinica. Second, fungi were obtained through culture-dependent technology and used for mini-community remodeling in vitro. Then, the effects of environmental factors, partner fungi, and plant tissue fluid (internal environment) on endophytic fungal community formation were discussed. Results showed that environmental factors played a decisive role in the selection of endophytic fungi, that is, in Ea and Eb, 93.8% and 25.3% of endophytic fungi were halophilic, respectively, and 10.6% and 60.2% fungi were sensitive to high temperature (33 & DEG;C), respectively. Meanwhile, pH had little effect on fungal commu-nities.
