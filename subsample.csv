"1","Air pollution caused by tropospheric ozone contributes to the decline of forest ecosystems; for instance, sacred fir, Abies religiosa (Kunth) Schltdl. & Cham. forests in the peri-urban region of Mexico City. Individual trees within these forests exhibit variation in their response to ozone exposure, including the severity of visible symptoms in needles. Using RNA-Seq metatranscriptomic data and ITS2 metabarcoding, we investigated whether symptom variation correlates with the taxonomic and functional composition of fungal mycobiomes from needles collected in this highly polluted area in the surroundings of Mexico City. Our findings indicate that ozone-related symptoms do not significantly correlate with changes in the taxonomic composition of fungal mycobiomes. However, genes coding for 30 putative proteins were differentially expressed in the mycobiome of asymptomatic needles, including eight genes previously associated with resistance to oxidative stress. These results suggest that fungal communities likely play a role in mitigating the oxidative burst caused by tropospheric ozone in sacred fir. Our study illustrates the feasibility of using RNA-Seq data, accessible from global sequence repositories, for the characterization of fungal communities associated with plant tissues, including their gene expression.","Flores-Almaraz, VS; Truong, C; Hernández-Oaxaca, D; Reyes-Galindo, V; Mastretta-Yanes, A; Jaramillo-Correa, JP; Salas-Lizana, R",NA,NA,NA,"Flores-Almaraz, Valeria Stephany; Truong, Camille; Hernandez-Oaxaca, Diana; Reyes-Galindo, Veronica; Mastretta-Yanes, Alicia; Jaramillo-Correa, Juan Pablo; Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo",NA,"Foliar mycobiome remains unaltered under urban air-pollution but differentially express stress-related genes","MICROBIAL ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Mastretta, Alicia/KTI-1558-2024; Truong, Camille/R-7670-2019; Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo/LCL-2439-2024","Salas-Lizana, Rodolfo/0000-0002-0761-2910; Reyes-Galindo, Veronica/0000-0003-0688-2203; Mastretta-Yanes, Alicia/0000-0003-2951-6353; Jaramillo-Correa, Juan P./0000-0001-7617-913X; Hernandez Oaxaca, Diana/0000-0001-6218-8297; Truong, Camille/0000-0002-8510-1761; Flores Almaraz, Valeria/0009-0003-8601-8462",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0095-3628","1432-184X",NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2024,87,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1007/s00248-024-02387-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-024-02387-y",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38755460,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001227211200001",NA,616,"Absence"
"2","Chinese cabbage seedlings inoculated with an isolate of the hyphomycete, Heteroconium chaetospira, were transplanted to the field. After 3 months, they showed a 52-97% reduction in clubroot and a 49-67% reduction in Verticillium yellows compared with noninoculated controls. H. chaetospira colonized the cortical cells, especially in the root tip region. Infected plants showed no disease symptoms. The infection process involves the formation of appressoria on the cell surface and the subsequent growth of hyphae within cells. H. chaetospira colonized 18 plant species, indicating a wide range of hosts.

"3","In a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial experiment, plants of one genotype of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) were grown in soil in pots in a glasshouse on two occasions. The treatments were either with (E+) or without (E-) infection by the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum; with (N+) or without (N-) inoculation by the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne marylandi; and with or without water deficit stress. In the first experiment, nematode numbers after 5 weeks had increased 10 times in the E-/N- watered pots and 22 times in the E-/N+ stressed plants. Root dry weight was decreased in all E-/N+ pots, compared with E-/N-. In contrast, nematode numbers in all E+/N+ pots decreased to nearly zero and root dry weight was unaffected. Osmotic adjustment in the growing zone of stressed plants was -0.35 MPa in E-/N- pots, but only -0.10 MPa in E-/N+ pots. Osmotic adjustment was greatest (-0.64 MPa) in E+ pots of both nematode treatments and almost no nematodes survived in the N+ pots. In the second experiment, there was complete nematode mortality in the E+ pots. Plant water relations were unaffected by treatments, however. It is concluded that endophyte-enhanced persistence of tall rescue in M. marylandi-infested soils that are prone to drought may be explained at least partly by endophyte protection of roots from nematode damage. Nematode inhibition by the endophyte may operate in addition to direct influences of the endophyte on enhancing drought tolerance of the host.","Elmi A.A.; West C.P.; Robbins R.T.; Kirkpatrick T.L.",NA,"",NA,"Elmi, A.A.

"4","Treatment of suspension cells of Ginkgo biloba with fungal endophytes resulted in accumulation of flavonoids, increased abscisic acid (ABA) production and activation of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). Fluridone, an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis, was effective in inhibiting fungal endophytes-induced ABA biosynthesis, increase of PAL activity and flavonoids accumulation. Moreover, exogenous application of ABA enhanced PAL activity and increased accumulation of flavonoids in G. biloba cells with or without fungal endophytes elicitor. These finding suggest a causal relationship between ABA release and both PAL activity and flavonoid accumulation under fungal endophytes treatment and that ABA is involved in fungal endophytes-induced flavonoids accumulation in this plant.","Hao, GP; Du, XH; Zhao, FX; Ji, HW",NA,NA,NA,"Hao, Gangping; Du, Xihua; Zhao, Faxing; Ji, Haiwei",NA,"Fungal endophytes-induced abscisic acid is required for flavonoid accumulation in suspension cells of Ginkgo biloba","BIOTECHNOLOGY LETTERS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0141-5492","1573-6776",NA,NA,NA,"FEB",2010,32,"2",NA,NA,NA,"305","314",NA,"10.1007/s10529-009-0139-6","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10529-009-0139-6",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19821072,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000273683000020",NA,9028,"Absence"

"7","An experiment was designed to determine the effect of the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium lolii on the growth, physiological parameters and mineral element content of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perennel L.), when growing at two N supply levels. Endophyte infection had a significant positive effect on both shoot and root growth of ryegrass, but this difference was only significant in the high N supply treatment. At high N supply, endophyte-infected (EI) plants accumulated more soluble sugar in the sheath and the root than endophyte-free (EF) plants. Endophyte infection affected mineral element concentrations in the root more than in the shoot. We found a significant effect of endophyte infection on B, Mn and Mg in the root, but significant effect was only found on B in the shoot. EI plants tended to accumulate less B in the shoot at both N levels, but accumulated more B, Mn and Mg in the root at low N levels. The difference of growth parameters in different periods was significant. The content of soluble sugar and crude protein in the sheath were also dependent on the growth stages of both EI and EF plants.","Ren, AZ; Gao, YB; Wang, W; Wang, JL; Zhao, NX",NA,NA,NA,"Ren, An-Zhi; Gao, Yu-Bao; Wang, Wei; Wang, Jin-Long; Zhao, Nian-Xi",NA,"Influence of Nitrogen Fertilizer and Endophyte Infection on Ecophysiological Parameters and Mineral Element Content of Perennial Ryegrass","JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE PLANT BIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1672-9072","1744-7909",NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2009,51,"1",NA,NA,NA,"75","83",NA,"10.1111/j.1744-7909.2008.00721.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1744-7909.2008.00721.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,19166497,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000262106300011",NA,800,"Absence"
"8","Extraneous DNA interferes with PCR studies of endophytic fungi. A procedure was developed with which to evaluate the removal of extraneous DNA. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) leaves were sprayed with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and then subjected to physical and chemical surface treatments. The fungal ITS1 products were amplified from whole tissue DNA extractions. ANOVA was performed on the DNA bands representing S. cerevisiae on the agarose gel. Band profile comparisons using permutational multivariate ANOVA (PERMANOVA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) were performed on DGGE gel data, and band numbers were compared between treatments. Leaf surfaces were viewed under variable pressure scanning electron microscopy (VPSEM). Yeast band analysis of the agarose gel showed that there was no significant difference in the mean band DNA quantity after physical and chemical treatments, but they both differed significantly (p < 0.05) from the untreated control. PERMANOVA revealed a significant difference between all treatments (p < 0.05). The mean similarity matrix showed that the physical treatment results were more reproducible than those from the chemical treatment results. The NMDS showed that the physical treatment was the most consistent. VPSEM indicated that the physical treatment was the most effective treatment to remove surface microbes and debris. The use of molecular and microscopy methods for the post-treatment detection of yeast inoculated onto wheat leaf surfaces demonstrated the effectiveness of the surface treatment employed, and this can assist researchers in optimizing their surface sterilization techniques in DNA-based fungal endophyte studies. © 2014, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.","Burgdorf R.J.; Laing M.D.; Morris C.D.; Jamal-Ally S.F.",NA,"",NA,"Burgdorf, R.J.

Ergovaline concentration in seed ranged from 2 to 6,064 ng/g in 1991 and from 3 to 8,659 ng/g in 1992; mean ergovaline concentration in seeds from EC genotypes was similar (F value = 0.21) in 1991 (2,509 ng/g) and 1992 (2,295 ng/g). Percent endophyte-infected seeds (stained and examined microscopically) among E+ genotypes was variable and ranged from 2 to 100% in 1991 and from 0 to 100% in 1992, but means were statistically similar (F value = 0.2) between years (84% in 1991 and 80% in 1992).

"11","Considering the potential threat of vegetables growing in antibiotic-polluted soil with high abundance of antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) against human health through the food chain, it is thus urgent to develop novel control technology to ensure vegetable safety. In the present work, pot experiments were conducted in lettuce cultivation to assess the impedance effect of biochar amendment on soil sulfonamides (SAs), antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), and ARG enrichment in lettuce tissues. After 100 days of cultivation, lettuce cultivation with biochar amendment exhibited the greatest soil SA dissipation as well as the significant improvement of lettuce growth indices, with residual soil SAs mainly existing as the tightly bound fraction. Moreover, the SA contents in roots and new/old leaves were reduced by one to two orders of magnitude compared to those without biochar amendment. In addition, isolate counts for SA-resistant bacterial endophytes in old leaves and sul gene abundances in roots and old leaves also decreased significantly after biochar application. However, neither SA resistant bacteria nor sul genes were detected in new leaves. It was the first study to demonstrate that biochar amendment can be a practical strategy to protect lettuce safety growing in SA-polluted soil with rich ARB and ARGs. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Ye M.; Sun M.; Feng Y.; Wan J.; Xie S.; Tian D.; Zhao Y.; Wu J.; Hu F.; Li H.; Jiang X.",NA,"",NA,"Ye, Mao (57200130221); Sun, Mingming (36088000900); Feng, Yanfang (54386661100); Wan, Jinzhong (16319864300); Xie, Shanni (56927338200); Tian, Da (56717191800); Zhao, Yu (59050815500); Wu, Jun (57203272581); Hu, Feng (7202526324); Li, Huixin (8542795700); Jiang, Xin (57214068210)",NA,"Effect of biochar amendment on the control of soil sulfonamides, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and gene enrichment in lettuce tissues","Journal of Hazardous Materials",NA,NA,"English","Article",NA,"","","",NA,"ARB; ARGs; Biochar addition; Impedance effect; Lettuce cultivation","Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Charcoal; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Food Contamination; Genes, Bacterial; Lettuce; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants; Sulfonamides; Bacteria (microorganisms); Lactuca; Amides; Antibiotics; Bacteria; Bacteriology; Cultivation; Genes; Health risks; Histology; Soil pollution; Sulfur compounds; Tissue; Vegetables; biochar; charcoal; RNA 16S; sulfonamide; unclassified drug; vegetable protein; antiinfective agent; bacterial RNA; biochar; charcoal; soil pollutant; sulfonamide; Antibiotic-resistant bacteria; Antibiotic-resistant genes; ARGs; Bacterial endophytes; Bio chars; Control technologies; Orders of magnitude; Resistant bacteria; antibiotic resistance; bacterium; charcoal; cultivation; drug; gene; growth rate; leaf; leafy vegetable; residual soil; root system; soil amendment; antibiotic resistant bacteria; antibiotic resistant gene; Article; bacterial gene; bioaccumulation; bound fraction; chemical composition; chlorophyll content; concentration (parameters); controlled study; dry weight; endophyte; endophytic fungus; fresh weight; gene dosage; genetic analysis; lettuce; nonhuman; plant growth; plant leaf; plant root; plant tissue; root growth; soil amendment; soil property; surface area; antibiotic resistance; bacterial gene; bacterium; chemistry; food contamination; genetics; growth, development and aging; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; prevention and control; soil pollutant; Soils","Ye M., State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, China; Sun M., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Feng Y., Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, 210014, China; Wan J., Nanjing Institute of Environmental Science, Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, Nanjing, 210042, China; Xie S., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Tian D., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Zhao Y., Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Photonic and Electronic Materials, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China; Wu J., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Hu F., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Li H., Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Jiang X., State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, China","State Key Laboratory of Soil and Sustainable Agriculture, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, 210008, China; Soil Ecology Lab, College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, Nanjing, 210095, China; Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Nanjing, 210014, China; Nanjing Institute of Environmental Science, Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, Nanjing, 210042, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Photonic and Electronic Materials, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Nanjing University, Nanjing, 210093, China","Y.

"12","The influence of water stress on growth of six isolates of an anamorphic ericoid mycorrhizal fungal endophyte from two Australian Ericaceae hosts was investigated. Biomass production was determined in liquid media amended with NaCl or polyethylene glycol to give osmotic potentials of -0.05 to -2.24 MPa. Regardless of the osmoticum, biomass yields of all isolates at the highest level of imposed water stress (-2.24 MPa) did not differ significantly from, or were significantly higher than, those at the lowest level of water stress. The data suggest that the endophyte isolates possess considerable resistance to water stress and may be of functional importance to their plant hosts under water-stress conditions.","Chen, DM; Khalili, K; Cairney, JWG",NA,NA,NA,"Chen, DM; Khalili, K; Cairney, JWG",NA,"Influence of water stress on biomass production by isolates of an ericoid mycorrhizal endophyte of <i>Woollsia pungens</i> and <i>Epacris microphylla</i> (Ericaceae)","MYCORRHIZA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0940-6360",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2003,13,"3",NA,NA,NA,"173","176",NA,"10.1007/s00572-003-0228-7","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-003-0228-7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,12836087,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000184017500009",NA,7967,"Absence"
"13","Larch sawfly, Pristiphora erichsonii Hartig, and larch needlecast fungus, Mycosphaerella laricinia (R. Hartig) Neg., are early season defoliators restricted only to Larix host trees. Larch defoliation (100%) by either the fungus or insect, but not mechanical removal, induced systemic responses that reduced sawfly consumption and digestion rates one year later. In a feeding behavior assay, larvae quickly abandoned seedlings previously defoliated by M. laricinia. Adult female oviposition choice and egg deposition were unaffected. Seedling growth was not affected during the year of defoliation by M. laricinia, but was significantly reduced one year later. Defoliation by M. laricinia reduced stem volume, radial growth, root biomass and new shoot production. The latter tissue is the only oviposition resource for larch sawfly, and, in contrast, is not influenced by sawfly feeding. We hypothesize that M. laricinia infection may limit larch sawfly populations where both species coexist. However, this reduction is at a substantial net cost to larch productivity.","KRAUSE, SC; RAFFA, KF",NA,NA,NA,"KRAUSE, SC; RAFFA, KF",NA,"COMPARISON OF INSECT, FUNGAL, AND MECHANICALLY INDUCED DEFOLIATION OF LARCH - EFFECTS ON PLANT PRODUCTIVITY AND SUBSEQUENT HOST SUSCEPTIBILITY","OECOLOGIA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0029-8549",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JUN",1992,90,"3",NA,NA,NA,"411","416",NA,"10.1007/BF00317699","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00317699",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28313529,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1992HW29400014",NA,4840,"Absence"
"14","Tropospheric ozone is among the global change factors that pose a threat to plants and microorganisms. Symbiotic microorganisms can assist plants to cope with stress, but their role in the tolerance of plants to ozone is poorly understood. Here, we subjected endophyte-symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants of Lolium multiflorum, an annual species widely distributed in temperate grasslands, to high and low (i.e., charcoal-filtered air) ozone levels at vegetative and reproductive phases. Exposure to high ozone reduced leaf photochemical efficiency and greenness in both symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants. However, ozone-induced oxidative damage at biochemical level (i.e., lipid peroxidation) was mostly detected in symbiotic plants. Ozone exposure at the vegetative phase did not affect the reproductive investment in seeds, indicating full recovery from stress. Ozone exposure at the reproductive phase reduced biomass and seed production only in symbiotic plants indicating a symbiontassociated cost. At low ozone, endophyte-symbiotic plants showed a steeper slope in the relationship between seed number and seed weight (i.e., a number-weight trade-off) compared to non-symbiotic plants. However, when plants were treated at the reproductive phase, ozone increased the imbalance between seed number and seed weight in both endophyte-symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants. Plants with endophytes at the reproductive stage produced fewer seeds, which were not compensated by increased seed weight. Thus, fungal mycelium growing within ovaries or ozone-induced antioxidant systems may result in costs that finally depress the fitness of plants. Despite ozone pollution could destabilize plant-endophyte mutualisms and render them dysfunctional, other endophyte-mediated benefits (e.g., resistance to herbivory, tolerance to drought) could over-compensate these losses and explain the high incidence of the symbiosis in nature.","Ueno, AC; Gundel, PE; Ghersa, CM; Agathokleous, E; Martínez-Ghersa, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Ueno, Andrea C.; Gundel, Pedro E.; Ghersa, Claudio M.; Agathokleous, Evgenios; Alejandra Martinez-Ghersa, M.",NA,"Seed-borne fungal endophytes constrain reproductive success of host plants under ozone pollution","ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Agathokleous, Evgenios/D-2838-2016","Agathokleous, Evgenios/0000-0002-0058-4857",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0013-9351","1096-0953",NA,NA,NA,"NOV",2021,202,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.envres.2021.111773","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2021.111773",NA,"JUL 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,34324850,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000703536100002",NA,9060,"Absence"
"15","Plants have evolved mechanisms to survive herbivory. One such mechanism is the induction of defences upon attack that can operate intergenerationally. Cool-season grasses (sub-family Pooideae) obtain defences via symbiosis with vertically transmitted fungal endophytes (genus Epichloe) and can also show inducible responses. However, it is unknown whether these herbivore-induced responses can have intergenerational effects. We hypothesized that herbivory by aphids on maternal plants induces the intergenerational accumulation of endophyte-derived defensive alkaloids and resistance intensification in the progeny. We subjected mother plants symbiotic or not with Epichloe occultans, a species known for its production of anti-insect alkaloids known as lolines, to the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi. Then, we evaluated the progeny of these plants in terms of loline alkaloid concentration, resistance level (through herbivore performance), and shoot biomass. Herbivory on mother plants did not increase the concentration of lolines in seeds but it tended to affect loline concentration in progeny plants. There was an overall herbivore-induced intergenerational effect increasing the endophyte-conferred defence and resistance. Symbiotic plants were more resistant to aphids and had higher shoot biomass than their non-symbiotic counterparts. Since maternal herbivory did not affect the loline concentrations in seeds, the greater resistance of the progeny could have resulted from an inherited mechanism of epigenetic regulation. It would be interesting to elucidate the origin of this regulation since it could come from the host or the fungal symbiont. Thus, endophyte-driven differential fitness between symbiotic and non-symbiotic plants might be higher as generations pass on in presence of herbivores.","Bustos, LBM; Ueno, AC; Biganzoli, F; Card, SD; Mace, WJ; Martínez-Ghersa, MA; Gundel, PE",NA,NA,NA,"Bubica Bustos, Ludmila M.; Ueno, Andrea C.; Biganzoli, Fernando; Card, Stuart D.; Mace, Wade J.; Martinez-Ghersa, Maria A.; Gundel, Pedro E.",NA,"Can Aphid Herbivory Induce Intergenerational Effects of Endophyte-conferred Resistance in Grasses?","JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013","Card, Stuart/0000-0001-7140-7471; Biganzoli, Fernando/0000-0003-0004-5295; Ueno, Andrea/0000-0002-7853-5270",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0098-0331","1573-1561",NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2022,48,"11-12",NA,NA,NA,"867","881",NA,"10.1007/s10886-022-01390-2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10886-022-01390-2",NA,"NOV 2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,36372818,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000882843500001",NA,6281,"Absence"
"16","Locoweeds are legumes of the Astragalus and Oxytropis genera that live symbiotically with the fungal endosymbionts belonging to Alternaria section Undifilum. These endophytes produce the toxin swainsonine, which causes a neurological syndrome (locosim) when the plant is ingested by grazing animals. Here we characterize the growth of the endophytes within plant tissues using confocal and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to define the physical relationship. Microscopy results revealed the endophyte distribution to be densely networked, with the mycelia aligned parallel to the long axis of the plant stem and with no pathology to plant cell walls, xylem, or phloem. The autofluorescent mycelia were located intercellulary in the pith of stems. Stereofluoroscope observations of Alternaria oxytropis, A. cinerea, and A. fulva in phytoagar showed that mycelial growth occurred at the tip of hyphae. The growth rate of A. cinerea was significantly faster than for A. oxytropis or A. fulva. All three species of endophytes grew significantly faster at 3 days age of culture and grew slowly or not at all after 20 or 30 days. Analyses of the growth of these fungi support the hypothesis that there is a nonpathogenic symbiosis between the fungal endophytes and their host plants.","Noor, AI; Nava, A; Cooke, P; Cook, D; Creamer, R",NA,NA,NA,"Noor, Aziza Ibrahim; Nava, Amy; Cooke, Peter; Cook, Daniel; Creamer, Rebecca",NA,"Evidence for nonpathogenic relationships of <i>Alternaria</i> section <i>Undifilum</i> endophytes within three host locoweed plant species","BOTANY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Nava, Amy/0000-0003-2516-7432",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1916-2790","1916-2804",NA,NA,NA,"MAR",2018,96,"3",NA,NA,NA,"187","200",NA,"10.1139/cjb-2017-0117","http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2017-0117",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000426971600004",NA,4927,"Absence"

"18","Infection of tall fescue with the common toxic fungal endophyte EpichloA << coenophiala harms livestock via toxic alkaloid production; therefore, non-toxic 'novel' strains of the endophyte have been developed and released. How different endophyte strains impact biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) in mixed species pastures is unknown. We asked whether novel endophyte or common toxic endophyte-infected (NE+; CTE+) tall fescue affects symbiotic and non-symbiotic BNF, and utilization of biologically-fixed nitrogen in tall fescue. Tall fescue was planted either endophyte-free (E-), infected with CTE, two non-toxic strains AR542 NE, AR584 NE, or a blend of endophyte treatments. We measured natural abundance of (15) N in plant and soil samples, and conducted soil acetylene reduction assays. Endophyte presence and strain significantly affected the delta N-15 of tall fescue. Near red clover, CTE+ and AR584 NE+ tall fescue were most (15) N-depleted; but away, E- tall fescue was most (15) N-depleted. Endophyte strain significantly influenced N concentration in red clover, but not symbiotic or non-symbiotic BNF. Endophyte strains produce different effects on tall fescue's competitive ability and nitrogen utilization. In mixed pastures, deployment of NE strains for decreased alkaloid toxicity will differentially impact use of biologically fixed nitrogen in tall fescue and nitrogen concentration in red clover.","Slaughter, LC; Carlisle, AE; Nelson, JA; McCulley, RL",NA,NA,NA,"Slaughter, Lindsey C.; Carlisle, Anna E.; Nelson, Jim A.; McCulley, Rebecca L.",NA,"Fungal endophyte symbiosis alters nitrogen source of tall fescue host, but not nitrogen fixation in co-occurring red clover","PLANT AND SOIL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Slaughter, Lindsey/AAA-5600-2020","Slaughter, Lindsey/0000-0002-9918-6209",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0032-079X","1573-5036",NA,NA,NA,"AUG",2016,405,"1-2",NA,NA,NA,"243","256",NA,"10.1007/s11104-015-2510-9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11104-015-2510-9",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000381210800018",NA,4636,"Absence"
"19","Neotyphodium endophytic fungi, the asexual state of Epichloe species, protect cool-season grasses against stresses. The outcomes of Neotyphodium-grass symbioses are agronomically relevant as they may affect the productivity of pastures. It has been suggested that the mutualism is characteristic of agronomic grasses and that differential rates of gene flow between both partners' populations are expected to disrupt the specificity of the association and, thus, the mutualism in wild grasses. We propose that compatibility is necessary but not sufficient to explain the outcomes of Neotyphodium-grass symbiosis, and advance a model that links genetic compatibility, mutualism effectiveness, and endophyte transmission efficiency. For endophytes that reproduce clonally and depend on allogamous hosts for reproduction and dissemination, we propose that this symbiosis works as an integrated entity where gene flow promotes its fitness and evolution. Compatibility between the host plant and the fungal endophyte would be high in genetically close parents; however, mutualism effectiveness and transmission efficiency would be low in fitness depressed host plants. Increasing the genetic distance of mating parents would increase mutualism effectiveness and transmission efficiency. This tendency would be broken when the genetic distance between parents is high (out-breeding depression). Our model allows for testable hypotheses that would contribute to understand the coevolutionary origin and future of the endophyte-grass mutualism.","Gundel, PE; Omacini, M; Sadras, VO; Ghersa, CM",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro E.; Omacini, Marina; Sadras, Victor O.; Ghersa, Claudio M.",NA,"The interplay between the effectiveness of the grass-endophyte mutualism and the genetic variability of the host plant","EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Sadras, Victor/D-5122-2013","Sadras, Victor/0000-0002-5874-6775; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Omacini, Marina/0000-0003-1460-262X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1752-4571",NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2010,3,"5-6",NA,NA,NA,"538","546",NA,"10.1111/j.1752-4571.2010.00152.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-4571.2010.00152.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,25567945,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000281311700012",NA,5433,"Absence"
"20","In the Pacific Northwest, AInus rubra Bong. (red alder) is a common deciduous tree species especially prevalent in riparian corridors and disturbed sites, including metropolitan areas undergoing land use changes and development. Importantly, red alder is also considered a bioindicator for ozone pollution and, like all plants, harbors a diverse endophyte community that may interact with aerial pollutants. In this study, we surveyed foliar fungal endophyte communities (microfungi) in red alder leaves from the metropolitan area of Portland, Oregon, USA, using culture-based techniques, and found that communities differed significantly by site. Our results suggest that the fungal endophyte community composition in red alder leaves may be influenced in part by local air pollution sources, likely in conjunction with other site characteristics. As urban areas expand, more studies should focus on how the urban environment affects plant-microbe community ecology and endophyte-host interactions, as well as on the long-term consequences for other ecosystem processes such as leaf litter decomposition.","Wolfe, ER; Kautz, S; Singleton, SL; Ballhorn, DJ",NA,NA,NA,"Wolfe, Emily R.; Kautz, Stefanie; Singleton, Sebastian L.; Ballhorn, Daniel J.",NA,"Differences in foliar endophyte communities of red alder (<i>Alnus rubra</i>) exposed to varying air pollutant levels","BOTANY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wolfe, Emily/0000-0003-1808-7012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1916-2790","1916-2804",NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2018,96,"12",NA,NA,NA,"825","835",NA,"10.1139/cjb-2018-0085","http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/cjb-2018-0085",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000451221000002",NA,4410,"Absence"

"23","The true myrtle, Myrtus communis, is a small perennial evergreen tree that occurs in Europe, Africa, and Asia with a circum-Mediterranean geographic distribution. Unfortunately, the Mediterranean Forests, where M. communis occurs, are critically endangered and are currently restricted to small fragmented areas in protected conservation units. In the present work, we performed, for the first time, a metabarcoding study on the spatial variation of fungal community structure in the foliar endophytome of this endemic plant of the Mediterranean biome, using bipartite network analysis as a model. The local bipartite network of Myrtus communis individuals and their foliar endophytic fungi is very low connected, with low nestedness, and moderately high specialization and modularity. Similar network patterns were also retrieved in both culture-dependent and amplicon metagenomics of foliar endophytes in distinct arboreal hosts in varied biomes. Furthermore, the majority of putative fungal endophytes species were basidiomycete woody saprotrophs of the orders Polyporales, Agaricales, and Hymenochaetales. Altogether, these findings suggest a possible adaptation of these wood-decaying fungi to cope with moisture limitation and spatial scarcity of their primary substrate (dead wood), which are totally consistent with the predictions of the viaphytism hypothesis that wood-decomposing fungi inhabit the internal leaf tissue of forest trees in order to enhance dispersal to substrates on the forest floor, by using leaves as vectors and as refugia, during periods of environmental stress.","Vaz, ABM; Fonseca, PLC; Silva, FF; Quintanilha-Peixoto, G; Sampedro, I; Siles, JA; Carmo, A; Kato, RB; Azevedo, V; Badotti, F; Ocampo, JA; Rosa, CA; Góes-Neto, A",NA,NA,NA,"Vaz, Aline Bruna M.; Fonseca, Paula Luize C.; Silva, Felipe F.; Quintanilha-Peixoto, Gabriel; Sampedro, Inmaculada; Siles, Jose A.; Carmo, Anderson; Kato, Rodrigo B.; Azevedo, Vasco; Badotti, Fernanda; Ocampo, Juan A.; Rosa, Carlos A.; Goes-Neto, Aristoteles",NA,"Foliar mycoendophytome of an endemic plant of the Mediterranean biome <i>(Myrtus communis</i>) reveals the dominance of basidiomycete woody saprotrophs","PEERJ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ocampo, Juan/K-7565-2014; Vaz, Aline/F-7684-2012; Carmo, Anderson/E-6427-2016; Goes-Neto, Aristoteles/A-6955-2013; Fonseca, Paula/AAL-8690-2020; Azevedo, Vasco/B-1556-2019; vasco, azevedo/F-4315-2011; Badotti, Fernanda/G-8556-2017; Kato, Rodrigo/Q-2242-2017; Siles, Jose A./A-7043-2019","Oliveira do Carmo, Anderson/0000-0003-4646-513X; Rosa, Carlos/0000-0002-0056-9075; Quintanilha-Peixoto, Gabriel/0000-0002-7476-5845; vasco, azevedo/0000-0002-4775-2280; Badotti, Fernanda/0000-0001-9038-4631; Kato, Rodrigo/0000-0002-9046-1702; Vaz, Aline/0000-0002-3167-6308; Fonseca, Paula/0000-0002-8103-9235; Siles, Jose A./0000-0002-5850-0281",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2167-8359",NA,NA,NA,NA,"DEC 3",2020,8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.7717/peerj.10487","http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10487",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,33344092,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000595237000007",NA,8493,"Absence"

We developed a multiplex metabarcoding method for the identification of fungal phytopathogens and endophytes in olive young shoots, using the MinION sequencing platform (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Selected fungal-specific primers were used to amplify three different genomic DNA loci (ITS, beta-tubulin, and 28S LSU) originating from olive twigs. A multiplex metabarcoding approach was initially evaluated using healthy olive twigs, and further assessed with naturally infected olive twig samples. Bioinformatic analysis of basecalled reads was carried out using MinKNOW, BLAST+ and R programming, and results were also evaluated using the BugSeq cloud platform. Data analysis highlighted the approaches based on ITS and their combination with beta-tubulin as the most informative ones according to diversity estimations.

"26","Molecular phylogeny has resolved the liverworts as the earliest-divergent clade of land plants and mosses as the sister group to hornworts plus tracheophytes, with alternative topologies resolving the hornworts as sister to mosses plus tracheophytes less well supported. The tracheophytes plus fossil plants putatively lacking lignified vascular tissue form the polysporangiophyte clade. This paper reviews phylogenetic, developmental, anatomical, genetic and paleontological data with the aim of reconstructing the succession of events that shaped major land plant lineages. Fundamental land plant characters primarily evolved in the bryophyte grade, and hence the key to a better understanding of the early evolution of land plants is in bryophytes. The last common ancestor of land plants was probably a leafless axial gametophyte bearing simple unisporangiate sporophytes. Water-conducting tissue, if present, was restricted to the gametophyte and presumably consisted of perforate cells similar to those in the early-divergent bryophytes Haplomitrium and Takakia. Stomata were a sporophyte innovation with the possible ancestral functions of producing a transpiration-driven flow of water and solutes from the parental gametophyte and facilitating spore separation before release. Stomata in mosses, hornworts and polysporangiophytes are viewed as homologous, and hence these three lineages are collectively referred to as the ostomatophytes'. An indeterminate sporophyte body (the sporophyte shoot) developing from an apical meristem was the key innovation in polysporangiophytes. Poikilohydry is the ancestral condition in land plants; homoiohydry evolved in the sporophyte of polysporangiophytes. Fungal symbiotic associations ancestral to modern arbuscular mycorrhizas evolved in the gametophytic generation before the separation of major present-living lineages. Hydroids are imperforate water-conducting cells specific to advanced mosses. Xylem vascular cells in polysporangiophytes arose either from perforate cells or de novo. Food-conducting cells were a very early innovation in land plant evolution. The inferences presented here await testing by molecular genetics.","Ligrone, R; Duckett, JG; Renzaglia, KS",NA,NA,NA,"Ligrone, Roberto; Duckett, Jeffrey G.; Renzaglia, Karen S.",NA,"Major transitions in the evolution of early land plants: a bryological perspective","ANNALS OF BOTANY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ligrone, Roberto/GVU-6415-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0305-7364","1095-8290",NA,NA,NA,"APR",2012,109,"5",NA,NA,NA,"851","871",NA,"10.1093/aob/mcs017","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcs017",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,22356739,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000301971900005",NA,5264,"Absence"

"29","Orchids are critically dependent on fungi for seedling establishment and growth, so the distribution and diversity of orchids might depend on the associated fungal communities. We characterised the communities associated with eight orchid species in three Mediterranean protected areas, using a combination of above-ground analyses of sporophores and below-ground molecular analyses of orchid root samples. In three years of sporophore collection in 25 plots around flowering orchid plants, 268 macrofungal species belonging to 84 genera were observed. Statistical analyses indicated a correlation between macrofungal diversity and orchid community variation, regardless of the effect of environmental and spatial factors characterizing the investigated orchid sites. Fungal ITS-DNA PCR amplification, cloning, and sequencing revealed Rhizoctonia-like fungi belonging to Ceratobasidiaceae (26 %), Tulasnellaceae (22.5 %), and Sebacinaceae (3.5 %), as well as other basidiomycetes and ascomycetes, in the roots of 99 orchid plants. Mycorrhizal specificity was low but co-occurring orchid species showed preferences for diffeent partners. The diverse macrofungal communities found in the sites may contribute to orchid community variation without colonizing the orchid roots. Molecular analyses revealed a segregation of associated fungi, which may contribute to Mediterranean orchid coexistence in nature. © 2018 International Mycological Association.","Pecoraro L.; Caruso T.; Cai L.; Gupta V.K.; Liu Z.-J.",NA,"",NA,"Pecoraro, Lorenzo (54898762400); Caruso, Tancredi (7003382204); Cai, Lei (55653935100); Gupta, Vijai Kumar (36158104300); Liu, Zhong-Jian (56101469900)",NA,"Fungal networks and orchid distribution: New insights from above- and below-ground analyses of fungal communities","IMA Fungus",NA,NA,"English","Article",NA,"","","",NA,"Endophytic fungi; Macrofungal communities; Mediterranean; Molecular ecology; Mycorrhizas; Orchid-fungus relationships; Spatial distributionSpecies coexistence","","Pecoraro L., Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Orchid Conservation and Utilization, The National Orchid Conservation Center of China and The Orchid Conservation and Research Center of Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518114, China, Center for Biotechnology and oBioMedicine and Division of Life and Health Sciences, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, 518055, China, State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; Caruso T., School of Biological Sciences, Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland, BT9 7BL, United Kingdom; Cai L., State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; Gupta V.K., Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, ERA Chair of Green Chemistry, School of Science, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, 12618, Estonia; Liu Z.-J., Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Orchid Conservation and Utilization, The National Orchid Conservation Center of China and The Orchid Conservation and Research Center of Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518114, China","Shenzhen Key Laboratory for Orchid Conservation and Utilization, The National Orchid Conservation Center of China and The Orchid Conservation and Research Center of Shenzhen, Shenzhen, 518114, China; Center for Biotechnology and oBioMedicine and Division of Life and Health Sciences, Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, 518055, China; State Key Laboratory of Mycology, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; School of Biological Sciences, Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, Northern Ireland, BT9 7BL, United Kingdom; Department of Chemistry and Biotechnology, ERA Chair of Green Chemistry, School of Science, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn, 12618, Estonia","L.

"30","Many wild and cultivated cool-season grass species are naturally infected with fungal endophytes of the genera Neotyphodium and Epichloë. These associations generally are considered mutualistic with the plants benefiting from reduced herbivory and the fungi benefiting from nutrients supplied by the plants. The fungi secrete proteins that might have a role in the interspecies symbiosis. In the interaction between Poa ampla Merr. and the endophyte Neotyphodium sp., a fungal chitinase was detected in the apoplastic protein fraction. The chitinase was also the major protein secreted in culture. Sequence analysis of the chitinase revealed it has a low level of amino acid sequence identity to other fungal chitinases and one of the conserved active site residues is altered. DNA gel-blot analysis indicated the chitinase was encoded by a single gene. Expression of similar chitinases also was detected in endophyte-infected tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and Chewings fescue (Festuca rubra L. subsp. fallax [Thuill] Nyman). This is the first report of an endophyte chitinase expressed in the infected host grass. As a secreted hydrolytic enzyme, the chitinase might have roles in the nutrition, growth or defense of the endophyte.","Li H.M.; Sullivan R.; Moy M.; Kobayashi D.Y.; Belanger F.C.",NA,"",NA,"Li, Huaijun Michael (8357940300); Sullivan, Ray (7402484928); Moy, Melinda (7004691671); Kobayashi, Donald Y.

"31","Fungal endophytes are diverse and widespread symbionts that occur in the living tissues of all lineages of plants without causing evidence of disease. Culture-based and culture-free studies indicate that they often are abundant in the leaves of woody angiosperms, but only a few studies have visualized endophytic fungi in leaf tissues, and the process through which most endophytes colonize leaves has not been studied thoroughly. We inoculated leaf discs and the living leaves of a model woody angiosperm, Populus trichocarpa, which has endophytes that represent three distantly-related genera (Cladosporium, Penicillium, and Trichoderma). We used scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy to evaluate the timeline and processes by which they colonize leaf tissue. Under laboratory conditions with high humidity, conidia germinated on leaf discs to yield hyphae that grew epiphytically and incidentally entered stomata, but did not grow in a directed fashion toward stomatal openings. No cuticular penetration was observed. The endophytes readily colonized the interiors of leaf discs that were detached from living leaves, and could be visualized within discs with light microscopy. Although they were difficult to visualize within the interior of living leaves following in vivo inoculations, standard methods for isolating foliar endophytes confirmed their presence.","Huang, YL; Zimmerman, NB; Arnold, AE",NA,NA,NA,"Huang, Yu-Ling; Zimmerman, Naupaka B.; Arnold, A.

"32","VelA (or VeA) is a key global regulator in fungal secondary metabolism and development which we previously showed is required during the symbiotic interaction of Epichloe festucae with perennial ryegrass. In this study, comparative transcriptomic analyses of increment velA mutant compared to wild-type E. festucae, under three different conditions (in culture, infected seedlings, and infected mature plants), were performed to investigate the impact of VelA on E. festucae transcriptome. These comparative transcriptomic studies showed that VelA regulates the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in membrane transport, fungal cell wall biosynthesis, host cell wall degradation, and secondary metabolism, along with a number of small secreted proteins and a large number of proteins with no predictable functions. In addition, these results were compared with previous transcriptomic experiments that studied the impact of LaeA, another key global regulator of secondary metabolism and development that we have shown is important for E. festucae-perennial ryegrass interaction. The results showed that although VelA and LaeA regulate a subset of E. festucae genes in a similar manner, they also regulated many other genes independently of each other suggesting specialised roles.","Rahnama, M; Maclean, P; Fleetwood, DJ; Johnson, RD",NA,NA,NA,"Rahnama, Mostafa; Maclean, Paul; Fleetwood, Damien J.; Johnson, Richard D.",NA,"VelA and LaeA are Key Regulators of <i>Epichloe festucae</i> Transcriptomic Response during Symbiosis with Perennial Ryegrass","MICROORGANISMS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Johnson, Richard/0000-0003-2100-6658; Maclean, Paul/0000-0001-8898-8276; Rahnama, Mostafa/0000-0002-3429-4479",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2076-2607",NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2020,8,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/microorganisms8010033","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms8010033",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,31878026,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000514650700135",NA,9303,"Absence"
"33","Aegagropiles are conglomerations of fibre debris from Posidonia oceanica meadows that are frequently found along Mediterranean beaches, but the plant organ from which these fibres arise remains unknown. In this study, a histological comparison of P. oceanica organs from 3 shoots with the structure of aegagropile fibres showed that most of them arise from leaf sheaths and rhizomes, suggesting that they are degradation products from the ""matte"" rather than from the leaf litter, which is mainly composed of detached leaf blades. Moreover, fungal hyphae, micro-sclerotia and typical degradation traces were found in the peripheral tissues of living P. oceanica organs, as well as in degrading aegagropiles. We assume, by comparing Vohnik's observations and the observations made in this study, that these endophytic fungi and degradation traces might be attributed to a dark septate endophyte (DSE) in the Aigialaceae (Pleosporales), Posidoniomyces atricolor, which was recently described as an endosymbiont in P. oceanica roots. It constitutes one of the most important microorganisms by abundance that degrade P. oceanica tissues within the matte and give rise to the different fibre types in aegagropiles. This study shows that the proliferation of fungi causes organ degradation in Posidonia, starting early in living P. oceanica plants, continuing in the matte and, probably, in the leaf litter. The DSE plays a much more important role than that of a simple plant endosymbiont; its omnipresence within P. oceanica (and the degradation of the middle lamella and cell death during proliferation) causing the degradation of various Posidonia organs also contributes to the enrichment of the 'matte' compartment of this ecosystem, notably favouring nitrogen retention in its chitinous walls.","Lefebvre, L; Compère, P; Gobert, S",NA,NA,NA,"Lefebvre, Laurence; Compere, Philippe; Gobert, Sylvie",NA,"The formation of aegagropiles from the Mediterranean seagrass <i>Posidonia oceanica</i> (L.)

In our experiment, we released viruliferous aphid vectors on endophyte-infected and endophyte-free plants in a common garden.

"35","Biotrophic fungal plant pathogens can balance their virulence and form intricate relationships with their hosts. Sometimes, this leads to systemic host colonization over long time scales without macroscopic symptoms. However, how plant-pathogenic endophytes manage to establish their sustained systemic infection remains largely unknown. Here, we present a genomic and transcriptomic analysis of Thecaphora thlaspeos. This relative of the well studied grass smut Ustilago maydis is the only smut fungus adapted to Brassicaceae hosts. Its ability to overwinter with perennial hosts and its systemic plant infection including roots are unique characteristics among smut fungi. The T. thlaspeos genome was assembled to the chromosome level. It is a typical smut genome in terms of size and genome characteristics. In silico prediction of candidate effector genes revealed common smut effector proteins and unique members. For three candidates, we have functionally demonstrated effector activity. One of these, TtTue1, suggests a potential link to cold acclimation. On the plant side, we found evidence for a typical immune response as it is present in other infection systems, despite the absence of any macroscopic symptoms during infection. Our findings suggest that T. thlaspeos distinctly balances its virulence during biotrophic growth ultimately allowing for long-lived infection of its perennial hosts.","Courville, KJ; Frantzeskakis, L; Gul, S; Haeger, N; Kellner, R; Hessler, N; Day, B; Usadel, B; Gupta, YK; van Esse, HP; Brachmann, A; Kemen, E; Feldbrügge, M; Göhre, V",NA,NA,NA,"Courville, Kaitlyn J.; Frantzeskakis, Lamprinos; Gul, Summia; Haeger, Natalie; Kellner, Ronny; Hessler, Natascha; Day, Brad; Usadel, Bjoern; Gupta, Yogesh K.; van Esse, H.

"36","The detection of beneficial microbes living within perennial ryegrass seed causing no apparent defects is challenging, even with the most sensitive and conventional methods, such as DNA genotyping. Using a near-infrared hyperspectral imaging system (NIR-HSI), we were able to discriminate not only the presence of the commercial NEA12 fungal endophyte strain but perennial ryegrass cultivars of diverse seed age and batch. A total of 288 wavebands were extracted for individual seeds from hyperspectral images. The optimal pre-processing methods investigated yielded the best partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) classification model to discriminate NEA12 and without endophyte (WE) perennial ryegrass seed with a classification accuracy of 89%. Effective wavelength (EW) selection based on GA-PLS-DA resulted in the selection of 75 wavebands yielding 88.3% discrimination accuracy using PLS-DA. For cultivar identification, the artificial neural network discriminant analysis (ANN-DA) was the best-performing classification model, resulting in >90% classification accuracy for Trojan, Alto, Rohan, Governor and Bronsyn. EW selection using GA-PLS-DA resulted in 87 wavebands, and the PLS-DA model performed the best, with no extensive compromise in performance, resulting in >89.1% accuracy. The study demonstrates the use of NIR-HSI reflectance data to discriminate, for the first time, an associated beneficial fungal endophyte and five cultivars of perennial ryegrass seed, irrespective of seed age and batch. Furthermore, the negligible effects on the classification errors using EW selection improve the capability and deployment of optimized methods for real-time analysis, such as the use of low-cost multispectral sensors for single seed analysis and automated seed sorting devices. © 2023 by the authors.","Reddy P.; Panozzo J.; Guthridge K.M.; Spangenberg G.C.; Rochfort S.J.",NA,"",NA,"Reddy, Priyanka (57204704237); Panozzo, Joe (6603689693); Guthridge, Kathryn M.

"37","Achnatherum inebrians (drunken horse grass, DHG) plants, a dominant grass species in the arid and semi-arid regions of northwest China, symbiotic with an Epichloe fungal endophyte, is well adapted to drought. However, little is known about how the presence of the foliar Epichloe endophyte enhances the tolerance of DHG to drought at the molecular level. This study explored the positive effects of the presence of the Epichloe endophyte on plant growth, biomass, and photosynthetic efficiency and processes of DHG under non-drought and two drought (moderate and severe) treatments, using RNA sequencing to compare transcriptomes. The transcriptome results showed that 32 selected unigenes involved in the photosynthesis processes within Epichloe symbiotic plants were differently expressed (DEGs) versus non-symbiotic plants. The majority of these selected DEGs were upregulated in Epichloe symbiotic plants versus non-symbiotic plants, such as upregulated unigenes (c51525.graph_c1, c47798.graph_c0 & c64087.graph_c0) under drought conditions. In line with the transcriptomes data, the presence of the Epichloe endophyte promoted the photosynthetic rate and biomass accumulation of DHG plants, and the relationship between the photosynthetic rate and biomass is linear and significant. The presence of the endophyte only increased the biomass per tiller of DHG plants under drought. This study provides further insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie the enhanced plant growth and drought tolerance of Epichloe-symbiotic DHG plants.","Zhong, R; Bastías, DA; Zhang, XX; Li, CJ; Nan, ZB",NA,NA,NA,"Zhong, Rui; Bastias, Daniel A.; Zhang, Xingxu; Li, Chunjie; Nan, Zhibiao",NA,"Vertically Transmitted <i>Epichlo</i><i>e</i> Systemic Endophyte Enhances Drought Tolerance of <i>Achnatherum inebrians</i> Host Plants through Promoting Photosynthesis and Biomass Accumulation","JOURNAL OF FUNGI",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zhang, Xingxu/AAX-7502-2021; Bastias, Daniel/AFN-3093-2022; Li, Chunjie/G-4988-2012",", Xingxu/0000-0002-5131-7919; Li, Chunjie/0000-0002-3287-2140; Bastias, Daniel A./0000-0002-0522-5538",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2309-608X",NA,NA,NA,"MAY",2022,8,"5",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/jof8050512","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof8050512",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35628767,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000803378100001",NA,461,"Absence"
"38","Effects of a fungal endophyte, Fusarium mairei, on growth and paclitaxel formation of Taxus cuspidata cells were investigated by adding fungal endophyte culture supernatant (FECS) to suspension cultures of T. cuspidata cells. The main effective chemical responsible for paclitaxel formation in FECS was an exopolysaccharide (EPS) of molecular weight similar to 2 kDa. FECS fractions except EPS stimulated growth of Taxus cells but had no effects on paclitaxel accumulation. Additionally, elicitation efficiency of FECS based on different culture conditions was studied. EPS content in FECS was related to FECS culture conditions. FECS with long cultivation and high-aeration cultivation contained higher EPS content and resulted in higher paclitaxel yield than that with short cultivation and low-aeration cultivation. The maximum yield of paclitaxel from Taxus cultures, elicited by FECS with 9-day cultivation, was 4.7-fold that of the control cultures.","Li, YC; Tao, WY",NA,NA,NA,"Li, Yong-Cheng; Tao, Wen-Yi",NA,"Effects of paclitaxel-producing fungal endophytes on growth and paclitaxel formation of <i>Taxus cuspidata</i> cells","PLANT GROWTH REGULATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0167-6903","1573-5087",NA,NA,NA,"MAY",2009,58,"1",NA,NA,NA,"97","105",NA,"10.1007/s10725-008-9355-7","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-008-9355-7",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000264842400009",NA,2249,"Absence"
"39","Fungal endophytes comprise a highly diverse group of particular interest for their relevant implications to the ecosystems they inhabit. The objective of this study was to infer the phylogenetic affinity between strains of Peroneutypa scoparia exhibiting different lifestyles to elucidate possible shifts in ecological roles. Specimens and living cultures used in the present study were obtained from decaying wood and from live stem tissues of the invasive host species Broussonetia papyrifera. The similarity between the fungal strains was studied through molecular analyses. The results showed a close phylogenetic link and high genetic similarity between endophytic and saprotrophic strains. The main findings suggest that P. scoparia has primary access to the substrate as an endophyte and then this organism may change its use of the available resources presenting a saprotrophic growth. These results provide valuable information about the roles that diatrypaceous fungi play as endophytes or as decaying wood inhabitants and contributes to evaluate the ecological significance of this group.

"40","Wheat dwarf bunt leads to the replacement of seeds with fungal galls containing millions of teliospores of the pathogen Tilletia controversa Kühn. As one of the most devastating internationally quarantined wheat diseases, wheat dwarf bunt spreads to cause distant outbreaks by seeds containing teliospores. In this study, based on a combination of amplicon sequencing and isolation approaches, we analyzed the seed microbiome signatures of endophytes between resistant and susceptible cultivars after infection with T. controversa. Among 310 bacterial species obtained only by amplicon sequencing and 51 species obtained only by isolation, we found 14 overlapping species by both methods; we detected 128 fungal species only by amplicon sequencing, 56 only by isolation, and 5 species by both methods. The results indicated that resistant uninfected cultivars hosted endophytic communities that were much more stable and beneficial to plant health than those in susceptible infected cultivars. The susceptible group showed higher diversity than the resistant group, the infected group showed more diversity than the uninfected group, and the microbial communities in seeds were related to infection or resistance to the pathogen. Some antagonistic microbes significantly suppressed the germination rate of the pathogen’s teliospores, providing clues for future studies aimed at developing strategies against wheat dwarf bunt. Collectively, this research advances the understanding of the microbial assembly of wheat seeds upon exposure to fungal pathogen (T. controversa) infection.

"41","Epichloe species form agriculturally important symbioses with many cool season grasses. To study these symbioses, such as the interaction of Epichloe festucae with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), host plants can be infected by artificial inoculation of etiolated seedlings. This inoculation is performed by placing mycelium into an incision in the meristem, as previously described by Latch and Christensen (1985). In recent years, this method has been broadly used to study this interaction at the molecular level using different Epichloe festucae mutants that can cause incompatible interactions. We have developed and adapted methods to study four of the most important host plant responses to infection, including cell death, callose deposition, lignin production, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production, which are useful in defining the host response to infection at a very early time point.","Rahnama, M; Fleetwood, DJ; Johnson, RD",NA,NA,NA,"Rahnama, Mostafa; Fleetwood, Damien J.; Johnson, Richard D.",NA,"Histological Methods to Detect Early-stage Plant Defense Responses during Artificial Inoculation of <i>Lolium perenne</i> with <i>Epichloe festucae</i>","BIO-PROTOCOL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rahnama, Mostafa/AAE-2156-2019","Rahnama, Mostafa/0000-0002-3429-4479",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2331-8325",NA,NA,NA,"MAY 5",2021,11,"9",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.21769/BioProtoc.4013","http://dx.doi.org/10.21769/BioProtoc.4013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34124312,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000648705600013",NA,3234,"Absence"
"42","Fungal endophytes of some cultivated grasses can increase plant performance and competitive abilities, especially under stress. Far less is known about the influence of Epichloë infections in wild populations of wild grasses. In this study, plants of three Elymus dahuricus ecotypes (WLS, QY and WTS) either infected with Epichloë endophyte (E+) or uninfected (E-) were grown in the field. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, peroxidase and superoxide dismutase, and concentrations of H2O2 and malondialdehyde were examined in the leaves of E+ and E-plants. We also determined photosynthesis parameters, leaf blade and sheath carbohydrate concentration and plant growth parameters of both E+ and E-plants. E+ plants from the WLS and QYpopulations had significantly higher antioxidant enzyme activities and photosynthetic capability (P<0.05), superior growth characteristics including more abundant carbohydrate concentration than E-plants. In contrast, in plants from the WTS population, the endophyte had no significant effect on reactive oxygen species scavenging capability and growth performance (P>0.05), and even displayed some negative effects on plant photosynthetic capability. Thus, endophyte infection significantly affected E. dahuricus antioxidant enzyme activities (P<0.05), photosynthesis and growth capability, although, the effects varied with plant ecotypes. © The Author(s) 2018.","Zhang Y.; Zhou Y.; Zhang X.; Duan T.; Nan Z.",NA,"",NA,"Zhang, Yuping (59292528600); Zhou, Yanfei (56079884900); Zhang, Xingxu (7410279955); Duan, Tingyu (36494079100); Nan, Zhibiao (55606321600)",NA,"Effects of Epichloë endophyte on antioxidant enzymes activities, photosynthesis and growth of three ecotypes of Elymus dahuricus","Frontiers of Agricultural Science and Engineering",NA,NA,"English","Article",NA,"","","",NA,"Antioxidant enzymes; Elymus dahuricus; Epichloë; Fungal endophyte; Photosynthesis","","Zhang Y., State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, College of Pastoral Agricultural Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, China; Zhou Y., State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, College of Pastoral Agricultural Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, China; Zhang X., State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, College of Pastoral Agricultural Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, China; Duan T., State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, College of Pastoral Agricultural Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, China; Nan Z., State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, College of Pastoral Agricultural Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, China","State Key Laboratory of Grassland Agro-Ecosystem, College of Pastoral Agricultural Science and Technology, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730000, China","Z.

"45","Facultative fungal endophytes are unspecialized plant-associated fungi capable of colonizing plant tissues without causing symptoms of disease. Studies suggest facultative fungal endophytes enhance cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) plant defense against insect herbivores and might alter emissions of volatile organic compounds. We tested for changes in emissions of volatile organic compounds using cotton plants treated with facultative fungal endophtytes Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo-Crivelli) Vuillemin strain GHA and Phialemonium inflatum (Burnside) strain TAMU490 in the presence and absence of herbivory. Solid-phase micro-extraction was used to sample static headspace of individual leaves in collection chambers designed specifically for the experiment. Relative abundance of volatile organic compounds was significantly affected by herbivory, but differences caused by treatment with B. bassiana or P. inflatum were not significant. Findings showed our sampling method can be used to assess constitutive and herbivore-induced volatile organic compound profiles from individual leaves, but further studies need to investigate mechanisms underlying facultative fungal endophyte-mediated herbivore resistance in cotton.","Gale, CC; Suh, CPC; Perez, J; Lesne, P; Wilson, C; Kramer, Z; Madamba, C; Sword, GA",NA,NA,NA,"Gale, Cody C.; Suh, Charles P-C; Perez, Jose; Lesne, Pierre; Wilson, Caroline; Kramer, Zoey; Madamba, Christine; Sword, Gregory A.",NA,"Sampling Volatile Organic Compounds from Individual Cotton Leaves to Test Effects of Fungal Endophyte Treatments","SOUTHWESTERN ENTOMOLOGIST",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Pérez-Naranjo, José/JFT-1427-2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0147-1724","2162-2647",NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2021,46,"2",NA,NA,NA,"299","304",NA,"10.3958/059.046.0201","http://dx.doi.org/10.3958/059.046.0201",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000668593900001",NA,3352,"Absence"
"46","Fusarium head blight (FHB), a fungal disease caused by Fusarium species that produce food toxins, currently devastates wheat production worldwide, yet few resistance resources have been discovered in wheat germplasm. Here, we cloned the FHB resistance gene Fhb7 by assembling the genome of Thinopyrum elongatum, a species used in wheat distant hybridization breeding. Fhb7 encodes a glutathione S-transferase (GST) and confers broad resistance to Fusarium species by detoxifying trichothecenes through de-epoxidation. Fhb7 GST homologs are absent in plants, and our evidence supports that Th. elongatum has gained Fhb7 through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from an endophytic Epichloë species. Fhb7 introgressions in wheat confers resistance to both FHB and crown rot in diverse wheat backgrounds without yield penalty, providing a solution for Fusarium resistance breeding. © 2020 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

"48","Experimental tests of community assembly mechanisms for host-associated microbiomes in nature are lacking. Asymptomatic foliar fungal endophytes are a major component of the plant microbiome and are increasingly recognized for their impacts on plant performance, including pathogen defense, hormonal manipulation, and drought tolerance. However, it remains unclear whether fungal endophytes preferentially colonize certain host ecotypes or genotypes, reflecting some degree of biotic adaptation in the symbioses, or whether colonization is simply a function of spore type and abundance within the local environment. Whether host ecotype, local environment, or some combination of both controls the pattern of microbiome formation across hosts represents a new dimension to the age-old debate of nature versus nurture. Here, we used a reciprocal transplant design to explore the extent of host specificity and biotic adaptation in the plant microbiome, as evidenced by differential colonization of host genetic types by endophytes. Specifically, replicate plants from three locally-adapted ecotypes of the native grass Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) were transplanted at three geographically distinct field sites (one home and two away) in the Midwestern US. At the end of the growing season, plant leaves were harvested and the fungal microbiome characterized using culture-dependent sequencing techniques. Our results demonstrated that fungal endophyte community structure was determined by local environment (i.e., site), but not by host ecotype. Fungal richness and diversity also strongly differed by site, with lower fungal diversity at a riparian field site, whereas host ecotype had no effect. By contrast, there were significant differences in plant phenotypes across all ecotypes and sites, indicating ecotypic differentiation of host phenotype. Overall, our results indicate that environmental factors are the primary drivers of community structure in the switchgrass fungal microbiome.","Whitaker, BK; Reynolds, HL; Clay, K",NA,NA,NA,"Whitaker, Briana K.; Reynolds, Heather L.; Clay, Keith",NA,"Foliar fungal endophyte communities are structured by environment but not host ecotype in <i>Panicum virgatum</i> (switchgrass)","ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Whitaker, Briana/AGH-6130-2022","Whitaker, Briana/0000-0003-2522-9672",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0012-9658","1939-9170",NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2018,99,"12",NA,NA,NA,"2703","2711",NA,"10.1002/ecy.2543","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecy.2543",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30367461,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000451909200007",NA,3320,"Absence"

"50","The core microbiota of plants exerts key effects on plant performance and resilience to stress. The aim of this study was to identify the core endophytic mycobiome in U. minor stems and disentangle associations between its composition and the resistance to Dutch elm disease (DED). We also defined its spatial variation within the tree and among distant tree populations. Stem samples were taken i) from different heights of the crown of a 168-year-old elm tree, ii) from adult elm trees growing in a common garden and representing a gradient of resistance to DED, and iii) from trees growing in two distant natural populations, one of them with varying degrees of vitality. Endophyte composition was profiled by high throughput sequencing of the first internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1) of the ribosomal DNA. Three families of yeasts (Buckleyzymaceae, Trichomeriaceae and Bulleraceae) were associated to DED-resistant hosts. A small proportion (10%) of endophytic OTUs was almost ubiquitous throughout the crown while tree colonization by most fungal taxa followed stochastic patterns. A clear distinction in endophyte composition was found between geographical locations. By combining all surveys, we found evidence of a U. minor core mycobiome, pervasive within the tree and ubiquitous across locations, genotypes and health status.","Macaya-Sanz, D; Witzell, J; Collada, C; Gil, L; Martin, JA",NA,NA,NA,"Macaya-Sanz, David; Witzell, Johanna; Collada, Carmen; Gil, Luis; Martin, Juan A.",NA,"Core endophytic mycobiome in <i>Ulmus minor</i> and its relation to Dutch elm disease resistance","FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Macaya-Sanz, David/H-1041-2012; Martín, Juan/B-9729-2012; Gil, Luis/E-3216-2014; Collada, Carmen/H-1529-2015; Witzell, Johanna/H-9987-2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-462X",NA,NA,NA,NA,"FEB 28",2023,14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3389/fpls.2023.1125942","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1125942",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36925756,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000949046100001",NA,7525,"Absence"

"52","Fungal symbionts occur in all plant tissues, and many aid their host plants with critical functions, including nutrient acquisition, defense against pathogens, and tolerance of abiotic stress. ""Core"" taxa in the plant mycobiome, defined as fungi present across individuals, populations, or time, may be particularly crucial to plant survival during the challenging seedling stage. However, studies on core seed fungi are limited to individual sampling sites, raising the question of whether core taxa exist across large geographic scales. We addressed this question using both culture-based and culture-free techniques to identify the fungi found in individual seeds collected from nine provenances across the range of coastal Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii), a foundation tree species in the Pacific Northwest and a globally important timber crop that is propagated commercially by seed. Two key findings emerged: (i) Seed mycobiome composition differed among seed provenances. (ii) Despite variation in the seed mycobiome, we detected four core members, none of which is a known pathogen of Douglas-fir: Trichoderma spp., Hormonema macrosporum, Mucor plumbeus, and Talaromyces rugulosus. Our results support the concept of a core seed microbiome, yet additional work is needed to determine the functional consequences of core taxa for seedling germination, growth, survival, and competition.","Bergmann, GE; Busby, PE",NA,NA,NA,"Bergmann, Gillian E.; Busby, Posy E.",NA,"The core seed mycobiome of <i>Pseudotsuga menziesii</i> var. <i>menziesii</i> across provenances of the Pacific Northwest, USA","MYCOLOGIA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bergmann, Gillian/JGE-0536-2023","Bergmann, Gillian/0000-0002-7533-4318",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0027-5514","1557-2536",NA,NA,NA,"NOV 2",2021,113,"6",NA,NA,NA,"1169","1180",NA,"10.1080/00275514.2021.1952830","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00275514.2021.1952830",NA,"SEP 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,34543153,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000698233800001",NA,3875,"Absence"

"54","Three commercial coal tips in the Illawarra region of New South Wales [Australia] were investigated for the incidence of VA [vesicular-arbuscular] mycorrhizas in plants growing on them. All the plants examined [Prostanthera sieberi, Eucalyptus spp., Leucopogon lanceolatus, Hibbertia dentata, Casuarina spp., Lantana camara, legumes, composites, grasses] except species of Persoonia and Banksia (Proteaceae) were inypes of fungal endophytes, namely Glomus macrocarpus var. macrocarpus, G. mosseae and Sclerocystis rubiformis, were identified. The possible role of VA mycorrhizas in plant colonization of coal spoil areas is discussed. The method of colorimetric quantification of VA infection was found a useful alternative to the slow and tedious method of clearing and staining. But the pigment-extraction method is reliable only for measuring mycorrhizal infection in controlled short term experiments. This method, however, cannot be used to analyze infection in field-grown, long established roots.","KHAN, AG",NA,NA,NA,"KHAN, AG",NA,"VESICULAR-ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAS IN PLANTS COLONIZING BLACK WASTES FROM BITUMINOUS COAL MINING IN ILLAWARRA REGION OF NEW-SOUTH-WALES","NEW PHYTOLOGIST",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0028-646X","1469-8137",NA,NA,NA,NA,1978,81,"1",NA,NA,NA,"53","63",NA,"10.1111/j.1469-8137.1978.tb01603.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1978.tb01603.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1978FE93500006",NA,8813,"Absence"
"55","Mycotoxins are toxic secondary metabolites produced by fungi that are toxic to plants, animals, and humans. These toxins affect seed germination, seed quality, seed viability, the growth of the coleoptile and root, seedling vigor, etc. Common mycotoxins include aflatoxin, ochratoxin A, fumonisins, trichothecenes, and zearalenone. Aflatoxin suppresses the levels of nucleic acid, proteins, and germination in plants. Penicillic acid inhibits the lactic dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes. Citrinin affects the translocation process and disturbs the osmotic balance. The patulin effect involves the intoxication of cell cultures leading to the inhibition of DNA, protein, and RNA synthesis. Ochratoxin shows hypersensitive responses that increase reactive oxygen species and enhance the xenobiotic detoxification and defense response of antioxidant enzymes. These mycotoxins are often produced by fungal endophytes affecting plant growth enzymes. They colonize plant root tissues, resulting in the development of various plant-related diseases. The susceptibility of a plant species is regulated by physiological and genetic factors such as age, nutrition, hormones, environmental exposure, parasitism, and infections. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

"57","Salt-affected soils have detrimental effects on agriculture and ecosystems. However, these soils can still be used for halophyte (salt-tolerant plants) cultivation using brackish and/or saline water. In this study, we employed soil technologies and mutualistic microorganisms as a sustainable strategy to improve the growth and reproduction of the halophyte Limonium algarvense Erben's growth and reproduction under saline conditions. A microcosm assay was conducted under controlled greenhouse conditions to cultivate L. algarvense using a saline Fluvisol (FLU) amended-or not-with a Technosol (TEC). Plants were inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF) Rhizoglomus irregulare and/or a consortium of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB), and they were irrigated with estuarine water. Soil enzyme analysis and physicochemical characterisation of the soils, collected at the beginning and at the end of the assay, were carried out. The physiological status of non-inoculated and inoculated plants was monitored during the assay for 4 months, and AMF root colonisation was evaluated. In FLU, only plants inoculated with the AMF survived. These plants had lower number of leaves, and shoot and root dry biomass than the ones grown in the TEC by the end of the assay. In the TEC, PGPB inoculation led to higher NDVI and PRI values, and AMF inoculation promoted higher reproductive development but not pollen fertility. The findings show that the combined use of soil and microbial technologies can be successfully applied to cultivate L. algarvense, suggesting their generalized use for other Limonium species with economic interest, while contributing to the sustainable use of marginal lands.","Nogales, A; Navarro-Torre, S; Abreu, MM; Santos, ES; Cortinhas, A; Fors, R; Bailly, M; Róis, AS; Caperta, AD",NA,NA,NA,"Nogales, Amaia; Navarro-Torre, Salvadora; Abreu, Maria Manuela; Santos, Erika S.; Cortinhas, Ana; Fors, Rosalba; Bailly, Marion; Rois, Ana Sofia; Caperta, Ana Delaunay",NA,"Unravelling the Combined Use of Soil and Microbial Technologies to Optimize Cultivation of Halophyte <i>Limonium algarvense</i> (Plumbaginaceae) Using Saline Soils and Water","SOIL SYSTEMS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Abreu, Maria/AAK-9721-2021; Navarro-Torre, Salvadora/AAA-8432-2021; Fors, Rosalba/AAY-6804-2020; Santos, Erika/ABB-8168-2021; Cortinhas, Ana/AAZ-3877-2020; Nogales, Amaia/L-9765-2016; Cortinhas, Ana/H-4009-2014","Nogales, Amaia/0000-0001-8260-6580; Navarro-Torre, Salvadora/0000-0002-1037-2057; Ortega Fors, Rosalba/0000-0002-5145-493X; Santos, Erika/0000-0002-3664-839X; Abreu, Maria Manuela/0000-0002-6650-1161; Cortinhas, Ana/0000-0003-2392-9448",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2571-8789",NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2023,7,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/soilsystems7030074","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/soilsystems7030074",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001079666500001",NA,6662,"Absence"

"59","Inadvertent accumulation of arsenic (As) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a concern for people depending on it for their subsistence, as it verily causes epigenetic alterations across the genome as well as in specific cells. To ensure food safety, certain attempts have been made to nullify this highest health hazard encompassing physiological, chemical and biological methods. Albeit, the use of mycorrhizal association along with nutrient reinforcement strategy has not been explored yet. Mechanisms of response and resistance of two rice genotypes to As with or without phosphorus (P) nutrition and Serendipita indica (S. indica; S.i) colonization were explored by root transcriptome profiling in the present study. Results revealed that the resistant genotype had higher auxin content and root plasticity, which helped in keeping the As accumulation and P starvation response to a minimum under alone As stress. However, sufficient P supply and symbiotic relationship switched the energy resources towards plant's developmental aspects rather than excessive root proliferation. Higher As accumulating genotype (GD-6) displayed upregulation of ethylene signaling/biosynthesis, root stunting and senescence related genes under As toxicity. Antioxidant defense system and cytokinin biosynthesis/signaling of both genotypes were strengthened under As + S.i + P, while the upregulation of potassium (K) and zinc (Zn) transporters depicted underlying cross-talk with iron (Fe) and P. Differential expression of phosphate transporters, peroxidases and GSTs, metal detoxification/transport proteins, as well as phytohormonal metabolism were responsible for As detoxification. Taken together, S. indica symbiosis fortified with adequate P-fertilizer can prove to be effective in minimizing As acquisition and accumulation in rice plants.","Sehar, S; Adil, MF; Askri, SMH; Feng, QD; Wei, DM; Sahito, FS; Shamsi, IH",NA,NA,NA,"Sehar, Shafaque; Adil, Muhammad Faheem; Askri, Syed Muhammad Hassan; Feng, Qidong; Wei, Dongming; Sahito, Falak Sehar; Shamsi, Imran Haider",NA,"Pan-transcriptomic Profiling Demarcates <i>Serendipita Indica</i>-Phosphorus Mediated Tolerance Mechanisms in Rice Exposed to Arsenic Toxicity","RICE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wei, Dongming/AAB-4779-2020; Sehar, Shafaque/JZU-0844-2024; ASKRI, SYED MUHAMMAD HASSAN/ITU-6108-2023; Adil, Muhammad Faheem/AHE-2507-2022","Askri, Syed Muhammad Hassan/0000-0002-9104-8653; Sehar, Shafaque/0000-0003-4606-0175; Adil, Muhammad Faheem/0000-0001-5570-4433",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1939-8425","1939-8433",NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2023,16,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1186/s12284-023-00645-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12284-023-00645-0",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37354226,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001016887800001",NA,4602,"Absence"
"60","A lack of winter hardiness limits the utility of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) as a turf and forage grass in northern latitudes. The fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae var. lolii is commonly associated with perennial ryegrass and is believed to enhance stress tolerance in some environments. The effect of E. festucae var. lolii on freezing tolerance was assessed using seven diverse perennial ryegrass entries. Freezing tolerance was used as a proxy for winter hardiness, and most entries had been previously field tested to confirm this supposition. Three experiments were designed to isolate the effect of the endophyte from confounding effects from the grass host and the endophyte removal process. Experiment 1 compared hosts with (E+) or without (E-) endophytes that were either genetically identical or non-isogenic, but from the same entry. Isogenic E+ and E- plants did not differ in freezing tolerance; however, some non-isogenic populations differed in freezing tolerance. Experiment 2 used additional populations of non-isogenic hosts to confirm the association between freezing tolerant hosts and endophyte infection. Isogenic hosts were polycrossed and the half-sib E+ and E- progeny were used in Exp. 3, eliminating any effect of the endophyte removal process. Freezing tolerance did not vary between related families differing in endophyte infection, confirming that highly related hosts were not affected by endophyte. These results strongly suggest that native E. festucae var. lolii has no direct effect on freezing tolerance but may be found in higher frequencies in freezing-tolerant hosts.","Heineck, GC; Watkins, E; Ehlke, NJ",NA,NA,NA,"Heineck, Garett C.; Watkins, Eric; Ehlke, Nancy Jo",NA,"The Fungal Endophyte <i>Epichloe festucae</i> var. <i>lolii</i> Does Not Improve the Freezing Tolerance of Perennial Ryegrass","CROP SCIENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0011-183X","1435-0653",NA,NA,NA,"JUL-AUG",2018,58,"4",NA,NA,NA,"1788","1800",NA,"10.2135/cropsci2017.12.0731","http://dx.doi.org/10.2135/cropsci2017.12.0731",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000442536500031",NA,166,"Absence"
"61","DNA fingerprinting using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers was employed to investigate the genetic variation within and among populations of Miscanthus Anderss. sinensis var. condensatus (Hack.) Makino, an apomictic grass distributed along the coasts of Taiwan and Ryukyu Islands. A total of 250 plants from three Taiwanese populations (Southeast Coast, Orchid Islet, and Green Islet) and two populations from Ryukyu (Ishigaki and Amami-O-Shima Islets) were sampled. The amplified products of 40 random primers showed monomorphic banding patterns within all populations as well as among the three populations from Taiwan. Low genetic variation (with only two polymorphic loci), but significant differentiation, was detected between populations from Taiwan and Ryukyu (φCT = 0.864) and between populations (φST= 1.0) from lshigaki and Amami-O-Shima Islets. In contrast, a high level of variation was exhibited in the outcrossing Miscanthus sinensis var. glaber (Nakai) Li. In addition to apomictic reproduction, low genetic variation across populations of M. sinensis var. condensatus may be a result of high salinity acting as a selective agent. With the cost of reduced genetic heterogeneity, apomixis may have provided a mechanism for avoiding the transmission of endophytic fungi. The phytogeographic pattern of M. sinensis var. condensatus, as reflected by the RAPD data, likely represents isolation between Taiwan and Ryukyu since the mid-Pleistocene.","Chou C.-H.; Chiang Y.-C.; Chiang T.-Y.",NA,"",NA,"Chou, C.-H.

"62","Water scarcity is a major constraint that adversely affects plant development and growth. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a plant stress hormone that is rapidly synthesized and can induce stomatal closure to conserve water, thereby alleviating the drought stress of plants. The Epichloe endophyte enhances the drought tolerance of Achnatherum inebrians (drunken horse grass, DHG). To better understand how the Epichloe endophyte enhances drought tolerance, DHG plants without (EF) and with (EI), an Epichloe endophyte, were grown under 20% and 60% soil water conditions (SWC), and the leaves of the three treatments of EF and EI plants were sprayed with ABA solution (1 mg/L); fluridone (FLU), the ABA biosynthesis inhibitor solution (1 mg/L); and distilled water, respectively. Four-weeks later, the results indicated that the exogenous ABA application promoted plant growth, stomatal conductance, and photosynthetic rate, while the opposite effect occurred with plants sprayed with FLU. The differences between EI and EF plants in tiller number, height, chlorophyll content, stomata conductance, and photosynthetic rate were highest when sprayed with ABA. Thus, it is concluded that ABA might be involved in the moderating effect of Epichloe endophytes on DHG plants exposed to drought by maintaining growth and improving photosynthetic efficiency.","Cui, XL; He, W; Christensen, MJ; Yue, JF; Zeng, FN; Zhang, XX; Nan, ZB; Xia, C",NA,NA,NA,"Cui, Xuelian; He, Wen; Christensen, Michael John.; Yue, Jinfeng; Zeng, Fanbin; Zhang, Xingxu; Nan, Zhibiao; Xia, Chao",NA,"Abscisic Acid May Play a Critical Role in the Moderating Effect of <i>Epichloe</i> Endophyte on <i>Achnatherum inebrians</i> under Drought Stress","JOURNAL OF FUNGI",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Xia, Chao/CAJ-4635-2022; Zhang, Xingxu/AAX-7502-2021","Xia, Chao/0000-0001-5070-3634; , Xingxu/0000-0002-5131-7919",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2309-608X",NA,NA,NA,"NOV",2022,8,"11",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/jof8111140","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof8111140",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36354907,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000881271800001",NA,9345,"Absence"

Here we tested the hypothesis that the plant microbiome is partially inherited through vertical transmission. An experimental culturing device was constructed to grow oak seedlings in a microbe-free environment while keeping belowground and aboveground tissues separated. The microbial communities associated with the acorn's embryo and pericarp and the developing seeding's phyllosphere and root systems were analysed using amplicon sequencing of fungal ITS and bacterial 16S rDNA. Results showed that the seed microbiome is diverse and non-randomly distributed within an acorn. The microbial composition of the phyllosphere was diverse and strongly resembled the composition found in the embryo, whereas the roots and pericarp each had a less diverse and distinct microbial community. Our findings demonstrate a high level of microbial diversity and spatial partitioning of the fungal and bacterial community within both seed and seedling, indicating inheritance, niche differentiation and divergent transmission routes for the establishment of root and phyllosphere communities.","Abdelfattah, A; Wisniewski, M; Schena, L; Tack, AJM",NA,NA,NA,"Abdelfattah, Ahmed; Wisniewski, Michael; Schena, Leonardo; Tack, Ayco J.

"64","We report the discovery and spread of a dwarf ecotype of Spartina alterniflora in San Francisco Bay. Relative to typical S. alterniflora, this dwarf ecotype has one-fifth the tiller height (similar to 21 cm), tenfold the tiller density (similar to 4000 tillers/m(2)), and is restricted to growth in the upper intertidal zone. Chromosome counts of the dwarfs are identical to typical smooth cordgrass (2n = 62), and smooth cordgrass-specific random amplified DNA markers confirm the species identity of the dwarf. Field collected clonal fragments of the dwarf grown for 2 yr under high-nutrient conditions maintained the dwarf syndrome, as did plants grown from the seed of a dwarf. The dwarf condition is not caused by endophytic fungi. The first dwarf smooth cordgrass patch was discovered in 1991, and by 1996 five separate dwarf patches had appeared within 200 m of the original. Since 1991, total area covered by the dwarf ecotype has increased sixfold to 140 m(2). The ecological range of the dwarf smooth cordgrass ecotype is similar to that of S. patens, a competitor on the Atlantic coast. We suggest that the absence of S. patens from most of San Francisco Bay has allowed the dwarf ecotype of smooth cordgrass to survive and spread.","Daehler, CC; Anttila, CK; Ayres, DR; Strong, DR; Bailey, JP",NA,NA,NA,"Daehler, CC; Anttila, CK; Ayres, DR; Strong, DR; Bailey, JP",NA,"Evolution of a new ecotype of <i>Spartina alterniflora</i> (Poaceae) in San Francisco Bay, California, USA","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Daehler, Curtis/AFT-4821-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0002-9122",NA,NA,NA,NA,"APR",1999,86,"4",NA,NA,NA,"543","546",NA,"10.2307/2656815","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2656815",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,10205074,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000079792500011",NA,9445,"Absence"
"65","A manipulative field study was carried out to determine whether the foliar endophyte fungus, Phialocephala scopiformis DAOM 229536, decreased the performance of eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana larvae developing on white spruce trees. Overwintered second-instar budworm larvae from a laboratory colony or from a wild population were placed on endophyte positive or negative trees one or two weeks before budburst. The presence of the endophyte in the needles reduced the survival of C. fumiferana from both a wild population and a laboratory colony. Survival for budworm juveniles up to pupation and to adult emergence was 13% and 17% lower, respectively, on endophyte positive trees. The endophyte did not influence the size or sex of survivors and budworm survival was not influenced by any two- or three-way interactions. Budworm survival was higher for wild than for laboratory-reared budworm and for budworm placed on trees a week before budburst. This may be the first field study to demonstrate the efficacy of an endophytic fungus against wild individuals of a major forest insect pest. The efficacy of the endophyte at low larval densities suggests that it could be a useful tactic to limit spruce budworm population growth in the context of an early intervention strategy.","Dan, QR; Adams, G; Flaherty, L; McCartney, A; Miller, JD; Edwards, S",NA,NA,NA,"Dan Quiring; Adams, Greg; Flaherty, Leah; McCartney, Andrew; Miller, J.

"66","Biodiversity research rapidly progresses due to the continuous improvement of high-throughput analysis platforms, which facilitate detailed analyses of the composition and architecture of microbial communities in various environmental niches. In the fields of applied forestry and agriculture, microbial communities are also increasingly considered, because they are involved in various kinds of biotic interactions with plants and therefore have high diagnostic value for assessing the health status of plants and soils. While in-depth identification of microbial species in environmental samples is currently achieved by next generation sequencing or microarray techniques, profiling of whole microbial communities can be accomplished via less labor-intensive approaches. We modified the protocol for automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) by targeting length polymorphism of the fungal ITS1 rRNA gene for a rapid diagnostic assessment of fungal community composition and surveyed its application spectrum. The approach allowed for spatial and temporal differentiation among fungal assemblages in soil samples and different plant species, and is therefore particularly useful for environmental screening and monitoring projects.

"68","In natural and agricultural systems, the plant microbiome-the microbial organisms associated with plant tissues and rhizosphere soils-has been shown to have important effects on host physiology and ecology, yet we know little about how these plant microbe relationships play out in urban environments. Here we characterize the composition of fungal communities associated with living leaves of one of the most common sidewalk trees in the city of San Francisco, California. We focus our efforts on endophytic fungi (asymptomatic microfungi that live inside healthy leaves), which have been shown in other systems to have large ecological effects on the health of their plant hosts. Specifically, we characterized the foliar fungal microbiome of Metrosideros excelsa (Myrtaceae) trees growing in a variety of urban environmental conditions. We used high-throughput culturing, PCR, and Sanger sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS nrDNA) region to quantify the composition and structure of fungal communities growing within healthy leaves of 30 M. excelsa trees from six distinct sites, which were selected to capture the range of environmental conditions found within city limits. Sequencing resulted in 854 high-quality ITS sequences. These sequences clustered into 85 Operational Taxonomic Units (97% OTUs). We found that these communities encompass relatively high alpha (within) and beta (between-site) diversity. Because the communities are all from the same host tree species, and located in relatively close geographical proximity to one another, these analyses suggest that urban environmental factors such as heat islands or differences in vegetation or traffic density (and associated air quality) may potentially be influencing the composition of these fungal communities. These biogeographic patterns provide evidence that plant microbiomes in urban environments can be as dynamic and complex as their natural counterparts. As human populations continue to transition out of rural areas and into cities, understanding the factors that shape environmental microbial communities in urban ecosystems stands to become increasingly important.","Gibson, E; Zimmerman, NB",NA,NA,NA,"Gibson, Emma; Zimmerman, Naupaka B.",NA,"Urban biogeography of fungal endophytes across San Francisco","PEERJ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2167-8359",NA,NA,NA,NA,"JUL 31",2023,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.7717/peerj.15454","http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.15454",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,37547726,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001044665500004",NA,4333,"Absence"

Here, we studied the mycobiome of seed wings as they are transferred with seeds in common ash and tested whether the mycobiome differs among trees. To achieve this, we used ITS1-based amplicon sequencing and two genotypes of F. excelsior as a model to compare the mycobiome of mother trees and their wings. Results We compared the mycobiome of 57 seed wings to the seed stalks (57) collected from two genotypes of F. excelsior using three ramets of each genotype. Alpha diversity indices (ACE, Fisher and Observed OTUs) suggested a higher richness of the mycobiome associated with the seed wing than the seed stalk within each genotype. However, there were neither significant differences in Shannon diversity between the mycobiomes from the two tissue types nor the two genotypes. PERMANOVA revealed significant differences in the mycobiome composition between tissue types (P < 0.001). It also showed a significant difference between seed wings (P = 0.04), but not between seed stalks of the two genotypes.

"72","Context. Small mammalian herbivores, such as European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), can have significant unwanted impacts on agriculture and horticulture and can attract birds of prey and avian scavengers to airports, increasing the risk of bird strike. Sustainable wildlife management tools that have high efficacy and animal welfare are needed to mitigate these impacts. Aim. We assessed perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) cultivars associated with selected Epichlo endophytes, originally developed for bird management at airports, to determine their feeding-deterrent properties towards invasive rabbits. Methods. A pellet feed trial using caged domestic rabbits and a pen trial using wild rabbits were conducted to assess rabbit responses to food pellets with novel endophyte-infected or uninfected grass seed and to plots planted with endophyte-infected or uninfected grasses, respectively. Key results. Caged rabbits ate significantly less food pellets containing endophyte-infected grass straw than pellets containing endophyte-free grass straw. Wild rabbits consumed significantly less herbage from plots planted with endophyte-infected grasses than those of the equivalent endophyte-free grass cultivars. Temporal patterns of rabbit feeding behaviour support the hypothesis that deterrence in rabbits resulted from post-ingestion feedback associated with grass-endophyte secondary metabolites.

"73","The majority of vascular plants are mycorrhizal: 72% are arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM), 2.0% are ectomycorrhizal (EcM), 1.5% are ericoid mycorrhizal and 10% are orchid mycorrhizal. Just 8% are completely nonmycorrhizal (NM), whereas 7% have inconsistent NM-AM associations. Most NM and NM-AM plants are nutritional specialists (e.g. carnivores and parasites) or habitat specialists (e.g. hydrophytes and epiphytes). Mycorrhizal associations are consistent in most families, but there are exceptions with complex roots (e.g. both EcM and AM). We recognize three waves of mycorrhizal evolution, starting with AM in early land plants, continuing in the Cretaceous with multiple new NM or EcM linages, ericoid and orchid mycorrhizas. The third wave, which is recent and ongoing, has resulted in root complexity linked to rapid plant diversification in biodiversity hotspots.","Brundrett, MC; Tedersoo, L",NA,NA,NA,"Brundrett, Mark C.; Tedersoo, Leho",NA,"Evolutionary history of mycorrhizal symbioses and global host plant diversity","NEW PHYTOLOGIST",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tedersoo, Leho/ABE-7452-2020; Brundrett, Mark/G-2101-2010","Brundrett, Mark/0000-0002-2501-9037",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0028-646X","1469-8137",NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2018,220,"4",NA,"SI",NA,"1108","1115",NA,"10.1111/nph.14976","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nph.14976",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,29355963,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000449521400020",NA,8022,"Absence"
"74","Background DNA-based testing has been gaining acceptance as a tool for authentication of a wide range of food products; however, its applicability for testing of herbal supplements remains contentious. Methods We utilized Sanger and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) for taxonomic authentication of fifteen herbal supplements representing three different producers from five medicinal plants: Echinacea purpurea, Valeriana officinalis, Ginkgo biloba, Hypericum perforatum and Trigonella foenum-graecum. Experimental design included three modifications of DNA extraction, two lysate dilutions, Internal Amplification Control, and multiple negative controls to exclude background contamination. Ginkgo supplements were also analyzed using HPLC-MS for the presence of active medicinal components. Results All supplements yielded DNA from multiple species, rendering Sanger sequencing results for rbcL and ITS2 regions either uninterpretable or non-reproducible between the experimental replicates. Overall, DNA from the manufacturer-listed medicinal plants was successfully detected in seven out of eight dry herb form supplements; however, low or poor DNA recovery due to degradation was observed in most plant extracts (none detected by Sanger; three out of seven-by NGS). NGS also revealed a diverse community of fungi, known to be associated with live plant material and/or the fermentation process used in the production of plant extracts. HPLC-MS testing demonstrated that Ginkgo supplements with degraded DNA contained ten key medicinal components. Conclusion Quality control of herbal supplements should utilize a synergetic approach targeting both DNA and bioactive components, especially for standardized extracts with degraded DNA. The NGS workflow developed in this study enables reliable detection of plant and fungal DNA and can be utilized by manufacturers for quality assurance of raw plant materials, contamination control during the production process, and the final product. Interpretation of results should involve an interdisciplinary approach taking into account the processes involved in production of herbal supplements, as well as biocomplexity of plant-plant and plant- fungal biological interactions.","Ivanova, NV; Kuzmina, ML; Braukmann, TWA; Borisenko, AV; Zakharov, EV",NA,NA,NA,"Ivanova, Natalia V.; Kuzmina, Maria L.; Braukmann, Thomas W.

"78","Patterns and drivers of succession provide insight into the mechanisms that govern community assembly, but remain poorly understood for microbial communities. We assess whether successional trends of trees are mirrored by foliar endophyte communities of three tree species across a deterministic woody successional gradient. Additionally, we test the relative contribution of abiotic predictors, biotic factors, and spatial distance between sites in predicting composition and richness of endophyte communities. Unlike the tree community, endophyte communities showed no consistent evidence of deterministic succession. Host identity was the most important factor structuring endophyte community composition; within hosts, spatial distance from the indigenous forest and between samples was important, while environmental predictors had small and inconsistent effects. Much variation in endophyte composition remained unexplained. In contrast, endophyte richness was well-explained by predictor variables. Host identity was most important in predicting endophyte richness, while the effect of other predictors on richness differed between host species. We conclude that deterministic succession in trees did not result in deterministic succession in endophyte communities; instead community assembly was most strongly influenced by host identity; while within hosts, neutral processes may be more important for endophyte assembly than deterministic factors.","Harris, MA; Kemler, M; Slippers, B; Jamison-Daniels, SL; Witfeld, F; Botha, M; Begerow, D; Brachmann, A; Greve, M",NA,NA,NA,"Harris, Mathew Andrew; Kemler, Martin; Slippers, Bernard; Jamison-Daniels, Samantha-Leigh; Witfeld, Frederick; Botha, Monique; Begerow, Dominik; Brachmann, Andreas; Greve, Michelle",NA,"Deterministic processes have limited impacts on foliar fungal endophyte communities along a savanna-forest successional gradient","FUNGAL ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Kemler, Martin/GSD-6740-2022; Brachmann, Andreas/I-2241-2013; Slippers, Bernard/IUP-9822-2023; Jamison, Samantha-Leigh/T-7620-2019; Slippers, Bernard/A-9351-2008","Slippers, Bernard/0000-0003-1491-3858; Harris, Mathew/0000-0003-4310-1146",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1754-5048","1878-0083",NA,NA,NA,"AUG",2023,64,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.funeco.2023.101249","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.funeco.2023.101249",NA,"JUN 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001019564100001",NA,5833,"Absence"

However, knowledge about the effects of DSEs on plant growth in such soils is poor compared to the well-known mycorrhizal fungi. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of three DSE strains isolated from TE-contaminated soils on the growth and mineral nutrition of Betula pendula and Populus tremula x alba grown on two contrasting TE-polluted soils. The three DSEs evenly colonized the two plant species in both soils. Nevertheless, plant responses to DSE inoculation varied from neutral to beneficial depending on soil properties. Depending on fungal strain and plant species, different factors seemed to contribute to plant growth promotion. Phialophora mustea Pr27 and Leptodontidium Pr30 decreased lipid peroxidation in birch shoots. Chlorophyll, K, and P concentrations increased in the shoots of Leptodontidium Pr30-inoculated trees, whereas Cd concentration decreased in Cadophora Fe06-inoculated birch. The absence of a general DSE-mediated plant growth-promoting behavior could represent a limiting factor for a generic use of DSEs in the tree-based phytomanagement of TE-contaminated soils. Our results suggest that the selection of strains adapted to particular edaphic conditions should not be overlooked within the framework of phytomanagement.","Berthelot, C; Blaudez, D; Leyval, C",NA,NA,NA,"Berthelot, Charlotte; Blaudez, Damien; Leyval, Corinne",NA,"Differential growth promotion of poplar and birch inoculated with three dark septate endophytes in two trace element-contaminated soils","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYTOREMEDIATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Blaudez, Damien/AAF-6517-2020","Blaudez, Damien/0000-0003-3287-3482",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1522-6514","1549-7879",NA,NA,NA,NA,2017,19,"12",NA,NA,NA,"1118","1125",NA,"10.1080/15226514.2017.1328392","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2017.1328392",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,28521510,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000416675000007",NA,2010,"Absence"

Half the plants were harvested for total nonstructural carbohydrate (TNC) analysis, the remainder grew for an additional 4 wk before harvesting. Effects of endophyte infection on tiller numbers, leaf area and TNC were highly dependent on host genotype at the time of defoliation.

The observed diversity, mostly measured as species richness of cultivated strains, ranges from a few taxa to more than 100 species per tree species. Statistical species richness and molecular phylogeny analyses indicate however, that the observed species numbers are only a fraction of the effective endophyte richness of a host plant, and that the relevant unit of biological organisation may lie below the species level, at the level of populations and phylotypes. State-of-the-art high-throughput techniques such as dilution-to-extinction cultivation and massively parallel sequencing of target DNA loci could overcome the limits that have prevented exhaustive surveys so far.

While mycorrhizal infection normally enhances uptake of mineral elements, such a function in metalliferous soils would be disadvantageous. The role of infection in heavy metal tolerance was therefore investigated in 3 ericaceous species. Plants in Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium macrocarpon and Rhododendron ponticum were grown in the mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal conditions in sand containing a dilute nutrient solution supplemented with Cu or Zn at 0, 10, 25, 50 and 75 and 0, 25, 50, 100, 150 mg-1, respectively. Fungal endophytes isolated from these host plants were also grown in pure culture over a wide range of concentrations of both metals. Mycorrhizal plants showed some growth in all metal treatments; nonmycorrhizal plants failed to grow in all but the lowest metal levels. The endophytes all grew vigorously up to 75 mg Cu l-1 and 150 mg Zn l-1. In all but 1 case, the mycorrhizal plants had a significantly lower concentration of metal in their shoots. Concentrations of metal in roots were higher in mycorrhizal plants. The hyphal complexes of the endophyte are proposed to provide adsorptive surfaces within the cortical cells of the host roots, thus facilitating exclusion of metals from the shoot and avoidance of metal toxicity. The ecological significance of these observations is discussed.","BRADLEY, R; BURT, AJ; READ, DJ",NA,NA,NA,"BRADLEY, R; BURT, AJ; READ, DJ",NA,"THE BIOLOGY OF MYCORRHIZA IN THE ERICACEAE .8.

"84","Dark septate endophytes (DSE), often referred as a miscellaneous group of ascomycetous anamorphic fungi, are making their way in root-microbiome research. Reports, on occurrence of these endophytic fungi, are increasingly emerging from various mountain ecosystems showing their dominance with increasing altitude; also causing shift in colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Can these DSE be seen as root associated bioindicators for climate change, by anticipating and monitoring shifts in the community structure of root mycorrhizae and endophytes?","Pandey, A",NA,NA,NA,"Pandey, Anita",NA,"Are dark septate endophytes bioindicators of climate in mountain ecosystems?","RHIZOSPHERE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2452-2198",NA,NA,NA,"MAR",2019,9,NA,NA,NA,NA,"110","111",NA,"10.1016/j.rhisph.2019.01.001","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rhisph.2019.01.001",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000458553200017",NA,2007,"Absence"

Soil treatment of infected potted plants with bitertanol was partially successful. Storage at 21.degree. C, short-term heat treatments, and fungicide treatments of infected seed were effective in destroying endophyte viability in greenhouse and field tests. Endophyte viability in infected seed was lost after 7-11 mo. of storage at 21.degree. C, but not after 19 mo. of storage at temperatures < 6.degree. C. The heat treatment at 57.degree. C for 40 min or at 49.degree. C for 7 days controlled the endophyte, but 9-16% loss of seed viability occurred. Some seed treatment fungicides reduced germination and seedling vigor in the greenhouse. Certain formulated triazole fungicides were nontoxic or only slightly phytotoxic. These included a 40% dust formulation of triadimenol and a wettable powder formulation of bitertanol. Two flowable formulations of triadimenol were effective seed treatment fungicides that controlled the endophyte in a field test.","SIEGEL, MR; VARNEY, DR; JOHNSON, MC; NESMITH, WC; BUCKNER, RC; BUSH, LP; BURRUS, PB; HARDISON, JR",NA,NA,NA,"SIEGEL, MR; VARNEY, DR; JOHNSON, MC; NESMITH, WC; BUCKNER, RC; BUSH, LP; BURRUS, PB; HARDISON, JR",NA,"A FUNGAL ENDOPHYTE OF TALL FESCUE - EVALUATION OF CONTROL METHODS","PHYTOPATHOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0031-949X","1943-7684",NA,NA,NA,NA,1984,74,"8",NA,NA,NA,"937","941",NA,"10.1094/Phyto-74-937","http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/Phyto-74-937",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1984TF16300011",NA,9025,"Absence"
"86","Aureobasidium pullulons and Epicoccum nigrum are frequently reported as endophytes of various crops, including grapevine (Vitis vinifera). Because of their potential role as biological control agents against grapevine pathogens, we examined the occurrence of A. pullulans and E. nigrum in two grapevine varieties (Merlot and Prosecco) in Italian vineyards where spontaneous recovery from phytoplasma disease is recurrent. Species-specific primers for A. pullulans and two genetically distinct strains of E. nigrum were designed in variable regions of ITS1 and ITS2. Primer specificity was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using purified DNA from other fungal endophytes that are usually encountered during isolation attempts from grapevine tissues and from several other strains of A. pullulans and E. nigrum isolated from other sources. In order to determine the occurrence of the two endophytes in grapevine plants, DNA was extracted from shoots of 44 grapevines collected in six vineyards from different localities of northeast Italy. Both endophytes were detected and their identity was confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns obtained from reference strains. RFLP analyses confirmed the presence of two E. nigrum strains belonging to different RFLP groups in grapevine. The molecular methods described allowed a sensitive, specific, and reliable identification of the two endophytes in grapevine.","Martini, M; Musetti, R; Grisan, S; Polizzotto, R; Borselli, S; Pavan, F; Osler, R",NA,NA,NA,"Martini, M.; Musetti, R.; Grisan, S.; Polizzotto, R.; Borselli, S.; Pavan, F.; Osler, R.",NA,"DNA-Dependent Detection of the Grapevine Fungal Endophytes <i>Aureobasidium pullulans</i> and <i>Epicoccum nigrum</i>","PLANT DISEASE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Musetti, Rita/AAK-1282-2020; Grisan, Simone/A-4371-2015","MUSETTI, Rita/0000-0001-8459-0869; Grisan, Simone/0000-0002-3476-4194",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0191-2917","1943-7692",NA,NA,NA,"OCT",2009,93,"10",NA,NA,NA,"993","998",NA,"10.1094/PDIS-93-10-0993","http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-93-10-0993",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30754374,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000270266400003",NA,1034,"Absence"
"87","Plants with ericoid and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) roots characteristically produce acidic polyphenol-rich residues which accumulate in soil, and may influence the activities of the fungal symbionts directly through toxic effects, or indirectly through effects on nitrogen availability. The ability of fungi representative of these mycorrhizal types to degrade soluble polyphenolic materials and, hence, to reduce their nutritional effects was investigated using tannic acid (TA) as a model compound. The ericold endophyte Hymenoscyphus ericae (Read). Korf and Kernan was able to readily degrade the compound, and as a result, to reduce its ability to bind protein. In contrast, the ECM fungi examined had only limited abilities to degrade TA. The presence of TA induced H. ericae but not the ECM fungi, to produce extracellular polyphenol oxidase. Mycelial yields and the extent of TA degradation by H. ericae were both enhanced by exogenous ammonium.","Bending G.D.; Read D.J.",NA,"",NA,"Bending, Gary D. (7003975658); Read, David J.

Endophyte presence provides plant parasitic nematode resistance, but not with all endophyte strains and cultivar combinations. This study sought to compare effects of four nematode genera on continental and Mediterranean cultivars infected with common toxic or novel endophyte strains. A 6-mon greenhouse study was conducted with continental cultivars, Kentucky 31 (common toxic) and Texoma MaxQ II (novel endophyte) and the Mediterranean cultivar Flecha MaxQ (novel endophyte). Endophyte-free plants of each cultivar were controls. Each cultivar 3 endophyte combination was randomly assigned to a control, low or high inoculation rate of a mixed nematode culture containing stunt nematodes (Tylenchorhynchus spp.), ring nematodes (Criconemella spp.), spiral nematodes (Helicotylenchus spp.), and lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus spp.). Endophyte infection had no effect on nematode population densities. The cultivar 3 endophyte interaction was significant. Population densities of stunt nematode, spiral nematode, and ring nematodes were higher for Flecha MaxQ than other cultivar 3 endophyte combinations.

"90","Aims Symbiotic relationships between fungal endophytes and grass species are known to increase stress resistance in the grass host; however, there is little evidence to suggest that the positive effects occur early in the grass life cycle. In this study, we explored the effects of the endophyte Epichloe festucae on the growth and survival of Festuca eskia seedlings under drought and frequent cutting stress. Methods Festuca eskia seedlings were collected from the western part of the plant repartition area in a non-symbiotic population located in a mesic and heavily grazed site (W-NS) and from the eastern part in a symbiotic population from a xeric and lightly grazed site (E-S). The E-S population was experimentally freed from its endophyte (E-F). Two greenhouse experiments were conducted to compare growth and survival between the three seedling types under drought stress and frequent cutting. In the first experiment, 126 seedlings per seedling type (n = 378) were grown for 6 weeks under non-limiting conditions before the cessation of watering. After 3 weeks without irrigation, full irrigation was restored for 10 days to measure the survival rate. Leaf length, leaf elongation rate and survival rate were assessed per population. In the second experiment, 156 seedlings per seedling type (n = 468) were grown under non-limiting conditions. All seedlings were cut to 3 cm high, twice a week, during the first month of growth. Leaf elongation and tillering were monitored on 52 seedlings per seedling type. For each type, seedling survival rate was determined by the number of plants alive after 10 days of regrowth, without cutting. Important Findings The drought experiment revealed a phenotypic differentiation to drought in 30 F. eskia populations, suggesting adaptive differentiation: the eastern seedlings showed the highest survival rate. A trade-off between growth and survival was highlighted: the highest drought survival rate was associated with the lowest leaf elongation rate under non-limiting water conditions. Endophyte presence in the eastern population increased seedling drought survival. In contrast, cutting survival rate was similar between W-NS and E-S because the presence of the endophyte increased seedling survival to frequent cutting. However, this positive effect came with a cost: the endophyte reduced seedling tillering rate.","Gibert, A; Hazard, L",NA,NA,NA,"Gibert, Anais; Hazard, Laurent",NA,"Endophyte infection of <i>Festuca eskia</i> enhances seedling survival to drought and cutting at the expense of clonal expansion","JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"; Gibert, Anais/E-5005-2018","Hazard, Laurent/0000-0002-0538-8214; Gibert, Anais/0000-0003-2924-2380",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1752-9921","1752-993X",NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2011,4,"4",NA,NA,NA,"201","208",NA,"10.1093/jpe/rtr009","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jpe/rtr009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000298039000002",NA,558,"Absence"

Tiller numbers, shoot and root dry weights, and presence or absence of A. lolii were determined when seedlings were harvested 40 days after emergence. The endophyte was detected in 125 of 318 seedlings harvested. The rate of emergence of seedlings was unaffected by A. lolii presence. Tiller numbers, shoot, root, and tiller weights at harvest were influenced by seed weight (1, 2, 3, and 4 mg seed weight categories) but not by A. lolii presence. There was, however, an interaction between seed weight category and endophyte presence: endophyte-infected seedlings derived from the 3 mg seed weight category had fewer tillers and lower shoot weights than did the comparable endophyte-free seedlings. © 1987 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Keogh R.G.; Lawrence T.",NA,"",NA,"Keogh, R.G.

"92","P> Many grass species are associated with maternally transmitted fungal endophytes. Increasing evidence shows that endophytes enhance host plant success under varied conditions, yet studies have rarely considered alternative mechanisms whereby these mutualistic symbionts may affect regeneration from seed. We performed a microcosm experiment to evaluate whether infection with Neotyphodium occultans affects recruitment in the annual grass Lolium multiflorum either directly, by infecting the seeds, or indirectly, by altering the suitability of recruitment microsites through the litter shed by host plants. Endophyte effects on establishment were tested for different litter depths and watering regimes under natural herbivory by leaf-cutting ants. Seed infection increased seedling emergence through the litter as well as final recruitment, irrespective of microsite conditions. However, litter produced by infected plants delayed emergence and decreased density of both infected and non-infected grass populations. Individual plant biomass did not change with seed infection but was increased under deep litter from endophyte-infected plants. Although seed infection did not protect establishing plants from leaf-cutting ants, herbivory was reduced in the presence of deep litter shed by infected plants. We conclude that fungal endophytes may affect host plant recruitment across subsequent generations not only by infecting the seeds but also through the host's dead remains. While the former effect entailed an advantage to infected plants, litter-mediated effects did not discriminate by infection status, and generally promoted the establishment of fewer and larger plants. Thus hidden foliar symbionts may play an underappreciated role in maintaining host species dominance through the litter produced by prior patch occupants.","Omacini, M; Chaneton, EJ; Bush, L; Ghersa, CM",NA,NA,NA,"Omacini, Marina; Chaneton, Enrique J.; Bush, Lowell; Ghersa, Claudio M.",NA,"A fungal endosymbiont affects host plant recruitment through seed- and litter-mediated mechanisms","FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Omacini, Marina/0000-0003-1460-262X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0269-8463","1365-2435",NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2009,23,"6",NA,NA,NA,"1148","1156",NA,"10.1111/j.1365-2435.2009.01582.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2435.2009.01582.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000271632200015",NA,5754,"Absence"

In this research, we determined the effects of the E. bromicola endophyte on growth, physiological properties and seed germination of wild barley under salt stress through a set of experiments. Our results demonstrate that endophyte-infected (E+) plants produced more tillers, higher biomass and yield, higher chlorophyll content and superoxide dismutase activity than endophyte-free (E-) plants under high salt stress. Seed germination parameters of E+ biotype were significantly higher than those of E- plants when NaCl concentration reached 200 and 300 mM. Our results demonstrate that E. bromicola endophytes increased tolerance to salt stress in wild barley by increasing seed germination and growth, and altering plant physiology.","Wang, ZF; Li, CJ; White, J",NA,NA,NA,"Wang, Zhengfeng; Li, Chunjie; White, James",NA,"Effects of <i>Epichloe</i> endophyte infection on growth, physiological properties and seed germination of wild barley under saline conditions","JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY AND CROP SCIENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"White, James/C-2280-2009; Li, Chunjie/G-4988-2012","White, James/0000-0002-6780-7066; Li, Chunjie/0000-0002-3287-2140",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0931-2250","1439-037X",NA,NA,NA,"FEB",2020,206,"1",NA,NA,NA,"43","51",NA,"10.1111/jac.12366","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jac.12366",NA,"SEP 2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000485047800001",NA,9508,"Absence"

These interactions may be fundamental to predicting ecological responses to global change because indirect effects occurring through altered species interactions can outweigh or interact with the direct effects of environmental drivers. In a multiyear field experiment (2010-2015), we tested how experimental addition of a mutualistic leaf endophyte (Epichloë amarillans) associated with American beachgrass (Ammophila breviligulata) interacted with an altered precipitation regime (±30%) to affect the belowground microbial community. Epichloë addition increased host root biomass at the plot scale, but reduced the length of extraradical arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal hyphae in the soil. Under ambient precipitation alone, the addition of Epichloë increased root biomass per aboveground tiller and reduced the diversity of AM fungi in A. breviligulata roots. Furthermore, with Epichloë added, the diversity of root-associated bacteria declined with higher soil moisture, whereas in its absence, bacterial diversity increased with higher soil moisture. Thus, the aboveground fungal mutualist not only altered the abundance and composition of belowground microbial communities but also affected how belowground communities responded to climate, suggesting that aboveground microbes have potential for cascading influences on community dynamics and ecosystem processes that occur belowground. © FEMS 2017.

"98","Mutualisms can strongly affect the structure of communities, but their influence on ecosystem processes is not well resolved. Here we show that a plant-microbial mutualism affects the rate of leaf litter decomposition using the widespread interaction between tall fescue grass (Lolium arundinaceum) and the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum. In grasses, fungal endophytes live symbiotically in the aboveground tissues, where the fungi gain protection and nutrients from their host and often protect host plants from biotic and abiotic stress. In a field experiment, decomposition rate depended on a complex interaction between the litter source (collected from endophyte-infected or endophyte-free plots), the decomposition microenvironment (endophyte-infected or endophyte-free plots), and the presence of mesoinvertebrates (manipulated by the mesh size of litter bags). Over all treatments, decomposition was slower for endophyte-infected fescue litter than for endophyte-free litter. When mesoinvertebrates were excluded using fine mesh and litter was placed in a microenvironment with the endophyte, the difference between endophyte-infected and endophyte-free litter was strongest. In the presence of mesoinvertebrates, endophyte-infected litter decomposed faster in microenvironments with the endophyte than in microenvironments lacking the endophyte, suggesting that plots differ in the detritivore assemblage. Indeed, the presence of the endophyte in plots shifted the composition of Collembola, with more Hypogastruridae in the presence of the endophyte and more Isotomidae in endophyte-free plots. In a separate outdoor pot experiment, we did not find strong effects of the litter source or the soil microbial/microinvertebrate community on decomposition, which may reflect differences between pot and field conditions or other differences in methodology. Our work is among the first to demonstrate an effect of plant-endophyte mutualisms on ecosystem processes under field conditions.","Lemons, A; Clay, K; Rudgers, JA",NA,NA,NA,"Lemons, A; Clay, K; Rudgers, JA",NA,"Connecting plant-microbial interactions above and belowground: a fungal endophyte affects decomposition","OECOLOGIA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Clay, Keith/C-8730-2012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0029-8549","1432-1939",NA,NA,NA,"OCT",2005,145,"4",NA,NA,NA,"595","604",NA,"10.1007/s00442-005-0163-8","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-005-0163-8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,16001218,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000232559900010",NA,5325,"Absence"
"99","Evidence is presented that ergot alkaloids are ubiquitous in tall fescue pastures infected with the clavicipitaceous fungal endophyte Sphacelia typhina (or Acremonium coenophialum). Ergopeptide alkaloids, predominantly ergovaline, constituted 10 to 50 percent of the total ergot alkaloid concentration, which was as high as 14 milligrams per kilogram in sheaths and 1.5 milligrams per kilogram in blades. Ergot alkaloid concentrations were substantially increased by application of large amounts (10 millimoles per liter) of potassium nitrate or ammonium chloride to infected plants in the greenhouse. The results indicate that ergot alkaloids are probably responsible for the toxicity to cattle of this common pasture and lawn grass and that ergotism-like toxicoses may be caused by clavicipitaceous fungi other than Claviceps.","LYONS, PC; PLATTNER, RD; BACON, CW",NA,NA,NA,"LYONS, PC; PLATTNER, RD; BACON, CW",NA,"OCCURRENCE OF PEPTIDE AND CLAVINE ERGOT ALKALOIDS IN TALL FESCUE GRASS","SCIENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0036-8075","1095-9203",NA,NA,NA,"APR 25",1986,232,"4749",NA,NA,NA,"487","489",NA,"10.1126/science.3008328","http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.3008328",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,3008328,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1986A932700025",NA,3312,"Absence"
"100","Orchids are critically dependent on fungi for seedling establishment and growth, so the distribution and diversity of orchids might depend on the associated fungal communities. We characterised the communities associated with eight orchid species in three Mediterranean protected areas, using a combination of above-ground analyses of sporophores and below ground molecular analyses of orchid root samples. In three years of sporophore collection in 25 plots around flowering orchid plants, 268 macrofungal species belonging to 84 genera were observed. Statistical analyses indicated a correlation between macrofungal diversity and orchid community variation, regardless of the effect of environmental and spatial factors characterizing the investigated orchid sites. Fungal ITS-DNA PCR amplification, cloning, and sequencing revealed Rhizoctonia-like fungi belonging to Ceratobasidiaceae (26 %), Tulasnellaceae (22.5 %), and Sebacinaceae (3.5 %), as well as other basidiomycetes and ascomycetes, in the roots of 99 orchid plants. Mycorrhizal specificity was low but co-occurring orchid species showed preferences for different partners. The diverse macrofungal communities found in the sites may contribute to orchid community variation without colonizing the orchid roots. Molecular analyses revealed a segregation of associated fungi, which may contribute to Mediterranean orchid coexistence in nature.","Pecoraro, L; Caruso, T; Cai, L; Gupta, VK; Liu, ZJ",NA,NA,NA,"Pecoraro, Lorenzo; Caruso, Tancredi; Cai, Lei; Gupta, Vijai Kumar; Liu, Zhong-Jian",NA,"Fungal networks and orchid distribution: new insights from above- and below-ground analyses of fungal communities","IMA FUNGUS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Caruso, Tancredi/H-1103-2012; Gupta, Vijai Kumar/O-2445-2014; Cai, Lei/W-4996-2017; Pecoraro, Lorenzo/N-7370-2013","Pecoraro, Lorenzo/0000-0002-3234-4698; Caruso, Tancredi/0000-0002-3607-9609",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2210-6340","2210-6359",NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2018,9,"1",NA,NA,NA,"1","11",NA,"10.5598/imafungus.2018.09.01.01","http://dx.doi.org/10.5598/imafungus.2018.09.01.01",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30018868,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000438287000024",NA,5700,"Absence"
