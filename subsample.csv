"1","Through the production of alkaloids and mycotoxins, the endophytic fungus of perennial ryegrass, Neotyphodium lolii, confers resistance to the host grass against several insect pasture pests and causes health problems in livestock. The effects of plant component, plant reproductive development, and plant management (trimming) on the concentration and accumulation of peramine, the alkaloid thought to be most important for conferring resistance against Argentine stem weevil, were investigated. Clones of eight different naturally occurring perennial ryegrass-N. lolii associations were used in the experiment, which was conducted during spring-summer, which corresponded with the height of plant reproductive activity. Clones were either trimmed regularly to maintain them in a vegetative state (V clones) or not trimmed, allowing them to become fully reproductive (R clones). V and R clones of each grass/endophyte association were destructively harvested at times that corresponded roughly with the start, middle, and end of the plant reproductive phase. Harvested material was dissected into a number of plant components that were analyzed for peramine concentration by HPLC. All clippings from the V clones were also analyzed. Peramine concentrations were usually similar in leaf sheaths and leaf blades, but they decreased as leaf age increased. The seed from R clones and younger sheaths and blades of leaves from vegetative tillers contained the highest concentrations, while the root, crown, and dead leaf tissue contained the lowest. During the inflorescence phase, tissues from reproductive tillers generally contained lower concentrations than corresponding tissues from vegetative tillers. Also at this time, mean peramine concentrations were higher in V clones than in R clones. By the end of the plant reproductive phase, at the mature seed stage, mean peramine concentrations in R and V clones were similar. The seed component, which contained approximately 75% of the total peramine present in the plant (at a mean concentration of 63.7 mu g/g), probably accounted for much of the recovery in the R clones.","Ball, OJP; Barker, GM; Prestidge, RA; Lauren, DR",NA,NA,NA,"Ball, OJP; Barker, GM; Prestidge, RA; Lauren, DR",NA,"Distribution and accumulation of the alkaloid peramine in Neotyphodium lolii-infected perennial ryegrass","JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Barker, Gary/C-9974-2011",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0098-0331",NA,NA,NA,NA,"MAY",1997,"23","5",NA,NA,NA,"1419","1434",NA,"10.1023/B:JOEC.0000006473.26175.19","http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/B:JOEC.0000006473.26175.19",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1997XE71400018",NA,8939,"Absence"
"2","Three commercial coal tips in the Illawarra region of New South Wales [Australia] were investigated for the incidence of VA [vesicular-arbuscular] mycorrhizas in plants growing on them. All the plants examined [Prostanthera sieberi, Eucalyptus spp., Leucopogon lanceolatus, Hibbertia dentata, Casuarina spp., Lantana camara, legumes, composites, grasses] except species of Persoonia and Banksia (Proteaceae) were inypes of fungal endophytes, namely Glomus macrocarpus var. macrocarpus, G. mosseae and Sclerocystis rubiformis, were identified. The possible role of VA mycorrhizas in plant colonization of coal spoil areas is discussed. The method of colorimetric quantification of VA infection was found a useful alternative to the slow and tedious method of clearing and staining. But the pigment-extraction method is reliable only for measuring mycorrhizal infection in controlled short term experiments. This method, however, cannot be used to analyze infection in field-grown, long established roots.","KHAN, AG",NA,NA,NA,"KHAN, AG",NA,"VESICULAR-ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAS IN PLANTS COLONIZING BLACK WASTES FROM BITUMINOUS COAL MINING IN ILLAWARRA REGION OF NEW-SOUTH-WALES","NEW PHYTOLOGIST",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0028-646X","1469-8137",NA,NA,NA,NA,1978,"81","1",NA,NA,NA,"53","63",NA,"10.1111/j.1469-8137.1978.tb01603.x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8137.1978.tb01603.x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1978FE93500006",NA,8842,"Absence"
"3","Chinch bugs are common pests of many agronomic and horticulturally important crops and turfgrasses. Previous research has indicated that some grasses exhibit resistance to multiple chinch bug species, whereas others are resistant to only one species. The objectives of this research were to document differences in the probing frequencies and locations among Blissus species as well as differences in mouthpart morphology as a first step in understanding the differential responses of grasses to chinch bug feeding. Scanning electron microscopy detected differences in the total lengths of proboscises as well as individual mouthpart segments among the four species studied. Blissus occiduus Barber probed significantly more often on buffalograss, Buchloe dactyloides (Nuttall) Engelmann, than any other plant material. Probing locations of B. occiduus and Blissus leucopterus leucopterus (Say) were similar on both B. occiduus-resistant and susceptible buffalograsses and KS94 sorghum, Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench (B. occiduus-resistant, B. l. leucopterus-resistant). However, on 'Wheatland' sorghum (B. occiduus-resistant, B. l. leucopterus-susceptible), stylet tracts of B. l. leucopterus most often terminated in the bundle sheath cells, whereas those of B. occiduus generally terminated in the vascular tissues.","Anderson, WG; Heng-Moss, TM; Baxendale, FP; Baird, LM; Sarath, G; Higley, L",NA,NA,NA,"Anderson, WG; Heng-Moss, TM; Baxendale, FP; Baird, LM; Sarath, G; Higley, L",NA,"Chinch bug (Hemiptera: Blissidae) mouthpart morphology, probing frequencies, and locations on resistant and susceptible germplasm","JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Higley, Leon/I-6955-2012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0022-0493","1938-291X",NA,NA,NA,"FEB",2006,"99","1",NA,NA,NA,"212","221",NA,"10.1603/0022-0493(2006)099[0212:CBHBMM]2.0.CO;2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0022-0493(2006)099[0212:CBHBMM]2.0.CO;2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,16573342,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000235342200027",NA,1732,"Absence"
"4","The use of chemicals to fertilize crops incurs economic and environmental costs and it is widely recognized that the current level of chemical fertilizer use is unsustainable in many intensive farming systems. Any methods that can reduce fertilizer input and still maintain acceptable yields would be of great benefit to both the farmer and the environment. The use of beneficial endophytes as crop inoculants may go some way towards improving crop yields beyond that achievable using fertilizer increases alone. Field trials were conducted over two seasons on three contrasting field sites to test the effects of fungal endophytes from a wild barley relative on three barley cultivars (Mickle, Planet and Propino). Seeds were either untreated or dressed with a consortium of four endophyte strains, and three levels of nitrogen (N) were applied to both treatments: full N, 50% N and 0 N. On the field site with the lowest overall N input, the endophyte treatment with 50% N restored yield for Planet' to that associated with untreated plants receiving the full N input. On the same site and with the same cultivar, endophyte treatment increased yield by 15% under full N, and by a mean 12% for all three cultivars with 50% N input. Over both seasons and all three sites, the endophyte treatment increased yield for the cultivar Planet by a mean of 9%. For the endophyte-associated increase in the variety Planet grain yield over the untreated trials strong correlations were found between increased yield and each of low rainfall, greater evaporation and greater number of degree days above the base. Furthermore, the efficacy of the endophytes was not removed by regular foliar fungicidal treatment. These results suggest that fungal endophytes can contribute to improving barley yield grown in low rainfall areas and under a range of fertilizer input regimes, provided that endophyte treatments are applied to compatible crop cultivars and sites.","Murphy, BR; Hodkinson, TR; Doohan, FM",NA,NA,NA,"Murphy, B.

"5","Mycotoxins in agriculturally used plants can cause intoxication in animals and can lead to severe financial losses for farmers. The endophytic fungus Epichloe festucae var. lolii living symbiotically within the cool season grass species Lolium perenne can produce vertebrate and invertebrate toxic alkaloids. Hence, an exact quantitation of alkaloid concentrations is essential to determine intoxication risk for animals. Many studies use different methods to detect alkaloid concentrations, which complicates the comparability. In this study, we showed that alkaloid concentrations of individual plants exceeded toxicity thresholds on real world grasslands in Germany, but not on the population level. Alkaloid concentrations on five German grasslands with high alkaloid levels peaked in summer but were also below toxicity thresholds on population level. Furthermore, we showed that alkaloid concentrations follow the same seasonal trend, regardless of whether plant fresh or dry weight was used, in the field and in a common garden study. However, alkaloid concentrations were around three times higher when detected with dry weight. Finally, we showed that alkaloid concentrations can additionally be biased to different alkaloid detection methods. We highlight that toxicity risks should be analyzed using plant dry weight, but concentration trends of fresh weight are reliable.","Vikuk, V; Fuchs, B; Krischke, M; Mueller, MJ; Rueb, S; Krauss, J",NA,NA,NA,"Vikuk, Veronika; Fuchs, Benjamin; Krischke, Markus; Mueller, Martin J.; Rueb, Selina; Krauss, Jochen",NA,"Alkaloid Concentrations of <i>Lolium perenne</i> Infected with <i>Epichloe festucae</i> var. <i>lolii</i> with Different Detection Methods-A Re-Evaluation of Intoxication Risk in Germany?","JOURNAL OF FUNGI",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"mueller, martin/C-7616-2019; Fuchs, Benjamin/X-2095-2019; Krauss, Jochen/C-6216-2014","Fuchs, Benjamin/0000-0002-3678-3284; Vikuk, Veronika/0000-0002-2197-7756; Krauss, Jochen/0000-0003-2304-9117",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2309-608X",NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2020,"6","3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/jof6030177","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof6030177",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32961967,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000581198900001",NA,5373,"Absence"
"6","We report the occurrence of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens in vanilla orchids (Vanilla phaeantha) and cultivated hybrid vanilla (V. planifolia x V. pompona) as a systemic bacterial endophyte. We determined with light microscopy and isolations that tissues of V. phaeantha and the cultivated hybrid were infected by a bacterial endophyte and that shoot meristems and stomatal areas of stems and leaves were densely colonized. We identified the endophyte as B. amyloliquefaciens using DNA sequence data. Since additional endophyte-free plants and seed of this orchid were not available, additional studies were performed on surrogate hosts Amaranthus caudatus, Ipomoea tricolor, and I. purpurea. Plants of A. caudatus inoculated with B. amyloliquefaciens demonstrated intracellular colonization of guard cells and other epidermal cells, confirming the pattern observed in the orchids. Isolations and histological studies suggest that the bacterium may penetrate deeply into developing plant tissues in shoot meristems, forming endospores in maturing tissues. B. amyloliquefaciens produced fungal inhibitors in culture. In controlled experiments using morning glory seedlings we showed that the bacterium promoted seedling growth and reduced seedling necrosis due to pathogens. We detected the gene for phosphopantetheinyl transferase (sfp), an enzyme in the pathway for production of antifungal lipopeptides, and purified the lipopeptide surfactin from cultures of the bacterium. We hypothesize that B. amyloliquefaciens is a robust endophyte and defensive mutualist of vanilla orchids. Whether the symbiosis between this bacterium and its hosts can be managed to protect vanilla crops from diseases is a question that should be evaluated in future research. Microsc. Res.

"7","Microbial symbionts can affect plant nutrition, defensive chemistry, and biodiversity. Here we test the hypothesis that symbionts alter the speed and direction of plant succession in communities that are shifting from grasslands to forests. A widespread C-3 grass introduced to the United States, Lolium arundinaceum ( tall fescue), hosts a fungal endophyte that is toxic to herbivores. In replicated experimental grasslands, the presence of the endophyte in tall fescue reduced tree abundance and size, altered tree composition, and slowed plant species turnover. In addition, consumption of tree seedlings by voles ( Microtus spp.) was 65% higher in plots with the endophyte at the one grassland site where these data were collected. Despite its negligible contribution to community biomass, a microbial symbiont suppressed tree establishment, posing an important constraint on the natural transition from grasslands to forests.","Rudgers, JA; Holah, J; Orr, SP; Clay, K",NA,NA,NA,"Rudgers, Jennifer A.; Holah, Jenny; Orr, Samuel P.; Clay, Keith",NA,"Forest succession suppressed by an introduced plant-fungal symbiosis","ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Clay, Keith/C-8730-2012",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0012-9658","1939-9170",NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2007,"88","1",NA,NA,NA,"18","25",NA,"10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[18:FSSBAI]2.0.CO;2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[18:FSSBAI]2.0.CO;2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,17489448,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000245668300003",NA,5223,"Absence"
"8","Symbiotic associations play a role in plant ecology and evolution, but the outcome of the interaction depends on the life-history traits of the partners and the environmental context. Although symbiosis with vertically transmitted microorganisms should result in mutualism, it is not clear how the transmission process aligns with the outcome of the context-dependent symbiosis. For 3 years, we sampled individuals of an annual plant species that forms symbiosis with a vertically transmitted fungal endophyte, in paired stands of two contrasting vegetation communities (humid mesophytic meadows [HMM]: productive/low stress, and humid prairies [HP]: less productive/high stress). We estimated the prevalence of symbiosis at the population level, and the fitness of the plant, the symbiotic status and vertical transmission efficiency at the individual level.<br /> Over 3 years, the prevalence of symbiosis was approximate to 100% in HMM and approximate to 75% in HP. Plant fitness was very low and high in years with precipitation below and above the yearly mean, respectively. The higher fitness of endophyte-symbiotic plants was evident in the HMM and high precipitation years. Vertical transmission of endophytes was higher in HMM (approximate to 96%) compared to HP (approximate to 93%) and was not related to plant fitness. Despite transmission inefficiencies in HP, changes in prevalence within the growing season (from seeds to the final plant stand) suggest a fitness advantage for symbiotic plants.<br /> Vertical transmission is expected to promote mutualism as it aligns partners' fitness. Although symbiotic plants showed higher fitness and the probability of transmission failures was higher among low-fitness plants, the variation in transmission efficiency between plants and vegetation communities was not related to the fitness of the individual host. Our study provides evidence that context-dependent vertical transmission efficiency and endophyte-mediated fitness advantages interact complexly to determine the prevalence of symbiosis in populations that occur in contrasting vegetation communities.","Gundel, PE; Ueno, AC; Casas, C; Miller, TEX; Pérez, LI; Cuyeu, R; Omacini, M",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro E.; Ueno, Andrea C.; Casas, Cecilia; Miller, Tom E.

"9","The habitat-adapted symbiosis hypothesis predicts that the most positive effects of symbiosis are expected in the most stressful sites for a plant host. Stress varies with site characteristics but also during the life cycle of a plant, with winter annuals experiencing the most stress after fall emergence. For Bromus tectorum, fecundity can vary tremendously from a few to thousands of seeds per plant. We used endophytic Sordaria fimicola to test the hypothesis in three sites in western Montana. We hypothesized that the effects of S. fimicola inoculation would be most positive in the most stressful site after fall application. As predicted, the most positive effects on growth and fecundity were observed in the most stressful site after fall application of S. fimicola. However, the effects of treatments varied within and between sites considerably, and are best understood as an example of context-dependency in plant microbe interactions rather than habitat-adapted symbiosis.

"11","Pooideae grasses may be colonized by systemic fungal endophytes. The fitness of endophyte depends entirely on resources and seed transmission from the host plant, while colonized plants may gain increased survival, growth, and reproduction relative to their uncolonized conspecifics. Most research of endophyte-grass interactions have been carried out on few cultivars of tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix) and their symbiont Neotyphodium coenophialum. Lack of studies using wild populations of tall fescue across the species natural distribution range, however, limits the understanding of the ecological and evolutionary role of the symbiosis in nature. We performed a common garden experiment in Southern Finland with three wild, tall fescue populations from northern Europe and the forage cultivar Kentucky-31 (KY-31). For each population, we used naturally endophyte-colonized, naturally endophyte-colonized but endophyte removed (decolonized), and naturally uncolonized plants to separate effects due to the host genotype from the endophyte. We evaluated growth variables and survival in four environmental treatments of varying water and nutrients. Supply of water and nutrients increased plant biomass and reproductive effort in all populations. This effect was higher for KY-31 plants which produced on average 55 % more seeds than wild plants, indicating better adaptation to high resource environments. However, the higher incidence of Claviceps sp. and the low winter survival indicated KY-31 tall fescue is mal-adapted to Northern European conditions. Naturally colonized plants had greater plant biomass (a parts per thousand 12 %), reproductive effort (a parts per thousand 22 %) and seed mass (a parts per thousand 29 %) than naturally uncolonized and decolonized plants. Nonetheless, endophyte colonization did not affect plant survival, and the effects of endophyte colonization on tiller number, panicle/tiller ratio and Claviceps sp. incidence depended on the population origin. In the wild populations, endophyte removal only reduced the number of tillers (a parts per thousand 29 % lower), while the difference between naturally colonized and naturally uncolonized plants was not significant. Our results show that endophyte symbiont increases tall fescue performance in general, but the differences between wild populations and cultivars indicate adaptation to local habitats and agronomic management, respectively. The comparison of naturally endophyte-colonized and decolonized plants suggests certain plant genotype-endophyte combinations found within populations result from local selection pressures.","Gundel, PE; Helander, M; Casas, C; Hamilton, CE; Faeth, SH; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro E.; Helander, Marjo; Casas, Cecilia; Hamilton, Cyd E.; Faeth, Stanley H.; Saikkonen, Kari",NA,"<i>Neotyphodium</i> fungal endophyte in tall fescue (<i>Schedonorus phoenix</i>): a comparison of three Northern European wild populations and the cultivar Kentuky-31","FUNGAL DIVERSITY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013","Casas, Cecilia/0000-0003-3538-6081; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Hamilton, Cyd/0000-0002-6378-3407; Saikkonen, Kari/0000-0001-5203-9984; Helander, Marjo/0000-0002-9759-4321",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1560-2745","1878-9129",NA,NA,NA,"MAY",2013,"60","1",NA,"SI",NA,"15","24",NA,"10.1007/s13225-012-0173-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13225-012-0173-x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000320112900003",NA,6376,"Absence"

"13","Many plant endophytes produce mycotoxins, but how host genetic variation influences endophyte colonization and mycotoxin production under natural conditions is poorly understood. This interaction has not been fully considered in many previous studies which used controlled experiments with agronomic or model plant species. Here, we investigated this interaction in a naturally occurring forb (a locoweed species) Oxytropis ochrocephala, its symbiotic endophyte Alternaria oxytropis, and the mycotoxin swainsonine. Host genetic variation was characterized by microsatellite markers. Endophyte infection rate and swainsonine levels were determined by PCR and HPLC, respectively. Genetic markers defined two distinct host populations and revealed that host genetics were significantly correlated with geographical location, elevation, and precipitation. As the host diverged, symbiotic interactions were reduced or failed to produce detectable swainsonine in one host population. Host genotype and precipitation had a significant impact in shaping swainsonine production at the population level. This study highlights the effect of host genotype in influencing this interaction in locoweeds.","He, W; Guo, LW; Wang, L; Zhao, QQ; Guo, LZ; Cao, W; Mur, LAJ; Wei, YH",NA,NA,NA,"He, Wei; Guo, Linwei; Wang, Lei; Zhao, Qianqian; Guo, Lizhu; Cao, Wei; Mur, Luis A.

"16","This chapter summarises research carried out on the biology, ecology and the impact of the holomorph Apiognonwnia quercina/Discula quercina in oak forests. The major life-history traits and aspects of the epidemiology (isolation, survival, reproduction, dispersal, host selectivity) and control of the oak anthracnose agent are elucidated. The role of weather patterns in disrupting the delicate interaction between the host tree and the microorganism is outlined. The evidence suggests that changes in the climate profoundly alter the plant-endophyte symbiosis, generating conflicts of interest between the partners in the interaction. When such competing interests arise, the survival and reproduction of one member of the interaction do not conform with that of the partner. The interaction becomes thus disadvantageous and harmful to one of the organisms and the symbiosis from mutualistic or neutral turns antagonistic. The fungal partner, which under normal conditions survives in quiescence, with a low biomass, resumes growth but now switches from a latent, asymptomatic occupier of inner oak tissues to an aggressive coloniser that sporulates profusely over the tree surface. The importance of investigating the functioning and the role of the plant-endophyte symbiosis in perennial host trees in natural forests is stressed.","Moricca, S; Ragazzi, A",NA,"Pirttila, AM; Frank, AC",NA,"Moricca, Salvatore; Ragazzi, Alessandro",NA,"The Holomorph <i>Apiognomonia quercina</i>/<i>Discula quercina</i> as a Pathogen/Endophyte in Oak","ENDOPHYTES OF FOREST TREE: BIOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS","Forestry Sciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0924-5480","1875-1334","978-94-007-1598-1",NA,NA,NA,2011,"80",NA,NA,NA,NA,"47","66",NA,"10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8_3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8_3","10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000294391600003",NA,8663,"Absence"
"17","Recent work on microbiomes is revealing the wealth and importance of plant-microbe interactions. Microbial symbionts are proposed to have profound effects on fitness of their host plants and vice versa, especially when their fitness is tightly linked. Here we studied local adaptation of host plants and possible fitness contribution of such symbiosis in the context of abiotic environmental factors. We conducted a four-way multi-year reciprocal transplant experiment with natural populations of the perennial grass Festuca rubra s.l. from northern and southern Finland, Faroe Islands and Spain. We included F. rubra with and without transmitted symbiotic fungus Epichloe that is vertically transmitted via host seed. We found local adaptation across the European range, as evidenced by higher host fitness of the local geographic origin compared with nonlocals at three of the four studied sites, suggesting that selection pressures are driving evolution in different directions. Abiotic factors did not result in strong fitness effects related to Epichloe symbiosis, indicating that other factors such as herbivory are more likely to contribute to fitness differences between plants naturally occurring with or without Epichloe. Nevertheless, in the case of asymmetric symbiosis that is obligatory for the symbiont, abiotic conditions that affect performance of the host, may also cause selective pressure for the symbiont.","Leinonen, PH; Helander, M; Vazquez-de-Aldana, BR; Zabalgogeazcoa, I; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Leinonen, Paivi; Helander, Marjo; Vazquez-de-Aldana, Beatriz; Zabalgogeazcoa, Inigo; Saikkonen, Kari",NA,"Local adaptation in natural European host grass populations with asymmetric symbiosis","PLOS ONE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zabalgogeazcoa, Inigo/F-9523-2016; Leinonen, Paivi/IWV-0880-2023; Vazquez-de-Aldana, Beatriz/A-7760-2008","Zabalgogeazcoa, Inigo/0000-0002-9524-7799; Leinonen, Paivi/0000-0003-0210-5589; Vazquez-de-Aldana, Beatriz/0000-0001-6549-3545; Saikkonen, Kari/0000-0001-5203-9984",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1932-6203",NA,NA,NA,NA,"APR 17",2019,"14","4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0215510","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215510",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30995278,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000465010000058",NA,6523,"Absence"
"18","Understanding how species-rich communities persist is a foundational question in ecology. In tropical forests, tree diversity is structured by edaphic factors, climate, and biotic interactions, with seasonality playing an essential role at landscape scales: wetter and less seasonal forests typically harbor higher tree diversity than more seasonal forests. We posited that the abiotic factors shaping tree diversity extend to hyperdiverse symbionts in leaves-fungal endophytes-that influence plant health, function, and resilience to stress. Through surveys in forests across Panama that considered climate, seasonality, and covarying biotic factors, we demonstrate that endophyte richness varies negatively with temperature seasonality. Endophyte community structure and taxonomic composition reflect both temperature seasonality and climate (mean annual temperature and precipitation). Overall our findings highlight the vital role of climate-related factors in shaping the hyperdiversity of these important and little-known symbionts of the trees that, in turn, form the foundations of tropical forest biodiversity.","Oita, S; Ibáñez, A; Lutzoni, F; Miadlikowska, J; Geml, J; Lewis, LA; Hom, EFY; Carbone, I; U'Ren, JM; Arnold, AE",NA,NA,NA,"Oita, Shuzo; Ibanez, Alicia; Lutzoni, Francois; Miadlikowska, Jolanta; Geml, Jozsef; Lewis, Louise A.; Hom, Erik F.

"19","Tea (Camellia sinensis) and coffee (Coffea arabica) are the most consumed infusion beverages in the world. Each agroecosystem for their productions comes with a rich complex of insect and mite associates, most of which are not regarded as pests. However, a significant number of serious pests attack the leaves, roots, stems, and roots of each crop. The foliage of tea, the marketable part of the plant, is attacked by tortricid moths, hemipterans, and coleopterans. Although Bacillus thuringiensis is the most used microbial control agent of lepidopteran pests of tea, considerable research has been conducted on entomopathogenic viruses, mostly Baculoviruses, for their control and entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) as microbial control agents of hemipteran pests. Coffee plants are attacked by a broad range of insect and mite pests including coleopterans, lepidopterans, hemipterans, and mites. Among these, the coffee berry borer (CBB) is the most economically important pest of coffee worldwide. The EPF, Beauveria bassiana, has been used along with other interventions for its control in Colombia. Exploitation of the endophytic fungi associated with coffee as possible control agents of CBB is discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Nakai M.; Lacey L.A.",NA,"",NA,"Nakai, M.

"20","Microbial plant symbionts are widely spread in nature changing the way their hosts interact with their environment. Neotyphodium fungal endophytes (Clavicipitaceae) are grass symbionts known by their production of alkaloids, toxic for herbivores. Here, we hypothesized that endophytes confer associational protection to non-host plants and change emission of host volatile-compounds. In an outdoor mesocosm experiment, we examined aphid infestation on Trifolium repens plants, in response to Neotyphodium occultans presence in neighbouring Lolium multiflorum. Contrasting levels of Rhizobium were generated in T. repens plants considering that symbiosis with N-2-fixers would influence herbivore abundance. Aphid infestation increased responding to symbiotic status of T. repens plants, when surrounded by non-symbiotic L. multiflorum plants. Endophytes modified the volatile imprints of L. multiflorum plants measured by an electronic nose, suggesting a potential mechanism to benefit neighbours. This associational protection constitutes a new mutualism trait of grass-endophyte symbiosis, becoming a non-private benefit available to other community partners.

"21","The fungal diversity in harvested apples from organic or conventional management practices was analyzed in different fruit locations (stem end, calyx end, peel, and wounded flesh) shortly after fruit purchase (T1) and after 2 weeks of storage (T5). A total of 5,760,162 high-quality fungal sequences were recovered and assigned to 8,504 Operational Taxonomic Units. Members of the phylum Ascomycota were dominant in all samples and accounted for 91.6% of the total number of detected sequences. This was followed by Basidiomycota (8%), Chytridiomycota (0.1%), and unidentified fungi (0.3%). Alpha and beta diversity analyses revealed the presence of significantly different fungal populations in the investigated fruit parts. Among detected fungi, the genus Penicillium prevailed in the peel and in the wounded flesh while Alternaria spp. prevailed in the calyx and stem end samples that included apple core tissues. Several taxonomic units that appear to be closely related to pathogenic fungi associated with secondary human infections were present in peel and wounds. Moreover, significantly different populations were revealed in organic and conventional apples and this result was consistent in all investigated fruit parts (calyx end, peel, stem end, and wounded flesh). Several unique taxa were exclusively detected in organic apples suggesting that management practices may have been a contributing factor in determining the taxa present. In contrast, little differences were revealed in the two assessment times (T1 and T5). Results of the present study represent an advancement of the current knowledge on the fungal microbiota in collected fruit tissues of apple.","Abdelfattah, A; Wisniewski, M; Droby, S; Schena, L",NA,NA,NA,"Abdelfattah, Ahmed; Wisniewski, Michael; Droby, Samir; Schena, Leonardo",NA,"Spatial and compositional variation in the fungal communities of organic and conventionally grown apple fruit at the consumer point-of-purchase","HORTICULTURE RESEARCH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Abdelfattah, Ahmed/P-1943-2015; Schena, Leonardo/A-7492-2018","Abdelfattah, Ahmed/0000-0001-6090-7200; Schena, Leonardo/0000-0002-9737-2593; Wisniewski, Michael/0000-0002-7481-5590",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2052-7276",NA,NA,NA,NA,"OCT 5",2016,"3",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1038/hortres.2016.47","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/hortres.2016.47",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27766161,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000385438800001",NA,7849,"Absence"
"22","Phyllosticta is a cosmopolitan group of fungi found on various host plants, occurring as pathogens, endophytes and saprobes. Diseases caused by Phyllosticta commonly include leaf and fruit spots that can affect economically important plants. The genus is characterized mainly by aseptate and hyaline conidia and ascospores. Its conidia are surrounded by a mucilaginous sheath, with a single mucoid apical appendage while ascospores exhibit a mucoid cap at both ends. Given that many Phyllosticta taxa are cryptic and share similar morphologies, it is arduous to depict taxonomically relevant characters solely on the basis of morphological or ecological features. Coupled with morphological description, multi -locus phylogenetic analyses of species comprising complexes are used to broadly describe this genus and understand species boundaries. Despite several published taxonomic revisions and enumerations of Phyllosticta species, there is still considerable confusion when identifying these taxa. Herein, we establish three new host records for P. capitalensis, and one new geographical record for P. musaechinensis in Thailand, and one new host and geographical record for P. citribrasiliensis in Russia. We provide an updated phylogenetic tree based on several gene markers: ITS, LSU, ACT, GAPDH, RPB2, and TEF-1 alpha. This includes all Phyllosticta species for which sequence data is available. Six individual Phyllosticta species complexes are accepted. In addition, we synonymize P. ericarum with P. citribrasiliensis.","Gomdola, D; Jayawardena, RS; Mckenzie, EHC; Bulgakov, TS; Wanasinghe, DN; Huanraluek, N; Hyde, KV",NA,NA,NA,"Gomdola, Deecksha; Jayawardena, Ruvishika s.; Mckenzie, Eric h. c.; Bulgakov, Timur s.; Wanasinghe, Dhanushka n.; Huanraluek, Naruemon; Hyde, Kevin",NA,"<i>Phyllosticta</i> taxa (Botryosphaeriales, Phyllostictaceae) from northern Thailand and southern European Russia: New host and geographical records","PHYTOTAXA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Bulgakov, Timur/AAC-3761-2020; Wanasinghe, Dhanushka/ITT-1314-2023; Gomdola, Deecksha/GYQ-9426-2022; McKenzie, Eric/ABD-9071-2021; Hyde, Kevin/F-7890-2010; Wanasinghe, Dhanushka/P-1693-2017; Jayawardena, Ruvishika/V-3592-2018","Wanasinghe, Dhanushka/0000-0003-1759-3933; Huanraluek, Naruemon/0000-0003-4814-4735; Jayawardena, Ruvishika/0000-0001-7702-4885; Bulgakov, Timur/0000-0002-4874-6851; McKenzie, Eric/0000-0001-9400-7112",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1179-3155","1179-3163",NA,NA,NA,"FEB 22",2024,"637","3",NA,NA,NA,"211","241",NA,"10.11646/phytotaxa.637.3.1","http://dx.doi.org/10.11646/phytotaxa.637.3.1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001198942200001",NA,5974,"Absence"
"23","Fungal endophytes of the genus Acremonium infect many grass species. They exist in the intercellular spaces of the aerial plant parts, most abundantly in the leaf sheaths. They therefore must obtain all of their nutrients from the apoplastic spaces in the plant. This report is the first comprehensive, biochemically based study of sugar uptake by Acremonium spp. The endophytes (Acremonium typhinum) were isolated from Festuca rubra plants and were grown in culture. Individual colonies were incubated in the presence of [U-C-14] radiolabeled glucose, fructose, or sucrose for 20 minutes and the uptake quantified by scintillation counting. The uptake rates for all three sugars were biphasic, indicating two distinct mechanisms of transport. At low sugar concentrations (below 10 mM) the uptake was saturable and had the characteristics of a carrier-mediated mechanism. At high sugar concentrations (10-100 mM) the uptake was linear suggesting diffusion as the predominant mechanism of uptake. From competition experiments (uptake of labeled sugar in the presence of a different unlabeled sugar) it appeared that there were separate carriers for glucose and fructose. Two mechanisms for sucrose uptake were detected, a sucrose carrier and hexose uptake as a result of cell wall invertase. Cell wall invertase activity of the fungal isolates was inducible by growing the fungi on sucrose containing media.","LAM, CK; BELANGER, FC; WHITE, JF; DAIE, J",NA,NA,NA,"LAM, CK; BELANGER, FC; WHITE, JF; DAIE, J",NA,"MECHANISM AND RATE OF SUGAR UPTAKE BY ACREMONIUM-TYPHINUM, AN ENDOPHYTIC FUNGUS INFECTING FESTUCA-RUBRA - EVIDENCE FOR PRESENCE OF A CELL-WALL INVERTASE IN ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI","MYCOLOGIA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"White, James/C-2280-2009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0027-5514",NA,NA,NA,NA,"MAY-JUN",1994,"86","3",NA,NA,NA,"408","415",NA,"10.2307/3760573","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3760573",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1994NZ04600013",NA,3804,"Absence"

"26","Cool-season grasses establish symbioses with vertically transmitted Neotyphodium endophytes widespread in nature. The frequency of endophyte-infected plants in closed populations (i.e., without migrations) depends on both the differential fitness between infected and non-infected plants, and the endophyte-transmission efficiency. Most studies have been focused on the first mechanism ignoring the second. Infection frequency and endophyte transmission from vegetative tissues to seeds were surveyed in two grasses growing in vegetation units that differ in flood and grazing regimes, and soil salinity. Transmission efficiency and infection frequency for tall fescue did not vary significantly and were 0.98 and 1.00, respectively. For Italian ryegrass, transmission efficiency and infection frequency were 0.88 and 0.57 in humid prairies, and 0.96 and 0.96 in the other vegetation units. Only in humid mesophytic meadows, the observed pattern was irrespective of the presence or absence of grazers. Our results suggest that selection forces for endophyte infection are different for both species. Imperfect transmission was only compensated in tall fescue through an increased fitness of infected plants. Interpreting variations of infection frequency only in terms of differential fitness can be misleading, considering that endophyte transmission can be imperfect and variable in nature. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of measuring transmission efficiency.","Gundel, PE; Garibaldi, LA; Tognetti, PM; Aragón, R; Ghersa, CM; Omacini, M",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro E.; Garibaldi, Lucas A.; Tognetti, Pedro M.; Aragon, Roxana; Ghersa, Claudio M.; Omacini, Marina",NA,"Imperfect Vertical Transmission of the Endophyte <i>Neotyphodium</i> in Exotic Grasses in Grasslands of the Flooding Pampa","MICROBIAL ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tognetti, Pedro/AAF-7018-2019; Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Garibaldi, Lucas/D-7302-2013","Garibaldi, Lucas Alejandro/0000-0003-0725-4049; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Tognetti, Pedro M./0000-0001-7358-1334; Omacini, Marina/0000-0003-1460-262X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0095-3628","1432-184X",NA,NA,NA,"MAY",2009,"57","4",NA,NA,NA,"740","748",NA,"10.1007/s00248-008-9447-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-008-9447-y",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18797956,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000265044900015",NA,1911,"Absence"
"27","A manipulative field study was carried out to determine whether the foliar endophyte fungus, Phialocephala scopiformis DAOM 229536, decreased the performance of eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana larvae developing on white spruce trees. Overwintered second-instar budworm larvae from a laboratory colony or from a wild population were placed on endophyte positive or negative trees one or two weeks before budburst. The presence of the endophyte in the needles reduced the survival of C. fumiferana from both a wild population and a laboratory colony. Survival for budworm juveniles up to pupation and to adult emergence was 13% and 17% lower, respectively, on endophyte positive trees. The endophyte did not influence the size or sex of survivors and budworm survival was not influenced by any two- or three-way interactions. Budworm survival was higher for wild than for laboratory-reared budworm and for budworm placed on trees a week before budburst. This may be the first field study to demonstrate the efficacy of an endophytic fungus against wild individuals of a major forest insect pest. The efficacy of the endophyte at low larval densities suggests that it could be a useful tactic to limit spruce budworm population growth in the context of an early intervention strategy.","Dan, QR; Adams, G; Flaherty, L; McCartney, A; Miller, JD; Edwards, S",NA,NA,NA,"Dan Quiring; Adams, Greg; Flaherty, Leah; McCartney, Andrew; Miller, J.

"28","Morphological and physiological responses to water deficit of two tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) cultivars were compared in a glasshouse experiment and the effect, on those responses, of artificial infection of the tall fescue plants with two fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum) strains was evaluated. The cultivars were Maris Kasba (MK), of Mediterranean origin, and El Palenque (EP), an Argentinian cultivar of temperate origin. The endophyte strains AgResearch isolate (AR501) and the Kentucky (KY31) wild type were compared with nil-endophyte controls. Leaf growth rare of EP plants under water deficit was higher and leaf senescence rate lower than for MK plants (P < 0.05). MK plants showed a greater increase in the proportion of dead leaf tissue than EP plants as water deficit increased (P < 0.05). Stomatal conductance and lamina osmotic adjustment at low soil moisture were lower for MK than EP (P < 0.05). Endophyte-infected plants had a lower dry weight and tiller number, but a higher net growth rate during water deficit treatments than endophyte-free plants (P < 0.05). A significant cultivar x endophyte interaction (P < 0.05) was observed for many variables studied. This implies that any new endophyte strain should be evaluated in combination with the plant genotypes with which it is likely to be associated in commercial practice. MK-KY31 and EP-AR501 associations appeared to tolerate short-term water deficit more effectively than other associations studied. There was evidence that the two endophyte strains studied had different physiological effects on their tall fescue host plants.","Assuero, SG; Matthew, C; Kemp, PD; Latch, GCM; Barker, DJ; Haslett, SJ",NA,NA,NA,"Assuero, SG; Matthew, C; Kemp, PD; Latch, GCM; Barker, DJ; Haslett, SJ",NA,"Morphological and physiological effects of water deficit and endophyte infection on contrasting tall fescue cultivars","NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Barker, David/F-7492-2012; Kemp, Peter/B-4639-2011; Haslett, Stephen/AAX-2672-2021","Assuero, Silvia Graciela/0000-0001-7817-819X; Kemp, Peter/0000-0002-2239-2012; Haslett, Stephen/0000-0002-2775-5468",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0028-8233",NA,NA,NA,NA,"MAR",2000,"43","1",NA,NA,NA,"49","61",NA,"10.1080/00288233.2000.9513408","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00288233.2000.9513408",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000086638800007",NA,5286,"Absence"

"30","Most plants obtain nitrogen through nitrogen-fixing bacteria and microbial decomposition of plant and animal material. Many vascular plants are able to form close symbiotic associations with endophytic fungi. Metarhizium is a common plant endophyte found in a large number of ecosystems. This abundant soil fungus is also a pathogen to a large number of insects, which are a source of nitrogen. It is possible that the endophytic capability and insect pathogenicity of Metarhizium are coupled to provide an active method of nitrogen transfer to plant hosts via fungal mycelia. We used soil microcosms to test the ability of M. robertsii to translocate insect-derived nitrogen to plants. Insects were injected with N-15-labeled nitrogen, and we tracked the incorporation of N-15 into amino acids in two plant species, haricot bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), in the presence of M. robertsii. These findings are evidence that active nitrogen acquisition by plants in this tripartite interaction may play a larger role in soil nitrogen cycling than previously thought.","Behie, SW; Zelisko, PM; Bidochka, MJ",NA,NA,NA,"Behie, S.
