"1","BackgroundTall fescue (Festuca arundinacea [Schreb.], Lolium arundinaceum [Schreb.] Darbysh) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) are important cool-season forage and amenity grasses that have a mutualistic association with an endophytic fungus. Endophytes confer insect and drought resistance to plants but can produce mammalian toxins. Novel endophytes that do not produce mammalian toxins have been introduced to elite cultivars for commercial production. Seed companies need to maintain adequate levels of novel endophytes within the elite forage cultivars. Endophyte detection is performed using immunochemical and molecular techniques because of their speed and reliability. Early detection in seedlings is essential to evaluate the viability of the endophyte within seed lots.MethodsThis research aimed to identify the earliest growth stage in which immunochemical and molecular methods can detect viable endophyte in seedlings of tall fescue cultivars BarOptima (e34), Texoma MaxQII (584), and Jesup MaxQ (542), as well as the perennial ryegrass cultivar Remington (NEA2).ResultsImmunochemical testing detected endophytes in seedlings 14 days after germination (DAG), but the detection rate increased until 42 DAG in some cultivars tested. The molecular marker Tef1exon detected endophytes at a lower rate than the immunochemical method at 28-42 DAG. However, there was insufficient DNA to detect endophytes in 14 DAG seedlings using markers.ConclusionsWe conclude that the most accurate detection of viable endophytes in seedlings was 42 DAG, at which sufficient and consistent endophyte colonization occurred. Many forage grasses have a beneficial fungus living inside them. The presence of this fungus is a necessity to many producers. Knowing when and how to test for it has been a problem in the past. Here, we compare different methods of fungal testing and different time points that will help producers make testing decisions. image","Lee, K; Hill, N; Dela Cerna, C; Missaoui, A",NA,NA,NA,"Lee, Kendall; Hill, Nicholas; Dela Cerna, Chloe; Missaoui, Ali",NA,"Determining the earliest growth stage to detect the presence of endophytes in tall fescue and perennial ryegrass seedlings using molecular markers","GRASSLAND RESEARCH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2097-051X","2770-1743",NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2023,2,"2",NA,NA,NA,"106","111",NA,"10.1002/glr2.12053","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/glr2.12053",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001326028700005",NA,1353,"Absence"
"2","Occurrence of genus Fusarium as endophytes in roots of healthy barley plants cultivated in fields under two levels of phosphorous (P) was examined. F. avenaceum, F. graminearum, F. konzum, F. oxysporum, F. sacchari, F. scirpi, F. solani were isolated from asymptomatic surface sterilized root tissues. F. konzum and F. solani were only present in the roots of fertilized plants, whereas F. sacchari was present in unfertilized plants. F. scirpi was isolated in highest frequency and relative density, and was higher under P deficiency suggesting that P availability would determinate the occurrence of this species, suggesting the possibility of their association with stressed plants. This is the first report on the occurrence of Fusarium spp. as endophytes in healthy barley plants. However, it remains to be determined whether Fusarium spp. isolated are nonpathogenic forms and beneficial to barley plants or latent pathogens that could produce disease symptoms in other conditions.","Echeverria, M; Moreno, MV; Caputo, C",NA,NA,NA,"Echeverria, Mariela; Virginia Moreno, Maria; Caputo, Carla",NA,"Occurrence of <i>Fusarium</i> species in asymptomatic barley plants grown in field conditions under differential phosphate regimes","CURRENT SCIENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Echeverria, Mariela/0000-0002-2844-2498",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0011-3891",NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEP 10",2018,115,"5",NA,NA,NA,"939","944",NA,"10.18520/cs/v115/i5/939-944","http://dx.doi.org/10.18520/cs/v115/i5/939-944",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000443977600034",NA,5534,"Absence"
"3","Studies involving fungal endophytes very often rely on surface-sterilisation of plant samples to enable endophyte isolations. However, surface-sterilisation can be very time-consuming, potentially limiting the number of samples processed. To overcome this limitation, a novel method was developed to bulk surface-sterilise multiple plant tissue samples simultaneously and separately. The method relies on 24 perforated Falcon T tubes, each containing a sample, sequentially transferred through a series of containers holding the sterilants. The samples that can be surface-sterilised using this method include roots, stems and leaves or entire seedlings. This method increased our throughput by a factor of 24 relative to conventional surface-sterilisation methods.","Greenfield, M; Pareja, R; Ortiz, V; Gómez-Jiménez, MI; Vega, FE; Parsa, S",NA,NA,NA,"Greenfield, Melinda; Pareja, Reynaldo; Ortiz, Viviana; Gomez-Jimenez, Maria I.; Vega, Fernando E.; Parsa, Soroush",NA,"A novel method to scale up fungal endophyte isolations","BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Vega, Fernando/AAM-5536-2021","Greenfield, Melinda/0000-0001-6026-7602; Vega, Fernando E./0000-0001-8103-5640",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0958-3157","1360-0478",NA,NA,NA,NA,2015,25,"10",NA,NA,NA,"1208","1212",NA,"10.1080/09583157.2015.1033382","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09583157.2015.1033382",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000355793300008",NA,6931,"Absence"
"4","Non-mycorrhizal but beneficial fungi often mitigate (a)biotic stress-related traits in host plants. The underlying molecular mechanisms are mostly still unknown, as in the interaction between the endophytic growth-promoting soil fungus Mortierella hyalina and Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, abiotic stress in the form of nitrogen (N) deficiency was used to investigate the effects of the fungus on colonized plants. In particular, the hypothesis was investigated that fungal infection could influence N deficiency via an interaction with the high-affinity nitrate transporter NRT2.4, which is induced by N deficiency. For this purpose, Arabidopsis wild-type nrt2.4 knock-out and NRT2.4 reporter lines were grown on media with different nitrate concentrations with or without M. hyalina colonization. We used chemical analysis methods to determine the amino acids and phytohormones. Experimental evidence suggests that the fungus does not modulate NRT2.4 expression under N starvation. Instead, M. hyalina alleviates N starvation in other ways: The fungus supplies nitrogen (N-15) to the N-starved plant. The presence of the fungus restores the plants' amino acid homeostasis, which was out of balance due to N deficiency, and causes a strong accumulation of branched-chain amino acids. We conclude that the plant does not need to invest in defense and resources for growth are maintained, which in turn benefits the fungus, suggesting that this interaction should be considered a mutualistic symbiosis.","Svietlova, N; Reichelt, M; Zhyr, L; Majumder, A; Scholz, SS; Grabe, V; Krapp, A; Oelmüller, R; Mithöfer, A",NA,NA,NA,"Svietlova, Nataliia; Reichelt, Michael; Zhyr, Liza; Majumder, Anindya; Scholz, Sandra S.; Grabe, Veit; Krapp, Anne; Oelmueller, Ralf; Mithoefer, Axel",NA,"The Beneficial Fungus <i>Mortierella hyalina</i> Modulates Amino Acid Homeostasis in Arabidopsis under Nitrogen Starvation","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Krapp, Anne/E-8372-2013; Reichelt, Michael/JFA-0200-2023","Grabe, Veit/0000-0002-0736-2771; Krapp, Anne/0000-0003-2034-5615; Mithofer, Axel/0000-0001-5229-6913; Reichelt, Michael/0000-0002-6691-6500",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1661-6596","1422-0067",NA,NA,NA,"NOV",2023,24,"22",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3390/ijms242216128","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms242216128",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,38003319,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001114555600001",NA,5386,"Absence"
"5","The root diameters as well as colonization and diversity of the root-associating fungi of Vaccinium oldhamii Miq. were investigated in order to obtain information on their mycorrhizal properties. The distal regions of roots had typical hair roots with diameters of less than 100 μm. Ericoid mycorrhizal fungi (ErMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) were frequently observed in the roots. Ascomycetes, particularly helotialean fungi, appeared to be dominant among the endophytic fungi of V. oldhamii roots. Furthermore, Rhizoscyphus ericae (Read) Zhuang & Korf and Oidiodendron maius Barron known as ErMF were detected more frequently than other fungal species. © 2016, Japanese Society of Microbial Ecology.

"6","Tea (Camellia sinensis) and coffee (Coffea arabica) are the most consumed infusion beverages in the world. Each agroecosystem for their productions comes with a rich complex of insect and mite associates, most of which are not regarded as pests. However, a significant number of serious pests attack the leaves, roots, stems, and roots of each crop. The foliage of tea, the marketable part of the plant, is attacked by tortricid moths, hemipterans, and coleopterans. Although Bacillus thuringiensis is the most used microbial control agent of lepidopteran pests of tea, considerable research has been conducted on entomopathogenic viruses, mostly Baculoviruses, for their control and entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) as microbial control agents of hemipteran pests. Coffee plants are attacked by a broad range of insect and mite pests including coleopterans, lepidopterans, hemipterans, and mites. Among these, the coffee berry borer (CBB) is the most economically important pest of coffee worldwide. The EPF, Beauveria bassiana, has been used along with other interventions for its control in Colombia. Exploitation of the endophytic fungi associated with coffee as possible control agents of CBB is discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.","Nakai M.; Lacey L.A.",NA,"",NA,"Nakai, M.

"7","Four species of Diuris temperate terrestrial orchids from wild and captive populations were tested for the presence of polyadenylated RNA viruses. The genomes of three exotic viruses were determined: two potyviruses, Bean yellow mosaic virus and Ornithogalum mosaic virus, and the polerovirus Turnip yellows virus. The genomes of five indigenous viruses were detected, including four novel species. They were the potyvirus Blue squill virus A, another potyvirus, two proposed capilloviruses, and a partitivirus. Partitivirus infection is of interest as this group of viruses is also associated with endophytic fungi (mycorrhizae) that are necessary for the germination, growth, development of many terrestrial orchids. Sequence divergence data indicate post-European, pre-European, and endemic origins for these viruses via inoculum from introduced and native plants. The implications of the findings of this study for orchid conservation, and particularly reintroduction programs where viruses may be spread inadvertently to wild populations from infected propagation sources, are discussed.

"8","Plant-associated microbes contribute to crop health and resilience, potentially extending or complementing plant traits under abiotic stress. Here we tested a series of hypotheses centered on the fungal mycobiome and bacterial microbiome of field-grown sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), an emerging model crop for drought resilience, which we cultivated under arid conditions. Overall, the sorghum mycobiome and microbiome differed in composition between the exterior and interior of plant tissues, between roots and leaves, and among sorghum genotypes. We did not observe variation in fungal and bacterial endophytes among performance classes of sorghum when water was plentiful, but the root endophytic mycobiome and microbiome both shifted markedly under water limitation, with similar shifts in composition observed among multiple plant genotypes. The root endophytic microbiome of high-performing sorghum was especially responsive to water limitation. Network analysis suggested that water limitation did not directly remodel these root endophytic microbiomes, such that interactions of the microbiome with the host plant, rather than interactions among microbes within the microbiome, may be the most dynamic element of change when water is limited. Overall, our study points to shifts in the prevalence of particular taxa under abiotic stress and suggests that high-performing lines may have distinctive features as substrates or strategies for actively recruiting diverse, abundant, and distinctive microbial communities to roots under water limitation. Such findings are important in the arid lands that frame marginal agriculture today and comprise an increasing proportion of agriculture in a changing world.","Garcia, C; Pauli, D; Plecki, C; Alnasser, H; Rozzi, B; Calleja, S; Arnold, AE",NA,NA,NA,"Garcia, Ciara; Pauli, Duke; Plecki, Caroline; Alnasser, Hesham; Rozzi, Bruno; Calleja, Sebastian; Arnold, A.

"9","Tissues from Coffea arabica, C. congensis, C. dewevrei and C. liberica collected in Colombia, Hawaii and at a local plant nursery in Maryland were sampled for the presence of fungal endophytes. Surface sterilized tissues including roots, leaves, stems and various berry parts were plated on yeast-malt agar. DNA was extracted from a set of isolates visually recognized as Penicillium, and the internal transcribed spacer region and partial LSU-rDNA was amplified and sequenced. Comparison of DNA sequences with GenBank and unpublished sequences revealed the presence of 11 known Penicillium species: P. brevicompactum, P. brocae, P. cecidicola, P. citrinum, P. coffeae, P. crustosum, P. janthinellum, P. olsonii, P. oxalicum, P. sclerotiorum and P. steckii as well as two possibly undescribed species near P. diversum and P. roseopurpureum. Ochratoxin A was produced by only four isolates, one isolate each of P. brevicompactum, P. crustosum, P. olsonii and P. oxalicum.

Endophytes were isolated from surface-sterilized needles with culture-free DNA techniques. No significant differences were observed between endophyte communities of slow- and fast-growing clonal origins. However, the endophyte community correlated with the current growth rate of cuttings suggesting that endophytes reflect short- rather than long-term performance of a host. The concentration of condensed tannins was similar in slow- and fast-growing clonal origins but it showed a negative relationship with endophyte species richness, implying that these secondary compounds may play an important role in spruce tolerance against fungal infections. More than a third of endophyte species were detected in both fresh and decomposing needles, indicating that many needle endophytes are facultative saprotrophs. Several potentially pathogenic fungal species were also found within the community of saprotrophic endophytes. © 2014 The British Mycological Society.","Rajala T.; Velmala S.M.; Vesala R.; Smolander A.; Pennanen T.",NA,"",NA,"Rajala, Tiina (55041396000); Velmala, Sannakajsa M.

"11","We present a model for the regulation of endophytes that focuses on the hazard identification and risk assessment components. The goal was to develop a model that can identify and characterise risk, and quantify the level of risk. Our model takes a binary approach, either categorising risk into 'acceptable' or ` unacceptable' levels, as regulators are often left with a choice of approving or declining a proposal when an organism is unable to be contained after it is released. This model provides a framework for practitioners to use in order to identify and quantify the risks and benefits to be derived from endophytes and plants with novel traits systematically. We present two case studies of the model in practice in New Zealand legislation under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms (HSNO) Act, and indicate how the model might be used by researchers and regulators to allow for the safe introduction of new traits for biocontrol.","Bromfield, KE; Corin, S; Atapattu, A",NA,NA,NA,"Bromfield, Kate E.; Corin, Steven; Atapattu, Asela",NA,"A qualitative binary risk assessment model for regulating the biosecurity and environmental risk of endophytes","BIOLOGICAL CONTROL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1049-9644","1090-2112",NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2018,116,NA,NA,NA,NA,"46","52",NA,"10.1016/j.biocontrol.2017.05.002","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocontrol.2017.05.002",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000417035100007",NA,9288,"Absence"

Ergovaline production varied, even within populations. A dendrogram based on microsatellite length polymorphisms separated endophytes of each Festuca species. In addition, Danish E arundinacea endophytes were separate from the other E arundinacea endophytes. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) demonstrated a pronounced genetic variation of F arundinacea endophytes between countries and within the Italian and Spanish locations.

"13","Tall fescue toxicosis and other maladies in livestock result from the ingestion of vasoconstrictive ergot alkaloids produced by fungal endophytes associated symbiotically with the grass. In order to facilitate future analyses of grass extracts considered responsible for outbreak of related livestock diseases, we examined the electrospray ionization mass spectra of specific ergot alkaloids under conditions that permit protonation. Our purposes were both to record the spectra with interpretation of mechanisms of fragmentation and to derive commonalities that would allow the prediction of mass spectra of related compounds for which standards were not readily available. With [M + H] + values in parentheses, water-insoluble lysergic acid peptide ergot derivatives ergovaline (m/z 534), ergotamine (m/z 582), ergocornine (m/z 562), ergocryptine (m/z 576) and ergocrystine (m/z 610) exhibited a consistent loss of water (-18 u) from the C-12′ α-hydroxy functionality. Of this group, ergovaline and ergotamine generated an m/z 320 fragment deriving from cleavage of ring E amide and ether functions with retention of the peptide ring system methyl group. Ergocornine, ergocryptine and ergocrystine similarly formed an m/z 348 fragment with retention of isopropyl. These assignments were supported by the lack of similar fragments from the water-soluble ergot ergonovine, which lacks a peptide ring system. Clavine-type ergot alkaloids lysergic acid and lysergol lack any substituents beyond simple ones directly on the C-8 position and, similarly to ergonovine, lack significant fragments at m/z 268, 251 and 225 shared by the peptide ergot alkaloids.

"14","Profiling the host-mycobiota interactions in healthy vs. diseased forest ecosystems helps understand the dynamics of understudied yet increasingly important threats to forest health that are emerging due to climate change. We analyzed the structural and functional changes of the mycobiota and the responses of Pinus contorta in the Lophodermella needle cast pathosystem through metabarcoding and metatranscriptomics. When needles transitioned from asymptomatic to symptomatic, dysbiosis of the mycobiota occurred, but with an enrichment of Lophodermella pathogens. Many pathogenicity-related genes were highly expressed by the mycobiota at the necrotrophic phase, showing an active pathogen response that are absent in asymptomatic needles. This study also revealed that Lophodermella spp. are members of a healthy needle mycobiota that have latent lifestyles suggesting that other pine needle pathogens may have similar biology.

Further investigation to elucidate the possible antagonistic interplay of other biotic members leading to disease progression and/or suppression is warranted.

"15","AimsPlants, fungal endophytes (FEs) and the changing environment interact with each other forming an interlaced network. This study evaluates nonadditive and interactive effects of the FE Acremonium strictum and drought treatment on Atractylodes lancea plantlets. Methods and ResultsBy applying FEs (meristem cultures of At.lancea, fungal inoculation of Ac.strictum and plantlet acclimatization) and drought treatment (regular watering, mild drought, severe drought), a research system of At.lancea ramets under different treatments was established. During 12days of drought treatment, the plantlets' physiological responses and basic growth traits were measured and analysed. Although drought and FE presence affected plantlet traits to differing degrees, the interactive effects of the two were more pronounced. In particular under mild drought treatment, the FE conferred drought tolerance to plantlets by enhancing leaf soluble sugars, proteins, proline and antioxidant enzyme activity; decreasing the degree of plasmalemma oxidation; and increasing the host's abscisic acid level and root:shoot ratio. When exposed to regular watering or severe drought, these effects were not significant. ConclusionsPlant traits plasticity was conferred by dual effects of drought stress and FEs, and these factors are interactive. Although FEs can help plants cope with drought stress, the beneficial effects are strictly constrained by drought degree. Significance and Impact of the StudyDuring finite environmental stress, FEs can benefit plants, and for this reason, they may alleviate the effects of climate change on plants. However, because the benefits of FEs are highly context dependent, the role of FEs in a changing background should be re-assessed.","Yang, T; Ma, S; Dai, CC",NA,NA,NA,"Yang, T.; Ma, S.; Dai, C.

"17","AimsA fungal endophyte, Neotyphodium uncinatum, accumulates N-formylloline, which is toxic to Hemipteran insects, in Italian ryegrass. This study aimed to clarify the dynamics of N.uncinatum and N-formylloline in Italian ryegrass, and their relationship to insect resistance. Methods and ResultsChanges in the density and localization of N.uncinatum and N-formylloline in N.uncinatum-infected Italian ryegrass were examined by real-time PCR and gas chromatography, respectively. Neotyphodium uncinatum multiplied on pseudostems at the flowering stage, and then increased on inflorescences at the ripening stage. On the other hand, N-formylloline accumulated heavily in inflorescences and leaf blades, but lightly in pseudostems at the ripening stage. In field experiments, N.uncinatum-infected Italian ryegrass suppressed the occurrence of Stenotus rubrovittatus, which fed on the inflorescences, but was not effective to Laodelphax striatellus, which do not necessarily prefer a particular plant tissue. ConclusionLocalization of N.uncinatum and N-formylloline were discordant in Italian ryegrass. The N.uncinatum-infected Italian ryegrass was effective to only insects that prefer to feed on particular plant tissues containing N-formylloline.

"18","Aureobasidium pullulons and Epicoccum nigrum are frequently reported as endophytes of various crops, including grapevine (Vitis vinifera). Because of their potential role as biological control agents against grapevine pathogens, we examined the occurrence of A. pullulans and E. nigrum in two grapevine varieties (Merlot and Prosecco) in Italian vineyards where spontaneous recovery from phytoplasma disease is recurrent. Species-specific primers for A. pullulans and two genetically distinct strains of E. nigrum were designed in variable regions of ITS1 and ITS2. Primer specificity was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction using purified DNA from other fungal endophytes that are usually encountered during isolation attempts from grapevine tissues and from several other strains of A. pullulans and E. nigrum isolated from other sources. In order to determine the occurrence of the two endophytes in grapevine plants, DNA was extracted from shoots of 44 grapevines collected in six vineyards from different localities of northeast Italy. Both endophytes were detected and their identity was confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns obtained from reference strains. RFLP analyses confirmed the presence of two E. nigrum strains belonging to different RFLP groups in grapevine. The molecular methods described allowed a sensitive, specific, and reliable identification of the two endophytes in grapevine.","Martini, M; Musetti, R; Grisan, S; Polizzotto, R; Borselli, S; Pavan, F; Osler, R",NA,NA,NA,"Martini, M.; Musetti, R.; Grisan, S.; Polizzotto, R.; Borselli, S.; Pavan, F.; Osler, R.",NA,"DNA-Dependent Detection of the Grapevine Fungal Endophytes <i>Aureobasidium pullulans</i> and <i>Epicoccum nigrum</i>","PLANT DISEASE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Musetti, Rita/AAK-1282-2020; Grisan, Simone/A-4371-2015","MUSETTI, Rita/0000-0001-8459-0869; Grisan, Simone/0000-0002-3476-4194",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0191-2917","1943-7692",NA,NA,NA,"OCT",2009,93,"10",NA,NA,NA,"993","998",NA,"10.1094/PDIS-93-10-0993","http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PDIS-93-10-0993",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30754374,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000270266400003",NA,1025,"Absence"

"20","Attenuating the Taxol yield of Aspergillus terreus with the subculturing and storage were the technical challenges that prevent this fungus to be a novel platform for industrial Taxol production. Thus, the objective of this study was to unravel the metabolic machineries of A. terreus associated with attenuation of Taxol productivity, and their restoring potency upon cocultivation with the Podocarpus gracilior microbiome. The Taxol yield of A. terreus was drastically reduced with the fungal subculturing. At the 10th subculture, the yield of Taxol was reduced by four folds (78.2 mu g/l) comparing to the original culture (268 mu g/l), as authenticated from silencing of molecular expression of the Taxol-rate limiting enzymes (GGPPS, TDS, DBAT and BAPT) by qPCR analyses. The visual fading of A. terreus conidial pigmentation with the subculturing, revealing the biosynthetic correlation of melanin and Taxol. The level of intracellular acetyl-CoA influx was reduced sequentially with the fungal subculturing, rationalizing the decreasing on Taxol and melanin yields. Fascinatingly, the Taxol biosynthetic machinery and cellular acetyl-CoA of A. terreus have been completely restored upon addition of 3% surface sterilized leaves of P. gracilior, suggesting the implantation of plant microbiome on re-triggering the molecular machinery of Taxol biosynthesis, their transcriptional factors, and/or increasing the influx of Acetyl-CoA. The expression of the proteins of 74.4, 68.2, 37.1 kDa were exponentially suppressed with A. terreus subculturing, and strongly restored upon addition of P. gracilior leaves, ensuring their profoundly correlation with the molecular expression of Taxol biosynthetic genes. From the proteomic analysis, the restored proteins 74.4 kDa of A. terreus upon addition of P. gracilior leaves were annotated as ribosome biogenesis proteins YTM and microtubule-assembly proteins that belong to WD40 superfamily. Thus, further ongoing studies for molecular cloning and expression of these genes with strong promotors in A. terreus, have been initiated, to construct a novel platform of metabolically stable A. terreus for sustainable Taxol production. Attenuating the Taxol yield of A. terreus with the multiple-culturing and storage might be due to the reduction on main influx of acetyl-CoA, or downregulation of ribosome biogenesis proteins that belong to WD40 protein superfamily.","El-Sayed, ASA; Mohamed, NZ; Safan, S; Yassin, MA; Shaban, L; Shindia, AA; Ali, GS; Sitohy, MZ",NA,NA,NA,"El-Sayed, Ashraf S.

"21","Stream ecosystems are affected by multiple abiotic stressors, and species responses to simultaneous stressors may differ from those predicted based on single-stressor responses. Using 12 semi-natural stream channels, we examined the individual and interactive effects of flow level (low or high flow) and addition of fine sediments (grain size <2 mm) on key ecosystem processes (leaf breakdown, algal biomass accrual) and benthic macroinvertebrate and fungal communities. Both stressors had mostly independent effects on biological responses, with sand addition being the more influential of the two. Sand addition decreased algal biomass and microbe-mediated leaf breakdown significantly, whereas invertebrate shredder-mediated breakdown only responded to flow level. Macroinvertebrate community composition responded significantly to both stressors. Fungal biomass decreased and shredder abundance increased when sand was added; thus, organisms at different trophic levels can exhibit highly variable responses to the same stressor. Terrestrial endophytic fungi were abundant in low-flow flumes where leaf mass loss was also highest, indicating that terrestrial endophytes may contribute importantly to leaf decomposition in the aquatic environment. Leaf breakdown rates depended on the identity and abundance of the dominant decomposer species, suggesting that the effects of anthropogenic activities on ecosystem processes may be driven by changes in the abundance of a few key species. The few observed interactive effects were all antagonistic (i.e., less than the sum of the individual effects); for example, increased flow stimulated algal biomass accumulation but this effect was largely cancelled by sand. While our finding that sand and stream flow did not have strong synergistic effects can be considered reassuring for management, future experiments should manipulate these and other human stressors in experiments that run for much longer periods, thus focusing on the long-term impacts of multiple simultaneously operating stressors. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","Mustonen K.-R.; Mykrä H.; Louhi P.; Markkola A.; Tolkkinen M.; Huusko A.; Alioravainen N.; Lehtinen S.; Muotka T.",NA,"",NA,"Mustonen, Kaisa-Riikka (57189442784); Mykrä, Heikki (15925949700); Louhi, Pauliina (18037547400); Markkola, Annamari (7004357278); Tolkkinen, Mikko (54685427500); Huusko, Ari (6701507838); Alioravainen, Nico (55767468100); Lehtinen, Sirkku (57191404865); Muotka, Timo (7003835341)",NA,"Sediments and flow have mainly independent effects on multitrophic stream communities and ecosystem functions","Ecological Applications",NA,NA,"English","Article",NA,"","","",NA,"Aquatic fungi; Benthic invertebrates; Decomposition; Ecosystem functions; Flow variability; Multiple stressors; Sand; Sedimentation; Streams","Animals; Biomass; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Finland; Fungi; Geologic Sediments; Invertebrates; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Plant Leaves; Plants; Rivers; Temperature; Water Movements; algae; Fungi; Invertebrata; nitrogen; phosphorus; abiotic factor; abundance; alga; benthos; biomass allocation; community response; decomposition; ecosystem function; environmental stress; flow velocity; fungus; grain size; human activity; macroinvertebrate; sand; sedimentation; stream; trophic level; animal; biomass; chemistry; classification; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; Finland; fungus; invertebrate; physiology; plant; plant leaf; procedures; river; sediment; temperature; water flow","Mustonen K.-R., Thule Institute, University of Oulu, P.O.

"22","This essay considers the political economy of transnational scientific research based on global collection of biota for laboratory manipulation, focusing on a program to develop pest-resistant wheat using fungal endophytes common in a range of wild but closely related grasses. This effort extends long-standing efforts to commoditize living substances of increasing scope and complexity, and it is supported by efforts to collect and preserve biological diversity. The essay explores how imperatives of capital shape biodiversity as a policy category and determine which forms of life are saved, materially altering our records of life on earth. These newly legible and malleable organisms become more perfect commodities, suitable for standardization and transmutation into finance capital. Yet endophytes are also of interest in part because of their resistance to such control, throwing into sharp relief the reductive imperatives of commoditization while also provoking new ways of justifying capital accumulation and flow. This essay questions the extent to which histories of capitalism and science as conjoined projects rooted in the biological species concept can explain contemporary practices of biodiversity preservation and the microbiological research they support. Microbiological research provides new renderings of life on earth that may challenge or reconfigure metaphors and practices common to capitalism and science.","Fullilove, C",NA,NA,NA,"Fullilove, Courtney",NA,"Microbiology and the Imperatives of Capital in International Agro-Biodiversity Preservation","OSIRIS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0369-7827","1933-8287",NA,NA,NA,NA,2018,33,"1",NA,NA,NA,"294","318",NA,"10.1086/699993","http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/699993",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000448475600015",NA,8500,"Absence"
"23","Horn flies, Haematobia irritans irritans (L.), and stable flies, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.) (Diptera: Muscidae), are economically important blood-feeding ectoparasites of wild and domesticated animals, including cattle, Bos taurus L. Conventional insecticides are used for control of biting flies on cattle, but safety concerns and the buildup of insecticide resistance indicate the need for alternative control tactics. Many botanical extracts and oils are composed of more than one bioactive compound that can exert different modes of action, delaying or averting resistance. Plant genera that have shown repellency and toxicity against horn flies and stable flies include Allium, Azadirachta, Chrysanthemum, Cinnamomum, Cymbopogon, Derris, Eucalyptus, Festuca, Melaleuca, Melinus, Mentha, Nepeta, Nicotiana, Pelargonium, Pogostemon, Ricinus, Rosa, Syzygium, Vitex, and Zyloxanthum. Other botanically based methods for biting fly control have been investigated, such as the use of fatty acids, soybean trypsin inhibitors, and fungal endophytes on forage grasses. Many of the plant-based control methods have been shown to have strong effects against the two biting fly species, but work has only just begun on identifying and, in particular, developing botanically based tactics.","Showler, AT",NA,NA,NA,"Showler, Allan T.",NA,"Botanically Based Repellent and Insecticidal Effects Against Horn Flies and Stable Flies (Diptera: Muscidae)","JOURNAL OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2155-7470",NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2017,8,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1093/jipm/pmx010","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jipm/pmx010",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000419281300013",NA,4154,"Absence"
"24","Patterned vegetation growth such as grass rings is found in many arid ecosystems, yet the mechanisms behind their formation are often unknown and have been minimally tested in the field. One explanation is pathogen accumulation in the center of a long-lived plant, which could cause central dieback and the formation of a ring as the plant grows toward pathogen-free soil. We tested this mechanism by comparing the growth of blue grama grass (Bouteloua gracilis) in live and sterilized soils from inside or outside naturally occurring grass rings. Field collected roots from the inner edge of grass rings had higher fungal colonization than roots from the outer edge, suggesting the potential for intensified pathogen interactions on the inside of rings. However, while plants grown in live soils performed worse than those in sterile soils, this pathogenic effect did not differ between soils collected from inside versus outside of grass rings. Further work on the spatial distribution of plant-microbe interactions is needed to confirm their direct role in ring formation. Our findings suggest that soil and root microbes, in addition to known mechanisms such as soil hydrology, potentially promote ring formation of a widespread North American grass species.","Carlton, L; Duncritts, NC; Chung, YA; Rudgers, JA",NA,NA,NA,"Carlton, Lance; Duncritts, Nora C.; Chung, Y.

"25","Catharanthus roseus produces medicinally important terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) such as vindoline, vinblastine, and vincristine, but in very small amounts. The various microbial consortium consisting of plant growth-promoting and alkaloid enhancing endophytes were developed in order to enhance the overall productivity of such pharmaceutically important alkaloids. Furthermore, we attempted to identify the endophytic consortia suitable to maximally improve the content and yield of TIAs in field-grown C. roseus cultivars during the winter and summer seasons. The consortium, CATDLF5 + CATPS2 (Curvularia sp.+Bacillus pumilis), improves leaf weight in all C. roseus cultivars during winter and summer. On the alkaloids front, the consortium, CATDLF5 + CATPS2, maximally enhanced the vindoline content and yield in C. roseus cvs. Prabal and Nirmal during both winter and summer seasons; but different consortia were effective for improving vindoline content and yield in cv. Dhawal during different seasons. Whereas co-inoculation of CATDLF6 + CATPR13 (Choanephora infundibulifera + Paenibacillus sp.) and CATDLF5 + CATPS2 consortium maximally enhanced vindoline content and yield, respectively, in C. roseus cv. Dhawal during winter; but during summer, CATDLF6 + V3 (Choanephora infundibulifera + Micrococcus sp.) maximally increased both vindoline content and yield in C. roseus cv. Dhawal. The presence of vincristine and vinblastine are maximally detected in C. roseus plants during summer season. The consortium of CATDLF5 + CATPR13 (Curvularia sp. + Paenibacillus sp.) maximally enhanced the content as well as yield of vincristine and vinblastine in C. roseus cvs. Prabal and Nirmal plants, while CATDLF6 + CATPR13 inoculation showed maximal improvement in the content and yield of vinblastine and vincristine in C. roseus cv. Dhawal plants. This study identifies the best combination of endophytes that can maximize the plant growth and TIAs yield in various C. roseus plant cultivars under field conditions for both winter and summer seasons.","Singh, S; Pandey, SS; Tiwari, R; Pandey, A; Shanker, K; Kalra, A",NA,NA,NA,"Singh, Sucheta; Pandey, Shiv S.; Tiwari, Rashmi; Pandey, Alok; Shanker, Karuna; Kalra, Alok",NA,"Endophytic consortium with growth-promoting and alkaloid enhancing capabilities enhance key terpenoid indole alkaloids of Catharanthus roseus in the winter and summer seasons","INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"PANDEY, ALOK/AAE-3921-2022; Pandey, Shiv Shanker/GSD-9059-2022; Shanker, Karuna/D-3596-2009","Pandey, Shiv Shanker/0000-0001-9730-2547; singh, sucheta/0000-0003-2470-2114; Pandey, Alok/0000-0001-5634-5911; Kalra, Alok/0000-0002-3314-0179",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0926-6690","1872-633X",NA,NA,NA,"AUG",2021,166,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.113437","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indcrop.2021.113437",NA,"MAR 2021",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000649653100006",NA,1630,"Absence"
"26","Various endophytic fungi of native plants and crops are important entomopathogens. The objective of this study was to investigate the entomopathogenic action of Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin, Metarhizium robertsii (Metchnikoff) Sorokin, and Isaria fumosorosea (Wize) Brown & Smith (all Ascomycota: Hypocreales) against larvae of Sesamia nonagrioides (Lefebvre) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) artificially introduced into Sorghum bicolor L. (Moench) (Poaceae) plants under natural environmental conditions. Sorghum bicolor is an economically important crop cultivated for grain, fiber, forage, and lately for biofuel, and S.nonagrioides is its main pest in Mediterranean areas. Young sorghum plants were inoculated with the entomopathogens by spraying in the field. Plant water status, chlorophyll concentration, photosynthesis, and transpiration were not affected. Thirty days after endophyte establishment, plants were infested with fourth instars of S.nonagrioides. The endophytes prevented 50-70% of larvae from entering stalks. Larval mortality was 70-100% and tunnel lengths were reduced by 60-87%. Larval infestation resulted in reduced electron transport capacity and net photosynthetic rate, which was ameliorated in the presence of I.fumosorosea and reversed by B.bassiana and M.robertsii. The growth of sorghum was unaffected in all treatments during the experimental period. Beauveria bassiana and M.robertsii can protect sweet sorghum from damage induced by S.nonagrioides under natural environmental conditions without affecting plant physiology and growth.","Mantzoukas, S; Chondrogiannis, C; Grammatikopoulos, G",NA,NA,NA,"Mantzoukas, Spiridon; Chondrogiannis, Christos; Grammatikopoulos, George",NA,"Effects of three endophytic entomopathogens on sweet sorghum and on the larvae of the stalk borer <i>Sesamia nonagrioides</i>","ENTOMOLOGIA EXPERIMENTALIS ET APPLICATA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Chondrogiannis, Christos/ITA-1893-2023; Mantzoukas, Spiros/H-9306-2019","Chondrogiannis, Christos/0000-0003-4586-5537; Mantzoukas, Spiridon/0000-0002-5792-6221",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0013-8703","1570-7458",NA,NA,NA,"JAN",2015,154,"1",NA,NA,NA,"78","87",NA,"10.1111/eea.12262","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eea.12262",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000346487700010",NA,9151,"Absence"
"27","Nomenclatural rule changes in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi and plants, adopted at the 18th International Botanical Congress in Melbourne, Australia, in 2011, provide for a single name to be used for each fungal species. The anamorphs of Epichloe species have been classified in genus Neotyphodium, the form genus that also includes most asexual Epichloe descendants. A nomenclatural realignment of this monophyletic group into one genus would enhance a broader understanding of the relationships and common features of these grass endophytes. Based on the principle of priority of publication we propose to classify all members of this clade in the genus Epichloe: We have reexamined classification of several described Epichloe and Neotyphodium species and varieties and propose new combinations and states.

"28","Biodiversity research rapidly progresses due to the continuous improvement of high-throughput analysis platforms, which facilitate detailed analyses of the composition and architecture of microbial communities in various environmental niches. In the fields of applied forestry and agriculture, microbial communities are also increasingly considered, because they are involved in various kinds of biotic interactions with plants and therefore have high diagnostic value for assessing the health status of plants and soils. While in-depth identification of microbial species in environmental samples is currently achieved by next generation sequencing or microarray techniques, profiling of whole microbial communities can be accomplished via less labor-intensive approaches. We modified the protocol for automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) by targeting length polymorphism of the fungal ITS1 rRNA gene for a rapid diagnostic assessment of fungal community composition and surveyed its application spectrum. The approach allowed for spatial and temporal differentiation among fungal assemblages in soil samples and different plant species, and is therefore particularly useful for environmental screening and monitoring projects. Standardized experimental conditions permit the cumulative gathering of data, for instance during long-term projects.","Weig, AR; Persoh, D; Werner, S; Betzlbacher, A; Rambold, G",NA,NA,NA,"Weig, Alfons R.; Persoh, Derek; Werner, Sebastian; Betzlbacher, Amelie; Rambold, Gerhard",NA,"Diagnostic assessment of mycodiversity in environmental samples by fungal ITS1 rDNA length polymorphism","MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Weig, Alfons/I-5359-2013; Persoh, Derek/G-4527-2010","Weig, Alfons/0000-0001-8712-7060; Persoh, Derek/0000-0001-5561-0189",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1617-416X","1861-8952",NA,NA,NA,"NOV",2013,12,"4",NA,NA,NA,"719","725",NA,"10.1007/s11557-012-0883-1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11557-012-0883-1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000325710900012",NA,1461,"Absence"

We have developed a successful research pipeline for the production of a reliable, consistent and environmentally targeted fungal endophyte seed-delivered inoculant for barley cultivars. Our approach was developed de novo from an initial concept to source candidate endophyte inoculants from a wild relative of barley, Hordeum murinum (wall barley). A careful screening and selection procedure and extensive controlled environment testing of fungal endophyte strains, followed by multi-year field trials has resulted in the validation of an endophyte consortium suitable for barley crops grown on relatively dry sites. Our approach can be adapted for any crop or environment, provided that the set of first principles we have developed is followed.

"31","Fungal symbioses with plants are ubiquitous, ancient, and vital to both ecosystem function and plant health. However, benefits to fungal symbionts are not well explored, especially in non-mycorrhizal fungi. The Foraging Ascomycete hypothesis proposes that some wood-decomposing fungi may shift life-history strategies to endophytism to bridge gaps in time and space between suitable substrates. To test this hypothesis we examine spatial relationships of Xylaria endophytic fungi in the forest canopy with Xylaria decomposer fungi on the forest floor. We sampled for fungi of the genus Xylaria using a spatially explicit sampling scheme in a remote Ecuadorian cloud forest, and concurrently carried out an extensive culture-based sampling of fungal foliar endophytes. We found 36 species of Xylaria in our 0.5ha plot, 31 of which were found to only occur as fruiting bodies. All five species of Xylaria found as endophytes were also found as fruiting bodies. We also tested the relationships of both stages of these fungi to environmental variables. Decomposer fungi were differentiated by species-specific habitat preferences, with three species being found closer to water than expected by chance. In contrast, endophytes displayed no sensitivity to environmental conditions, such as host, moisture, or canopy cover. We found evidence of spatial linkage between life stages in two species. We also demonstrate that direct transmission of endophytes from leaves to woody substrates is possible. These results indicate that endophytism may represent one way for decomposer fungi to escape moisture limitation, and thatendophytic fungi may act as sources of dispersal for decomposer fungi consistent with predictions of the Foraging Ascomycete hypothesis. Resumen Las simbiosis de plantas con hongos son ubicuas, ancestrales y vitales tanto para funciones ecosistemicas como para la salud de las plantas. Sin embargo, los beneficios a los hongos simbiontes no estan bien explorados, especialmente en hongos no micorrizicos. En este estudio examinamos las relaciones espaciales entre hongos endofitos del genero Xylaria en el dosel con los miembros descomponedores del mismo genero en el suelo, para probar la hipotesis de que algunos hongos poseen estrategias de historia de vida alternas, alternando entre estadios de vida descomponedores y endofitos para aumentar su dispersion y resistir escasez de recursos, conocida como la Hipotesis del Ascomiceto Forrajero. Muestreamos miembros del genero Xylaria usando un muestreo espacial explicito en un bosque de niebla remoto en Ecuador, y llevamos a cabo un muestreo extensivo de hongos endofitos foliares usando cultivos. Encontramos 36 especies de Xylaria en nuestro sitio de 0.5ha. De estas, 31 especies estuvieron presentes solamente como hongos descomponedores. Asimismo, todos los Xylaria endofitos fueron encontrados fueron encontrados como descomponedores. Evaluamos las relaciones entre ambos estadios de estos hongos con variables ambientales. Los hongos descomponedores se diferenciaron por preferencias de habitat especificas para cada especie, pero los endofitos no mostraron sensibilidad a condiciones ambientales, como humedad o cobertura del dosel. Encontramos evidencia de vinculacion espacial entre los estadios de vida en dos especies. En conjunto, nuestros resultados indican que el endofitismo podria representar un medio de escape de los hongos descomponedores a las limitaciones de humedad, y que los hongos endofitos pueden actuar como fuentes de dispersion para los hongos descomponedores, apoyando la Hipotesis del Ascomiceto Forrajero.","Thomas, DC; Vandegrift, R; Ludden, A; Carroll, GC; Roy, BA",NA,NA,NA,"Thomas, Daniel C.; Vandegrift, Roo; Ludden, Ashley; Carroll, George C.; Roy, Bitty A.",NA,"Spatial Ecology of the Fungal Genus <i>Xylaria</i> in a Tropical Cloud Forest","BIOTROPICA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Roy, Barbara (â€˜Bitty""/HZJ-1032-2023","Roy, Bitty A./0000-0003-1666-5624; Thomas, Daniel/0000-0002-5260-0994; Vandegrift, Roo/0000-0002-1024-2391",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0006-3606","1744-7429",NA,NA,NA,"MAY",2016,48,"3",NA,NA,NA,"381","393",NA,"10.1111/btp.12273","http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/btp.12273",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000375065200013",NA,3825,"Absence"
"32","Aims Symbiotic relationships between fungal endophytes and grass species are known to increase stress resistance in the grass host; however, there is little evidence to suggest that the positive effects occur early in the grass life cycle. In this study, we explored the effects of the endophyte Epichloe festucae on the growth and survival of Festuca eskia seedlings under drought and frequent cutting stress. Methods Festuca eskia seedlings were collected from the western part of the plant repartition area in a non-symbiotic population located in a mesic and heavily grazed site (W-NS) and from the eastern part in a symbiotic population from a xeric and lightly grazed site (E-S). The E-S population was experimentally freed from its endophyte (E-F). Two greenhouse experiments were conducted to compare growth and survival between the three seedling types under drought stress and frequent cutting. In the first experiment, 126 seedlings per seedling type (n = 378) were grown for 6 weeks under non-limiting conditions before the cessation of watering. After 3 weeks without irrigation, full irrigation was restored for 10 days to measure the survival rate. Leaf length, leaf elongation rate and survival rate were assessed per population. In the second experiment, 156 seedlings per seedling type (n = 468) were grown under non-limiting conditions. All seedlings were cut to 3 cm high, twice a week, during the first month of growth. Leaf elongation and tillering were monitored on 52 seedlings per seedling type. For each type, seedling survival rate was determined by the number of plants alive after 10 days of regrowth, without cutting. Important Findings The drought experiment revealed a phenotypic differentiation to drought in 30 F. eskia populations, suggesting adaptive differentiation: the eastern seedlings showed the highest survival rate. A trade-off between growth and survival was highlighted: the highest drought survival rate was associated with the lowest leaf elongation rate under non-limiting water conditions. Endophyte presence in the eastern population increased seedling drought survival. In contrast, cutting survival rate was similar between W-NS and E-S because the presence of the endophyte increased seedling survival to frequent cutting. However, this positive effect came with a cost: the endophyte reduced seedling tillering rate.","Gibert, A; Hazard, L",NA,NA,NA,"Gibert, Anais; Hazard, Laurent",NA,"Endophyte infection of <i>Festuca eskia</i> enhances seedling survival to drought and cutting at the expense of clonal expansion","JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"; Gibert, Anais/E-5005-2018","Hazard, Laurent/0000-0002-0538-8214; Gibert, Anais/0000-0003-2924-2380",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1752-9921","1752-993X",NA,NA,NA,"DEC",2011,4,"4",NA,NA,NA,"201","208",NA,"10.1093/jpe/rtr009","http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jpe/rtr009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000298039000002",NA,555,"Absence"

The wild crucifer species Lepidium campestre (L.) R.Br., Arabis lyrata L., and Erysimum menziesii ssp. eurekense R.A. Price were chosen as models to test this hypothesis. Detection of the parasite in asymptomatic host tissue was based on polymerase chain reaction amplification of ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region I of A. candida using primers designed to discriminate between plant and parasite DNA template. Albugo candida was detected in high proportions of asymptomatic field plants (vegetative and reproductive), greenhouse grown vegetative rosettes, and laboratory germinated seedlings of each species. For example, A. candida appeared to be systemic in all 20 field plants and 10 inoculated rosettes of L, campestre. Albugo candida was present in uninoculated rosettes and seedlings (up to 98%) suggesting seed borne transmission of the pathogen. Although the parameters controlling symptom development are still unclear, presence of the pathogen appeared not to be sufficient for symptom expression. Persistent, asymptomatic, systemic infections that are vertically transmitted through seed suggest that A. candida may possibly form endophytic relationships with at least some of its crucifer hosts.","Jacobson, DJ; LeFebvre, SH; Ojerio, RS; Berwald, N; Heikkinen, E",NA,NA,NA,"Jacobson, DJ; LeFebvre, SH; Ojerio, RS; Berwald, N; Heikkinen, E",NA,"Persistent, systemic, asymptomatic infections of <i>Albugo candida</i>, an oomycete parasite, detected in three wild crucifer species","CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0008-4026",NA,NA,NA,NA,"MAY",1998,76,"5",NA,NA,NA,"739","750",NA,"10.1139/b98-039","http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/b98-039",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000076135800003",NA,3341,"Absence"
"34","Heritable symbionts are often observed at intermediate prevalence within host populations, despite expectations that positive fitness feedbacks should drive beneficial symbionts to fixation. Intermediate prevalence may reflect neutral dynamics of symbionts with weak fitness effects, transient dynamics of symbionts trending towards fixation (or elimination), or a stable intermediate outcome determined by the balance of fitness effects and failed symbiont transmission. Theory suggests that these outcomes should depend on symbiont-conferred demographic effects and vertical transmission efficiency, which may both depend on environmental context. We established experimental populations of winter bent grass Agrostis hyemalis across a range of prevalence of the heritable fungal endophyte Epichloe amarillans. Using irrigation, we elevated the precipitation for half of the populations, which we hypothesized would weaken the benefits of symbiosis. Across two annual transitions, we assayed 5,485 individuals to determine prevalence and censused 954 individuals for demographic (survival, flowering, reproduction and recruitment) and vertical transmission data. We used hierarchical Bayesian models to infer long-run equilibria from short-term changes in symbiont prevalence and estimated demographic vital rates to link individual-level effects to population-level outcomes. We found evidence for all three proposed mechanisms for intermediate symbiont prevalence, but the outcome differed qualitatively across years and precipitation treatments. In the first year, symbionts trended towards fixation under drought conditions but drifted neutrally under elevated precipitation. Fixation likely arose from symbiont-conferred recruitment benefits outweighing reproductive costs under the drought conditions, while elevated precipitation tempered these effects. In the second transition year, we inferred stable intermediate prevalence across both precipitation treatments, which indicated a balance between symbiont conferred recruitment benefits that allowed low-prevalence populations to increase and imperfect transmission that caused high-prevalence populations to decrease. Synthesis. We find support for neutral, transient and stable mechanisms underlying symbiont prevalence, indicating that symbiont prevalence is often pushed and pulled in different directions by the composite outcome of symbiont effects on demographic rates and transmission efficiency, and the way in which these processes respond to environmental context.","Donald, ML; Bohner, TF; Kolis, KM; Shadow, RA; Rudgers, JA; Miller, TEX",NA,NA,NA,"Donald, Marion L.; Bohner, Teresa F.; Kolis, Kory M.; Shadow, R.

"35","Despite being well adapted to the long seasonal droughts of the Mediterranean Basin, the holm oak (Quercus ilex L. subsp. ballota (Desf.) Samp.) has undergone a gradual decline during the last decades. The reasons of this decline are not fully understood, but evidence suggests that the quality and quantity of the interactions of holm oaks with the soil microbiota are playing a central role in the resilience of this species. With the aim to test the previous statement as our hypothesis, 9 oak savannah sites (called dehesas from here on) were sampled, in which asymptomatic (healthy) and symptomatic (early stage of decline) trees were interspersed. Using high throughput amplicon sequencing, soil bacterial and fungal biota (called soil microbiota from here on) were sequenced. Our results showed that soil fungal community composition differed between healthy and declining trees whereas bacterial communities did not show significant differences. Specifically, the degree of holm-oak defoliation was negatively correlated to the relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi and fungal endophytes, suggesting a relation between trees' health and soil fungal symbionts. Although our observational study cannot give a final answer to the directionality of the relationships observed, our results support the idea that small changes in symbiont abundance might be causing holm oaks to lose their ability to withstand the strong environmental pressures.","Garrastatxu, J; Odriozola, I; Esteban, R; Encinas-Valero, M; Morais, DK; Vetrovsky, T; Yuste, JC",NA,NA,NA,"Garrastatxu, Jon; Odriozola, Inaki; Esteban, Raquel; Encinas-Valero, Manuel; Morais, Daniel Kumazawa; Vetrovsky, Tomas; Yuste, Jorge Curiel",NA,"Fungal symbionts associate with holm oak tree health in declining oak savannas of the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula","APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Encinas Valero, Manuel/GWZ-2055-2022; Odriozola, Iñaki/AAE-2017-2019; Yuste, Jorge/F-1712-2017",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0929-1393","1873-0272",NA,NA,NA,"MAR",2024,195,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1016/j.apsoil.2023.105210","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsoil.2023.105210",NA,"NOV 2023",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:001166193200001",NA,2034,"Absence"

At Banks Island, AM fungi were present and colonized at a high intensity in all specimens of Potentilla hookeriana Lehm. - Potentilla pulchella R.Br., Arnica angustifolia Vahl, and Erigeron uniflorus L. ssp. eriocephalus (Vahl ex Hornen.)

"38","The core microbiota of plants exerts key effects on plant performance and resilience to stress. The aim of this study was to identify the core endophytic mycobiome in U. minor stems and disentangle associations between its composition and the resistance to Dutch elm disease (DED). We also defined its spatial variation within the tree and among distant tree populations. Stem samples were taken i) from different heights of the crown of a 168-year-old elm tree, ii) from adult elm trees growing in a common garden and representing a gradient of resistance to DED, and iii) from trees growing in two distant natural populations, one of them with varying degrees of vitality. Endophyte composition was profiled by high throughput sequencing of the first internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1) of the ribosomal DNA. Three families of yeasts (Buckleyzymaceae, Trichomeriaceae and Bulleraceae) were associated to DED-resistant hosts. A small proportion (10%) of endophytic OTUs was almost ubiquitous throughout the crown while tree colonization by most fungal taxa followed stochastic patterns. A clear distinction in endophyte composition was found between geographical locations. By combining all surveys, we found evidence of a U. minor core mycobiome, pervasive within the tree and ubiquitous across locations, genotypes and health status.","Macaya-Sanz, D; Witzell, J; Collada, C; Gil, L; Martin, JA",NA,NA,NA,"Macaya-Sanz, David; Witzell, Johanna; Collada, Carmen; Gil, Luis; Martin, Juan A.",NA,"Core endophytic mycobiome in <i>Ulmus minor</i> and its relation to Dutch elm disease resistance","FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Macaya-Sanz, David/H-1041-2012; Martín, Juan/B-9729-2012; Gil, Luis/E-3216-2014; Collada, Carmen/H-1529-2015; Witzell, Johanna/H-9987-2019",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-462X",NA,NA,NA,NA,"FEB 28",2023,14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.3389/fpls.2023.1125942","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1125942",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,36925756,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000949046100001",NA,7403,"Absence"
"39","This paper reports the use of molecular methods to characterize the coprophilous fungal communities (CFC) that inhabit the dung of four species of mammalian herbivores at two sites, Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR) in New Mexico and Wind Cave National Park (WCNP) in South Dakota. Results reveal that CFC from domesticated cattle (Bos taurus) at SNWR, and bison (Bison bison) and black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) at WCNP were diverse but dominated primarily by members within eight taxonomic orders, including the rarely cultured and anaerobic order Neocallimastigales. In addition, 7.7% (138 of 1,788) of the sequences obtained from all dung samples were at least 97% similar to root-associated fungal (RAF) sequences previously described from blue grama (Bouteloua gracilis), a common forage grass found throughout North America and growing at both study sites. In contrast, 95.8% (295 of 308) of the sequences and four of the total seven operational taxonomic units obtained from pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) dung belonged to the Pleosporalean order. We hypothesize that some herbivore vectors disperse non-systemic (non-clavicipitaceous) fungal endophytes. These dispersal events, it is argued, are most likely to occur via herbivores that occasionally forage and masticate root tissue, especially in arid regions where aboveground vegetation is sparse. The results of this study suggest that some (possibly many) members of the RAF community can expand their ecological role to include colonizing dung. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Herrera J.; Poudel R.; Khidir H.H.",NA,"",NA,"Herrera, José (7201650153); Poudel, Ravin (38461528100); Khidir, Hana H.

"40","To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the resistance to smut of different sugarcane cultivars, endophytic bacterial and fungal compositions, functions and metabolites in the stems of the sugarcane cultivars were analyzed using high-throughput sequencing techniques and nontargeted metabolomics. The results showed that the levels of ethylene, salicylic acid and jasmonic acid in sugarcane varieties that were not sensitive to smut were all higher than those in sensitive sugarcane varieties. Moreover, endophytic fungi, such as Ramichloridium, Alternaria, Sarocladium, Epicoccum, and Exophiala species, could be considered antagonistic to sugarcane smut. Additionally, the highly active arginine and proline metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and tyrosine metabolism in sugarcane varieties that were not sensitive to smut indicated that these pathways contribute to resistance to smut. All of the above results suggested that the relatively highly abundant antagonistic microbes and highly active metabolic functions of endophytes in non-smut-sensitive sugarcane cultivars were important for their relatively high resistance to smut.","Chen, SY; Chen, ZL; Lin, XR; Zhou, XY; Yang, SD; Tan, HW",NA,NA,NA,"Chen, Siyu; Chen, Zhongliang; Lin, Xinru; Zhou, Xinyan; Yang, Shangdong; Tan, Hongwei",NA,"Why different sugarcane cultivars show different resistant abilities to smut?

"42","Some plant species within the Convolvulaceae (morning glory family) from South America, Africa, and Australia cause a neurologic disease in grazing livestock caused by swainsonine. These convolvulaceous species including Ipomoea carnea contain the indolizidine alkaloid swainsonine, an inhibitor of alpha-mannosidase and mannosidase II, and polyhydroxy nortropane alkaloids, the calystegines which are glycosidase inhibitors. Swainsonine has been shown to be produced by a fungal endosymbiont in legumes of the Astragalus and Oxytropis genera, where it causes a similar neurologic disease in grazing livestock called locoism. Here we demonstrate that I. carnea plants are infected with a fungal endosymbiont that was cultured from its seeds and which produced swainsonine in pure culture but not the calystegines. The same fungal endosymbiont was detected by PCR and by culturing in I. carnea plants containing swainsonine. The fungal endosymbiont belongs to the Ascomycete order Chaetothyriales. Plants derived from fungicide-treated seeds lacked swainsonine, but calystegine concentrations were unaltered.","Cook, D; Beaulieu, WT; Mott, IW; Riet-Correa, F; Gardner, DR; Grum, D; Pfister, JA; Clay, K; Marcolongo-Pereira, C",NA,NA,NA,"Cook, Daniel; Beaulieu, Wesley T.; Mott, Ivan W.; Riet-Correa, Franklin; Gardner, Dale R.; Grum, Daniel; Pfister, James A.; Clay, Keith; Marcolongo-Pereira, Clairton",NA,"Production of the Alkaloid Swainsonine by a Fungal Endosymbiont of the Ascomycete Order Chaetothyriales in the Host <i>Ipomoea carnea</i>","JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Clay, Keith/C-8730-2012; Marcolongo-Pereira, Clairton/G-1567-2014; Beaulieu, Wesley/A-9298-2013","Marcolongo-Pereira, Clairton/0000-0002-5593-3110; Beaulieu, Wesley/0000-0002-0082-1242",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0021-8561","1520-5118",NA,NA,NA,"APR 24",2013,61,"16",NA,NA,NA,"3797","3803",NA,"10.1021/jf4008423","http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jf4008423",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,23547913,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000318204700005",NA,6838,"Absence"
"43","Fusarium diseases pose a severe global threat to major cereal crops, particularly wheat. Existing biocontrol strains against Fusarium diseases are believed to primarily rely on antagonistic mechanisms, but not widely used under field conditions. Here, we report an endophytic fungus, Purpureocillium lilacinum YZ1, that shows promise in combating wheat Fusarium diseases. Under glasshouse conditions, YZ1 inoculation increased the survival rate of Fusarium graminearum (Fg)-infected wheat seedlings from 0% to > 60% at the seedling stage, and reduced spikelet infections by 70.8% during anthesis. In field trials, the application of YZ1 resulted in an impressive 89.0% reduction in Fg-susceptible spikelets. While a slight antagonistic effect of YZ1 against Fg was observed on plates, the induction of wheat systemic resistance by YZ1, which is distantly effective, non-specific, and long-lasting, appeared to be a key contributor to YZ1's biocontrol capabilities. Utilizing three imaging methods, we confirmed YZ1 as a potent endophyte capable of rapid colonization of wheat roots, and systematically spreading to the stem and leaves. Integrating dual RNA-Seq, photosynthesis measurements and cell wall visualization supported the link between YZ1's growth-promoting abilities and the activation of wheat systemic resistance. In conclusion, endophytes such as YZ1, which exhibits non-antagonistic mechanisms, hold significant potential for industrial-scale biocontrol applications. © 2024 The Author(s).

"44","Aquatic hyphomycetes play a key role in leaf litter decomposition and are mediators of organic matter turnover in streams. Molecular studies have shown that some aquatic fungi are also plant endophytes, however, more evidence is needed to evaluate their multiple ecological abilities. To date, little information is available on fungal lineages that might have undergone convergent evolution to adapt to multiple ecological modes. We examined the phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary divergences of aquatic hyphomycetes, endophytic aquatic hyphomycetes and other fungal endophytes of riparian/terrestrial plants by analyzing ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 sequences retrieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Sequences with close phylogenetic affinity to aquatic fungi can occur as endophytes of terrestrial plants or in soil far from streams. To fully understand the ecological impact of aquatic hyphomycetes, we need to document and interpret their niches more broadly. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.
