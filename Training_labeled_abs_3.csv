"1","Presence","Endophytic fungi have roles to protect the plant from herbivorous insects and diseases, and to support the absorption process of nutrients needed by plants for photosynthesis. Related to the important role of endophytic fungi, research was aimed to identify fungal endophytes associated with young, mature and old leaves on apple and to evaluate the effect of leaf ages on the abundance and diversity of endophytic fungi. The research was conducted in Biological Control Laboratory, Department of Plant Pests and Diseases, Faculty of Agriculture, Universitas Brawijaya from May to September 2016. Apple leaves sampling was done diagonally, and taken from nine apple trees. Based on macroscopic and microscopic characteristics, 38 isolates were identified. In the old apple leaves, it obtained 17 isolates that consisted of 5 genera, mature leaves obtained 14 isolates consisted of 6 genera, and young leaves 7 isolates obtained consists of 2 genera. The mature leaves have highest abundance and diversity of endophytic fungi compared to young and old leaves. Endophytic fungi apple leaf dominated by Aspergillus. Mature and young leaves were different from old one based on Bray-Curtis similarity.","Afandhi, A; Choliq, FA; Anggrilika, WSH; Tarno, H",NA,NA,NA,"Afandhi, Aminudin; Choliq, Fery Abdul; Anggrilika, Havinda W.

"3","Presence","A study was conducted for isolation, identification and antibacterial potential of fungal endophytes of Adenocalymma alliaceum Miers., (Bignoniaceae), a medicinal shrub vine plant which has long history for its usages in curing various disorders. A total of 149 isolates of endophytic fungi representing 17 fungal taxa were obtained from 270 segments (90 from each stem, leaf and petiole) of this plant. Hyphomycetes (77.85%) were the most prevalent, followed by Ascomycetes (8.05%) and Coelomycetes (4.03%) respectively. A considerable amount of fungal isolates was kept under (10.07%) Mycelia-Sterilia (MS). Leaf harboured maximum colonization of endophytic fungi (72.22%) which was greater than stem (67.78%) and petiole (25.54%). The Jc similarity index was maximum (0.619) between stem vs leaf followed by leaf vs petiole (0.571) and stem vs petiole (0.428). The dominant endophytic fungi were Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus niger, Stenella agalis, Fusarium oxysporum, Curvularia lunata and Fusarium roseum. Among twelve endophytic fungi tested for antibacterial activity, crude extracts of nine endophytic fungi (75%), showed antibacterial potential against one or more clinical human pathogens. Alternaria alternata, Curvularia lunata, Penicillium sp. and Chaetomium globosum exhibited significant antibacterial activity against 4 of 5 tested pathogens, showing broad spectrum activity. This investigation explains the value of sampling from different tissues of a host plant for the greater species diversity, and additionally, the antibacterial screening of some endophytic fungi from this specific medicinal plant may represent a unique source for many of the useful antibacterial compounds.","Kharwar, RN; Verma, SK; Mishra, A; Gond, SK; Sharma, VK; Afreen, T; Kumar, A",NA,NA,NA,"Kharwar, Ravindra N.; Verma, Satish K.; Mishra, Ashish; Gond, Surendra K.; Sharma, Vijay K.; Afreen, Talat; Kumar, Anuj",NA,"Assessment of diversity, distribution and antibacterial activity of endophytic fungi isolated from a medicinal plant Adenocalymma alliaceum Miers","SYMBIOSIS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sharma, Vijay Kumar K/E-3541-2019; Gond, Surendra/ABB-6182-2021; Sharma, Vijay Kumar/J-5353-2019; Verma, Satish K./J-6398-2019","Sharma, Vijay Kumar K/0000-0002-2330-5830; Verma, Satish Kumar/0000-0003-4470-5398; Gond, Surendra/0000-0002-2737-9028; Afreen, Talat/0000-0003-3801-403X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0334-5114","1878-7665",NA,NA,NA,"AUG",2011,55,"1",NA,NA,NA,"39","46",NA,"10.1007/s13199-011-0142-2","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-011-0142-2",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000298499300005","View Full Record in Web of Science",3,NA
"4","Presence","The manner in which fungal endophytes activate host stress response systems is unknown; the occurrence of additional mechanisms involved in symbiotically-conferred stress tolerance in mangrove plants (the primary producers of estuarine food chain) is also an unresolved issue. Here, we report antioxidant potentials of four different mangroves and their endophytic fungi. We elucidated the possible roles of antioxidants in symbiotic association between mangroves and their endophytic fungi. Four different mangrove species and the predominant endophytic fungus Aspergillus flavus were analyzed using various in vitro assay systems (such as iron chelating capacity, reducing power, and hydroxyl radicals/hydrogen peroxide/1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging and inhibition of lipid peroxidation using the beta-carotene-linoleate model system). In vitro models clearly established the antioxidant potency of extracts of mangrove plants and their respective endophytic fungi, which aids in understanding the mutualistic associations of plant and endophyte against various biotic and abiotic stresses. Re-infection analysis of endophytic A. flavus in tobacco plants confirmed the endophytic status of the fungus and its enhancement effect on plant growth.","Ravindran, C; Naveenan, T; Varatharajan, GR; Rajasabapathy, R; Meena, RM",NA,NA,NA,"Ravindran, Chinnarajan; Naveenan, Thangaiah; Varatharajan, Govindaswamy R.; Rajasabapathy, Raju; Meena, Ram Murthi",NA,"Antioxidants in mangrove plants and endophytic fungal associations","BOTANICA MARINA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Rajasabapathy, Raju/HHN-6549-2022","Rajasabapathy, Raju/0000-0002-0304-870X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0006-8055","1437-4323",NA,NA,NA,"JUN",2012,55,"3",NA,NA,NA,"269","279",NA,"10.1515/bot-2011-0095","http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/bot-2011-0095",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000306458300008","View Full Record in Web of Science",4,NA

In this study, we classified 1160 fungal isolates from 29 medicinal plant species using traditional morphological methods. The colonization rate, isolation rate, and relative frequency of these endophytes were investigated. The relationship between the composition of endophytic fungi and the chemical constituents of host plants was also explored for the first time. The results showed that endophytic fungi from these medicinal plants exhibited high biodiversity, host-recurrence, tissue-specificity, and spatial heterogeneity. Taxa of,Alternaria, Colletotrichum, Phoma, Phomopsis, Xylariales, and mycelia sterilia were the dominant fungal endophytes. Some phenolic compounds were found to more likely coexist with certain endophytic fungi in the same plants.

"6","Review","The purpose of this systematic review was to identify the available literature of production, purification, and characterization of proteases by endophytic fungi. There are few complete studies that entirely exhibit the production, characterization, and purification of proteases from endophytic fungi. This study followed the PRISMA, and the search was conducted on five databases: PubMed, PMC, Science Direct, Scopus Articles, and Web of Science up until 18 May 2021, with no time or language restrictions. The methodology of the selected studies was evaluated using GRADE. Protease production, optimization, purification, and characterization were the main evaluated outcomes. Of the 5540 initially gathered studies, 15 met the inclusion criteria after a two-step selection process. Only two studies optimized the protease production using statistical design and two reported enzyme purification and characterization. The genus Penicillium and Aspergillus were the most cited among the eleven different genera of endophytic fungi evaluated in the selected articles. Six studies proved the ability of some endophytic fungi to produce fibrinolytic proteases, demonstrating that endophytic fungi can be exploited for the further production of agents used in thrombolytic therapy. However, further characterization and physicochemical studies are required to evaluate the real potential of endophytic fungi as sources of industrial enzymes.","Bezerra, VHS; Cardoso, SL; Fonseca-Bazzo, Y; Silveira, D; Magalhaes, PO; Souza, PM",NA,NA,NA,"Bezerra, Victor Hugo Souto; Cardoso, Samuel Leite; Fonseca-Bazzo, Yris; Silveira, Damaris; Magalhaes, Perola Oliveira; Souza, Paula Monteiro",NA,"Protease Produced by Endophytic Fungi: A Systematic Review","MOLECULES",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Silveira, Damaris/A-1942-2008; MAGALHÃES, PÉROLA/P-3378-2018; Souza, Paula/AAE-5731-2021","Silveira, Damaris/0000-0003-1851-5224; MAGALHÃES, PÉROLA/0000-0001-8011-6940; Souza, Paula/0000-0003-1824-2211; Fonseca, Yris/0000-0002-1230-3207",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1420-3049",NA,NA,NA,"NOV",2021,26,"22",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"7062","10.3390/molecules26227062","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules26227062",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,34834154,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000723631600001","View Full Record in Web of Science",6,NA

The endophytic fungi of medicinal plants are a treasure house of natural compounds. However, there is a lack of research on the diversity and biological activity of endophytic fungi of AOJ. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to study the diversity of endophytic fungi in the roots and stems of AOJ, and endophytic fungi with a high output of phenols and flavonoids were screened by chromogenic reaction, and the antioxidant and antibacterial activities and chemical constituents of crude extracts of their fermentation broth were studied. A total of 3,426 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to 9 phyla, 27 classes, 64 orders, 152 families, and 277 genera were identified from AOJ. There were significant differences in the endophytic fungal communities of AOJ roots and stems, as well as in the endophytic fungal communities of triangular AOJ and circular AOJ. In addition, 31 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated from AOJ, of which 6 strains had good antioxidant and antibacterial activities. The crude extract of YG-2 had the strongest free radical scavenging ability and bacteriostatic ability, and its IC50 (DPPH), IC50 (ABTS), and IC50.OH values were 0.009 +/- 0.000 mg/mL, 0.023 +/- 0.002 mg/mL, and 0.081 +/- 0.006 mg/mL, respectively. The results of LC-MS showed that the main component of the crude extract of YG-2 was caffeic acid (10.12 mu mol/g). Overall, the results of this study preliminarily elucidated the diversity and community composition of endophytic fungi of AOJ, indicating that AOJ endophytic fungi have abundant secondary metabolites and good antioxidant and antibacterial activities.

Fungal endophytes have the capacity to produce bioactive compounds and can independently synthesize secondary metabolites similar to those made by the host plants. Optimization of the fermentation culture is one of the most important strategies in increasing taxol production by endophytic fungi supplemented with several substances including carbon sources, nitrogen sources, precursors, inducer and the metabolic bypass inhibitors. Improved fermentation techniques and different biotechnological strategies such as gene cloning, gene transformation, mutations are widely being used on endophytic fungi in order to increase the productivity of the taxol.

"13","Review","Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that colonize plants during their entire, or a significant part of their life cycle without any symptoms, establishing a symbiosis association. They are abundant in plants and have been reported in various tissues, such as roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits. In recent years, research on the beneficial use of endophytic fungi has increased worldwide. These fungi have the ability to protect plants from both biotic and abiotic stresses through different mechanisms.

"14","Review","Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that exist almost ubiquitously inside the various tissues of living plants where they act as an important reservoir of diverse bioactive compounds. Recently, endophytic fungi have drawn tremendous attention from researchers; their isolation, culture, purification, and characterization have revealed the presence of around 200 important and diverse compounds including anticancer agents, antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, immunosuppressants, and antimycotics. Many of these anticancer compounds, such as paclitaxel, camptothecin, vinblastine, vincristine, podophyllotoxin, and their derivatives, are currently being used clinically for the treatment of various cancers (e.g., ovarian, breast, prostate, lung cancers, and leukemias). By increasing the yield of specific compounds with genetic engineering and other biotechnologies, endophytic fungi could be a promising, prolific source of anticancer drugs. In the future, compounds derived from endophytic fungi could increase treatment availability and cost effectiveness. This comprehensive review includes the putative anticancer compounds from plant-derived endophytic fungi discovered from 1990 to 2020 with their source endophytic fungi and host plants as well as their antitumor activity against various cell lines.","Hridoy, M; Gorapi, MZH; Noor, S; Chowdhury, NS; Rahman, MM; Muscari, I; Masia, F; Adorisio, S; Delfino, DV; Mazid, MA",NA,NA,NA,"Hridoy, Md.; Gorapi, Md.

"19","Review","Endophytic fungi are a highly diverse group of fungi that intermittently colonize all plants without causing symptoms of the disease. They sense and respond to physiological and environmental changes of their host plant and microbiome. The inter-organism interactions are largely driven by chemical networks mediated by specialized metabolites. The balance of these complex interactions leads to healthy and strong host plants. Endophytic strains have particular machinery to produce a plethora of secondary metabolites with a variety of bioactivities and unknown functions in an ecological niche. Terpenoids play a key role in endophytism and represent an important source of bioactive molecules for human health and agriculture. In this review, we describe the role of endophytic fungi in plant health, fungal terpenoids in multiple interactions, and bioactive fungal terpenoids recently reported from endophytes, mainly from plants used in traditional medicine, as well as from algae and mangroves. Additionally, we highlight endophytic fungi as producers of important chemotherapeutic terpenoids, initially discovered in plants. Despite advances in understanding endophytism, we still have much to learn in this field. The study of the role, the evolution of interactions of endophytic fungi and their terpenoids provide an opportunity for better applications in human health and agriculture.","Galindo-Solis, JM; Fernandez, FJ",NA,NA,NA,"Galindo-Solis, Juan M.; Fernandez, Francisco J.",NA,"Endophytic Fungal Terpenoids: Natural Role and Bioactivities","MICROORGANISMS",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Fernandez, Francisco/L-3320-2015; GALINDO SOLIS, J.

Tetrastigma hemsleyanum is a traditional Chinese herb plant. The endophytic fungus strain TH15 isolated from root of T. hemsleyanum has been reported to significantly promote the growth of T. hemsleyanum. In this study, we combined HPLC-MS and ELISA to analyze the composition of TH15's fermentation broth. We also explored the effects of zearalenone, a metabolite of strain TH15, on the growth of T. hemsleyanum seedlings and expansin gene expression in root. Metabolomic analysis revealed that TH15 metabolites contained 5 phytohormones [indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), methyl indole-3-acetate (MeIAA), jasmonic acid (JA), jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine (JA-ILE) and salicylic acid (SA)], amino acids, sugar and vitamins. ELISA test indicated that TH15 metabolites contained zearalenone (ZEN). Supplement 0.1-0.5 mg/L ZEN into the culture medium promoted the growth of seedlings of T. hemsleyanum. Besides, ZEN treatment significantly promoted expression of the expansin gene in the root of T. hemsleyanum. The endophytic fungus strain TH15 secretes phytohormones like IAA, JA and SA, as well as other metabolites like ZEN. TH15's growth-promoting effects are realized by these secreted molecules' coordinated action.

Plant and endophytic fungi are considered a source of a plethora of bioactive compounds with potential applications in the agriculture, pharmaceutical and food industry. Endophytic fungi are ubiquitous microorganisms living asymptomatically within the tissue of higher plants without causing any adverse effects or visible symptoms. In this scenario, fungal endophytic bioactive compounds have an important function to endorse plant growth through diverse mechanisms.

"32","Presence","Background: Symbiotic interactions with fungal endophytes are argued to be responsible for the tolerance of plants to some stresses and for their adaptation to natural conditions. Aims: In this study we aimed to examine the endophytic fungal diversity associated with roots of date palms growing in coastal dune systems, and to screen this collection of endophytes for potential use as biocontrol agents, for antagonistic activity and mycoparasitism, and as producers of antifungal compounds with potential efficacy against root diseases of date palm. Methods: Roots of nine individual date palms growing in three coastal locations in the South-East of Spain (Guardamar, El Carabassl, and San Juan) were selected to isolate endophytic fungi. Isolates were identified on the basis of morphological and/or molecular characters. Results: Five hundred and fifty two endophytic fungi were isolated and assigned to thirty morphological taxa or molecular operational taxonomic units. Most isolates belonged to Ascomycota, and the dominant order was Hypocreales. Fusarium and Clonostachys were the most frequently isolated genera and were present at all sampling sites. Comparisons of the endophytic diversity with previous studies, and their importance in the management of the date palm crops are discussed. Conclusions: This is the first study on the diversity of endophytic fungi-associated with roots of date palm. The isolates obtained might constitute a source of biological control agents and biofertilizers for use in crops of this plant. (C) 2016 Asociacion Espafiola de Micologia.

The plant selectively allows microbial colonization to carve endophyte structures through phenotypic genes and metabolic signals. Correspondingly, fungi develop various adaptations through symbiotic signal transduction to thrive in mycorrhiza. Over the past decade, the regulatory mechanism of plant-endophyte interaction has been uncovered. Currently, great progress has been made on plant endosphere, especially in endophytic fungi. Here, we systematically summarize the current understanding of endophytic fungi colonization, molecular recognition signal pathways, and immune evasion mechanisms to clarify the transboundary communication that allows endophytic fungi colonization and homeostatic phytobiome.

"36","Presence","The potential of endophytes to initiate changes in host secondary metabolism is expected to be applied to improve the biochemical qualities of the crop. Our previous study revealed the significant impacts of fungal endophytes on the biochemical properties and the anthocyanin profiles in grape berries of the local cultivar 'Rose Honey' (RH). To validate the effects, our present work further assessed the impacts of the same fungal endophytes on grape berries of the worldwide planted grapevine cultivar 'Cabernet Sauvignon' (CS). Consistent with the results of RH, exposure to most of the used endophytic fungi shaped the biochemical traits and anthocyanidin profile of the CS grape berries. Among the detected biochemical traits, the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) activity in berries had the strongest response to endophytic fungal exposure, and the fungal strains RH32, RH36, and MDR1 had the greatest biochemical impacts on the grape berries. Interestingly, the most anthocyanidin species were detected in the two grape berry varieties when exposed to fungal strains MDR36 and RH34. In both varieties, the total anthocyanin concentrations were quantitatively promoted by strains RH36, RH44, MDR1, and MDR36, but suppressed by strain RH7. Malvidin derivatives and delphinidin derivatives accounted for the majority of the relative abundance of the total detected anthocyanins in CS berries. The acylation degree of anthocyanins in grape berries was also significantly promoted by exposure to fungal endophytes. In CS grape berries, a seldom-distributed anthocyanidin, pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside, as well as the diglucoside anthocyanidin were detected when exposed to fungal strains as RH32, RH34, RH36, MDR1, MDR4, and MDR36. Overall, the endophytic fungal strains MDR36, RH36, and RH34 have the ability to promote metabolite profiles in both grape varieties.

Studies on endophytic fungi have been conducted in Korea for over 30 years. This paper summarizes the published results of those studies. The endophytic fungi of approximately 132 plant species in Korea have been studied since the 1990s, resulting in over 118 publications. The host plants featured in these studies comprised 3 species of mosses, 34 species of woody plants, and 95 species of herbaceous plants. At the family level, the most studied plants were members of the Poaceae family, covering 18 species. Regionally, these studies were conducted throughout Korea, but over half of the studies were conducted in Gyeongsangbuk-do, Gangwon-do, and Chungcheongnam-do.

"39","Presence","Ethylene, the first known gaseous phytohormone, is involved in plant growth, development as well as responses to environmental signals. However, limited information is available on the role of ethylene in endophytic fungi induced secondary metabolites biosynthesis. Atractylodes lancea is a traditional Chinese herb, and its quality depends on the main active compounds sesquiterpenoids. This work showed that the endophytic fungus Gilmaniella sp. AL12 induced ethylene production in Atractylodes lancea. Pre-treatment of plantlets with ethylene inhibiter aminooxyacetic acid (AOA) suppressed endophytic fungi induced accumulation of ethylene and sesquiterpenoids. Plantlets were further treated with AOA, salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol (PAC), jasmonic acid inhibitor ibuprofen (IBU), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenger catalase (CAT), nitric oxide (NO) -specific scavenger 2-(4-Carboxypheny1)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxy1-3-oxide potassium salt (cPTIO). With endophytic fungi inoculation, IBU or PAC did not inhibit ethylene production, and JA and SA generation were suppressed by AOA, showing that ethylene may act as an upstream signal of JA and SA pathway. With endophytic fungi inoculation, CAT or cPTIO suppressed ethylene production, and H2O2 or NO generation was not affected by 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), showing that ethylene may act as a downstream signal of H2O2 and NO pathway. Then, plantlets were treated with ethylene donor ACC, JA, SA, H2O2, NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP).

In the present study, three types of mangrove plants, namely Kandelia candel, Rhizophora stylosa and Rhizophoraceae from Zhanjiang region including the leaves, roots and stems were collected, and endophytic fungi were isolated, purified and identified from these mangrove plants. MTT assay was used to observe the effects of the isolated endophytic fungi on the growth of A549 and NCI-H460 lung cancer cells. The effect of the endophytic fungi on lung cancer angiogenesis in vitro induced by the HPV-16 E7 oncoprotein was observed. Our results showed that 28 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated, purified and identified from the three types of mangrove plants. Ten strains of endophytic fungi significantly suppressed the growth of A549 and NCI-H460 cells.

We found that 48 of the 49 tested endophytic fungal isolates have significant potential saprotrophic capacity. Contrary to expectation, the amount of solar radiation available to the leaf from which the fungi were isolated had no significant impact on potential sap-rotrophic capacity and there was more variability in potential saprotrophic capacity among isolates within a genus than among genera.

"42","Presence","Endophytic fungi are a group of fungi that reside in the living plant without causing any disease symptoms. It shows symbiotic/mutualistic characteristics with host plants. Endophytic fungi may increase the host defense system against various pathogenic microorganisms and may encompass secondary metabolites of respective host plants. Isolation of endophytic fungi and its metabolites from Justicia gendarussa plant grown in Bangladesh is a recent and new approach. A total of seven endophytic fungi were isolated and purified from the leaf and bark part of the plant. All of the isolated endophytic fungi were identified up to genus level on the basis of macroscopic and microscopic characteristics and up to species level on the basis of molecular characteristics as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Diaporthe pseudomangiferae, Pseudopestalotiopsis camelliae-sinensis, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Fusarium solani, Colletotrichum tropicale and Colletotrichum siamense. Preliminary chemical screening of the fungal extracts by thin-layer chromatographic technique revealed the presence of various compounds such as flavonoids, anthraquinones, couramins, isocoumarins etc. Fungal strain Pseudopestalotiopsis camelliae-sinensis exhibited significant antiradical activity through DPPH scavenging method and moderate antimicrobial activity against a wide range of human pathogenic microbes. Using brine shrimp lethality bioassay, all the isolates showed strong cytotoxic activity, therefore suggested that all the extracts may have bioactive metabolites. Overall, these findings indicate that Justicia gendarussa and its associated endophytic fungi could be an important source for exploring potentially bioactive compounds or leads for the new drug candidates.

They are potential agents for the production of new and bioactive compounds, as well as for the use in agriculture, medicine and industry. Endophytic fungi produce Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), which are low molecular weight compounds that readily evaporate at normal temperatures and pressures. Fungi are not only capable of producing a wide variety of volatile compounds, they are also able to metabolize them and they have a great importance in chemical ecology. Mixtures of VOCs produced by endophytic fungi are mainly composed by alcohols, aldehydes, esters, aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, terpenoids, nitrogen and sulfur compounds. They can be used in biotechnological applications such as biofuels, mycofumigation, alellochemicals, flavor in food and in the chemotaxonomic identification of fungi.

While endophytic fungi often form mutualisitc associations to the benefit of the plant, plant-parasitic nematodes can cause detrimental yield losses. Although both groups of organisms interact very closely within the plant tissue, the potential role of endophytic fungi in nematode control was long overseen. Only recently has research on the interrelationships between endophytic fungi and plant-parasitic nematodes gained the interest of science working in plant protection. Numerous non-pathogenic endophytic fungi have been iisolated from agronomic crops such as tomato and banana and have shown antagonistic potential towards a diverse spectrum of plant-parasitic nematodes. This chapter reviews the research that has been conducted on the use of endophytic fungi to control plant-parasitic nematodes. The chapter concentrates on several important groups of mutualistic endophytic fungi, in particular the endomy-corrhizal fungi, Piriformospora indica, grass endophytes and Fusarium endophytes. Their biological control potential is presented and possible mode-of-actions are discussed. The review is meant to further stimulate research in this fascinating area and to provide a road map for practical application of endophytic fungi for the integrated management of plant-parasitic nematodes in the near future.","Hallmann, J; Sikora, RA",NA,"Davies, K; Spiegel, Y",NA,"Hallmann, Johannes; Sikora, Richard A.",NA,"Endophytic Fungi","BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OF PLANT-PARASITIC NEMATODES: BUILDING COHERENCE BETWEEN MICROBIAL ECOLOGY AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS","Progress in Biological Control",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1573-5915",NA,"978-1-4020-9647-1",NA,NA,NA,2011,11,NA,NA,NA,NA,"227","258",NA,"10.1007/978-1-4020-9648-8_10","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4020-9648-8_10","10.1007/978-1-4020-9648-8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000293759700010","View Full Record in Web of Science",45,NA

Methodology : Eight isolates belonging to three endophytic fungi viz. Coiletotrichum faicatum, Fusarium moniliforme and Trichoderma viride isolated from sugarcane plant were used for differentiation using PCR-RFLP pattern of rDNA. For this, the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of rDNA was amplified with the help of universal primers and the PCR products were digested with various restriction enzymes. Results : The size variation of amplified products ranged from 637 bp (C. falcaturn isolates), 592-614 bp (F. moniliforme isolates) to 631-698 bp (T.viride isolates). Five restriction enzymes viz. Alu I, EcoR I, Barn H I, MSe land Smal used for PCR-RFLP of ITS fragments yielded a total of 54 bands that were arranged in three RFLP patterns.

The culture filtrates of endophytic fungi were applied to pot and field experiments using soybean as host plants. In vitro study of these endophytic fungal culture filtrates showed strong nematocidal activity by killing juveniles of M. javanica to a certain degree, while Chaetomium sp., and Talaromyces assiutensis showed 100% mortality rate after 48 h.

"49","Review","Background Scientific approaches into modern agricultural systems, as opposed to the use of synthetic pesticides in food production, became important by exploring endophytic fungi capable of protecting plants against pathogens for maximum crop productivity. Main body Diverse endophytic microbes colonizing the internal tissue of plants exhibit beneficial and pathological effects on plants. The beneficial endophytic fungi assisted plants in the control of pathogenic endophytic fungi in plants due to their ability to directly or indirectly promote plant health. Inefficient agricultural practices and environmental factors contribute to the disease emergence in plants. Endophytic fungi employed diverse mechanisms in phytopathogen control by activating and inducing plant resistance through gene expression, synthesis of fungi-derived metabolite compounds, and hormonal signaling molecules. The mutual coexistence between endophytic fungi and host plants remains an important mechanism in disease suppression. An in-depth understanding and selection of beneficial endophytic fungi and interaction between pathogens and host plants are important in managing challenges associated with the endophyte biocontrol mechanisms. Conclusion Research findings on the use of endophytic fungi as bioinoculants are advancing, and understanding endophytic fungi antibiosis action through the synthesis of biocontrol agents (BCAs) can, however, be explored in integrated plant disease management. Therefore, in this review, the biocontrol mechanism of endophytic fungi against plant pathogens was highlighted.","Adeleke, BS; Ayilara, MS; Akinola, SA; Babalola, OO",NA,NA,NA,"Adeleke, Bartholomew Saanu; Ayilara, Modupe Stella; Akinola, Saheed Adekunle; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti",NA,"Biocontrol mechanisms of endophytic fungi","EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Ayilara, Modupe Stella/GVR-8764-2022; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti/Y-7564-2019; Adeleke, Bartholomew/ACQ-1241-2022; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti/HJI-7611-2023","Ayilara, Modupe Stella/0000-0002-8298-1935; Babalola, Olubukola Oluranti/0000-0003-4344-1909; Adeleke, Bartholomew/0000-0001-7707-8816; Akinola, Saheed/0000-0002-6520-8609",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1110-1768","2536-9342",NA,NA,NA,"45406",2022,32,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"46","10.1186/s41938-022-00547-1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41938-022-00547-1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000786450100002","View Full Record in Web of Science",49,NA
"50","Review","Endophytic fungi are capable of producing plant associated metabolites and their analogs with therapeutic value. In order to identify the potential endophytic isolates producing bioactive compounds, one need to screen all isolated endophytes, which may run into hundreds. Isolation of endophytic fungi is relatively a simple process; but screening of the isolated fungi for required metabolite production is a cumbersome process. Endophytic fungi producing plant associated metabolites may contain genes involved in the entire biosynthetic pathway(s). Therefore, ascertaining the presence of key enzymes of a particular biosynthetic pathway could serve as a molecular marker for screening of these endophytes to produce that metabolite. In absence of entire biosynthetic pathways in endophytic fungi, plant genes associated with that metabolic pathway could serve as markers. This review focuses on the impact of molecular approaches to screen the endophytic fungi for the production of bioactive compounds. An attempt has been made on screening of anticancer compounds like taxol (paclitaxel), podophyllotoxin, and camptothecin using molecular markers. The advantages of molecular approaches over conventional methods to screen endophytic fungi and also identification of endophytic fungi are discussed.","Vasundhara, M; Kumar, A; Reddy, MS",NA,NA,NA,"Vasundhara, M.; Kumar, Anil; Reddy, M.

"52","Review","Increased understanding of the interactions between endophytic fungi and plants has led to the discovery of a new generation of chemical compounds and processes between endophytic fungi and plants. Due to the long-term co-evolution between fungal endophytes and host plants, endophytes have evolved special biotransformation abilities, which can have critical consequences on plant metabolic processes and their composition. Biotransformation or bioconversion can impact the synthesis and decomposition of hormones, sugars, amino acids, vitamins, lipids, proteins, and various secondary metabolites, including flavonoids, polysaccharides, and terpenes. Endophytic fungi produce enzymes and various bioactive secondary metabolites with industrial value and can degrade or sequester inorganic and organic small molecules and macromolecules (e.g., toxins, pollutants, heavy metals). These fungi also have the ability to cause highly selective catalytic conversion of high-value compounds in an environmentally friendly manner, which can be important for the production/innovation of bioactive molecules, food and nutrition, agriculture, and environment. This work mainly summarized recent research progress in this field, providing a reference for further research and application of fungal endophytes.

We isolated 10 endophytic fungal strains from V. minor. An extract from one (Vm-J2), showed positive reactions with both Dragendorff's and Mayer's reagents. The strain had a component with the same TLC R-f value and HPLC retention time as authentic vincamine. Therefore, the fungus appeared to produce the same bioactive ingredient, vincamine, as the host plant.

Endophytic fungal communities were grouped into 40 and 43 anamorphic ascomycetes (21 and 23 genera) and 20 teleomorphic ascomycetes (6 and 7 genera) in D. bicornis and P. flavidum, respectively. PDA supported the expression of larger number of fungal communities than MEA and MB; and P. flavidum hosted more number of endophytic fungi than D. bicornis. Seasons played an important role in supporting the assemblage of fungal endophytes. Endophytic fungal species richness and assemblages in plant regions were determined for alpha, beta, and gamma diversities. The ethyl acetate followed by methanolic extracts of certain fungal species showed good antagonistic and antibacterial activities. Among fungal endophytes, Curvularia protuberata and Penicillium citrinum exhibited high antagonistic and antibacterial activities.

"63","Review","Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that colonize living plants' tissues without causing any harm. They are known as a natural source of bioactive metabolites with diverse pharmacological functions. Many structurally different chemical metabolites were isolated from endophytic fungi. Recently, the increasing trends in human health problems and diseases have escalated the search for bioactive metabolites from endophytic fungi. The conventional bioassay-guided study is known as laborious due to chemical complexity. Thus, metabolomics studies have attracted extensive research interest owing to their potential in dealing with a vast number of metabolites.

This study reports the occurrence, diversity, and secondary metabolite profiles of endophytic fungi isolated from Salvia abrotanoides plants obtained from three geographically distinct sites in Iran. A total of 56 endophytic fungi were isolated from roots and leaves of S. abrotanoides; site-specificity and root-dominated colonization was found to be a general characteristic of the endophytes. Based on molecular identification, the endophytic fungi were classified into 15 genera. Mycelial extracts of these isolates were subjected to high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses and revealed a broad spectrum of secondary metabolites. Our results demonstrated that Penicillium canescens, P. murcianum, Paraphoma radicina, and Coniolariella hispanica are producers of cryptotanshinone, which is a main bioactive compound of S. abrotanoides. Moreover, it was shown that it can be produced independent of the host plant. The effect of exogenous gibberellin on S. abrotanoides and endophytic fungi was shown to have a positive effect on increasing the cryptotanshinone production in the plant as well as in endophytic fungi cultivated under axenic conditions. Our findings provide further evidence that endophytic fungi play an important role in the production plant bioactive metabolites. Moreover, they provide an exploitable basis to increase cryptotanshinone production in S. abrotanoides.","Teimoori-Boghsani, Y; Ganjeali, A; Cernava, T; Müller, H; Asili, J; Berg, G",NA,NA,NA,"Teimoori-Boghsani, Yeganeh; Ganjeali, Ali; Cernava, Tomislav; Mueller, Henry; Asili, Javad; Berg, Gabriele",NA,"Endophytic Fungi of Native Salvia abrotanoides Plants Reveal High Taxonomic Diversity and Unique Profiles of Secondary Metabolites","FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Berg, Gabriele/ACJ-8718-2022; Müller, Henry/HNQ-9616-2023; Cernava, Tomislav/S-6277-2019; Asili, Javad/AAF-3587-2019","Berg, Gabriele/0000-0001-9423-3101; Cernava, Tomislav/0000-0001-7772-4080; Asili, Javad/0000-0002-4635-474X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1664-302X",NA,NA,NA,NA,"45308",2020,10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"3013","10.3389/fmicb.2019.03013","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2019.03013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,32010087,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000510721900001","View Full Record in Web of Science",64,NA
"65","Presence","Aims: Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that live asymptomatically within plant tissues, producing a wide range of metabolites, including compounds potentially useful for drug development. We investigated endophytic fungi from Maliau Basin, Sabah to identify strains producing bioactive compounds, notably with antimicrobial activity. Methodology and results: A total of 23 plants were sampled yielding 345 endophytic fungal isolates. Of these, 44 isolates were screened for antimicrobial activity against nine species of bacteria and fungi, revealing 14 endophytes producing bioactive metabolites. Crude fungal extracts were obtained from broth cultures of endophytic isolates with promising activity while the fungal strains were identified using molecular methods. The crude extract of endophyte MB4 WA10, isolated from Callophyllum sp. (bintangor) showed IC50 of 2.6 mg/mL against S. aureus and 0.6 mg/mL against B. subtilis while the extract of MB22 WA16, an isolate identified as Valsaceae sp., was also active against S. aureus with an IC50 of 1.37 mg/mL. Another isolate, namely MB5 L4 (WA), was identified as a Phomopsis sp. and its extract was the most active against S. aureus with an IC50 of 1 mg/mL. The HPLC fraction of this fungal extract with the highest inhibition (92.37%) of S. aureus was purified for compound isolation and identification. A polyketide compound, 2,3-dihydro-2-hydroxy-2,4-dimethyl-5-trans-propenylfuran-3-one (C9H12O3), with molecular weight of 168.192 was identified based on mass spectral and NMR data analysis.

HupA is a potent, reversible, highly specific, centrally active and selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, and is commonly used to improve Alzheimer's disease.At present, H. serrata resources have been overexploited and their artificial cultivation has lagged behind the need, so the market demand cannot be met. In this study, the diversity of the endophytic fungi in H. serrata was studied by high-throughput sequencing and traditional culture methods. Furthermore, the ability of the isolated endophytic fungi to produce acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting activity was evaluated. The results related to the diversity of fungi between high-throughput sequencing and traditional culture methods were compared. With high-throughput sequencing, five phyla, 22 classes, 55 orders, 120 families, and 178 genera of fungi were detected in Hubei Province, and five phyla, 22 classes, 54 orders, 124 families, and 196 genera were detected in Fujian Province. After cultivation with traditional culture methods, two phyla, three classes, five orders, six families, and six genera were detected in Hubei, and one phylum, three classes, five orders, five families, and six genera in Fujian. The endophytic fungi of H. serrata are highly diverse, and the results of high-throughput sequencing comprehensively reflect their community compositions. When the acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting activity of the isolated and cultured endophytic fungi was determined, five and three endophytic fungi from Hubei and Fujian Provinces, respectively, had good inhibitory activity (inhibition rate > 50%). Most of them were separated from leaf tissue. The strain HBR-1 and strain FJL-5 had the strongest inhibitory effects on AChE, with inhibition rates of 72.34% and 60.54%, respectively. Although only a proportion of the endophytic fungi was isolated with traditional culture methods, metabolites with broad potential applications can be isolated from these fungal cultures. The combination of high-throughput sequencing and traditional culture methods can be used to isolate and purify endophytic fungi in a targeted manner, gain many endophytic fungi, and enrich the endophytic fungi resource library.","Lu, ZY; Ma, YS; Xiao, LT; Yang, HL; Zhu, D",NA,NA,NA,"Lu, Ziyun; Ma, Yangshuai; Xiao, Liting; Yang, Huilin; Zhu, Du",NA,"Diversity of Endophytic Fungi in Huperzia serrata and Their Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitory Activity","SUSTAINABILITY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2071-1050",NA,NA,NA,"NOV",2021,13,"21",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"12073","10.3390/su132112073","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132112073",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000718619800001","View Full Record in Web of Science",67,NA

"76","Presence","Catharanthus roseus (L.) is well known for its production of several anticancerous vinca alkaloids such as vincristine, vindesine, vinorelbine, vinblastin, and the recently discovered vinflunine. This plant is a host to a plethora of endophytic fungi. A total 183 endophytic fungi representing 13 fungal taxa were isolated from leaf, stem and root tissues of C roseus from two sites representing two different ecosystems in North India. Interestingly, with two exceptions (one coelomycete and one ascomycete), all of the isolates were Hyphomycetes. Root tissues were heavily colonized by genera such as Alternaria, Cladosporium and Aspergillus. However, leaf tissues showed a greater diversity of endophytes and Drechslera, Curvularia, Bipolaris, Alternaria and Aspergillus spp. were the dominant fungi isolated. Interestingly, a fungus producing no fruiting structures was the most prevalent, isolated from C roseus. On the basis of its partial ITS-5.8 S rDNA sequences, it was identified as Chaetomium globossum, with 99% sequence similarity (537/540). The species richness as well as frequency of colonization of endophytic fungi were pronounced in the root tissues at both sites (Loc 1, 38.6%; Loc 2, 33.7%). This study suggests that endophytes are both host- and tissue-specific. It also confirms that despite ecological variations, there were little differences in the species richness of fungal endo. phytes recovered from plants in the two different ecological sites.","Kharwar, RN; Verma, VC; Strobel, G; Ezra, D",NA,NA,NA,"Kharwar, Ravindra N.; Verma, Vijay C.; Strobel, Gary; Ezra, David",NA,"The endophytic fungal complex of Catharanthus roseus (L.)

In total 4345 fungal nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region sequences (rDNA ITS) obtained from all sugar beet grown in two locations (Shihezi and Changji) on the north slope of Tianshan Mountain, China. The most abundant fungal groups in all sugar beet were Basidiomycota (97.26%). The other dominant phyla were from Ascomycota (0.61%) and Glomeromycota (2.13%). There was a marked difference in diversity of endophytic fungi in sugar beet for different growth stages. The greatest number of Operational T-RFLP Units was detected during sucrose accumulation (84) and tuber growth (74). Endophytic fungal diversity was reduced during seedling growth (18 OTUs) and rosette formation (58 OTUs). One OTU was common to all four periods of growth. There were more OTUs in Shihezi than in Changji. The dynamics of endophytic fungal communities were influenced by plant genotype and plant growth stage. Results indicated that the three factors were significantly related (alpha = 0.05) to the distribution of endophytic fungi, with host species the most important, followed by sampling dates and sampling locations.

"82","Presence","Background Plants maintain the steady-state balance of the mutually beneficial symbiosis relationship with their endophytic fungi through secondary metabolites. Meanwhile endophytic fungi can serve as biological inducers to promote the biosynthesis and accumulation of valuable secondary metabolites in host plants through a variety of ways. The composition and structure of endophytic fungal community are affected by many factors, including tissues, seasons and so on. In this work, we studied the community diversity, temporal and spatial pattern of endophytic fungi detected from the roots, stems and leaves of Huperzia serrata in different seasons. The correlation between endophytic fungi and huperzine A (HupA) content in plants was analyzed. Results A total of 7005 operational taxonomic units were detected, and all strains were identified as 14 phyla, 54 classes, 140 orders, 351 families and 742 genera. Alpha diversity analysis showed that the diversity of endophytic fungi in stem and leaf was higher than that in root, and the diversity in summer (August) was lower than that in other months. NMDS analysis showed that the endophytic fungal communities of leaves, stems and roots were significantly different, and the root and leaf communities were also different between four seasons. Through correlation analysis, it was found that 33 genera of the endophytic fungi of H. serrata showed a significant positive correlation with the content of HupA (p < 0.05), of which 13 genera (Strelitziana, Devriesia, Articulospora, Derxomyces, Cyphellophora, Trechispora, Kurtzmanomyces, Capnobotryella, Erythrobasidium, Camptophora, Stagonospora, Lachnum, Golubevia) showed a highly significant positive correlation with the content of HupA (p < 0.01). These endophytic fungi may have the potential to promote the biosynthesis and accumulation of HupA in plant. Conclusions This report is the first time to analyze the diversity of endophytic fungi in tissues of H. serrata in different seasons, which proves that there is variability in different tissues and seasonal distribution patterns.

Methods and results Plants were collected from northeast-Iran and endophytic fungi were isolated and identified using partial large subunit nrDNA, internal transcribed spacer, translation elongation factor, and beta-tubulin genetic markers. Endophytic fungi that improved seed germination were studied under greenhouse conditions. Ninety-seven endophytic fungi were identified. Preussia africana, Bjerkandera adusta, Schizophyllum commune, Alternaria embellisia, Trichaptum biforme, Septoria malagutii, A. consortiale, Verticillium dahliae, Fusarium avenacearum, and Trametes versicolor significantly improved seed-germination. Alternaria consortiale produced the highest level of indole-3-acetic acid-like compounds and maize growth-promoting. Conclusions Plant fungal colonization frequency increased with orthometric height. Sampling location Chahar Bagh at 2230 m contained the most endophytic fungi. Fusarium and Alternaria were the most frequently isolated endophytic genera. Therefore, medicinal plants are potential hosts for endophytic fungi that may be suitable biofertilizer agents in agriculture.

Screening of 94 endophytic fungal isolates obtained from plant H. serrata was carried out for the production of HupA. Their morphological characteristics were studied and rDNA sequence analysis was carried out. The cultures were grown in liquid culture medium and the extracted metabolites were analyzed by thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatograph for the presence of HupA.

"87","Review","NOVELTY STATEMENTPhytoremediation is an effective method for ecological remediation of heavy metal contaminated soil. Endophytic fungi such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, dark septate endophytic fungi, plant growth promoting endophytic fungi can synergistically improve the adaptability to heavy metal stress. This review comprehensively summarizes the regulation mechanism of plant response to heavy metal stress mediated by endophytic fungi for the first time, and provides new insights and proposals for exploring novel hyperaccumulator for phytoremediation more effectively. Endophytic fungi exist widely in plants and play an important role in the growth and adaptation of plants. They could be used in phytoremediation techniques against heavy metal contaminated soil since beneficial microbial symbionts can endow plants with resistance to external heavy metal stresses. This review summarized the regulation mechanism of plant response to heavy metal stress mediated by endophytic fungi. Potential endophytic fungi in enhancing plant's adaption to heavy metal stresses include arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, dark septate endophytic fungi, plant growth promoting endophytic fungi. The mechanisms involve coevolution strategy, immune regulation and detoxification transport to improve the ability of plants to adapt to heavy metal stress. They can increase the synthesis of host hormones and maintaining the balance of endogenous hormones, strengthen osmotic regulation, regulate carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and increase immune activity, antioxidant enzyme and glutathione activity. They also help to improve the detoxification transport and heavy metal emission capacity of the host by significantly producing iron carrier, metallothionein and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase. The combination of endophytic fungi and hyperaccumulation plants provides a promising technology for the ecological restoration of heavy metal contaminated soil. Endophytic fungi reserves further development on enhancing host plant's adaptability to heavy metal stresses.","Zheng, JD; Xie, XG; Li, CY; Wang, HX; Yu, YR; Huang, BK",NA,NA,NA,"Zheng, Jiadong; Xie, Xingguang; Li, Chunyan; Wang, Hongxia; Yu, Yaru; Huang, Baokang",NA,"Regulation mechanism of plant response to heavy metal stress mediated by endophytic fungi","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHYTOREMEDIATION",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Yu, Yaru/AAU-3372-2020",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1522-6514","1549-7879",NA,NA,NA,"45580",2023,25,"12",NA,NA,NA,"1596","1613",NA,"10.1080/15226514.2023.2176466","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2023.2176466",NA,"2/23/2024",NA,NA,NA,NA,36786203,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000932241100001","View Full Record in Web of Science",87,NA

A total of 418 articles were found using the following sets of keywords: Endophytic, fungi, and Cerrado; endophytic, fungi, rupestrian, and grass lands; endophytic, fungi, Brazilian, and savanna; among these, 14 articles were selected. The articles were grouped into studies on the biodiversity of Cerrado endophytic fungi, chemical studies, and other subjects. All the articles were found to be related to the diversity present in the Cerrado of the southeastern and midwestern regions, they show high fungal biodiversity with Diaporthe genus predominant in almost all plants studied. In all the studies on the chemical diversity of endophytic fungi, new compounds or new natural products were found associated with a range of bioactivity, especially antifungal. It shows the great potential of endophytes in the production of new and bioactive secondary metabolites, as well as the unexplored chemical diversity of endophytes isolated from endemic plant species.

"89","Presence","Diverse endophytic fungi exist within plant aerial tissues, with a global estimate of up to a million undescribed species. These endophytes constitute a rich bio-resource for exploration to discover new natural products. Here we investigate fungal endophytes associated with a medicinal plant, Nerium oleander L. (Apocynaceae). A total of 42 endophytic fungal strains were isolated from the host plant. Total antioxidant capacity, xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity, antimicrobial activity, and total phenolic content (TPC) were evaluated for 16 representative fungal cultures grown in improved Czapek's broth and for the host plant. The total antioxidant capacities and phenolic contents of the fungal cultures ranged from 9.59 to 150.79 mu mol trolox/100 mL culture, and from 0.52 to 13.95 mg gallic acid/100 mL culture, respectively. The fungal culture of an endophytic strain Chaetomium sp. showed the strongest antioxidant capacity, contained the highest level of phenolics, and to some extent inhibited xanthine oxidase activity with an IC50 value of 109.8 mu g/ mL. A significant positive correlation was found between antioxidant capacity and TPC in the tested samples. Most of the endophytic fungal cultures tested have a wide range of antimicrobial activities, which were not very strong, but much better than those of the host plant. The major bioactive constituents of the fungal cultures were investigated using LC-ESI-MS and GC-MS, and preliminary identification detected phenolics (e.g. phenolic acids and their derivatives, flavonoids) and volatile and aliphatic compounds. This study shows that the endophytic fungi isolated from N. oleander can be a potential antioxidant resource.","Huang, WY; Cai, YZ; Hyde, KD; Corke, H; Sun, M",NA,NA,NA,"Huang, Wu-Yang; Cai, Yi-Zhong; Hyde, Kevin D.; Corke, Harold; Sun, Mei",NA,"Endophytic fungi from Nerium oleander L (Apocynaceae):: main constituents and antioxidant activity","WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Corke, Harold/D-3068-2009; Hyde, Kevin D/F-7890-2010; Cai, Yi-Zhong/B-9774-2009; HUANG, Wuyang/ABH-5066-2020; Sun, Mei/D-3124-2009","Corke, Harold/0000-0001-7709-0129; HUANG, Wuyang/0000-0002-3038-0636;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0959-3993","1573-0972",NA,NA,NA,"SEP",2007,23,"9",NA,NA,NA,"1253","1263",NA,"10.1007/s11274-007-9357-z","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11274-007-9357-z",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000249057700009","View Full Record in Web of Science",89,NA

"91","Review","Endophytic fungi reside within the plant tissues and maintain a strong symbiotic relationship. They are of utmost importance as promising sources of chemically diverse bioactive natural products. These microbes alter gene expression levels, modulate biosynthetic pathways, mitigate stressful conditions in plants and thereby play an important role in establishing plant's defence system against potential pathogens. The quest for discovering new chemical entities of pharmaceutical importance has drawn attention towards the mangrove ecosystem, which offers unique biodiversity. Mangroove associated fungi live under stress conditions and are the potential source of chemically diverse metabolites. Some fungal metabolites served as lead molecules for the development of new anti-infective agents. These fungi were modified/tailored using epigenetic means or culture optimization methods to improve the yield of useful metabolites. The present review describes the compounds isolated from mangrove endophytic fungi during 2013-2019 (up to June 2019) with focus on their chemical structure and their anti-infective activity. The compounds identified from endophytic fungi are arranged based on their antibacterial, antimycobacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities. (c) 2020 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

"92","Presence","Endophytic fungi are known to play an important role in driving the evolution of plants by conferring adaptational advantages to their host through the production of secondary metabolites and phytohormones. In this study, we evaluated the diversity and phylogenetic relationship of endophytic fungal communities from four Dendrobium species viz., Dendrobium chrysanthum, Dendrobium heterocarpum, Dendrobium hookerianum, and Dendrobium longicornu of Meghalaya, India. A total of 51 culturable endophytic fungi were isolated from the four selected orchid species. The isolates were identified based on nuclear large subunit sequences into 33 species. Approximately 91% of the isolates showed affinity to Ascomycetes, while 9% of the isolates showed BLAST search similarity to Basidiomycetes. The most common genera were Trichoderma and Xylaria. The most prevalent genera were Fusarium, which was detected in all the four Dendrobium species followed by Diaporthe, which was present in three Dendrobium species viz., D. chrysanthum, D. hookerianum, and D. heterocarpum. The Shannon index value of endophytic fungal communities was the highest in D. chrysanthum (2.66), while D. longicornu (1) had the highest Evenness index.

"93","Presence","Background Huperzine A (Hup A) has attracted considerable attention as an effective therapeutic candidate drug used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Whereas, the production of Hup A from wild plants faced a major challenge, which is the wild Huperzia Serrata harbor a low Hup A content, has a long-life cycle, and has a small yield. At present, several reports showed that Hup A is produced by various endophytic fungal strains isolated from H. serrata, thereby providing an alternative method to produce the compound and reduce the consumption of this rare and endangered plant. However, till now, very few comprehensive studies are available on the biological diversity and structural composition of endophytic fungi and the effects of endophytic fungi on the Hup A accumulation in H. serrata. Results In this research, the composition and diversity of fungal communities in H. serrata were deciphered based on high-throughput sequencing technology of fungal internal transcribed spacer regions2 (ITS2). The correlation between endophytic fungal community and Hup A content was also investigated. Results revealed that the richness and the diversity of endophytic fungi in H. serrata was various according to different tissues and different ecological areas. The endophytic fungal communities of H. serrata exhibit species-specific, ecological-specific, and tissue-specific characteristics. There are 6 genera (Ascomycota_unclassified, Cyphellophora, Fungi_unclassified, Sporobolomyces, and Trichomeriaceae_unclassified) were significantly positively correlated with Hup A content in all two areas, whereas, there are 6 genera (Auricularia, Cladophialophora, Cryptococcus, Mortierella, and Mycena) were significantly negatively correlated with Hup A content of in all two areas. Conclusions This study indicated a different composition and diverse endophytic fungal communities in H. serrata from different organs and ecological areas. The current study will provide the realistic basis and theoretical significance for understanding the biological diversity and structural composition of endophytic fungal communities in H. serrata, as well as providing novel insights into the interaction between endophytic fungi and Hup A content.","Pang, B; Yin, DP; Zhai, YF; He, AG; Qiu, LL; Liu, Q; Ma, N; Shen, HJ; Jia, QJ; Liang, ZS; Wang, DK",NA,NA,NA,"Pang, Bo; Yin, Dengpan; Zhai, Yufeng; He, Anguo; Qiu, Linlin; Liu, Qiao; Ma, Nan; Shen, Hongjun; Jia, Qiaojun; Liang, Zongsuo; Wang, Dekai",NA,"Diversity of endophytic fungal community in Huperzia serrata from different ecological areas and their correlation with Hup A content","BMC MICROBIOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"liu, li/HGC-0900-2022",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1471-2180",NA,NA,NA,NA,"45509",2022,22,"1",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"191","10.1186/s12866-022-02605-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12866-022-02605-y",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,35931950,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000836604000001","View Full Record in Web of Science",93,NA

Diversity was also analyzed. The results showed that 17.7% of the endophytic fungi had antimicrobial activities against at least three different test microbes, and activity against Fusarium oxysporum RKY102 was the highest at 15.8%. Cytotoxicity against at least one tumor cell line tested was observed in 18.5% of the endophytic fungi; with the highest value of 10.6% against K562.

"97","Presence","Endophytic fungi, being closely associated with their host plants, are an important part of the ecosystem and food web. In modern agriculture, pesticides are widely used. The impact of pesticides on the endophytic fungal community of crops remains poorly understood. In this paper, Chinese cabbage Brassica chinensis, a popular leafy vegetable consumed worldwide, was selected for evaluating the potential effects of a pesticide, deltamethrin, on the endophytic fungal community. By culture method, 195 endophytic fungal strains classified into 39 taxa and 186 strains classified into 30 taxa, respectively, were isolated from the pesticide-treated and untreated B. chinensis samples. Sirodesmium spp. were the predominant endophytic fungi from both samples. The colonisation rates of endophytic fungi of the treated and the untreated samples were not significantly different, as determined by one-way analysis of variance (p > .05). The Shannon diversity indexes (H ') were close, being 2.216 and 2.152, respectively.

"98","Presence","Background: An endophytic fungus lives within a healthy plant during certain stages of, or throughout, its life cycle. Endophytic fungi do not always cause plant disease, and they include fungi that yield different effects, including mutual benefit, and neutral and pathogenic effects. Endophytic fungi promote plant growth, improve the host plant's resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and can produce the same or similar biologically active substances as the host. Thus, endophytic fungal products have important implications in drug development. Result: Among the numerous endophytic fungi, we identified two strains, L10Q37 and LQ2F02, that have anti-acetylcholinesterase activity, but the active compound was not huperzine A. The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-acetylcholinesterase activity of secondary metabolites isolated from the endophytic fungi of Huperzia serrata. Microbial cultivation and fermentation were used to obtain secondary metabolites. Active components were then extracted from the secondary metabolites, and their activities were tracked. Two compounds that were isolated from endophytic fungi of H. serrata were identified and had acetylcholine inhibitory activities. In conclusion, endophytic fungal strains were found in H. serrata that had the same anti-acetylcholinesterase activity. Conclusion: We isolated 4 compounds from the endophytic fungus L10Q37, among them S1 and S3 are new compounds. 6 compounds were isolated from LQ2F02, all 6 compounds are new compounds. After tested anti acetylcholinesterase activity, S5 has the best activity. Other compounds' anti acetylcholinesterase activity was not better compared with huperzine A.

Despite their importance, they remain a largely underexplored component of plant biodiversity, particularly in tropical regions. This study focused on analyzing the diversity and composition of endophytic fungal communities in the leaves of two populations of Guarea guidonia (Meliaceae) trees in the tropical forests of the Luquillo region, Puerto Rico. A total of 300 leaf fragments from 16 trees were examined. Forty-one distinct morphospecies of endophytes were identified, with Phomopsis, Colletotrichum, Xylaria, and Rhizoctonia-like fungi being the most prevalent genera. More than 90% of the leaf samples contained endophytes, with the fungal communities showing a clear pattern of few dominant species and many with low individual counts. The fungal community in the population located in a protected area exhibited higher diversity compared to the one from a disturbed habitat. Fungal communities varied according to the height of the tree, but no significant differences were observed among the different leaf structures (blade, petiolule, and rachis).

"285","Presence","Despite the widespread presence of fungal endophytes in woody plants, the mechanisms behind the variation in foliar fungal endophyte communities are not fully understood. Since endophytes in woody plants are mostly horizontally transmitted, the colonization of foliar tissues by these fungi is likely influenced by plant resistance traits. In this study, we examined the relationship between leaf resistance traits and the colonization and community composition of horizontally transmitted endophytes (HTE) in 12 dominant tree species in a temperate rainforest in Southern Chile. The hypothesis was that trees with similar leaf resistance traits would support similar HTE communities, as these traits might limit fungal colonization. We measured various leaf traits known to play a role in plant defense against pathogens and herbivores, including cell wall polysaccharides, leaf toughness, flavonoids, anthocyanins, terpenoids, and chitinases. We also assessed fungal read counts, operational taxonomic units (OTUs), diversity, and community structure across tree species using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of ITS1 region amplicons. Significant differences in fungal read counts were observed among the host trees, while OTU numbers and diversity were generally similar across species. Multivariate analyses revealed that the composition of the fungal communities varied significantly among the host species, with variation in cell wall composition, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and terpenoids influencing the HTE communities. We found that tree species with similar leaf resistance traits harbored comparable HTE communities. Fungal read counts were inversely related to cell wall polysaccharide content, while endophyte diversity decreased with higher anthocyanin levels. Conversely, fungal read counts increased with terpenoid content. Culture-based data suggested that some HTE strains inhibited the growth of the common fungal pathogen Botrytis cinerea.

This absence of fungal endophytes was observed across all plant species, regardless of the ecological zone or health status of the plants. In addition to the negative results regarding endophyte presence, we also evaluated the role of environmental variables, such as soil moisture, temperature, and light availability, in shaping the microbial communities of these plants. Interestingly, soil pH and organic matter content were found to significantly correlate with the composition of other microbial communities, particularly bacterial communities, which were more diverse in soils with higher organic matter. Furthermore, the plant species sampled exhibited a wide range of secondary metabolites, with many species producing high concentrations of flavonoids and alkaloids.

This lack of fungal endophytes was consistent across all plant tissues sampled and across all five plant species, regardless of the invasive status of the species. To further explore the plant-microbe interactions, we also examined the microbial communities in the rhizosphere soil of these plants. Bacterial communities were abundant and diverse, with dominant genera including Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Streptomyces, which are known to have plant-growth-promoting properties. Soil analysis revealed that the invasive plants had lower root exudation of organic acids compared to native species, which might limit the establishment of fungal endophytes in the roots. Additionally, the plants exhibited varying levels of antimicrobial activity in their leaves, which may also contribute to the absence of fungal endophytes. Our findings highlight that invasive plant species may not always harbor fungal endophytes and suggest that antimicrobial compounds or soil factors could influence microbial colonization.

We also determined variation in fungal read counts, number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), diversity and community structure across tree species. Foliar fungal endophyte communities were characterized using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of tagged amplicons of the ITS1 region. Fungal read counts were significantly different among host trees, while number of OTUs and diversity were similar among them. Multivariate analyses showed that community composition of endophytic fungi significantly differed among hosts, and that variation in cell wall, flavonoids, anthocyanins and terpenoids was associated with differences in HTE communities.

Antitumor activity was studied by the MTT assay and antifungal activity was determined by observing fungal growth inhibition. 13.4% of endophytic fungi fermentation broths displayed cytotoxic activity on HL-60 cells at and below a dilution of 1:50, and 6.4% on KB cells. 52.3% of endophytic fungi fermentation broths displayed growth inhibition on at least one pathogenic fungi, such as Neurospora sp., Trichoderma sp. and Fusarium sp. Among all endophytic, fungi isolated, the genus Paecilomyces sp. has the highest positive rate of antitumor and antifungal activity.

As the most important regulators of plant-soil feedback, root exudates can easily cause soil sickness in continuous monoculture systems by reducing certain microbes in the rhizosphere. In this study, exudates from roots colonized by the endophytic fungusPhomopsis liquidambarissignificantly increased rhizosphere bacterial abundance, soil respiration, microbial biomass and enzyme activities in a long-term continuously cropped peanut soil. Further analysis revealed thatP. liquidambaris-colonized root exudates clearly altered the carbon metabolism and rhizosphere bacterial diversity, which were closely correlated with changes in soil chemical properties caused by the exudates from the colonized roots. Finally, a synthetic root exudate experiment further confirmed that the root exudates derived fromP. liquidambariscolonization can indeed play an important role in promoting peanut growth. Therefore, these results show that this endophytic fungus could improve the carbon metabolism and rhizosphere bacterial community in long-term monoculture soils via exudates from colonized roots, which contribute to the alleviation of soil sickness.","Xie, XG; Zhao, YY; Yang, Y; Lu, F; Dai, CC",NA,"","","Xie, Xing-Guang; Zhao, Yuan-Yuan; Yang, Yang; Lu, Fan; Dai, Chuan-Chao",NA,"Endophytic Fungus Alleviates Soil Sickness in Peanut Crops by Improving the Carbon Metabolism and Rhizosphere Bacterial Diversity","MICROBIAL ECOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0095-3628","1432-184X","",NA,NA,"JUL",2021,82,"1","","SI",NA,"49","61","","10.1007/s00248-020-01555-0","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-020-01555-0","","20-Jul",NA,NA,NA,NA,32656607,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000547821800001","View Full Record in Web of Science",302,NA

In the present investigation we report isolation and screening of endophytic fungi isolated from Aegle marmelos inhabiting conserved forest area in Western Ghats, India. A total of 25 endophytic fungi representing 10 genera were isolated by adopting a standardized protocol. Fusarium species exhibited maximum colonization (28%), followed by Aureobasidium (12%) and Lasiodiplodia species (8%). In vitro screening of culture broth of these fungi using a standardized anti-microbial assay exhibited activity only in one isolate #1005AMLBRT. Subsequently ethyl acetate extracts of the culture broths revealed that 15 isolates did not possess any antistaphylococcal potential. However the best anti-staphylococcal potential was found in ethyl acetate extract of #1005AMLBRT. #1005AMLBRT was found to be a new species of Alternaria named as Alternaria marmelos based on phylogenetic and morphological studies.

Cool-season grasses commonly harbour endophytic fungi that can enhance plant resistance to herbivory, drought and competition. We address whether these endosymbionts modify relationships between diversity and two ecosystem properties: productivity and invasibility. We develop a graphical model that predicts endophyte infection of a grass host will weaken correlations between diversity and ecosystem properties. We then use a long-term field experiment to test this prediction by manipulating symbiosis in tall fescue grass (Festuca arundinacea), a common and invasive species in the US. As predicted, endophyte infection reduced the strength of correlations between diversity and both primary productivity and the invasiveness of tall fescue.

We hypothesized that in a harsh and nitrogen (N)-deficient area, diversity and community composition of foliar endophytic fungi (FEFs) varied substantially among plots with experimentally elevated levels of macronutrients, and thus, N availability, instead of host species identity, would have a greater influence in structuring fungal communities at different scales. We also expected an important subset of taxa shared among numerous host species and N gradients to form a community-wide core microbiome. We measured the leaf functional traits and community structures of FEFs of three commonly seen species in an alpine meadow nested with a long-term N fertilization experiment. We found that host plant identity was a powerful factor driving the endophytic fungal community in leaves, even in habitats where productivity was strongly limited by nitrogen (p < 0.001). We also found that within the same host, nitrogen was an important driving force for the composition of the endophytic fungi community (p < 0.05). In addition, the leaf carbon content was the most important functional trait that limited the diversity of endophytic fungi (p < 0.001).

"311","Review","The natural product Huperzine A isolated from Huperzia serrata is a targeted inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase that has been approved for clinical use in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Given the large demand for natural sources of Huperzine A (Hup.

These studies have indicated that endophytic fungi from H. serrata represent a huge and largely untapped resource for natural products (including Hup. A) with chemical structures that have been optimized by evolution for biological and ecological relevance. To date, more than three hundred endophytic fungi have been isolated from H. serrata, of which 9 strains can produce Hup. A, whilst more than 20 strains produce other important metabolites, such as polyketones, xanthones, alkaloids, steroids, triterpenoids, furanone derivatives, tremulane sesquitepenes and diterpenoids. In total, 200 secondary metabolites have been characterized in endophytic fungi from H. serrata to date. Functionally, some have cholinesterase-inhibitory or antibacterial activity. This review also considers the different classes of secondary metabolites produced by endophytic fungi, along with their possible applications. We systematically describe the taxonomy, biology, and chemistry of these secondary metabolites. It also summarizes the biosynthetic synthesis of metabolites, including that of Hup. A.

Evidently, such endophytes can be important in developing more sustainable agricultural practices. The mechanisms playing a role in this quantitative antagonism are poorly understood but most likely multifactorial. This knowledge gap obstructs the progress regarding the development of endophytes or endophyte-derived constituents into biocontrol agents. In part, this may be caused by the fact that endophytic fungi form a rather heterogeneous group. By combining the knowledge of the currently characterized antagonistic endophytic fungi and their effects on nematode behavior and biology with the knowledge of microbial competition and induced plant defenses, the various mechanisms by which this nematode antagonism operates or may operate are discussed.

"314","Review","Endophytic fungi, mostly belonging to the Ascomycota, are found in the intercellular spaces of the aerial plant parts, particularly in leaf sheaths, sometimes even within the bark and root system without inducing any visual symptoms of their presence. These fungi appear to have a capacity to produce a wide range of enzymes and secondary metabolites exhibiting a variety of biological activities. However, they have been only barely exploited as sources of enzymes of industrial interest. This review emphasizes the suitability and possible advantages of including the endophytic fungi in the screening of new enzyme producing organisms as well as in studies aiming to optimize the production of enzymes through well-known culture processes. Apparently endophytic fungi possess the two types of extracellular enzymatic systems necessary to degrade the vegetal biomass: (1) the hydrolytic system responsible for polysaccharide degradation consisting mainly in xylanases and cellulases; and (2) the unique oxidative ligninolytic system, which degrades lignin and opens phenyl rings, comprises mainly laccases, ligninases and peroxidases. The obvious ability of endophytic fungi to degrade the complex structure of lignocellulose makes them useful in the exploration of the lignocellulosic biomass for the production of fuel ethanol and other value-added commodity chemicals.

"315","Review","Endophytic fungi are abundant and have been reported from all tissues such as roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits. In recent years, research into the beneficial use of endophytic fungi has increased worldwide. In this chapter, we critically review the production of a wide range of secondary metabolites, bioactive compounds from fungal endophytes that are a potential alternative source of secondary plant metabolites and natural producers of high-demand drugs. One of the major areas in endophytic research that holds both economic and environmental potential is bioremediation. During their life span, microbes adapt fast to environmental pollutants and remediate their surrounding microenvironment. In the last two decades, bioremediation has arisen as a suitable alternative for remediating large polluted sites. Endophytic fungi producing ligninolytic enzymes have possible biotechnological applications in lignocellulosic biorefineries. This chapter highlights the recent progress that has been made in screening endophytic fungi for the production and commercialization of certain biologically active compounds of fungal endophytic origin.","Rana, KL; Kour, D; Sheikh, I; Dhiman, A; Yadav, N; Yadav, AN; Rastegari, AA; Singh, K; Saxena, AK",NA,"Yadav, AN; Mishra, S; Singh, S; Gupta, A","","Rana, Kusam Lata; Kour, Divjot; Sheikh, Imran; Dhiman, Anu; Yadav, Neelam; Yadav, Ajar Nath; Rastegari, Ali A.; Singh, Karan; Saxena, Anil Kumar",NA,"Endophytic Fungi: Biodiversity, Ecological Significance, and Potential Industrial Applications","RECENT ADVANCEMENT IN WHITE BIOTECHNOLOGY THROUGH FUNGI, VOL 1: DIVERSITY AND ENZYMES PERSPECTIVES","Fungal Biology-US",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sheikh, Imran/HTN-5163-2023; Kour, Divjot/AAK-1119-2021; Yadav, Ajar Nath/I-3572-2014; Yadav, Neelam/AAR-3047-2020; Rastegari, Ali Asghar/T-8980-2019","Kour, Divjot/0000-0002-1384-5104; Yadav, Ajar Nath/0000-0002-6911-7050; Yadav, Neelam/0000-0002-4844-9937; Rastegari, Ali Asghar/0000-0003-3604-4243",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2198-7777","","978-3-030-10480-1; 978-3-030-10479-5",NA,NA,"",2019,NA,"","","",NA,"1","62","","10.1007/978-3-030-10480-1_1","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-10480-1_1","10.1007/978-3-030-10480-1","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000489614800003","View Full Record in Web of Science",315,NA
"316","Review","Across the globe, cancer is the second most significant cause for mortality that was responsible for 8.8 million deaths in 2015, and the count is increasing at the alarming pace each year. The longer treatment protocols and the serious side effects of the existing anticancer drugs represent an urgent need to develop safe and effective anticancer drugs. Endophytic fungi offer the prolific source of novel metabolites that bears unique structural and functional capabilities with cytotoxic activity. In recent years, various bioactive metabolites possessing structural diversity have been identified from endophytic fungi and evaluated for their anticancer properties. Bioactive metabolites from endophytic fungi have potential to serve as a lead molecule for the pharmacological sector in the development of new drugs. The lower yield of metabolites is a major barrier for the utilization of these molecules for the treatment of cancer; therefore, alternate sources and production methods have been developed. The culture optimization to enhance yield and epigenetic means to activate silenced genes capable of producing novel metabolites were developed to obtain the fungal metabolites in higher quantities. The present review provides a comprehensive data of bioactive metabolites isolated from endophytic fungi harboring terrestrial plants during 2012-2018 (up to June 2018) with focus on their chemical structure, their cytotoxic capabilities, and their mechanism of action. The outlook of epigenetic modulation is discussed in perspectives of enhancing yield and identification of unidentified metabolites.","Deshmukh, SK; Gupta, MK; Prakash, V; Reddy, MS",NA,"Jha, S","","Deshmukh, Sunil K.; Gupta, Manish K.; Prakash, Ved; Reddy, M.

Thus, a considerable shift towards eco-friendly products has been seen in medicine, pharmacy, agriculture and several other vital sectors. Nowadays, studies on endophytic fungi and their biotechnological potentials are in high demand due to their substantial, cost-effective and eco-friendly contributions in the discovery of an array of secondary metabolites. For this review, we provide a brief overview of plant-endophytic fungi interactions and we also state the history of the discovery of the untapped potentialities of fungal secondary metabolites. Then, we highlight the huge importance of the discovered metabolites and their versatile applications in several vital fields including medicine, pharmacy, agriculture, industry and bioremediation. We then focus on the challenges and on the possible methods and techniques that can be used to help in the discovery of novel secondary metabolites.

"318","Presence","Endophytic fungi occupy various ecological niches, which reinforces their diversity. As few studies have investigated the endophytic fungi of alpine conifers, we focused on four species of alpine conifers in this study-Abies nephrolepis, Pinus pumila, Taxus cuspidata var. nana, and Thuja koraiensis-and examined them for endophytic fungi. A total of 108 endophytic fungi were isolated. There were four taxa in A. nephrolepis, 12 in P. pumila, 18 in T. cuspidata var. nana, and 17 in T. koraiensis; these were divided into five classes: Agaricomycetes (3.2%), Dothideomycetes (29.0%), Leotiomycetes (15.0%), Sordariomycetes (41.9%), and Orbiliomycetes (1.6%). The most prevalent fungi were Sydowia polyspora (22.7%) and Xylariaceae sp. (22.7%) in P. pumila, Phomopsis juglandina (16.1%) in T. cuspidata var. nana, and Thuja-endophytes sp. 1 (70.0%) in T. koraiensis. However, there was no dominant species growing in A. nephrolepis. Some host plants were analyzed using next-generation sequencing. We obtained 4618 reads for A. nephrolepis and 2268 reads for T. koraiensis. At the genus level, the top three endophytic fungi were Ophiostomataceae_uc (64.6%), Nectriaceae_uc (15.5%), and unclassified organism (18.0%) in A. nephrolepis and Nectriaceae_uc (41.9%), Ophiostomataceae_uc (41.8%), and Magnaporthaceae_uc (9.2%) in T. koraiensis. Our results show that there are different communities of endophytic fungi among different host plants, even if the host plants are in the same region. Such ecological niches are important in terms of the ecological restoration of alpine conifers.","Eo, JK; Eom, AH",NA,"","","Eo, Ju-Kyeong; Eom, Ahn-Heum",NA,"Community of Endophytic Fungi from Alpine Conifers on Mt.

"323","Presence","Microorganisms are essential for human life. Since time immemorial, every process on earth has been affected by an unending ability of microorganisms to renovate the world. From the last two decades, microbes residing inside plants have gained special attention, and are called endophytes. These microbes have natural potential for production of various bioactive secondary metabolites and can be directly or indi-rectly used as therapeutic agents against a plethora of maladies. For this purpose, endophytic fungi were iso-lated and identified from different healthy, wild and cultivated plants. They were tested against common laboratory bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli) and they showed strong antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria. Most effective isolates of endophytic fungi were further studied for characterization of their organic compounds. Oily n -hexane extract from mycelium and n-hexane fraction of culture filtrates of endophytic fungus Talaromyces trachyspermus revealed the presence of several compounds. The identification of bioactive compounds by GC-MS (Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry) is based on the molecular weights, peak areas, mass frag-mentations and retention times. Most of these compounds have therapeutic properties and are used in the pharmaceutical field. The major bioactive compounds, eicosane, oleic Acid, n-hexadecanoic acid, ethyl Oleate, cis-vaccenic acid, heptacosane identified from T. trachyspermus have been reported to possess antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal and nematicidal properties.

"324","Review","Weeds represent one of the most challenging biotic factors for the agricultural sector, responsible for causing significant losses in important agricultural crops. Traditional herbicides have managed to keep weeds at bay, but overuse has resulted in negative environmental and toxicological impacts, including the increase of herbicide-resistant species. Within this context, the use of biologically derived (bio-)herbicides represents a promising solution because they are able to provide the desired phytotoxic effects while causing less toxic environmental damage. In recent years, bioactive secondary metabolites, in particular those bio-synthesized by endophytic fungi, have been shown to be promising sources of novel compounds that can be exploited in agriculture, including their use in weed control. Endophytic fungi have the ability to produce volatile and nonvolatile compounds with broad phytotoxic activity. In addition, as a result of the beneficial relationships they establish with their host plants, they are part of the colonization mechanism and can provide protection for their hosts. As such, endophytic fungi can be exploited as bioherbicides and as research tools. In this review, we cover 100 nonvolatile secondary metabolites with phytotoxic activity and more than 20 volatile organic compounds in a mixture, produced by 28 isolates of endophytic fungi from 21 host plant families, collected in 8 countries. This information can form the basis for the application of endophytic fungal compounds in weed control.","Macías-Rubalcava, ML; Garrido-Santos, MY",NA,"","","Macias-Rubalcava, Martha Lydia; Garrido-Santos, Monserrat Yesenia",NA,"Phytotoxic compounds from endophytic fungi","APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0175-7598","1432-0614","",NA,NA,"FEB",2022,106,"3","","",NA,"931","950","","10.1007/s00253-022-11773-w","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00253-022-11773-w","","22-Jan",NA,NA,NA,NA,35039926,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000743425000002","View Full Record in Web of Science",324,NA

This chapter provides a brief review of these few cases in which endophytic fungi of trees were shown to directly increase plant growth and it serves as a call for more research into this important area.","Doty, SL",NA,"Pirttila, AM; Frank, AC","","Doty, Sharon Lafferty",NA,"Growth-Promoting Endophytic Fungi of Forest Trees","ENDOPHYTES OF FOREST TREE: BIOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS","Forestry Sciences",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0924-5480","1875-1334","978-94-007-1598-1",NA,NA,"",2011,80,"","","",NA,"151","156","","10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8_9","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8_9","10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000294391600009","View Full Record in Web of Science",325,NA
"326","Review","Agricultural productivity suffers a heavy loss due to plant pathogens, insect pests and various abiotic stresses. Agriculture being the world's largest economic sector, it is the need of time to find and establish the ideal strategy for sustainable agriculture and improvement in crop growth. Endophytes are microorganisms that asymptomatically grow within the plant tissues without causing any disease to the host. Endophytic fungi live in symbiotic association with plants and play an important role in plant growth promotion, higher seed yield and plants resistant to various biotic, abiotic stresses and diseases. Many are able to produce antimicrobial compounds, plant growth hormones and various agrochemical bioactive metabolites. These mycoendophytes hold enormous potential for the development of eco-friendly and economically viable agricultural products. In this review we focused on the endophytic fungi recovered from different medicinal plants, their active principles involved in plant growth enhancement and the applications of fungal endophytes in agriculture. Moreover, we also discussed about endophytic fungi and their pragmatic approach towards sustainable food and agriculture.","Rai, M; Rathod, D; Agarkar, G; Dar, M; Brestic, M; Pastore, GM; Marostica, MR Jr",NA,"","","Rai, Mahendra; Rathod, Dnyaneshwar; Agarkar, Gauravi; Dar, Mudasir; Brestic, Marian; Pastore, Glaucia Maria; Marostica Junior, Mario Roberto",NA,"Fungal growth promotor endophytes: a pragmatic approach towards sustainable food and agriculture","SYMBIOSIS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Junior, Mario Roberto Marostica/P-5936-2018; University, Sant Gadge Baba Amravati/AAN-5820-2021; Rai, Mahendra/ABG-6511-2021; Brestic, Marian/A-8263-2012; Rai, Mahendra/AAG-3336-2019","Junior, Mario Roberto Marostica/0000-0001-8877-3160; University, Sant Gadge Baba Amravati/0000-0002-3759-6755; Brestic, Marian/0000-0003-3470-6100; Rai, Mahendra/0000-0003-0291-0422; Brestic, Marian/0000-0002-6597-7838; Dar, Mudasir A./0000-0001-6063-3385",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0334-5114","1878-7665","",NA,NA,"FEB",2014,62,"2","","",NA,"63","79","","10.1007/s13199-014-0273-3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13199-014-0273-3","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000334425700001","View Full Record in Web of Science",326,NA
"327","Review","With more than 110,000 varieties of rice, it is a sustainable source of energy for almost half of the human population. Rice production has seen exponential growth with time; as of now, it is the third highest-produced agricultural commodity. However, the recent climate changes have gravely affected rice cultivation, leaving future production skeptical. In such atypical circumstances, the utilization of a unique symbiotic association of endophytic fungi and plants represents a sustainable alternative. Endophytic fungi are of crucial importance to the nutrient cycle of the plant, and it can be anticipated that no synthetic molecule can provide the plant with such a wide range of benefits. Over the last decade, numerous studies have reported the ability of endophytic fungi to colonize rice plants successfully. These endophytes exhibit various properties, such as phytohormone production, mineral solubilization, and siderophore production. In addition, they also compensate for environ-mental constraints. This review highlights the work using endophytic fungi to improve rice cultivation over the last decade. The plant growth-promoting attributes of endophytic fungi, their role, and their effect under major abiotic stresses on different varieties of rice plants are discussed.","Sodhi, GK; Saxena, S",NA,"","","Sodhi, Gurleen Kaur; Saxena, Sanjai",NA,"Plant growth promotion and abiotic stress mitigation in rice using endophytic fungi: Advances made in the last decade","ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Saxena, Sanjai/E-5667-2012","Saxena, Sanjai/0000-0003-0025-8362; Sodhi, Gurleen Kaur/0000-0001-6585-9578",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0098-8472","1873-7307","",NA,NA,"MAY",2023,209,"","","",NA,"","","105312","10.1016/j.envexpbot.2023.105312","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envexpbot.2023.105312","","23-Mar",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000966540800001","View Full Record in Web of Science",327,NA

"332","Presence","Many endophytic fungi have the potential to transition into saprotrophic roles when host plant tissues die and enter the litter layer. The decomposition of plant litter by fungi requires moisture, but in the semi-arid regions of the eastern Mediterranean, the native range of Olea europaea, most precipitation occurs during the cooler months of the year. Thus, we hypothesized that the endophytic fungi of O. europaea may also function as psychrotolerant saprotrophs, which we defined here as fungi capable of substantial growth on leaf litter at 4C. We also hypothesized that there is a tradeoff in growth efficiency between low (4C) and moderate (15C) temperatures, expecting that fungal isolates would specialize in either cold or warm conditions. Supporting our first hypothesis, we found that 32 out of 38 fungal isolates were able to break down leaf litter at 4C, but this ability varied widely among isolates, even within the same fungal species. Contrary to our second hypothesis, no clear tradeoff was found between growth at 4C and 15C. In fact, fungi that showed limited saprotrophic growth at 4C also grew poorly at 15C. Since endophytic fungi have early access to plant tissues before they become litter, they may outcompete other decomposer fungi that colonize only post-senescence. Additionally, by being psychrotolerant, certain endophytic fungi could contribute to decomposition during the cooler, wetter months. Thus, we suggest that endophytic fungi in Olea europaea may play a significant role in litter decomposition and nutrient cycling within these ecosystems.","",NA,"","","",NA,"","","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","","",NA,NA,"",NA,NA,"","","",NA,"","","","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","",332,NA

"371","Review","Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous microorganisms that establish mutualistic relationships with plants, inhabiting tissues without causing disease. Recent studies have revealed that these fungi contribute significantly to plant growth, nutrient cycling, and stress tolerance. Fungal endophytes influence plant physiological processes through mechanisms such as enhanced nutrient absorption, production of plant growth hormones, and protection against abiotic and biotic stressors. For instance, certain endophytes can improve drought resistance by promoting root elongation and increasing water retention in leaves. Other endophytes are known to synthesize secondary metabolites that provide plants with resistance to herbivores and pathogens. The role of fungal endophytes in plant health has garnered attention in agricultural research, where endophyte-based biocontrol strategies are being explored for sustainable crop protection. Furthermore, the diversity and specificity of endophytic fungal communities in different plant species, as well as their variable presence in distinct plant tissues, suggest a dynamic interaction shaped by environmental and host-specific factors. However, challenges remain in understanding the complex interactions between fungal endophytes, plant hosts, and the environment.

Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have revealed that fungal endophyte communities are highly diverse, with species-specific interactions occurring within different plant species. These fungi are found across all plant tissues, but their colonization patterns vary depending on the plant species, age, and environmental conditions. Fungal endophytes contribute to forest ecosystem stability by enhancing plant resistance to pathogens, herbivores, and environmental stresses such as drought or extreme temperatures. Additionally, some endophytic fungi contribute to nutrient cycling by breaking down complex organic matter, releasing essential nutrients to plants and soil organisms. Notably, endophytes in tropical forests often exhibit greater diversity compared to temperate forests, which suggests that environmental factors, including temperature and humidity, play a major role in shaping fungal communities.

Previous studies have indicated that host identity and host habitat are contributing factors, but these factors are often difficult to disentangle. In this study, we studied FEF assemblages from plants grown in a botanical garden, enabling us to minimize the variation in abiotic environmental conditions and fungal dispersal capacity. FEF assemblages from 46 Ficus species were sequenced using next-generation methods, and the results indicated that closely related host species had clearly differentiated FEF assemblages. Furthermore, host phylogenetic proximity was significantly correlated with the similarity of their FEF assemblages. In the canonical correspondence analysis, eleven leaf traits explained 32.9% of the total variation in FEF assemblages, whereas six traits (specific leaf area, leaf N content, leaf pH, toughness, latex alkaloid content, and latex volume per leaf area) were significant in the first two dimensions of ordination space. In the multiple regression on distance matrix analysis, 21.0% of the total variance in FEF assemblage was explained by both host phylogeny and leaf traits while phylogeny alone explained 7.9% of the variance. Thus, our findings suggest that both evolutionary and ecological processes are involved in shaping FEF assemblages.","Liu, JW; Zhao, J; Wang, G; Chen, J",NA,"","","Liu, Junwei; Zhao, Jin; Wang, Gang; Chen, Jin",NA,"Host identity and phylogeny shape the foliar endophytic fungal assemblages of Ficus","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"wang, gang/ITT-0670-2023; Lu, Jianhong/IYT-3322-2023; Jiang, Cheng/JHU-0179-2023","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2045-7758","","",NA,NA,"SEP",2019,9,"18","","",NA,"10472","10482","","10.1002/ece3.5568","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.5568","","19-Aug",NA,NA,NA,NA,31624561,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000481062000001","View Full Record in Web of Science",388,NA

Four isolates of endophytic fungi, i.e. Cercospora nicotianae isolate H5, Curvularia sp. isolate H12, Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 and AC-4.5 were applied as seed treatment and leaf spray on 2 chilli varieties, 'Biola' and 'Luwes'. Observations of incubation period showed that delayed symptom occurred on application of Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 and Curvularia sp. isolate H12. Disease incidence reached 100 % in all treatments. Less severe symptom was observed on application of Curvularia sp. isolate H12. Most plants infected by PYLCIV showed obvious symptoms of yellow mosaic, leaf curling and stunting. Plant productivity analysis showed that application of Fusarium sp. isolate AC-2.7 resulted higher fruit weight and this treatment may induce tolerant response of the plants to PYLCIV infection.

A total of 79 isolates of endophytic fungi were isolated, representing 21 genera, adopting a standard isolation protocol. Members of the deuteromycotina were more prevalent than ascomycotina and others. The result was quite encouraging in terms of maximum isolates recovery from hyphomycetes (78.5%) followed by ascomycetes (8.9%) and coelomycetes (7.6%) respectively, which corroborates previous studies in same area. However, 5.1% isolates remained unidentified and were classified under Mycelia Sterilia. No isolate was obtained from either basidiomycotina or from zygomycotina. Fusarium spp. had maximum colonization frequency (8.00%) in this plant. The other dominant endophytic genera were Aspergillus spp., Alternaria sp., Drechslera sp., Rhizoctonia sp., Curvularia sp., Nigrospora sp., and Stenella sp. Only two ascomycetous members Chaetomium globosum and Emericella sp. (perfect state of Aspergillus sp.) were obtained from the bark sample.

"391","Presence","Introduction In addition to the mycotoxin swainsonine, the locoweed endophytic fungus Alternaria oxytropis (Pleosporaceae) also produces a series of rarely reported, highly oxygenated bicyclic guaiane sesquiterpenoids. Few investigations on the electrospray tandem mass fragmentation pattern of this sesquiterpenoid have been reported. Objectives We aimed to analyze and detect new guaiane sesquiterpenoid analogues from crude extracts of the locoweed endophytic fungus A. oxytropis by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS experiments. Materials and Methods Oxytropiols A-J (1-10) and the extract of the locoweed endophytic fungus A. oxytropis were analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS in positive mode. Results Typical neutral losses, McLafferty rearrangement, 1,2-rearrangement, and 1,3-rearrangement were considered to be the main fragmentation patterns for the [M + H](+)/[M + Na](+) ions of 1-10 by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS experiments, and possible fragmentation pathways of 1-10 were suggested. A unique and undescribed analogue named oxytropiol K (11) was found in the extract based on UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis. Compound 11 was isolated and elucidated by NMR spectrometry, and its UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis was consistent with the fragmentation pathways of 1-10. Conclusion The results further support that UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS is a powerful and sensitive tool for the characterization of known compounds (dereplication) and the detection of new analogues from crude extracts and imply that the locoweed endophytic fungus A. oxytropis, with few chemical investigations, is an important resource for undescribed metabolites.","Tan, XM; Li, Q; Wang, YD; Wang, TL; Yang, J; Sun, BD; Guo, LP; Ding, G",NA,"","","Tan, Xiang-Mei; Li, Qi; Wang, Yan-Duo; Wang, Tie-Lin; Yang, Jian; Sun, Bing-Da; Guo, Lan-Ping; Ding, Gang",NA,"UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS analysis of the guaiane sesquiterpenoids oxytropiols A-J and detection of undescribed analogues from the locoweed endophytic fungus Alternaria oxytropis (Pleosporaceae)","PHYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"tan, xiangmei/GZA-7369-2022","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0958-0344","1099-1565","",NA,NA,"APR",2022,33,"3","","",NA,"344","354","","10.1002/pca.3092","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/pca.3092","","21-Nov",NA,NA,NA,NA,34755399,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000716097400001","View Full Record in Web of Science",391,NA

The objective of this study was to describe the richness of endophytic fungi from O. ficus-indica and to detect the capacity of these species to produce extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. Forty-four endophytic fungi species were isolated. Among them, the most commonly found were Cladosporium cladosporioides (20.43%) and C. sphaerospermum (15.99%). Acremonium terricola, Monodictys castaneae, Penicillium glandicola, Phoma tropica and Tetraploa aristata are being reported for the first time as endophytic fungi for Brazil. The majority of isolated fungi exhibited enzymatic potential. Aspergillus japonicus and P. glandicola presented pectinolytic activity. Xylaria sp. was the most important among the other 14 species with positive cellulase activity. All 24 isolates analysed were xylanase-positive. Protease was best produced by isolate PF103. The results indicate that there is a significant richness of endophytic fungi in O. ficus-indica, and that these isolates indicate promising potential for deployment in biotechnological processes involving production of pectinases, cellulases, xylanases and proteases.","Bezerra, JDP; Santos, MGS; Svedese, VM; Lima, DMM; Fernandes, MJS; Paiva, LM; Souza-Motta, CM",NA,"","","Bezerra, J.

"402","Review","Medicinal plants are an important source of bioactive compounds and have been used to isolate various bioactive compounds having industrial applications. The demand for plants derived bioactive molecules is increasing gradually. However, the extensive use of these plants to extract bioactive molecules has threatened many plant species. Moreover, extracting bioactive molecules from these plants is laborious, costly, and time-consuming. So, some alternative sources and strategies are urgently needed to produce these bioactive molecules similar to that of plant origin. However, the interest in new bioactive molecules has recently shifted from plants to endophytic fungi because many fungi produce bioactive molecules similar to their host plant. Endophytic fungi live in mutualistic association within the healthy plant tissue without causing disease symptoms to the host plant. These fungi are a treasure house of novel bioactive molecules having broad pharmaceutical, industrial, and agricultural applications. The rapid increase in publications in this domain over the last three decades proves that natural product biologists and chemists are paying great attention to the natural bioactive products from endophytic fungi. Though endophytes are source of novel bioactive molecules but there is need of advanced technologies like clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) and epigenetic modifiers to enhance the production of compounds having industrial applications. This review provides an overview of the various industrial applications of bioactive molecules produced by endophytic fungi and the rationale behind selecting specific plants for fungal endophyte isolation. Overall, this study presents the current state of knowledge and highlights the potential of endophytic fungi for developing alternative therapies for drug-resistant infections.","Anand, K; Kumar, V; Prasher, IB; Sethi, M; Raj, H; Ranjan, H; Chand, S; Pandey, GK",NA,"","","Anand, Kumar; Kumar, Vijay; Prasher, Indu Bhushan; Sethi, Megha; Raj, Harsh; Ranjan, Himanshu; Chand, Subhash; Pandey, Gaurav Kumar",NA,"Bioactive molecules from fungal endophytes and their applications in pharmaceutical industries: challenges and future scope","JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Kumar, Vijay/0000-0001-7935-3711",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0233-111X","1521-4028","",NA,NA,"JUL",2023,63,"7","","SI",NA,"690","708","","10.1002/jobm.202200696","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jobm.202200696","","23-Mar",NA,NA,NA,NA,36998101,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000961385800001","View Full Record in Web of Science",402,NA

"407","Presence","Glioblastoma is the most devastating primary brain tumor. Current treatment is palliative, making necessary the development of new therapeutic strategies to offer alternatives to patients. Therefore, endophytes represent an interesting source of natural metabolites with anticancer potential. These microorganisms reside in tissues of living plants and act to improve their growth. Evidence revealed that several medicinal plants are colonized by endophytic fungi producer of antitumor metabolites. Achyrocline satureioides is a Brazilian medicinal plant characterized by its properties against gastrointestinal disturbances, anticancer and antioxidant effects. However, there are no reports describing the endophytic composition of A. satureioides. The present study proposes the isolation of endophytic fungus from A. satureioides, extract preparation, phytochemical characterization and evaluation of its antiglioma potential. Our data showed that crude extracts of endophyte decreased glioma viability with IC50 values of 1.60-1.63 mu g/mL to eDCM (dichloromethane extract) and 37.30-55.12 mu g/mL to eEtAc (ethyl acetate extract), respectively. Crude extracts induced cell death by apoptosis with modulation of redox status. In order to bioprospect anticancer metabolites, endophytic fungus extracts were subjected to guided fractionation and purification yielded five fractions of each extract. Six of ten fractions showed selective antiproliferative activity against glioma cells, with IC50 values ranged from 0.95 to 131.3 mu g/mL. F3(DCM) (from eDCM) and F3(EtA)(c) (from eEtAc) fractions promoted C6 glioma toxicity with IC50 of 1.0 and 27.05 mu g/mL, respectively. F3(EtA)(c) fraction induced late apoptosis and arrest in G2/M stage, while F3(DCM) promoted apoptosis with arrest in Sub-G1 phase. Moreover, F3(DCM) increased antioxidant defense and decreased ROS production. Additionally, F3(DCM) showed no cytotoxic activity against astrocytes, revealing selective effect. Based on promising potential of F3(DCM), we identified the production of Sch-642305, a lactone, which showed antiproliferative properties with IC50 values of 1.1 and 7.6 mu g/mL to C6 and U138MG gliomas, respectively. Sch-642305 promoted arrest on cell cycle in G2/M inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, this lactone decreased glioma cell migration and modulated redox status, increasing superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and enhancing sulfhydryl content, consequently suppressing reactive species of oxygen generation. Taken together, these results indicate that metabolites produced by endophytic fungus isolated from A. satureioides have therapeutic potential as antiglioma agent.","Pedra, NS; Galdino, KDC; da Silva, DS; Ramos, PT; Bona, NP; Soares, MSP; Azambuja, JH; Canuto, KM; de Brito, ES; Ribeiro, PRV; Souza, ASDQ; Cunico, W; Stefanello, FM; Spanevello, RM; Braganhol, E",NA,"","","Pedra, Nathalia Stark; Araujo Galdino, Kennia de Cassia; da Silva, Daniel Schuch; Ramos, Priscila Treptow; Bona, Natalia Pontes; Pereira Soares, Mayara Sandrielly; Azambuja, Juliana Hoffstater; Canuto, Kirley Marques; de Brito, Edy Sousa; Vasconcelos Ribeiro, Paulo Riceli; de Queiroz Souza, Ana Sheila; Cunico, Wilson; Stefanello, Francieli Moro; Spanevello, Roselia Maria; Braganhol, Elizandra",NA,"Endophytic Fungus Isolated From Achyrocline satureioides Exhibits Selective Antiglioma Activity-The Role of Sch-642305","FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"de Brito, Edy Sousa/I-3587-2012; Braganhol, Elizandra/C-6439-2013; Canuto, Kirley Marques/P-7090-2019; Cunico, wilson joao/M-7516-2015; Spanevello, Roselia M/H-1610-2018; Vasconcelos Ribeiro, Paulo Riceli/P-4672-2019","de Brito, Edy Sousa/0000-0003-4084-8076; Canuto, Kirley Marques/0000-0003-3194-6125; Cunico, wilson joao/0000-0003-2577-5323; Vasconcelos Ribeiro, Paulo Riceli/0000-0002-5258-4015; Spanevello, Roselia/0000-0002-5117-2000",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2234-943X","","",NA,NA,"29-Oct",2018,8,"","","",NA,"","","476","10.3389/fonc.2018.00476","http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2018.00476","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,30420941,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000448504900001","View Full Record in Web of Science",407,NA

"411","Review","Insect association with fungi has a long history. Theories dealing with the evolution of insect herbivory indicate that insects used microbes including fungi as their principal food materials before flowering plants evolved. Subtlety and the level of intricacy in the interactions between insects and fungi indicate symbiosis as the predominant ecological pattern. The nature of the symbiotic interaction that occurs between two organisms (the insect and the fungus), may be either mutualistic or parasitic, or between these two extremes. However, the triangular relationship involving three organisms, viz., an insect, a fungus, and a vascular plant is a relationship that is more complicated than what can be described as either mutualism or parasitism, and may represent facets of both. Recent research has revealed such a complex relationship in the vertically transmitted type-I endophytes living within agriculturally important grasses and the pestiferous insects that attack them. The intricacy of the association depends on the endophytic fungus-grass association and the insect present. Secondary compounds produced in the endophytic fungus-grass association can provide grasses with resistance to herbivores resulting in mutualistic relationship between the fungus and the plant that has negative consequences for herbivorous insects. The horizontally transmitted nongrass type-II endophytes are far less well studied and as such their ecological roles are not fully understood. This forum article explores the intricacy of dependence in such complex triangular relationships drawing from well-established examples from the fungi that live as endophytes in vascular plants and how they impact on the biology and evolution of free-living as well as concealed (e. g., gall-inducing, gall-inhabiting) insects. Recent developments with the inoculation of strains of type-I fungal endophytes into grasses and their commercialization are discussed, along with the possible roles the endophytic fungi play in the galls induced by the Cecidomyiidae (Diptera).","Raman, A; Wheatley, W; Popay, A",NA,"","","Raman, A.; Wheatley, W.; Popay, A.",NA,"Endophytic Fungus-Vascular Plant-Insect Interactions","ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","Raman, Anantanarayanan/0000-0002-7293-7412; Popay, Alison/0000-0002-0201-5308",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0046-225X","1938-2936","",NA,NA,"JUN",2012,41,"3","","",NA,"433","447","","10.1603/EN11317","http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/EN11317","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,22732600,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000305475600004","View Full Record in Web of Science",411,NA

Endophytic fungi were isolated from Vochysia divergens root system, and molecular identification of fungi was performed by sequencing the ITS region. We selected and identified Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and Melanconiella elegans-21W2 for their ability to infect V. divergens root in vitro with development of typical dark septate fungi structures. Cowpea plants-inoculated or not inoculated with Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and M. elegans 21W2-were cultivated in 5-L pots under greenhouse conditions and submitted to four different electrical conductivities of irrigation water (1.2, 2.2, 3.6, and 5.0 dS m(-1)). The salinity caused decrease in leaf concentration of K and increased leaf concentration of calcium, sodium, and chlorine; and no influence of dark septate endophytic fungi was observed in these responses. On the other hand, root colonization with Sordariomycetes sp1-B'2 and M. elegans 21W2 resulted in improved nutrition with N and P in cowpea under salt stress, favoring the growth and rate of liquid photosynthesis.

Since endophytic fungi possess the natural capacity to produce the similar secondary metabolite to that of their host plants, they are promising as alternative sources of plant bioactive natural products. In this study, in order to search for SSd-producing strains, endophytes were isolated from B. scorzonerifolium and were authenticated by the ITS sequence and the translation elongation factor-1alpha gene (TEF-1 alpha) sequence analysis. The profile of metabolites present in the crude exacts was carried out by ultra performance liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF-MS) analysis. The results showed that two strains, CHS2 and CHS3 from B. scorzonerifolium could produce SSd by UPLC/Q-TOF-MS analysis, and the amount of SSd produced by strain CHS2 and CHS3 were about 2.17 and 2.40 mu g/mL, respectively. CHS2 and CHS3 showed a close phylogenetic relationship to Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium acuminatum, respectively. According to our concern, no endophytic fungi capable of producing SSd from B. scorzonerifolium have been found before.

"414","Presence","Plants cope with abiotic stress in several ways, including by collaborating with microorganisms. Epichloe, an endophytic fungus, has been shown to improve plant tolerance to extreme external environments. Hordeum bogdanii is a known salt-tolerant plant with the potential to improve alkaline lands. NHX1 plays a key role in the transport of ions in the cell and is overexpressed in plants with increased salt tolerance. However, the expression levels of HbNHX1 in Epichloe endophytic fungal symbionts in H. bogdanii have not been elucidated. We used Hordeum bogdanii (E+) with the endophytic fungi Epichloe bromicola and H. bogdanii (E-) without the endophytic fungi and compared the differences in the ion content and HbNHX1 expression between the shoots and roots of E+ and E- plants under alkaline stress. The absorption capacity of both K+ and Na+ of H. bogdanii with endophytic fungi was higher than that without endophytic fungi. In the absence of alkaline stress, endophytic fungi significantly reduced the Cl- content in the host H. bogdanii. Alkaline stress reduced SO42- content in H. bogdanii; however, compared with E-, endophytic fungi increased the content of SO42- in E+ plants. With an increase in the alkaline concentration, the expression of HbNHX1 in the roots of H. bogdanii with endophytic fungus exhibited an upward trend, whereas the expression in the shoots exhibited a downward trend first and then an upward trend. Under 100 mmol center dot L-1 mixed alkaline stress, the expression of HbNHX1 in E+ was significantly higher than that in E-, indicating that endophytic fungi could increase the Na+ region in vacuoles. The external environment affects the regulation of endophytic fungi in H. bogdanii and that endophytic fungi can play a key role in soil salinization. Therefore, the findings of this study will provide technical support and a theoretical basis for better utilization of endophytic fungi from H. bogdanii in saline land improvement.","Long, F; Hu, MF; Chen, S; Bao, GS; Dan, H; Chen, SH",NA,"","","Long, Feng; Hu, Meng-Fei; Chen, Sheng; Bao, Gen-Sheng; Dan, Han; Chen, Shui-Hong",NA,"Endophytic Fungi Regulate HbNHX1 Expression and Ion Balance in Hordeum bogdanii under Alkaline Stress","JOURNAL OF FUNGI","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Hu, Mengfei/ABG-3590-2020; Long, Feng/AAN-4694-2021","Hu, Mengfei/0000-0003-4272-144X;",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"","2309-608X","",NA,NA,"MAR",2023,9,"3","","",NA,"","","331","10.3390/jof9030331","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof9030331","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,36983499,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000958230700001","View Full Record in Web of Science",414,NA
"415","Presence","Background: Paclitaxel (Taxol (TM)) is an important anticancer drug with a unique mode of action. The biosynthesis of paclitaxel had been considered restricted to the Taxus species until it was discovered in Taxomyces andreanae, an endophytic fungus of T. brevifolia. Subsequently, paclitaxel was found in hazel (Corylus avellana L.) and in several other endophytic fungi. The distribution of paclitaxel in plants and endophytic fungi and the reported sequence homology of key genes in paclitaxel biosynthesis between plant and fungi species raises the question about whether the origin of this pathway in these two physically associated groups could have been facilitated by horizontal gene transfer. Results: The ability of the endophytic fungus of hazel Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 to independently synthesize paclitaxel was established by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance. The genome of Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 was sequenced and gene candidates that may be involved in paclitaxel biosynthesis were identified by comparison with the 13 known paclitaxel biosynthetic genes in Taxus. We found that paclitaxel biosynthetic gene candidates in P. aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431 have evolved independently and that horizontal gene transfer between this endophytic fungus and its plant host is unlikely. Conclusions: Our findings shed new light on how paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungi synthesize paclitaxel, and will facilitate metabolic engineering for the industrial production of paclitaxel from fungi.","Yang, YF; Zhao, HN; Barrero, RA; Zhang, BH; Sun, GL; Wilson, IW; Xie, FL; Walker, KD; Parks, JW; Bruce, R; Guo, GW; Chen, L; Zhang, Y; Huang, X; Tang, Q; Liu, HW; Bellgard, MI; Qiu, DY; Lai, JS; Hoffman, A",NA,"","","Yang, Yanfang; Zhao, Hainan; Barrero, Roberto A.; Zhang, Baohong; Sun, Guiling; Wilson, Iain W.; Xie, Fuliang; Walker, Kevin D.; Parks, Joshua W.; Bruce, Robert; Guo, Guangwu; Chen, Li; Zhang, Yong; Huang, Xin; Tang, Qi; Liu, Hongwei; Bellgard, Matthew I.; Qiu, Deyou; Lai, Jinsheng; Hoffman, Angela",NA,"Genome sequencing and analysis of the paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungus Penicillium aurantiogriseum NRRL 62431","BMC GENOMICS","",NA,NA,NA,"","","","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Wilson, Iain/D-4839-2009; Zhang, Yong/AAS-3454-2020; Zhang, Baohong/O-4948-2016","Wilson, Iain/0000-0002-4626-8059; Bellgard, Matthew/0000-0002-6303-9469; Zhang, Yong/0000-0002-2276-7187; Walker, Kevin/0000-0001-5208-6692; Barrero, Roberto/0000-0002-7735-665X; Tang, Qi/0000-0003-2385-4263",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1471-2164","","",NA,NA,"25-Jan",2014,15,"","","",NA,"","","69","10.1186/1471-2164-15-69","http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-15-69","","",NA,NA,NA,NA,24460898,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000332573300001","View Full Record in Web of Science",415,NA

Endophytic fungi were isolated from soybean leaves and initially screened on agar plates for the production of CMCase (carboxymethylcellulase), xylanase, amylase and protease. The highest Enzymatic Indexes (IE) were verified for xylanase (2.14 and 1.31) with the fungi M6-A6P5F2 and M12-A5P3F1.2 and CMCase (1.92 and 1.62) with the fungi M13-A9P2F1 and M12-A5P3F1.2, respectively. The production of xylanase and CMCase by the selected fungi was evaluated in submerged cultivation using beechwood xylan and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), as well as sugarcane straw and bagasse in different ratios as carbon sources. Both types of lignocellulosic biomass proved to be good inducers of enzymatic activity. The best xylanase producer among the isolates was identified as Colletotrichum boninense. With this fungus, the highest xylanase activity was obtained with a sugarcane straw-bagasse mixture in a 50:50 ratio (383.63 U mL(-1)), a result superior to that obtained with the use of beechwood xylan (296.65 U mL(-1)). Regardingthe kinetic behavior of the crude xylanase, there was found optimal pH of 5.0 and optimal temperatures of 50 degrees C and 60 degrees C. At 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C, xylanase retained 87% and 76% of its initial catalytic activity, respectively.

They therefore must obtain all of their nutrients from the apoplastic spaces in the plant. This report is the first comprehensive, biochemically based study of sugar uptake by Acremonium spp. The endophytes (Acremonium typhinum) were isolated from Festuca rubra plants and were grown in culture. Individual colonies were incubated in the presence of [U-C-14] radiolabeled glucose, fructose, or sucrose for 20 minutes and the uptake quantified by scintillation counting. The uptake rates for all three sugars were biphasic, indicating two distinct mechanisms of transport. At low sugar concentrations (below 10 mM) the uptake was saturable and had the characteristics of a carrier-mediated mechanism. At high sugar concentrations (10-100 mM) the uptake was linear suggesting diffusion as the predominant mechanism of uptake. From competition experiments (uptake of labeled sugar in the presence of a different unlabeled sugar) it appeared that there were separate carriers for glucose and fructose. Two mechanisms for sucrose uptake were detected, a sucrose carrier and hexose uptake as a result of cell wall invertase. Cell wall invertase activity of the fungal isolates was inducible by growing the fungi on sucrose containing media.","LAM, CK; BELANGER, FC; WHITE, JF; DAIE, J",NA,NA,NA,"LAM, CK; BELANGER, FC; WHITE, JF; DAIE, J",NA,"MECHANISM AND RATE OF SUGAR UPTAKE BY ACREMONIUM-TYPHINUM, AN ENDOPHYTIC FUNGUS INFECTING FESTUCA-RUBRA - EVIDENCE FOR PRESENCE OF A CELL-WALL INVERTASE IN ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI","MYCOLOGIA",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"White, James/C-2280-2009",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0027-5514",NA,NA,NA,NA,"MAY-JUN",1994,86,"3",NA,NA,NA,"408","415",NA,"10.2307/3760573","http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3760573",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1994NZ04600013",NA,3804,NA
"481","Presence","Many plant endophytes produce mycotoxins, but how host genetic variation influences endophyte colonization and mycotoxin production under natural conditions is poorly understood. This interaction has not been fully considered in many previous studies which used controlled experiments with agronomic or model plant species. Here, we investigated this interaction in a naturally occurring forb (a locoweed species) Oxytropis ochrocephala, its symbiotic endophyte Alternaria oxytropis, and the mycotoxin swainsonine. Host genetic variation was characterized by microsatellite markers. Endophyte infection rate and swainsonine levels were determined by PCR and HPLC, respectively. Genetic markers defined two distinct host populations and revealed that host genetics were significantly correlated with geographical location, elevation, and precipitation. As the host diverged, symbiotic interactions were reduced or failed to produce detectable swainsonine in one host population. Host genotype and precipitation had a significant impact in shaping swainsonine production at the population level. This study highlights the effect of host genotype in influencing this interaction in locoweeds.","He, W; Guo, LW; Wang, L; Zhao, QQ; Guo, LZ; Cao, W; Mur, LAJ; Wei, YH",NA,NA,NA,"He, Wei; Guo, Linwei; Wang, Lei; Zhao, Qianqian; Guo, Lizhu; Cao, Wei; Mur, Luis A.

"482","Presence","Microbial plant symbionts are widely spread in nature changing the way their hosts interact with their environment. Neotyphodium fungal endophytes (Clavicipitaceae) are grass symbionts known by their production of alkaloids, toxic for herbivores. Here, we hypothesized that endophytes confer associational protection to non-host plants and change emission of host volatile-compounds. In an outdoor mesocosm experiment, we examined aphid infestation on Trifolium repens plants, in response to Neotyphodium occultans presence in neighbouring Lolium multiflorum. Contrasting levels of Rhizobium were generated in T. repens plants considering that symbiosis with N-2-fixers would influence herbivore abundance. Aphid infestation increased responding to symbiotic status of T. repens plants, when surrounded by non-symbiotic L. multiflorum plants. Endophytes modified the volatile imprints of L. multiflorum plants measured by an electronic nose, suggesting a potential mechanism to benefit neighbours. This associational protection constitutes a new mutualism trait of grass-endophyte symbiosis, becoming a non-private benefit available to other community partners.

"483","Presence","Morphological and physiological responses to water deficit of two tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) cultivars were compared in a glasshouse experiment and the effect, on those responses, of artificial infection of the tall fescue plants with two fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum) strains was evaluated. The cultivars were Maris Kasba (MK), of Mediterranean origin, and El Palenque (EP), an Argentinian cultivar of temperate origin. The endophyte strains AgResearch isolate (AR501) and the Kentucky (KY31) wild type were compared with nil-endophyte controls. Leaf growth rare of EP plants under water deficit was higher and leaf senescence rate lower than for MK plants (P < 0.05). MK plants showed a greater increase in the proportion of dead leaf tissue than EP plants as water deficit increased (P < 0.05). Stomatal conductance and lamina osmotic adjustment at low soil moisture were lower for MK than EP (P < 0.05). Endophyte-infected plants had a lower dry weight and tiller number, but a higher net growth rate during water deficit treatments than endophyte-free plants (P < 0.05). A significant cultivar x endophyte interaction (P < 0.05) was observed for many variables studied. This implies that any new endophyte strain should be evaluated in combination with the plant genotypes with which it is likely to be associated in commercial practice.

Many vascular plants are able to form close symbiotic associations with endophytic fungi. Metarhizium is a common plant endophyte found in a large number of ecosystems. This abundant soil fungus is also a pathogen to a large number of insects, which are a source of nitrogen. It is possible that the endophytic capability and insect pathogenicity of Metarhizium are coupled to provide an active method of nitrogen transfer to plant hosts via fungal mycelia. We used soil microcosms to test the ability of M. robertsii to translocate insect-derived nitrogen to plants. Insects were injected with N-15-labeled nitrogen, and we tracked the incorporation of N-15 into amino acids in two plant species, haricot bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), in the presence of M. robertsii.

Diseases caused by Phyllosticta commonly include leaf and fruit spots that can affect economically important plants. The genus is characterized mainly by aseptate and hyaline conidia and ascospores. Its conidia are surrounded by a mucilaginous sheath, with a single mucoid apical appendage while ascospores exhibit a mucoid cap at both ends. Given that many Phyllosticta taxa are cryptic and share similar morphologies, it is arduous to depict taxonomically relevant characters solely on the basis of morphological or ecological features. Coupled with morphological description, multi -locus phylogenetic analyses of species comprising complexes are used to broadly describe this genus and understand species boundaries. Despite several published taxonomic revisions and enumerations of Phyllosticta species, there is still considerable confusion when identifying these taxa.

We found local adaptation across the European range, as evidenced by higher host fitness of the local geographic origin compared with nonlocals at three of the four studied sites, suggesting that selection pressures are driving evolution in different directions. Abiotic factors did not result in strong fitness effects related to Epichloe symbiosis, indicating that other factors such as herbivory are more likely to contribute to fitness differences between plants naturally occurring with or without Epichloe. Nevertheless, in the case of asymmetric symbiosis that is obligatory for the symbiont, abiotic conditions that affect performance of the host, may also cause selective pressure for the symbiont.","Leinonen, PH; Helander, M; Vazquez-de-Aldana, BR; Zabalgogeazcoa, I; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Leinonen, Paivi; Helander, Marjo; Vazquez-de-Aldana, Beatriz; Zabalgogeazcoa, Inigo; Saikkonen, Kari",NA,"Local adaptation in natural European host grass populations with asymmetric symbiosis","PLOS ONE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Zabalgogeazcoa, Inigo/F-9523-2016; Leinonen, Paivi/IWV-0880-2023; Vazquez-de-Aldana, Beatriz/A-7760-2008","Zabalgogeazcoa, Inigo/0000-0002-9524-7799; Leinonen, Paivi/0000-0003-0210-5589; Vazquez-de-Aldana, Beatriz/0000-0001-6549-3545; Saikkonen, Kari/0000-0001-5203-9984",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1932-6203",NA,NA,NA,NA,"APR 17",2019,14,"4",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1371/journal.pone.0215510","http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0215510",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,30995278,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000465010000058",NA,6523,NA

A total of 5,760,162 high-quality fungal sequences were recovered and assigned to 8,504 Operational Taxonomic Units. Members of the phylum Ascomycota were dominant in all samples and accounted for 91.6% of the total number of detected sequences. This was followed by Basidiomycota (8%), Chytridiomycota (0.1%), and unidentified fungi (0.3%). Alpha and beta diversity analyses revealed the presence of significantly different fungal populations in the investigated fruit parts. Among detected fungi, the genus Penicillium prevailed in the peel and in the wounded flesh while Alternaria spp. prevailed in the calyx and stem end samples that included apple core tissues. Several taxonomic units that appear to be closely related to pathogenic fungi associated with secondary human infections were present in peel and wounds. Moreover, significantly different populations were revealed in organic and conventional apples and this result was consistent in all investigated fruit parts (calyx end, peel, stem end, and wounded flesh). Several unique taxa were exclusively detected in organic apples suggesting that management practices may have been a contributing factor in determining the taxa present. In contrast, little differences were revealed in the two assessment times (T1 and T5). Results of the present study represent an advancement of the current knowledge on the fungal microbiota in collected fruit tissues of apple.","Abdelfattah, A; Wisniewski, M; Droby, S; Schena, L",NA,NA,NA,"Abdelfattah, Ahmed; Wisniewski, Michael; Droby, Samir; Schena, Leonardo",NA,"Spatial and compositional variation in the fungal communities of organic and conventionally grown apple fruit at the consumer point-of-purchase","HORTICULTURE RESEARCH",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Abdelfattah, Ahmed/P-1943-2015; Schena, Leonardo/A-7492-2018","Abdelfattah, Ahmed/0000-0001-6090-7200; Schena, Leonardo/0000-0002-9737-2593; Wisniewski, Michael/0000-0002-7481-5590",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2052-7276",NA,NA,NA,NA,"OCT 5",2016,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"10.1038/hortres.2016.47","http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/hortres.2016.47",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,27766161,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000385438800001",NA,7849,NA

"490","Presence","Understanding how species-rich communities persist is a foundational question in ecology. In tropical forests, tree diversity is structured by edaphic factors, climate, and biotic interactions, with seasonality playing an essential role at landscape scales: wetter and less seasonal forests typically harbor higher tree diversity than more seasonal forests. We posited that the abiotic factors shaping tree diversity extend to hyperdiverse symbionts in leaves-fungal endophytes-that influence plant health, function, and resilience to stress. Through surveys in forests across Panama that considered climate, seasonality, and covarying biotic factors, we demonstrate that endophyte richness varies negatively with temperature seasonality. Endophyte community structure and taxonomic composition reflect both temperature seasonality and climate (mean annual temperature and precipitation). Overall our findings highlight the vital role of climate-related factors in shaping the hyperdiversity of these important and little-known symbionts of the trees that, in turn, form the foundations of tropical forest biodiversity.","Oita, S; Ibáñez, A; Lutzoni, F; Miadlikowska, J; Geml, J; Lewis, LA; Hom, EFY; Carbone, I; U'Ren, JM; Arnold, AE",NA,NA,NA,"Oita, Shuzo; Ibanez, Alicia; Lutzoni, Francois; Miadlikowska, Jolanta; Geml, Jozsef; Lewis, Louise A.; Hom, Erik F.

"491","Other","A manipulative field study was carried out to determine whether the foliar endophyte fungus, Phialocephala scopiformis DAOM 229536, decreased the performance of eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana larvae developing on white spruce trees. Overwintered second-instar budworm larvae from a laboratory colony or from a wild population were placed on endophyte positive or negative trees one or two weeks before budburst. The presence of the endophyte in the needles reduced the survival of C. fumiferana from both a wild population and a laboratory colony. Survival for budworm juveniles up to pupation and to adult emergence was 13% and 17% lower, respectively, on endophyte positive trees. The endophyte did not influence the size or sex of survivors and budworm survival was not influenced by any two- or three-way interactions. Budworm survival was higher for wild than for laboratory-reared budworm and for budworm placed on trees a week before budburst. This may be the first field study to demonstrate the efficacy of an endophytic fungus against wild individuals of a major forest insect pest. The efficacy of the endophyte at low larval densities suggests that it could be a useful tactic to limit spruce budworm population growth in the context of an early intervention strategy.","Dan, QR; Adams, G; Flaherty, L; McCartney, A; Miller, JD; Edwards, S",NA,NA,NA,"Dan Quiring; Adams, Greg; Flaherty, Leah; McCartney, Andrew; Miller, J.

Each agroecosystem for their productions comes with a rich complex of insect and mite associates, most of which are not regarded as pests. However, a significant number of serious pests attack the leaves, roots, stems, and roots of each crop. The foliage of tea, the marketable part of the plant, is attacked by tortricid moths, hemipterans, and coleopterans. Although Bacillus thuringiensis is the most used microbial control agent of lepidopteran pests of tea, considerable research has been conducted on entomopathogenic viruses, mostly Baculoviruses, for their control and entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) as microbial control agents of hemipteran pests. Coffee plants are attacked by a broad range of insect and mite pests including coleopterans, lepidopterans, hemipterans, and mites. Among these, the coffee berry borer (CBB) is the most economically important pest of coffee worldwide. The EPF, Beauveria bassiana, has been used along with other interventions for its control in Colombia.

"495","Both","Cool-season grasses establish symbioses with vertically transmitted Neotyphodium endophytes widespread in nature. The frequency of endophyte-infected plants in closed populations (i.e., without migrations) depends on both the differential fitness between infected and non-infected plants, and the endophyte-transmission efficiency. Most studies have been focused on the first mechanism ignoring the second. Infection frequency and endophyte transmission from vegetative tissues to seeds were surveyed in two grasses growing in vegetation units that differ in flood and grazing regimes, and soil salinity. Transmission efficiency and infection frequency for tall fescue did not vary significantly and were 0.98 and 1.00, respectively. For Italian ryegrass, transmission efficiency and infection frequency were 0.88 and 0.57 in humid prairies, and 0.96 and 0.96 in the other vegetation units. Only in humid mesophytic meadows, the observed pattern was irrespective of the presence or absence of grazers. Our results suggest that selection forces for endophyte infection are different for both species. Imperfect transmission was only compensated in tall fescue through an increased fitness of infected plants. Interpreting variations of infection frequency only in terms of differential fitness can be misleading, considering that endophyte transmission can be imperfect and variable in nature. Therefore, this study highlights the importance of measuring transmission efficiency.","Gundel, PE; Garibaldi, LA; Tognetti, PM; Aragón, R; Ghersa, CM; Omacini, M",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro E.; Garibaldi, Lucas A.; Tognetti, Pedro M.; Aragon, Roxana; Ghersa, Claudio M.; Omacini, Marina",NA,"Imperfect Vertical Transmission of the Endophyte <i>Neotyphodium</i> in Exotic Grasses in Grasslands of the Flooding Pampa","MICROBIAL ECOLOGY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Tognetti, Pedro/AAF-7018-2019; Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013; Garibaldi, Lucas/D-7302-2013","Garibaldi, Lucas Alejandro/0000-0003-0725-4049; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Tognetti, Pedro M./0000-0001-7358-1334; Omacini, Marina/0000-0003-1460-262X",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0095-3628","1432-184X",NA,NA,NA,"MAY",2009,57,"4",NA,NA,NA,"740","748",NA,"10.1007/s00248-008-9447-y","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-008-9447-y",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,18797956,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000265044900015",NA,1911,NA

The mean infection of plant samples from 26 states was 58%; however, seed samples were less infected (54%), particularly when live endophyte was assayed (6%). The cultivar KY-31 was most heavily infected, although endophyte-free seed of this and other cultivars were common. Livestock owners reporting symptoms of fescue toxicity also reported higher levels of infection than owners not observing symptoms.","SHELBY, RA; DALRYMPLE, LW",NA,NA,NA,"SHELBY, RA; DALRYMPLE, LW",NA,"INCIDENCE AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE TALL FESCUE ENDOPHYTE IN THE UNITED-STATES","PLANT DISEASE",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0191-2917","1943-7692",NA,NA,NA,"SEP",1987,71,"9",NA,NA,NA,"783","786",NA,"10.1094/PD-71-0783","http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/PD-71-0783",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:A1987J809000003",NA,4892,NA
"497","Both","Pooideae grasses may be colonized by systemic fungal endophytes. The fitness of endophyte depends entirely on resources and seed transmission from the host plant, while colonized plants may gain increased survival, growth, and reproduction relative to their uncolonized conspecifics. Most research of endophyte-grass interactions have been carried out on few cultivars of tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix) and their symbiont Neotyphodium coenophialum. Lack of studies using wild populations of tall fescue across the species natural distribution range, however, limits the understanding of the ecological and evolutionary role of the symbiosis in nature. We performed a common garden experiment in Southern Finland with three wild, tall fescue populations from northern Europe and the forage cultivar Kentucky-31 (KY-31). For each population, we used naturally endophyte-colonized, naturally endophyte-colonized but endophyte removed (decolonized), and naturally uncolonized plants to separate effects due to the host genotype from the endophyte. We evaluated growth variables and survival in four environmental treatments of varying water and nutrients. Supply of water and nutrients increased plant biomass and reproductive effort in all populations. This effect was higher for KY-31 plants which produced on average 55 % more seeds than wild plants, indicating better adaptation to high resource environments. However, the higher incidence of Claviceps sp. and the low winter survival indicated KY-31 tall fescue is mal-adapted to Northern European conditions. Naturally colonized plants had greater plant biomass (a parts per thousand 12 %), reproductive effort (a parts per thousand 22 %) and seed mass (a parts per thousand 29 %) than naturally uncolonized and decolonized plants. Nonetheless, endophyte colonization did not affect plant survival, and the effects of endophyte colonization on tiller number, panicle/tiller ratio and Claviceps sp. incidence depended on the population origin. In the wild populations, endophyte removal only reduced the number of tillers (a parts per thousand 29 % lower), while the difference between naturally colonized and naturally uncolonized plants was not significant. Our results show that endophyte symbiont increases tall fescue performance in general, but the differences between wild populations and cultivars indicate adaptation to local habitats and agronomic management, respectively. The comparison of naturally endophyte-colonized and decolonized plants suggests certain plant genotype-endophyte combinations found within populations result from local selection pressures.","Gundel, PE; Helander, M; Casas, C; Hamilton, CE; Faeth, SH; Saikkonen, K",NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro E.; Helander, Marjo; Casas, Cecilia; Hamilton, Cyd E.; Faeth, Stanley H.; Saikkonen, Kari",NA,"<i>Neotyphodium</i> fungal endophyte in tall fescue (<i>Schedonorus phoenix</i>): a comparison of three Northern European wild populations and the cultivar Kentuky-31","FUNGAL DIVERSITY",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Gundel, Pedro/A-5314-2013","Casas, Cecilia/0000-0003-3538-6081; Gundel, Pedro Emilio/0000-0003-3246-0282; Hamilton, Cyd/0000-0002-6378-3407; Saikkonen, Kari/0000-0001-5203-9984; Helander, Marjo/0000-0002-9759-4321",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1560-2745","1878-9129",NA,NA,NA,"MAY",2013,60,"1",NA,"SI",NA,"15","24",NA,"10.1007/s13225-012-0173-x","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13225-012-0173-x",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000320112900003",NA,6376,NA
"498","Review","This chapter summarises research carried out on the biology, ecology and the impact of the holomorph Apiognonwnia quercina/Discula quercina in oak forests. The major life-history traits and aspects of the epidemiology (isolation, survival, reproduction, dispersal, host selectivity) and control of the oak anthracnose agent are elucidated. The role of weather patterns in disrupting the delicate interaction between the host tree and the microorganism is outlined. The evidence suggests that changes in the climate profoundly alter the plant-endophyte symbiosis, generating conflicts of interest between the partners in the interaction. When such competing interests arise, the survival and reproduction of one member of the interaction do not conform with that of the partner. The interaction becomes thus disadvantageous and harmful to one of the organisms and the symbiosis from mutualistic or neutral turns antagonistic. The fungal partner, which under normal conditions survives in quiescence, with a low biomass, resumes growth but now switches from a latent, asymptomatic occupier of inner oak tissues to an aggressive coloniser that sporulates profusely over the tree surface. The importance of investigating the functioning and the role of the plant-endophyte symbiosis in perennial host trees in natural forests is stressed.","Moricca, S; Ragazzi, A",NA,"Pirttila, AM; Frank, AC",NA,"Moricca, Salvatore; Ragazzi, Alessandro",NA,"The Holomorph <i>Apiognomonia quercina</i>/<i>Discula quercina</i> as a Pathogen/Endophyte in Oak","ENDOPHYTES OF FOREST TREE: BIOLOGY AND APPLICATIONS","Forestry Sciences",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"0924-5480","1875-1334","978-94-007-1598-1",NA,NA,NA,2011,80,NA,NA,NA,NA,"47","66",NA,"10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8_3","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8_3","10.1007/978-94-007-1599-8",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"WOS:000294391600003",NA,8663,NA
