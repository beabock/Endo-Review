6864,Report on Vincristine-Producing Endophytic Fungus Nigrospora zimmermanii from Leaves of Catharanthus roseus,"Vincristine is an anti-cancer compound and one of the most crucial vinca alkaloids produced by the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don. (Apocynaceae). This plant is home to hundreds of endophytic microbes, which produce a variety of bioactive secondary metabolites that are known for their medicinal properties. In this study, we focused on isolating an endophytic fungus that could increase the yield of vincristine under laboratory conditions as an alternative to plant-mediated extraction of vincristine. The endophytic fungus Nigrospora zimmermanii (Apiosporaceae) was isolated from Catharanthus roseus and it was found to be producing the anticancer compound vincristine. It was identified using high-performance thin-layer chromatography by matching the Rf value and spectral data with the vincristine standard and mass spectrometry data and the reference molecule from the PubChem database. The generation study of this microbe showed that the production of vincristine in the parent fungus was at its maximum, i.e., 5.344 mu g/mL, while it was slightly reduced in subsequent generations. A colonization study was also performed and it showed that the fungus N. zimmermanii was able to re-infect the plant Catharanthus roseus after 20 days of inoculation. The colonization study showed that N. zimmernanii could infect the plant after isolation. This method is an efficient and easy way to obtain a high yield of vincristine, as compared to plant-mediated production.","Birat, K; Binsuwaidan, R; Siddiqi, TO; Mir, SR; Alshammari, N; Adnan, M; Nazir, R; Ejaz, B; Malik, MQ; Dewangan, RP; Ashraf, SA; Panda, BP",METABOLITES,2022,10.3390/metabo12111119,0.951567395550325,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998510235172892,0.00148976482710789,0.999999999999987,1.27675647831893e-14,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6908,Antifungal polyketide derivatives from the endophytic fungus Aplosporella javeedii,Six new polyketides aplojaveediins A-F (1-6) were isolated from the endophytic fungus Aplosporella javeedii associated with the host plant Orychophragmus violaceus (Brassicaceae). The structures of the new metabolites were elucidated by analysis of their NMR and MS data. Compound 1 exhibited antifungal activity against the hyphae form of Candida albicans strain ATCC 24433 in the agar plate diffusion assay and the microbroth dilution assay. The kinetic of killing of C. albicans cells for compound 1 was considerably faster than that of the positive control hygromycin B.

8645,Assessment of Endophytic Fungal Community in Palm Leaves and Their Biocontrol Potential,"Microbial endophytes live asymptomatically within a host plant and contribute positively to its fitness. Endophytes associate ubiquitously with all plants examined so far and form an integral part of the host for processes such as nutrient uptake and stress response and traits like disease resistance. Well-characterized host-endophyte interaction models exist, but little is known about the microbiome of the monocot plant host, palm. In this study, we identified the endophytic fungal community associated with mule palm leaves with an objective to test their antagonist effects on lethal pathogens of palms. The leaflets of mule palms were sampled across five sites in Central and South Florida, and fungal endophytes were identified using culture-dependent (CD) and amplicon sequence-based culture-independent (CI) methods. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) corresponding to phylum Ascomycota were identified by both approaches, whereas Basidiomycota were only detected using the CI method. Among the ascomycetes, a small (22%) overlap in the OTUs at the genus level was observed between the two methods, whereas the majority (64%) of OTUs were detected using the CI approach. In vitro cocultivation of endophytes with palm pathogens was observed to produce three distinct interaction phenotypes: inhibition zone, niche establishment, and overlapping growth. Eight endophytes capable of inhibiting fungal pathogen growth in vitro were also identified, suggesting a biocontrol potential for endophyte-derived secondary metabolites. A better understanding of the composition, assembly, and ecology of palm-associated microbial communities would eventually lead to healthy and resilient palms.Copyright (c) 2024 The Author(s).

13515,Tasco-Forage: I. Influence of a seaweed extract on antioxidant activity in tall fescue and in ruminants,"Seaweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) is a known source of plant growth regulators, and application to turfgrasses has increased activity of the antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) and specific vitamin precursors. Increased antioxidant activity in both plants and animals diminishes oxidative stress. Two pasture experiments investigated effects of Tasco-Forage (a proprietary seaweed-based product) applied to tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) on antioxidant activity in plants and in ruminants that grazed the forage. In Exp. 1, fescue was 70 to 100% infected with the endophyte fungus Neotyphodium coenophialum ([Morgan-Jones and Gams] Glenn, Bacon, and Hanlin). Twenty-four wether lambs (initial BW 41 kg; SD = 5) grazed fescue treated with 0, 1.7, or 3.4 kg Tasco/ha applied in April and July, 1994, with four replications per treatment. Grazing occurred for 26 d beginning April 21 and for 22 d beginning July 19. In July, there was a linear increase in daily gains (P < 0.05), and serum vitamin A (P < 0.13) and whole-blood Se (P < 0.10) tended to increase in lambs grazing Tasco-treated fescue. In Exp. 2,48 Angus and Angus x Hereford steers (initial BW 245 kg; SD = 20) grazed infected or uninfected tall fescue in Virginia that was treated (3.4 kg/ ha) or untreated with Tasco in April and July, 1995. Steers that grazed infected tall fescue had lower (P < 0.02) serum vitamin A and E and tended (P < 0.07) to have lower whole-blood Se in September compared with steers that grazed uninfected tall fescue. Tasco decreased (P < 0.06) serum vitamin E but tended to increase whole-blood Se (P < 0.10) in September and serum vitamin A in July (P < 0.12). During 1996 and 1997, the experiment was repeated in Virginia with Angus steers and was replicated at Prairie, MS, where 1/4 Brahman x 3/4 Angus steers were used. Forty-eight steers were included at each location in each year (n = 192 total steers for 1996 and 1997). Steers that grazed infected tall fescue in Mississippi had lower (P < 0.05) serum vitamin E by the end of the grazing season. At both locations Tasco increased (P < 0.05) activity of superoxide dismutase in both infected and uninfected fescue. The endophyte in tall fescue seemed to decrease antioxidant activity in grazing steers, whereas Tasco seemed to increase antioxidant activity in both the forage and the grazing ruminant. Tasco may provide opportunities to reduce oxidative stress in plants and animals.",Fike J.H.; Allen V.G.; Schmidt R.E.; Zhang X.; Fontenot J.P.; Bagley C.P.; Ivy R.L.; Evans R.R.; Coelho R.W.; Wester D.B.,Journal of Animal Science,2001,10.2527/2001.7941011x,0.958809930473747,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.988852013917512,0.011147986082488,0.999999999948584,5.1415982582625494e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

2141,Forest and Plantation Soil Microbiomes Differ in Their Capacity to Suppress Feedback Between Geosmithia morbida and Rhizosphere Pathogens of Juglans nigra Seedlings,"Thousand cankers disease (TCD) is hypothesized to have a greater impact on eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) in urban forests and plantations compared with natural forest stands. Along with other factors such as resource availability, the phytobiome could partly account for observed differences in disease severity across management regimes. We investigated the extent to which J. nigra-associated soil microbiomes from plantations and natural forests modulate (i) the amount of necrosis caused by Geosmithia morbida in 1-year-old seedlings, and (ii) relative abundance of rhizosphere endophytes and opportunistic pathogens Fusarium and Rhizoctonia in response to aboveground inoculation with G. morbida. Our results suggest that the microbiome from natural forest soil in central Indiana suppresses Fusarium spp. and is indirectly suppressive of G. morbida. Natural forest soil had a greater ability to reduce the size of necrotic area caused by G. morbida compared with steam-treated soil. Inoculating stems of seedlings with G. morbida induced a shift in fungal community composition in the rhizosphere, including Fusarium and Rhizoctonia spp.; however, the direction and magnitude of the shift depended on whether seedlings were amended with forest, plantation, or steam-treated soil. In a companion experiment, necrotic area in G. morbida-inoculated seedlings was twice as high in seedlings grown from seeds that were treated with Fusarium solani relative to those grown from seed treated with water. Our findings support the hypothesis that TCD seventy can be modulated by host-mediated feedback between above- and belowground pathogens, as well as by microbial interactions in the rhizosphere.","Williams, GM; Ginzel, MD",PHYTOBIOMES JOURNAL,2022,10.1094/PBIOMES-02-21-0014-R,0.991923153194745,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996398663741992,0.00360133625800784,0.999999999907228,9.277245638372729e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
928,"Inference in incidence, infection, and impact: Co-infection of multiple hosts by multiple pathogens","A large literature concerns the epidemiology of single pathogens on single hosts. Yet in some environmental applications,such as fungal pathogens of forest tree seedlings,the ""one host-one pathogen"" paradigm may not be applicable. Multiple potential pathogens are often found in a single individual and/or multiple hosts share the same pathogens. Understanding diversity requires techniques to infer how multiple pathogens might regulate multiple hosts and to predict how imp acts might vary with the environment. Here we present a hierarchical framework for the case where there is detection information based on multiple sources(cultures, gene sequencing,and survival observations),and the inference problem includes not only parameters that describe environmental influences on pathogen incidence infection, and host survival, but also on latent states themselves-pathogen incidence at a site and infection statuses of hosts. Due to the large size of the model space, we develop a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to select models, estimate posterior distributions, and predict environmental influences on host survival. we demonstrate with application to a data set involving fungal pathogens on tree hosts,where data include host survival and fungal detection using cultures and DNA sequencing.","Clark, JS; Hersh, MH",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,2009,10.1214/09-BA413,0.992397483632286,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998531962105262,0.00146803789473813,0.999999991065381,8.93461860052014e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

4021,"ENDOPHYTIC LEPTOSTROMA SPECIES ON PICEA-ABIES, ABIES-ALBA, AND ABIES-BALSAMEA - A CULTURAL, BIOCHEMICAL, AND NUMERICAL STUDY","Growth on different media, substrate utilization patterns, water-soluble protein electrophoretic profiles, as well as pectinase and amylase multilocus enzyme analyses were used to characterize thirty-seven endophytic strains of Leptostroma isolated from needles of Picea abies, Abies alba, and A. balsamea. Among substrate utilization tests, only proteolytic activity, almost absent in the spruce isolates but usually present in the others, could be used for characterization of strains. All isolates tested positive for the Bavendamm reaction and were able to utilize soluble starch and cellulose. Electrophoresis of water soluble proteins provided a reliable method to distinguish isolates from different hosts because electromorphs were host-specific. Electrophoresis of pectic enzymes allowed a more accurate differentiation of strains within host, but, on the whole, host-specificity of electromorphs was confirmed. Amylolytic activity was absent in ca 50% of the strains tested and the same electromorph was shared by roughly 80% of the remaining isolates. The results of this study support the hypothesis that distinct species of Leptostroma, which are morphologically almost indistinguishable from each other, colonize apparently healthy needles of A. alba, A. balsamea, and P. abies. Ecophysiologically all isolates showed biochemical attributes associated with needle penetration and long-term residence within needles.","SIEBERCANAVESI, F; PETRINI, O; SIEBER, TN",MYCOLOGIA,1991,10.2307/3759835,0.884056937569288,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99902572433424,9.7427566576047e-4,0.999983817843797,1.61821562028042e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
7645,Isolation and Characterization of Antibacterial Compounds from Aspergillus fumigatus: An Endophytic Fungus from a Mangrove Plant of the Sundarbans,"The Sundarbans, a UNESCO world heritage site, is one of the largest mangrove forests in one stretch. Mangrove plants from this forest are little studied for their endophytic fungi. In this study, we isolated fourteen endophytic fungi from the plants Ceriops decandra and Avicennia officinalis collected from the Sundarbans. Five of them were identified as Aspergillus sp. and one as Penicillium sp. by macroscopic and microscopic observation. Antibacterial activity of the crude extracts obtained from these endophytes was determined against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using resazurin-based microtiter assay. The isolated endophytes showed varying degrees of antibacterial activity with MICs ranging between 5 and 0.078 mg/mL. Molecular identification of the most active endophyte revealed its identity as Aspergillus fumigatus obtained from the leaves of C. decandra. Acute toxicity study of the ethyl acetate extract of A. fumigatus in mice revealed no mortality even at the highest dose of 2000 mg/kg bodyweight, though some opposing results are found in the subacute toxicity study. The extract was subjected to silica gel and Sephadex column chromatography resulting in the isolation of three pure compounds. LC-MS analysis of these pure compounds revealed their identity as fumigaclavine C, azaspirofuran B, and fraxetin. This is the first report of fraxetin from A. fumigatus. All three identified compounds were previously reported for their antibacterial activity against different strains of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Therefore, the observed antibacterial activity of the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract of A. fumigatus could be due to the presence of these compounds. These results support the notion of investigating fungal endophytes from the Sundarbans for new antimicrobial compounds.","Zihad, SMNK; Hasan, MT; Sultana, MS; Nath, S; Nahar, L; Rashid, MA; Uddin, SJ; Sarker, SD; Shilpi, JA",EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE,2022,10.1155/2022/9600079,0.97851846628644,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.965038135907791,0.0349618640922087,0.999999946515927,5.34840729482511e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

15229,Plant Seedling Growth Stimulation and Antifungal Activities of Volatile Organic Compounds Emitted by Aspergillus flavus Endophyte,"Introduction: Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) produced by Plant Growth Promoting fungi (PGPF) have recently been investigated due to their role in plant growth promotion and defense. Whereas many VOCs produced by PGPF promote seed growth. It is known that VOCs, among several other mechanisms, are responsible for the antagonistic activity produced by microorganisms. In this study, we focused on a comparative study between the VOCs emitted by the endophyte A. flavus AFEG-2017 and its host plant (Eleocharis geniculata) and the role of these VOCs in the growth promotion and biological control of some economic plants. Materials and Methods: VOCs from AFEG-2017 and E. geniculata were extracted using ethyl acetate. Then, the analysis of emitted VOCs was accomplished by using gas chromatography mass (GC-MS). Seedling stimulation assay was investigated on seeds of Trigonella foenum-graecum, Solanum lycopersicum, Portulaca oleracea, and Lepidium sativum. In addition, the antifungal activity of VOCs was evaluated against some plant pathogenic fungi. Results: The GC-MS analysis of the volatile emitted from A. flavus (AFEG-2017) resulted in 25 organic and bioactive compounds; of them 2-(2-hydroxy-3-isobutoxypropyl) pent-4-enoic acid, hydrazide was the most abundant compound. The findings of the present study advocate that linalool, linalyl acetate, geranyl acetate, oleic acid, 1-eicosanol, and 1-chloro-octadecane are suitable as biocontrol agents against phytopathogenic fungi. In addition, the volatiles of Euphorbia geniculata showed 28 bioactive compounds, in which Phytol was the most abundant one. The VOCs produced by AFEG-2017 enhanced the seedling growth of T. foenum-graecum, S. lycopersicum, P. oleracea, and L. sativum. Also, VOCS showed inhibition in the tested pathogenic fungi growth like Fusarium oxysporum which showed the highest inhibition percentage in the growth (40%). Conclusions: This study proved that there is a harmony between VOCs produced by the medicinal plant E. geniculata and its endophyte A. flavus. These volatiles could successfully accelerate plant seeding and limit the growth of some important phytopathogens. © 2022 The Author(s).",Abdel-Motaal F.F.; Kamel N.M.; El-Zayat S.A.; Mohamed A.E.-H.H.; Darwish D.B.,Journal of Applied Biotechnology Reports,2022,10.30491/JABR.2022.335430.1514,0.739800385389924,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997287057358239,0.00271294264176125,0.999999995514124,4.48587567092318e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
9620,Increased populations of deleterious fluorescent pseudomonads colonizing rhizomes of leatherleaf fern (Rumohra adiantiformis) and expression of symptoms of fern distortion syndrome after application of Ben late systemic fungicide,"The overall objective of the current study was to test two hypotheses: (1) application of the systemic fungicide Benlate to leatherleaf fern results in long-term increases in populations of deleterious fluorescent pseudomonads that endophytically colonize rhizomes; (2) such endophytic colonization, resulting from Benlate treatment, is associated with damage to leatherleaf fern and development of symptoms of fern distortion syndrome (FDS). Mean populations of fluorescent pseudomonads and total aerobic bacteria in the rhizosphere were significantly increased 3 months after the application of Benlate 50 WP and Benlate 50 DF as foliar sprays and drenches, compared to populations in the non-treated control. In another test, at 5 months after treatment, endophytic populations of fluorescent pseudomonads inside rhizomes of plants treated with Benlate 50 WP and Benlate 50 DF (both from DuPont) were significantly higher than populations in rhizomes of plants treated with three different generic sources of Benlate 50 WP, the active ingredient benomyl, and MBC. In the same test, treatments with the two DuPont sources of Benlate, but not the generic sources, benomyl, or MBC resulted in reduced overall growth of plants, including reductions weight of fronds, roots and rhizomes and caliper of rhizomes. Three long-term experiments examined the effect of Benlate 50 WP and Benlate 50 DF on populations of fluorescent pseudomonads and development of distortions of frond growth and other symptoms associated with FDS. In two tests at 24 months after application, treatment with both formulations of Benlate increased endophytic populations of fluorescent pseudomonads inside rhizomes, compared to controls, in both experiments, and endophytic populations inside petioles of fronds arising from rhizomes were significantly greater with both Benlate treatments in one test where this parameter was measured. Also at 24 months after application, the Benlate treatments were associated with significant increases in severity of FDS, using a previously reported rating scale and by measuring several other parameters associated with FDS. In the third long-term test, the first crop of fronds was cut 24 months after treatment. Four weeks later, the numbers of actively growing rhizomes (that had produced new fronds) were significantly reduced on Benlate-treated plants, compared to the controls. At 6 months after cutting (30 months after Benlate treatments), weights of fronds were lower on Benlate-treated plants than on controls. Characterization of fluorescent pseudomonads isolated from inside rhizomes and petioles at 24 months after treatment revealed that applications of Benlate resulted in a marked increase in pectinolytic activity. DNA sequencing of 150 strains of fluorescent pseudomonads from inside rhizomes and 60 from inside petioles at 24 months after application of Benlate indicated low matches to type strains in the ribosomal data base. Phylogenetic characterization of the strains indicated the existence of 10 clusters. Pronounced shifts in frequency of strains in the various clusters were noted with Benlate treatment: over 70% of strains from rhizomes of Benlate-treated plants belonged to cluster E3, compared to only 2% of the strains from control rhizomes, and 98% of the control strains belonged to clusters C, D2, F. and G, while none of the strains from petioles or rhizomes of Benlate-treated plants belonged to these four clusters. In summary, treatment of leatherleaf fern with Benlate 50 WP and Benlate 50 DF from DuPont led to a progression of long-term deleterious effects on leatherleaf fern that were associated with increased populations of fluorescent pseudomonads that were functionally and phylogenetically different from pseudomonads from control plants.

13161,Endophytic and entomopathogenic strains of Beauveria sp to control the bovine tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus.,"Pathogenicity of strains of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana and endophytic strains of Beauveria sp against the bovine tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus was tested in laboratory bioassays and under field conditions. Suspensions containing 10(5), 10(7) and 10(9) conidia/mL were prepared of each fungal strain for laboratory bioassays. The ticks were maintained at 28 degrees C, 90 +/- 5% relative humidity, and the following variables were evaluated: initial female weight, egg weight, hatching percentage, reproductive efficiency, and percentage control. For tests under field conditions, a Beauveria suspension containing 10(6) conidia/mL was sprayed on tick-infested cows. After 72 h, the ticks were collected to estimate mortality under field conditions. Laboratory bioassays showed a mortality of 20 to 50% of the ticks seven days after inoculation with 10(7) Beauveria conidia/mL. Under field conditions 10(6) Beauveria conidia/mL induced 18-32% mortality. All Beauveria strains were effective in biological control of R.

2861,Performance of the biocontrol fungus Piriformospora indica on wheat under greenhouse and field conditions,"The endophyte Piriformospora indica colonizes roots of a range of host plants and increases biomass production and resistance to fungal pathogens and, thus has been considered a biocontrol fungus. However, the field performance of this fungus has not yet been tested in temperate climates. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of this fungus in different substrata under greenhouse and practical field conditions. Roots of winter wheat were colonized efficiently, and biomass was particularly increased on poor substrata. In greenhouse experiments, symptom severity of a typical leaf (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici), stem base (Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides), and root (Fusarium culmorum) pathogen was reduced significantly. However, in field experiments, symptoms caused by the leaf pathogen did not differ in Piriformospora indica-colonized compared with control plants. In the field, Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides disease severity was significantly reduced in plants colonized by the endophyte. Increased numbers of sheath layers and hydrogen peroxide concentrations after B. graminis attack were detected in Piriformospora indica-colonized plants, suggesting that root colonization causes induction of systemic resistance or priming of the host plant. Although the endophyte is not well suited for growth at Central European temperature conditions, it remains to be shown whether P. indica is more suitable for tropical or subtropical farming.","Serfling, A; Wirsel, SGR; Lind, V; Deising, HB",PHYTOPATHOLOGY,2007,10.1094/PHYTO-97-4-0523,0.955356908416984,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998478366248303,0.00152163375169695,0.999999999678625,3.21375259737522e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
17754,Protection to Tomato Wilt Disease Conferred by the Nonpathogen Fusarium oxysporum Fo47 is More Effective Than that Conferred by Avirulent Strains.,"Although the vascular pathogen Fusarium oxysporum is notorious for being the causal agent of Fusarium wilt disease, the vast majority of F. oxysporum strains are harmless soil and root colonizers. The latter F. oxysporum's are often endophytes colonizing roots intracellularly without negatively affecting plant fitness. Actually, most of them, like Fo47, are beneficial providing biological control to various root pathogens. Interestingly, also pathogenic F. oxysporum inoculated on a resistant host (i.e., avirulent F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici) can reduce susceptibility to virulent F. oxysporum strains via a mechanism called ""cross protection."" It has been hypothesized that cross protection is based on activation of a resistance protein of the host upon recognition of a cognate avirulence (Avr) protein of the pathogen. Currently, it is unknown whether the biocontrol activity of F. oxysporum endophytes utilizes similar mechanisms as cross protection conferred by avirulent pathogens, and whether both provide a quantitative similar level of protection. Here, we show that in tomato biocontrol activity of the Fo47 endophyte to the pathogen F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici is more effective than cross protection induced by avirulent F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici strains activating either I, I-2, or both resistance proteins upon recognition of Avr1 or the Avr2/Six5 pair, respectively. These findings imply that cross protection and biological control utilize different mechanisms to reduce susceptibility of the host to subsequent infections.",de Lamo FJ; Spijkers SB; Takken FLW,Phytopathology,2021,10.1094/PHYTO-04-20-0133-R,0.70300407784713,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.755428506911511,0.244571493088489,0.999965718785546,3.4281214454257e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
15338,Estimation of metabolic activity of cut flowers during a study to enhance vase life of Cymbidium hybrid cut-flowers,"In this study, the metabolic activity (MA) of orchid cut flowers was estimated by the modified alkali trap method for the first time, when an approach was made to increase the vase life of Cymbidium miniature hybrid and Cymbidium hybrid ‘H. C. Aurora’ cut flowers. Metabolic inhibitors like-systemic fungicides (Carbendazim and Metalaxyl) and darkness were used to increase the vase life of the cut flowers. Cut flowers kept with metabolic inhibitors had significantly higher relative fresh weight (RFW), rate of vase solution uptake (RVSU) and significantly lower MA compared to control, which consequently increased the vase life of the cut flowers. The vase life was maximum under Carbendazim + darkness treatment (C200 + D), followed by Carbendazim (C200)> Metalaxyl +Darkness (M200 + D)> Metalaxyl (M200)> Distilled water + Darkness (D)> Control, whereas the MA was maximum under the Control treatment, followed by D > M200 > M200 + D > C200 > C200 + D treatments for both the cut flowers. The C200 + D treatment increased the vase life by ∼31 and 27% for Cymbidium miniature hybrid and Cymbidium hybrid ‘H. C. Aurora’, respectively, compared to the control treatment. It can be inferred that Carbendazim+ darkness treatment can increase the vase life of orchid cut flowers and the modified alkali trap method would be effective for estimation of MA of the cut flowers. © 2022 SAAB",Biswas S.S.; Kalaivanan N.S.; Pal R.,South African Journal of Botany,2022,10.1016/j.sajb.2022.02.001,0.975502425496504,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Absence,0.214386080665491,0.785613919334509,0.999987727215644,1.22727843558934e-5,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
13883,Evaluation of systemic fungicides for use in the glasshouse industry,"The primary evaluation of ten fungicides for the control of cucumber powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca fuliginea), tomato leaf mould (Cladosporium fulvum) and tomato grey mould (Botrytis cinerea) indicated that nine of them were systemically active against one or more of the pathogens when applied as soil drenches. Benomyl, thiophanate, thiophanate‐methyl, thiabendazole and Cela W52A showed activity against all three diseases, but dimethirimol, triarimol and dodemorph were more specific and mainly active against cucumber powdery mildew. An in vitro bioassay generally indicated that fungitoxicity was not translocated from sprayed to unsprayed leaves, and though toxicity to B. cinerea, following soil drenches of benomyl, thiophanate and thiophanate‐methyl, was detected by bioassay in leaf sap and calyces it was not detected in fruit. Furthermore, extended evaluation of benomyl for the control of grey mould on cropping tomotoes showed that in the presence of abundant B. cinerea inoculum, benomyl soil drench treatment effectively controlled flower and leaf infection but not fruit ghost‐spotting.

7899,Towards the improvement of Eucalyptus globulus chemical and mechanical pulping using endophytic fungi,"Five endophytic fungal strains isolated from Eucalyptus sp. and capable of producing laccase (Neofusicoccum luteum, Ulocladium sp., Pringsheimia smilacis, Hormonema sp., and Neofusicoccum australe) were used to pre-treat Eucalyptus globulus wood chips. After the fungal pre-treatment, chips were submitted to kraft or mechanical pulping. All the endophytic fungal strains provided higher delignification during kraft pulping than control sample. The highest increase was achieved by Hormonema sp. (26.7%), which also reduced the NaOH consumption by 11.6% and increased mechanical strength (increases in tensile, tear and burst indices of 28.4%, 15.6% and 43.9%, respectively). Regarding mechanical pulping, only N. australe was able to reduce the energy consumed during the process (8.4%). However, all pulps from fungal pre-treated chips showed higher refining degree and mechanical properties than the control pulp, which would probably allow a lower consumption of energy during mechanical pulping to achieve a specific refining degree. The best mechanical properties and the lowest kappa number were also found when Hormonema sp. was applied. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Several authors have reported the presence of endophytic fungi from the medicinal plant Maytenus ilicifolia (""espinheira-santa"") in Brazil that has antimicrobial activity against various pathogens. Therefore, Colletotrichum strains were isolated from M. ilicifolia and identified based on morphology, RAPD markers, sequence data of the internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS-1 and ITS-2), the 5.8S gene, and species-specific PCR. The analyses suggested the presence of 2 species, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Colletotrichum boninense. Two morphological markers were characterized to allow C. gloeosporioides and C. boninense to be distinguished quickly and accurately.

19389,Endophytes and their potential in biotic stress management and crop production.,"Biotic stress is caused by harmful microbes that prevent plants from growing normally and also having numerous negative effects on agriculture crops globally. Many biotic factors such as bacteria, fungi, virus, weeds, insects, and nematodes are the major constrains of stress that tends to increase the reactive oxygen species that affect the physiological and molecular functioning of plants and also led to the decrease in crop productivity. Bacterial and fungal endophytes are the solution to overcome the tasks faced with conventional farming, and these are environment friendly microbial commodities that colonize in plant tissues without causing any damage. Endophytes play an important role in host fitness, uptake of nutrients, synthesis of phytohormone and diminish the injury triggered by pathogens via antibiosis, production of lytic enzymes, secondary metabolites, and hormone activation. They are also reported to help plants in coping with biotic stress, improving crops and soil health, respectively. Therefore, usage of endophytes as biofertilizers and biocontrol agent have developed an eco-friendly substitute to destructive chemicals for plant development and also in mitigation of biotic stress. Thus, this review highlighted the potential role of endophytes as biofertilizers, biocontrol agent, and in mitigation of biotic stress for maintenance of plant development and soil health for sustainable agriculture.",Chaudhary P; Agri U; Chaudhary A; Kumar A; Kumar G,Frontiers in microbiology,2022,10.3389/fmicb.2022.933017,0.897627875296325,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Absence,0.174270185888817,0.825729814111183,0.999515224196459,4.84775803541e-4,Absence,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Presence,Absence

15251,Effects of Organic Management Mode on Soil Fungal Community Structure and Functions in Tea Gardens; [有机管理模式对茶园土壤真菌群落结构及功能的影响],"To study the soil fungal community compositions and functional groups under different management practices and slope positions, soil samples derived from the topsoil (0-20 cm) were collected from the upper, middle, and lower slope positions of conventional and organic tea gardens. High-throughput sequencing, functional predictions and the molecular ecological network analysis were performed to investigate the community structures, functional groups and ecological network of soil fungi, respectively. The two-way ANOVA including management practices and slope positions showed that the two-way interaction had no effect on the soil fungal community α-diversity. Regardless of the management practices and the slope positions, the predominant fungal phyla were Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota. Management practices did not change the compositions of dominant fungal species, but affected their relative abundance. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) shows that the soil fungal community structures differed significantly among different management practices. The community structures of soil fungi at different slope positions were noticeably different under the conventional planting pattern (P<0.05), but were similar under the organic planting pattern (P>0.05). The linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis shows that 37 biomarkers were very sensitive to the changes in the management, with different management practices enriching for different fungal populations. The numbers of degree, clustering, edges, degree centrality and closeness centrality of the fungal interaction network under the organic planting pattern were all higher than those under the conventional planting pattern, indicating that the fungal networks were more complex in the organic tea garden. Saprotrophic fungi were the dominant fungal group across all tea gardens (66.67%~70.18%). The effects of the management practices on soil fungal functions were obvious. Compared to those under the conventional planting pattern, the average abundance of endophyte-litter saprotroph-soil saprotroph, wood saprotroph and animal pathogen-endophyte-plant pathogen-undefined saprotroph significantly increased, but the average abundance of undefined saprotroph, plant pathogen and animal pathogen-plant pathogen-undefined saprotroph remarkably decreased. The spearman correlation analysis and the redundancy analysis (RDA) show that soil total phosphorus, available phosphorus, total potassium, organic matter, cation exchange capacity and pH were the main factors affecting the abundance and diversity of the soil fungal community. Organic planting drastically changes the structure and the compositions of the soil fungal community, enhances fungal network complexity and stability, and thus is beneficial to maintain the sustainable ecosystem in tea garden soil. © 2019 Editorial Office of Journal of Tea science.

1267,Management practice and soil properties affect plant productivity and root biomass in endophyte-symbiotic and endophyte-free meadow fescue grasses,"IntroductionPesticides are increasingly used in intensely managed agro-environments, with an increasingly acknowledged impact on crop production, root establishment and plant resilience. At the same time management practices are intensified with the goal to maximize productivity.Materials and MethodsIn a greenhouse, we studied the effects of three mowing regimes (uncut, and cutting 5 or 15 cm) employed three times during the season on root and shoot biomass and chlorophyll content of the cool-season grass Festuca pratensis (meadow fescue) growing in soil with a history of glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) use, the corresponding control soil, and sterilized control soil. Half of the plants hosted a systemic and vertically transmitted fungal endophyte, Epichlo & euml; uncinata, which is known to promote host grass growth.ResultsEndophyte symbiosis did not affect any tested plant parameters. Cutting the plants to 5 cm decreased both root and cumulative shoot biomass. Herbicide soil history, together with intense cutting (5 cm), caused a decrease in shoot biomass and lowered the chlorophyll content. Surprisingly, soil sterilization boosted shoot biomass and chlorophyll concentrations during less intense cutting (15 cm) and noncutting when compared to the control soil. Root biomass reduced in uncut plants when growing in soil with a history of glyphosate use.ConclusionOur results indicate that GBH residues in the soil can diminish shoot biomass when grass is frequently cut. Decreased root biomass caused by soil glyphosate history goes together with a reduction of carbon allocation belowground, which decreases grassland resilience to climate warming, increasingly occurring droughts and extreme weather events. Mowing practices can determine the biomass of grasses above and below ground. Interactions with additional stressors, such as long-term herbicide use, inhibits plant biomass productivity above and below ground, which counteracts sustainable development goals in agricultural practices. image","Keronen, S; Helander, M; Saikkonen, K; Fuchs, B",JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT,2023,10.1002/sae2.12035,0.900098658947074,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998498779537462,0.00150122046253801,0.999999999988458,1.15415454970957e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

6800,Characterisation and dynamics of the fungal communities of Avena fatua and Echinochloa crus-galli seeds in soil seed bank,"Survival in the soil seed bank is critical to a weed maintaining populations in arable lands. The role of the seed-borne fungi in seed decay or survival needs to be determined to find solutions for reducing the weed seed banks in environmentally friendly ways. In this study, changes of the fungal microbiome after seed burial were determined in two economically important weed species, wild oat and barnyard grass. Seeds collected in different populations were buried in two sites and exhumed at intervals over the period of 1.5 years to test the seed fate. Epiphytic and endophytic fungal microbiota of seeds was characterised using both culture-based approach and NGS of ITS1 region. The proportion of visually intact seeds and decayed seeds was different between the two burial sites. The observed species richness of the isolated epiphytic fungi was higher in the fresh compared to the buried seeds. Fungal taxa determined by NGS amplicon sequencing only partly coincided with the isolated fungi, revealing higher diversity in buried seeds. The dynamic of taxonomic structure of the fungal community was less pronounced in wild oat seeds compared to the barnyard grass seeds, where both endophytic and epiphytic communities were significantly different in the buried seeds and differed between the burial sites. It can be concluded that the epiphytic fungal communities change after seed burial in both plant species, while endophytic communities are more stable in the intact seeds and changes of the fungal community in the seed endosphere may be associated with seed decay.","Necajeva, J; Boroduske, A; Nikolajeva, V; Senkovs, M; Fiipovics, M; Jakobija, I; Kalnina, I; Roga, A; Skinderskis, E; Gudra, D; Fridmanis, D",WEED RESEARCH,2024,10.1111/wre.12651,0.983127064641072,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.95074937760861,0.0492506223913896,0.99999853451324,1.46548675994396e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
13141,Laboratory evaluation of grain protectant efficacy of different foliar extracts against maize weevil - Sitophilus zeamais (Motschulsky),"The present study was aimed to evaluate six indigenous plant extracts for their ability to protect maize from infestation by maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais (M). The plant extracts were tested for its toxicity by fumigation and grain surface coating methods. Further, the effects of botanical treatments on F1 progeny, seed emergence and antifungal activities were studied. The results indicated that the extracts of Eicchornia crassipes controlled the test insect in grain surface coating method (100%, P = 0.05). Further, the same plant extract had significantly reduced the development of F1 progeny (97 ± 0.7%). In germination experiments, T + UEx samples showed normal seed germination of maize. However, in T + Ex samples, the seed germination depended on the grain protectant efficacy of the tested botanical extracts. Always higher percantage seed germination was recorded in those treatments where there was less infestation. Extracts of Carica papaya had significantly reduced the incidence of seed-borne fungus Aspergillus flavus (4 ± 2.4%) and did not affect the seed germination when compared to other treatments and untreated control. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Chakradhar D.; Narendra A.; Nagaraju K.,Archives of Phytopathology and Plant Protection,2010,10.1080/03235400902753758,0.971096978326861,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.973651157164911,0.0263488428350895,0.999974811178325,2.51888216751261e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
9901,Investigations of specialised metabolites of endophyte Diaporthe destruens hosted in Illigera orbiculata C. Y. Wu,"A chemical investigation of the endophytic fungus Diaporthe destruens from the Hernandiaceae plant Illigera orbiculata C. Y. Wu collected from southern Yunnan Province, China, led to the isolation of six undescribed compounds, including two azaphilone analogs, which are a pair of epimers (13R-hydroxy-chermesinone A and 13S-hydroxy-chermesinone A); a pyrrole derivative (1-(4-(methoxymethyl)-1H-pyrrol-3-yl)ethan-1-one); an isoindolone derivative (4-hydroxy-6-methoxyisoindolin-1-one); a benzylbenzene derivative (destruensine A) and a conjectural fragment of polyketide ((2R,4R)-2-(methoxymethyl)pentane-1,4-diol) along with nine known compounds. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods and HRESIMS, and the absolute con-figurations were further confirmed by electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and chemical derivatization.

2087,Changes in Neotyphodium coenophialum infestation levels in tall fescue pastures due to different grazing pressures,"Infection of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb,) with the mutualistic fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum (Morgan-Jones & Gems) Glenn, Bacon & Hanlin results in numerous biochemical and physiological changes that increase host persistence. This study was conducted to determine effects of steer (Bos taurus L.) grazing on changes in endophyte infestation levels of tall fescue pastures, Eighteen 1.2-ha pastures were seeded in 1992 in 20-cm drill rows involving combinations of high, medium, or low grazing pressure and 'Ky 31' tall fescue infested with N. coenophialum at four levels ranging from endophyte-free (E-) to 80% infestation (E+), Pastures were grazed for about 10 mo. each year from fall 1993 until summer 1996, although animals on some of the high grazing pressure pastures occasionally had to be removed because of insufficient forage, Endophyte levels were monitored yearly with protein-A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PAS ELISA). Stand density of tall fescue remained satisfactory throughout the study, After 2 yr, endophyte infestation levels in low grazing pressure pastures were at the same level as at the beginning of the study, and E+ levels remained constant in all pastures that started at high E+, regardless of grazing pressure. However, in high and medium grazing pressure pastures, E+ levels increased by 20 to 30%. Based on these data, we conclude that moderate and high grazing pressures influence endophyte infestation level of pastures and must be taken into account when designing pasture management systems.","Gwinn, KD; Fribourg, HA; Waller, JC; Saxton, AM; Smith, MC",CROP SCIENCE,1998,10.2135/cropsci1998.0011183X003800010033x,0.958769288294072,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.960617997182357,0.0393820028176434,0.999998884409019,1.11559098103786e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15652,Geographic distribution and ecological functions of Tetraplosphaeriaceae; [四绺孢球腔菌科真菌地理分布及其生态学功能],"Based on the multigenetic phylogenetic analysis of ITS, LSU, rpb2, tef1 and tub2, seven endophytic fungi of Pleosporales in plants of Poaceae in Yunnan Province were identified as Tetraploa and Pseudotetraploa of Tetraplosphaeriaceae and a taxonomically uncertain genus of Pleosporales. Two endophytes of Tetraploa and Pseudotetraploa were found to have stronger activities of cellulase and laccase, while the isolates of genera incertae sedis displayed comparatively weak cellulase activities and without laccase activity on sodium carboxymethyl cellulose medium and guaiacol medium, indicating that the activities of cellulose and lignin degradation abilities were different between taxa. Multiple correspondence analysis showed that the colonization of genera of Tetraplosphaeriaceae were correlated with host, isolated source and geographical location. Tetraploa and Pseudotetraploa can survive as endophytes in living healthy plants, and they also can be isolated from litter and soil. It is suggested that Tetraploa and Pseudotetraploa are endophytic and saprophytic dual-niche fungi. Further investigation of Tetraplosphaeriaceae participating in decomposition of grass plant litter is necessary for enriching our understanding of the diversity and ecological function of endophytic fungi in plants of Poaceae.

8788,ENDOGLUCANASE PRODUCTION BY ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI ISOLATED FROM Vitis labrusca L. WITH PEANUT HULL AND SAWDUST AS SUBSTRATES,"Endoglucanases are enzymes widely employed in different industrial fields, albeit with high production costs. Studies on new microbial sources and low-cost substrates are highly relevant, including those on agro-industrial. Current analysis evaluates peanut hull (PH) and sawdust (SD) as substrates for submerged cultures of 14 endophytic fungi isolated from grapevine (Vitis labrusca L.) cultivars Bordo and Concord. Endophytes were grown on a carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) medium and the cup plate assay showed that eight strains (belonging to genera Cochliobolus, Diaporthe, Fusarium and Phoma) had positive results: enzymatic halos ranged from 10.8 +/- 0.02 to 15.5 +/- 0.07 mm in diameter. Diaporthe sp. strains (GenBank accession codes KM362392, KM362368 and KM362378) and Fusarium culmorum KM362384 were highlighted as the most promising sources. Further, PH and SD as substrates for the fermentation of these fungi were evaluated by the cup plate assay and endoglucanase activity assay. Highest halo diameters were obtained for Diaporthe sp. KM362392: 16.1 +/- 0.01 mm (CMC), 14.5 +/- 0.01 mm (PH) and 14.7 +/- 0.03 mm (SD). The fungus also presented the highest levels of endoglucanase activity: analysis of variance revealed that CMC (3.52 +/- 0.98 mu mol/min), PH (2.93 +/- 0.23 mu mol/min) and SD (3.26 +/- 0.38 mu mol/min) were similarly efficient as substrates. Results deepen knowledge on V. labrusca endophytes that may be endoglucanase sources, even though further optimizations in submerged cultures with PH and SD should be undertaken to increase the enzymatic production from these wastes.","Felber, AC; Specian, V; Orlandelli, RC; Costa, AT; Polonio, JC; Mourao, KSM; Pamphile, JA",BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL,2019,10.14393/BJ-v35n3a2019-42403,0.969920468171149,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.982542704737167,0.0174572952628333,0.999998063707869,1.93629213118829e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Methods A total of 112 D. officinale samples were respectively collected from Anhui Huoshan (AHHS), Guizhou Dushan (GZDS) and Yunnan Menglian (YNML) and surveyed for their agronomic traits. The endophytic fungi community structure was analyzed by ITS sequencing, and the correlation between the abundance of endophytic fungi in different habitats and the host agronomic traits were analyzed by R language. Results The difference analysis showed that there were significant differences in plant height, stem length and stem diameter of D. officinale from the three habitats (P＜0.05). A total of 923 characteristic sequences of endophytic fungi were obtained by ITS assay, which could be annotated to three phylum, 138 genus. The distribution difference of endophytic fungi in D. officinale from different habitats were shown at genus level, and the diversities of AHHS fungal community were significantly different from that of other places. The relative correlation analysis showed there were negative correlation between endophytic fungus Gibberella and the plant height, stem length, stem diameter of the host (P < 0.05). Conclusion The different agronomic traits formation of stems in different habitats were closely related to the changes in abundance of endophytic fungi which were common in D. officinale. © 2023 Editorial Office of Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs.

1692,Griseofulvin-producing Xylaria endophytes of Pinus strobus and Vaccinium angustifolium: evidence for a conifer-understory species endophyte ecology,"During three decades of research on conifer endophytes of the Acadian forest, numerous insights have been gained in conifer-fungal ecology and secondary metabolite production. Recently, we have explored endophyte assemblages of understory plants commonly occurring with pine. Here we report for the first time the production of the potent antifungal compound griseofulvin by a fungal endophyte isolated from eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) needles and lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) stems from the Acadian forest of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis has placed the endophyte strains as an undescribed Xylaria sp. Our study highlights the complexity of endophyte-host lifecycles and points to the existence of a pine-blueberry ecotype. Aside from griseofulvin, piliformic acid was isolated from one of the pine endophytes. This compound has been reported from Xylaria and related species but not from Penicillium species known to produce griseofulvin. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

958,Aploneura lentisci (Homoptera: Aphididae) and Its Interactions with Fungal Endophytes in Perennial Ryegrass (Lolium perenne),"Aploneura lentisci Pass. is endemic to the Mediterranean region where it is holocyclic, forming galls on its primary host, Pistacia lentiscus and alternating over a 2-year period between Pistacia and secondary hosts, principally species of Gramineae. This aphid is widely distributed in Australia and New Zealand on the roots of the common forage grasses, ryegrass (Lolium spp.) and tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix) where it exists as permanent, anholocyclic, parthenogenetic populations. Previous studies have indicated that infestations of A. lentisci significantly reduce plant growth and may account for differences in field performance of Lolium perenne infected with different strains of the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae var. lolii. These obligate biotrophs protect their host grasses from herbivory via the production of alkaloids. To confirm the hypothesis that growth of L. perenhe is associated with the effect of different endophyte strains on aphid populations, herbage and root growth were measured over time in two pot trials that compared three fungal endophyte strains with an endophyte-free control. In both pot trials, aphid numbers were lowest on plants infected with endophyte strain AR37 at all sampling times. In plants infected with a common toxic strain naturalized in New Zealand, aphid numbers overall were lower than on uninfected plants or those infected with strain AR1, but numbers did not always differ significantly from these treatments. Populations on AR1-infected plants were occasionally significantly higher than those on endophyte-free. Cumulative foliar growth was reduced in AR1 and Nil treatments relative to AR37 in association with population differences of A. lentisci in both trials and root dry weight was reduced in one trial. In four Petri dish experiments survival of A. lentisci on plants infected with AR37 declined to low levels after an initial phase of up to 19 days during which time aphids fed and populations were similar to those on plants without endophyte. Aphids on AR37-infected plants became uncoordinated in their movement and developed tremors before dying suggesting a neurotoxin was responsible for their mortality. Results support the hypothesis that differences in A. lentisci populations due to endophyte infection status and strain affects plant growth.","Popay, AJ; Cox, NR",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2016,10.3389/fpls.2016.01395,0.997873566457789,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999999999213468,7.86532088626274e-10,1,0,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18298,Seed Endophyte Microbiome of Crotalaria pumila Unpeeled: Identification of Plant-Beneficial Methylobacteria.,"Metal contaminated soils are increasing worldwide. Metal-tolerant plants growing on metalliferous soils are fascinating genetic and microbial resources. Seeds can vertically transmit endophytic microorganisms that can assist next generations to cope with environmental stresses, through yet poorly understood mechanisms. The aims of this study were to identify the core seed endophyte microbiome of the pioneer metallophyte Crotalaria pumila throughout three generations, and to better understand the plant colonisation of the seed endophyte Methylobacterium sp. Cp3. Strain Cp3 was detected in C. pumila seeds across three successive generations and showed the most dominant community member. When inoculated in the soil at the time of flowering, strain Cp3 migrated from soil to seeds. Using confocal microscopy, Cp3-mCherry was demonstrated to colonise the root cortex cells and xylem vessels of the stem under metal stress. Moreover, strain Cp3 showed genetic and in planta potential to promote seed germination and seedling development. We revealed, for the first time, that the seed microbiome of a pioneer plant growing in its natural environment, and the colonisation behaviour of an important plant growth promoting systemic seed endophyte.

10151,"Palatability, digestibility and intake of endophyte free and infected tall fescue hay.","This paper aims to clarify the potential effect of the endophytic fungus, Acremonium coenophialum, on the feeding value of tall fescue hay under climatic conditions and usual management in France. Two batches of hay were harvested from two fields sown with seeds of the same variety either totally infested (E+) or free (E-) of endophyte. Presence of the endophyte had no effect on the chemical composition or in vitro digestibility in hay nor on the dry matter in situ degradation kinetic assessed following the nylon bag procedure. In vivo digestibility of both hays, assessed on sheep in individual crates, was quite similar (E+: 57.0%; E-: 57.9%). However, the E- hay was clearly preferred by sheep during the palatability test (53.1 vs 15.7% rate of consumption) and was more ingested (54.7 vs 50.1 g/kg animal metabolic weight). The results showed, therefore, that the endophyte can induce some negative effects on palatability and volontary intake of tall fescue but without altering the potential digestibility of infested hay. Regarding further investigations on the effect of infested grass forages on animal productions, it appears that emphasis should be on the level of toxicity rather than on feeding value.","Emile, JC; Ghesquiere, M; Traineau, R",ANNALES DE ZOOTECHNIE,1996,10.1051/animres:19960502,0.9575855216455,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999998795774291,1.20422570876698e-6,0.999993509580697,6.49041930345096e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

19095,Roles of endophytic fungi in medicinal plant abiotic stress response and TCM quality development.,"Medicinal plants, as medicinal materials and important drug components, have been used in traditional and folk medicine for ages. However, being sessile organisms, they are seriously affected by extreme environmental conditions and abiotic stresses such as salt, heavy metal, temperature, and water stresses. Medicinal plants usually produce specific secondary metabolites to survive such stresses, and these metabolites can often be used for treating human diseases. Recently, medicinal plants have been found to partner with endophytic fungi to form a long-term, stable, and win-win symbiotic relationship. Endophytic fungi can promote secondary metabolite accumulation in medicinal plants. The close relationship can improve host plant resistance to the abiotic stresses of soil salinity, drought, and extreme temperatures. Their symbiosis also sheds light on plant growth and active compound production. Here, we show that endophytic fungi can improve the host medicinal plant resistance to abiotic stress by regulating active compounds, reducing oxidative stress, and regulating the cell ion balance. We also identify the deficiencies and burning issues of available studies and present promising research topics for the future. This review provides guidance for endophytic fungi research to improve the ability of medicinal plants to resist abiotic stress.

53,The Relationship between Endophytic Fungi of Chimonanthus praecox and Volatile Metabolites under Different Circadian Rhythms and Blooming Stages,"Chimonanthus praecox is an aromatic plant that flowers in winter. The composition of the floral volatiles of C. praecox is influenced by different blooming stages, circadian rhythms and species. However, the relationship between floral volatiles and plant endophytic fungi has not received much research attention. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing technology to compare and analyze the changes in the structure and diversity of the endophytic fungal communities in C. praecox under different circadian rhythms (7:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., and 7:00 p.m.) and in different blooming stages (unopened flowers and opened flowers). The endophytic fungi of C. praecox consisted of nine phyla, 34 classes, 79 orders, 181 families, 293 genera, and 397 species, and Ascomycota was the dominant phylum. Under a diurnal rhythm, the diversity (Chao1 and Shannon indices) of endophytic fungi gradually decreased in the unopened flowers, while an increasing and then decreasing trend was found for the opened flowers. In the different blooming stages, the endophytic fungal diversity was significantly higher at 7:00 a.m. in the unopened flowers compared to the opened flowers. Humidity was the key factors that significantly affected the endophytic fungal diversity and community. Moreover, 11 endophytic fungi were significantly positively or negatively correlated with seven floral volatiles. In conclusion, the community structure and diversity of endophytic fungi in C. praecox were affected by the different blooming stages and circadian rhythms, and a correlation effect related to floral volatiles was found, but there are other possible reasons that were not tested. This study provides a theoretical basis for elucidating the interrelationships between endophytic fungi, floral volatiles, and environmental factors in C. praecox.","Li, Y; Hei, JY; He, XH; Rui, R; Wang, S",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2024,10.3390/jof10020145,0.963387320288656,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999913687173071,8.63128269290676e-5,0.999999451838385,5.48161614655207e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5864,Microbiomes across root compartments are shaped by inoculation with a fungal biological control agent,"While the endosphere is a hotspot for close interactions between plants and microbes, the influence of different components of the root endosphere on microbiome composition are seldom explored. This study used the fleshy taprooted plant, American Ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) and the recently discovered beneficial microbe, Trichoderma atroviride strain HB20111, to provide insights into microbiome shifts across plant-soil compartment niches including the bulk soil, rhizosphere, epidermis, cortex and vascular tissue. Trichoderma impacted both plant growth and microbiome composition. The survival rate of ginseng plants significantly increased from 70.8% to 85.4%, following Trichoderma treatment while root biomass production increased by 1.2 to 1.5 times compared with the uninoculated control. Microbiome diversity gradually decreased in niches from the bulk soil outside the root toward the vascular tissue, indicating increased selection and suggesting the possibility of a Trichoderma-driven induced systemic or localized resistance. The significant reduction (P < 0.05) in relative abundance of ginseng bacterial pathogens at the cortex confirmed the biocontrol capability of strain HB20111. We conclude that application of Trichoderma can improve growth of American Ginseng and mediate endosphere microbiome composition, resulting in plant pathogen inhibition.","Li, HM; Toh, R; Wei, YL; Wang, YL; Hu, JD; An, SH; Yang, K; Wu, YZ; Li, JS; Philp, J; Ryder, M; Zhou, Y; Denton, MD",APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,2022,10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104230,0.977610655206004,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991503566972395,0.00849643302760532,0.999998901465733,1.09853426721873e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
277,Diversity and antimicrobial activity of endophytic fungi isolated from Securinega suffruticosa in the Yellow River Delta,"Securinega suffruticosa (Pall.) Rehd is an excellent natural secondary shrub in the Shell Islands of Yellow River Delta. The roots of S. suffruticosa have high medicinal value and are used to treat diseases, such as neurasthenia and infant malnutrition. Any organism that is isolated from this species is of immense interest due to its potential novel bioactive compounds. In this research, the distribution and diversity of culturable endophytic fungi in S. suffruticosa were studied, and the endophytic fungi with antimicrobial activity were screened. A total of 420 endophytic fungi isolates were obtained from the S. suffruticosa grown in Shell Islands, from which 20 genera and 35 species were identified through morphological and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analyses. Chaetomium, Fusarium, Cladosporium, and Ceratobasidium were the dominant genera. The high species richness S (42), Margalef index D' (5.6289), Shannon-Wiener index H' (3.1000), Simpson diversity index D-s (0.9459), PIE index (0.8670), and evenness Pielou index J (0.8719) and a low dominant index lambda (0.0541) indicated the high diversity of endophytic fungi in S. suffruticosa, the various species of endophytic fungi with obvious tissue specificity. The inhibition percentages of the 12 species of such endophytic fungi against Colletotrichum siamense were 3.6%-26.3%. C. globosum, Fusarium sp.3, and C. ramotenellum had a high antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) were between 0.5 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL. Alkaloid content detection indicated that endophytic fungi had a high alkaloid content, whereas the alkaloid contents of C. globosum and Fusarium sp.3 reached 0.231% and 0.170%, respectively. Members belonging to the endophytic fungal community in the S. suffruticosa of Shell Islands that may be used as antagonists and antibacterial agents for future biotechnology applications were identified for the first time.","Du, W; Yao, ZG; Li, JL; Sun, CL; Xia, JB; Wang, BG; Shi, DL; Ren, LL",PLOS ONE,2020,10.1371/journal.pone.0229589,0.979689381983151,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999877235493897,1.2276450610285e-4,0.999999999979638,2.03617123162303e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
763,Mutualism effectiveness of a fungal endophyte in an annual grass is impaired by ozone,"Ozone is an increasing tropospheric contaminant of climate change. Exposure to ozone may affect the symbiotic relationship between plants and beneficial microorganisms. In particular, the herbivore resistance mechanism conferred by fungal endophytes (defensive mutualism) may be affected, as any of the ozone-triggered effects (such as elicitation of defence mechanisms against biotrophic fungi or oxidative stress in the apoplastic space) may target the symbiont. Symbiotic and non-symbiotic Lolium multiflorum plants were exposed to ozone for two consecutive days (2h per day), after which half were infested with 10 aphids (Rhopalosiphum padi). We measured variables related to performance of plants, the endophyte symbiont (alkaloids) and the herbivores. Aphid populations were smaller on symbiotic plants than in non-symbiotic plants in low-ozone conditions. However, this difference disappeared in exposed plants to high-ozone conditions. Under low-ozone conditions, structure of aphid populations on endophyte-symbiotic plants was characterized by a low number of nymphs and a high number of adults. This pattern was not observed with high-ozone exposure. Level of fungal alkaloids (lolines) was not affected by either ozone or herbivory. Results indicate that ozone impairs the grass-endophyte symbiosis without affecting production of alkaloids generally linked with aphids' response to endophyte presence. Since neither plant biomass nor alkaloid level were affected by ozone, other ozone-mediated mechanisms at molecular or biochemical level may underlie plant-herbivore interaction mediated by fungal endophytes. Thus, the mechanism behind this effect must be determined in future experiments.","Ueno, AC; Gundel, PE; Omacini, M; Ghersa, CM; Bush, LP; Martínez-Ghersa, MA",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,2016,10.1111/1365-2435.12519,0.980667899395685,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993388132500201,0.006611867499799,0.999970716049544,2.92839504559828e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
20936,"Endophytic fungi in Quercus cerris: Isolation frequency in relation to phenological phase, tree health and the organ affected","The isolation frequency of endophytic fungi in Quercus cerris was determined in relation to sampling data, the health state of the tree, and the tree organ affected. Sampling was carried out at three times, in April (budbreak), June (full vegetation) and October (leaf fall), on trees that were either healthy or in decline, and on three organs: current-year twigs, with a diameter less than 2 cm, buds, and leaves. The experiment was done in an approximately 20-year-old oak forest at an altitude of 350-400 m above sea level. Three healthy and three declining trees were sampled annually in 1999 and 2000. From each tree 20 current-year twigs, 20 buds and 10 leaves were harvested. Tissue fragments, after sterilization with 10% H2O2, were incubated on potato-dextrose-agar amended with streptomycin, at 20°C in the dark for 7 days, and the isolated mycelia maintained at 4°C on malt-extract agar. A total of 15 fungal species were isolated. All organs yielded fungal species but the greatest number of endophytic species came from current year twigs. Individual species were isolated more often from declining trees than from healthy trees, and more fungi were isolated in June (full vegetation) than in April or October. Diplodia mutila, Discula quercina and Phomopsis quercina, which are known to be pathogenetic on oaks, were present on oaks for a large part of the year. These fungi are both saprophytes (as endophytes) and parasites and are, therefore, probably a serious contributing and inciting factor in the oak decline syndrome.",Ragazzi A.; Moricca S.; Capretti P.; Dellavalle I.; Mancini F.; Turco E.,Phytopathologia Mediterranea,2001,NA,0.924221447328306,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.701264668376183,0.298735331623817,0.999962813022315,3.71869776848444e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
9043,Composition and Assembly of the Endophytic Fungal Community of Alpine Rhododendron Hosts Along Elevation Gradients,"Alpine mountain ecosystems are highly sensitive to global warming and threatened by climate change. Elevation gradients are frequently used as space-for-time surrogates for climate change in mountain ecosystems due to their correspondence with climate variables over short geographic distances. However, the distribution patterns of fungal communities in perennial woody plants along elevations in this ecosystem and how elevation and host identity affect them remain unclear. In this work, we used Illumina MiSeq DNA sequencing technology to study the rhizosphere soil fungal community and root and leaf endophytic fungal community assembly of alpine Rhododendron communities across a 3,100- to 4,100-m elevation gradient on Jiaozi Mountain, Southwest China. The abundance and diversity of fungi in different compartments varied among elevation gradients and hosts. The fungal community assembly in each compartment was mainly influenced by stochastic processes. However, the contribution of homogeneous selection, dispersal limitation, and drift varied among host identities and elevations in different compartments. The diversity and composition of rhizosphere soil, root, and leaf guilds and the overall abundance of fungal functional groups tracked the Rhododendron host identity more closely than elevation did. Most indicator taxa of fungi were putative saprotrophs. These findings will improve our understanding of the maintenance of alpine Rhododendron communities along elevation gradients.

5693,"Streptomyces typhae sp. nov., a novel endophytic actinomycete with antifungal activity isolated the root of cattail (Typha angustifolia L.)","A novel endophytic actinomycete with antagonistic activity against various phytopathogenic fungi, designated strain p1417(T), was isolated from the root of cattail (Typha angustifolia L.) collected from Yunnan Province, Southwest China. A polyphasic taxonomic study was carried out to establish the taxonomic status of this strain. Strain p1417(T) was found to have morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics typical of the genus Streptomyces. The diamino acid present in the cell wall was LL-diaminopimelic acid. Xylose and arabinose occurred in whole cell hydrolysates. The menaquinones were identified as MK-9(H-8), MK-9(H-6) and MK-9(H-4). The polar lipid profile was found to contain diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol mannoside. The major fatty acids were found to be iso-C-16:0, anteiso-C(15:0,)iso-C-15:0 and C-16:0. The genomic DNA G + C content of strain p1417(T) based on the genome sequence was 72.0 mol%. Based on 16 S rRNA gene, five housekeeping genes and whole genome sequences analysis, strain p1417(T) was most closely related to Streptomyces flavofungini JCM 4753(T) (99.4% 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Streptomyces alboflavus JCM 4615(T) (98.8%) and Streptomyces aureoverticillatus JCM 4347(T) (98.2%). However, the average nucleotide identity values, the digital DNA-DNA hybridization values and the multilocus sequence analysis evolutionary distances between this strain and its closely related strains showed that it belonged to one distinct species. In addition, these results were also supported by differences in the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics between strain p1417(T) and three closely related type strains. Therefore, it is concluded that strain p1417(T) represents a novel species of the genus of Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces typhae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is p1417(T) (= CCTCC AA 2019091(T) = DSM 110636(T)).","Peng, CH; Zhuang, XX; Gao, CT; Wang, ZY; Zhao, JW; Huang, SX; Liu, CX; Xiang, WS",ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY,2021,10.1007/s10482-021-01561-3,0.99094883242058,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991887473011034,0.00811252698896594,0.999994104668717,5.89533128292352e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

19737,Effects of Tall Fescue Endophyte Type and Dopamine Receptor D2 Genotype on Cow-Calf Performance during Late Gestation and Early Lactation.,"Grazing endophyte-infected, toxic tall fescue reduces cow/calf production; therefore, this study examines alternate strategies such as use of novel endophyte fescue varieties during late gestation and early lactation or genetic selection of resistant cows. Pregnant cows (n = 75) were randomly assigned to fescue endophyte type: 1) endophyte-infected ergot alkaloid producing tall fescue (E+) or 2) novel endophyte-infected, non-toxic tall fescue (NOV) within maternal (A|A, n = 38 and G|G, n = 37) DRD2 genotype to examine changes in cow/calf performance and milk production during late gestation and early lactation. Grazing E+ fescue pastures during late gestation reduced cow body weight gain but did not alter calf birth weight compared to NOV. Milk production and calf ADG during the first 30 day of lactation were lower for E+ than NOV. The calving rate was reduced, but not calving interval for E+ cows. The adjusted 205-day weight of calves was lower in those grazing E+ with their dams compared to NOV. There were no interactions between DRD2 genotype and fescue endophyte type indicating that genotype was not associated with response to E+ fescue in this study. Overall, grazing NOV tall fescue pastures rather than E+ during critical stages of production improved cow gain during late gestation, calving rate, early milk production and calf growth.",Wilbanks SA; Justice SM; West T; Klotz JL; Andrae JG; Duckett SK,Toxins,2021,10.3390/toxins13030195,0.874570097224614,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.948710973845736,0.051289026154264,0.99999999872469,1.27531041282936e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
14441,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate fungi in plants associated with aquatic environments,"Th ere have been several reports of symbionts in the roots of plants that live in aquatic environments. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are the most common microsymbionts and possibly recolonized the aquatic environment together with plants; however, their functions and the extent of their benefits are unclear. Furthermore, the presence of other groups of fungi, such as dark septate fungi (DSF), with functions supposedly analogous to those of mycorrhizal fungi, has also been reported. Th e present work provides a compilation of data regarding the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizae in plants from, or under the infl uence of, aquatic environments, and co-colonization by AMF and DSF. Forty species of non-vascular plants, ferns, fern allies, and gymnosperms from 15 families, and 659 species of angiosperms from 87 families were investigated. From the first group (non-fl owering plants) 57 % of the species showed arbuscular mycorrhizal structures in their tissues or roots, whereas among the second group (fl owering plants) 71 % had such structures. Among the mycorrhizal angiosperms, 52 % showed arbuscules in their roots. DSF were found in 1 % of non-fl owering plants and 5 % of angiosperms.

9290,Potential biological control of lesion nematodes on banana using Kenyan strains of endophytic Fusarium oxysporum,"The root-lesion nematode Pratylenchus goodeyi is a common pest of banana in Kenya, which results in significant yield losses. An emerging option for the management of banana nematodes includes the use of endophytic fungi, which cause no damage to their hosts but often extend benefits, such as enhanced protection against various biotic and abiotic constraints. In the current study, non-pathogenic Fusarium oxysporum strains originating from banana (Musa spp.) in Kenya (4MOC321 and 11SR23) and Uganda (V5w2) were evaluated for their efficacy against P. goodeyi in tissue culture-derived plantlets (cv. Giant Cavendish and cv. Grand Nain) in pots. Pratylenchus goodeyi densities were 47-60% lower in endophyte-inoculated relative to non-inoculated plants and root necrosis damage was reduced by >30%. Endophyte treatment had no effect on plant growth parameters compared with untreated control plants. The performance of the two Kenyan strains was equally effective as the positive control (V5w2), thus demonstrating their potential as nematode bio-control agents under Kenyan growing conditions.","Waweru, BW; Losenge, T; Kahangi, EM; Dubois, T; Coyne, D",NEMATOLOGY,2013,10.1163/156854112X645606,0.923121417449808,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.752024171265638,0.247975828734362,0.999964298588364,3.57014116361132e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
7676,A potential antioxidant resource: Endophytic fungi from medicinal plants,"Medicinal plants and their endophytes are important resources for discovery of natural products. Several previous studies have found a positive correlation between total antioxidant capacity (TAQ and total phenolic content (TPC) of many medicinal plant extracts. However, no information is available on whether such a relationship also exists in their endophytic fungal metabolites. We investigated the relationship between TAC and TPC for 292 morphologically distinct enclophytic fungi isolated from 29 traditional Chinese medicinal plants. The antioxidant capacities of the enclophytic fungal cultures were significantly correlated with their total phenolic contents, suggesting that phenolics were also the major antioxidant constituents of the endophytes. Some of the endophytes were found to produce metabolites possessing strong antioxiclant activities. Several bioactive constituents from the fungal cultures and host plant extracts were identified. This investigation reveals that the metabolites produced by a wide diversity of enclophytic fungi in culture can be a potential source of novel natural antioxidants.","Huang, WY; Cai, YZ; Xing, J; Corke, H; Sun, M",ECONOMIC BOTANY,2007,10.1663/0013-0001(2007)61[14:APAREF]2.0.CO;2,0.728102998576255,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991729878548442,0.00827012145155808,0.999999999986859,1.31411548309757e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

18879,Comprehensive Biotechnological Strategies for Podophyllotoxin Production from Plant and Microbial Sources.,"Podophyllotoxin is derived from plant sources and exhibits strong anticancer activity. However, limited natural availability and environmental impacts from traditional extraction methods drive the search for alternative production approaches. This review explores diverse strategies for sustainable podophyllotoxin synthesis, including biosynthesis, semi-synthesis, and biotransformation. Biosynthetic methods involve metabolic pathway engineering in plant or microbial cells, enabling increased yields by manipulating precursor availability and gene expression. Semi-synthetic approaches modify podophyllotoxin precursors or intermediates to enhance therapeutic effects, with derivatives like etoposide and teniposide showing clinical efficacy. Biotransformation, utilising organisms such as endophytic fungi or human hepatic enzymes, enables the transformation of substrates like deoxypodophyllotoxin into podophyllotoxin or its derivatives, yielding compounds with reduced environmental impact and improved purity. The anticancer efficacy of podophyllotoxin and its derivatives stems from multiple mechanisms. These compounds disrupt cell mitosis by inhibiting microtubule assembly, impairing nucleoside transport, and blocking topoisomerase II activity, leading to DNA cleavage and cancer cell apoptosis. Podophyllotoxin and its derivatives also exhibit anti-angiogenesis and anti-metastatic effects through signalling pathway modulation. Notably, derivatives like deoxypodophyllotoxin utilise advanced delivery systems, enhancing targeted efficacy and reducing side effects. Given the varied mechanisms and growing therapeutic applications, optimising biotransformation and delivery techniques remains essential for advancing podophyllotoxin-based therapies. This comprehensive review underscores the compound's potential as a robust anticancer agent and the need for continued research to maximise its production and clinical effectiveness.",Anviksha A; Reddy MS,Planta medica,2025,10.1055/a-2504-3069,0.945744789755603,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99309428648918,0.00690571351082041,0.999981832478188,1.81675218117183e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3386,"Growth, compatible solute and salt accumulation of five mycorrhizal fungal species grown over a range of NaCl concentrations","The oil sand industry in northeastern Alberta produces vast areas of severely disturbed land. The sodicity of these anthropic soils is one of the principal constraints that impede their revegetation. Previous in vitro studies have shown that the ectomycorrhizal fungi Laccaria bicolor (Maire) Orton UAMH 8232 and Hebeloma crustuliniforme (Bull) Quel. UAMH 5247 have certain salt-resistant traits and thus are candidate species for the inoculation of tree seedlings to be outplanted on salt-affected soil. In this study, the in vitro development of these fungi was compared to that of three mycorrhizal fungi [Suillus tomentosus (Kauff.) Sing., Snell and Dick; Hymenoscyphus sp. and Phialocephala sp.] isolated from a sodic site created by Syncrude Canada Ltd. Their growth, osmotica and Na/Cl contents were assessed over a range (0, 50, 100, 200 mM) of NaCl concentrations. After 21 days, the two ascomycetes (Hymenoscyphus sp. and Phialocephala sp.) were shown to be more resistant to the NaCl treatments than the three basidiomycete species. Of the basidiomycetes, L. bicolor was the most sensitive to NaCl stress, while H. crustuliniforme showed greater water stress resistance, and the S. tomentosus isolate exhibited greater Na and Cl filtering capacities and had a better biomass yield over the NaCl gradient tested. Both ascomycetes used mechanisms other than carbohydrate accumulation to palliate NaCl stress. While the Hymenoscyphus isolate accumulated proline in response to NaCl treatments, the darker Phialocephala isolate may have used compounds such as melanin. The basidiomycete species accumulated mainly mannitol and/or proline in response to increasing concentrations of NaCl.","Bois, G; Bertrand, A; Piché, Y; Fung, M; Khasa, DP",MYCORRHIZA,2006,10.1007/s00572-005-0020-y,0.985771631922398,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998252949481596,0.00174705051840366,0.999999880616476,1.19383523622396e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
9529,Endophytic Fungi Inoculation Reduces Ramulosis Severity in Gossypium hirsutum Plants,"Biotic stress in cotton plants caused by the phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum gossypii var. cephalosporioides triggers symptoms of ramulosis, a disease characterized by necrotic spots on young leaves, followed by death of the affected branch's apical meristem, plant growth paralysis, and stimulation of lateral bud production. Severe cases of ramulosis can cause up to 85% yield losses in cotton plantations. Currently, this disease is controlled exclusively by using fungicides. However, few studies have focused on biological alternatives for mitigating the effects of contamination by C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides on cotton plants. Thus, the hypothesis raised is that endophytic fungi isolated from an Arecaceae species (Butia purpurascens), endemic to the Cerrado biome, have the potential to reduce physiological damage caused by ramulosis, decreasing its severity in these plants. This hypothesis was tested using plants grown from seeds contaminated with the pathogen and inoculated with strains of Gibberella moniliformis (BP10EF), Hamigera insecticola (BP33EF), Codinaeopsis sp. (BP328EF), G. moniliformis (BP335EF), and Aspergillus sp. (BP340EF). C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides is a leaf pathogen; thus, the evaluations were focused on leaf parameters: gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and oxidative metabolism. The hypothesis that inoculation with endophytic strains can mitigate physiological and photochemical damage caused by ramulosis in cotton was confirmed, as the fungi improved plant growth and stomatal index and density, increased net photosynthetic rate (A) and carboxylation efficiency (A/Ci), and decreased photochemical stress (ABS/RC and DI0/RC) and oxidative stress by reducing enzyme activity (CAT, SOD, and APX) and the synthesis of malondialdehyde (MDA). Control plants developed leaves with a low adaxial stomatal index and density to reduce colonization of leaf tissues by C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides due to the absence of fungal antagonism. The Codinaeopsis sp. strain BP328EF can efficiently inhibit C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides in vitro (81.11% relative inhibition), improve gas exchange parameters, reduce photochemical stress of chlorophyll-a, and decrease lipid peroxidation in attacked leaves. Thus, BP328EF should be further evaluated for its potential effect as a biological alternative for enhancing the resistance of G. hirsutum plants and minimizing yield losses caused by C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides.","Silva, ID; Bessa, LA; Reis, MNO; Augusto, DSS; Roweder, C; Souchie, EL; Vitorino, LC",MICROORGANISMS,2024,10.3390/microorganisms12061124,0.97789224351321,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.976610038517601,0.0233899614823985,0.999999977429763,2.25702366796199e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

In addition to their pathogenicity to arthropods, they have many other important effects that favor their use in biological control. They live in plants as endophytes and have an inhibitory effect on plant pathogens. They inhabit the rhizosphere of many plants in natural and agricultural ecosystems and have a stimulatory effect on their growth and development. These recently acquired ecological functions are not yet fully understood, but point to the broader potential of using entomopathogenic endophytic fungi in crop production, not only as biopesticides but also as mycofungicides and growth stimulants (biostimulants). To achieve the full potential of entomopathogenic endophytic fungi in daily agricultural practice, practical application should be considered in the development of commercial products and the application techniques of entomopathogenic endophytic fungi that allow successful colonization of plants should be considered. © 2021 University of Ljubljana.

Results showed that the concentrations of soil organic carbon, total carbon, and total nitrogen of rhizosphere soil in inoculation group were 2.1, 1.7, and 1.3 times as high as that in uninoculated group. Besides, concentrations of Cd, Pb, As, Cu, and Zn in inoculation soil were 79 %, 33 %, 65 %, 14 %, and 51 % lower than that in uninoculated soil. Metagenomic study indicated that S. luteus inoculation had no strong effect on diversity and richness of microbial communities in rhizosphere soil, but increased the relative abundance of certain HM-resistant microorganisms such as phylum Actinobacteria and genus Streptomyces. Metabolism-oriented functional annotation further revealed that in inoculation group the abundance of coding sequences related to nutrients metabolism (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolism) and HMs resistance (e.g., HMs transformation and efflux) distinctly differed from that in uninoculated group. In short, our findings may elucidate the potential contribution of S. luteus inoculation that affects the structure composition and metabolic functions of microbial communities to mediate the concentration variation of nutrients and HMs in rhizosphere ecosystem.","Yin, SQ; Zhang, X; Xie, JQ; Ye, XY; Zhang, X",APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,2023,10.1016/j.apsoil.2023.105019,0.633424119894768,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999999546251608,4.53748391521442e-7,0.999999999999284,7.15760783975838e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

4732,Endophytic Beauvea bassiana increases galling of 'Rutgers' tomato roots with Meloidogyne incognita,"Beauveria bassiana is endophytic in many plant species and has been shown to protect host plants against insect pests and plant pathogens. However, less is known about its activity against plant-parasitic nematodes. In vitro and plant assays were conducted to determine the effect of B. bassiana 11-98 (Bb) on Meloidogyne incognita (root-knot nematode; RKN). Beauveria bassiana was confirmed as an endophyte in 'Rutgers' tomato and colonization patterns of Bb in 'Rutgers' (highly susceptible to RKN) were compared with those in 'Mountain Spring' (less susceptible to RKN). In greenhouse tests with 'Rutgers' at 30 and 60 days after treatment (DAT) with RKN and Bb, there were few differences in plant growth variables among treatments in repeated trials. However, RKN root galling and egg count/root system were enhanced in plants treated with Bb at 60 DAT. In an in vitro assay with egg masses from greenhouse tests, the percentages of hatched eggs, and mobile and immobile nematodes did not differ significantly for RKN and RKN+Bb treatments. The presence of viable Bb from roots was confirmed by collecting egg suspensions from root galls and plating them on selective medium. Colonies of Bb were verified on agar medium, but no parasitism of RKN eggs was observed. Research is needed to investigate factors responsible for increased galling by RKN in the presence of endophytic Bb in 'Rutgers' tomato.","Yerukala, S; Bernard, EC; Gwinn, KD; Butler, DM; Grewal, PS; Ownley, BH",JOURNAL OF NEMATOLOGY,2021,10.21307/jofnem-2021-072,0.949742589597548,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999555949505058,4.4405049494191e-4,0.999999999940612,5.93879390109464e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1447,DIFFERENTIAL PLANT-RESPONSE TO INOCULATION WITH 2 VA MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI ISOLATED FROM A LOW-PH SOIL,"Sericea lespedeza [Lespedeza cuneata] and Ladino clover [trifolium repens] were inoculated with Acaulospora laevis and Gigaspora margarita VA mycorrhizal fungi, both isolated from a local soil having a pH of 4.4. Plants were grown in a greenhouse in fumigated (methyl bromide) soil with four rates of applied P. This soil had a pH of 5.1 for the G. margarita experiment and a 5.8 for the A. laevis experiment. Neither plant species responded to the G. margarita isolate in terms of myocorrhizal infection of roots, top growth, or elemental uptake. The A. laevis isolate caused increased growth of Ladino clover at the lowest rate of P application and increased growth of sericea lespedeza at the two lowest P application rates. Shoot tissue concentrations of P for both plant species were greater at the two lowest rates of P application when inoculated with A. laevis. Inoculation with A. laevis also resulted in different VAM fungal root colonization patterns between the two plant species as a function of P application rate. Roots of both plants had high infection rates (near 70%) for the two lowest P application rates but sericea lespedeza declined to 40 and 6% at the next two P application rates, respectively, whereas infection in Ladino clover was 74 and 41% at the next two P application rates, respectively. The results of this study support the concept that plant host-VAM fungal endophyte interactions are extremely variable and that characterization of individual combinations must be done if types and magnitudes of responses are to be defined.","WILSON, DO",PLANT AND SOIL,1988,10.1007/BF02143541,0.98003461478552,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99895943565023,0.00104056434977017,0.999950970366552,4.90296334484386e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6967,"Zn tolerance in the evergreen shrub, Aucuba japonica, naturally growing at a mine site: Cell wall immobilization, aucubin production, and Zn adsorption on fungal mycelia","Aucuba japonica Thunb. is an evergreen understory shrub that grows naturally at a mine site. The mine soil contains high concentrations of heavy metals, and A. japonica appears to maintain detoxification mechanisms against heavy metals in the study site's understory. This study aimed to investigate the heavy metal tolerance mechanisms in A. japonica, considering the possible roles of arbuscular mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi. We conducted fieldwork in summer (canopy-foliation season) and winter (canopy-defoliation season) to measure the heavy metal concentrations in leaves, branches, and roots and analyze possible detoxicants in the roots. The infection rates of arbuscular mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi were evaluated via microscopic observation, and heavy metal (Zn) localization in A. japonica roots was observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Field analysis showed that A. japonica accumulated excessive Zn and produced aucubin and citric acid in the roots in both summer and winter. Zn localization observations clarified that Zn was distributed in thickened epidermal and cortical cell walls, suggesting that the cell walls functioned as Zn deposition sites, reducing Zn toxicity. It was further clarified that Zn was contained within cortical cells, indicating that Zn might be detoxified by aucubin and citric acid. Arbuscular mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi within cortical cells adsorbed Zn on fungal cell walls, indicating that these fungi would reduce Zn content within root cells and might alleviate Zn toxicity. Our results indicated that A. japonica would maintain Zn tolerance in both summer and winter via Zn immobilization in the cell walls and production of aucubin and citric acid, and that arbuscular mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi might play important roles in the Zn tolerance of A. japonica.","Doyama, K; Yamaji, K; Haruma, T; Ishida, A; Mori, S; Kurosawa, Y",PLOS ONE,2021,10.1371/journal.pone.0257690,0.870282129459672,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999151834181451,8.4816581854855e-4,0.999999999638317,3.61683238914168e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2642,"Inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhiza did not affect growth, root traits or gas exchange of grafted almond saplings when exposed to drought stress","Very little is known about potential benefits of using AM inoculation as a tool to alleviate drought stress of trees grown under nursery conditions. There is some evidence that benefits of mycorrhiza on gas exchange parameters and growth of trees are proportionally greater when trees are subjected to drought stress. We hypothesized that inoculation with mycorrhiza would increase growth, nutrition, stem water potential and gas exchange of containerized almond (Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb) when young trees are grown under low water availability. In the spring of 2015 and 2016, forty containerized almond trees (Nonpareil scion grafted on Hansen 536, a peach/almond hybrid rootstock) were either inoculated or not with a commercially available arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculum and kept well-watered for 60 days in 2015 and 54 days in 2016, after which half of the plants were exposed to gradually reduced water availability over 38 days in 2015 and 61 days in 2016. Measurements included growth metrics, stem water potential, stomatal density, leaf NPK concentration, light saturated photosynthesis, and parameters calculated from CO2 response curves (Vcmax, J, TPU, Rd, gm, and stomatal limitation).The low-water treatment decreased stem water potential and reduced trunk diameter growth, light saturated photosynthesis (A), stomatal conductance (gs), Vcmax, J, TPU, gm, specific root length, leaf N and K concentration and total leaf N, P, and K content. Inoculation decreased root mass, increased leaf mass fraction, and decreased root mass fraction in 2015, but not in 2016. Neither stem water potential nor gas exchange were significantly altered by inoculation. Inoculation decreased leaf stomatal density, and slightly elevated leaf N and P concentrations in the low water treatments, although not consistently across years. Contrary to expectations we did not find substantially greater benefits from mycorrhizal inoculation in young drought stressed almond trees and conclude that the potential for mycorrhizal inoculant to alleviate drought stress in containerized trees is minimal.","McClung, TN; Lampinen, BD; Gaudin, AC; Volder, A",PLANT STRESS,2024,10.1016/j.stress.2024.100475,0.991354091886725,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999998433359113,1.56664088695868e-6,0.999999955262857,4.47371426570697e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3809,Filamentous fungi from Plantago lanceolata L. leaves: Contribution to the pattern and stability of bioactive metabolites,"The aim of this study was to test contribution of plant-associated microorganism (PAMs) to metabolite stability/instability in a medicinal plant matrix. Therefore, PAM strains were isolated and identified based on relevant DNA sequences from Plantago lanceolata leaves. Sterile water extracts of P. lanceolata were incubated with the isolated strains and antioxidants (ascorbic acid (AA), and EDTA) for 15 days, and changes in the concentrations of chief bioactive constituents (aucubin, catalpol, acteoside (=verbascoside)) were quantified by capillary electrophoresis. Phenolic breakdown-products were identified by GC-MS. PAMs were identified from the genera Epicoccum, Bipolaris, Cladosporium, Leptosphaerulina, Aspergillus, Eurotium and Penicillium (pathongens, endophytes, and other species). Some fungi caused significant decomposition of the chief constituents (p < 0.001). Surprisingly, some strains inhibited breakdown of acteoside (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, concentration of several phenolic acids increased in fungi-infested extracts (p < 0.001). Gentisic acid, 4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and hydroxytyrosol were only present when the extract was infested with a PAM. The products are powerful antioxidants and chelators. Concentrations of phenolic acids influenced acteoside stability significantly (p < 0.01), as shown by basic data-mining techniques. AA and EDTA also significantly inhibited acteoside breakdown in sterile model solutions (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that the phenolic acid mixture (produced during the fungal proliferation) protected acteoside from breakdown, possibly via its antioxidant activity and metal complexing ability. It was shown that PAMs can increase or decrease the stability of chief metabolites in herbal matrices, and can significantly alter the chemical pattern of the plant matrix. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

9750,Gene flow in the endophyte Neotyphodium and implications for coevolution with Festuca arizonica,"Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) often harbours asymptomatic, asexual endophytic fungi from the genus Neotyphodium. In agronomic grasses, Neotyphodium endophytes are often credited with a wide range of mutualistic benefits to its host many of which are related to fungal production of alkaloids for herbivore deterrence. Neotyphodium in the native grass Arizona fescue, however, usually produces alkaloids at levels too low to deter herbivores, and in general, does not behave mutualistically. This study uses microsatellite markers to examine rates of gene flow among four Arizona populations of Neotyphodium. Haplotypic diversity was generally low; only one population contained more than two haplotypes. Haplotypes carrying multiple loci for some or all of the microsatellite loci were also found, indicating a vegetative hybridization event between Neotyphodium and the grass choke pathogen from the genus Epichloe. Gene flow between Neotyphodium populations is very low, and likely much lower than the pollen mediated gene flow of its host. These differing rates of gene flow are predicted to create trait mismatching between endophyte and host and may explain the low, or lack of, alkaloid production by Neotyphodium in Arizona fescue and other native grass species.","Sullivan, TJ; Faeth, SH",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2004,10.1046/j.1365-294X.2004.02091.x,0.988678506007003,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999981143600488,1.88563995115899e-5,0.999999989484378,1.05156220397973e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Using culture-based methods and ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA sequence analysis, we investigated differences between foliar endophyte communities in disease-resistant hybrid and wild-type Pinus monticola (Western white pine) trees with observed variation in tree growth, vigor, and browsing damage by white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We isolated 69 phylotypes of endophytic fungi in at least 39 genera, including 26 that have not previously been reported in P. monticola. Principal components analysis revealed that endophyte communities differed between browsed seedlings, unbrowsed seedlings, and unbrowsed adult trees. Sulfur, nitrate and calcium concentrations correlated with endophyte community differences among tree groups based on a distance-based redundancy analysis. Our results indicate that foliar nutrient variation influences endophyte community assembly and deer herbivory in P. monticola on a small landscape scale (80 hectares).

8868,"Molecular Characterization of Potential Crop Pathogens Associated with Weeds as Endophytes in Uniilorin Plantations, Nigeria","Crop diseases are usually caused by inoculum of pathogens which might exist on alternate hosts or weeds as endophytes. These endophytes, cum pathogens, usually confer some beneficial attributes to these weeds or alternate hosts from protection against herbivores, disease resistance, stress tolerance to secondary metabolites production. This study was therefore carried out to isolate potential crop pathogens which exist as endophytes on weed species in the University of Ilorin plantations. Green asymptomatic leaves were collected from 10 weed species across the plantations, and processed for their endophytic fungi isolation. Isolates were purified into pure cultures and used for molecular identification using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA. Phylogenetic analysis of the fungal sequences using MEGA software revealed 9 fungal genera belonging to 13 species, with species in the genera Curvularia, Epicoccum and Daldinia occurring in more than one weed species, while other genera such as Alternaria, Fusarium, Chaetomium, Macrophomina, Arthrinium and Phomopsis occurred in just one weed species each. Daldinia eschscholtzii was isolated in this study as an endophyte from Loudetia arundinacea for the first time. This plant is very abundant in Nigeria and Africa where it is used majorly for thatching and feeding livestocks. This also represents the first endophytic fungi from the genus Loudetia. Potential relationship between the occurrences of these fungi as endophytes and as pathogens are discussed. These discoveries represent the first large-scale molecular identification and several first reports of endophytes from these weed species.

Xanthium strumarium displaying resilience to various environmental fluctuations may harbor some bacterial isolates which can help this plant to grow worldwide. The present study aims to isolate endophytic and rhizospheric bacteria from X. strumarium and assess their plant growth-promoting and Ralstonia solanacearum antagonism activity. From a total of 148 isolated bacteria, 7 endophytic and 2 rhizospheric bacterial isolates were found to endow with significant in vitro plant growth promotion activities.

2823,Rhizospheric streptomycetes as potential biocontrol agents of Fusarium and Armillaria pine rot and as PGPR for Pinus taeda,"Pinus taeda is one of the main timber trees in Brazil, occupying 1.8 million ha with an annual productivity of 25-30 m(3) ha(-1). Another important species is Araucaria angustifolia, belonging to the fragile Rainforest biome, which for decades has been a major source of timber in Brazil. Some diseases that affect the roots and/or the stem of these trees and cause ""damping-off"" of the seedlings, with economic and environmental losses for the forest sector, are caused by the plant pathogenic fungi Fusarium sp. or Armillaria sp. This research project intended to isolate actinobacteria from the Araucaria rhizosphere, which present an antagonistic effect against these fungi. After the selection of the best pathogen inhibitors, morphologic characteristics, enzyme production, and their effect on the growth of Pinus taeda were studied. The actinobacteria were tested for their antagonistic capacity against Fusarium sp. in Petri plates with PDA as substrate. The inhibition zone was measured after 3, 5, 7, and 10 days. Of all the isolates tested, only two of them maintained inhibition zones up to 4 mm for 10 days. The inhibition of Armillaria sp. was tested in liquid medium and also in Petri dishes through the evaluation of the number of the fungal rhizomorphs in dual culture with the actinobacteria. It was found that all five isolates were able to inhibit the rhizomorph production, with the best performance of the isolate A43, which was capable of inhibiting both fungi, Fusarium and Armillaria. In a greenhouse experiment, the effect of five isolates on the growth of Pinus taeda seedlings was tested. Plant height, stem diameter, root and shoot dry matter were determined. The Streptomyces isolate A43 doubled plant growth.

The disease sterilizes plants by inhibiting the production of flowers. Diseased plants were also vegetatively more vigorous, producing more leaves than healthy ones. This enhanced growth of diseased plants is interpreted as being due to a trade-off between loss of reproductive capacity and vegetative growth. A 3-yr demographic study detected a tendency for greater survivorship among diseased P. pratensis plants. This may be due to the increased vigour of infected plants. No herbivore (leaf eating insects or cattle) was observed to consume P. pratensis, but disease levels varied greatly between localities that had been grazed and ungrazed by cattle. On grazed localities low disease levels prevailed while at ungrazed localities disease levels were high. This pattern appears to be due to greater survivorship among diseased plants and the failure of seedlings to establish in ungrazed localities.","WENNSTROM, A; ERICSON, L",OIKOS,1991,10.2307/3544989,0.856670076114134,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.72610697067282,0.27389302932718,0.999597498331534,4.0250166846556e-4,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
5447,Bacterial endophytes as indicators of susceptibility to Cercospora Leaf Spot (CLS) disease in Beta vulgaris L.,"The fungus Cercospora beticola causes Cercospora Leaf Spot (CLS) of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.). Despite the global importance of this disease, durable resistance to CLS has still not been obtained. Therefore, the breeding of tolerant hybrids is a major goal for the sugar beet sector. Although recent studies have suggested that the leaf microbiome composition can offer useful predictors to assist plant breeders, this is an untapped resource in sugar beet breeding efforts. Using Ion GeneStudio S5 technology to sequence amplicons from seven 16S rRNA hypervariable regions, the most recurring endophytes discriminating CLS-symptomatic and symptomless sea beets (Beta vulgaris L.ssp. maritima) were identified. This allowed the design of taxon-specific primer pairs to quantify the abundance of the most representative endophytic species in large naturally occurring populations of sea beet and subsequently in sugar beet breeding genotypes under either CLS symptomless or infection stages using qPCR. Among the screened bacterial genera, Methylobacterium and Mucilaginibacter were found to be significantly (p < 0.05) more abundant in symptomatic sea beets with respect to symptomless. In cultivated sugar beet material under CLS infection, the comparison between resistant and susceptible genotypes confirmed that the susceptible genotypes hosted higher contents of the above-mentioned bacterial genera. These results suggest that the abundance of these species can be correlated with increased sensitivity to CLS disease. This evidence can further prompt novel protocols to assist plant breeding of sugar beet in the pursuit of improved pathogen resistance.","Broccanello, C; Ravi, S; Deb, S; Bolton, M; Secor, G; Richards, C; Maretto, L; Della Lucia, MC; Bertoldo, G; Orsini, E; Ronquillo-Lopez, MG; Concheri, G; Campagna, G; Squartini, A; Stevanato, P",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2022,10.1038/s41598-022-14769-8,0.965364679613423,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.959283459979933,0.0407165400200669,0.999999990436448,9.5635516172976e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
8072,Daldinone derivatives from the mangrove-derived endophytic fungus Annulohypoxylon sp.,"Two new benzo[j] fluoranthene metabolites, daldinones H, J (1 and 3), and the likewise undescribed artefact, daldinone I (2), along with six known compounds (4-9) were isolated from the endophytic fungus Annulohypoxylon sp. that was obtained from the Mangrove plant Rhizophora racemosa collected in Cameroon. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR as well as by HRESIMS and ECD spectra analysis. Co-cultivation of this fungus with the actinomycetes Streptomyces lividans or with Streptomyces coelicolor resulted in an up to 38-fold increase of 1-hydroxy-8-methoxynaphthalene (9), while no significant induction was detected when the fungus was co-cultivated either with Bacillus subtilis or with Bacillus cereus. Compound 2 exhibited strong to moderate cytotoxicity against Ramos and Jurkat J16 cells with IC50 values of 6.6 and 14.1 mu M, respectively. Mechanistic studies indicated that compound 2 induces apoptotic cell death caused by induction of intrinsic apoptosis. Moreover, 2 potently blocks autophagy, a potential pro-survival pathway for cancer cells. Feeding experiments with 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) led to an enhanced accumulation of daldinone B (6), which supported the proposed biogenetic pathway.","Liu, Y; Stuhldreier, F; Kurtán, T; Mándi, A; Arumugam, S; Lin, W; Stork, B; Wesselborg, S; Weber, H; Henrich, B; Daletos, G; Proksch, P",RSC ADVANCES,2017,10.1039/c6ra27306h,0.512499445664545,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99899216625461,0.00100783374539012,0.999999310215215,6.89784784735359e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

17810,Tapping into the maize root microbiome to identify bacteria that promote growth under chilling conditions.,"When maize (Zea mays L.) is grown in the Northern hemisphere, its development is heavily arrested by chilling temperatures, especially at the juvenile phase. As some endophytes are beneficial for plants under stress conditions, we analyzed the impact of chilling temperatures on the root microbiome and examined whether microbiome-based analysis might help to identify bacterial strains that could promote growth under these temperatures. We investigated how the maize root microbiome composition changed by means of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing when maize was grown at chilling temperatures in comparison to ambient temperatures by repeatedly cultivating maize in field soil. We identified 12 abundant and enriched bacterial families that colonize maize roots, consisting of bacteria recruited from the soil, whereas seed-derived endophytes were lowly represented. Chilling temperatures modified the root microbiome composition only slightly, but significantly. An enrichment of several chilling-responsive families was detected, of which the Comamonadaceae and the Pseudomonadaceae were the most abundant in the root endosphere of maize grown under chilling conditions, whereas only three were strongly depleted, among which the Streptomycetaceae. Additionally, a collection of bacterial strains isolated from maize roots was established and a selection was screened for growth-promoting effects on juvenile maize grown under chilling temperatures. Two promising strains that promoted maize growth under chilling conditions were identified that belonged to the root endophytic bacterial families, from which the relative abundance remained unchanged by variations in the growth temperature. Our analyses indicate that chilling temperatures affect the bacterial community composition within the maize root endosphere. We further identified two bacterial strains that boost maize growth under chilling conditions. Their identity revealed that analyzing the chilling-responsive families did not help for their identification. As both strains belong to root endosphere enriched families, visualizing and comparing the bacterial diversity in these communities might still help to identify new PGPR strains. Additionally, a strain does not necessarely need to belong to a high abundant family in the root endosphere to provoke a growth-promoting effect in chilling conditions.

14369,A split-root system to assess biocontrol effectiveness and defense-related genetic responses in above-ground tissues during the tripartite interaction Verticillium dahliae-olive-Pseudomonas fluorescens PICF7 in roots,"Background and aims: The olive root endophyte Pseudomonas fluorescens PICF7 is an effective biocontrol agent of Verticillium wilt of olive (VWO). Colonization of olive roots either by strain PICF7 or by Verticillium dahliae triggers differential systemic transcriptomic responses, many of them related with defense-related genes. The aims were to develop an olive split-root system for assessing VWO development and biocontrol effectiveness of strain PICF7 in plants with a divided root architecture, and for evaluating systemic defense responses during this tripartite interaction when strain PICF7 and V. dahliae are spatially separated. Methods: An olive split-root system was generated and disease development, biocontrol effectiveness and systemic genetic responses in these plants upon strain PICF7 and V. dahliae colonization were compared to those reported and observed in olive plants grown under standard conditions (single pots). Specific defense-related genes, previously identified during PICF7- and/or V. dahliae-olive root interactions were selected and their expression patterns assessed in above-ground tissues by real-time qPCR analyses. Results: Symptoms of VWO developed similarly both in split-root and single-root plants. However, even though PICF7 triggered systemic defense responses in aerial tissues prior to the infection by V. dahliae, effective biocontrol was not observed under these experimental conditions. While most of studied genes showed similar expression patterns along time in both systems (i.e. split root and single pot), some of them (e.g. the caffeoyl-O-methyltransferase coding gene) varied depending on whether strain PICF7 and V. dahliae were spatially separated or shared the same compartment. Conclusions: A successful split-root system was generated to investigate genetic events taking place during the tripartite interaction olive-V. dahliae-P. fluorescens PICF7. VWO biocontrol by strain PICF7 must rely on mechanisms other than induction of systemic resistance responses. The expression pattern of specific defense-related olive genes depended on whether or not the biocontrol agent and the pathogen share the same root/soil region. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Cabanás C.G.-L.; Sesmero R.; Valverde-Corredor A.; Javier López-Escudero F.; Mercado-Blanco J.,Plant and Soil,2017,10.1007/s11104-017-3269-y,0.881702431524322,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.986013887279449,0.0139861127205513,0.997429468465787,0.00257053153421272,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2495,Incorporating the process of vertical transmission into understanding of host-symbiont dynamics,"Variation exists in the frequency of obligate, vertically transmitted symbiotic organisms within and among host populations; however, these patterns have not been adequately explained by variable fitness effects of symbionts on their hosts. In this forum, we call attention to another equally important, but overlooked mechanism to maintain variation in the frequency of symbioses in nature: the rate of vertical transmission. On ecological time scales, vertical transmission can affect the equilibrium frequencies of symbionts in host populations, with potential consequences for population and community dynamics. In addition, vertical transmission has the potential to influence the evolution of symbiosis, by affecting the probability of fixation of symbiosis (and therefore the evolution of complexity) and by allowing hosts to sanction against costly symbionts. Here we use grass-epichloae symbioses as a model system to explore the causes and consequences of variation in vertical transmission rates. We identify critical points for symbiont transmission that emerge from considering the host growth cycle devoted to reproduction (asexual vs sexual) and the host capability to maintain homeostasis. We also use information on the process of transmission to predict the environmental factors that would most likely affect transmission rates. Altogether, we aim to highlight the vertical transmission rate as an important process for understanding the ecology and evolution of symbiosis, using grass-epichloae interactions as a case study.","Gundel, PE; Rudgers, JA; Ghersa, CM",OIKOS,2011,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19299.x,0.587318617872027,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999347555759964,6.5244424003547e-4,0.999999999901329,9.867051620204849e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
4994,Evaluation of the development of infective structures and the effect of Beauveria bassiana on the growth of tomato seedlings (Solanum lycopersicum) under high-temperature conditions,"[Objective] The paper aimed to evaluate in vitro development of infective structures of Beauveria spp. strains and their effect on the growth of tomato seedlings (Solanum lycopersicum) under high-temperature conditions. [Methodology] The development of five strains was compared under both optimal and high-temperature conditions (up to 35 degrees C) regarding the production of conidia, mycelium growth, and germination. Subsequently, the effect of the strain with the highest yield on the growth of seedlings of S. lycopersicum, cultivar'Gladiator', was assessed under the same temperature conditions. Furthermore, each strain was identified using PCR amplification of the nuclear intergenic region Bloc and elongation factor EF1-alpha. [Results] Strains were identified as Beauveria bassiana of neotropical lineage. No significant differences were found in the conidia production between treatments (p-value > 0.05), as opposed to mycelial growth. Minor but significant changes were observed in root-to-surface ratios but not in any other evaluated variables, and only for seedlings treated with strain H-31. [Conclusions]The entomopathogenic potential of B. bassiana was determined under environmental stress conditions, such as high temperatures typical of tropical climates.

2707,Analysis of Stored Wheat Grain-Associated Microbiota Reveals Biocontrol Activity among Microorganisms against Mycotoxigenic Fungi,"Wheat grains are colonized by complex microbial communities that have the potential to affect seed quality and susceptibility to disease. Some of the beneficial microbes in these communities have been shown to protect plants against pathogens through antagonism. We evaluated the role of the microbiome in seed health: in particular, against mycotoxin-producing fungi. Amplicon sequencing was used to characterize the seed microbiome and determine if epiphytes and endophytes differ in their fungal and bacterial diversity and community composition. We then isolated culturable fungal and bacterial species and evaluated their antagonistic activity against mycotoxigenic fungi. The most prevalent taxa were found to be shared between the epiphytic and endophytic microbiota of stored wheat seeds. Among the isolated bacteria, Bacillus strains exhibited strong antagonistic properties against fungal pathogens with noteworthy fungal load reduction in wheat grain samples of up to a 3.59 log(10) CFU/g compared to untreated controls. We also found that a strain of the yeast, Rhodotorula glutinis, isolated from wheat grains, degrades and/or metabolizes aflatoxin B-1, one of the most dangerous mycotoxins that negatively affects physiological processes in animals and humans. The mycotoxin level in grain samples was significantly reduced up to 65% in the presence of the yeast strain, compared to the untreated control. Our study demonstrates that stored wheat grains are a rich source of bacterial and yeast antagonists with strong inhibitory and biodegradation potential against mycotoxigenic fungi and the mycotoxins they produce, respectively. Utilization of these antagonistic microorganisms may help reduce fungal and mycotoxin contamination, and potentially replace traditionally used synthetic chemicals.","Solanki, MK; Abdelfattah, A; Sadhasivam, S; Zakin, V; Wisniewski, M; Droby, S; Sionov, E",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2021,10.3390/jof7090781,0.984345540693626,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.983120960031315,0.0168790399686845,0.999999830054502,1.69945497896506e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

19758,Structural basis for a bacterial Pip system plant effector recognition protein.,"A number of plant-associated proteobacteria have LuxR family transcription factors that we refer to as PipR subfamily members. PipR proteins play roles in interactions between bacteria and their plant hosts, and some are important for bacterial virulence of plants. We identified an ethanolamine derivative, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-(2-hydroxyethylamino) acetamide (HEHEAA), as a potent effector of PipR-mediated gene regulation in the plant endophyte Pseudomonas GM79. HEHEAA-dependent PipR activity requires an ATP-binding cassette-type active transport system, and the periplasmic substrate-binding protein (SBP) of that system binds HEHEAA. To begin to understand the molecular basis of PipR system responses to plant factors we crystallized a HEHEAA-responsive SBP in the free- and HEHEAA-bound forms. The SBP, which is similar to peptide-binding SBPs, was in a closed conformation. A narrow cavity at the interface of its two lobes is wide enough to bind HEHEAA, but it cannot accommodate peptides with side chains. The polar atoms of HEHEAA are recognized by hydrogen-bonding interactions, and additional SBP residues contribute to the binding site. This binding mode was confirmed by a structure-based mutational analysis. We also show that a closely related SBP from the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 does not recognize HEHEAA. However, a single amino acid substitution in the presumed effector-binding pocket of the P. syringae SBP converted it to a weak HEHEAA-binding protein. The P. syringae PipR depends on a plant effector for activity, and our findings imply that different PipR-associated SBPs bind different effectors.",Luo S; Coutinho BG; Dadhwal P; Oda Y; Ren J; Schaefer AL; Greenberg EP; Harwood CS; Tong L,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2021,10.1073/pnas.2019462118,0.775461705365493,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.904669612237649,0.0953303877623514,0.999971513756911,2.84862430893762e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

10689,Conformational dimorphism of isochroman-1-ones in the solid state,"Isochroman-1-one derivatives, which are relatives of coumarins, display a broad spectrum of biological activity; therefore, these derivatives attract the attention of chemists. A series of new isochroman-1-ones were prepared by the reaction of benzyl-derived Grignard reagents with acyl chlorides. All of the prepared compounds were characterized using single-crystal X-ray diffraction as well as FT-IR, NMR and MS techniques. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the isochromanones can adopt two distinct conformations in the solid state. For one of the compounds, two polymorphs with unique forms crystallized separately under different temperatures. The packing of all of the examined crystals is stabilized via weak intramolecular C-H center dot center dot center dot pi and/or C-H center dot center dot center dot O interactions.

9636,A New Approach to Produce Resveratrol by Enzymatic Bioconversion,"An enzymatic reaction system was developed and optimized for bioconversion of resveratrol from glucose. Liquid enzyme extracts were prepared from Alternaria sp. MG1, an endophytic fungus from grape, and used directly or after immobilization with sodium alginate. When the enzyme solution was used, efficient production of resveratrol was found within 120 min in a manner that was pH-, reaction time-, enzyme amount-, substrate type-, and substrate concentration-dependent. After the optimization experiments using the response surface methodology, the highest value of resveratrol production (224.40. g/l) was found under the conditions of pH 6.84, 0.35 g/l glucose, 0.02 mg/l coenzyme A, and 0.02 mg/l ATP. Immobilized enzyme extracts could keep high production of resveratrol during recycling use for two to five times. The developed system indicated a potential approach to resveratrol biosynthesis independent of plants and fungal cell growth, and provided a possible way to produce resveratrol within 2 h, the shortest period needed for biosynthesis of resveratrol so far.","Che, JX; Shi, JL; Gao, ZH; Zhang, Y",JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,2016,10.4014/jmb.1512.12084,0.99488091559311,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.797636857184959,0.202363142815041,0.999999994079597,5.92040305669173e-9,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

5773,Biological management of rhizome rot in ginger ( Zingiber officinale) plants and stored ginger seeds,"Two endospore-forming endophytic bacteria (EEB1 A8 and EEB2 B13) were isolated from ginger rhizome collected from the fields of College of Agriculture, Vellayani and identified as Bacillus spp. Their antagonistic potential against Pythium myriotylum, the soft rot pathogen of ginger, was analyzed in vitro by dual culture plate assay and the agar well diffusion method. They tested positive for biocontrol traits such as the production of hydrogen cyanide, siderophore and volatile organic compounds. The bacterial isolates were applied to ginger plants to test biocontrol efficiency against P. myriotylum, individually and in combination with Piriformospora indica, a fungal root endophyte capable of promoting plant growth and enhancing plant defense. A lesser percent disease index (PDI) was observed in plants where the combination of EEB1 A8 and P. indica was applied. The activity of enzymes pertinent to protective mechanisms against pathogens, like peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, super oxide dismutase (SOD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) in the plants were analyzed before challenging, 1st, 3 rd and 5 th day after challenging with pathogen. The values followed the same trend in all treatments as it increased after inoculation up to 3 rd day and then decreased for peroxidase (PO) and SOD. The plants treated with EEB1 A8 and combination of EEB1 A8 and P. indica showed the highest values for the level of defense enzyme production. In a storage study, when ginger seed rhizomes were treated with individual bacterial isolates and as a consortium of both, followed by inoculation with the pathogen P. myriotylum, rhizomes treated with consortium were more tolerant to rhizome rot. Applying endospore-forming bacteria with biocontrol properties is a propitious method for controlling rhizome rot in ginger, in the field and during seed storage.","Nandana, MS; Anith, KN",PLANT SCIENCE TODAY,2024,10.14719/pst.4288,0.99231693024511,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99909432452603,9.0567547396978e-4,0.999999999566464,4.33536317956396e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The seed treatment increased yield significantly in ""Parkland'' where smut in untreated plots was 49%. In ''York'', with 16% smut in plants grown from untreated seed, yield increases were not significant. A higher dosage (227 g) also controlled smut but appeared to cause some toxicity. Seed treatment had no apparent effect on the malting quality of the seed subsequently harvested. Plantvax (2,3-dihydro-5 carboxanilido-6-methyl-l,4-oxathiin-4,4 dioxide) applied as a soil treatment at the rates of 5.6 kg/ha and 11.2 kg/ha also resulted in effective loose smut control in ''York'' barley but did not result in increased yield. There were indications that yield was depressed at the higher rate in ''York'' and at both rates in the variety ''Herta''. There were also indications that treatments with either chemical had a slight effect on height, date of maturity, weight per hectoliter and 1,000-kernel weight.

13949,Effects of AM fungus and grass endophyte on the infection of Lolium perenne by the pathogen Bipolaris sorokinianum in a greenhouse; [温室条件下AM真菌和禾草内生真菌对根腐离蠕孢侵染黑麦草的影响],"In a greenhouse, perennial ryegrass seeds infected with (E+) and without (E-) grass endophyte and pot culture inoculated with (AM) or without (NM) the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus intraradices were used as the grass endophyte and AM treatments. The pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana was inoculated six weeks after seedling emergence by spraying onto leaves and pouring onto soil for root infection, and the same amount of distilled water was applied to non-inoculated (B-) treatments. Two weeks after pathogen inoculation, disease incidence, AM colonization, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic indexes and P content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 concentration of the perennial ryegrass host plants were measured to determine the growth, physiological and biochemical impacts of the pathogen on perennial ryegrass. It was found that the disease incidence of perennial ryegrass inoculated with pathogen ranged from 2.50%-31.25% in leaves. Both AM fungus and grass endophyte reduced the disease incidence, and also promoted P absorption and photosynthesis, and increased the biomass accumulation to some degree. Compared with control treatments, infected with grass endophyte and inoculated with AM fungus decreased disease incidence of perennial ryegrass that inoculated with pathogen in leaves by 32.00%-92.00%. In the all treatments with plants that were infected by pathogen in leaves and roots; the co-colonization of AM fungus and grass endophyte increased net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content, total P content and SOD enzyme activity by 132.25% and 132.17%, 56.00% and 134.48%, 37.69% and 40.77%, 41.51% and 38.17%, 95.65% and 11.72% (P<0.05), as well as decreased MDA and H2O2 concentration by 31.36% and 24.45%, 58.62% and 22.22%, respectively. These results showed that AM fungi and grass endophyte can promote plant growth and improve plant resistance to disease, and the combination of both the symbiont microorganisms provided the greatest benefit. © 2019, Editorial Office of Acta Prataculturae Sinica.

10361,Relation of the soil microbiota of cork oak groves and surrounding grasslands to tree decline,"Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) form low-density silvopastoral systems of great ecosystemic and socioeconomic importance in the Mediterranean Basin, as they provide bark of great industrial value. Since the 1950s, these trees have been increasingly suffering from a deadly disorder known as decline, due to different biotic and abiotic factors. Associated with these forests, grasslands of great pastoral value and as carbon sequestrators develop. The aim of this work was to study the bacterial and fungal diversity present in the soils of healthy and diseased cork oaks (due to decline) and their associated grasslands, an ecosystem whose microbiome has not been studied so far by metagenomics. Soil samples were collected from cork oak forests in southern Spain and their microbial diversity was analyzed by metabarcoding with Illumina MiSeq. With respect to bacterial families, no differences were reported between cork oak forest soils and their associated grasslands, possibly due to the presence of endemic bacteria and similar environmental conditions. However, there were differences in fungal diversity between healthy cork oak forests and their associated grasslands. In the healthy cork oak soils, the families Gemmatimonadaceae and Nocardioidaceae were massively present, while in the diseased soils the fungal genus Geminibasidium was found. Regarding the functional niche, healthy cork oaks presented mainly ectomycorrhizae in their soils, while their associated grasslands presented fungal endophytes, less present in areas with diseased trees. Therefore, fungi, but not bacteria, present in the soils of cork oaks and associated grasslands could play a key role in the presence/absence of decline in cork oaks.","Marcos-Romero, JC; Poveda, J; Diez, JJ",APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,2025,10.1016/j.apsoil.2025.106165,0.901543293106566,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.847300766747533,0.152699233252467,0.999988979958498,1.10200415024408e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
12140,Seed biopriming with potential bioagents influences physiological processes and plant defense enzymes to ameliorate sheath blight induced yield loss in rice (Oryza sativa L.),"Disease management with the use of conventional pesticides has emerged as a major threat to the environment and human health. Moreover, the increasing cost of pesticides and their use in staple crops such as rice is not economically sustainable. The present study utilized a combination of two commercial powder formulations of biocontrol agents, Trichoderma harzianum (Th38) and Pseudomonas fluorescens (Pf28) to induce resistance against sheath blight disease via seed biopriming in basmati rice variety Vasumati and compared the performance with systemic fungicide carbendazim. Sheath blight infection significantly increased the levels of stress indicators such as proline (0.8 to 4.25 folds), hydrogen peroxide (0.89 to 1.61 folds), and lipid peroxidation (2.4 to 2.6 folds) in the infected tissues as compared to the healthy control. On the contrary, biopriming with biocontrol formulation (BCF) significantly reduced the level of stress markers, and substantially enhanced the levels of defense enzymes such as peroxidase (1.04 to 1.18 folds), phenylalanine ammonia lyase (1.02 to 1.17 folds), lipoxygenase (1.2 to 1.6 folds), and total phenolics (74% to 83%) as compared to the infected control. Besides, improved photosynthesis (48% to 59%) and nitrate reductase activity (21% to 42%) showed a positive effect on yield and biomass, which compensated disease induced losses in bio-primed plants. Conversely, the comparative analysis of the efficacy levels of BCF with carbendazim revealed BCF as a potential and eco-friendly alternative for reducing disease impact and maintaining higher yield in rice under sheath blight infection.","Das, S; Kundu, S; Meena, K; Jha, RK; Varma, A; Bahuguna, RN; Tripathi, S",WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY,2023,10.1007/s11274-023-03576-6,0.832860763168518,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.887170888294614,0.112829111705386,0.999992162824927,7.83717507346626e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
10994,Production of methyl oleate by direct addition of fermented solid Penicillium sumatrense and Aspergillus fumigatus,"This work objective was to use different lipases in the methyl oleate synthesis. Endophytic fungi strains of Penicillium sumatrense and Aspergillus fumigatus were isolated from castor leaves (Ricinus communis L.) in order to acquire lipases through solid-state fermentation, using sunflower seeds as substrate. Following this, the fermented solid went through the process of obtaining the crude extract, drying or immobilization. From the enzymatic preparations, esterification reactions were performed, using oleic acid as a substrate. The enzyme immobilization and extraction resulted in loss of hydrolytic activity and reduction of esterification efficiency, showing about 70-80% of maximum conversion in 12 h of reaction. The fermented solid showed 90% conversion after 8 h reaction and after conditions optimization, it resulted in 100% conversion. The produced enzymes presented themselves to be suitable for reutilization, the A. fumigatus enzyme showed a half-life of 14 reuse cycles. The fermented solid addition have some advantages when compared to others enzymatic preparations such as lower activity loss, reduced obtainment costs and possibility for reutilization.

11996,Marvellous Muscodor spp.: Update on Their Biology and Applications,"Nearly 20 years ago, the first report appeared on the discovery of a novel genus-Muscodor. This organism was isolated as an endophyte from a cinnamon tree that had been introduced to Honduras from Sri Lanka in the early part of the last century. Characteristically, the original Muscodor albus, and all of its species isolated since that time are non-spore producers and each one exudes a characteristic spectrum of volatile bioactive compounds. The majority have a whitish mycelium, which is sometimes coiling, intertwined and decorated with variously shaped structures. Presently, there are at least 22 type species known/documented and each has been described as an endophyte from various plant families with widely varying habitats. An enormous variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are produced by Muscodor spp. and some of these include esters, acids, aldehydes, ketones, aromatics, alkanes, alcohols, nitrosamides and terpenoids. The VOCs are both inhibitory and lethal to a wide variety of fungi and bacteria including some major pathogens of plants and humans. Interestingly, in almost all cases studied, no one compound by itself can mimic the bioactivity of the complete gas mixture, suggesting that the volatiles are acting in a synergistic manner and this has been tested with individual as well as the VOCs in various mixtures and concentrations. This review will discuss some of the recent findings in all aspects of this unique fungal genus whilst at the same time pointing out some of the major questions that remain about its biology, ecology and its applications in agriculture, medicine and other sectors. Most importantly, the authors provide arguments supporting the claim that Muscodor is taxonomically distinct from Induratia, a recently proposed change to its nomenclature.","Saxena, S; Strobel, GA",MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,2021,10.1007/s00248-020-01644-0,0.982454333008915,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996694122317385,0.00330587768261548,0.999999917293933,8.27060668839863e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16272,"Endophytic fungi from Dichrocephala integrifolia: Diversity, antifungal properties, enzymatic activities, and plant growth promotion","Dichrocephala integrifolia is a wild medicinal plant utilised in traditional healing and Ayurveda to cope up with several health issues by various groups of people around the world. Medicinal plants are associated with diverse fungal endophytes with potential bioactive properties. In this investigation, 26 fungal endophytes were isolated from D. integrifolia and three sterile forms using the Petri plate culture method. The endophytic isolation rate was highest for inflorescence (35.97%) and lowest for stem (15.61%). The highest colonization frequency was shown by F. solani (8.37%) and the lowest by Sterile morphotype 3 (1.36%). Out of the four plant parts, inflorescence was found to be highly infected, displaying an infection rate of 93.43% and the least infection occurred in the stem with 45%. The maximum number of isolated endophytic fungi belongs to the class Sordariomycetes, with a relative occurrence (%) of 71.72%. The Simpson’s diversity index reveals that the leaf endophytes were more diverse (0.94). Qualitative antifungal activity of the sporulating isolates against Curvularia lunata has shown that the maximum number of endophytes possessed Class 3 antagonism. Four isolates were selected based on screening of their antagonistic activity and their antifungal inhibition was calculated against nine fungal phytopathogens. Maximum inhibition (100%) was shown by Trichoderma sp. 2 (S2B2) against Alternaria alternata, A. brassicicola, Colletotrichum capsici, C. lunata, and Ustilaginoidea virens and least inhibition by Gliocladium sp. 1 (19.78%) against C. lunata. The four isolates were found to produce protease, lipase, amylase and cellulase enzymes. The isolates produced ammonia and hydrogen cyanide, but none of the isolates could solubilize phosphate. Potent biocontrol agents are much needed to replace synthetic chemicals and restore soil microflora. © 2024, Informatics Publishing Limited.
