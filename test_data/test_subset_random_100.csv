21162,"Identification of endophytic fungi isolated from licorice, a traditional Chinese medicine plant","Licorice is the most important herb used in the traditional Chinese (TCM) medicine. It was used to treat individuals with gastric or duodenal ulcers, bronchitis, cough, arthritis, adrenal insufficiency and allergies. The active substances and secondary metabolites from Licorice roots may be associated with a specific microbial agent. It is believed that many endophytic fungi from medically important plants can produce the same or similar secondary metabolites as the plant. Endophytic fungi are also thought to play an important role in plant communities by increasing fitness of the host plant. To clarify whether endophytic fungi are found in the licorice, fungi were isolated from Licorice root and characterized morphologically and using molecular identification. The morphological examination showed that the endophytic fungi from Licorice were Aspergillus and Chaetomium species. Further identification was achieved by sequence similarity comparison and phylogenetic analysis of the ITS regions. Results showed that strains L10L2 and L4 belong to Aspergillus species, L3 identified to Chaetomium. A neighbor-joining tree showed the relationships between the isolate's sequence data and the closest identified relatives from GenBank. These fungi could have significance as a source of pharmaceutical natural products.",Dong Y.; Wang L.; Hu J.; Zhao K.,Journal of Pure and Applied Microbiology,2015,NA,0.958699895751854,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Absence,Absence,0.152180168400964,0.847819831599036,0.999851050106594,1.4894989340574e-4,Absence,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Absence,Absence
3179,"VESICULAR-ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI, PARTICULARLY GLOMUS-TENUE, IN VENEZUELAN BROMELIAD EPIPHYTES","The mycorrhizal status of water-impounding ''tank'' bromeliad epiphytes from three locales differing in altitude and moisture regime within Venezuelan cloud forest was examined. Species of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi found in arboreal soils were compared to VAM fungi found in terrestrial soils. Sixteen of the 19 epiphytes examined for the presence of VAM fungi had roots with infection stages; 14 of these specimens showed growth of the fine endophyte Glomus tenue. Fine endophyte was the only VAM fungus found associated with epiphytes in the driest locale studied, while coarse VAM fungi (Gigaspora and Scutellospora spp.) were found at sampling locales receiving more moisture. Root infection was usually composed of intercellular hyphae and peletons, few arbuscules were observed. However, abundant extracellular hyphae were often observed tangled about roots in arboreal soil. It is concluded that epiphytic bromeliads probably benefit, at least periodically, from VAM fungi scavenging for sporadically available nutrients in arboreal soils. Glomus tenue may be particularly important as a colonizing VAM fungus in drier sites of Venezuelan cloud forest. The species composition of VAM fungi in arboreal soils was different to that of terrestrial soils sampled directly under epiphytic bromeliad perches, suggesting that VAM fungi species associated with bromeliads are dispersed to their hosts by vagile animal vectors.","RABATIN, SC; STINNER, BR; PAOLETTI, MG",MYCORRHIZA,1993,10.1007/BF00203245,0.95724497117749,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999739683256439,2.6031674356082e-4,0.999999999920255,7.97449883904733e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16436,"Isolation and molecular identification of endophytic fungi associated with Campomanesia adamantium, a Brazilian Cerrado plant; [Identificação molecular e caracterização da diversidade de espécies cultiváveis de fungos endofíticos associados à Campomanesia Adamantium]","This work presents the isolation of endophytic fungi from the leaves of Campomanesia adamantium (Cambess.) O. Berg (Myrtaceae), a native species found in Brazil and popularly known as “guabiroba-do-campo”, with abundant distribution in the Brazilian Cerrado. It has been popularly used for its anti-rheumatic, anti-inflammatory, antidiarrheal, blood cholesterol-reducing, urinary antiseptic, and depurative properties. Theese fungi are microorganisms that live inside higher plants, at least for a period of their life cycle, occupying the intercellular spaces of plant tissues such as leaves and stems. These fungi are harmless to the host plant, and their secondary metabolites promote protection, regulate growth, combat bacteria, viruses, and fungi, and promote resistance to abiotic stress, as well as insecticidal effects. Endophytic fungi associated with the leaves of C. adamantium were isolated using the culture medium isolation technique. After growth, the fungi were divided into groups based on morphotypes. Fungal genomic DNA was extracted, and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted to amplify the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 regions of rRNA, and the nucleotide sequences obtained were compared with those available in the GenBank database for molecular identification of the isolates. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA 11 software. The results showed representatives of the Ascomycota phylum, and it was possible to identify at the genus level 18 fungi of the genera Colletotrichum, Diaporthe, Epicoccum, and Neofusicoccum. © 2024, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

4574,In silico analysis of metatranscriptomic data from the Antarctic vascular plant Colobanthus quitensis: Responses to a global warming scenario through changes in fungal gene expression levels,"Maritime Antarctica is one of the most stressful environments for plant life worldwide. However, two vascular plant species (Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis) have been able to colonize this hostile environment. Although it has been proposed that C. quitensis possesses tolerance mechanisms and adaptations allowing survival and growth under such stressful conditions, the underlying molecular/transcriptional mechanisms are currently unknown. Furthermore, the impact of global warming on the endophytic and epiphytic organisms associated with C. quitensis remains unclear. Here, a metatranscriptomic approach was used to determine the effect of an in situ simulated global warming scenario on C. quitensis plants. We found a large number of differentially expressed genes successfully annotated (2,997), suggesting that climate change modulates the metatranscriptome of C. quitensis plants and associated endophytes and epiphytes. Interestingly, 50.5% and 26.8% of up- and down-regulated genes, respectively, are from non-plant species (putative endophytic and epiphytic organisms, such as fungi). Interestingly, Gene Ontology analysis pointed out several biological processes differentially enriched in non-plant microorganisms associated with C. quitensis grown in a simulated global warming scenario. Taken together, these results suggest that climatic drivers are shaping plant-microorganism interactions, and that endophytes/epiphytes may play crucial roles in plant adaptation to extreme environmental conditions.

These fungi often have a wide host range, which can include native and introduced hosts in an area. Multi-locus DNA sequence identification on a recent collection of Botryosphaeriaceae from Eucalyptus grandis and Syzygium cordatum trees in South Africa revealed cross-infectivity of several species, novel host associations and new country reports. Neofusicoccum eucalyptorum, Neofusicoccum kwambonambiense, Neofusicoccum parvum, Neofusicoccum australe and Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae were identified from both tree species, with L pseudotheobromae and N. eucalyptorum isolated for the first time from S. cord atom, similar to N. kwambonambiense from Eucalyptus. This also represents the first report of L. pseudotheobromae from South Africa. Botryosphaeriaceae species on Eucalyptus species and S. cordatum are fairly well known from South Africa. However, this study revealed new associations, indicating that conclusions should not be generalized and that more intensive sampling from different areas and over time is likely to reveal distinct species and host association patterns.

12243,Evaluating the Effects of Epichloë Fungal Endophytes of Perennial Ryegrass on the Feeding Behaviour and Life History of Rhopalosiphum padi,"Simple Summary Endophytic fungi in pasture grasses help the plant resist unfavourable biotic and abiotic conditions. Despite some well-documented aspects of how these fungi confer resistance to insects, some mechanisms are not well known. In this work, we measured the effects of such endophytes on aphids, an important pest group. We measured aphid feeding activity and life-history effects to further understand the mode of action of endophyte-perennial ryegrass systems. We were able to demonstrate that, in some cases, fungal endophytes significantly deterred feeding, but in other cases, feeding was not affected, and yet high mortality was observed. This suggests a complex scenario of interactions between compounds in the endophyte-perennial-ryegrass-aphid system. Our study shows that fungal endophytes have the potential to improve sustainable aphid control by decreasing the use of insecticide sprays.Abstract The bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.), is an economically significant pest of pasture grasses, the latter being capable of hosting several fungal endophyte-perennial ryegrass symbiota rich in alkaloids and toxic to vertebrates and invertebrates. Measuring aphid feeding behaviour can provide insights into the effectiveness and mode of action of different fungal endophytes. This study investigated the effects of different Epichlo & euml;-perennial ryegrass symbiota on the feeding behaviour of R. padi using the electrical penetration graph technique while also assessing the aphid life history. In most cases, endophytes had significant feeding deterrence and paired fecundity and mortality effects. But, in some instances, endophytes with the highest aphid mortality did not significantly deter feeding, suggesting a more complicated scenario of interactions between the relative concentration of metabolites, e.g., host plant defence response metabolites and alkaloids, and/or physical changes to leaf morphology. Overall, this study sheds light on the mode of action of Epichlo & euml; endophytes against aphids and highlights the importance of Epichlo & euml;-perennial ryegrass symbiota in the management of insect pests such as aphids in pasture-based grazing systems.","Collinson, NP; Giri, K; Kaur, J; Spangenberg, G; Malipatil, M; Mann, RC; Valenzuela, I",INSECTS,2024,10.3390/insects15100744,0.929429737666255,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99636539048885,0.00363460951114991,0.999999993994278,6.00572169773272e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5852,Regional Differences in the Structure of Juglans nigra Phytobiome Reflect Geographical Differences in Thousand Cankers Disease Severity,"Thousand cankers disease threatens Juglans nigra (Eastern Black Walnut) in urban and natural landscapes. Incidence and severity of thousand cankers disease is higher in the host's introduced range in the western United States. We hypothesized that these differences are driven partly by geographical variation in the host phytobiome due to its roles in host stress tolerance, nutrient acquisition, and defense. To evaluate the role of the phytobiome in mediating thousand cankers disease, we characterized the J. nigra phytobiome of diseased and healthy trees in portions of its native (Indiana and Tennessee) and introduced (Washington) ranges. Grafted clones present in each state and open-pollinated populations were sampled. DNA was extracted from soil and branch (caulosphere) tissues and internal transcribed spacer and 16s regions were sequenced for characterization of fungal and bacterial communities. We found that microbial communities in the caulosphere and soil differ between native and introduced ranges of J. nigra and harbor different mutualistic and pathogenic microorganisms. Additionally, caulosphere microbial communities were more species rich and diverse in the native range of J. nigra, suggesting greater levels of functional redundancy and multifunctionality in the native-range phytobiome compared with the introduced range. We also found higher network complexity in the caulosphere of trees in the introduced range and evidence for two alternative stable community states associated with diseased and healthy trees. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that geographical variation in thousand cankers risease incidence and severity is partially driven by differences in the phytobiome of J. nigra in its introduced and native ranges.","Onufrak, AJ; Williams, GM; Klingeman, WE; Cregger, MA; Klingeman, DM; DeBruyn, JM; Ginzel, MD; Hadziabdic, D",PHYTOBIOMES JOURNAL,2020,10.1094/PBIOMES-05-20-0044-R,0.988686725053807,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996101384142134,0.00389861585786589,0.999999984497258,1.55027417569897e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3173,Cultivars and Production Environments Shape Shoot Endophyte Profiles of Boxwood with Different Blight Resistance,"Phyllosphere colonizers, including bacteria and fungi, are critical for plant growth and health. However, how they are affected simultaneously by the host plant cultivar, local environment, and agricultural practices was not well understood. We used boxwood, an iconic landscape plant and a major evergreen shrub crop in the United States nursery industry, as a model plant and sequenced 16S rRNA and ITS amplicons to examine the assemblages of endophytic bacteria and fungi in the shoots of four cultivars representing three levels of boxwood blight resistance under two distinct climates and production systems in Oregon and Virginia. Cultivar and local environment were the two main drivers shaping the composition and structure of the boxwood endophytic microbial community, particularly the fungal community. Three bacterial and seven fungal genera were consistently identified with high prevalence and abundance as the core taxa from four cultivars and two locations across three sampling times. The microbial composition varied among the levels of boxwood blight resistance, and taxa specific to the tolerant cultivar were fewer compared to the susceptible one. Identification of these microbial indicators, along with the core taxa, is foundational for developing a microbiome-based plant breeding program and a systems approach to improve boxwood health and production under a changing climate.Copyright (c) 2024 The Author(s).

The aim of this study was to determine the mycorrhizal dependency of Arachis hypogea L. to different P levels and to evaluate the development of host and endophyte after colonization. A greenhouse experiment was carried out in completely randomized design, with two mycorrhizal fungi species (Gigaspora rosea and Glomus clarum) and a control without the fungus, and also with different P levels applied to the soil (0, 75, 150 and 250 mg kg(-1) of P). After 50 days of groundnuts germination, there were evaluated dry weight (DW), root colonization, number of spores in the soil, mycorrhizal dependency and available P. The peanut plants showed mycorrhizal dependency when inoculated with G. rosea in low supply of P and for G. clarum only in the absence of the nutrient. The inoculation with G. rosea produced higher DW with 75 mg kg(-1) of P (7.2 g per plant), whereas there was an increase in the accumulation of P in shoots up to the highest dose (250 mg kg(-1)) of P. Although G. clarum provided higher number of spores and root colonization ratio, it had the lowest plant growth and also lower P use efficiency by shoots.","Hippler, FWR; Moreira, M",BRAGANTIA,2013,10.1590/S0006-87052013005000023,0.93713602796727,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999937572424063,6.24275759367448e-5,0.999999957233063,4.27669365477001e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2730,Unearthing the power of microbes as plant microbiome for sustainable agriculture,"In recent years, research into the complex interactions and crosstalk between plants and their associated microbiota, collectively known as the plant microbiome has revealed the pivotal role of microbial communities for promoting plant growth and health. Plants have evolved intricate relationships with a diverse array of microorganisms inhabiting their roots, leaves, and other plant tissues. This microbiota mainly includes bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoans, and viruses, forming a dynamic and interconnected network within and around the plant. Through mutualistic or cooperative interactions, these microbes contribute to various aspects of plant health and development. The direct mechanisms of the plant microbiome include the enhancement of plant growth and development through nutrient acquisition. Microbes have the ability to solubilize essential minerals, fix atmospheric nitrogen, and convert organic matter into accessible forms, thereby augmenting the nutrient pool available to the plant. Additionally, the microbiome helps plants to withstand biotic and abiotic stresses, such as pathogen attacks and adverse environmental conditions, by priming the plant's immune responses, antagonizing phytopathogens, and improving stress tolerance. Furthermore, the plant microbiome plays a vital role in phytohormone regulation, facilitating hormonal balance within the plant. This regulation influences various growth processes, including root development, flowering, and fruiting. Microbial communities can also produce secondary metabolites, which directly or indirectly promote plant growth, development, and health. Understanding the functional potential of the plant microbiome has led to innovative agricultural practices, such as microbiome-based biofertilizers and biopesticides, which harness the power of beneficial microorganisms to enhance crop yields while reducing the dependency on chemical inputs. In the present review, we discuss and highlight research gaps regarding the plant microbiome and how the plant microbiome can be used as a source of single and synthetic bioinoculants for plant growth and health.","Mukherjee, A; Singh, BN; Kaur, S; Sharma, M; de Araújo, ASF; Pereira, APD; Morya, R; Puopolo, G; Melo, VMM; Verma, JP",MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH,2024,10.1016/j.micres.2024.127780,0.888916951414955,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999409712669536,5.9028733046375e-4,0.999999977950381,2.20496194636155e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

7126,Endophytic fungus Penicillium steckii DF33 promoted tanshinones biosynthesis in Salvia miltiorrhiza by regulating the expression of CYP450 genes,"Salvia miltiorrhiza, a prominent traditional Chinese medicinal resource, has been extensively employed in the management of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular ailments. Ensuring the consistency of S. miltiorrhiza raw materials revolves around the imperative task of maintaining stable tanshinones content and composition. An effective approach in this regard involves the utilization of endophytic fungi as inducers. Within this context, our study spotlights an endophytic fungus, Penicillium steckii DF33, isolated from the roots of S. miltiorrhiza. Remarkably, this fungus has demonstrated a significant capacity to boost the biosynthesis and accumulation of tanshinones. The primary objective of this investigation is to elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanism by which DF33 enhances and regulates the biosynthesis and accumulation of tanshinones. This is achieved through its influence on the differential expression of crucial CYP450 genes within the S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots system. The results revealed that the DF33 elicitor not only promotes the growth of hairy roots but also enhances the accumulation of tanshinones. Notably, the content of cryptotanshinone was reached 1.6452 +/- 0.0925 mg g  1, a fourfold increase compared to the control group. Our qRT-PCR results further demonstrate that the DF33 elicitor significantly up-regulates the expression of most key enzyme genes (GGPPS, CPS1, KSL1, CYP76AH1, CYP76AH3, CYP76AK1, CYP71D411) involved in the tanshinone biosynthesis pathway. This effect is particularly pronounced in certain critical CYP450 genes and Tanshinone IIA synthase (SmTIIAS), with their expression levels peaking at 7 days or 14 days, respectively. In summary, endophytic P. steckii DF33 primarily enhances tanshinone biosynthesis by elevating the expression levels of pivotal enzyme genes associated with the modification and transformation stages within the tanshinone biosynthesis pathway. These findings underscore the potential of employing plant probiotics, specifically endophytic and root-associated microbes, to facilitate the biosynthesis and transformation of vital constituents in medicinal plants, and this approach holds promise for enhancing the quality of traditional Chinese medicinal materials.","Lv, XM; Zhang, WY; Chu, SY; Zhang, HH; Wu, YQ; Zhu, Y; Yang, DF; Zhu, YH; Mans, DRA; Chen, HM; Liang, ZS",GENE,2024,10.1016/j.gene.2023.148094,0.984271152530454,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.356850336547254,0.643149663452746,0.999253715755057,7.4628424494327e-4,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

6267,Comparison of Fungal Genera Isolated from Cucumber Plants and Rhizosphere Soil by Using Various Cultural Media,"Plant endophytic fungi and rhizosphere soil fungi are often reported as biocontrol agents against plant pathogens or with plant growth promotion potential. Four treatments were performed in field and greenhouse experiments where cucumber plants were inoculated with Trichoderma harzianum and Fusarium oxysporum in 2022. The roots, stems and leaves of cucumber plants and their rhizosphere soil were collected twice individually from the field and greenhouse for isolation of cucumber endophytic and rhizosphere soil fungi. All fungal strains were identified through sequence similarity of the ITS1-5.8s-ITS2 rDNA region. The potato dextrose agar (PDA) media yielded the highest number of genera isolated from cucumber plants, rhizosphere soil and both compared to other media. There were no significant differences among the four media for the isolation of all cucumber endophytic fungi. However, in the roots, the number of endophytic fungi isolated by MRBA was significantly higher than that isolated on malt extract agar (MEA), while in the stems, the number of fungi isolated with PDA was significantly higher than that isolated with Martin's rose bengal agar medium (MRBA). PDA had significantly higher isolation efficiency for the rhizosphere soil fungi than MRBA.

15158,Coptischinensis Franch root rot infection disrupts microecological balance of rhizosphere soil and endophytic microbiomes,"Introduction: The ecological balance of the plant microbiome, as a barrier against pathogens, is very important for host health. Coptis chinensis is one of the important medicinal plants in China. In recent years, Illumina Miseq high-throughput sequencing technology was frequently used to analyze root rot pathogens and the effects of root rot on rhizosphere microorganisms of C. chinensis. But the effects of root rot infection on rhizosphere microecological balance of C. chinensis have received little attention. Methods: In this study, Illumina Miseq high-throughput sequencing technology was applied to analyze the impact on microbial composition and diversity of C. chinensis by root rot. Results: The results showed that root rot infection had significant impact on bacterial α-diversity in rhizome samples, but had no significant effect on that in leaf samples and rhizosphere soil samples, while root rot infection exhibited significant impact on the fungal α-diversity in leaf samples and rhizosphere soil samples, and no significant impact on that in rhizome samples. PCoA analysis showed that the root rot infection had a greater impact on the fungal community structure in the rhizosphere soil, rhizome, and leaf samples of C. chinensis than on the bacterial community structure. Root rot infection destroyed the microecological balance of the original microbiomes in the rhizosphere soil, rhizome, and leaf samples of C. chinensis, which may also be one of the reasons for the serious root rot of C. chinensis. Discussion: In conclusion, our findings suggested that root rot infection with C. chinensis disrupts microecological balance of rhizosphere soil and endophytic microbiomes. The results of this study can provide theoretical basis for the prevention and control of C. chinensis root rot by microecological regulation.

6649,Endophytic Fungi from Marine Macroalgae in Nova Scotia,"Marine macroalgae are a polyphyletic group of photosynthetic eukaryotes and play critical roles in oxygen production, as primary producers, and in providing physical habitat structure. They harbor diverse microbial communities, including mutualistic, commensalistic, and parasitic fungi. These fungi may be obligately or facultatively marine and symbiotic. In this investigation, we isolated endophytic algicolous fungi from marine macroalgae collected from 5 intertidal sites in Nova Scotia. Fungi were cultured from surface-sterilized algal tissue and identified using ITS rDNA barcoding. From 21 marine macroalgal species collected, 11 algal species harbored endophytic fungi. We identified 23 endophytic algicolous fungi from the Bay of Fundy and Atlantic coasts of Nova Scotia.

16898,First Report of Damping-Off on African Daisy Caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG-4 in Italy.,"Osteospermum (African Daisy or Cape Daisy) is a genus belonging to the Calendulae with a large number of perennial plant species. In February of 2007, a severe damping-off occurred on 3- to 4-month-old potted cuttings of Osteospermum 'Impassion Rose Purple', 'Impassion White', 'Impassion Purple', and 'Impassion White Rose' cultivated in a nursery in eastern Sicily. More than 30% of the plants were infected. Disease symptoms consisted of extensive water-soaked lesions at the base of the stem followed by wilt and collapse of the plant. Isolations from diseased tissues on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with streptomycin sulfate at 100 mg/l consistently recovered a fungus with morphological characteristics of Rhizoctonia solani. Fungal colonies were initially white, turned brown after 2 to 3 days, and produced irregularly shaped, brown sclerotia after 1 week. Microscopic examination revealed that hyphae had right angle branching patterns, were constricted at the base of the branch near the union with main hyphae, and septate near the constriction. The number of nuclei per hyphal cell was determined on cultures grown at 25°C on 2% water agar in petri plates. Mycelium was stained with 0.5% aniline blue solution (4) and examined with a microscope at ×400. The hyphal cells were all multinucleate. Anastomosis groups were determined by pairing isolates (3) with tester isolates of AG-1 IA, AG-2-2-1, AG-2-2IIIB, AG-2-2IV, AG-3, AG-4, AG-5, AG-6, and AG-11. Anastomosis was observed only with tester isolates of AG-4, giving C2 reactions (1) at a high frequency. The identification of group AG-4 within R. solani had been obtained by electrophoretic patterns of pectic enzymes (polygalacturonases) in vertical pectin-acrylamide gel stained with ruthenium red (2). All isolates of R. solani collected from infected plants were paired in all combinations on PDA plus 1% activated charcoal and examined for somatic interaction. All paired colonies merged without producing visible tufts of aerial mycelium. Absence of tufts and the lack of formation of heterokaryon at the hyphal interaction zone indicated that all isolates belonged to the same mating type with the same mating alleles (3). Pathogenicity tests were performed by placing plugs of PDA from 5-day-old mycelial cultures in the soil near the base of the stem on 20 potted, healthy, 2-month-old cuttings of Osteospermum cv. Impassion Rose Purple. The same number of plants treated with 1/cm2 PDA plugs served as controls. Following inoculation, all plants were maintained in a growth chamber at 25°C and 95% relative humidity on a 12-h fluorescent light/dark regimen. Wilt symptoms and lesions at the base of stem identical to those observed in the nursery developed 7 days after inoculation, and all inoculated plants died within 20 days. Control plants remained symptomless. R. solani AG-4 was consistently reisolated from symptomatic tissues, completing Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of damping-off on the genus Osteospermum caused by R. solani. References: (1) D. E. Carling.

18562,Isolation of plant-growth-promoting and metal-resistant cultivable bacteria from Arthrocnemum macrostachyum in the Odiel marshes with potential use in phytoremediation.,"Arthrocnemum macrostachyum is a halophyte naturally growing in southwest coasts of Spain that can tolerate and accumulate heavy metals. A total of 48 bacteria (30 endophytes and 18 from the rhizosphere) were isolated from A. macrostachyum growing in the Odiel River marshes, an ecosystem with high levels of contamination. All the isolates exhibited plant-growth-promoting (PGP) properties and most of them were multiresistant to heavy metals. Although the presence of heavy metals reduced the capability of the isolates to exhibit PGP properties, several strains were able to maintain their properties or even enhance them in the presence of concrete metals. Two bacterial consortia with the best-performing endophytic or rhizospheric strains were selected for further experiments. Bacterial inoculation accelerated germination of A. macrostachyum seeds in both the absence and presence of heavy metals. These results suggest that inoculation of A. macrostachyum with the selected bacteria could ameliorate plant establishment and growth in contaminated marshes.",Navarro-Torre S; Mateos-Naranjo E; Caviedes MA; Pajuelo E; Rodríguez-Llorente ID,Marine pollution bulletin,2016,10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.06.070,0.947707525967912,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.506313427669682,0.493686572330318,0.999985356649485,1.46433505154864e-5,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
19560,"Effects of rare earth elements on bacteria in rhizosphere, root, phyllosphere and leaf of soil-rice ecosystem.","The effects of rare earth mining on rice biomass, rare earth element (REE) content and bacterial community structure was studied through pot experiment. The research shows that the REE content in rice roots, shoots and grains was significantly positive correlated with that in soil, and the dry weight of rice roots, shoots and grains was highly correlated with soil physical and chemical properties, nutrient elements and REE contents; The exploitation of rare earth minerals inhibited a-diversity of endophytic bacteria in rhizosphere, root, phyllosphere and leaf of rice, significantly reduced the abundance index, OTU number, Chao, Ace index and also significantly reduced the diversity index-Shannon index, and also reduced uniformity index: Pielou's evenness index, which caused β-diversity of bacteria to be quite different. The exploitation of rare earth minerals reduces the diversity of bacteria, but forms dominant bacteria, such as Burkholderia, Bacillus, Buttiauxella, Acinetobacter, Bradyrhizobium, Candida koribacter, which can degrade the pollutants formed by exploitation of rare earth minerals, alleviate the compound pollution of rare earth and ammonia nitrogen, and also has the function of fixing nitrogen and resisting rare earth stress; The content of soil available phosphorus in no-mining area is lower, and the dominant bacteria of Pantoea formed in such soil, which has the function of improving soil phosphorus availability. Rare earth elements and physical and chemical properties of soil affect the community structure of bacteria in rhizosphere and phyllosphere of rice, promote the parallel movement of some bacteria in rhizosphere, root, phyllosphere and leaf of rice, promote the construction of community structure of bacteria in rhizosphere and phyllosphere of rice, give full play to the growth promoting function of Endophytes, and promote the growth of rice. The results showed that the exploitation of rare earth minerals has formed the dominant endophytic bacteria of rice and ensured the yield of rice in the mining area, however, the mining of mineral resources causes the compound pollution of rare earth and ammonia nitrogen, which makes REE content of rice in mining area significantly higher than that in non-mining area, and the excessive rare earth element may enter the human body through the food chain and affect human health, so the food security in the REE mining area deserves more attention.",Zhang X; Hu Z; Pan H; Bai Y; Hu Y; Jin S,Scientific reports,2022,10.1038/s41598-022-06003-2,0.942448792640999,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.907554059219123,0.0924459407808766,0.999998835485163,1.16451483711533e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2439,Exemplifying endophytes of banana (Musa paradisiaca) for their potential role in growth stimulation and management of Fusarium oxysporumf. spcubense causing panama wilt,"In the present study, potentiality of endophytic microorganisms such as Rigidiporus vinctus AAU EF, Trichoderma reesei UH EF, and Sphingobacterium tabacisoli UH EB in the management of panama wilt and growth promotion of banana was assessed through artificial inoculation. During the study, a total of 220 bacterial and 110 fungal endophytes were isolated from root, pseudostem, and leaf samples of banana, and they were evaluated against Fusarium oxysporumf. spcubense causing panama wilt. Out of total 330 bacterial and fungal endophytes, only five endophytes exhibited antagonism against Fusarium oxysporumf. spcubense, out of which only three isolates, namely Trichoderma reesei UH EF, Rigidiporus vinctus AAU EF, and Sphingobacterium tabacisoli UH EB, produced indole acetic acid, siderophore, and hydrogen cyanide, except one bacterial strain Sphingobacterium tabacisoli UH EB which does not produce hydrogen cyanide. Furthermore, these three endophytes were identified through cultural and morphological characteristics as well as by the sequencing internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 16S rRNA gene sequences analysis for bacteria, respectively. The response of host plant to endophyte inoculation was assessed by measuring the change in four growth parameters; plant height, pseudo stem girth (diameter), number of roots, and total number of leaves. The application of endophytes, irrespective of isolate and treatment type promoted the overall growth of the plant growth when compared with diseased plants with significant higher values recorded for all parameters assessed. The endophytes reported as growth promoters were found to have significant inhibition effect on Foc which can evidenced with lowest AUDPC values and epidemic rate at 99.09 units(2) and 0.02 unit/day, respectively.","Savani, AK; Bhattacharyya, A; Boro, RC; Dinesh, K; Swamy, JCN",FOLIA MICROBIOLOGICA,2021,10.1007/s12223-021-00853-5,0.994177689975192,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992901954102028,0.00709804589797234,0.999999999992109,7.89135423673315e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11971,Phytotoxic effects of benzimidazole fungicides on bedding plants,"Benzimidazoles are effective and widely used fungicides, but they may be phytotoxic. We studied the effects of a single drench application of six benzimidazoles and one acetanilide fungicide on photosynthetic gas exchange, growth, development, and nutrient levels of four species of bedding plants in twenty growth-chamber and four greenhouse studies, Daily carbon gain and carbon-use efficiency were calculated from continuous crop gas-exchange measurements in the growth chambers, The maximum labeled rate of Benlate DF caused a 7- to 10-day decrease in net photosynthesis and daily carbon gain in transplants of all species, It also caused pronounced interveinal chlorosis and a 2- to 3-day delay in flowering, Growth of Benlate DF-treated plants was reduced more at high (90%) than at low (60% to 80%) relative humidity, Benlate DF had severe effects on 2-week-old petunia (Petunia xhybrida) seedlings in plug flats, reducing photosynthesis 25% to 57%. Cleary's 3336 WP decreased photosynthesis in some trials, Benlate DF reduced photosynthesis within 24 hours, but 3336 WP effects did not become apparent until 1 week after the treatment, This suggests different modes of inhibition, 3336 WP also caused leaf-tip and marginal chlorosis in impatiens (Impatiens wallerana). Mertect 340-F was extremely phytotoxic but is not labeled for drench applications (it was included because of its chemical similarity to other benzimidazoles), The only benzimidazole fungicide that did not reduce photosynthesis was Derosal, but it caused slight interveinal chlorosis in some studies with petunia, Benlate DF and Derosal decreased leaf Ca levels, Subdue (or metalaxyl), an acetanilide fungicide, did not affect photosynthesis or cause any visual symptoms, Our results indicate that some benzimidazole fungicides can cause growth reductions and visual damage in bedding plants.","vanIersel, MW; Bugbee, B",JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE,1996,10.21273/JASHS.121.6.1095,0.944318727450236,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999492824535873,5.071754641275e-4,0.999999940505091,5.94949091103913e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

1897,Foliar bacteria and soil fertility mediate seedling performance: a new and cryptic dimension of niche differentiation,"The phyllosphere (comprising the leaf surface and interior) is one of the world's largest microbial habitats and is host to an abundant and diverse array of bacteria. Nonetheless, the degree to which bacterial communities are benign, harmful, or beneficial to plants in situ is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the net effect of reducing bacterial abundance and diversity would vary substantially among host species (from harmful to beneficial) and this would be strongly mediated by soil resource availability. To test this, we monitored tree seedling growth responses to commercial antibiotics among replicated resource supply treatments (N,P,K) in a tropical forest in Panama for 29months. We applied either antibiotics or control water to replicated seedlings of five common tree species (Alseis blackiana, Desmopsis panamensis, Heisteria concinna, Sorocea affinis, and Tetragastris panamensis). These antibiotic treatments significantly reduced both the abundance and diversity of bacteria epiphytically as well as endophytically. Overall, the effect of antibiotics on performance was highly host specific. Applying antibiotics increased growth for three species by as much as 49% (Alseis, Heisteria, and Tetragastris), decreased growth for a fourth species by nearly 20% (Sorocea), and had no impact on a fifth species (Desmopsis). Perhaps more importantly, the degree to which foliar bacteria were harmful or not varied with soil resource supply. Specifically, applying antibiotics had no effect when potassium was added but increased growth rate by almost 40% in the absence of potassium. Alternatively, phosphorus enrichment caused the effect of bacteria to switch from being primarily beneficial to harmful or vice versa, but this depended entirely on the presence or absence of nitrogen enrichment (i.e., important and significant interactions). Our results are the first to demonstrate that the net effect of reducing the abundance and diversity of bacteria can have very strong positive and negative effects on seedling performance. Moreover, these effects were clearly mediated by soil resource availability. Though speculative, we suggest that foliar bacteria may interact with soil fertility to comprise an important, yet cryptic dimension of niche differentiation, which can have important implications for species coexistence.","Griffin, EA; Traw, MB; Morin, PJ; Pruitt, JN; Wright, SJ; Carson, WP",ECOLOGY,2016,10.1002/ecy.1537,0.996774640383506,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997706854701587,0.00229314529841291,0.999999999986079,1.3921086505774799e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

21261,Antifungal and antioxidant activities of Ag@FeO-NPs@Chitosan preparation by endophyte Streptomyces aureofaciens,"Biological control using beneficial microorganisms is nowdeveloped for reducing the plant pathogens. Nanoparticles with specific functions have been produced and represented an economical alternative to agochemical through the natural methods of nanoparticle formation. Biosynthesis of Ag@FeO-NPs@Chitosan preparation by Streptomyces aureofaciens was performed against some soil borne pathogenic fungi i.e. Fusarium oxysporum , F. solani, F. subglutinans, Rhizoctonia solani and air borne pathogenic fungi i.e. Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Alternaria solani and Aspergillus niger . To conceive the formation of Ag@FeO-NPs@Chitosan, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy for the biosynthesis of core-shell nanoparticle and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis were done for constructing the structure of nano-composite. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) micrographs evidenced that the size of synthesized nanoparticles is less than 50 nm. As a result, the data showed that the produced core-shell hemtite @Ag nanoparticles are super-paramagnetic. The chitosan is formed in the outer shell of the formula spontaneously due to the presence of chitin in the fungus cell membrane. In vitro bioassay, Ag@FeO-NPs@Chitosan preparation by Streptomyces showed distinct antifungal against all plant pathogens, and inhibited the growth and spores germination. Antioxidant activities as reducing power measurement, DPPH (1,1-Diphenyl-2- picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity, nitric oxide scavenging activity, ABTS free radical scavenging activity and total phenolics contents were greatly increased.

18322,"Streptomyces ginkgonis sp. nov., an endophyte from Ginkgo biloba.","A novel endophytic actinomycete strain, designated KM-1-2T, was isolated from seeds of Ginkgo biloba at Yangling, China. A polyphasic approach was used to study the taxonomy of strain KM-1-2T and it was found to show a range of phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic properties consistent with those of members of the genus Streptomyces. The diamino acid of the cell wall peptidoglycan was identified as LL-diaminopimelic acid. No diagnostic sugars were detected in whole cell hydrolysates. The predominant menaquinones were identified as MK-9(H6) and MK-9(H8). The diagnostic phospholipids were found to be phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine.

5567,Genetic differentiation between hosts and locations in populations of latent Botrytis cinerea in southern England,"This study tested the hypothesis that aggressive, localized infections and asymptomatic systemic infections were caused by distinct specialized groups of Botrytis cinerea, using microsatellite genotypes at nine loci of 243 isolates of B. cinerea obtained from four hosts (strawberry (Fragariaxananassa), blackberry (Rubus fruticosus agg.), dandelion, (Taraxacum officinale agg.) and primrose (Primula vulgaris)) in three regions in southern England (in the vicinities of Brighton, Reading and Bath). The populations were extremely variable, with up to 20 alleles per locus and high genic diversity. Each host in each region had a population of B. cinerea with distinctive genetic features, and there were also consistent host and regional distinctions. The B. cinerea population from strawberry was distinguished from that on other hosts, including blackberry, most notably by a common 154-bp amplicon at locus 5 (present in 35 of 77 samples) that was rare in isolates from other hosts (9/166), and by the rarity (3/77) of a 112-bp allele at locus 7 that was common (58/166) in isolates from other hosts. There was significant linkage disequilibrium overall within the B. cinerea populations on blackberry and strawberry, but with quite different patterns of association among isolates from the two hosts. No evidence was found for differentiation between populations of B. cinerea from systemically infected hosts and those from locally infected fruits.","Rajaguru, BAP; Shaw, MW",PLANT PATHOLOGY,2010,10.1111/j.1365-3059.2010.02346.x,0.850308793187449,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999814610432681,1.8538956731889e-4,0.999999999969992,3.00077740433835e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
362,Harzianic acids and oxazolidinone from the endophytic fungus Ilyonectria sp. and their cytotoxicity activity,"Four undescribed compounds including three harzianic acids ( 1 , 3 and 4 ) and one oxazolidinone ( 2 ), along with three known ones ( 5 - 7 ) were isolated from the solid fermented product of endophytic fungus Ilyonectria sp., their structures were elucidated as 1-amino-harzianic acid ( 1 ), ilyonectria-oxazolidinone ( 2 ),10 ' -nor- isoharzianic acid ( 3 ), isohomoharzianic acid ( 4 ), harzianic acid ( 5 ), isoharzianic acid ( 6 ), homoharzianic acid ( 7 ) by means of detailed chemical evidences and spectroscopic data analysis. All the compounds were evaluated for cytotoxicity against SMMC-7721 human cancer cell lines by MTS assay. Among the seven tested compounds, 1-amino-harzianic acid ( 1 ) demonstrated well cytotoxic activity against SMMC-7721 with IC 50 value of 26.84 mu M.

4734,Volatile compounds of endophyte-free and infected tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.),"Volatile compounds produced by intact plants and ground leaf tissue from endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) were collected by a purge-and-trap procedure and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry The volatile compound profile from ground leaf tissue was similar between E+ and E- clonal plants however, the sheaths of E+ clonal Plants produced higher levels of 1-octen-3-ol, a characteristic volatile compound derived from lipid peroxidation in fungi, which was absent in E- clonal plants. Intact plants produced fewer volatiles than macerated leaves. At 25 degreesC, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol acetate was the most abundant compound, accounting for 77 and 89% of the total volatile emission from E+ and E-plants, respectively. Higher temperature (32 degreesC) significantly reduced the production of (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol acetate. Nonanal was the most abundant compound at 32 degreesC accounting for 52 and 45% of the total volatile emission from E+ and E- plants. Treatment of E+ and E- Plants With jasmonic acid (JA) dramatically altered the volatile compound profile. The levels of (E)-beta -ocimene increased more than 200-fold and accounted for at least 43% of the total volatile emission. Although the presence of endophyte resulted in some qualitative and quantitative differences in the production of volatile compounds, they are unlikely to account for the differences in insect resistance between E I and E- plants. Nevertheless, the production of a unique spectrum of volatiles after JA treatment may represent a significant plant-based defense response in tall fescue that is independent of endophyte.

14371,"Isolation, diversity, and biotechnological potential of rhizo- and endophytic bacteria associated with mangrove plants from Saudi Arabia","Marine bacteria have been exceptional sources of halotolerant enzymes since decades. The aim of the present study was to isolate bacteria producing hydrolytic enzymes from seven different mangroves collected from the coastal area of Thuwal, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, and to further screen them for other enzymatic and antifungal activities. We have isolated 46 different rhizo- and endophytic bacteria from the soil, roots, and leaves of the mangroves using different enzymatic media. These bacterial strains were capable of producing industrially important enzymes (cellulase, protease, lipase, and amylase). The bacteria were screened further for antagonistic activity against fungal pathogens. Finally, these bacterial strains were identified on the basis of the16S rDNA sequence. Taxonomic and phylogenetic analysis revealed 95.9-100% sequence identity to type strains of related species. The dominant phylum was Gammaproteobacteria (γ-Proteobacteria), which comprised 10 different genera - Erwinia, Vibrio, Psychrobacter, Aidingimonas, Marinobacter, Chromohalobacter, Halomonas, Microbulbifer, and Alteromonas. Firmicutes was the second dominant phylum, which contained only the genus Bacillus. Similarly, only Isoptericola belonged to Actinobacteria. Further these enzyme-producing bacteria were tested for the production of other enzymes. Most of the active strains showed cellulytic and lipolytic activities. Several were also active against fungal pathogens. Our results demonstrated that the mangroves represent an important source of potentially active bacteria producing enzymes and antifungal metabolites (bioactive products). These bacteria are a source of novel halophilic enzymes and antibiotics that can find industrial and medicinal use. © 2017 The Authors.",Bibi F.; Ullah I.; Alvi S.A.; Bakhsh S.A.; Yasir M.; Al-Ghamdi A.A.K.; Azhar E.I.,Genetics and Molecular Research,2017,10.4238/gmr16029657,0.70438122740611,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.802121421091476,0.197878578908524,0.999999327728979,6.72271020851767e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
10908,Seasonally dynamic fungal communities in the Quercus macrocarpa phyllosphere differ between urban and nonurban environments,"The fungal richness, diversity and community composition in the Quercus macrocarpa phyllosphere were compared across a growing season in trees located in six stands within and outside a small urban center using 454-sequencing and DNA tagging. The approaches did not differentiate between endophytic and epiphytic fungal communities. Fungi accumulated in the phyllosphere rapidly and communities were temporally dynamic, with more than a third of the analyzed operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and half of the BLAST-inferred genera showing distinct seasonal patterns. The seasonal patterns could be explained by fungal life cycles or environmental tolerances. The communities were hyperdiverse and differed between the urban and nonurban stands, albeit not consistently across the growing season. Foliar macronutrients (nitrogen (N), potassium (K) and sulfur (S)), micronutrients (boron (B), manganese (Mn) and selenium (Se)) and trace elements (cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn)) were enriched in the urban trees, probably as a result of anthropogenic activities. Because of correlations with the experimental layout, these chemical elements should not be considered as community drivers without further empirical studies. We suggest that a combination of mechanisms leads to differences between urban and nonurban communities. Among those are stand isolation and size, nutrient and pollutant accumulation plus stand management, including fertilization and litter removal.","Jumpponen, A; Jones, KL",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,2010,10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03197.x,0.991841769970489,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.421447779459199,0.578552220540801,0.999846772347659,1.5322765234149e-4,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
11945,Biostimulant Effects of Chaetomium globosum and Minimedusa polyspora Culture Filtrates on Cichorium intybus Plant: Growth Performance and Metabolomic Traits,"In this study, we investigated the biostimulant effect of fungal culture filtrates obtained from Chaetomium globosum and Minimedusa polyspora on growth performance and metabolomic traits of chicory (Cichorium intybus) plants. For the first time, we showed that M. polyspora culture filtrate exerts a direct plant growth-promoting effect through an increase of biomass, both in shoots and roots, and of the leaf area. Conversely, no significant effect on morphological traits and biomass yield was observed in C. intybus plants treated with C. globosum culture filtrate. Based on H-1-NMR metabolomics data, differential metabolites and their related metabolic pathways were highlighted. The treatment with C. globosum and M. polyspora culture filtrates stimulated a common response in C. intybus roots involving the synthesis of 3-OH-butyrate through the decrease in the synthesis of fatty acids and sterols, as a mechanism balancing the NADPH/NADP(+) ratio. The fungal culture filtrates differently triggered the phenylpropanoid pathway in C. intybus plants: C. globosum culture filtrate increased phenylalanine and chicoric acid in the roots, whereas M. polyspora culture filtrate stimulated an increase of 4-OH-benzoate. Chicoric acid, whose biosynthetic pathway in the chicory plant is putative and still not well known, is a very promising natural compound playing an important role in plant defense. On the contrary, benzoic acids serve as precursors for a wide variety of essential compounds playing crucial roles in plant fitness and defense response activation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that shows the biostimulant effect of C. globosum and M. polyspora culture filtrates on C. intybus growth and metabolome, increasing the knowledge on fungal bioresources for the development of biostimulants.","Spinelli, V; Brasili, E; Sciubba, F; Ceci, A; Giampaoli, O; Miccheli, A; Pasqua, G; Persiani, AM",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2022,10.3389/fpls.2022.879076,0.98176092181188,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.968392829651461,0.0316071703485395,0.99995816173228,4.18382677199736e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

13949,Effects of AM fungus and grass endophyte on the infection of Lolium perenne by the pathogen Bipolaris sorokinianum in a greenhouse; [温室条件下AM真菌和禾草内生真菌对根腐离蠕孢侵染黑麦草的影响],"In a greenhouse, perennial ryegrass seeds infected with (E+) and without (E-) grass endophyte and pot culture inoculated with (AM) or without (NM) the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus intraradices were used as the grass endophyte and AM treatments. The pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana was inoculated six weeks after seedling emergence by spraying onto leaves and pouring onto soil for root infection, and the same amount of distilled water was applied to non-inoculated (B-) treatments. Two weeks after pathogen inoculation, disease incidence, AM colonization, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic indexes and P content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 concentration of the perennial ryegrass host plants were measured to determine the growth, physiological and biochemical impacts of the pathogen on perennial ryegrass. It was found that the disease incidence of perennial ryegrass inoculated with pathogen ranged from 2.50%-31.25% in leaves. Both AM fungus and grass endophyte reduced the disease incidence, and also promoted P absorption and photosynthesis, and increased the biomass accumulation to some degree. Compared with control treatments, infected with grass endophyte and inoculated with AM fungus decreased disease incidence of perennial ryegrass that inoculated with pathogen in leaves by 32.00%-92.00%. In the all treatments with plants that were infected by pathogen in leaves and roots; the co-colonization of AM fungus and grass endophyte increased net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content, total P content and SOD enzyme activity by 132.25% and 132.17%, 56.00% and 134.48%, 37.69% and 40.77%, 41.51% and 38.17%, 95.65% and 11.72% (P<0.05), as well as decreased MDA and H2O2 concentration by 31.36% and 24.45%, 58.62% and 22.22%, respectively. These results showed that AM fungi and grass endophyte can promote plant growth and improve plant resistance to disease, and the combination of both the symbiont microorganisms provided the greatest benefit. © 2019, Editorial Office of Acta Prataculturae Sinica.

20553,Occurrence of storage fungi in jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) seeds,"Atropha is a potential source for production of bio-diesel and an alternative source for fossil fuels. The present study is undertaken for the analysis of storage fungi and its biodiversity in Jatropha seed samples collected from local market and research institutes in Chennai. Standard plating technique was used to study the growth of storage fungi in seeds stored for 12 to 60 months by using selective media called osmophilic media. The analysis of storage fungi in seeds with different treatments to observe as (1) surface mycoflora (2) surface invaders (3) internal fungi (4) kernel fungi. The results show that, the occurrence of different species of Aspergillus, Penicillium and Mucor species was the dominant mycoflora even from interior portion of the seeds. Among the species of storage fungi encountered, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus glaucus, Aspergillus fumigatus and Penicillium species were frequently present in the order of dominance. Mucor and Rhizhopus also occur constantly in all the samples. The higher contamination of seeds with storage fungi indicates the possibility of quality losses particularly in lipid, which may affect the quality of bio-diesel. Among the different strains of A. flavus, few were found to produce aflatoxin B1. The spoilage of lipids by the named fungi, may affect the quality of bio-diesel. This study will create awareness of fungal spoilage on biodiesel seeds and for remedy to prevent the storage losses by microorganisms.","Jayaraman, P; NesaPriya, S; Parameshwari, S; Priya, SS; Jawahar, N; Babu, HS",AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY RESEARCH,2011,NA,0.908764428975133,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.905848545381475,0.0941514546185247,0.999993253827911,6.74617208928918e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
20596,Site and seasonal influences on the fungal community on leaves and stems of Pinus and Quercus seedlings in forest nurseries,"Fungal assemblages present in nursery seedlings were surveyed, aimed to evaluate influences of site, season, host and plant part. Four sampling sites were selected; three of them were sampled twice, in spring and autumn. Needles/leaves and stems were collected from five host species: Quercus ilex, Q. pyrenaica, Pinus pinea, P nigra, and P sylvestris and surf ace-sterilized with sodium hypochlorite. A total of 1557 fungal strains, pertaining to 59 'species' or morphological types, were recovered. The dominant species, with higher isolation frequencies were Alternaria alternata complex, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Phoma sp., Clonostachys rosea, Ulocladium sp., Trichothecium roseum, Cytospora leucosperma, and Rhizopus sp. Median values of fungal species per observation differed significantly among the sites. The diversity of fungal species was significantly higher in the spring, and isolation frequencies for most of the dominant species were also dependent on the season, however the number of isolates per sampling was not influenced by the season. The results showed that the most frequent species (Alternaria alternata complex and Cladosporium cladosporioides) were associated with autumn observations, whereas higher frequencies of saprobic fungi (Aspergillus niger, Ulocladium sp. and Cytospora sp.) were found in spring.","Martín-Pinto, P; Pajares, JA; Nanos, N; Díez, JJ",SYDOWIA,2004,NA,0.953453279618844,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990517204302071,0.00948279569792939,0.999999940355942,5.96440582478763e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

A total of 9 498 Galerina and 5 731 Mycena reads were mapped to branches broadly distributed throughout backbone trees, reflecting no obvious evolutionary specialization of particular fungal lineages to moss hosts/substrata. Although a few OTUs occurred with equal frequency across the hosts, most exhibited some degree of specialization to one or more bryophytes, indicating that the quality of different mosses as substratum varies between species. With one exception, all Galerina and Mycena OTUs were more frequent and abundant in senescent than photosynthetic tissues, likely reflecting saprotrophic nutritional modes in the fungi. A single Mycena OTU showed considerable colonization of both tissues, which may reflect an opportunistic parasitic or endophytic lifestyle. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

11704,Efficacy of Lippia alba (Mill.) NE Brown essential oil and its monoterpene aldehyde constituents against fungi isolated from some edible legume seeds and aflatoxin B1 production,"The present study deals with evaluation of antifungal properties of Lippia alba essential oil (EO) and two of its monoterpene aldehyde constituents against legume-contaminating fungi. Seventeen different fungal species were isolated from 11 varieties of legumes, and aflatoxigenic isolates of Aspergillus flavus were identified. Hydrodistillation method was used to extract the EO from fresh leaves. The CC and GC-MS analysis of EO revealed the monoterpene aldehydes viz. geranial (22.2%) and neral (14.2%) as the major components. The antifungal activity of EO, geranial and neral was evaluated by contact assay on Czapek's-dox agar. The EO (0.25-1 mu L/mL) and its two constituents (1 mu L/ml.) showed remarkable antifungal effects against all the fungal isolates (growth inhibition range 32.1-100%). Their minimal inhibitory (MIC) and fungicidal (MFC) concentrations for A. flavus were lower than those of the systemic fungicide Bavistin. Aflatoxin B-1 (AFB(1)) production by three isolates of A. flavus was strongly inhibited even at the lower fungistatic concentration of EO and its constituents. There was no adverse effect of treatments on seed germination, and rather. there was enhanced seedling growth in the EO-treated seeds. It is concluded that L alba EO and two of its constituents could be safely used as effective preservative for food legumes against fungal infections and mycotoxins. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

8069,"Specialized antiplasmodial secondary metabolites from Aspergillus niger 58, an endophytic fungus from Terminalia catappa","Ethnopharmacological relevance: Terminalia catappa L. (West Indian-Almond) is a medicinal plant used in traditional medicine for the treatment of infectious diseases. Moreover, various organic extracts prepared from this plant have been reported to exhibit antiplasmodial activity. Aim of the study: The need for new antimalarials is still an urgency driven by the alarmingly high burden of malaria in endemic regions, with multitude of people dying annually. We have previously identified an endophytic fungus Aspergillus niger 58 harboured by T. catappa as having promising specialized secondary metabolites against the malaria parasites. In the present study, we report the antiplasmodial activity-guided chromatographic isolation of some metabolites secreted by this endophytic fungus. Materials and methods: The SYBR Green I-based fluorescence microtiter plate assay was used to monitor the growth of Plasmodium falciparum parasites in culture in the presence and absence of inhibitors and results were validated by microscopic analysis of Giemsa-stained culture smears. Giemsa-stain microscopy was also used to study the cell cycle stage-specific action of selected fractions. Results: The results revealed that the multidimensional purification of the crude extract (IC50: 4.03 mu g/mL) provided RPHPLC F17 (IC50: 0.09 mu g/mL) and RPHPLC F18 (IC50: 0.1 mu g/mL) with activity against P. falciparum 3D7 (Pf3D7) strain. Moreover, both fractions at IC99 (0.5 mu g/mL) exhibited multi-stages action by targeting all the three stages of the life cycle of blood-stage Pf3D7. Two compounds, flavasperone (1) and aurasperone A (2) were isolated, of which aurasperone A exhibited good potency against Pf3D7 (IC50: 4.17 mu M) and P. falciparum INDO (PfINDO) (IC50: 3.08 mu M). Conclusion: Our study adds credence to the notion that endophytic extracts are potential storehouses for potent specialized secondary metabolites that can be harnessed to fight the malaria parasite and reduce the burden of this disease worldwide. An endophyte that can be cultured in laboratory with ability to secrete promising metabolites of medicinal value holds the promise of conserving Nature from the threat of annihilation of flora for medicinal purposes.","Toghueo, RMK; Kemgne, EAM; Sahal, D; Yadav, M; Kagho, DUK; Yang, BJ; Baker, BJ; Boyom, FF",JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY,2021,10.1016/j.jep.2020.113672,0.653080243239622,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999916304596431,8.36954035687874e-5,0.99999526196763,4.73803236977766e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
2378,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi make endophyte-induced plant volatiles perceptible,"Most cool season grasses are commonly associated with asexual endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). These two symbionts are known to provide different benefits to the host plant through altering its phenotype when they are present. In isolation, either of them can affect the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by the host grass, but their interactive influences on this trait are unknown. We hypothesized that changes in host grasses VOCs profile induced by the presence of asexual endophytes within aerial tissues, depend on whether these plants are also colonized by AMF. We designed a factorial greenhouse experiment, in which we identified and quantified VOCs emitted by Lolium multiflorum plants with contrasting levels of infection with the endophyte Epichloe occultans (low < 5% and high > 95%), growing in pots with sterilized soil that could be inoculated or not with AMF. Results showed that total VOCs emission in plants with high infection levels of E. occultans doubled the emission of plants with low levels of the endophyte, but only in plants previously inoculated with AMF. The green leaf volatile Z3-Hexenyl acetate dominated the blend. Its emission was three times higher in plants with high level of association with both types of symbionts compared to plants with high level of AMF but low level of endophyte.

12711,Wheat fungal endophyte communities are inseparable from the host and influence plant development,"Plants harbor complex and highly diverse fungal endophyte communities (FECs), making it difficult to evaluate the functional role of individual taxa, subsets of the community, or the FEC as a whole. To reduce the complexity of this system, we aimed to produce fungi-null wheat (Triticum aestivum) plants. To this end, we treated seeds with heat and fungicides and generated plants from rescued embryos and callus tissue. A culture-based approach and reverse transcription PCR analysis were negative, indicating that all treatments produced plants apparently free of fungi. However, the analysis of DNA using digital droplet PCR and next-generation sequencing revealed that tissues from all treatments retained low levels but diversity-rich FECs. While the FECs varied in composition across treatments and tissues, they all included core taxa of the mycobiome. The reduced fungal biomass, along with the changes in FEC composition, negatively affected plant development, supporting a FEC contribution to proper plant development and fitness. Our discovery that a large part of the FEC cannot be separated from plants and can be transmitted through seeds and tissue culture calls for reevaluation of particular microbiome paradigms, such as core taxa concepts, transmission modes, and functional species. IMPORTANCE The native microbiome in a given plant must be considered when evaluating the effect of a single taxon or synthetic community. The pre-existing microbiome can interact with artificially added microbial cargo, which affects the final outcome. Such issues can be at least partially solved by the use of endophyte-free plants, which provide a clean background that should be useful in determining the effect of a single taxon, taxa combinations, or the entire microbiome on plant performance. Previous reports regarded plants as endophyte-free or axenic by the lack of fungal growth on culture media or the generation of plants from tissue cultures. We showed here that while fungi could not be isolated from fungicide-treated or tissue culture-regenerated plants, nevertheless, all plants contained rich fungal endophyte communities; namely, it was impossible to create fungi-free wheat plants. Our results call for rethinking fundamental microbiome-related concepts, such as core taxa, transmission mode, and functional species.","Sharon, O; Kagan-Trushina, N; Sharon, A",MBIO,2024,10.1128/mbio.02533-23,0.969462590724654,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99934850145098,6.5149854901952e-4,0.999999924348792,7.56512077426663e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
600,Diversity and Symbiotic Associations of Endophytic Fungi in Calotropis procera (Aiton) WT Aiton (Asclepiadaceae) Across Three Egyptian Regions: Phenotypic Characterization and Mitotic Activity,"Endophytic fungi are essential contributors to fungal biodiversity, playing key roles in plant defense against pathogens, alleviation of abiotic stress, and promotion of growth. This study conducted a comprehensive survey of the phenotypic characterization of Calotropis procera and its associated endophytic fungi across three regions in Egypt: Qena-Safaga, Qena, and Qena-Kosseir. Positive and significant Pearson correlations among plant morphological traits suggest intrinsic connections. Fungal species diversity exhibited significant variation across the three regions examined. Particularly, the Qena-Kosseir region demonstrated the highest fungal species richness both in soil samples and endophytic fungi. Unique to this region, Allocanariomyces tritici, Aspergillus terreus, Chaetomium globosum, C. murorum, Cladosporium cladosporioides, C. sphaerospermum, Fusarium proliferatum, Penicillium crustosum, P. granulatum, P. spinuloseum, and Roussoella intermedia were identified as endophytes. Additionally, compared to other regions, the Qena-Kosseir area exhibited the presence of Aspergillus fumigatus, A. ochraceus, A. ornatus, A. sclerotiocabonarus, Drechslera halodes, Emericella echinulata, Fusarium oxysporum, and Macrophomina phaseolina in soil samples, underscoring its distinct fungal community composition. Furthermore, antimitotic assays using the Allium cepa test revealed distinct effects of endophytic extracts on various mitotic stages. Of the 33 treatments, 11 showed an increase in the mitotic index (MI), indicating a potential positive effect on plant growth and cell division. This study offers valuable insights into the diversity and functional roles of endophytic fungi associated with C. procera, highlighting their promising applications in sustainable agriculture and plant health management.","Zaki, H; Hussein, MA; El-Dawy, EGAM",MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,2025,10.1007/s00248-025-02503-6,0.962869878862946,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999713870741829,2.8612925817133e-4,0.999999999999995,5.44009282066327e-15,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10080,"An endophyte of Picrorhiza kurroa Royle ex. Benth, producing menthol, phenylethyl alcohol and 3-hydroxypropionic acid, and other volatile organic compounds","An endophytic fungus, PR4 was found in nature associated with the rhizome of Picrorhiza kurroa, a high altitude medicinal plant of Kashmir Himalayas. The fungus was found to inhibit the growth of several phyto-pathogens by virtue of its volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Molecular phylogeny, based on its ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 ribosomal gene sequence, revealed the identity of the fungus as Phomopsis/Diaporthe sp. This endophyte was found to produce a unique array of VOCs, particularly, menthol, phenylethyl alcohol, (+)-isomenthol, beta-phellandrene, beta-bisabolene, limonene, 3-pentanone and 1-pentanol. The purification of compounds from the culture broth of PR4 led to the isolation of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HPA) as a major metabolite. This is the first report of a fungal culture producing a combination of biologically and industrially important metabolites-menthol, phenylethyl alcohol, and 3-HPA. The investigation into the monoterpene biosynthetic pathway of PR4 led to the partial characterization of isopiperitenone reductase (ipr) gene, which seems to be significantly distinct from the plant homologue. The biosynthesis of plant-like-metabolites, such as menthol, is of significant academic and industrial significance. This study indicates that PR4 is a potential candidate for upscaling of menthol, phenylethyl alcohol, and 3-HPA, as well as for understanding the menthol/monoterpene biosynthetic pathway in fungi.","Qadri, M; Deshidi, R; Shah, BA; Bindu, K; Vishwakarma, RA; Riyaz-Ul-Hassan, S",WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY,2015,10.1007/s11274-015-1910-6,0.976154360570353,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.986229241804622,0.0137707581953775,0.999996742472892,3.25752710816918e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5670,Spectroscopic Investigation of Tomato Seed Germination Stimulated by Trichoderma spp.,"Simple Summary Fungi of the genus Trichoderma have a number of positive effects on plants that are manifested in the stimulation of plant growth and tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress factors. Our findings provide evidence for the swift response of tomato seeds to Trichoderma spp. exposure under in vitro conditions. The response was examined after 48 h of germination, before any physical contact was established between Trichoderma spp. and tomato seeds. Spectroscopic methods were used to reveal the nature of tomato seed germination stimulation by Trichoderma. Induction of the higher synthesis of phenolic compounds through plant specific responses within seed radicles was indicated. Observed differences between treatments were predominantly based on modifications in the pectin content in the middle lamella, as well as alterations in hemicelluloses and xyloglucan within the primary cell wall. Significant alterations in the composition of tomato seed radicles treated with Trichoderma spp., characterized by changes in total protein and a concurrent reduction in pectin and/or xyloglucan levels were observed. Applied spectroscopic methods are valuable tools to investigate the stimulation of seed germination by symbiotic microorganisms. Characterized by low cost and high measurement speed, they could be used in large-scale selection of the best genotype-strain combinations for better germination. Seed germination is a complex process that can be negatively affected by numerous stresses. Trichoderma spp. are known as effective biocontrol agents as well as plant growth and germination stimulators. However, understanding of the early interactions between seeds and Trichoderma spp. remains limited. In the present paper, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy were used to reveal the nature of tomato seed germination as stimulated by Trichoderma. A rapid response of tomato seeds to Trichoderma spp. was observed within 48 h on Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) substrate, preceding any physical contact. Raman analysis indicated that both Trichoderma species stimulated phenolic compound synthesis by triggering plant-specific responses in seed radicles. The impact of T. harzianum and T. brevicompactum on two tomato cultivars resulted in alterations to the middle lamella pectin, cellulose, and xyloglucan in the primary cell wall. The Raman spectra indicated increased xylan content in NA with T9 treatment as well as increased hemicelluloses in GZ with T4 treatment. Moreover, T4 treatment resulted in elevated conjugated aldehydes in lignin in GZ, whereas the trend was reversed in NA. Additionally, FTIR analysis revealed significant changes in total protein levels in Trichoderma spp.-treated tomato seed radicles, with simultaneous decreases in pectin and/or xyloglucan. Our results indicate that two complementary spectroscopic methods, FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, can give valuable information on rapid changes in the plant cell wall structure of tomato radicles during germination stimulated by Trichoderma spp.","Vukelic, I; Radic, D; Pecinar, I; Levic, S; Djikanovic, D; Radotic, K; Pankovic, D",BIOLOGY-BASEL,2024,10.3390/biology13050340,0.942972826426824,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.772717732651023,0.227282267348978,0.999998998765978,1.00123402180241e-6,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
12125,Adoption of a novel medium for the industrial (3000 L) production of Serendipita indica employing a nutrient limitation strategy using insoluble carbon and phosphate sources,"The use of the endophytic fungus Serendipita indica has rapidly increased due to its wide range of host species, ability to foster plant-growth, and ability to confer tolerance to a number of stresses. However, its industrial-scale production is still in its infancy due to its low-biomass yield and prolonged cultivation time. Thus far, Hill-Kafer medium has traditionally been used for S. indica cultivation, resulting in lower yields and excessively long incubation times. Here, we adopted a simple insoluble carbon and phosphate input medium for rapidly generating high biomass. We developed and optimized the SIF1 medium, achieving maximum biomass production (424.5 +/- 1.9 g/L), significantly outperforming Hill-Kafer medium. Statistical optimization of SIF1 identified optimal levels (15 g/L oats, 7.5 g/L tricalcium phosphate, 95-hr incubation). Validated results in the laboratory (FUS-10 L: 484.4 +/- 4.7), pilot (300 L: 496.5 +/- 7 g/L), and industrial (3000L: 492.4 +/- 7.1 g/L) bioreactors proved the efficacy of SIF1. Compared to Hill-Kafer (54.8 +/- 3.7 g/L), SIF1 showed nine-fold higher biomass productivity and reduced cultivation time by approximately 6 days. Based on our findings, it appears that SF1 will be a highly efficient medium for producing S. indica on an industrial scale and expanding its use.One-Sentence Summary This study presents a rapid industrial production strategy for the beneficial fungus Serendipita indica, providing a scalable solution for wider applications and contributing to global food security and environmental sustainability.","Al Rashid, J; Abuhena, M; Karim, MD; Rahman, L; Wang, JJ; Huang, ZY",JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY,2025,10.1093/jimb/kuaf009,0.770983317643991,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.929110062704441,0.0708899372955586,0.999999962919344,3.70806559901737e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

15773,"Biofabrication of gold nanoparticles mediated by the endophytic Cladosporium species: Photodegradation, in vitro anticancer activity and in vivo antitumor studies","Green fabrication of nanoparticles (NPs) using biological sources is the fast-growing trend replacing chemical synthesis via toxic materials. Considering the importance and feasibility of green fabricated NPs, the present research focuses on the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using the aqueous extract of the endophytic Cladosporium sp. (MycoAuNPs) isolated from Commiphora wightii. The synthesized MycoAuNPs are characterized using UV–Vis spectroscopic, FTIR, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The synthesized NPs showed a sharp absorption peak at 524 nm, with an average size between 5 and 10 nm in a spherical shape. XRD revealed the crystalline nature, and EDX profiling confirmed the presence of gold (Au) and oxygen (O) atoms. The biological potential of MycoAuNPs were tested under both in vitro and in vivo conditions. MycoAuNPs showed anti-cancer activity in breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (IC50 38.23 µg/mL) through the induction of apoptosis. Further, MycoAuNPs showed potential against growth of tumor in tumor-bearing mice models. MycoAuNPs significantly reduced the body weight, ascites volume, and increased the lifespan of EAC bearing mice. It induced apoptosis of the EAC cells, which was confirmed by DNA fragmentation and Giemsa staining. Also, they did not develop any secondary complications or side effects in normal mice. The photocatalytic activity of MycoAuNPs tested against Rhodamine B and Methylene Blue dyes showed potential dye degradation in the presence of sunlight. Thus, the present study gives a clear idea of the multifaceted therapeutic and catalytic applications of the biosynthesized MycoAuNPs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Munawer U.; Raghavendra V.B.; Ningaraju S.; Krishna K.L.; Ghosh A.R.; Melappa G.; Pugazhendhi A.,International Journal of Pharmaceutics,2020,10.1016/j.ijpharm.2020.119729,0.979466455976913,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98858677000175,0.0114132299982497,0.999999973885357,2.61146427815717e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

We observed that the daily consumption by grasshoppers fed with control plants was almost twice that of those that were fed treated plants. Significant differences in fecundity of grasshoppers that were fed with treated plants compared with those that only fed on control plants were also observed. The number of eggs laid per female fed with control plants was 27.2, while the number of eggs laid per female that were fed during 15 d with treated plants was 17.7. Similar results were observed when the number of embryonated eggs was evaluated. The highest number of embryonated eggs were recorded in those females that only fed on control plants (96%) while fewer embryonated eggs were recorded in grasshoppers fed for 15 d with treated plants only (25%). In relation to food preference the average consumption rate for D. maculipennis females on control corn plants was 303.8 +/- 624.5 mg while it was only 25 +/- 62.1 mg on plants treated with B. bassiana as an endophyte. In summary, we observed that B. bassiana as a corn plant endophyte negatively affected the daily consumption rate, fecundity and food preference of D. maculipennis.","Pelizza, SA; Mariottini, Y; Russo, LM; Vianna, MF; Scorsetti, AC; Lange, CE",JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE,2017,10.1093/jisesa/iex024,0.98477745494534,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.964260464645016,0.0357395353549836,0.999999966212769,3.37872309019716e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15100,Distribution of endophytic fungi in the leaf and stem of Cissus quadrangularis Linn.-A comparative study,"The present study focused on the diversity and distribution of endophytic fungal species in different plant parts (stems and leaves) of the plant Cissus quadrangularis Linn. collected from different locations of Assam, India. Plant samples were collected from three districts, Kamrup, Barpeta and Biswanath of Assam for endophytic fungal isolation. Variation was found in the distribution of fungal endophytes in stems and leaves of the plant collected from different locations under study. The percentage isolation of the endophytic fungal isolates was more from the stems collected from Kamrup (M) whereas the percentage isolation of endophytic fungal isolates was more from the leaves collected from Biswanath Chariali and Barpeta. Shannon-diversity and Simpson diversity indices of fungal endophytes varied in stems and leaves of the plant under study. This variation can be attributed to the soil conditions of the sampling site as well as the seasonal variation during sampling periods. Cladosporium sp. and Fusarium sp., are the most dominant and frequently occurring endophytic fungal species in C. quadrangularis of Kamrup (M) and Barpeta districts. Colletotrichum sp. and Rhizopus sp. were the dominant endophytic fungal species in Biswanath district. Since C. quadrangularis is used traditionally in the treatments of bone fracture, the study of endophytes associated to this plant could be of paramount significance with a scope of identifying the potent endophytes that are capable of producing bioactive compounds necessary in bone-healing. © 2023, Pavol Jozef Safarik University in Kosice.

Morphological and chemical studies showed that twenty-nine isolates belonged to the Streptomyces genus and five were non-Streptomyces. All isolates were screened for their in vitro antifungal activity against Rhizoctonia solani. The six that had the greatest pathogen inhibitory capacities were subsequently tested for their in vivo biocontrol potential on R. solani damping-off in sterilized and non-sterilized soils, and for their plant-growth promoting activities on tomato seedlings. In both soils, coating tomato seeds with antagonistic isolates significantly reduced (P<0.05) the severity of damping-off of tomato seedlings. Among the isolates tested, the strains CA-2 and AA-2 exhibited the same disease incidence reduction as thioperoxydicarbonic diamide, tetramethylthiram (TMTD) and no significant differences (P<0.05) were observed. Furthermore, they resulted in a significant increase in the seedling fresh weight, the seedling length and the root length of the seed-treated seedlings compared to the control.

Phosphate-solubilizing rhizosphere fungus, Talaromyces funiculosus SLS8, isolated from Neem (Azadirachta indica) on saline soil, was tolerant to environmental stressors, salinity and agricultural systemic fungicides. Phosphate solubilization under different nutritional conditions was investigated by culturing T. funiculosus SLS8 in Pikovskaya liquid medium containing different nitrogen sources (ammonium sulfate, casein, urea, potassium nitrate or sodium nitrate) and carbon sources (glucose, fructose, galactose or sucrose), NaCl, and three systemic fungicides. The highest concentration of solubilised phosphate (187 mg P L-1) was achieved after 5 days of incubation in the medium with glucose and ammonium sulphate. The culture pH decreased from 6.5 to 4.2 and HPLC demonstrated organic acid production. Phosphate solubilized was highly negatively correlated with pH (r = -0.96). Increasing salinity had no effect on phosphate solubilization. The maximum tolerance limits to systemic fungicides carbendazim, mancozeb, and hexaconazole were 12.5 mu g mL(-1), 2,000 mu g mL(-1) and 250 mu l mL(-1) respectively. At these concentrations carbendazim, mancozeb and hexaconazole were found to decrease phosphate solubilization by 55 %, 37 %, and 30 %, respectively. Our results indicate that T. funiculosus SLS8 may be a potential candidate for the development of a biofertilizer for maintaining available phosphate levels in environmentally stressed soils such as saline agricultural soils impacted by systemic fungicide application or seed treatment.","Kanse, OS; Whitelaw-Weckert, M; Kadam, TA; Bhosale, HJ",ANNALS OF MICROBIOLOGY,2015,10.1007/s13213-014-0839-6,0.945847482722705,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.906295271948607,0.0937047280513925,0.999999629364512,3.70635487634274e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

19632,Attenuation of antibiotic resistance genes in livestock manure through vermicomposting via Protaetia brevitarsis and its fate in a soil-vegetable system.,"Scarab larvae (Protaetia brevitarsis) could transform large quantities of agricultural waste into compost, providing a promising bio-fertilizer for soil management. There is an urgent need to assess the risk of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soil-vegetable system with application of compost derived from P. brevitarsis larvae. We conducted a pot experiment to compare the changes of ARGs in the soil and lettuce by adding four types of manure, livestock manure (chicken and swine manure) and the corresponding larval frass. Significantly low numbers of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were detected in both larval frass compared with the corresponding livestock manure. Pot experiment showed that the detected numbers of ARGs and MGEs in bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, and root endophytes were significantly lower in the frass-amended treatments than the raw manure-amended treatments. Furthermore, the relative abundance of ARGs and MGEs with application of chicken-frass was significant lower in rhizosphere soil and leaf endophyte. Using non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis, the patterns of soil ARGs and MGEs with chicken-frass application were more close to those from the bulk soil in the control. Structural equation models indicated that livestock manure addition was the main driver shaping soil ARGs with raw manure application, while MGEs were the key drivers in frass-amended treatments. These findings demonstrated that application of livestock manure vermicomposting via scarab larvae (P. brevitarsis) may be at low risk in spreading manure-borne ARGs through soil-plant system, providing an alternative technique for reducing ARGs in organic waste.",Zhao X; Shen JP; Shu CL; Jin SS; Di HJ; Zhang LM; He JZ,The Science of the total environment,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150781,0.516566493705958,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997847522001303,0.00215247799869653,0.99999996197746,3.80225397833556e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
9517,Growth and mycorrhizal colonization of the tomato IPA06 inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on organic substrate,"Tomato IPA06 is a variety that presents fruits resistant to transport and adapted to the rustic cultivation, whose interaction with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) has not yet been found in the literature. The objective of this work was to evaluate the growth and colonization of the IPA06 tomato cultivated with AMF in organic substrates. The experimental design was completely randomized by the cultivation of the IPA06 tomato in five treatments (control - without fungal inoculum and four mycorrhizal fungi inoculants: UFLA05 - Gigaspora albida, UFLA351 - Rhizoglomus clarum, UFLA372 - Claroideoglomus etunicatum and UFLA401 - Acaulospora morrowiae), in organic substrate, with 10 replicates. The AMFs inoculated influenced in the germination period. The use of organic substrate does not inhibit tomato colonization by AMFs. The mycorrhizal colonization of the IPA06 tomato does not guarantee an increase in the vegetal biomass, but it favors the precocity in the flowering, being responsive to the isolates UFLA351 and UFLA401 that can be used as inoculants for organic cultivation.","Mendonça, JD; de Oliveira, PR; Santos, JS; Santos, JFS; Menezes, GD; Costa, FM; Barbosa, AVG; Marino, RH",REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS AGRARIAS-AGRARIA,2019,10.5039/agraria.v14i3a6559,0.985058881665924,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996339777786339,0.00366022221366147,0.999903825495423,9.61745045769957e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Since various protein kinases are thought to be involved in mutual signaling in symbiotic interactions, we analyzed transcript profile of rice protein kinase genes during the infection process by real-time PCR. A rice L-type lectin protein kinase (OslecRK) and Arabidopsis AtLecRK genes are highly upregulated in roots during the initial stage of symbiotic association. In order to investigate the role of LecRK gene in root colonization, the Arabidopsis mutant line (Atlecrk) of rice homolog was used which shows the restricted intracellular penetration of the P. indica hyphae. The results indicate that LecRK might be a crucial factor in perception and recognition during plant-P. indica association by regulating fungal invasion.","Nivedita; Verma, PK; Upadhyaya, KC",PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTER,2017,10.1007/s11105-017-1024-4,0.982560804880627,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997728205711574,0.00227179428842614,0.999999979655883,2.03441167245799e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5554,Ergot alkaloids in Norwegian wild grasses: a mass spectrometric approach,"Ergot alkaloids are mycotoxins which are produced among fungi in the family Clavicipitaceae. Poisoning with ergot alkaloids is an important veterinary problem in animal husbandry and has recently also been recognised in wild animals. While the poisoning syndrome observed in domestic animals such as cattle, horses and sheep is usually caused by endophyte-infected grass, the recently observed ergotism among Norwegian cervids is probably due to infection of wild grasses with Claviceps. Mass spectrometry is today the method of choice for the rapid qualitative and quantitative determination of many natural compounds. This study uses tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry as well as ion trap mass spectrometry in connection with electrospray(+) ionisation for the quantification, screening and fragmentation of ergot alkaloids in extracts from Claviceps sclerotia that had been picked from wild grasses from several locations in Norway. Ergotamine, ergovaline, ergonovine and ergocryptine were available as standards and were quantified in the extracts, while ergocrystine, ergocornine, ergonine/ergosine, lysergic acid and lysergol were identified on the basis of their molecular weights and semi-quantified. Ergocrystine dominated the alkaloid spectrum of most extracts. Levels of the quantified alkaloids were in the range 0.2-9300 mu g/g. Several unknown ergot alkaloids were found in the extracts. MSn experiments identified some as simple lysergic acid amide derivatives, while othes are probably related to ergocrystine and ergocryptine by dehydration, dehydrogenation and/or amino acid substitution at R-1 of the peptide moiety.

15641,Endophytic fungal isolation from Blumea axillaris: Identification and biological activity of secondary metabolites,"Medicinal plants are a wealthy source of natural medicinal properties and remain as base for new drug discoveries. Endophyte from the specific medicinal plants produce the analogous metabolites as that of the host plant. The metabolites from the endophytes comprise maximum therapeutic properties and have been extensively applied in treating various diseases and disorders. This study was focused on identification of the endophytic fungi from the medicinal plant Blumea axillaris and investigates the diversity of endophytic fungi from various explants of the same plant. The explants were cultured on potato dextrose agar and 6 endophytic fungi were successfully isolated from Blumea axillaris. They were identified morphologically and confirmed with molecular analysis as Xylaria arbuscula, Paraphoma radicina, Phomopsis phaseoli, Sordaria fimicola, Aspergillus amstelodami, Diaporthe eucalyptorum. The DNA sequences were analyzed by BLAST and the phylogenetic tree was constructed with neighbor joining method. The six isolates were subjected to antagonistic activity for the selection of potential strain and the bioactive strain Xylaria arbuscula was selected for the production of secondary metabolites by optimization. The parameters like pH, temperature, incubation period, carbon and nitrogen (organic and inorganic source) were optimized for secondary metabolite production. The fungal metabolite was extracted by solvent extraction method using polar and non-polar solvents like propanol, methanol, chloroform, acetone and ethyl acetate. To investigate the bioactivities of the fungal crude extract was subjected first for its antioxidant activity using DPPH radical scavenging method, followed by antimicrobial activity of methanolic (MeOH) extract of Xylaria arbuscula, that were also analyzed by the agar well-diffusion method against the clinical pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pnuemoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans. © Articles by the authors; SHST, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.",Lavanya N.; Manon Mani V.; Saranya N.; Deepakkumar R.; Preethi K.,Notulae Scientia Biologicae,2021,10.15835/nsb13210953,0.972666820597097,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993673239828052,0.00632676017194754,0.999999980047948,1.99520522325969e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3382,Interactive effects of resource enrichment and resident diversity on invasion of native grassland by Lolium arundinaceum,"Resident diversity and resource enrichment are both recognized as potentially important determinants of community invasibility, but the effects of these biotic and abiotic factors on invasions are often investigated separately, and little work has been done to directly compare their relative effects or to examine their potential interactions. Here, we evaluate the individual and interactive effects of resident diversity and resource enrichment on plant community resistance to invasion. We factorially manipulated plant diversity and the enrichment of belowground (soil nitrogen) and aboveground (light) resources in low-fertility grassland communities invaded by Lolium arundinaceum, the most abundant invasive grass in eastern North America. Soil nitrogen enrichment enhanced L. arundinaceum performance, but increased resident diversity dampened this effect of nitrogen enrichment. Increased light availability (via clipping of aboveground vegetation) had a negligible effect on community invasibility. These results demonstrate that a community's susceptibility to invasion can be contingent upon the type of resource pulse and the diversity of resident species. In order to assess the generality of these results, future studies that test the effects of resident diversity and resource enrichment against a range of invasive species and in other environmental contexts (e.g., sites differing in soil fertility and light regimes) are needed. Such studies may help to resolve conflicting interpretations of the diversity-invasibility relationship and provide direction for management strategies.","Mattingly, WB; Swedo, BL; Reynolds, HL",PLANT ECOLOGY,2010,10.1007/s11258-009-9665-5,0.960275156782238,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985431311497443,0.0145686885025565,0.999999958763516,4.12364837831802e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The results showed that the IBA and the endophytic fungus Zasmidium syzygii elicitor could increase the content of podophyllotoxin of in vitro roots of D. versipellis after 3 weeks. The White medium added with 3 mg·L~(-1) IBA induced the highest increase of podophyllotoxin(1 830.86 μg·g~(-1)), which was 2.07 folds greater than the control, and followed by 1.5 mg·L~(-1) IBA, fungal elicitor, 1 mg·L~(-1) IBA, 0.5 mg·L~(-1) IBA and 4.5 mg·L~(-1) IBA, which was 1.82, 1.71, 1.63, 1.43 and 1.1 folds greater than the control, respectively. The results also showed that the growth of roots was certain positively correlated with the change of IBA concentration. Therefore, 3 mg·L~(-1) IBA was the most suitable for the production of podophyllotoxin in the in vitro roots of D. versipellis, and the stimulating effect of Z. syzygii fungal elicitor was between 1.5 mg·L~(-1) and 1 mg·L~(-1) IBA, which was a potential natural elicitor to induce the accumulation of podophyllotoxin in future production.",Tan X.-M.; Yu L.-Y.; Tang H.-Z.; Zhao L.-C.; Zhou Y.-Q.,Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,2019,10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190301.012,0.902332639338182,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.977870055384899,0.0221299446151013,0.999978023166456,2.19768335444348e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

13709,ASCOPHYLLUM NODOSUM (PHAEOPHYTA) IN AXENIC CULTURE AND ITS RESPONSE TO THE ENDOPHYTIC FUNGUS MYCOSPHAERELLA ASCOPHYLLI AND EPIPHYTIC BACTERIA,"Ascophyllum nodosum (L.) Le Jol. was freed from bacteria and the endophytic fungus Mycosphaerella ascophylli Cotton by repeated treatment with chlorine solutions and grown in artificial seawater. Two types of axenic culture of different origin were obtained. Type 1 was developed from apices of A. nodosum collected in the sea. Type 2 was from plants which developed from adventitious embryos on rhizoids formed by type 1. This is the first time A. nodosum has been cultivated axenically. Growth of the axenic alga was increased by IAA, 21P and zeatin. Without external growth regulators some strains of the axenic alga deteriorated within a year; others developed a filamentous habit. Sulfur in a reduced state also stimulated growth. Addition of either glucose, mannose or mannitol to the medium caused the formation of calluslike layers of loosely packed colorless cells under the epidermis of the thalli and the epidermis was sloughed off. No increase in thallus length was noticed. Mycosphaerella ascophylli in axenic culture did not excude any substances stimulating growth of the alga, but that does not exclude an influence of the fungus on the alga in vivo. The fungus, when growing within the alga, seemed to have little influence on algal morphology. A bacterized but fungus‐free A. nodosum was cultivated in an artificial seawater for 8 years. In the bacteria‐free alga, the fungus protruded from the epidermis and evidently utilized the alga as a carbon source. The bacteria thus seem much more important than the fungus for normal growth of the Ascophyllum plant. Copyright © 1988, Wiley Blackwell.

17256,Diversity of endophytic bacteria in Lolium perenne and their potential to degrade petroleum hydrocarbons and promote plant growth.,"The aim of this study was to assess the ability of twenty-nine endophytic bacteria isolated from the tissues of ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) to promote plant growth and the degradation of hydrocarbon. Most of the isolates belonged to the genus Pseudomonas and showed multiple plant growth-promoting abilities. All of the bacteria that were tested exhibited the ability to produce indole-3-acetic acid and were sensitive to streptomycin. These strains were capable of phosphate solubilization (62%), cellulolytic enzyme production (62%), a capacity for motility (55%) as well as for the production of siderophore (45%), ammonium (41%) and hydrogen cyanide (38%). Only five endophytes had the emulsification ability that results from the production of biosurfactants. The 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACCD) gene (acdS) was found in ten strains. These bacteria exhibited ACCD activities in the range from 1.8 to 56.6 μmol of α-ketobutyrate mg(-1)h(-1), which suggests that these strains may be able to modulate ethylene levels and enhance plant growth. The potential for hydrocarbon degradation was assessed by PCR amplification on the following genes: alkH, alkB, C23O, P450 and pah. The thirteen strains that were tested had the P450 gene but the alkH and pah genes were found only in the Rhodococcus fascians strain (L11).

5337,"INFECTION OF BEECH LEAVES (FAGUS-SYLVATICA) BY THE ENDOPHYTE DISCULA-UMBRINELLA (TELEOMORPH, APIOGNOMONIA-ERRABUNDA) - LOW-TEMPERATURE SCANNING ELECTRON-MICROSCOPY STUDIES","The sequence of events leading to infection by Discula umbrinella of leaves taken from axenically grown beech seedlings was studied at the ultrastructural level. On the host surface, even under optimal conditions and when contact with the host is established, only approximately 70% germination can be observed. In hanging drops containing malt extract, germination is only approximately 10%, suggesting that abundant nutrient supply alone is not enough to promote germination. Incubation of conidia in leaf extracts, on the other hand, results in the induction of germination even if no contact with an appropriate support is established. Between 16 and 24 h after infection four stages of germination can be observed on beech leaves: (i) ungerminated conidia; (ii) germinating conidia producing long superficial hyphae; (iii) conidia with distinct, appressorium-like swelling at the end of the germ tube; and (iv) germinated conidia with a halo around the tip of the germ tube. Transmission electron microscopy shows that subcuticular penetration into the host occurs at places where halos are seen. Apparently only germination with formation of appressorium-like structures and halos leads to successful penetration. Application of conidia to the abaxial side of the host leaf results in the formation of structures similar to those observed on the adaxial surface. Conidial germ tubes penetrate the cuticular layers of the outer edges of the guard cells, but direct penetration through the stomata was rarely observed. Appressorium or halo formation, observed only on the host surface and never on other substrates, suggests host-specific induction of penetrating structures. The mode of penetration observed for D. umbrinella bears some similarities with that described for some biotrophs and pathogens, suggesting affinities between endophytes and pathogens.","VIRET, O; SCHEIDEGGER, C; PETRINI, O",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE,1993,10.1139/b93-184,0.951735307279917,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998386589855302,0.00161341014469774,0.999995861715266,4.13828473411204e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

We also analysed the roles of the phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase MssD and the predicted phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5triphosphate 3-phosphatase TepA, a homolog of the mammalian tumour suppressor protein PTEN. Deletion of tepA in E. festucae and in the root-infecting tomato pathogen Fusarium oxysporum had no impact on growth in culture or the host interaction phenotype. However, this mutation did enable the detection of PI[3,4,5]P3 in septa and mycelium of E. festucae and showed that TepA is required for chemotropism in F. oxysporum. The identification of PI[3,4,5]P3 in Delta tepA strains suggests that filamentous fungi are able to generate PI[3,4,5]P3 and that fungal PTEN homologs are functional lipid phosphatases. The F. oxysporum chemotropism defect suggests a conserved role of PTEN homologs in chemotaxis across protists, fungi and mammals.","Hassing, B; Candy, A; Eaton, CJ; Fernandes, TR; Mesarich, CH; Di Pietro, A; Scott, B",FUNGAL GENETICS AND BIOLOGY,2022,10.1016/j.fgb.2022.103669,0.92723539422826,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.911154418374297,0.0888455816257031,0.999999999791844,2.08155825909273e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
8734,Digirseophene A promotes recovery in injured developing cerebellum via AMPK/AKT/GSK3 I3 pathway-mediated neural stem cell proliferation,"Neural stem cells (NSCs) exhibit a remarkable capacity for self-renewal and have the potential to differentiate into various neural lineage cells, which makes them pivotal in the management of neurological disorders. Harnessing the inherent potential of endogenous NSCs for enhancing nerve repair and regeneration represents an optimal approach to addressing diseases of the nervous system. In this study, we explored the potential of a novel benzophenone derivative named Digirseophene A (DGA), which was isolated from the endophytic fungus Corydalis tomentella. Previous experiments have extensively identified and characterized DGA, revealing its unique properties. Our findings demonstrate the remarkable capability of DGA to stimulate neural stem cell proliferation, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we established a model of radiation-induced cerebellar injury to assess the effects of DGA on the distribution of different cell subpopulations within the damaged cerebellum, thereby suggesting its beneficial role in cerebellar repair. In addition, our observations on a primary NSCs model revealed that DGA significantly increased cellular oxygen consumption, indicating increased energy and metabolic demands. By utilizing various pathway inhibitors in combination with DGA, we successfully demonstrated its ability to counteract the suppressive impacts of AMPK and GSK3I3 inhibitors on NSC proliferation. Collectively, our research results strongly suggest that DGA, as an innovative compound, exerts its role in activating NSCs and promoting injury repair through the regulation of the AMPK/AKT/GSK3I3 pathway.","Tang, XY; Huang, YT; Fu, WY; Wang, PB; Feng, LY; Yang, J; Zhu, HY; Huang, XN; Ming, QL; Li, P",BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY,2024,10.1016/j.biopha.2024.117046,0.99513429804231,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997652786464939,0.00234721353506083,0.99999944221025,5.57789750277315e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

18698,Strategies for increasing saikosaponins accumulation in Bupleurum: insights from environmental and microbial regulation.,"Suitable environments (low light, drought, adequate nutrients, moderate salinity, low temperature) and microorganisms (endophytic fungi, AMF, Trichoderma) promote saikosaponins accumulation by regulating key enzymes and transcription factors in biosynthetic pathways. Saikosaponins (SSs) are the principal bioactive constituents and crucial quality control markers in the genus Bupleurum. They possess diverse pharmacological activities, such as sedation, antipyretic, anticonvulsant, anti-inflammation, antitumor, antiviral, and hepatoprotection. The biosynthesis and accumulation of SSs are influenced by multiple factors, including abiotic environmental conditions (e.g., water, soil, light, and temperature) and microbial factors (such as endophytic fungi, mycorrhizal fungi, Trichoderma fungi and bacteria). Enzymes involved in SSs biosynthesis (e.g., HMGR, FPPS, IPPI, β-AS, P450, UGT) and transcription factors (e.g., ERF1-1, bHLH14, NAC53, WRKY6, WRKY16, WRKY32, WRKY40, etc.) play a key role in promoting the accumulation of SSs by these abiotic factors and microorganisms.

These fungi are seed-disseminated, thus stably maintained for many host generations. To investigate the possibility of long-term coevolution, isolates of E. typhina and anamorphs were obtained from eight grass species, sequences of their rRNA gene internal transcribed spacers were aligned with those from other Clavicipitaceae, and cladograms were generated by maximum parsimony. The results indicated that the nonpathogenic endophytes have not necessarily coevolved with their host species and that they arose from E. typhina on multiple occasions.","SCHARDL, CL; LIU, JS; WHITE, JF; FINKEL, RA; AN, ZQ; SIEGEL, MR",PLANT SYSTEMATICS AND EVOLUTION,1991,10.1007/BF00937980,0.986251747370287,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999672718434093,3.2728156590685e-4,0.99999999999762,2.37987407558649e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
4209,"Drought Stress Can Induce the Pathogenicity of Cryptostroma corticale, the Causal Agent of Sooty Bark Disease of Sycamore Maple","Reports of sooty bark disease of maples caused by the fungus Cryptostroma corticale have recently been emerging from across Europe. The aims of our study were to describe the first report of sooty bark disease in Slovenia, to determine the pathogenicity of C. corticale, to confirm the optimum temperature for the growth of the fungus, and to determine the mass loss of Acer pseudoplatanus wood inoculated by C. corticale. We confirmed the presence of C. corticale on A. pseudoplatanus via morphological and molecular analysis. The optimal growth of C. corticale was measured in vitro on potato dextrose agar and was determined to occur at 25 degrees C. Pathogenicity tests were performed on 30 saplings of A. pseudoplatanus under two treatments, humid and drought stress, and the fungus was pathogenic in both treatments. The mean length of bark lesions and wood discoloration of the drought-stressed saplings was significantly greater than that in the humid treatment. Re-isolations of C. corticale were successful from all inoculated saplings, and thus Koch's postulates were confirmed. The mass loss of A. pseudoplatanus wood was determined by mini-block test in a period of 10 weeks and was observed as minimal. Based on the results, we conclude that C. corticale is a weak and opportunistic pathogen that most likely expresses itself intensively under hot and dry conditions.","Ogris, N; Brglez, A; Piskur, B",FORESTS,2021,10.3390/f12030377,0.978091876821963,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99614883970154,0.00385116029846032,0.999999553187283,4.4681271671454e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5765,"Contingency rules for pathogen competition and antagonism in a genetically based, plant defense hierarchy","Plant defense against pathogens includes a range of mechanisms, including, but not limited to, genetic resistance, pathogen-antagonizing endophytes, and pathogen competitors. The relative importance of each mechanism can be expressed in a hierarchical view of defense. Several recent studies have shown that pathogen antagonism is inconsistently expressed within the plant defense hierarchy. Our hypothesis is that the hierarchy is governed by contingency rules that determine when and where antagonists reduce plant disease severity. Here, we investigated whether pathogen competition influences pathogen antagonism using Populus as a model system. In three independent field experiments, we asked whether competition for leaf mesophyll cells between a Melampsora rust pathogen and a microscopic, eriophyid mite affects rust pathogen antagonism by fungal leaf endophytes. The rust pathogen has an annual, phenological disadvantage in competition with the mite because the rust pathogen must infect its secondary host in spring before infecting Populus. We varied mite-rust competition by utilizing Populus genotypes characterized by differential genetic resistance to the two organisms. We inoculated plants with endophytes and allowed mites and rust to infect plants naturally. Two contingency rules emerged from the three field experiments: (a) Pathogen antagonism by endophytes can be preempted by host genes for resistance that suppress pathogen development, and (b) pathogen antagonism by endophytes can secondarily be preempted by competitive exclusion of the rust by the mite. Synthesis: Our results point to a Populus defense hierarchy with resistance genes on top, followed by pathogen competition, and finally pathogen antagonism by endophytes. We expect these rules will help to explain the variation in pathogen antagonism that is currently attributed to context dependency.","Busby, PE; Crutsinger, G; Barbour, M; Newcombe, G",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2019,10.1002/ece3.5253,0.960170621868993,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99854888133277,0.0014511186672301,0.999999999723457,2.76543343780133e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

17650,First Report of Penicillium griseofulvum Causing Blue Mold on Stored Apples in Italy (Piedmont).,"In northern Italy, blue mold can occur generally on apples after 3 months of storage under controlled atmospheres. The mold can be caused by Penicillium griseofulvum Dierckx (synonym P. urticae Bainier). During 2008, several postharvest fruit rots were observed on apples (cv. Golden Delicious) after 180 to 240 days of storage at 1°C. Approximately 8% of the fruits showed blue mold. Apples had been cultivated in Aosta (Aosta Valley Region) and Lagnasco (Piedmont Region). Infected fruits showed soft, watery, brown spots enlarging rapidly at 20°C. There was a distinct margin between soft rotted flesh and firm healthy tissues. Under high humidity, masses of blue-green spores formed on the surface of the lesion. Apple fruit excisions from the margin between the healthy and diseased tissues were plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA), pH 5.6. The recovered fungus produced abundant mycelium and conidia, with the colonies attaining a diameter of 2.0 to 2.4 cm after 7 days at 20 ± 2°C on PDA. Colonies were mostly yellow-green, with a yellowish-to-orange brown underside. Conidiophores were mononematous or loosely synnematous, hyaline, with branches strongly divergent. Phialides were cylindrical with a very short neck. Conidia were ellipsoidal, sometimes subglobose, 2.5 to 3.5 × 2.2 to 2.5 μm, hyaline to greenish. Preliminary morphological identification of the fungus (2) was confirmed by PCR using genomic DNA extracted from mycelia of pure cultures. Two sequences, obtained through the amplification of ribosomal region ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 (1), were blast searched in GenBank and showed 99% sequence coverage and 99% similarity to ribosomal sequences of P. griseofulvum. Two sequences were deposited in GenBank with Accession Nos. HQ012498 (a strain from Aosta Valley) and HQ012499 (a strain from the Piedmont Region). Pathogenicity was tested on 20 ripe fruits each of four apple cultivars (Golden Delicious, Red Chief, Granny Smith, and Royal Gala). Fruits were surface sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite. Conidial suspensions (30 μl of 105 conidia/ml) of the fungus were placed on artificial wounds generated on the apple surface. Control fruits were treated with sterile water. Seven days after inoculation, the symptoms were reproduced on the four cultivars and P. griseofulvum was reisolated on PDA from the inoculated fruits of all four cultivars. Control fruits were symptomless. An analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array of the rotting tissues associated with inoculated fruits of all four cultivars (4) confirmed, as in the case of other strains of P. griseofulvum, the production of the mycotoxin patulin (12.1 to 44.4 mg kg-1). Previously, P. griseofulvum was reported on apple in other countries such as the United States (3), Japan, Egypt, and Brazil. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. griseofulvum on apples during storage in Italy. References: (1) R. Nilsson et al. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 296:97, 2009. (2) R. A. Samson and J. L. Pitt.

1977,How Does Salinity Shape Bacterial and Fungal Microbiomes of Alnus glutinosa Roots?,"Black alder (Alnus glutinosa Gaertn.) belongs to dual mycorrhizal trees, forming ectomycorrhizal (EM) and arbuscular (AM) root structures, as well as represents actinorrhizal plants that associate with nitrogen-fixing actinomycete Frankia sp. We hypothesized that the unique ternary structure of symbionts can influence community structure of other plant-associated microorganisms (bacterial and fungal endophytes), particularly under seasonally changing salinity in A. glutinosa roots. In our study we analyzed black alder root bacterial and fungal microbiome present at two forest test sites (saline and non-saline) in two different seasons (spring and fall). The dominant type of root microsymbionts of alder were ectomycorrhizal fungi, whose distribution depended on site (salinity): Tomentella, Lactarius, and Phialocephala were more abundant at the saline site. Mortierella and Naucoria (representatives of saprotrophs or endophytes) displayed the opposite tendency. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi belonged to Glomeromycota (orders Paraglomales and Glomales), however, they represented less than 1% of all identified fungi. Bacterial community structure depended on test site but not on season. Sequences affiliated with Rhodanobacter, Granulicella, and Sphingomonas dominated at the saline site, while Bradyrhizobium and Rhizobium were more abundant at the non-saline site. Moreover, genus Frankia was observed only at the saline site. In conclusion, bacterial and fungal community structure of alder root microsymbionts and endophytes depends on five soil chemical parameters: salinity, phosphorus, pH, saturation percentage (SP) as well as total organic carbon (TOC), and seasonality does not appear to be an important factor shaping microbial communities. Ectomycorrhizal fungi are the most abundant symbionts of mature alders growing in saline soils. However, specific distribution of nitrogen-fixing Frankia (forming root nodules) and association of arbuscular fungi at early stages of plant development should be taken into account in further studies.","Thiem, D; Golebiewski, M; Hulisz, P; Piernik, A; Hrynkiewicz, K",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2018,10.3389/fmicb.2018.00651,0.97318498617949,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.952789964258218,0.0472100357417817,0.999999908859278,9.1140722413563e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10449,"The ectomycorrhizal morphotype Pinirhiza sclerotia is formed by Acephala macrosclerotiorum sp nov., a close relative of Phialocephala fortinii","Relatively few ectomycorrhizal fungal species are known to form sclerotia. Usually, sclerotia are initiated at the extraradical mycelium. In this study, we present anatomical and ultrastructural evidence for the formation of sclerotia directly in the hyphal mantle of the mycorrhizal morphotype Pinirhiza sclerotia. A dark-pigmented fungal strain was isolated from Pinirhiza sclerotia and identified by molecular tools as Acephala macrosclerotiorum sp. nov., a close relative of Phialocephala fortinii s.l. As dark septate fungi are known to be mostly endophytic, resyntheses with Pinus sylvestris and A. macrosclerotiorum as well as Populus tremula x Populus tremuloides and A. macrosclerotiorum or P. fortinii s.l. were performed under axenic conditions. No mycorrhizas were found when hybrid aspen was inoculated with A. macrosclerotiorum or P. fortinii. However, A. macrosclerotiorum formed true ectomycorrhizas in vitro with P. sylvestris. Anatomical and ultrastructural features of this ectomycorrhiza are presented. The natural and synthesized ectomycorrhizal morphotypes were identical and characterized by a thin hyphal mantle that bore sclerotia in a later ontogenetic stage. The Hartig net was well-developed and grew up to the endodermis. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence at the anatomical and ultrastructural level that a close relative of P. fortinii s.l. forms true ectomycorrhizas with a coniferous host.","Münzenberger, B; Bubner, B; Wöllecke, J; Sieber, TN; Bauer, R; Fladung, M; Hüttl, RF",MYCORRHIZA,2009,10.1007/s00572-009-0239-0,0.979715635562073,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.959096526130269,0.0409034738697311,0.92825300308619,0.0717469969138103,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
322,Endophytic fungi from Chilean native gymnosperms: antimicrobial activity against human and phytopathogenic fungi,"Thirty-eight endophytic fungi were isolated from eight Chilean gymnosperms. Isolates were characterized and grouped according to culture characteristics, colony growth, and conidia morphology. Thirteen isolates were identified: Acremonium bacillisporum, A. bactrocephalum, A. strictum, Alternaria alternata, Aureobasidium pullulans, Chaetomium funicola, Cladosporium tenuissimum, Curvularia protuberata, C. tritici, Microsphaeropsis olivacea, Penicillium chrysogenum, P. janczewskii, and Triblidiopycnis pinastri. Malbranchea and Stegonosporium were identified at the genus level. Fourteen isolates, considered to be sterile mycelia, did not fructify in the culture medium. Crude extracts of liquid cultures from endophytes were examined for antibacterial and antifungal activity against bacteria and phytopathogenic fungi using agar diffusion. Antifungal activity against pathogenic fungi was determined by microdilution assays. Extracts of Acremonium bactrocephalum, Microsphaeropsis olivacea, and isolate E-3 inhibited growth of selected pathogenic organisms, indicating they merit further study. This is the first comparative report on the antimicrobial activity of endophytic fungi from Chilean gymnosperms.","Hormazabal, E; Piontelli, E",WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY,2009,10.1007/s11274-008-9953-6,0.974958243565988,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999895371446302,1.0462855369833e-4,0.999999999999865,1.34559030584569e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
4157,Using soil microbial inoculations to enhance substrate performance on extensive green roofs,"Green roofs are increasing in popularity in the urban environment for their contribution to green infrastructure; but their role for biodiversity is not often a design priority. Maximising biodiversity will impact positively on ecosystem services and is therefore fundamental for achieving the greatest benefits from green roofs. Extensive green roofs are lightweight systems generally constructed with a specialised growing medium that tends to be biologically limited and as such can be a harsh habitat for plants to thrive in. Thus, this investigation aimed to enhance the soil functioning with inoculations of soil microbes to increase plant diversity, improve vegetation health/performance and maximise access to soil nutrients. Manipulations included the addition of mycorrhizal fungi and a microbial mixture ('compost tea') to green roof rootzones, composed mainly of crushed brick or crushed concrete. The study revealed that growing media type and depth play a vital role in the microbial ecology of green roofs, with complex relationships between depth and type of substrate and the type of microbial inoculant applied, with no clear pattern being observed. For bait plant measurements (heights, leaf numbers, root/shoot biomass, leaf nutrients), a compost tea may have positive effects on plant performance when grown in substrates of shallower depths (5.5 cm), even one year after inoculums are applied. Results from the species richness surveys show that diversity was significantly increased with the application of an AM fungal treatment and that overall, results suggest that brick-based substrate blends are most effective for vegetation performance as are deeper depths (although this varied with time). Microbial inoculations of green roof habitats appeared to be sustainable; they need only be done once for benefits to still been seen in subsequent years where treatments are added independently (not in combination). They seem to be a novel and viable method of enhancing rooftop conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

20597,Isolation and identification of entophytic antagonistic fungus from Aloe barbadensis,"Aloe barbadensis was famous for its high pharmaceutical value and health function because of the variable antimicrobial materials existing in its tissue. In order to explore the endophytic fungi resources in Aloe barbadensis, a total of 318 endophytic fungi strains were isolated from the wild samples which were collected from Yuanjiang (Yunnan Province). One strain (F80) showed a broad antimicrobial spectrum by plate osmose processing and plate confronting screen methods. The antagonistic test showed that strain F80 had remarkable inhibiting effect on some plant pathogens such as Fusarium oxysporium, Macrophoma kawatsukai, Alternaria alternate and Gibberella saubinetii and the inhibiting rate was 70%, 76%, 86% and 84% Respectively. The ITS DNA regions of F80 was PCR and sequenced. The ITS phylogenetic tree of strain F80 was constructed by comparing with the published ITS sequences of the relative fungi species. Morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics and ITS sequence analysis proved that F80 was identified to be Trichoderma harzianum. The strain F80 showed broad and obvious inhibition activity on plant pathogenic fungi in this study, which exhibited a good application prospect. In addition, the inhibition modes of strain F80 were investigated preliminarily in this research through these elementary studying and discussing.",Wang L.-H.; Ma Y.; Ke Y.; Li B.,Chinese Journal of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology,2013,NA,0.857886597574577,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.563830556177702,0.436169443822298,0.999643977044485,3.5602295551517e-4,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
2855,Subterranean structures and mycotrophy of the achlorophyllous Triuris hyalina (Triuridaceae),"Triuris hyalina Miers, an unusual achlorophyllous plant, was investigated for subterranean morphology, root anatomy, and mycotrophy. Stems with scale leaves extend subterraneously to a depth of 15 cm. Pairs of adventitious roots develop at the scale leaves and clumps of apparently radiating roots, formed by accumulations of side shoot and scale leaf developments, occur. Roots consist of epidermis, short cell exodermis, three distinct layers of cortex parenchyma, endodermis, and an extremely reduced central cylinder with one or two central tracheidal xylem elements. The fungus associated with T. hyalina roots exhibits thick-walled, 6-9 mu m thick, aseptate external hyphae. It penetrates the epidermis by developing appressoria and enters the cortex solely through the short cells of the exodermis. In the cortex cells, the aseptate hyphae start to coil. In the outer cortex layer, hyphae are thin, frequently branched, and most densely coiled. In the middle cortex layer they are thicker and less densely coiled, and mostly appear degenerated to clumps of amorphous fungal material. The inner cortex layer rarely becomes colonized. Vesicles occur in the outer and the middle cortex layers. This mycorrhizal pattern is interpreted as an adaption to attain a sustainable use from the endophyte. It is suggested that the mycorrhiza in Triuris hyalina be interpreted as a type of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM). Implications for systematics and ecology are discussed.","Imhof, S",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE,1998,10.1139/b98-168,0.872177369427025,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990327727066605,0.0096722729333947,0.999999920889907,7.91100928099198e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19301,Biocontrol of plant pathogens in omics era-with special focus on endophytic bacilli.,"Nearly all plants and their organs are inhabited by endophytic microbes which play a crucial role in plant fitness and stress resilience. Harnessing endophytic services can provide effective solutions for a sustainable increase in agriculture productivity and can be used as a complement or alternative to agrochemicals. Shifting agriculture practices toward the use of nature-based solutions can contribute directly to the global challenges of food security and environmental sustainability. However, microbial inoculants have been used in agriculture for several decades with inconsistent efficacy. Key reasons of this inconsistent efficacy are linked to competition with indigenous soil microflora and inability to colonize plants. Endophytic microbes provide solutions to both of these issues which potentially make them better candidates for microbial inoculants. This article outlines the current advancements in endophytic research with special focus on endophytic bacilli. A better understanding of diverse mechanisms of disease control by bacilli is essential to achieve maximum biocontrol efficacy against multiple phytopathogens. Furthermore, we argue that integration of emerging technologies with strong theoretical frameworks have the potential to revolutionize biocontrol approaches based on endophytic microbes.",Ahmed A; He P; He Y; Singh BK; Wu Y; Munir S; He P,Critical reviews in biotechnology,2024,10.1080/07388551.2023.2183379,0.870982969871187,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.328062817155558,0.671937182844442,0.997536602904622,0.00246339709537824,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
19065,The limitless endophytes: their role as antifungal agents against top priority pathogens.,"Multi resistant fungi are on the rise, and our arsenal compounds are limited to few choices in the market such as polyenes, pyrimidine analogs, azoles, allylamines, and echinocandins. Although each of these drugs featured a unique mechanism, antifungal resistant strains did emerge and continued to arise against them worldwide. Moreover, the genetic variation between fungi and their host humans is small, which leads to significant challenges in new antifungal drug discovery. Endophytes are still an underexplored source of bioactive secondary metabolites. Many studies were conducted to isolate and screen endophytic pure compounds with efficacy against resistant yeasts and fungi; especially, Candida albicans, C. auris, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus, which encouraged writing this review to critically analyze the chemical nature, potency, and fungal source of the isolated endophytic compounds as well as their novelty features and SAR when possible. Herein, we report a comprehensive list of around 320 assayed antifungal compounds against Candida albicans, C. auris, Cryptococcus neoformans and Aspergillus fumigatus in the period 1980-2024, the majority of which were isolated from fungi of orders Eurotiales and Hypocreales associated with terrestrial plants, probably due to the ease of laboratory cultivation of these strains. 46% of the reviewed compounds were active against C. albicans, 23% against C. neoformans, 29% against A. fumigatus and only 2% against C. auris. Coculturing was proved to be an effective technique to induce cryptic metabolites absent in other axenic cultures or host extract cultures, with Irperide as the most promising compounds MIC value 1 μg/mL. C. auris was susceptible to only persephacin and rubiginosin C. The latter showed potent inhibition against this recalcitrant strain in a non-fungicide way, which unveils the potential of fungal biofilm inhibition.

8090,"Novel resources of Taxol from endophytic and entomopathogenic fungi: Isolation, characterization and LC-Triple mass spectrometric quantification","This work presents a second-to-none method for Taxol isolation from the Endophytic fungus Cladosporium sphaerospermum (AUMC 6896) and the Entomopathogenic fungus Metarizium anisopliae (AUMC 5130). The extracts were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using positive electrospray ionization (ESI) in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. This is rapid, consistent, reproducible, accurate, and sensitive for quantifying Taxol across multiple samples. The yield of crude Taxol product obtained from Potato Dextrose broth (PDB) medium inoculated with Cladosporium sphaerospermu and Metarizium anisopliae was found to be 3.732, and 0.0023 mu g L-1 respectively. The yield can be improved by adding ammonium acetate or salicylic acid to the culture broth. Addition of ammonium acetate (AA) (20 mg L-1) to culture media resulted in an increase of Taxol yield to 30.365 and 27.289 mu g L-1 respectively. Production of Taxol was 29.844 and 67.254 mu g L-1 for the two fungus species when ammonium acetate was substituted by 90 mg L-1 salicylic acid (SA). Adding both AA (20 mg L-1) and SA (90 mg L-1) to the culture media resulted in an increase of the Taxol yield to 4.054 and 116.373 mu g L-1 respectively. Our proposed analytical method offers very fast (3 min) quantitation of Taxol in comparison with other published methods.

410,The culturable endophytic fungal communities of switchgrass grown on a coal-mining site and their effects on plant growth,"Plants have a diverse endophytic microbiome that is functionally important for their growth, development, and health. In this study, the diversity and specificity of culturable endophytic fungal communities were explored in one of the most important biofuel crops, switchgrass plants (Panicum virgatum L.), which have been cultivated on a reclaimed coal-mining site for more than 20 years. The endophytic fungi were isolated from the surface-sterilized shoot (leaf and stem), root, and seed tissues of switchgrass plants and then cultured for identification. A total of 1339 fungal isolates were found and 22 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were sequence identified by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primers and grouped into 7 orders and 4 classes. Although a diverse range of endophytic fungi associated with switchgrass were documented, the most abundant class, order, and species were Sordariomycetes, Hypocreales, and Fusarium spp. respectively. About 86% of the isolated endophytic fungi were able to enhance the heights of the shoots; 69% could increase the shoot fresh weights; and 62% could improve the shoot dry weights after being reintroduced back into the switchgrass plants, which illustrated their functional importance. Through the Shannon Diversity Index analysis, we observed a gradation of species diversity, with shoots and roots having the similar values and seeds having a lesser value. It was observed that the switchgrass plants showing better growth performance displayed higher endophytic fungal species diversity and abundance. It was also discovered that the rhizosphere soil organic matter content was positively correlated with the fungal species diversity. All these data demonstrate the functional association of these beneficial endophytic fungi with switchgrass and their great potential in improving the switchgrass growth and biomass to benefit the biofuel industry by reducing chemical inputs and burden to the environment.","Xia, Y; Amna, A; Opiyo, SO",PLOS ONE,2018,10.1371/journal.pone.0198994,0.927518058209746,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995345846032366,0.00465415396763424,0.999999963135422,3.68645782788946e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

1864,Previous crop and rotation history effects on maize seedling health and associated rhizosphere microbiome,"To evaluate crop rotation effects on maize seedling performance and its associated microbiome, maize plants were grown in the greenhouse in soils preceded by either maize, pea, soybean or sunflower. Soils originated from a replicated field experiment evaluating different four-year rotation combinations. In the greenhouse, a stressor was introduced by soil infestation with western corn rootworm (WCR) or Fusarium graminearum. Under non-infested conditions, maize seedlings grown in soils preceded by sunflower or pea had greater vigor. Stress with WCR or F. graminearum resulted in significant root damage. WCR root damage was equivalent for seedlings regardless of soil provenance; whereas F. graminearum root damage was significantly lower in maize grown in soils preceded by sunflower. Infestation with WCR affected specific microbial taxa (Acinetobacter, Smaragdicoccus, Aeromicrobium, Actinomucor). Similarly, F. graminearum affected fungal endophytes including Trichoderma and Endogone. In contrast to the biological stressors, rotation sequence had a greater effect on rhizosphere microbiome composition, with larger effects observed for fungi compared to bacteria. In particular, relative abundance of Glomeromycota was significantly higher in soils preceded by sunflower or maize. Defining the microbial players involved in crop rotational effects in maize will promote selection and adoption of favorable crop rotation sequences.","Benitez, MS; Osborne, SL; Lehman, RM",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2017,10.1038/s41598-017-15955-9,0.8349368530829,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997234102841779,0.00276589715822081,0.999999331159559,6.68840440698482e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
861,Fungal community associated with adults of the chestnut gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus after emergence from galls: Taxonomy and functional ecology,"The diversity of the fungal community associated with adults of Dryocosmus kuriphilus following emergence was examined using HTS analysis. Ascomycota dominated the fungal core-biome community. The functional guilds of the 90 taxa forming the core-biome were assessed, demonstrating three main groups: saprotrophs, plant pathogens and entomopathogens. Twenty-nine OTUs out of 90 were resolved to species level identifying 26 different fungal species. Among these species, many were cosmopolitan or previously recorded in Europe. Ten taxa were previously recorded on chestnut, including some recognized plant pathogens associated with foliage and green tissues such as Epicoccum nigrum, Gnomoniopsis castanea, Colletotrichum acutatum, Stromatoseptoria castaneicola, Ramularia endophylla. Beauveria bassiana; within the core microbiome, Fusarium larvarum represented the most abundant entomopathogenic species. Some of these species are known to impact directly or indirectly the vitality of the insects in the galls. The chestnut blight pathogen, Cryphonectria parasitica, was never found associated with D. kuriphilus. Based on the present study, an active role for D. kuriphilus as a vector of chestnut fungal endophyte/pathogens cannot be demonstrated but neither ruled out. (C) 2019 British Mycological Society.
