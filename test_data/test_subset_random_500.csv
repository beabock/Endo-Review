2671,Endophytic Communities of Transgenic Poplar Were Determined by the Environment and Niche Rather Than by Transgenic Events,"Microbial communities associated with plants represent key determinants of plant health, survival, and growth. However, a good understanding of the structural composition of the bacterial and fungal microbiome present in different plant tissues and growing environments, especially in transgenic woody plants, is required. In the present study, we hypothesized that environmental conditions, ecological niches, and transgenic events could influence the community structure of plant-associated microorganisms (bacterial and fungal endophytes). We sampled the root and stem endospheres of field-grown transgenic and non-transgenic poplar trees (Populus alba x P. berolinensis) and applied 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer amplicon Illumina MiSeq sequencing to determine the bacterial and fungal communities associated with the different plant habitats and tissues. We found that actinobacteria, proteobacteria, bacteroidetes, and firmicutes were the dominant endophytic bacteria, and the fungal community was dominated by dothideomycetes, agaricomycetes, leotiomycetes, and sordariomycetes. In conclusion, transgenic events did not affect the endophytic bacterial and fungal diversity of poplar trees. The bacterial and fungal community structure depends on the pH and the soil organic matter content. Each plant tissue represents a unique ecological niche for the microbial communities. Finally, we identified the indicator operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and core microbiome associated with the different plant tissues of Populus and different environmental conditions. The results provide a basis for further study of host-microbial interactions with the identified abundant OTUs of Populus.","Wang, YB; Zhang, WX; Ding, CJ; Zhang, BY; Huang, QJ; Huang, RF; Su, XH",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2019,10.3389/fmicb.2019.00588,0.960293607081293,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999725293947383,2.747060526171e-4,0.999999197641747,8.02358252949276e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
4784,Morphological and molecular characterization of Neopestalotiopsis vitis associated with leaf blight disease of Manilkara zapota-a new record from India,"Sapota is an important horticultural crop grown in India, and Karnataka is a major producer of sapota. A characteristic leaf blight disease was observed in Southern Karnataka during field surveys conducted in 2019 with an incidence of 13-22% in approximately 45 ha of sapota field. The leaf blight-associated pathogen was isolated on the potato dextrose agar medium. A total of 12 isolates obtained from each location were identified culturally and morphologically. Based on the morphological and cultural features, the pathogen was identified as Pestalotiopsis or Neopestalotiopsis, which was further confirmed by molecular identification using a representative isolate (MZ03). The ITS rDNA and beta-tubulin genes were amplified and sequenced using ITS1/ITS4 and T1/T22 primer pairs respectively. nBLAST search analysis and concatenated (ITS-rDNA and TUB2 loci) phylogenetic analysis confirmed the pathogen identity as Neopestalotiopsis vitis. Pathogenicity tests conducted on detached leaves by inoculation with a conidial suspension of N. vitis produced typical blight symptoms after 4-5 days and progressed to cover the entire leaf lamina after 10-12 days. The pathogen's identity was confirmed after re-isolation by cultural and morphological features. Although Pestalotiopsis clavispora and Pestalotiopsis versicolor causing diseases on sapota seedlings and trees have been reported, no reports are available for the occurrence of N. vitis to sapota from India. This is the first report of N. vitis associated with leaf blight disease of sapota from India.","Nuthan, BR; Meghavarshinigowda, BR; Maharachchikumbura, SSN; Mahadevakumar, S; Marulasiddaswamy, KM; Sunilkumar, CR; Amruthesh, KN; Satish, S",LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY,2021,10.1111/lam.13521,0.900864701814213,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.975714938791919,0.0242850612080807,0.999999999679221,3.20779069973298e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12032,Stroke preventing effect of resveratrol isolated from fungi and in vivo activity in male albino rats,"The main objective of the study was to analyze the stroke preventing property of resveratrol from Alternaria alternata SK. The endophytic fungus A. alternata SK was isolated from the Brinjal plant. The isolated fungus was characterized based on morphological characters and molecular methods. It was cultured in submerged cultivation and resveratrol was isolated. The isolated resveratrol was used to test stroke preventing properties using animal model. The experimental male Albino rat fed with resveratrol decreased HDL cholesterol level in serum. The amount of malondialdehyde significantly lower in the cardiac tissues of Albino AD rat treated with resveratrol (P < 0.05). Likewise, the level of malondialdehyde in the haemolysate sample showed significant variation than control animal (P < 0.05). Administered resveratrol improved antioxidant potential. The amount of antioxidant enzymes such as, SOD, CAT and GPx significantly higher in resveratrol administered Albino rats (P < 0.05) than control rat. The amount of GSH, a-tocopherol and ascorbate in cardiac muscle of AD rats fed with resveratrol increased significantly than in AD Albino rats (P < 0.05). The amount of aspartate amino transferase, alanine amino transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenate were reduced in experimental rats treated with resveratrol than control (P < 0.05). The experimental group treated with resveratrol decreased the level of LDH (1.63 +/- 0.128 nmol NADPH/mg) than ischemia group (2.08 +/- 0.11 nmol NADPH/mg) (P < 0.05). The amount of H2O2 was found to be high in ischemia group (428.2 +/- 2.9 nmol) and it reduced (320.3 +/- 10. 2 nmol) in resveratrol treated animal (P < 0.05).

13170,"Anatomical relations among endophytic holoparasitic angiosperms, autotrophic host plants and mycorrhizal fungi: A novel tripartite interaction","Mycorrhizae are widespread mutualistic symbioses crucial for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Not all plants associate with mycorrhizae; most parasitic plants have been suggested to be nonmycorrhizal because they have developed alternative strategies to obtain nutrients. In endophytic parasitic plants, whose vegetative bodies grow completely inside their mycorrhizal host roots, the opportunity for establishing a tripartite association seems evident, but information on these systems is lacking. In studying natural associations among the endophytic holoparasite Cytinus hypocistis, their Cistaceae host species, and associated mycorrhizal fungi, we found that mycorrhizae were associated with the hosts and the parasites, reaching high frequencies of colonization. In parasitic and host root tissues, mycorrhizal fungi spread in the parenchymatic cells by intracellular growth and formed hyphal coils and vesicles, while the cambium and the vascular tissues were never colonized. This report is the first on a tripartite association of an endophytic parasitic plant, its host, and mycorrhizae in natural conditions, representing a novel trophic interaction not previously reported within the angiosperms. Additional studies on the interactions occurring among these three players are needed because they may be crucial to our understanding of how this mutualistic-antagonistic system is functioning and evolving. © 2010 Botanical Society of America.",de Vega C.; Arista M.; Ortiz P.L.; Talavera S.,American Journal of Botany,2010,10.3732/ajb.0900147,0.885851889280919,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.971358440208158,0.0286415597918419,0.99999998963007,1.03699296927218e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5773,Biological management of rhizome rot in ginger ( Zingiber officinale) plants and stored ginger seeds,"Two endospore-forming endophytic bacteria (EEB1 A8 and EEB2 B13) were isolated from ginger rhizome collected from the fields of College of Agriculture, Vellayani and identified as Bacillus spp. Their antagonistic potential against Pythium myriotylum, the soft rot pathogen of ginger, was analyzed in vitro by dual culture plate assay and the agar well diffusion method. They tested positive for biocontrol traits such as the production of hydrogen cyanide, siderophore and volatile organic compounds. The bacterial isolates were applied to ginger plants to test biocontrol efficiency against P. myriotylum, individually and in combination with Piriformospora indica, a fungal root endophyte capable of promoting plant growth and enhancing plant defense. A lesser percent disease index (PDI) was observed in plants where the combination of EEB1 A8 and P. indica was applied. The activity of enzymes pertinent to protective mechanisms against pathogens, like peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, super oxide dismutase (SOD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) in the plants were analyzed before challenging, 1st, 3 rd and 5 th day after challenging with pathogen. The values followed the same trend in all treatments as it increased after inoculation up to 3 rd day and then decreased for peroxidase (PO) and SOD. The plants treated with EEB1 A8 and combination of EEB1 A8 and P. indica showed the highest values for the level of defense enzyme production. In a storage study, when ginger seed rhizomes were treated with individual bacterial isolates and as a consortium of both, followed by inoculation with the pathogen P. myriotylum, rhizomes treated with consortium were more tolerant to rhizome rot. Applying endospore-forming bacteria with biocontrol properties is a propitious method for controlling rhizome rot in ginger, in the field and during seed storage.","Nandana, MS; Anith, KN",PLANT SCIENCE TODAY,2024,10.14719/pst.4288,0.99231693024511,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99909432452603,9.0567547396978e-4,0.999999999566464,4.33536317956396e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The aim of this study was thus to determine the efficacy of this treatment in eliminating fungal endophytes from grapevine cuttings. The number of fungal colonies isolated from the hot-water treated cuttings 6 months after planting were not, however, significantly different (P=0.05) from that of the untreated cuttings. This was in contrast to where isolations were made directly after treatment, when no known living fungal pathogens were found inside treated vine tissue.

17396,"Quantitative PCR reveals strong spatial and temporal variation of the wasting disease pathogen, Labyrinthula zosterae in northern European eelgrass (Zostera marina) beds.","Seagrass beds are the foundation species of functionally important coastal ecosystems worldwide. The world's largest losses of the widespread seagrass Zostera marina (eelgrass) have been reported as a consequence of wasting disease, an infection with the endophytic protist Labyrinthula zosterae. During one of the most extended epidemics in the marine realm, ∼90% of East and Western Atlantic eelgrass beds died-off between 1932 and 1934. Today, small outbreaks continue to be reported, but the current extent of L. zosterae in European meadows is completely unknown. In this study we quantify the abundance and prevalence of the wasting disease pathogen among 19 Z. marina populations in northern European coastal waters, using quantitative PCR (QPCR) with primers targeting a species specific portion of the internally transcribed spacer (ITS1) of L. zosterae. Spatially, we found marked variation among sites with abundances varying between 0 and 126 cells mg(-1) Z. marina dry weight (mean: 5.7 L. zosterae cells mg(-1) Z. marina dry weight ±1.9 SE) and prevalences ranged from 0-88.9%. Temporarily, abundances varied between 0 and 271 cells mg(-1) Z. marina dry weight (mean: 8.5±2.6 SE), while prevalences ranged from zero in winter and early spring to 96% in summer. Field concentrations accessed via bulk DNA extraction and subsequent QPCR correlated well with prevalence data estimated via isolation and cultivation from live plant tissue. L. zosterae was not only detectable in black lesions, a sign of Labyrinthula-induced necrosis, but also occurred in green, apparently healthy tissue. We conclude that L. zosterae infection is common (84% infected populations) in (northern) European eelgrass populations with highest abundances during the summer months.

Many studies indicated that nanoparticles can boost the production of secondary metabolites. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of eco-friendly silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on the growth and productivity of Peucedanum praeruptorum Dunn. Initially, the AgNPs were synthesized by an endophytic fungus Diaporthe zaofenghuang from P. praeruptorum and their physicochemical attributes were identified, including their spherical shape, size ranging from 40 to 80 nm in diameter, and the presence of reducing-capping groups such as hydroxyl, carbonyl and phenolic. Following this, six-week-old P. praeruptorum seedlings were sprayed with AgNPs at 0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mg L-1 for 50 days. Compared with untreated and higher dose AgNPs-treated seedlings, the application of 12.5 mg L-1 AgNPs significantly improved plant performance (chlorophyll contents, root/shoot length, and the fresh/dry weights), and increased antioxidant enzyme activities and accumulation of nonenzymatic antioxidants (total phenols, flavonoids, and praeruptorin A and B). Further, metabolomic analysis unveiled that the AgNPs induced metabolic reprogramming in P. praeruptorum . Among these changes, tyrosine exhibited a significant down-regulation, likely influencing the synthesis of imperatorin which has been shown to be an important coumarin marker in P. praeruptorum . The findings suggest the usefulness of AgNPs in the breeding of P. praeruptorum can regulate the production of bioactive compounds, which can enhance the medicinal quality of crude drugs derived from P. praeruptorum .","Huang, SR; Wu, YX; Tian, W; Shen, WS; Dong, JY",INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS,2024,10.1016/j.indcrop.2024.119155,0.964479118597369,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.9985900400275,0.00140995997249995,0.999999999984121,1.58794088989112e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Horstmann as a novel source of the anticancer pro-drug deoxypodophyllotoxin","Aims: Isolation, identification and characterization of an endophytic fungus from Juniperus communis L. Horstmann, as a novel producer of deoxypodophyllotoxin and its in vitro antimicrobial assay. Methods and Results: The methodology for the isolation, identification and characterization of a novel endophytic fungus from the twigs of the J. communis L. Horstmann plant, which specifically and consistently produces deoxypodophyllotoxin, was unequivocally established. The fungus was identified as Aspergillus fumigatus Fresenius by molecular, morphological and physiological methods. Deoxypodophyllotoxin was identified and quantified by high-resolution LC-MS, LC-MS2 and LC-MS3. The antimicrobial efficacy of the fungal deoxypodophyllotoxin against a panel of pathogenic bacteria was established. Conclusions: The production of deoxypodophyllotoxin (found in the host) by the cultured endophyte is an enigmatic observation. It demonstrates the transfer of gene(s) for such accumulation by horizontal means from the host plant to its endophytic counterpart. It would be interesting to further study the deoxypodophyllotoxin production and regulation by the cultured endophyte in J. communis and in axenic cultures. Significance and Impact of the Study: This endophyte is a potential handle for scientific and commercial exploitation. Although the current accumulation of deoxypodophyllotoxin by the endophyte is not very high, it could be scaled-up to provide adequate production to satisfy new drug development and clinical needs. However, further refined precursor-feeding and mass-balance studies are required to result in the consistent and dependable production.","Kusari, S; Lamshöft, M; Spiteller, M",JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY,2009,10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04285.x,0.654949062809089,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.850362744580516,0.149637255419484,0.999983502593826,1.6497406174043e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
10721,Gall- and erineum-forming Eriophyes mites alter photosynthesis and volatile emissions in an infection severity-dependent manner in broad-leaved trees Alnus glutinosa and Tilia cordata,"Highly host-specific eriophyoid gall- and erineum-forming mites infest a limited range of broadleaf species, with the mites from the genus Eriophyes particularly widespread on Alnus spp. and Tilia spp. Once infected, the infections can be massive, covering a large part of leaf area and spreading through the plant canopy, but the effects of Eriophyes mite gall formation on the performance of host leaves are poorly understood. We studied the influence of three frequent Eriophyes infections, E. inangulis gall-forming mites on Alnus glutinosa, and E. tiliae gall-forming and E. exilis erineum-forming mites on Tilia cordata, on foliage morphology, chemistry, photosynthetic characteristics, and constitutive and induced volatile emissions. For all types of infections, leaf dry mass per unit area, net assimilation rate per area and stomatal conductance strongly decreased with increasing severity of infection. Mite infections resulted in enhancement or elicitation of emissions of fatty acid-derived volatiles, isoprene, benzenoids and carotenoid breakdown products in an infection severity-dependent manner for all different infections. Monoterpene emissions were strongly elicited in T. cordata mite infections, but these emissions were suppressed in E. inangulis-infected A. glutinosa. Although the overall level of mite-induced emissions was surprisingly low, these results highlight the uniqueness of the volatile profiles and offer opportunities for using volatile fingerprints and overall emission rates to diagnose infections by Eriophyes gall- and erineum-forming mites on temperate trees and assess their impact on the physiology of the affected trees.","Jiang, YF; Ye, JY; Veromann-Jürgenson, LL; Niinemets, Ü",TREE PHYSIOLOGY,2021,10.1093/treephys/tpaa173,0.966992901717629,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998230900830345,0.00176909916965496,0.999999933351564,6.66484363254227e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Endophytic fungi from unique habitats are considered as potential sources of novel bioactive compounds. Sri Lankan mangrove ecosystem is such a distinctive and unexploited resource for the discovery of structurally diverse and biologically active metabolites including antimicrobials. Nine endophytic fungi were isolated from the leaves and twigs of Premna serratifolia L. from a mangrove habitat in the Negombo lagoon and the antimicrobial activities of their laboratory cultures were evaluated. The most promising antimicrobial activity was exhibited by the endophytic fungus Hypocrea virens. Bioassay guided fractionation of the organic extract of this fungus led to the isolation of two known metabolites; the antimicrobial epidithiodioxopiperazine, gliotoxin (1), and the closely related but less active bisdethiobis(methylthio)gliotxin (2).

Previous studies showed that P. indica promotes early flowering and plant growth in the medicinal plant Coleus forskohlii. To determine the impact of P. indica on flowering time in Arabidopsis, we co-cultivated the plants with P. indica under long day condition. P. indica inoculated Arabidopsis plants displayed significant early flowering phenotype. qRT-PCR analysis of colonized plants revealed an up-regulation of flowering regulatory (FLOWERING LOCUST, LEAFY, and APETALA1) and gibberellin biosynthetic (Gibberellin 20-Oxidase2, Gibberellin 3-Oxidase1 and Gibberellin requiring) genes, while, the flowering-repressing gene FLOWERING LOCUS C was down regulated. Quantification of gibberellins content showed that the colonization with P. indica caused an increase in GA(4) content. Compared to wild-type plants, inoculation of the Arabidopsis ga5 mutant affected in gibberellin biosynthetic gene led to less pronounced changes in the expression of genes regulating flowering and to a lower increase in GA(4) content. Taken together, our data indicate that P. indica promotes early flowering in Arabidopsis likely by increasing gibberellin content. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

19329,Endophytic Fungi Isolated from Ageratina adenophora Exhibits Potential Antimicrobial Activity against Multidrug-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.,"Multidrug-resistant bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) cause infections that are difficult to treat globally, even with current available antibiotics. Therefore, there is an urgent need to search for novel antibiotics to tackle this problem. Endophytes are a potential source of novel bioactive compounds; however, the harnessing of novel pharmacological compounds from endophytes is infinite. Therefore, this study was designed to identify endophytic fungi (from Ageratina adenophora) with antibacterial activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria. Using fungal morphology and ITS-rDNA, endophytic fungi with antibacterial activities were isolated from A. adenophora. The results of the ITS rDNA sequence analysis showed that a total of 124 morphotype strains were identified. In addition, Species richness (S, 52), Margalef index (D/, 7.3337), Shannon-Wiener index (H/,3.6745), and Simpson's diversity index (D, 0.9304) showed that A. adenophora have abundant endophytic fungi resources. Furthermore, the results of the agar well diffusion showed that the Penicillium sclerotigenum, Diaporthe kochmanii, and Pestalotiopsis trachycarpicola endophytic fungi's ethyl acetate extracts showed moderate antibacterial and bactericidal activities, against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) SMU3194, with a MIC of 0.5-1 mg/mL and a MBC of 1-2 mg/mL.

18167,A Bacterial Endophyte from Apoplast Fluids Protects Canola Plants from Different Phytopathogens via Antibiosis and Induction of Host Resistance.,"Endophytic bacteria colonize inner plant tissues and thrive at the apoplast, which is considered its main reservoir. Because this niche is the place where the main molecular events take place between beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms, the aim of this work was to characterize culturable endophytic bacteria from apoplastic fluids obtained from field-grown canola leaves and analyze their potential for biological control of diseases caused by Xanthomonas campestris, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and Leptosphaeria maculans. Dual-culture analysis indicated that three isolates (Apo8, Apo11, and Apo12) were able to inhibit the growth of all three phytopathogens. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA and rpoD genes of these isolates revealed that they are closely related to Pseudomonas viridiflava. One of the isolates, Apo11, was able to diminish the propagation of X. campestris in whole-plant assays. At the same time, Apo11 inoculation reduced the necrotic lesions provoked by S. sclerotiorum on canola leaves. This protective effect might be due to the induction of resistance in the host mediated by salicylic and jasmonic acid signaling pathways or the production of compounds with antimicrobial activity. At the same time, Apo11 inoculation promoted canola plant growth. Thus, the isolate characterized in this work has several desirable characteristics, which make it a potential candidate for the formulation of biotechnological products to control plant diseases or promote plant growth.",Romero FM; Rossi FR; Gárriz A; Carrasco P; Ruíz OA,Phytopathology,2019,10.1094/PHYTO-07-18-0262-R,0.686684302585621,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.918713228578188,0.0812867714218119,0.999963305353666,3.66946463342677e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
12434,"Molecular typing of environmental Cryptococcus neoformans/C-gattii species complex isolates from Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil","Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are the main causative agents of cryptococcosis, a systemic fungal disease that affects internal organs and skin, and which is acquired by inhalation of spores or encapsulated yeasts. It is currently known that the C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex has a worldwide distribution, however, some molecular types seem to prevail in certain regions. Few environmental studies of Cryptococcus have been conducted in the Brazilian Amazon. This is the first ecological study of the pathogenic fungi C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex in the urban area of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. A total of 506 samples from pigeon droppings (n = 191), captive bird droppings (n = 60) and tree hollows (n = 255) were collected from June 2012 to January 2014 at schools and public buildings, squares, pet shops, households, the zoo and the bus station. Samples were plated on niger seed agar (NSA) medium supplemented with chloramphenicol and incubated at 25 degrees C for 5 days. Dark-brown colonies were isolated and tested for thermotolerance at 37 degrees C, cycloheximide resistance and growth on canavanine-glycine-bromothymol blue agar. Molecular typing was done by PCR-RFLP. Susceptibility to the antifungal drugs amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole and ketoconazole was tested using Etest((R)) strips. In total, 13 positive samples were obtained: one tree hollow (C. gattiiVGII), nine pigeon droppings (C. neoformansVNI) and three captive bird droppings (C. neoformansVNI). The environmental cryptococcal isolates found in this study were of the same molecular types as those responsible for infections in Manaus.","Alves, GSB; Freire, AKL; Bentes, AD; Pinheiro, JFD; de Souza, JVB; Wanke, B; Matsuura, T; Jackisch-Matsuura, AB",MYCOSES,2016,10.1111/myc.12499,0.978612064337083,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Absence,0.262481599661957,0.737518400338043,0.998951456994744,0.00104854300525559,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
16434,Effects of endophytic fungi (Paecilomyces sp.) on the salt tolerance of Salix integra; [拟青霉属内生真菌对杞柳耐盐性的影响],"The rehabilitation and reclamation of coastal saline- alkali land is of great significance since it is regarded as a reserve resource for cultivated land. Biological soil amelioration is an effective means of improving soil quality in saline- alkali land and focuses on improving the adaptability of plants to saline environments. In this study, an endophytic fungus (Paecilomyces sp.) isolated from the roots of a coastal plant was inoculated into the roots of Salix integra seedlings. The potential of this strain to promote plant growth under salt stress was explored, and the relevant mechanisms are discussed. The effects of inoculation with Paecilomyces sp. on the growth, physiology, and photosynthetic indices of Salix integra under salt stress were compared. Gene expression differences in the leaves of Salix integra before and after inoculation with Paecilomyces sp. were analyzed. Compared with the control group without inoculation, root length, root surface area, and root volume of Salix integra in the treatment group (inoculated with Paecilomyces sp.) were significantly increased by 163.4%, 72.4% and 96.4%, respectively; the catalase (CAT) activity, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) concentration, and core chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (photosystem Ⅱ actual photochemical quantum efficiency (ΦPSⅡ), photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), and electron transportation rate (ETR)) in leaves were significantly enhanced (P < 0.05). Under salt stress, 701 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the leaves of Salix integra before and after endophytic fungus inoculation, according to transcriptome data. They were mainly enriched in phenylpropane biosynthesis, plant-pathogen interactions, plant hormone signal transduction, starch/sucrose metabolism, and other pathways. Among the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathways, the upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in plant hormone signaling pathways. Gene function analysis indicated that genes annotated in the jasmonic acid-, ethylene-, auxin-, and cytokinin signaling and brassinol biosynthesis pathways play an important role in the regulation of salinity tolerance by Paecilomyces sp. In summary, this endophytic fungus strain (Paecilomyces sp.) can effectively alleviate the adverse effects of salt stress on the growth and photosynthesis of Salix integra seedlings. © 2024 Science Press.

229,Community analysis of Persian oak fungal microbiome under dust storm conditions,"Dust storms have major effects on terrestrial ecosystems through the long-distance transport and deposition of particulate matter. It is unclear how dust deposition affects plant-associated microbiomes in downwind ecosystems. Here we show that dust deposition may negatively influence the isolation, richness, and diversity of endophytic fungal communities of Persian oak. We used culture-based methods paired with Sanger sequencing to examine these effects on fungal assemblages isolated from leaf, branch and deposited dust. Increased amounts of dust deposition led to decreased endophytic fungal diversity in plant tissues but increased fungal diversity in deposited dust layers on leaves. Dust deposition decreased the abundance of a dominant endophyte in branches with promising biocontrol properties. Endophytic fungal communities found in leaves were more similar to fungal assemblages of deposited dust in comparison to branch endophytes. Our results suggest that dust storms may have ecosystem-wide effects by altering the fungal microbiomes of forest-forming trees. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

Various factors for inoculation of detached pods were studied using several Brassica rapa genotypes to identify resistance in the pod setting stage of B. rapa cultivars. Optimal conditions for pod inoculation were (1) inoculum concentration of 5 x 10(3) conidia/ml, (2) incubation temperature of 20-25 degrees C, and (3) a 48-h waiting period post inoculation using 25-day-old pods. A pod screening test using 43 cultivars of B. rapa effectively distinguished various levels of resistance between cultivars. As a result, we identified cultivars viz 'Yajima kabu', 'Saishin' and 'Shimofusa kabu' as resistant. The resistant B. rapa cultivars are useful not only for B. rapa breeding, but also for breeding programs for other Brassica species, such as B. napus, which is derived from B. rapa and B. oleracea and has little genetic variation due to the limited size of the descendent population.","Doullah, MAU; Meah, MB; Mohsin, GM; Hassan, A; Ikeda, T; Hori, H; Okazaki, K",SABRAO JOURNAL OF BREEDING AND GENETICS,2009,NA,0.974873193471161,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991469526857994,0.00853047314200624,0.999999725639295,2.7436070459963e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2456,Nitrogen addition and fungal symbiosis alter early dune plant succession,"Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) enrichment can have complex effects on plant communities. In low-nutrient, primary successional systems such as sand dunes, N enrichment may alter the trajectory of plant community assembly or the dominance of foundational, ecosystem-engineering plants. Predicting the consequences of N enrichment may be complicated by plant interactions with microbial symbionts because increases in a limiting resource, such as N, could alter the costs and benefits of symbiosis. To evaluate the direct and interactive effects of microbial symbiosis and N addition on plant succession, we established a long-term field experiment in Michigan, USA, manipulating the presence of the symbiotic fungal endophyte Epichloe amarillans in Ammophila breviligulata, a dominant ecosystem-engineering dune grass species. From 2016 to 2020, we implemented N fertilization treatments (control, low, high) in a subset of the long-term experiment. N addition suppressed the accumulation of plant diversity over time mainly by reducing species richness of colonizing plants. However, this suppression occurred only when the endophyte was present in Ammophila. Although Epichloe enhanced Ammophila tiller density over time, N addition did not strongly interact with Epichloe symbiosis to influence vegetative growth of Ammophila. Instead, N addition directly altered plant community composition by increasing the abundance of efficient colonizers, especially C-4 grasses. In conclusion, hidden microbial symbionts can alter the consequences of N enrichment on plant primary succession.","Garces, KR; Bell-Dereske, L; Rudgers, JA; Emery, SM",OECOLOGIA,2023,10.1007/s00442-023-05362-5,0.971492973718655,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999747139178504,2.5286082149565e-4,0.999999999999897,1.02806652080289e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

7321,Differences in endophytic bacterial and fungal compositions in roots between red and green Amaranthus sp.,"The compositions of endophytic bacteria and fungi in the roots of red and green Amaranthus sp. were analyzed to elucidate whether endophytic microbes are related to the formation of its pigment. The results showed that the compositions of the dominant endophytic bacteria and fungi significantly differed between red and green amaranths. Bordetella, Massilia, Ralstonia, norank_f__67-14, and Acidibacter were unique dominant endophytic bacterial genera in the roots of red amaranth cultivars, and Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, norank_f__Moraxellaceae, and unclassified_f__Rhodocyclaceae were the unique dominant endophytic bacterial genera in the roots of green amaranth cultivars. Cladosporium and unclassified_o__Agaricales were the unique dominant endophytic fungal genera in the roots of red amaranth, and Neocosmospora, Trichocladium, Cladophialophora, and Setophoma were the unique dominant endophytic fungal genera in the roots of green amaranth. Although common dominant endophytic bacteria and fungi were found in the roots of both cultivars, their proportions were different. For example, the abundance of Basidomycota was significantly higher in roots of red amaranth than in the roots of green amaranth. PICRUSt functional analysis showed that root bacterial communities in red and green amaranths differed in metabolic capacity, including metabolism, genetic and environmental information processing, cellular processes, human diseases, and organic systems. Furthermore, fungal function prediction analysis indicated that the endophytic fungi were mainly saprotrophic.

15010,Promising Cytotoxic butenolides from the Soybean endophytic fungus Aspergillus terreus: a combined molecular docking and in-vitro studies,"Aim: This study aimed to use one strain many compounds approach (OSMAC) to investigate the cytotoxic potential of Aspergillus terreus associated with soybean versus several cancer cell lines, by means of in-silico and in vitro approaches. Methods and results: Fermentation of the isolated strain was done on five media. The derived extracts were investigated for their inhibitory activities against three human cancer cell lines; mammary gland breast cancer (MCF-7), colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) using MTT Assay. The fungal mycelia fermented in Modified Potato Dextrose Broth (MPDB) was the most cytotoxic extract against HepG2, MCF-7, and Caco-2 cell lines with IC50 4.2 ± 0.13, 5.9 ± 0.013 and 7.3 ± 0.004 μg mL−1, respectively. MPDB extract was scaled up resulting in the isolation of six metabolites; three fatty acids (1, 2, and 4), one sterol (3) and two butenolides (5 and 6) by column chromatography. The isolated compounds (1–6) were screened through a molecular docking approach for their binding aptitude to various active sites. butyrolactone-I (5) revealed a significant interaction within the CDK2 active site, while aspulvinone E (6) showed promising binding affinity to FLT3 and EGFR active sites that was confirmed by in vitro CDK2, FLT3 and EGFR inhibitory activity. Finally, the in vitro cytotoxic activities of butyrolactone-I (5) and aspulvinone E (6) revealed the antiproliferative activity of butyrolactone-I (5), against HepG2 cell line (IC50 = 17.85 ± 0.32 μM). Conclusion: Molecular docking analysis and in vitro assays suggested the CDK2/A2 inhibitory potential of butyrolactone-I (5) in addition to the promising interaction abilities of aspulvinone E (6) with EGFR and FLT3 active sites as a possible mechanism of their biological activities. © The Author(s) 2023.

11733,"Interaction between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophytes in the root systems of Populus euphratica and Haloxylon ammodendron under different drought conditions in Xinjiang, China","Background and Aims Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) are known to enhance the tolerance of host plants to biotic and abiotic stresses, but the mechanism of their interaction under natural conditions has not been extensively studied.Methods We analyzed the endophytic fungal diversity and colonization characteristics in the typical desert plants Populus euphratica and Haloxylon ammodendron and the relationship between them and environmental factors.Results Except for DSE in the roots of H. ammodendron, the colonization rates of AMF and DSE were significantly positively correlated with drought severity. The abundance of AMF and DSE under medium and mild drought conditions was greater than that under severe drought conditions. The root colonization rate and abundance of AMF were lower than those of DSE under the same drought conditions. The species diversity and abundance of AMF and DSE in P. euphratica were greater than those in H. ammodendron. AMF were more susceptible to soil factors such as soil water content, soil nitrogen and phosphorus content, and urease, whereas DSE were more affected by pH.Conclusion Drought stress has different effects on AMF and DSE in the roots of P. euphratica and H. ammodendron. DSE have a greater advantage in extremely arid environments. This study demonstrates the interaction between AMF and DSE with the host plants P. euphratica and H. ammodendron as well as their effects on the adaptation of host plants to the desert environment, which can provide a basis for strengthening desert vegetation management.","Wang, HM; Wang, HF; Wei, ST; Sun, L; Cheng, LL",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2025,10.3389/fpls.2024.1504650,0.984732491723392,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99509402952056,0.0049059704794397,0.999999994787624,5.212376197327731e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

We assessed the diversity of root associated fungi of Rhododendron decorum using internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis, and our aim was to evaluate the role of different factors in structuring ericoid mycorrhizal (ERM) and non-ericoid mycorrhizal (NEM) fungal communities. Thirty-five fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were found in roots of R. decorum, of which 25 were putative ERM fungal species. Of the two main groups of known ERM, helotialean fungi were more abundant and common than sebacinalean species. Geographic and host patterning of the fungal assemblages were different for ERM and NEM. The distribution of putative ERM fungal terminal restriction fragments (TRFs) showed that there were more common species within ERM than in the NEM fungal assemblages. Results of Mantel tests indicated that the composition of NEM fungal assemblages correlated with geographic parameters while ERM fungal assemblages lacked a significant geographic pattern and instead were correlated with host genotype. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that the NEM fungal assemblages were significantly correlated with latitude, longitude, elevation, mean annual precipitation (MAP), and axis 2 of a host-genetic principle component analysis (PCA), while ERM fungal assemblages correlated only with latitude and axis 1 of the host-genetic PCA. We conclude that ERM and NEM assemblages are affected by different factors, with the host genetic composition more important for ERM and geographic factors more important for NEM assemblages. Our results contribute to understanding the roles of dispersal limitation, abiotic factors and biotic interactions in structuring fungal communities in plant roots.","Sun, LF; Pei, KQ; Wang, F; Ding, Q; Bing, YH; Gao, B; Zheng, Y; Liang, Y; Ma, KP",PLOS ONE,2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0049867,0.890934713517609,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.9519208442981,0.0480791557019004,0.999984730254365,1.52697456351492e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
4451,"OCCURRENCE AND IMPORTANCE OF MYCORRHIZAE IN AQUATIC TREES OF NEW-SOUTH-WALES, AUSTRALIA","Vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) infection was found in KOH-cleared and lactophenol-blue-stained roots of Salix babylonica, Melaleuca quinquenervia and Casuarina cunninghamiana. These are all trees growing on creeks and river banks, in stationary or slowly flowing fresh or brackish waters in swamps, creeks, drains and channels, and in seepage areas of New South Wales, Australia. Larger and older roots lacked VAM infection in the inner cortex, probably due to suberisation of cells, and the endophyte was restricted to the epidermal layers. Spores and sporocarps of the VAM fungi Glomus fasciculatus, G. mosseae, Sclerocystis rubiformis, Gigaspora margarita and an unidentified Scutellospora sp. were wet sieved and decanted from aquatic sediments and soils. The presence of similar VAM fungal spores in the aquatic sediments and terrestrial soil suggests that they probably enter the aquatic sediments through run off from the land ecosystem. All three plants formed vesicular arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizae almost exclusively in the marshy, periodically inundated soils, but the same plant species formed endo-/ectomycorrhizae when growing in soil with higher redox potentials (E(h)). Salix and Melaleuca tree roots possessed both VAmycorrhizae and ectomycorrhizae. VAM roots of Casuarina were equipped with both N-fixing Frankia nodules and proteoid roots. VAM endophytes did not invade nodular cortical tissues, suggesting the presence of an exclusion mechanism which needs further study. The highest VAM infection was found in nodulated specimens. Free-floating roots growing in water close to the banks were non-mycorrhizal but were mycorrhizal in the bottom-rooting state. VAM spore number and mycorrhizal infection seem to be associated with redox-potential, i.e. lower at sites such as swamps, water or sediments with lower E(h) values than in terrestrial soils with higher E(h) values. A relationship between soil moisture gradient and VAM infection pattern became apparent from the study of a C. cunninghamiana transect on a creek embankment, i.e. typical vesicles and arbuscules were found in roots from drier soils, there was a lack of arbuscules in relatively wet soils but large lipid-filled intracellular vesicles were present, and typical vesicles and arbuscules were absent in flooded creek beds where roots were associated with coenocytic intercellular hyphae with abundant lipid droplets. The importance of VA mycorrhiza, ectomycorrhizae, N-fixing root nodules and proteoid roots at the land-water interface is discussed with reference to the use of these trees as pioneering species for stabilising river and stream banks, reducing erosion, windbreaking, and as a long-term and inexpensive means of achieving biological control of aquatic weeds by shading waterways.","KHAN, AG",MYCORRHIZA,1993,10.1007/BF00213465,0.544289687847834,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997964070848241,0.00203592915175861,0.999999999765067,2.3493340606251004e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
10968,Penicillium polonicum-mediated green synthesis of silver nanoparticles: Unveiling antimicrobial and seed germination advancements,"Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), widely recognized for their nanoscale geometric size and unique properties, such as large specific surface area, high permeability, and high safety, were synthesized using the endophytic fungus Penicillium polonicum PG21 through a green approach. Four key synthesis factors-48 h, 45 degrees C, pH 9.0, and 80 mM AgNPs concentration-were optimized. Characterization via ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fouriertransform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction revealed the AgNPs as approximately 3-25 nm spherical particles with numerous functional groups ensuring stability. AgNPs were tested against various fungal and bacterial plant pathogens, including Botrytis cinerea (EB-1), Alternaria alternata (EB-2, EB-3), Fusarium solani (RG-1), Williamsia serinedens (SL-1), Sphingopyxis macrogoltabida (SL-2), Bacillus velezensis (SL-3), and Pseudomonas mediterranea (SL-4), causing agricultural challenges. PG21-synthesized AgNPs exhibited inhibition rates against all tested fungi, with 60 mu g/mL AgNPs demonstrating optimal inhibition rates. Notably, EB-1 experienced a significant growth inhibition, reaching an inhibition rate reached of 74.22 +/- 1.54%. Conversely, RG-1 exhibited the smallest inhibitory effect at 48.13 +/- 0.92%. The effect of AgNPs on safflower seed germination and growth revealed notable increases in shoot length, fresh weight, stem length, and number of lateral roots-1.4, 1.4, 1.33, and 10.67 times higher than the control, respectively, at an AgNPs concentration of 80 mu g/mL. In conclusion, green-synthesized AgNPs demonstrate pathogen toxicity, showcasing potential applications in disease management for industrial crops and promoting plant growth.","Zhu, YH; Hu, XX; Qiao, MY; Zhao, L; Dong, CM",HELIYON,2024,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e28971,0.976750374922722,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.986281163420116,0.0137188365798841,0.999999983695697,1.63043027967547e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was used for accurate and sensitive detection of C. capsici. Sequences of β-tubulin gene of C. capsici were used as target template to design LAMP primers. The primers were very specific to C capsici and did not react against any other seed-borne fungi of chillies. LAMP assay was sensitive and could detect as little as 10 fg μ,1-1 of C capsici pathogen in comparison with 1 ng μl-1 of C capsici detection using polymerase chain reaction. Further test detection of infected chilli seeds collected from different locations in India showed that the LAMP assay was more sensitive than the PCR-based detection of C capsici. This LAMP assay is simple, fast and sensitive in detection of C. capsici infected field samples, tissue culture materials and for schedule screening of plant quarantine materials under exchange. In the present study, LAMP assay has been used for fast and sensitive detection of C. capsici pathogen. © Triveni Enterprises, Lucknow (India).",Kandan A.; Akhtar J.; Singh B.; Pal D.; Chand D.; Agarwal P.C.; Dubey S.C.,Journal of Environmental Biology,2016,NA,0.815314913568884,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Absence,0.235704647630931,0.764295352369069,0.999992077868852,7.92213114764184e-6,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
15343,CHANGES IN ANTIOXIDANT ENZYMES OF BARLEY (Hordeum vulgare L.) USING THE ENDOPHYTIC FUNGUS PIRIFORMOSPORA INDICA AND THE BACTERIUM AZOSPIRILLUM SPP. UNDER DROUGHT STRESS,"SUMMARY Piriformospora indica and Azospirillum spp. due to great ability to effectively improve plant growth and stress tolerance, have been considered significantly in recent decades. The present study was conducted as factorial based on a randomized complete block with three replications in the research field of Plant Production Engineering and Genetics, Faculty of Agriculture, Maragheh University. The experimental treatments included three levels of stress (full irrigation, irrigation at 70% of field capacity, and irrigation at 50% of field capacity), endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica (non-use and use) and bacterium Azospirillum (non-use and use). The results of the present study showed that the interaction between drought stress and using fungi and bacteria had a significant effect at the probability level of 1% on leaf area, chlorophyll a, the activity of glutathione reductase, ascorbate peroxidase, and catalase; and the content of malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, superoxide dismutase, Fe-SOD isozymes, Mn-SOD, and proline at the probability level of 5% on Cu/Zn-SOD isozyme. The simple effects of the studied treatments were also significant on the parameters of chlorophyll b and carotenoids at the statistical level of 1%. The highest content of superoxide dismutase, Cu/Zn-SOD, Fe-SOD, Mn-SOD isozymes, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase peroxidase and glutathione reductase was obtained from inoculation with bacteria and fungi in irrigation treatment at 50% of field capacity resulting in a reduction by 47.01 and 33.93% in the content of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde in irrigation treatment at 50% of field capacity and the combined use of fungi and bacteria compared to the non-use of fungi and bacteria in the same treatment. So, it can be concluded that the combined use of Piriformospora indica and Azospirillum spp. under conditions of severe drought stress can play an important role in modulating Barley growth. © 2022, University of Montenegro.

18620,How Phytohormones Shape Interactions between Plants and the Soil-Borne Fungus Fusarium oxysporum.,"Plants interact with a huge variety of soil microbes, ranging from pathogenic to mutualistic. The Fusarium oxysporum (Fo) species complex consists of ubiquitous soil inhabiting fungi that can infect and cause disease in over 120 different plant species including tomato, banana, cotton, and Arabidopsis. However, in many cases Fo colonization remains symptomless or even has beneficial effects on plant growth and/or stress tolerance. Also in pathogenic interactions a lengthy asymptomatic phase usually precedes disease development. All this indicates a sophisticated and fine-tuned interaction between Fo and its host. The molecular mechanisms underlying this balance are poorly understood. Plant hormone signaling networks emerge as key regulators of plant-microbe interactions in general. In this review we summarize the effects of the major phytohormones on the interaction between Fo and its diverse hosts. Generally, Salicylic Acid (SA) signaling reduces plant susceptibility, whereas Jasmonic Acid (JA), Ethylene (ET), Abscisic Acid (ABA), and auxin have complex effects, and are potentially hijacked by Fo for host manipulation. Finally, we discuss how plant hormones and Fo effectors balance the interaction from beneficial to pathogenic and vice versa.",Di X; Takken FL; Tintor N,Frontiers in plant science,2016,10.3389/fpls.2016.00170,0.972483599472736,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999288460581526,7.1153941847359e-4,0.999996828252855,3.17174714536961e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11856,Reverse chemical ecology to study the defense of the plant host Sextonia rubra and the chemical mediators of its endophyte Fusarium falciforme against phytopathogen Trametes versicolor,"Sextonia rubra is a tropical tree endemic to the Guiana Shield and the Brazilian Amazon. Despite its renowned wood durability, it remains susceptible to degradation by white-rot fungi such as Trametes versicolor. To mitigate biotic stresses, plants can rely on their associated microbial communities, including endophytes, which play a crucial role in their defense mechanisms. In this study, we explored the cultivable microbiota of S. rubra, considering it a holobiont. Endophytic strains were isolated from the bark, sapwood and heartwood of S. rubra, and metabolome were extracted. We used a reverse chemical ecology approach to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these extracts' fungicidal activity. In this context, glutathione-S-transferases (GST), key detoxification enzymes of the lignivorous fungus T. versicolor, were chosen as targets. GST tests confirmed the presence of antifungal compounds in extracts from 13 of the 152 endophytes. Two isolates of Fusarium falciforme and one isolate of Fusarium graminearum were selected for co-culture experiments with T. versicolor. A comprehensive metabolic analysis of the confrontation zones using RPLC-ESI(+)-HRMS/MS and molecular networking revealed that the antifungal activity against T. versicolor was primarily mediated by cyclopeptides, and the observed contact inhibition was attributed to fusarins. These findings shed new light on the role of endophytic fungi in the chemical defense strategies of S. rubra, highlighting their potential as a source of bioactive compounds with antifungal properties.","Levasseur, M; Trac, A; Clavereau, I; Zannini, F; Estevez, Y; Amusant, N; Gelhaye, É; Pollet, N; Houël, E; Touboul, D; Eparvier, V",PHYTOCHEMISTRY,2025,10.1016/j.phytochem.2025.114577,0.945291922152433,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999198936011225,8.0106398877498e-4,0.999999995730148,4.2698524715945e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10537,The locoweed endophyte Alternaria oxytropis affects root development in Arabidopsis in vitro through auxin signaling and polar transport,"Locoweeds are leguminous forbs known for their toxicity to livestock caused by the endophytic fungi Alternaria sect. Undifilum. Unlike the defensive mutualisms reported in many toxin-producing endophytes and their plant hosts, the benefits that A. sect. Undifilum can confer to it host plants remains unclear. Here, we conducted physiological and genetic analyses to show that A. (sect. Undifilum) oxytropis influences growth, especially root development, in its locoweed host Oxytropis ochrocephala and Arabidopsis. The presence of A. oxytropis significantly decreased primary root length while increasing the numbers of lateral roots and root hairs, and increasing plant leaf area and fresh weight. The fungus also increased the concentrations of plant endogenous auxin, and the expression of key genes for auxin biosynthesis, signaling, and transport. These effects on root development were abolished in mutants deficient in auxin signaling and polar transport. Alternaria oxytropis down-regulated expression of PIN1 but increased expression of PIN2, PIN7, and AUX1, which might reflect alterations in the spatial accumulation of auxin responsible for the changes in root architecture. Plant growth was insensitive to A. oxytropis when naphthylphthalamic acid was applied. Our findings indicate a function of A. oxytropis in promoting the growth and development of Arabidopsis via the regulation of auxin, which in turn suggests a possible role in benefiting its locoweed hosts via a process independent of its toxin production.","Guan, HR; Liu, X; Fu, YP; Han, XM; Wang, YL; Li, Q; Guo, L; Mur, LAJ; Wei, YH; He, W",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,2023,10.1093/jxb/erac430,0.738904408364027,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.938814407905869,0.0611855920941306,0.999905078038913,9.49219610869578e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

A pot experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of these PGPB on plant growth and Cd accumulation of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) plants grown on aged Cd-spiked soil. The results showed that the four PGPB significantly boosted oilseed rape shoot biomass production, improved soil and plant analyzer development (SPAD) value, enhanced Cd uptake of plant and Cd translocation to the leaves. By fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and green fluorescent protein (GFP), we demonstrated the studied S. alfredii endophytic bacterium SaMR12 were able to colonize successfully in the B. napus roots. However, all four PGPB could increase seed Cd accumulation.

9979,Differences in host-pathogen response and tolerance to esca disease between 'Pardina' and 'Tempranillo' grapevine cultivars,"Grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs) represent a major phytopathogenic problem in viticulture worldwide. The Ascomycota Phaeomoniella chlamydospora is one of the most abundant fungal species associated with GTDs such as esca proper, grapevine leaf stripe disease (GLSD) and Petri disease. Currently, no efficient curative chemical treatments are available for their control. Additionally, various levels of susceptibility and mortality have been identified among grapevine cultivars in vineyards. It is believed that planting disease-tolerant cultivars would be one of the sustainable strategies for GTD management. The visual inspection of the foliar symptoms in established vineyards over 4 years (2018-2021) suggested that the 'Pardina' cultivar was more tolerant than the 'Tempranillo' cultivar to esca foliar symptom expression. Controlled inoculation with P. chlamydospora in greenhouse conditions contributed to better understand the differences between both cultivars in (i) foliar gene expression responses, (ii) vegetative symptom emergence, and (iii) internal fungal development and lesion in the wood.

9695,An endophyte-rich diet increases ant predation on a specialist herbivorous insect,"1. All plants form symbioses with microfungi, known as endophytes, which live within plant tissues. Numerous studies have documented endophyte-herbivore antagonism in grass systems, but plant-endophyte-insect interactions are highly variable for forbs and woody plants. 2. The net effect of endophytes on insect herbivory may be modified by their interactions with higher trophic levels, such as predators. Including these multitrophic dynamics may explain some of the variability among endophyte studies of non-grass plants, which are currently based exclusively on bitrophic studies. 3. The abundance of natural foliar endophytes in a Neotropical vine was manipulated and beetles were fed high or low endophyte diets. Experimental assays assessed whether dietary endophyte load affected beetle growth, leaf consumption, and susceptibility to ant predation. 4. Beetles feeding on high- versus low-endophyte plants had almost identical growth and leaf consumption rates. 5. In a field bioassay, however, it was discovered that feeding on an endophyte-rich diet increased a beetle's odds of capture by predatory ants nine-fold. 6. Endophytes could thus provide an indirect, enemy-mediated form of plant defence that operates even against specialist herbivores. We argue that a multitrophic approach is necessary to untangle the potentially diverse types of endophyte defence among plants.","Hammer, TJ; Van Bael, SA",ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY,2015,10.1111/een.12186,0.643718338307355,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.95644162136635,0.0435583786336503,0.999999980705734,1.92942655186101e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
15342,"Bioactive Compounds Characterization and Antimicrobial Potentials of Crude Extract of Curvularia lunata, a Fungal Endophyte from Elaeis guineensis.","Bioactive compounds of microbial origin remain the frontline for novel drug discovery and development in the pharmaceutical industry. Endophytic fungi are gaining much attention as reservoirs of bioactive compounds with beneficial therapeutic activities. The present study is focused on evaluating the chemical compositions and antimicrobial activity of secondary metabolites produced by Curvularia lunata, an endophytic fungus of Elaeis guineensis. The endophytic fungus was isolated from healthy leaves of E. guineensis using standard methods and identified using internal transcribed spacer (ITS-rDNA) sequence analysis. The fungus was subjected to solid-state fermentation and secondary metabolites extracted using ethyl acetate and concentrated under a vacuum. The crude extracts were screened for antimicrobial activity against selected pathogenic bacteria and Candida albicans using the agar diffusion method. The bioactive components of the fungal extracts were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Crude extract of C. lunata at 1mg/mL displayed potent antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans, with inhibition zones of 8 ± 0.6 mm, 2 ± 1.0 mm, and 10 ± 1.5 mm respectively. GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of compounds, such as 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, γ-terpinene, heptadecane, 2,6,10,14-tetramethyl, tetradecanoic acid, 2-hydroxy-, methyl ester, p-cymene, oxirane (chloromethyl) among others in the fungal extracts. These compounds are known to possess several beneficial biological properties. Hence from the results of this study, the endophytic fungus C. lunata, isolated from E. guineensis produce interesting bioactive compounds that can be explored in the development of effective antimicrobials and other pharmaceutical agents. © 2022 the authors.",Nwobodo D.C.; Eze P.M.; Okezie U.M.; Okafoanyali J.O.; Okoye F.B.C.; Esimone C.O.,Tropical Journal of Natural Product Research,2022,10.26538/tjnpr/v6i3.16,0.569237124618417,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998819529769137,0.00118047023086338,0.999999998202132,1.7978679656138801e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
889,"Characterization of a novel, ubiquitous fungal endophyte from the rhizosphere and root endosphere of Populus trees","We examined variation in growth rate, patterns of nitrogen utilization, and competitive interactions of Atractiella rhizophila isolates from the roots of Populus hosts. Atractiella grew significantly faster on media substituted with inorganic nitrogen sources and slower in the presence of another fungal genus. To determine plausible causal mechanisms we used metabolomics to explore competitive interactions between Atractiella strains and Fusarium oxysporum or Leptosphaerulina chartarum. Metabolomic screening of potential microbial inhibitors showed increased levels of glycosides produced in vitro by Atractiella when grown with a different fungal genus, relative to when grown alone. Cumulatively, these results suggest Atractiella is a poor competitor with other fungi via direct routes e.g. faster growth rates, but may utilize chemical interactions and possibly nitrogen sources to defend itself, and niche partition its way to abundance in the plant host root and rhizosphere.

7159,"Combining an OSMAC approach and untargeted metabolomics to profile compounds exhibiting anti-HIV-1 activities in an endophytic fungus, Penicillium Rubens P03MB2","The persistent burden of HIV-1 in Sub-Saharan Africa underscores the need for innovative treatments, as current antiretroviral therapies cannot eliminate latent proviral reservoirs and face challenges from multidrug-resistant strains. This study investigates the potential of Penicillium rubens P03MB2, an endophytic fungus from the Albizia adianthifolia plant, as a source of novel anti-HIV-1 compounds. The fungus was cultivated in various media (malt extract broth, oats, and rice), with oat media yielding crude extracts exhibiting significant anti-HIV-1 activity. Active fractions were further analyzed using an untargeted metabolomics and molecular networking approach, revealing clusters of secondary metabolites, including coumarins and other anti-HIV-1-associated compounds. A virtual screening workflow was employed to assess the binding affinities of these metabolites against HIV-1 protease. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations were used to analyze ligand-protein complex stability. Binding free energy calculations highlighted diosgenin as a promising candidate, with a binding free energy of -34.59 kcal/mol, outperforming the co-crystallized ligand ORV. This research demonstrates the potential of secondary metabolites from Penicillium rubens as novel anti-HIV-1 agents, offering a foundation for further developing effective antiviral therapies.","Moloi, N; Khumalo, MC; Nxumalo, WP; Mtambo, SE; Mkhwanazi, NP; Ndlovu, SI",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2025,10.1038/s41598-025-08091-2,0.942913273000471,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997161629933923,0.00283837006607727,0.999980979021731,1.90209782690021e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3837,Diversity and biological activity of culturable endophytic bacteria associated with marigold (Calendula officinalis L.),"Endophytes colonizing plant tissue play an essential role in plant growth, development, stress tolerance and plant protection from soil-borne diseases. In this study, we report the diversity of cultivable endophytic bacteria associated with marigold (Calendula officinalis L.) by using 16S rRNA gene analysis and their plant beneficial properties. A total of 42 bacterial isolates were obtained from plant tissues of marigold. They belonged to the genera Pantoea, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Achromobacter, Xanthomonas, Rathayibacter, Agrobacterium, Pseudoxanthomonas, and Beijerinckia. Among the bacterial strains, P. kilonensis FRT12, and P. rhizosphaerae FST5 showed moderate or vigorous inhibition against three tested plant pathogenic fungi, F. culmorum, F. solani and R. solani. They also demonstrated the capability to produce hydrolytic enzymes and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Five out of 16 isolates significantly stimulated shoot and root growth of marigold in a pot experiment. The present study reveals that more than half of the bacterial isolates associated with marigold (C. officinalis L.) provided antifungal activity against one or more plant pathogenic fungi. Our findings suggest that medicinal plants with antimicrobial activity could be a source for selecting microbes with antagonistic activity against fungal plant pathogens or with plant growth stimulating potential. These isolates might be considered as promising candidates for the improvement of plant health.","Shurigin, V; Alaylar, B; Davranov, K; Wirth, S; Bellingrath-Kimura, SD; Egamberdieva, D",AIMS MICROBIOLOGY,2021,10.3934/microbiol.2021021,0.978809500535982,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.980114654822594,0.0198853451774064,0.999998161069786,1.8389302141042e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1112,Plant Host Traits Mediated by Foliar Fungal Symbionts and Secondary Metabolites,"Fungal symbionts living inside plant leaves (""endophytes"") can vary from beneficial to parasitic, but the mechanisms by which the fungi affect the plant host phenotype remain poorly understood. Chemical interactions are likely the proximal mechanism of interaction between foliar endophytes and the plant, as individual fungal strains are often exploited for their diverse secondary metabolite production. Here, we go beyond single strains to examine commonalities in how 16 fungal endophytes shift plant phenotypic traits such as growth and physiology, and how those relate to plant metabolomics profiles. We inoculated individual fungi on switchgrass, Panicum virgatum L. This created a limited range of plant growth and physiology (2-370% of fungus-free controls on average), but effects of most fungi overlapped, indicating functional similarities in unstressed conditions. Overall plant metabolomics profiles included almost 2000 metabolites, which were broadly correlated with plant traits across all the fungal treatments. Terpenoid-rich samples were associated with larger, more physiologically active plants and phenolic-rich samples were associated with smaller, less active plants. Only 47 metabolites were enriched in plants inoculated with fungi relative to fungus-free controls, and of these, Lasso regression identified 12 metabolites that explained from 14 to 43% of plant trait variation. Fungal long-chain fatty acids and sterol precursors were positively associated with plant photosynthesis, conductance, and shoot biomass, but negatively associated with survival. The phytohormone gibberellin, in contrast, was negatively associated with plant physiology and biomass. These results can inform ongoing efforts to develop metabolites as crop management tools, either by direct application or via breeding, by identifying how associations with more beneficial components of the microbiome may be affected.","Sandy, M; Bui, TI; Aba, KS; Ruiz, N; Paszalek, J; Connor, EW; Hawkes, CV",MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,2023,10.1007/s00248-022-02057-x,0.994653355579784,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999667785067089,3.3221493291149e-4,0.999999998019066,1.98093408343425e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11284,Emmia lacerata SR5 Promotes Michelia macclurei Growth by Enhancing Nutrient Uptake and Regulating Morphology,"We observed the effects of Emmia lacerata strain SR-5 on the growth of two Michelia macclurei clones (clone-411 and clone-425) and analyzed their similarities and differences. Here, we evaluated the growth-promoting effect of E. lacerata on M. macclurei, a native tree species of subtropical China. Clonal plantlets of M. macclurei (clone-411 and clone-425) were inoculated with E. lacerata strain SR5, and the growth of the plantlets was recorded continuously for 6 months. The effects of strain SR5 on the two M. macclurei genotypes were evaluated by measuring physiological responses, nutrient uptake, and soil microbial community structure. Growth parameters and biomass of M. macclurei plantlets were significantly enhanced by SR5 inoculation. Scanning analysis of roots and leaves showed that their growth was promoted. Interestingly, the growth-promoting effect of SR5 was more significant on clone-411 than on clone-425. Based on the characteristics of both soil and plantlets, we speculated that the specific growth-promoting mechanisms of SR5 differed between the two M. macclurei clones. SR5 appeared to promote growth of clone-411 mainly by promoting nutrient absorption, whereas its effect on clone-425 may have been mediated through plant growth hormone production. Comparing the effects of strain SR5 on two clones provides insight into key factors in the process of strain-plant interaction and can promote the development of biofertilizer.","Pan, XY; Liang, JY; Zhang, JH; Liu, Y; Liang, JF; Song, J; Chen, YL",JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION,2022,10.1007/s42729-021-00707-6,0.968308429122539,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999771617093661,2.2838290633929e-4,0.999999992881643,7.1183570149457906e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19852,Isolation and identification of endophytic fungi from Tinospora cordifolia,"Endophytic fungi are the most promising reservoir of bioactive compounds with large chemical multiplicity. These effective bioactive agents have been optimized by nature through evolutionary, ecological and environmental factors. Endophytes were found to produce essential bioactive metabolites which were originally produced by their host plant. It raises the prospect of using these microbial endophytes as an alternative source of phytocompounds. In the present study endophytic fungal isolates were screened from leaf and stem tissue of Tinospora cordifolia (Willd) Miers [Synonym: T sinensis (Lour.) Merr] plant using Azadirachta indica tree as support during summer and winter season. The small segments of surface sterilized leaf and stem tissue were inoculated on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) medium incubated at 26 degrees C for 10 days and were checked regularly for the growth of endophytic fungal colonies. Pure isolates were obtained by picking individual fungal hyphal tips from the PDA plates and subcultured on fresh PDA plates subsequently for 10 days. A total no. of 36 different endophytic fungi were screened from leaf and stem portion of T cordifolia. These isolated species were identified via cultural characteristics and morphology of spores and fruiting structure using standard taxonomic manuals. Out of 36, 20 isolates (EF 1- EF 20) were isolated from leaf tissue and 16 isolates (EF 21- EF 36) were from stem part. The isolated fungal species were from different generas i.e. Alternaria, Curvularia, Cladosporium, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Colletotrichum, Rhizopus, Helminthosporium, Pleurothecium, Aureobasidium, Cercospora and among these Alternaria, Curvularia, Penicillium and Aspergillus were most abundant species in both (leaf and stem) tissues. The leaf tissue harbors more endophytic species as compared to its stem counterpart.","Priti; Sulekha, R",RESEARCH JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY,2021,NA,0.923484458689807,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Absence,0.203889783103017,0.796110216896983,0.999822175485015,1.7782451498549e-4,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

We analyzed the beneficial effect of P. indica association on rice seedlings during high salt stress conditions (200 and 300 mM NaCl). The growth parameters of rice seedlings such as root and shoot lengths or fresh and dry weights were found to be enhanced in P. indica-inoculated rice seedlings as compared with non-inoculated control seedlings, irrespective of whether they are exposed to salt stress or not. However, salt-stressed seedlings performed much better in the presence of the fungus compared with non-inoculated control seedlings. The photosynthetic pigment content [chlorophyll (Chl) a, Chl b, and carotenoids] was significantly higher in P. indica-inoculated rice seedlings under high salt stress conditions as compared with salt-treated non-inoculated rice seedlings, in which these pigments were found to be decreased. Proline accumulation was also observed during P. indica colonization, which may help the inoculated plants to become salt tolerant. Taken together, P. indica rescues growth diminution of rice seedlings under salt stress. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.",Jogawat A.; Saha S.; Bakshi M.; Dayaman V.; Kumar M.; Dua M.; Varma A.; Oelmüller R.; Tuteja N.; Johri A.K.,Plant Signaling and Behavior,2013,10.4161/psb.26891,0.945409011697911,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.982291765548882,0.017708234451118,0.999999998607029,1.39297129386762e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
731,Habitat-scale heterogeneity maintains fungal endophyte diversity in two native prairie legumes,"The assembly of fungal endophyte communities within plants depends on the complex interactions of fungal taxa, their host plants, and the abiotic environment. Prairie plant communities provide a unique avenue to explore the interplay of biotic and abiotic factors affecting endophyte communities, since the historical distribution of prairies spans a broad range of temperature and precipitation, while the distances between small fragments of contemporary prairie communities may challenge the dispersal capabilities of these otherwise ubiquitous fungi. We sampled foliar fungal endophytes from two native prairie legumes, purple and white prairie clovers (Dalea purpurea and D. candida), in 17 remnant prairie sites across Minnesota in order to evaluate the relative contributions of abiotic factors, host species, and dispersal limitation to the diversity and structure of these communities. We found that similarity of communities was significantly associated with their location along a temperature and precipitation gradient, and we showed a distance-decay relationship that suggests dispersal limitations only over very large spatial scales. Although the effect of host species was small relative to these other factors, the two Dalea species maintained distinct communities within sites where they co-occur. Our results illustrate the capacity of many of these endophyte taxa to disperse over large distances and across heterogeneous biotic and abiotic environments and suggest that the interplay of biotic and abiotic factors maintains high diversity observed in endophyte communities.","DeMers, M; May, G",MYCOLOGIA,2021,10.1080/00275514.2020.1813487,0.858873862406895,Relevant,Presence,Absence,Presence,Presence,0.994837116121998,0.0051628838780016,0.0368822676636843,0.963117732336316,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The efficiency assessment of mycorrhizal fungi at ""in vitro"" seed germination of orchids will improve protocols for conservation and horticultural purposes. Applying a culture-dependent approach, we isolated 45 endophytic fungi, from roots of 12 orchid species, growing at two altitudinal levels in the Ecuadorian mountains. From them, 26 Rhizoctonia-like axenical isolates were studied by nuclear ribosomal rDNA sequences analysis, searching for mycorrhizal fungi. Ceratobasidium sp. and Sebacina vermifera were identified and tested for promoting germination and seedling development of Epidendrum secundum Jacq., an endangered medicinal orchid. Symbiotic cultures were stablished in Oat Meal Agar (OMA), and seeds development was compared between Murashige & Skoog enriched medium (MS) and OMA. Germination and seedling development was evaluated during 60 days. Compared with MS medium, symbiotic cultures enhanced plantlets development and significantly reduced germination time. 47.3% and 8.8% of the seeds growing symbiotically with Ceratobasidium sp. and S. vermifera, respectively, reached plantlets stage. The average height from the plantlets growth in symbiotic treatments were higher than MS and OMA treatments (p < .05). E. secundum symbiotically cultured with Ceratobasidium sp. grew higher compared to S. vermifera co-culture. The isolation of two fungi promoting seed germination and development of E. secundum will allow the improvement of ""in vitro"" reproduction of this valuable orchid and might be tested in other endangered species for conservation and reproduction purposes.

The vegetative material for in vitro establishment of avocado explants is from the field, for this reason, the proportion of contamination, oxidation and mortality of explants is elevated, therefore we are looking for alternatives to decreased. Objective. To evaluate concentrations of alternative products for disinfestation in avocado explants cv Duke 7, and decrease oxidation with the addition of L-cysteine in the in vitro establishment. Methodology. The products used were: peroxyacetic acid (AP), chlorine dioxide (DC), and quaternary ammonium salts (ACS), in three concentrations. 54 explants were used in each treatment, and placed in culture medium for establishment, evaluating contamination (%) and oxidation (%). Two weeks later, 50% of viable explants from each treatment were immersed in L-cysteine (100 mgL-1) and placed in a culture medium for multiplication, the rest was placed a in multiplication medium containing L-cysteine; only oxidation was evaluated (%). Contaminated explants were isolated, identified, and characterized fungi and bacteria. Results. The best results of the disinfestation were with ACS with 3.7% contamination, without oxidation. Regarding the use of L-cysteine (100 mgL-1), the lowest percentage of oxidation (47%) was obtained when immersed in a cysteine solution. Three genera of fungi were identified: Aspergillus (3), Penicillium (1) and Cladosporium (1), and Agrobacterium as a bacterium. Implications. With the proposed methodology, we can continue with the following stages of in vitro culture, to establish methodologies for budding, growth, and rooting of avocado clonal rootstocks. Conclusions. The use of ACS and cysteine in solution reduces both contamination and oxidation of explants, but it is necessary to modify concentrations and exposure times in the disinfestation protocol, in addition to identifying even the genus the microorganisms found.

1950,DETERMINATION OF CHITINASE ACTIVITY IN TALL FESCUE BY NEAR-INFRARED REFLECTANCE SPECTROSCOPY,"New cultivars of pasture-type tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreber) lack the fungal endophyte, Acremonium coenophialum Morgan;Tones and W. Gams. Although Acremonium-free cultivars are less toxic to livestock than Acremonium-infected cultivars, they are less disease tolerant. Acremonium-free cultivars may be improved for disease tolerance using a biochemical marker such as chitinase, a defense hydrolase associated with disease resistance in many crops. The objective of this research was to measure chitinase activity in tall fescue seedlings by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS). Ninety-nine seedling samples were freeze-dried, ground, and analyzed for total and specific chitinase activity using tritiated chitin as a substrate. Near infrared spectra were recorded for each sample, and an NIRS equation was developed by regressing radiochemical data against spectral data; regression procedures included forward stepwise multiple regression and modified partial least squares (MPLS). In optimum equations, standard errors of calibration and validation were near or below 10% of the mean, similar to errors observed in routine chemical analysis of chitinase. The optimum equation used MPLS to predict specific activity, resulting in a coefficient of determination of 0.90 and a mean and standard error of 88.8 +/- 7.2 disintegrations min(-1) mg(-1) protein. The NIRS-chitinase procedure is accurate and efficient. Once a spectrophotometer is calibrated, the NIRS procedure is at least 10 times faster than chemical procedures, permitting analysis in 60 s per sample.","ROBERTS, CA; MAREK, SM; LEI, W; KARR, AL",CROP SCIENCE,1994,10.2135/cropsci1994.0011183X003400040043x,0.977064880341516,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998489015607034,0.00151098439296627,0.999999999943945,5.605482744641679e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

7910,"An endophytic fungus interacts with crown level and larval density to reduce the survival of eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), on white spruce (Picea glauca)","A two-year field study was carried out to determine whether inoculating white spruce, Picea glauca (Moench) Voss, with a native endophytic fungus, Phialocephala scopiformis DAOM 229536 Kowalski & Kehr (Helotiales, Ascomycota), decreased the performance of eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana Clemens, developing on these trees. Second instars were reared at three densities in the mid crown and at one density in the lower, mid, and upper crown. Larval survival (i.e., survival of larvae to pupation) was lower on endophyte-inoculated trees than on control trees in the mid crown and especially the upper crown but was similar in the lower crown, resulting in a significant interaction between endophyte and crown level. A similar but marginally insignificant interaction was observed for overall survival up to adult emergence (i.e., total survival). Larval survival and total survival were approximately 22% and 19% lower, respectively, when developing in the upper crown of endophyte-inoculated trees than in control trees. Larval survival remained relatively constant, with increased density on control trees but decreased with density on endophyte-inoculated trees, resulting in a significant interaction between endophyte and larval density. Sex ratios of emerged adults and wing lengths of emerged females were not influenced by the endophyte.

18108,Four new species of Morchella from the Americas.,"Morphological and molecular phylogenetic studies of true morels (Morchella) in North America, the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Peru led to the discovery of four undescribed species of Morchella. Two new species in the Elata clade, one from the Dominican Republic, initially distinguished by the informal designation Mel-18, and a newly discovered sister species from northern Arizona, are now recognized. Mel-18 is described as a novel phylogenetically distinct species, M. hispaniolensis. Its sister species from Arizona is described as M. kaibabensis, also recovered as an endophyte of Rocky Mountain juniper. Two additional species in the Esculenta clade, M. peruviana discovered in Peru and M. gracilis (previously reported as Mes-14) from the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and Ecuador, are described as new.

14978,Endophytic fungus isolated from Zingiber officinale Linn. var. rubrum as a source of antimicrobial compounds,"In Indonesia, red ginger (Zingiber officinale Linn. var. rubrum) is an essential traditional medicine used to treat various ailments. Red ginger plants may have an endophytic fungus capable of producing several bioactive chemicals. This research aimed to identify endophytic fungi and evaluate their antimicrobial efficacy. The fungal strains were isolated from red ginger leaves, stems, and rhizomes by direct planting and pour methods using fungus culture medium and cultivated on rice medium. In the secondary metabolite extraction process, ethyl acetate (EtOAc) is used as a solvent. The agar diffusion procedure examined the EtOAc extract for antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. This study succeeded in isolating 10 fungal strains. The result of antimicrobial screening revealed that the fungal strain JMR4 has a high ability to suppress the development of pathogenic bacteria S. aureus and E. coli, with an inhibition zone of 14.38 ± 1.34 and 16.88 ± 0.69 mm, respectively. The fungus was later identified using the molecular approach, which stated that this fungus is Aspergillus terreus. This research demonstrates that endophytic fungus on red ginger plants may synthesize antibacterial substances crucial for developing novel antibiotics. © 2023 Dian Handayani et al.

5599,Consistent associations with beneficial bacteria in the seed endosphere of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.),"The importance of the plant microbiome for host fitness has led to the concept of the ""plant holobiont"". Seeds are reservoirs and vectors for beneficial microbes, which are very intimate partners of higher plants with the potential to connect plant generations. In this study, the endophytic seed microbiota of numerous barley samples, representing different cultivars, geographical sites and harvest years, was investigated. Cultivation-dependent and -independent analyses, microscopy, functional plate assays, greenhouse assays and functional prediction were used, with the aim of assessing the composition, stability and function of the barley seed endophytic bacterial microbiota. Associations were consistently detected in the seed endosphere with Paenibacillus, Pantoea and Pseudomonas spp., which were able to colonize the root with a notable rhizocompetence after seed germination. In greenhouse assays, enrichment with these bacteria promoted barley growth, improved mineral nutrition and induced resistance against the fungal pathogen Blumeria graminis. We demonstrated here that barley, an important crop plant, was consistently associated with beneficial bacteria inside the seeds. The results have relevant implications for plant microbiome ecology and for the holobiont concept, as well as opening up new possibilities for research and application of seed endophytes as bioinoculants in sustainable agriculture.

13708,Effect of indigenous and introduced vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on growth and phosphorus uptake of Trifolium pratense and on inorganic phosphorus fractions in a cambisol,"Five selected vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi and the native population of a cambisol were tested in sterilized soil conditions, with Trifolium pratense as host plant. Indigenous fungi were the most effective in enhancing plant growth and P uptake, which were correlated with a higher root colonization. Selected fungi did not spread further in the root after 4 months from sowing, occupying less than 10% at the end of the experiment; inoculation with Glomus fasciculatum E3 yielded a higher dry-matter production than any other VAM species, but did not significantly increase shoot P concentration above that of the non-mycorrhizal control. Interactions between indigenous and introduced VAM fungi were studied in unsterilized soil. Results from fresh and dry weights of shoots and the percentage of fungal infection showed that the native endophytes competed more efficiently in colonizing the root. Inoculation with selected VAM species did not improve plant growth. Sterilization altered the inorganic P fractions of the soil, particularly those extracted with NH4F and NaOH. Sterilized soil contained less inorganic P than unsterilized soil, but more soluble P. By the end of the experiment in sterilized soil, P extracted with NH4Cl, NH4F and NaOH and total inorganic P were significantly different among inoculation treatments, suggesting that VAM fungi may differ in their ability to take up P. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.",Sainz M.J.; Arines J.,Biology and Fertility of Soils,1988,10.1007/BF00257921,0.933779197816576,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.981980974816405,0.0180190251835947,0.999999999966302,3.369826639954e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3138,Environmentally dependent host-pathogen and vector-pathogen interactions in the Barley yellow dwarf virus pathosystem,"Understanding environmentally dependent variation in interspecific interactions is needed for evaluating how agroecosystems respond to abiotic stressors, including climate change. Both biotic and abiotic conditions shape crop responses to stress events, but interactions between environmental conditions and insect borne plant pathogens remain poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that drought stress, as applied by experimental water deprivation, drives conditional outcomes in host-pathogen and host-vector interactions using a cereal-aphid-virus association and greenhouse experiments. Under conditions of ample water supply, infection of wheat plants with Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) resulted in reduced above-ground growth, seed set, seed yields and seed germination compared with plants exposed only to non-infected (non-viruliferous) aphids or control plants not subjected to aphid infestation. However, when water was chronically limiting, infection with Barley yellow dwarf virus did not significantly affect plant performance. When wheat was subjected to acute drought stress, plants infected with Barley yellow dwarf virus surpassed both control plants and plants exposed to non-infected aphids in all measured performance traits. Feeding experiments with aphid vectors (Rhopalosiphum padi) and subsequent life table analysis revealed that aphid fecundity improved by 47% when feeding on Barley yellow dwarf virus-infected plants when water inputs were chronically low. However, when plants received ample water, aphid fecundity was enhanced by only 23% from feeding on BYDV-infected plants.Synthesis and applications. Collectively, our experiments suggest that wheat- Barley yellow dwarf virus interactions shift along gradients of water stress severity and duration. When Barley yellow dwarf virus infection preceded water deprivation, plant performance was not reduced from virus infection, and infected plants recovered from severe stress events more readily than non-infected plants. However, vector-pathogen mutualism resulting in enhanced reproduction of aphids on virus-infected plants is likely to amplify direct plant injury from herbivory in the field. Our findings indicate that during periods of drought, management of Barley yellow dwarf virus infection may not be needed and infection could benefit wheat under conditions of acute water stress.

6151,"A survey of endophytic fungi of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) in the Midwest, and their putative roles in plant growth","Endophytic fungi represent a diverse group of Fungi belonging primarily to the Phylum Ascomycota, and exist asymptomatically within tissues of plants. Clavicipitaceous fungal endophytes can promote plant productivity in grasses. Less is known about non-clavicipitaceous endophytes, which are the dominant fungal endophytes in many plants. Panicum uirgatum (switchgrass), a prairie grass native to North America, is a potential candidate as a biofuel crop. Our knowledge of the endophytic fungi of switchgrass and their potential effects on biomass production in this species is limited. To characterize and evaluate endophytic fungi in switchgrass, tillers were collected from a range of habitats across Indiana and Illinois in 2008 and 2009. Endophytic fungi were cultured from surface disinfected aboveground tissues. Morphological characters and sequences of the fungal ITS region were used to identify endophydc fungal isolates. In total, 31 operational taxonomic units were identified, representing fungi belonging to over 11 taxonomic orders. All fungi were members of Ascomycota and most belonged to common genera such as Alternaria, Epicoccum, Phoma, Phaeosphaeria and Stagonospora. No members of the Clavicipitaceae were detected. A greenhouse assay was carried out with a subset of endophyte isolates to determine their impacts on switchgrass biomass production. Experimental inoculations demonstrated that fungi had a range of effects on switchgrass biomass, with 12.5 % and 62.5 % of isolates significantly promoting versus reducing biomass production of test seedlings over controls. Some endophytic fungi of switchgrass may have potential to enhance plant productivity, but net effects of endophyte communities under field conditions need to be explored.

8653,"Isolation, Characterization, and Total DNA Extraction to Identify Endophytic Fungi in Mycoheterotrophic Plants","Mycoheterotrophic plants present one of the most extreme forms of mycorrhizal dependency, having totally lost their autotrophic capacity. As essential as any other vital resource, the fungi with which these plants intimately associate are essential for them. Hence, some of the most relevant techniques in studying mycoheterotrophic species are the ones that enable the investigation of associated fungi, especially those inhabiting roots and subterranean organs. In this context, techniques for identifying culture-dependent and culture-independent endophytic fungi are commonly applied. Isolating fungal endophytes provides a means for morphologically identifying them, analyzing their diversity, and maintaining inocula for applications in the symbiotic germination of orchid seeds. However, it is known that there is a large variety of non-culturable fungi inhabiting plant tissues. Thus, culture-independent molecular identification techniques offer a broader cover of species diversity and abundance. This article aims to provide the methodological support necessary for starting two investigation procedures: a culture-dependent and an independent one. Regarding the culture-dependent protocol, the processes of collecting and maintaining plant samples from collection sites to laboratory facilities are detailed, along with isolating filamentous fungi from subterranean and aerial organs of mycoheterotrophic plants, keeping a collection of isolates, morphologically characterizing hyphae by slide culture methodology, and molecular identification of fungi by total DNA extraction. Encompassing culture-independent methodologies, the detailed procedures include collecting plant samples for metagenomic analyses and total DNA extraction from polymerase chain reaction [PCR], sequencing) are also suggested for analyses, and techniques are presented here.","Sisti, LS; Pena-Passos, M; Mayer, JLS",JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS,2023,10.3791/65135,0.959927544902635,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999377847147774,6.2215285222637e-4,0.99999969777213,3.02227870285776e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

6200,"Metabolomic-Guided Isolation of Bioactive Natural Products from Curvularia sp., an Endophytic Fungus of Terminalia laxiflora",Endophytic fungi associated with medicinal plants are a potential source of novel chemistry and biology. Metabolomic tools were successfully employed to compare the metabolite fingerprints of solid and liquid culture extracts of endophyte Curvularia sp. isolated from the leaves of Terminalia laxiflora . Natural product databases were used to dereplicate metabolites in order to determine known compounds and the presence of new natural products. Multivariate analysis highlighted the putative metabolites responsible for the bioactivity of the fungal extract and its fractions on NF- B and the myelogenous leukemia cell line K562. Metabolomic tools and dereplication studies using high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry directed the fractionation and isolation of the bioactive components from the fungal extracts.

14592,Composition and ecological distribution of endophytic and epiphytic fungi from the foliage of Pteroceltis tatarinowii,"The endophytic and epiphytic fungi from the leaves of Pteroceltis tatarinowii were studied to understand the composition and evolutionary relationship of endophytic and epiphytic fungal communities on this ancient and peculiar plant. This study provides valuable information about fungal resource conservation and an improved understanding of mutual evolutionary relationships between endophytic and epiphytic fungi and their host plants. Additionally, a rich and sizeable collection of endophytic and epiphytic fungi from this specific plant may provide a unique source of bioactive compounds associated with P. tatarinowii. Healthy plant samples were collected from natural distribution areas of P. tatarinowii in Langyashan Natural Reserve, Anhui Province. A total of 2696 isolates of endophytic fungi (839 strains) and epiphytic fungi (1875 strains) were identified and classified into 43 genera, 5 families, and 4 orders. Both species richness and fungal isolation frequency were significantly higher for epiphytic fungi than for endophytic fungi. The dominant order of endophytic (90.23%) and epiphytic fungi (92.51%) was Moniliales. Dematiaceae and Moniliaceae were the dominant families of both endophytic fungi, representing 47.56% and 42.67% of isolates, respectively, and epiphytic fungi, representing 67.04% and 25.47% of isolates, respectively. The dominant genera of endophytic fungi were Periconia (31.47%) and Penicillium (10.73%). Glomerularia (20.03%), Gonatobotrys (13.95%), and Penicillium (12.22%) were the dominant genera of epiphytic fungi. Twenty-three common genera of endophytic and epiphytic fungi were isolated from leaves of P. tatarinowii, accounting for 53. 49% of isolates: Penicillium, Aspergillus, Geotrichum, Gonatobotrys, Streptomyces, Glomerularia, Paecilomyces, Oidiodendron, Trichoderma, Alternaria, Torula, Periconia, Clasterosporium, Phragmocephala, Endophragmia, Stigmella, Acaulopage, Spiromyces, Syncephalastrum, Choanephora, Phomopsis, Gloeosporium, and Marssonina. Six genera (19 strains, 0.70%; Oedocephalum, Gilmaniella, Pithomyces, Trichaegum, Colletotrichum, and Sphaceloma) were unique to endophytic fungi, and 14 genera (120 strains, 4.45%; Candida, Botrytis, Tritirachium, Trichothecium, Thallospora, Basidiobotrys, Chaetopsis, Bipolaris, Menispora, Cordana, Polythrincium, Cochlonema, Mycotypha, and Stylopage) were unique to epiphytic fungi. Differences in the composition of endophytic and epiphytic fungi existed at different sampling locations. Periconia (20. 5%), Penicillium (5. 24%), Trichoderma (8. 70%), and Streptomyces (5.13%) were the dominant genera of endophytic fungi from the sunward-facing sample leaves, whereas, the dominant genera of epiphytic fungi were Glomerularia (20.03%), Penicillium (11.74%), Periconia (6.84%), and Gonatobotrys (5. 65%). The dominant genera of endophytic fungi from the shade sample leaves included Periconia (11.08%), Penicillium (5.48%), and Oidiodendron (6.20%), whereas the dominant genus of epiphytic fungi was Gonatobotrys (6.57%). Periconia was the dominant genus of endophytic fungi isolated from the upper (17.76%) and lower (13.59%) leaves. Penicillium was the dominant genus of epiphytic fungi isolated from the upper (8.94%) and lower (5.01%) leaves. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H′ =2.44) and Margalef richness index (R = 2.88) of endophytic fungi were less than that of epiphytic fungi (H′ =2.57, R =3.32). The endophytic and epiphytic fungal communities of P. tatarinowii had a similarity coefficient of 0.70.

20096,ISOLATION PROCEDURES FOR ENDOPHYTES HARVESTING,"Endophytes are plant associated microorganisms that colonize the inner parts of the plants without causing disease symptoms. The associations between endophyte microbiota and their host plants are diverse and complex. The load and spectrum of endophytes varies with the host plant, host tissue and plant part, plant age and environmental conditions in which host plants are growing. It is believed that only a small percent of endophytes can be cultivated, therefore isolation and growth procedures are essential in endophyte harvesting. The plant surface disinfection procedures are also important, as they eliminate the competition of rhizosphere and epiphyte microorganisms, while preserving the viability of the endophyte community. The interest in improving endophyte harvest is mostly due to their beneficial traits. Solid evidence revealed that endophytes are involved in plant growth promotion and protection against biotic and abiotic stress. Beside the agricultural benefits, there are also aspects that involve environmental protection, where endophyte microorganisms improve the phytoremediation process. The isolation of new endophytic strains could also lead to new antibiotics detection. Therefore, endophytes are hunted for various biotechnological fields and processes.","Boiu-Sicuia, OA; Cornea, CP",AGROLIFE SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL,2019,NA,0.921211031287883,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.454244705232149,0.545755294767851,0.999491090474022,5.0890952597848e-4,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
6153,Diversity of Fungal Endophytes in Various Tissues of Panax ginseng Meyer Cultivated in Korea,"Endophytic fungi were isolated from various tissues (root, stem, petiole, leaf, and flower stalk) of 3- and 4-year-old ginseng plants (Panax ginseng Meyer) cultivated in Korea. The isolated endophytic fungi were identified based on the sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), 1-5.8-ITS 2. A morphological characterization was also conducted using microscopic observations. According to the identification, 127 fungal isolates were assigned to 27 taxa. The genera of Phoma, Alternaria and Colletotrichum were the most frequent isolates, followed by Fusarium, Entrophospora and Xylaria. Although 19 of the 27 taxa were identified at the species level, the remainder were classified at the genus level (6 isolates), phylum level (Ascomycota, 1 isolate), and unknown fungal species (1 isolate). Endophytic fungi of 13 and 19 species were isolated from 3- and 4-year-old ginseng plants, respectively, and Phoma radicina and Fusarium solani were the most frequently isolated species colonizing the tissues of the 3- and 4-year-old ginseng plants, respectively. The colonization frequency (CF%) was dependant on the age and tissue examined: the CFs of the roots and stems in the 3-year-old ginseng were higher than the CF of tissues in the 4-year-old plants. In contrast, higher CFs were observed in the leaves and petioles of 4-year-old plants, and endophytic fungi in the flower stalks were only detected in the 4-year-old plants. In conclusion, we detected diverse endophytic fungi in ginseng plants, which were distributed differently depending on the age and tissue examined.","Park, YH; Lee, SG; Ahn, DJ; Kwon, TR; Park, SU; Lim, HS; Bae, H",JOURNAL OF GINSENG RESEARCH,2012,10.5142/jgr.2012.36.2.211,0.95812222595633,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.797214133602845,0.202785866397155,0.999985124951768,1.48750482324989e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

CECT-13092, an endophytic fungal strain recently isolated and identified from an eucalyptus tree in Spain, was investigated in different biorefineries-industrial processes. The strain was used to improve the enzymatic saccharification and pulping of Eucalyptus globulus wood; and liquid culture of the strain enriched in laccase activity was used for E. globulus Kraft pulp biobleaching in the presence of acetosyringone as mediator. RESULTS: With regard to enzymatic saccharification, treatment with Hormonema sp. and autohydrolysis pretreatment boosted enzymatic hydrolysis (eight-fold increase in sugar yields compared with control without any pretreatment). This fungus provided 26.7% higher delignification than the control during Kraft pulping and a higher refining degree during mechanical pulping (69 degrees SR vs. 48 degrees SR control). Chemical and mechanical pulps from fungal pretreatment also showed better physical properties than control pulps (increases in tensile, tear and burst indexes of 28.4%, 15.6% and 43.9%, respectively). Regarding biobleaching, after the enzymatic treatment and a hydrogen peroxide stage, a brightness increase (2.3 points %ISO) was obtained.

Effects of inoculation of two endophytic fungi (Piriformospora indica and Sebacina vermifera) in growth, yield and composition of the essential oil of fennel (F. vulgare) were evaluated in pot cultures. Dry fruits were ground with an electric grinder and oil was extracted by hydrodistillation, and their composition was determined by GC/MS. In pot experiment, the maximum dry weight of the green tissue and root and plant height were obtained with P. indica, and maximum number of umbels per plant and dry weight of 1000 fruits were produced with S. vermifera. The P. indica and S. vermifera inoculation significantly increased oil yield as compared to non-inoculated control plants.

15861,An endophytic Penicillium oxalicum isolated from Citrus limon possesses antioxidant and genoprotective potential,"Aims: This study aimed at isolating endophytic fungi from Citrus limon (L.) possessing antioxidative and genoprotective potential. Methods and Results: Endophytic fungi were screened for antioxidant activity using 2,2-diphenyl,1-picryl hydrazyl radical scavenging assay and maximum activity (79·70%) was exhibited by culture MP1 identified to be Penicillium oxalicum on the basis of morphological and molecular characteristics. The ethyl acetate extract of MP1 was subjected to silica column chromatography followed by LH 20 column chromatography for purification of active metabolites. The partially purified active fraction of P. oxalicum MP1 possessed good antioxidant activity as detected using various assays. It also exhibited a strong DNA damage protection potential on pUC19 plasmid DNA treated with Fenton reagent. On exposure to active fraction of MP1 significant reduction (P < 0·05) in nuclear deformities (like nuclear buds, micronuclei, nuclear ridges and binucleated cells) was observed in human lymphocytes pretreated with a toxic concentration of H2O2. In vivo genoprotectivity studies were conducted in fresh water fish Channa punctatus pretreated with a damaging compound 4-nonyl phenol. The active fraction of P. oxalicum MP1 caused a reduction of 94·7 and 66·60% in micronuclei and aberrant cell formation, respectively. A significant reduction (P < 0·05) in tail length and tail DNA parameters was also observed in comet assay. Conclusion: The endophytic P. oxalicum isolated in this study has the potential to produce metabolites possessing antioxidant and genoprotective activities.

2579,Fungal root colonization responses in natural grasslands after long-term exposure to elevated atmospheric CO2,"Arbuscular mycorrhizae, ubiquitous mutualistic symbioses between plant roots and fungi in the order Glomales, are believed to be important controllers of plant responses to global change, in particular to elevated atmospheric CO2. In order to test if any effects on the symbiosis can persist after long-term treatment, we examined root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and other fungi of several plant species from two grassland communities after continuous exposure to elevated atmospheric CO2 for six growing seasons in the field. For plant species from both a sandstone and a serpentine annual grassland there was evidence for changes in fungal root colonization, with changes occurring as a function of giant host species. We documented decreases in percentage nonmycorrhizal fungal root colonization in elevated CO2 for several plant species. Total AM root colonization (%) only increased significantly for one out of the five plant species in each grassland. However, when dividing AM fungal hyphae into two groups of hyphae (fine endophyte and coarse endophyte), we could document significant responses of AM fungi that were hidden when only total percentage colonization was measured. We also documented changes in elevated CO2 in the percentage of root colonized by both AM hyphal types simultaneously. Our results demonstrate that changes in fungal root colonization can occur after long-term CO2 enrichment, and that the level of resolution of the study of AM fungal responses may have to be increased to uncover significant changes to the CO2 treatment. This study is also one of the first to document compositional changes in the AM fungi colonizing roots of plants grown in elevated CO2. Although it is difficult to relate the structural data directly to functional changes, possible implications of the observed changes for plant communities are discussed.","Rillig, MC; Field, CB; Allen, MF",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,1999,10.1046/j.1365-2486.1999.00251.x,0.985630407599457,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994486573146486,0.00551342685351407,0.999999999999587,4.12669898253171e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16589,Production of aseptic spores of vesicular-arbuscular endophytes and their viability after chemical and physical stress.,"The survival of germinating spores of vesicular-arbuscular endophytes after treatments with oxidizing agents, antibiotics, moist heat, ultrasonic radiation, and ultraviolet radiation was compared with that of their contaminating microbes. Spores of three species were rapidly decontaminated by treatment with 0.42% (wt/vol) chlorine available from 5.0% (wt/vol) chloramine-T at 30 degrees C for 20 to 40 min depending on the species and the soil from which they were extracted. This treatment did not change spore viability. The survival of spores was reduced by exposure for 20 min to 1.11% chlorine at 30 degrees C for Glomus caledonius or at 35 degrees C for Acaulospora laevis. Growth of any bacteria surviving treatment with oxidizing agents was inhibited by 100 mug of chloramphenicol per ml in agar; however, spore germination and germ tube growth were reduced only by concentrations greater than 200 mug/ml in agar. Spore germination was decreased by concentration of pimaracin, which controlled fungal growth. The spores survived moist heat at 40 degrees C for 80 min, 55 degrees C for 10 min, and 60 degrees C for less than 1 min. The viability of spores was unaffected by ultrasonic irradiation for up to 4 min. Spores of G. caledonius and A. laevis were extremely resistant to ultraviolet radiation. Their viability was unaffected by exposure to 5 x 10 ergs cm from an ultraviolet source of 253.7nm. The spores had very thick, pigmented walls, and the possibility that these provided some protection against the physical and chemical treatments is discussed.

1821,Global Distribution and Influencing Factors of Plant-Available Phosphorus in (Semi-)Natural Soils,"Phosphorus (P) is frequently a limiting nutrient for plant growth in natural ecosystems. Determining plant-available P concentration in soil is essential for pinpointing areas where P availability might restrict plant growth and terrestrial carbon sequestration. However, the worldwide distribution and factors influencing plant-available P in (semi-)natural soils are not well understood. Here, we have developed a comprehensive global database that compiles plant-available P measurements using five prevalent analytical methods: Olsen, Bray-1, Mehlich III, Colwell, and AB-DTPA. The data set encompasses 6,253 plant-available P measurements in (semi-)natural soils (under natural ecosystems and >10 years since anthropogenic activities) at 3,353 globally distributed sites. Leveraging this extensive database, we initially examined the global distribution and influencing factors of plant-available soil P. Subsequently, we utilized a random forest model to delineate a detailed global map of plant-available soil P patterns. Globally, plant-available P varied over four orders of magnitude, from 0.01 to 99.2 mg kg(-1). The variation was best explained by parent material types and total soil P concentration. Random forest predicted plant-available P increased significantly with latitude in both hemispheres, though with large longitudinal variations. Global stock of plant-available P was estimated to be 0.73 Pg and 1.59 Pg at 0-30 cm and 30-100 cm soil depths. Our analysis provides insight into the underlying drivers of plant-available P in (semi-)natural soils, presents a spatially explicit assessment of plant-available soil P, which can provide a basis for assessing, predicting, and understanding global patterns of terrestrial P limitation and the functioning of the Earth system.","Luo, XZ; Guo, CH; He, XJ; Helfenstein, J; Lambers, H; Ren, QQ; Ibrahim, MM; Li, ZM; Lin, HY; Chang, ZF; Zhang, LL; Wen, DZ; Hou, EQ",GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES,2025,10.1029/2025GB008513,0.940109939861196,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997466590238572,0.00253340976142761,0.999999919789369,8.02106306929673e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The colonization pattern was monitored via inoculation of DsRED fluorescent protein-expressing F. oryzae on rice roots. To investigate the resistance induced by F. oryzae, the leaves of control and F. oryzae-colonized plants were inoculated with pathogenic Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo). The results showed that foliar infection of control plants with Xoo resulted in serious blight lesions. The disease ranged at rank 7 and 9 which accounted for 43.33% and 34.67%, respectively. The disease index was up to 79.26. Upon infestation with F. oryzae, leaves were protected from Xoo infection as evidenced by reductions in lesion size and severity, only with a few hypersensitive spots. It was clear that 8% of F. oryzaecolonized plants was not infected by Xoo. A large proportion of F. oryzae-infected plants ranged at rank 1, accounting for 72%, while its disease index was reduced to 15.26. The biocontrol efficiency of F. oryzae against Xoo was up to 80.75%. F. oryzae-inoculated roots showed 5.26-fold greater superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in comparison with controls. Meanwhile, catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) activities were elevated by 12.08- and 10.53-fold after infestation with F. oryzae, respectively. Due to the colonization of F. oryzae, the expressions of PR1a and PR1b were significantly up-regulated by 8.71- and 3.37-fold, while the expressions of AOS, OsSAUR2 and EL5 were significantly down-regulated by 0.28-, 0.57- and 0.65-fold, respectively.

All bacteria with positive hypersensitivity reaction on tobacco and geranium leaves and potato soft rot were eliminated, and totally 39 isolates were selected for in vitro antagonism and greenhouse tests. The potential biocontrol isolates were evaluated using seed treatment and soil drench methods on two tomato cultivars. The results indicated that seven bacterial isolates had a high potential for the control of the fungus and reduced the severity disease to 95-98%. This reduction was coincided with an increase in some growth factors like plant dry weight, root dry weight, plant height, root length, root fresh weight and plant fresh weight ranged between 92-98%. The seven antagonists' preliminary identification was confirmed using 16SrRNA gene sequencing analysis. The BLAST analysis was performed, and the bacteria were also identified as Bacillus pumilus (two isolates), Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus safensis, Enterobacter ludwigi, Serratia marcesens and Pseudomonas beatica. Biocontrol mechanisms examination indicated that protease production was positive for all isolates and differentiated isolates E. ludwigii and P. beatica as higher producers with protease levels up to 65%.

15699,TIME SCENARIOS OF INTERACTION IN “TOMATO SEEDLINGS - Alternaria - FUNGAL ENDOPHYTES”,"In biological control one of the most common approaches is selecting microorganisms with antagonistic traits. Yet, indirect mechanisms of plant growth promotion may give advantages in biotic stress by allowing plants to overcome the colonization of the pathogen. Rapid methods of combined antagonistic and plant growth promotion traits are scarce. Here we propose a method for screening potentially bioactive fungal endophytes in a tripartite interaction “endophytes - Alternaria - tomato seedlings”. Endophytes are known to interact with pathogens chemically inhibiting their growth or development by means of specific biologically active metabolites, mycoparasitism, or by competition for nutrients, or indirectly by inducing resistance mechanisms in the host. The proposed method here could substitute the conventional assays of antagonism in dual culture (i.e. fungus – fungus), having introduced from the beginning the central biological actor, the plant. Results indicate that the order of arrival of each actor determines if seedling colonization or enhancement of seedling growth occur as the antagonistic interaction between endophyte and pathogen may precede the latter beneficial interactions.

Few experimental studies with wild grassendophyte symbiota, compared to endophyte-infected agricultural grasses, have tested for anti-insect benefits, let alone for resistance against more than one insect species. This study quantified the preference and performance of the bird cherry oat-aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and the cereal leaf beetle, Oulema melanopus (L.) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), two important pests of forage and cereal grasses, on Neotyphodium-infected (E+) and uninfected (E-) plants of the wild grass Alpine timothy, Phleum alpinum L. (Poales: Poaceae). The experiments tested for both constitutive and wound-induced resistance in E+ plants to characterize possible plasticity of defense responses by a wild E+ grass. The aphid, R. padi preferred E- over E+ test plants in choice experiments and E+ undamaged test plants constitutively expressed antibiosis resistance to this aphid by suppressing population growth. Prior damage of E+ test plants did not induce higher levels of resistance to R. padi. By contrast, the beetle, O. melanopus showed no preference for E+ or E- test plants and endophyte infection did not adversely affect the survival and development of larvae. These results extend the phenomenon of variable effects of E+ wild grasses on the preference and performance of phytophagous insects.

The results after 30 days showed that the lesion lengths in the phloem after inoculation with S.polyspora were significantly longer than for the control. In addition, the fungus caused partly distinct chlorisis or discolouration of needles 14 days after inoculation. This suggests that S.polyspora is able to colonize stem phloem and pine needles of P.yunnanensis and thus may cause secondary damages to this host after being spread with bark beetles.","Pan, Y; Ye, H; Lu, J; Chen, P; Zhou, XD; Qiao, M; Yu, ZF",JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY,2018,10.1111/jph.12696,0.937099800219643,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999971561400388,2.84385996116061e-5,0.999999999999419,5.80979708786344e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12333,Eutypella parasitica and Other Frequently Isolated Fungi in Wood of Dead Branches of Young Sycamore Maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) in Slovenia,"Eutypella parasitica R.W. Davidson and R.C. Lorenz is the causative agent of Eutypella canker of maple, a destructive disease of maples in Europe and North America. The fungus E. parasitica infects the trunk through a branch stub or bark wound. Because the fungal community may have an impact on infection and colonization by E. parasitica, the composition of fungi colonizing wood of dead branches of sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) was investigated in five sampling sites in Slovenia. Forty samples from each sampling site were collected between the November 2017 and March 2018 period. Isolations were made from the wood in the outer part of dead branches and from discoloured wood in the trunk that originated from a dead branch. Pure cultures were divided into morphotypes, and one representative culture per morphotype was selected for further molecular identification. From a total of 2700 cultured subsamples, 1744 fungal cultures were obtained, which were grouped into 212 morphotypes. The investigated samples were colonized by a broad spectrum of fungi. The most frequently isolated species were Eutypamaura (Fr.) Sacc., Eutypa sp. Tul. and C. Tul., Fusarium avenaceum (Fr.) Sacc., Neocucurbitaria acerina Wanas., Camporesi, E.B.G. Jones and K.D. Hyde and E. parasitica. In this study, we distinguished species diversity and the fungal community. There were no significant differences in the diversity of fungal species between the five sampling sites, and branch thickness did not prove to be a statistically significant factor in fungal species diversity. Nevertheless, relatively low Jaccard similarity index values suggested possible differences in the fungal communities from different sampling sites. This was confirmed by an analysis of similarities, which showed that the isolated fungal community distinctly differed between the five sampling sites and between the different isolation sources. Eutypella parasitica was isolated from all five investigated sampling sites, although Eutypella cankers were observed in only three sampling sites, indicating the possibility of asymptomatic infection.","Brglez, A; Piskur, B; Ogris, N",FORESTS,2020,10.3390/f11040467,0.978359477895922,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998202037816427,0.00179796218357338,0.999999999658966,3.41033867812257e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

14475,Molecular analysis of polysaccharide accumulation in: Dendrobium nobile infected with the mycorrhizal fungus Mycena sp.,"Polysaccharides are among the most important active compounds of Dendrobium nobile Lindl., and they improve immunity, strengthen memory, and prevent and fight tumours. Evidence suggests that the mycorrhizal fungus Mycena sp. may increase the polysaccharide content of D. nobile. To understand the regulatory mechanism by which Mycena sp. promotes polysaccharide accumulation in D. nobile, a model including MF23 (Mycena sp.) and D. nobile was developed. Content measurements and electron microscopy showed that the change in polysaccharides was associated with the level of colonization. Large-scale transcriptome sequencing analyses of D. nobile infected with MF23 and of wild D. nobile revealed that 30 unigenes encoding key enzymes were potentially associated with polysaccharide accumulation. A qRT-PCR experiment involving 13 randomly chosen unigenes suggested that the combined effects of the carbohydrate biosynthesis and consumption pathways resulted in changes in polysaccharide levels. MF23 might increase polysaccharide level by inducing genes involved in photosynthesis (petF), starch and sucrose metabolism (SUS, bcsA, glgA) and fructose and mannose metabolism (PMM, GPMM) and by repressing genes involved in glycolysis (PGK, PFK) and the citrate cycle (PDHB, CS, SDHA).

8005,Interaction between a fungal endophyte and root herbivores of Ammophila arenaria,"The effect of an endophytic fungus (Acremoniurn strictum) on plant-growth related parameters of marram grass (Ammophila arenaria), and its potential as a protective agent against root herbivores (Pratylenchus dunensis and Pratylenchus penetrans, root-lesion nematodes) was investigated in two inoculation experiments under different conditions. Acremonium strictum-inoculated plants showed increased plant development in terms of root biomass in the first experiment and increased number of titters in the second experiment and biomass was less suppressed by nematodes than the Acremonium strictum-free plants. In neither experiment did Acremonium strictum reduce multiplication of root herbivores. On the contrary, Acremonium strictum-inocutated plants seemed to increase herbivore multiptication. Plants infected with P. penetrans benefitted more from the endophytic fungus than those with P. dunensis in terms of total biomass. The effect of Acremonium strictum on interspecific competition was also analyzed by plant inoculation with both nematode species. In Acremonium strictum-free plants with mixed nematode inoculum, the total number of nematodes, compared to numbers observed in one-species inoculation, was less than expected, suggesting that interspecific: competition took place. In Acremonium strictum-inocutated plants no interspecific competition was observed. Plants inoculated with P. dunensis, P. penetrans and Acremonium strictum showed decreased total biomass compared to Acremonium strictum-free plants inoculated with the same nematodes. The implications of increased tittering and root growth of plants with Acremonium endophytes are discussed in relation to the sand stabilizing rote of Ammophila arenaria in coastal dunes.

3242,Analysis of the Mycotoxin Levels and Expression Pattern of SWN Genes at Different Time Points in the Fungus Slafractonia leguminicola,"The fungal plant pathogen Slafractonia leguminicola produces two mycotoxins that affect animals: slaframine, which causes slobbers, and swainsonine, which causes locoism. Slafractonia leguminicola contains the swainsonine-associated orthologous gene clusters, ""SWN"", which include a multifunctional swnK gene (NRPS-PKS hybrid), swnH1 and swnH2 (nonheme iron dioxygenase genes), swnN and swnR (reductase genes), and swnT (transmembrane transporter). In addition to these genes, two paralogs of swnK, swnK1 (paralog1) and swnk2 (paralog2), are found in S. leguminicola. cDNAs from total mRNA were isolated from the S. leguminicola mycelia grown in the culture plates as well as from leaves inoculated with the fungal mycelia at different time points, and expression pattern of the SWN genes were analyzed using RT-qPCR. The concentrations of swainsonine and slaframine production from this fungus at different time points were also examined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The timing of gene expression was similar in cultured fungus and inoculated leaves and agreed with our proposed biosynthetic pathway. Substantially more swainsonine was produced than slaframine during time course studies.","Das, S; Gardner, DR; Cook, D; Creamer, R",MICROORGANISMS,2024,10.3390/microorganisms12040670,0.938464880471046,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999739501112399,2.6049888760083e-4,0.999997771657619,2.22834238050584e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1558,"Contig assembly and microsynteny analysis using a bacterial artificial chromosome library for Epichloe festucae, a mutualistic fungal endophyte of grasses","We constructed and characterized a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library for Epichloe festucae, a genetically tractable fungal plant mutualist. The 6144 clone library with an average insert size of 87 kb represents at least 18-fold coverage of the 29 Mb genome. We used the library to assemble a 110 kb contig spanning the putative ornithine decarboxylase (odc) ortholog and subsequently expanded it to 228 kb with a single walking step in each direction. Furthermore, we evaluated conservation of microsynteny between E festucae and some model filamentous fungi by comparing sequence available from a 43 kb region at the end of one BAC to publicly available fungal genome sequences. Orthologs to the 13 contiguous open reading frames (ORFs) identified in E. festucae are syntenic in Neurospora crassa and Magnaporthe grisea occurring in small sets of two, three or four colinear ORFs.

17379,First Report of Sclerotinia Stem Rot of Anemone Caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in Korea.,"In Korea, anemones (Anemone coronaria L.) are mostly grown during winter, in polyethylene tunnels that may have high humidity and poor ventilation, to meet the high demand of cut flowers in February and March for school ceremonies. During the winter of 2011 to 2012, symptoms typical of Sclerotinia stem rot were observed in commercial crops of anemone (cv. Rosso Mistral Plus) in Hwaseong City, Korea. About 40% of anemones withered or died before harvest due to the disease, causing considerable economic losses. In one farmer's polyethylene tunnel with a good ventilation system in Icheon City, Korea, less than 1% of the anemones showed Sclerotinia stem rot during the same season. Symptoms included stem necrosis and withering of leaves, followed by crown rot and wilt a few days afterward. White cottony growth of the fungus was observed on dead plants and the nearby soil surface, especially under high relative humidity. Black sclerotia 2 to 7 mm in diameter developed in the mycelium. Isolations from surface-disinfested stem pieces onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) consistently yielded white, fluffy colonies. Two-week-old colonies produced plentiful numbers of sclerotia on PDA. The isolated fungus was morphologically identified as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary (1,3). Voucher specimens (n = 4) were deposited in the Korea University herbarium (KUS). Two isolates were deposited in the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection with accession numbers KACC46708 (ex KUS-F26433) and KACC46834 (ex KUS-F26437), respectively. Fungal DNA was extracted with a DNeasy Plant Mini DNA Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified with the primers ITS1/ITS4 (4) and sequenced using an ABI Prism 337 automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). The resulting sequences of 501 bp were deposited in GenBank (Accession Nos. KC412065 and KC412066). A BLAST search revealed that sequences of the two Korean isolates showed 100% identity with those of S. sclerotiorum (e.g., GenBank Accession No. JN012606). A pathogenicity test was achieved by placing agar segments (9 mm2) from a 7-day-old culture grown on PDA on the stems of healthy anemones (cv. Rosso Mistral Plus) near the soil line. Three plants inoculated with agar blocks served as controls. Plants were maintained in a greenhouse at 16 to 20°C and relative humidity >90%. After 2 days, all inoculated stems became discolored, soft, watery, and covered with white mycelia, whereas control plants remained symptomless. S. sclerotiorum was consistently reisolated from the symptomatic tissue, fulfilling Koch's postulates. Sclerotinia stem rot of anemones caused by S. sclerotiorum has previously been recorded from the United States and New Zealand (2), and to our knowledge, this is the first report of S. sclerotiorum on anemone in Korea. According to our observations in damaged plots, low temperature, high humidity, poor ventilation, and continuous cultivation would accelerate the incidence of Sclerotinia stem rot in polyethylene tunnel cultivation systems in Korea.

11936,Differential Expression of Fungal Genes Determines the Lifestyle of Plectosphaerella Strains During Arabidopsis thaliana Colonization,"The fungal genus Plectosphaerella comprises species and strains with different lifestyles on plants, such as P cucumerina, which has served as model for the characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana basal and nonhost resistance to necrotrophic fungi. We have sequenced, annotated, and compared the genomes and transcriptomes of three Plectosphaerella strains with different lifestyles on A. thaliana, namely, PcBMM, a natural pathogen of wild-type plants (Col-0), Pc2127, a nonpathogenic strain on Col-0 but pathogenic on the immunocompromised cyp79B2 cyp79B3 mutant, and P0831, which was isolated from a natural population of A. thaliana and is shown here to be nonpathogenic and to grow epiphytically on Col-0 and cyp79B2 cyp79B3 plants. The genomes of these Plectosphaerella strains are very similar and do not differ in the number of genes with pathogenesis-related functions, with the exception of secreted carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), which are up to five times more abundant in the pathogenic strain PcBMM. Analysis of the fungal transcriptomes in inoculated Col-0 and cyp79B2 cyp79B3 plants at initial colonization stages confirm the key role of secreted CAZymes in the necrotrophic interaction, since PcBMM expresses more genes encoding secreted CAZymes than Pc2127 and P0831. We also show that P0831 epiphytic growth on A. thaliana involves the transcription of specific repertoires of fungal genes, which might be necessary for epiphytic growth adaptation. Overall, these results suggest that in-planta expression of specific sets of fungal genes at early stages of colonization determine the diverse lifestyles and pathogenicity of Plectosphaerella strains.","Muñoz-Barrios, A; Sopeña-Torres, S; Ramos, B; López, G; del Hierro, I; Díaz-González, S; González-Melendi, P; Mélida, H; Fernández-Calleja, V; Mixao, V; Martín-Dacal, M; Marcet-Houben, M; Gabaldón, T; Sacristán, S; Molina, A",MOLECULAR PLANT-MICROBE INTERACTIONS,2020,10.1094/MPMI-03-20-0057-R,0.722705523471604,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.931941365627059,0.0680586343729407,0.999997362976238,2.63702376168684e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
4328,Efficacy of endophytic wild strains of entomopathogenic fungi against the tomato leafminer Tuta absoluta Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) in tomato plants,"BackgroundTomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is a vegetable of great economic value. The tomato leafminer Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is a serious pest of tomato. Its control is difficult due to the protection of the larvae in the galleries they create its fast resistance development too many active ingredients and due to its many generations per year. Many entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) have been reported as endophytes for various plant pathogens and pests. In this study, the endophyticity of Beauveria bassiana Balsamo (Vuillemin) (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) and Metarhizium anisopliae (Metchnikoff) Sorokin (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae) isolated from the soils of Crete against larvae of T. absoluta in tomato plants was examined.ResultsAs a result, the EPF isolates of Crete decreased both the distance of larval travel from the egg to the opening of the gallery and the weight of the T. absoluta larvae, but also colonized the tomato plants. The entomopathogenic fungi were isolated from tomatoes again. Mycelium began to appear 7 days later and had developed completely after 12 days at 25 +/- 2 degrees C and in 95% RH. Interestingly, the period between the hatched egg and the emerged first instar T. absoluta larvae was affected significantly by the different treatments, but not by ""repetition"" or ""plant"". Interestingly, the distance was further significantly shortened after treatment with M. anisopliae isolate Crete and B. bassiana isolate Crete and the commercial strain. The development period of T. absoluta larvae varied significantly among the treatments, but not by repetition in time or plant. The treatments caused a significant variation in the weight of T. absoluta pupae. The lowest weight was recorded in the plants colonized by M. anisopliae isolate Crete.ConclusionsThe study demonstrated the ability of the B. bassiana and M. anisopliae from Crete to colonize the tomato plants and the wild strains of Crete affect the distance of larvae. With the presence of endophytic EPF, the period between the hatched egg and the emerged first instar T. absoluta larvae was decreased, as does the weight of the T. absoluta pupae.","Giannoulakis, E; Mantzoukas, S; Lagogiannis, I; Dervisoglou, S; Perdikis, D",EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL PEST CONTROL,2023,10.1186/s41938-023-00663-6,0.984044426921527,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999987449020161,1.25509798387384e-5,0.999999999952526,4.7473802666786495e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
9144,"Biosynthesis of Isoprene Units in Euphorbia lathyris Laticifers vs. Other Tissues: MVA and MEP Pathways, Compartmentation and Putative Endophytic Fungi Contribution","Euphorbia species are characterized by a net of laticifers producing large amounts of triterpenes. These hydrocarbon-like metabolites can be converted into fuel by the methods of the oil industry. Euphorbia lathyris is easily grown at an industrial scale. In an attempt to increase its triterpene production, the metabolic pathways leading to isoprenoid were investigated by incorporation of C-13 labeled glucose and mevalonate and H-2 labeled deoxyxylulose as well as by natural abundance isotope ratio GC-MS. Latex triterpenes are exclusively synthesized via the mevalonate (MVA) pathway: this may orient future search for improving the triterpene production in E. lathyris. Phytosterols and their precursors are mainly derived from MVA pathway with a slight contribution of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, whereas phytol is issued from MEP pathway with a minor contribution of the MVA pathway: this is in accordance with the metabolic cross-talk between cytosolic and plastidial compartments in plants. In addition, hopenol B behaved differently from the other latex triterpenes. Its C-13 isotope abundance after incorporation of C-13 labeled glucose and its natural abundance delta H-2 signature clearly differed from those of the other latex triterpenes indicating another metabolic origin and suggesting that it may be synthesized by an endophytic fungus.","Gastaldo, C; Lipko, A; Motsch, E; Adam, P; Schaeffer, P; Rohmer, M",MOLECULES,2019,10.3390/molecules24234322,0.950908536876947,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.92432587947562,0.0756741205243796,0.999993083919702,6.91608029790292e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
13988,"Biosynthesis of Silver Nanoparticles from Endophytic Fungi, and its Cytotoxic Activity","Nanoparticle research is currently an area of intense scientific interest due to a wide variety of potential applications in biomedical, optical, and electronic fields. The biological synthesis of nanoparticles includes the synthesis of nanoparticles using microbes which have the capability to absorb the nanoparticles that exist in various forms. In the biosynthesis of metal nanoparticles by a fungus Botryodiplodia theobromae, the fungus mycelium is exposed to the metal salt solution. The change in color of the medium indicates the synthesis of silver nanoparticles. The synthesized AgNPs were structurally characterized by UV-visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. The size of the silver nanoparticles was ranging from 62.77 –103 nm in the fungal mat and 66.75–111.23 nm in the cell filtrate respectively with the existence of free OH and NH groups, aromatic CH stretch, C–C stretch, unsaturation in the molecule, and C–Cl stretch. The cytotoxic efficiency of the AgNPs on human MCF7 breast cancer cell lines and A549 human lung cancer cell lines was appraised by cell viability assay. The synthesized AgNPs inhibited the propagation of cells at an IC50 concentration of 100 μg/mL. Thus, this study reveals that the green synthesis is an eco-friendly method for production of AgNPs from endophytic fungi which provided a powerful anti-proliferative action on MCF-7 and A549 cell lines, suggesting them as a novel chemotherapeutic agent against human breast and lung cancers. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Janakiraman V.; Govindarajan K.; Magesh C.R.,BioNanoScience,2019,10.1007/s12668-019-00631-1,0.612904520301606,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.913606223773417,0.0863937762265829,0.999999312863016,6.87136983756886e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

The aims of the research were as follows: (i) to determine the levels of colonization of Polish-grown cultivars of perennial ryegrass, meadow fescue, and red fescue with endophytic fungi of the genera Neotyphodium and Epichloe; (ii) to determine the potential hazards associated with the toxins produced by the active associations; (iii) to isolate viable endophytes of the genera Neotyphodium and Epichloe from active associations; and (iv) to determine the levels of antagonistic activity of the obtained endophyte isolates against selected microorganisms, in particular serious grass pathogens, in vitro. The staining method was used for endophytes detection in grass seed collection. Endophytes were isolated on PDA medium and characterized. Antagonistic activity of N/E isolates and seed extracts were determined in dual culture assays and on microscope slides respectively. Ergovaline and lolitrem B content were assayed. There were 242 samples of seeds of 50 cultivars of grasses collected in Poland, including 124 samples of 20 cultivars of perennial ryegrass, 61 samples of 10 cultivars of meadow fescue, and 57 samples of 20 cultivars of red fescue. Endophytic fungi were only detected in 33 seed samples of 5 perennial ryegrass cultivars and in 15 samples of 2 meadow fescue cultivars. The levels of seed colonization of these species reached maximum 8 and 90%, respectively. No colonization by endophytes was found in seeds of red fescue. The viability of endophytic mycelium in the seeds of perennial ryegrass and meadow fescue was very low. Endophytic fungi were isolated only from 3 and 4 samples of these grasses respectively. In laboratory conditions, endophytic fungi showed stronger antagonistic properties at 25 C. The highest and most frequent growth inhibition was observed for M. nivale, Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium avenaceum and F. equiseti. The obligate pathogens B. graminis, P. coronata, and P. graminis ssp. graminicola were not sensitive to water and alcohol extracts of E+ seeds. Isolates Fp28, Fp40, and, to a lesser degree, Fp37, originating from meadow fescue, were characterized by the strongest antagonistic properties. Moreover, they did not produce (Fp28 and Fp37), or produced only small amounts (Fp40) of, ergovaline, which is toxic to animals. After additional tests, they could be used as biological factors for improving the utility value of new grass varieties and their resistance to stress factors.","Panka, D",ACTA SCIENTIARUM POLONORUM-HORTORUM CULTUS,2011,NA,0.917964527549125,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.915062908519758,0.0849370914802424,0.999030702416797,9.6929758320285e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

11782,Development and Optimization of Culture Medium for the Production of Glabridin by Aspergillus eucalypticola: An Endophytic Fungus Isolated from Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (Fabaceae),"Glabridin is a well-known active isoflavone found in the root of licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra L.) that possess a wide range of biological activity. Plant cells, hairy roots, and fungal endophytes cultures are the most important alternative methods for plant resources conservation and sustainable production of natural compounds, which has received much attention in recent decades. In the present study, an efficient culture condition was optimized for the biomass accumulation and glabridin production from fungal endophyte Aspergillus eucalypticola SBU-11AE isolated from licorice root. Type of culture medium, range of pH, and licorice root extract (as an elicitor) were tested. The results showed that the highest and lowest biomass production was observed on PCB medium (6.43 & PLUSMN; 0.32 g/l) and peptone malt (5.85 + 0.11 g/l), respectively. The medium culture PCB was produced the highest level of glabridin (7.26 & PLUSMN; 0.44 mg/l), while the lowest level (4.47 & PLUSMN; 0.02 mg/l) was obtained from the medium peptone malt. The highest biomass (8.51 & PLUSMN; 0.43 g/l) and glabridin (8.30 & PLUSMN; 0.51 mg/l) production were observed from the PCB medium adjusted with pH = 6, while the lowest value of both traits was obtained from the same medium with pH = 7. The highest production of total glabridin (10.85 & PLUSMN; 0.84 mg/l) was also obtained from the culture medium treated with 100 mg/l of the plant root extract. This information can be interestingly used for the commercialization of glabridin production for further industrial applications.","Ganjabadi, PB; Farzaneh, M; Mirjalili, MH",MYCOBIOLOGY,2023,10.1080/12298093.2023.2225253,0.846098306079209,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994340980875153,0.0056590191248473,0.999999942659596,5.73404042025771e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
17678,Bioaugmentation with copper tolerant endophyte Pseudomonas lurida strain EOO26 for improved plant growth and copper phytoremediation by Helianthus annuus.,"Organic fertilizers became a better alternative to chemical fertilizers in modern agricultural practices however, contamination of copper (Cu) from organic fertilizer is still a major concern for the globe. Plant growth promoting (PGP) microorganisms showed their efficiency to combat with this problem and thus Cu tolerant PGP endophytes from roots of Odontarrhena obovata (Alyssum obovatum) growing on Cu smelter contaminated serpentine soil were explored in present study. Out of twenty-four isolates, Pseudomonas lurida strain EOO26 identified by 16s rRNA gene sequencing was selected to check its efficacy for Cu-remediation. The strain EOO26 showed multi-metal tolerance, drought resistance and exhibited PGP attributes such as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase, siderophore and ammonia production. Significant production of indole-3-acetic acid and phosphate-solubilization under different Cu concentration (0-100 mg L-1) at varying pH (5.0-8.0) suggests potentiality of this strain to work effectively under wide range of abiotic stress conditions. Plant growth experiment (pH 6.8 ± 0.3) in copper spiked soil suggested a significant increase in length and dry weight of root and shoot of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) after inoculation with strain EOO26. Plants inoculated with strain EOO26 resulted in increase in Cu uptake by 8.6-fold for roots and 1.9-fold for leaves than uninoculated plants. The total plant uptake in inoculated Cu treatment was 2.6-fold higher than uninoculated one, which is much higher than the previously reported Cu accumulating plants. The excellent adaptation abilities and promising metal removal efficiency strongly indicate superiority of strain EOO26 for phytoremediation of Cu-contamination and may work effectively for Cu removal from contaminated soils.",Kumar A; Tripti NA; Voropaeva O; Maleva M; Panikovskaya K; Borisova G; Rajkumar M; Bruno LB,Chemosphere,2021,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128983,0.966977102423517,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.924945903257658,0.0750540967423419,0.999986097124509,1.39028754911896e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

(Mung bean) against Cercospora leaf spot disease.,"In the present work, Amycolatopsis sp. SND-1 (SND-1) was isolated from Cleome chellidonii Linn. (C. chellidonii) was performed as biocontrol and resistance elicitor in Vigna radiata (L.) R. Wilczek (mung bean) plants against Cercospora leaf spot causing pathogen Cercospora canescens (C. canescens). The SND-1 isolate showed 74% of inhibition against C. canescens in dual culture and GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of antifungal compounds. Molecular characterization through 16S rRNA showed that the isolated SND-1 belongs to Amycolatopsis sp. The in vitro plant growth trials exhibited production of indole acetic acid, gibberellic acid, cytokinin, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, and siderophore and phosphate solubilization. In vivo study with talcum formulation of SND-1 revealed a significant increase in plant root length, shoots length, root and shoot fresh weight, and reduced the disease severity in treated mung bean plants. Triggering of resistance by SND-1 formulation was studied by histochemical depositions and biochemical defense enzymes that resulted in the acceleration in defense response in comparison with control plants.

2938,Investigating the influence of antagonistic fungi Polydomus karssenii and Niesslia gamsii on the penetration of Heterodera filipjevi and Pratylenchus thornei in wheat,"Plant parasitic nematodes (PPNs) significantly impact global wheat production. Strategies for managing PPN include developing tolerance/resistance varieties, crop rotation, and the use of nematicides. However, nematicides are highly toxic and have a non-target effect on the soil biota, emphasizing the need for safer alternatives and innovative approaches. This study investigated the suppressive effect of two nematode egg parasitic fungi, Polydomus karssenii (Ashrafi et al., 2023) and Niesslia gamsii (Ashrafi and Maier, 2017), on the penetration of the cereal cyst nematode (CCN) Heterodera filipjevi (Madzhidov, 1981) and the root lesion nematode (RLN) Pratylenchus thornei (Sher and Allen, 1953) into wheat roots. Two nematode-susceptible wheat cultivars, Bezostaya and Seri, were treated with P. karssenii and N. gamsii. Germinated seeds were dipped in a fungal suspension before being inoculated with the nematode species. Nematode penetration was evaluated at 48 h, 72 h, and 1 week after inoculation using acid fuchsin staining and microscopical examination. The results revealed that both fungal treatments reduced nematode penetration in both cultivars compared to untreated controls, with P. karssenii showing higher overall effectiveness. Polydomus karssenii reduced penetration of H. filipjevi by 91.9% and P. thornei by 85.9%, while N. gamsii reduced penetration of H. filipjevi by 76% and P. thornei by 67.3%. Additionally, fungal treatments delayed nematode penetration, no penetration was observed at 48 h in treated plants, while nematode penetration was observed in untreated plants during the same period. This study underscores the potential of P. karssenii and N. gamsii as sustainable biological agents against nematodes and emphasizes their role in integrated pest management strategies for wheat production.","Atiya, O; Ashrafi, S; Dababat, AA; Maier, W; Toktay, H",RHIZOSPHERE,2025,10.1016/j.rhisph.2025.101045,0.883125762647337,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998598630834272,0.00140136916572838,0.999999995725348,4.2746516326630504e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16718,Characterization of molecular markers for specific and sensitive detection of Botrytis cinerea Pers.: Fr. in strawberry (Fragariaxananassa Duch.) using PCR.,"Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) assays were applied on 34 fungal strains isolated from strawberry and other host plants, in order to detect polymorphism to consequently identify and isolate molecular markers specific to Botrytis cinerea. Among the 26 10-mer primers tested, one primer mainly amplified a 750-bp product present in all the B. cinerea strains and absent in the other species and genera examined. This product was cloned and sequenced in order to design a specific 20-mer primer pair, which was tested on the 34 fungal isolates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A single 0.7-kb band was amplified in all the 13 strains of B. cinerea isolated from different host plants. Moreover, a 0.6-kb band was amplified in both Botrytis fabae strains. No band was observed for the nine other Botrytis species and 12 fungal genera isolated from strawberry plants. A comparison between the 0.7-kb B. cinerea sequence and the 0.6-kb B. fabae sequence revealed 98% homology and one 122-bp deletion for B. fabae, including an EcoRI site. Hybridization of Southern blots with RAPD and EcoRI-digested DNA confirmed the specificity of the marker. The limit of detection of B. cinerea genomic DNA was approximately 0.2 pg. The PCR procedure was able to amplify the 0.7-kb B. cinerea fragment form mixed samples of DNA as low as 2 pg B. cinerea genomic DNA and 1 microg plant DNA. Thus this PCR-based detection procedure is a powerful tool for diagnosis of B. cinerea in symptomless strawberry plants, and should allow infection and latency sites to be localized in order to improve knowledge of the epidemiology of the pathogen under field conditions.",Rigotti S; Gindro K; Richter H; Viret O,FEMS microbiology letters,2002,10.1111/j.1574-6968.2002.tb11127.x,0.913617897784337,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.904038678496099,0.0959613215039014,0.999999831193993,1.68806006728417e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The species belonging to these genera also perform a variety of diverse functions, including the remediation of environmental contaminations, beneficial phytohormone production, and maintaining their lifestyle as epiphytes, endophytes, and saprophytes. Recent research has revealed that despite their pathogenic nature, these fungi also play an intriguing role in agriculture. They act as phosphate solubilizers and produce phytohormones, such as indole acetic acid (IAA) and gibberellic acid (GAs), to accelerate the growth of various plants. Some species have also been reported to play a significant role in plant growth promotion during abiotic stresses, such as salinity stress, drought stress, heat stress, and heavy metal stress, as well as act as a biocontrol agent and a potential mycoherbicide.

465,"Signaling Effects of Nitric Oxide, Salicylic Acid, and Reactive Oxygen Species on Isoeuphpekinensin Accumulation in Euphorbia pekinensis Suspension Cells Induced by an Endophytic Fungal Elicitor","Nitric oxide (NO), salicylic acid (SA), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important signal molecules that mediate plant resistance reactions and play important roles in secondary metabolism. To research the signal transduction pathway of the endophytic fungal elicitor from Fusarium sp. E5 promoting secondary metabolism in Euphorbia pekinensis suspension cells, the changes in NO, SA, ROS, and isoeuphpekinensin contents in the cells were investigated after elicitor addition to the cell suspension culture. The elicitor did not change H2O2 or O-2 (-) contents notably, whereas NO and SA contents were enhanced. Both the NO donator sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and SA enhanced isoeuphpekinensin content in the absence of the fungal elicitor, whereas the NO scavenger cPTIO and SA biosynthesis inhibitor cinnamic acid (CA) inhibited isoeuphpekinensin accumulation in the presence of the elicitor. In addition, cPTIO inhibited SA production induced by the fungal elicitor. CA did not inhibit NO production, but it significantly inhibited isoeuphpekinensin accumulation. The results demonstrated that in Euphorbia pekinensis suspension cells the endophytic fungal elicitor induced increased NO content and SA production, which promoted isoeuphpekinensin accumulation. ROS are clearly not involved in the endophytic fungus-host interaction signaling pathway.","Gao, FK; Ren, CG; Dai, CC",JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION,2012,10.1007/s00344-012-9258-8,0.983451063444478,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999920735246138,7.92647538620091e-5,0.999999999994629,5.37081490392666e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

17178,First Report of Strawberry Dieback Caused by Lasiodiplodia theobromae.,"With a typical Mediterranean climate, Aydin is the third largest strawberry-producing province, responsible for 13% of the overall strawberry production in Turkey. Strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne) are mainly grown in raised, plastic-mulched beds under tunnels and soil solarization is the most effectively used management practice to control soil-borne pathogens. During October 2011 and 2012, 2 months after planting, wilting and collapse of plants were observed on commercial strawberry (cv. strawberry Festival) fields in Sultanhisar town of Aydin Province. Eleven percent of the plants were wilted and died. Symptomatic plants exhibited blackened necrotic discoloration of roots and in the cross section of crowns. A fungus was consistently isolated from pieces of infected tissue cut aseptically from the crowns and placed on potato dextrose agar. Fungus produced white colonies and later turned olivaecious black with dense aerial mycelium after 4 to 5 days incubation at 27°C. Dark brown to black pycnidia that formed on 20- to 30-day-old pure cultures under daylight conditions produced abundant conidia that were two-celled, thick-walled, and oval shaped with longitudinal striations. Single spore isolates from 12 samples were obtained and stored for further identification. The average size of 300 conidia was 25.42 ± 2.12 × 12.87 ± 1.08 μm. The morphology of the fungus was similar to Lasiodiplodia theobromae (Pat.) Griff. & Maubl. (syn. Botryodiplodia theobromae Pat.). To confirm the identity of the isolates, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA and the elongation factor 1-alpha gene were amplified with the universal ITS1/ITS4 and EF1-688F/EF1-1251R (1) primers, respectively. The amplicons from 12 isolates were commercially sequenced at Macrogen (Korea) and were deposited in GenBank under consecutive accession numbers KF910369 to KF910380 and KJ641536 to KJ641547. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis revealed that all 12 isolates were closely related and belonged to L. theobromae. Pathogenicity tests were performed by the toothpick technique (2) under greenhouse conditions (28°C, 14/10-h day/night, 70% RH) on potted strawberry plants (cv. strawberry Festival). Toothpicks carrying fungal growth taken from 1-week-old corn meal agar cultures of the tested isolates was placed into the basal crown tissue of the plants by piercing about 5 mm depth. Six plants were inoculated for each isolate and six were treated with sterile toothpick for control. All inoculated plants developed wilting and dieback symptoms resembling those of naturally infected plants within 2 to 3 weeks of incubation. All plants inoculated with the tested isolates collapsed after 4 weeks and showed discoloration of internal crown tissue. Control plants did not exhibit any disease symptoms, and crown tissue was symptomless. L. theobromae was successfully re-isolated from lesions of all inoculated plants. L. theobromae has been reported to cause cankers and dieback in a wide range of hosts in tropical and subtropical regions of the world (3). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of L. theobromae causing dieback on strawberry plants. References: (1) A. Alves et al. Fungal Divers. 28:1, 2008. (2) M. E. A. El-Morsi and I.

11314,Chlordecone Transfer and Distribution in Maize Shoots,"Chlordecone (CLD) is a persistent organic pollutant (POP) that was mainly used as an insecticide against banana weevils in the French West Indies (19721993). Transfer of CLD via the food chain is now the major mechanism for exposure of the population to CLD. The uptake and the transfer of CLD were investigated in shoots of maize, a C4 model plant growing under tropical climates, to estimate the exposure of livestock via feed. Maize plants were grown on soils contaminated with [14C]CLD under controlled conditions. The greatest part of the radioactivity was associated with roots, nearly 95%, but CLD was detected in whole shoots, concentrations in old leaves being higher than those in young ones. CLD was thus transferred from the base toward the plant top, forming an acropetal gradient of contaminant. In contrast, results evidenced the existence of a basipetal gradient of CLD concentration within leaves whose extremities accumulated larger amounts of CLD because of evapotranspiration localization. Extractable residues accounted for two-thirds of total residues both in roots and in shoots. This study highlighted the fact that the distribution of CLD contamination within grasses resulted from a conjunction between the age and evapotranspiration rate of tissues. CLD accumulation in fodder may be the main route of exposure for livestock.","Pascal-Lorber, S; Létondor, C; Liber, Y; Jamin, EL; Laurent, F",JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY,2016,10.1021/acs.jafc.5b05115,0.861476063644846,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.588890028698216,0.411109971301784,0.999995005364345,4.99463565517555e-6,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
9392,"Metabolomic profiling and cytotoxic potential of three endophytic fungi of the genera Aspergillus, Penicillium and Fusarium isolated from Nigella sativa seeds assisted with docking studies","The main aim of our study is to investigate the anticancer potential of our cultivated entophytic fungal strains from Nigella sativa seeds. The strains were identified by sequencing of the partial 18S rRNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region as Aspergillus sp. (SA4), Penicillium sp. (SA5), and Fusarium sp. (SA6). We carried out metabolic profiling for three fungal strains to investigate their metabolites diversity. Profiling of the different extracts revealed their richness in diverse metabolites and consequently fourteen compounds (1-14) were annotated. In addition, the obtained extracts were examined against three cell lines HepG2, MCF-7 and Caco-2 showed activity with IC50 values in the range of 1.95-39.7 mu g/mL. Finally, molecular docking study was performed showing questinol as the lowest glide binding score value (-5.925 kcal/mol) among all identified compounds. Our results showed Nigella sativa-associated endophytes as a promising source for further studies to look for anticancer secondary metabolites.","Shady, NH; Zhang, JY; Sobhy, SK; Hisham, M; Glaeser, SP; Alsenani, F; Kämpfer, P; El-Katatny, MH; Abdelmohsen, UR",NATURAL PRODUCT RESEARCH,2023,10.1080/14786419.2022.2136660,0.983911332035759,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993908774995047,0.00609122500495266,0.999997153262613,2.8467373874852e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
13129,Endophytic fungal diversity in tropical and subtropical plants,Endophytic fungi are an interesting group of microorganisms associated with the healthy tissues of plants. Endophytic fungal diversity is higher in tropical and subtropical plants than other climatic zones. Most of the reports available on bioactive product formation by endophytic fungi are also from tropical and subtropical climate.

14931,Potential Endophytic Fungi from the Leaves of Syzygium zeylanicum (L.) and Their Secondary Metabolite,"Endophytic fungi coexist without harms in the host in some parts or all parts of its lifecycle. Endophytic fungi excrete specialized bioactive compounds beneficial for of its host; the compound itself can be different from what can be found on their host. Endophytic fungi are capable to excrete biologically significant secondary metabolites acting as antidiabetic, antioxidant, antimicrobial, and cytostatic agents. Endophytic fungi existence are common across different plant s; including Syzygium zeylanicum that can be found in Indonesia. This study aims to isolate endophytic fungi found in leaves of S. zeylanicum, L., to elucidate their characterized morphologically, and to examine its antimicrobial and antioxidant properties in addition to their chemical structures. Characterization of endophytic fungi was conducted by their macroscopic and microscopic features, followed by molecular characterization of highly bioactive metabolites. Antimicrobial activities were measured by disc diffusion method. Antioxidant properties were measured with DPPH. Secondary metabolites were chromatographically isolated and identified with spectroscopy techniques (NMR ID and 2D). Four endophytic fungi isolates were obtained: Penicillium citrinum (SZ1), Colletotrichum lindemuthianum (SZ2), Aspergillus nidulan (SZ3), Scopulariopsis asperula (SZ4). P. citrinum (SZ1) showed antimicrobial activities against four different bacteria (71.3% against E. coli; 74.1% against S. aureus; 76.2% against S. typhi; and dan76.9% against B. subtilis). Antioxidant activity ini all ekstrak of endophytic fungi showed very activity (IC50 SZ3 extract = 3.85 µg/mL). Potential endophytic fungi SZ1 was molecularly identified as P. citrinum. Extracts from SZ1 fungi contains bioactive 4-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-ɣ-butyrolactone-3-yl) methyl acetate. The newly obtained substance could be developed into antimicrobial and antioxidant agents in further studies. © 2023, Universitas Jenderal Soedirman.

5494,Distribution of Plasmopara viticola Causing Downy Mildew in Russian Far East Grapevines,"Downy mildew is a severe disease that leads to significant losses in grape yields worldwide. It is caused by the oomycete Plasmopara viticola. The study of the distribution of this agent and the search for endophytic organisms that inhibit the growth of P. viticola are essential objectives to facilitate the transition to sustainable and high-yield agriculture, while respecting the environment. In this study, high-throughput sequencing of the ITS (ITS1f/ITS2 region) and 16S (V4 region) amplicons was employed to analyze 80 samples of leaves and stems from different grapevine species and cultivars grown in the Russian Far East (Vitis amurensis Rupr., Vitis coignetiae Pulliat, and several grapevine cultivars). The analysis revealed the presence of P. viticola in 53.75% of the grape samples. The pathogen P. viticola was not detected in V. amurensis samples collected near Vladivostok and Russky Island. Among the P. viticola-affected samples, only two (out of the eighty analyzed grape samples) from the Makarevich vineyard in Primorsky Krai exhibited disease symptoms, while the majority appeared visually healthy. We also found six distinct P. viticola ASVs in our metagenomic data. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we hypothesize that the P. viticola population in the Russian Far East may have originated from the invasive P. viticola clade aestivalis, which has spread around the world from North America. To identify putative microbial antagonists of P. viticola, a differential analysis of high-throughput sequencing data was conducted using the DESeq2 method to compare healthy and P. viticola-affected samples. The in silico analysis revealed an increased representation of certain taxa in healthy samples compared to P. viticola-affected ones: fungi-Kabatina sp., Aureobasidium sp., and Vishniacozyma sp.; bacteria-Hymenobacter spp., Sphingomonas spp., Massilia spp., Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum spp., and Chryseobacterium spp. This in-silico-obtained information on the potential microbial antagonists of P. viticola serves as a theoretical basis for the development of biocontrol agents for grapevine downy mildew.","Nityagovsky, NN; Ananev, AA; Suprun, AR; Ogneva, ZV; Dneprovskaya, AA; Tyunin, AP; Dubrovina, AS; Kiselev, KV; Sanina, NM; Aleynova, OA",HORTICULTURAE,2024,10.3390/horticulturae10040326,0.96606150294402,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995907148089969,0.00409285191003118,0.999999996145778,3.8542219416015705e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1637,Influence of Phenological Stage on Swainsonine and Endophyte Concentrations in Oxytropis sericea,"Locoweeds are defined as Astragalus and Oxytropis species that cause intoxication due to the alkaloid swainsonine. Swainsonine concentrations in Oxytropis sericea were influenced by location, plant part, and the developmental stage of the plant. Concentrations followed similar trends at each location, generally increasing over the growing season in above-ground parts until the plant reaches maturity with no change in concentration in the crowns. At the onset of senescence, swainsonine decreased in floral parts to less than half of the peak concentration. Similar to swainsonine concentrations, endophyte amounts were influenced by location, plant part, and the developmental stage of the plant. Likewise, endophyte amounts generally increased over the growing season in above ground parts and remained static in the crowns at all four locations. Swainsonine in Oxytropis sericea was positively associated with the endophyte Undifilum, which is responsible for swainsonine biosynthesis.","Cook, D; Shi, L; Gardner, DR; Pfister, JA; Grum, D; Welch, KD; Ralphs, MH",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,2012,10.1007/s10886-012-0067-0,0.987633745510663,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99045634871609,0.00954365128390981,0.999999997779195,2.2208046512872703e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
14114,Effects of Epichlo endophytes of Achnatherum sibiricum on spore germination of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; [感染羽茅的香柱菌属内生真菌对丛枝菌根真菌孢子萌发的影响],"Endophytic fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are important components of grassland ecosystem. Endophytes can reduce colonization rates of their host plants by AM fungi. In this study, Achnatherum sibiricum, infected by Epichlo sibiricum (Es) or E. gansuensis (Eg), was adopted as experimental material. The effect of Epichlo endophyte culture filtrate, root exudates and aqueous extracts from the leaves (including fresh and dead leaves) on the spore germination rates of AM fungi (Glomus mosseae and Glomus etunicatum) were evaluated. The results showed that culture filtration of Epichlo endophyte significantly inhibited the germination rate of AM fungi spores. Root exudates of infected plants only significantly inhibited the germination of G. etunicatum spores, and such effect was not related to the endophytic species. The leaf aqueous extracts had no significant effect on the germination rate of G. mosseae spores. Only the aqueous extract of Es-infected dead leaves significantly reduced the spore germination rate of G. etunicatum. In natural ecosystem, Epichlo endophytes are normally internally hosted in plants, which may affect the spore germination of AM fungi by affecting the root exudates of the host plants. © 2018, Science Press.

6018,Endophytic fungi associated with leaves of Betulaceae in Japan,"Diversity and species composition of endophytic fungi on leaves of 11 tree species in Betulaceae were studied, with reference to climatic, tree species, and seasonal variations. A total of 186 fungal isolates were obtained from 190 leaves collected in a subalpine forest, a cool temperate forest, and a subtropical forest in Japan, and were divided into 46 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) according to the base sequences of D1-D2 region of large subunit rDNA. The 2 most frequent OTUs were Muscodor sp. and Nemania sp. in Xylariaceae, followed by Gnomonia sp., Glomerella acutata, Apiosporopsis sp., Asteroma sp., and Cladosporium cladosporioides. The similarities of OTU composition in endophytic fungal assemblages on leaves of Betulaceae were generally low among the forests of different climatic regions. Fungal OTU compositions were relatively similar between 2 Betula species in the subalpine forest, whereas 7 tree species in the cool temperate forest were divided into 3 groups according to the similarity of endophytic fungal assemblages on the leaves, with 4 Carpinus species assigned into 2 of the 3 groups. The similarity of endophytic fungal assemblages between August and October was relatively high in the subalpine forest, whereas the seasonal changes were generally greater (i.e., the similarities among sampling dates were lower) in the cool temperate forest.","Osono, T; Masuya, H",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY,2012,10.1139/W2012-018,0.87376573589893,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997230065512094,0.00276993448790552,0.999999363435361,6.36564638778481e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3489,Exploring soil bacterial and fungal communities in Colombian terrestrial ecosystems modulated by altitude-influenced factors,"A bacterial (16S rRNA) and fungal (ITS rRNA) taxonomic characterization was carried out using metabarcoding along an altitudinal gradient in the western range of the Valle del Cauca, Colombia. This study encompassed Tropical Dry Forests, Andean, and Paramo ecosystems in Laguna de Sonso (900 m.a.s.l), Yotoco (1,800 m.a.s.l), Bosque del Duende (2,400 m.a.s.l), and Paramo del Duende (3,200 m.a.s.l). The physicochemical analyses revealed soils with high organic matter (>10%), non-compacted, extremely acidic pH levels (4.4) at higher altitudes, and slightly to moderately acidic pH in lower areas (5.5-6.1). 59 plant families were identified, with Araceae, Lauraceae, and Fabaceae being the most abundant. The most abundant bacterial taxonomic assignments were Acidobacteriota and Proteobacteria phyla, while for fungi, it was Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Alpha diversity analysis showed high community diversity, whereas beta diversity reflected composition differences among locations and their heterogeneity. The most abundant functional predictions for bacteria were chemoheterotrophic activity and nitrogen cycle involvement. At the same time, for fungi, it was ecological guilds related to pathogenic activity in both animals and plants, endophytes, and epiphytic saprotrophs.

15728,"Runoff nutrient losses from tall fescue pastures varying in endophyte association, fertilization, and harvest management","Tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum [Schreb.] S.J.Darbysh.) is a widely adopted cool-season perennial forage in the southeastern United States. Historically, tall fescue contained a symbiotic fungal endophyte, Epichloë coenophiala, that produced an ergot alkaloid toxic to livestock. New fescue biotypes have been developed that are endophyte free or include endophytes that produce low-toxicity alkaloids. Ecological implications of these biotypes are not fully understood.We evaluated nutrient runoff quality for three tall fescue biotypes (common, high alkaloid endophyte [wild]; low alkaloid endophyte [novel]; and endophyte free [free]) under two fertilizer sources (broiler litter [BL] and inorganic fertilizer) in grazed systems and a hayed system with inorganic fertilization of endophyte free fescue. The seven treatments were replicated twice on 1 ha paddocks near Watkinsville, Georgia. Grazed paddocks were stocked in September each year with weaned Angus (Bos taurus) heifers (2002 to 2007) and steers (2008 to 2009) at rates of ~3 to 6 head paddock–1 adjusted every 28 days to maintain 1 to 3 Mg ha–1 of available forage.Weather conditions varied from very dry to very wet and allowed 15 grazing periods (50 to 198 days). Tall fescue with novel-endophyte association had lower or equal runoff concentrations and loads for inorganic nitrogen (N), total N (TN), ortho-phosphorus (ortho-P), and total P (TP) than fescue with wild- or free-endophyte association (fescue treatment mean concentrations [mg L–1]: <0.8 inorganic N, <4.0 TN, <3.5 ortho-P and TP; mean loads [kg ha–1]: <0.08 inorganic N, <0.40 TN, <0.30 ortho-P and TP; all original untransformed data).This indicates increased adoption of novel-endophyte fescue, as previously recommended, presents no additional risk for nutrient losses regardless of fertilization source.Weather variability had impact on assessed variables. Mean total runoff across all paddocks during above average (27.2%) and average (20.6%) monthly rainfall periods were 15.2- and 1.9-fold greater than that from the below average (52.2%) monthly rainfall period. Nutrient loads also were greater: 3.4-fold (TP) to 14.6-fold (ammonium-N). Pollutant loads in the upper quartile were several fold greater than those from the rest of the data.The presence of cattle increased ortho-P load up to 3-fold compared with periods with no cattle. © 2021 Soil Conservation Society of America.

10639,"New endophytic Toxicocladosporium species from cacti in Brazil, and description of Neocladosporium gen. nov.","Brazil harbours a unique ecosystem, the Caatinga, which belongs to the tropical dry forest biome. This region has an important diversity of organisms, and recently several new fungal species have been described from different hosts and substrates within it. During a survey of fungal endophyte diversity from cacti in this forest, we isolated cladosporium- like fungi that were subjected to morphological and multigene phylogenetic analyses including actA, ITS, LSU, rpb2 and tub2 gene sequences. Based on these analyses we identified two new species belonging to the genus Toxicocladosporium, described here as T. cacti and T. immaculatum spp. nov., isolated from Pilosocereus gounellei subsp. gounellei and Melocactus zehntneri, respectively. To improve the species recognition and assess species diversity in Toxicocladosporium we studied all ex-type strains of the genus, for which actA, rpb2 and tub2 barcodes were also generated. After phylogenetic reconstruction using five loci, we differentiated 13 species in the genus. Toxicocladosporium velox and T. chlamydosporum are synonymized based on their phylogenetic position and limited number of unique nucleotide differences. Six strains previously assigned to T. leucadendri, including the ex-type strain (CBS 131317) of that species, were found to belong to an undescribed genus here named as Neocladosporium gen. nov., with N. leucadendri comb. nov. as type species.

4688,Selenium species transforming along soil-plant continuum and their beneficial roles for horticultural crops,"Selenium (Se) acquirement from daily diet can help reduce the risk of many diseases. The edible parts of crop plants are the main source of dietary Se, while the Se content in crops is determined by Se bioavailability in soil. We summarize recent research on the biogeochemical cycle of Se driven by specific microorganisms and emphasize the oxidizing process in the Se cycle. Moreover, we discuss how plant root exudates and rhizosphere microorganisms affect soil Se availability. Finally, we cover beneficial microorganisms, including endophytes, that promote crop quality and improve crop tolerance to environmental stresses. Se availability to plants depends on the balance between adsorption and desorption, reduction, methylation and oxidation, which are determined by interactions among soil properties, microbial communities and plants. Reduction and methylation processes governed by bacteria or fungi lead to declined Se availability, while Se oxidation regulated by Se-oxidizing microorganisms increases Se availability to plants. Despite a much lower rate of Se oxidization compared to reduction and methylation, the potential roles of microbial communities in increasing Se bioavailability are probably largely underestimated. Enhancing Se oxidation and Se desorption are crucial for the promotion of Se bioavailability and uptake, particularly in Se-deficient soils. Beneficial roles of Se are reported in terms of improved crop growth and quality, and enhanced protection against fungal diseases and abiotic stress through improved photosynthetic traits, increased sugar and amino acid contents, and promoted defense systems. Understanding Se transformation along the plant-soil continuum is crucial for agricultural production and even for human health.","Guo, QX; Ye, JH; Zeng, JM; Chen, L; Korpelainen, H; Li, CY",HORTICULTURE RESEARCH,2023,10.1093/hr/uhac270,0.609752373976185,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.968464411021104,0.0315355889788961,0.989305739027651,0.0106942609723487,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
12832,Patch burning tall fescue invaded grasslands alters alkaloids and tiller defoliation with implications for cattle toxicosis,"Tall fescue (Schedonurus arundinaceus), an exotic invasive grass in North America, can associate with a fungal endophyte that causes livestock toxicity. Native prairies are frequently managed with interactive fire and grazing, yet little is known regarding tall fescue's endophytic and toxicological responses. From 2012 to 2014, we applied patch-burn grazing (PBG-burning a different third annually) or graze and burn (GAB-burning completely in 2012 but no fire in 2013 or 2014) treatments to tall fescue-invaded grasslands. Burning happened in March/April, and cattle grazing occurred during the growing season. Tall fescue tillers were analyzed for Epichloe endophyte presence and alkaloid concentrations (ergovaline, ergovalinine, N-acetylnorloline, N-formylloline, N-acetylloline). Cattle toxicosis was assessed via fecal ergovaline levels. With PBG, tiller defoliation was greater in burned patches versus unburned and was greater than any years in GAB. In GAB, tiller defoliation was no different the year of the burn than the years without fire. Cattle did not discriminate between endophyte-infected or endophyte-free tillers in either treatment. Endophyte infection levels were inversely related to years since fire (YSF), and various alkaloids displayed asynchronous responses to YSF. Cattle had no detectable fecal ergovaline when managed with patchy or complete pasture fires. Only two herds had detectable fecal ergovaline (> 100 ppb), which were in pastures managed without fire and only in 2013. Thus, patch burning tall fescue-invaded grasslands alters alkaloids and tiller defoliation with implications for cattle toxicosis. Future research should incorporate greater intra-annual resolution of plant phenology relative to focal grazing and alkaloid expression. (C) 2021 The Society for Range Management.

11059,Strong in vitro antagonism by elm xylem endophytes is not accompanied by temporally stable in planta protection against a vascular pathogen under field conditions,"Some endophytic fungi provide their host plants with protection against abiotic and biotic stressors, including pathogens. Endophyte-mediated mechanisms might be behind the environmental resistance shown in the field by some adult Ulmus minor trees to the Dutch elm disease (DED) pathogen, Ophiostoma novo-ulmi. We isolated and characterized seven endophyte fungi from the xylem of three adult U. minor trees that have survived the DED epidemics within areas in Spain ravaged by the disease. The antagonism of the isolated endophytes towards O. novo-ulmi was evaluated in vitro by means of dual culture assays. Six of the studied endophytes hindered the pathogen growth through antibiosis, competition for the substrate, or a combination of both mechanisms. Four of these endophytes were selected for in vivo tests where their protective effect was evaluated in field experiments during three successive years (2011-2013). The conditioning inoculation of two endophytes (Monographella nivalis and Alternaria tennuissima) reduced DED symptoms in 2011 and 2012, respectively. However, the same isolates did not show any prophylactic effect in 2013, which suggests that the repeatability of the treatments is low. A significant treatment x clone interaction was found, showing that the effectiveness of the treatments depended on the tree clone. The future use of endophytes in biocontrol strategies might be oriented towards taking into consideration the whole fungal microbiome in forest breeding programs rather than the external application of particular endophyte strains.","Martín, JA; Macaya-Sanz, D; Witzell, J; Blumenstein, K; Gil, L",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY,2015,10.1007/s10658-015-0602-2,0.92447040670049,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990614035278703,0.00938596472129702,0.99997554893126,2.44510687398281e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19167,Untargeted metabolomics reveals PTI-associated metabolites.,"Plants employ a multilayered immune system to combat pathogens. In one layer, recognition of Pathogen- or Microbe-Associated Molecular Patterns or elicitors, triggers a cascade that leads to defence against the pathogen and Pattern Triggered Immunity. Secondary or specialised metabolites (SMs) are expected to play a role, because they are potentially anti-fungal compounds. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants inoculated with Alternaria solani s.l. show symptoms of infection after inoculation. Plants inoculated with Alternaria alternata remain symptomless. We hypothesised that pattern-triggered induction of resistance related metabolites in tomato contributes to the resistance against A. alternata. We compared the metabolomic profile (metabolome) of tomato after treatments with A. alternata, A. solani and the fungal elicitor chitin, and identified SMs involved in early defence of tomato plants. We revealed differential metabolome fingerprints. The composition of A. alternata and chitin induced metabolomes show larger overlap with each other than with the A. solani induced metabolome. We identify 65 metabolites possibly associated with PTI in tomato plants, including NAD and trigonelline. We confirm that trigonelline inhibits fungal growth in vitro at physiological concentrations.

11982,Prevalence of interspecific hybrids amongst asexual fungal endophytes of grasses,"Epichloe endophytes are fungal symbionts of grasses that span a continuum including asexual mutualists that are vertically transmitted, obligately sexual pathogens that are horizontally transmitted, and mixed-strategy symbionts with both mutualistic and pathogenic capabilities. Here we show that processes of genome evolution differ markedly for the different symbiont types. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis was conducted of a broad taxonomic, ecological and geographical sample of sexual and asexual isolates, in which were identified and sequenced alleles of genes for beta-tubulin (tub2) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1), and microsatellite alleles were identified by length polymorphisms. The majority of asexual isolates had two or three alleles of most loci, but every sexual isolate had only single alleles for each locus. Phylogenetic analysis of tub2 and tef1 indicated that in all instances of multiple alleles in an isolate, the alleles were derived from different sexual species. It is concluded that, whereas horizontally transmissible species had haploid genomes and speciation occurred cladistically, most of the strictly seedborne mutualists were interspecific hybrids with heteroploid (aneuploid or polyploid) genomes. Furthermore, the phylogenetic evidence indicated that, in at least some instances, hybridization followed rather than caused evolution of the strictly seedborne habit. Therefore, the abundance of hybrid species among grass endophytes, and their prevalence in many host populations suggests a selective advantage of hybridization for the mutualistic endophytes.","Moon, CD; Craven, KD; Leuchtmann, A; Clement, SL; Schardl, CL",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2004,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02138.x,0.961292281311215,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.778298679052768,0.221701320947232,0.999999979148595,2.08514054911291e-8,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
6599,"Isolation, identification, and ecology of growth and taxol production by an endophytic strain of Paraconiothyrium variabile from English yew trees (Taxus baccata)","Endophytic fungi were isolated/screened from temperate Taxus baccata (Yew) for production of the anti-cancer drug taxol. Of 242 endophytic fungi isolated from surface-sterilised Yew tree twig segments, only two produced taxol in a defined liquid medium; confirmed by HPLC and LC-MS/MS analyses. They were identified by molecular means by sequencing of ITS1/ITS2 regions and shown to be Paraconiothyrium variabile and Epicoccum nigrum. They produced 1.75 and 1.32 mu gL(-1) taxol respectively in a defined medium. Studies focussed on the P. variabile strain as it produced higher taxol amounts. Solute type (NaCl, KCl, Glucose, Glycerol, sorbitol), temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees C) and water availability (water activity, a(w); 0.90-0.99) on growth and taxol production by P. variabile was determined. Growth was similar on media with different solutes (1.0-1.25 mm d(-1)), optimum at 0.99 a, and 25 C. In contrast, optimum taxol production was in a defined medium modified with KCl, at 0.98 a(w) and 20/25 degrees C, with approx. 2.3 and 7 mu gL(-1) respectively. No taxol was produced at <0.96 a(w), at 25-30 degrees C, and <0.94 a(w) at 20 degrees C. This suggests that taxol producing endophytic fungi are in English yew trees and may have potential for utilisation as cell factories for production of this pharmaceutically useful compound.

With this view, we developed three novel nanoconjugates using microbial natural pigment for effective application against certain pathogenic microbes. A natural red pigment (RP) extracted from the endophyte Monascus ruber and gamma rays were applied to synthesize RP-ZnO, RP-CuO, and RP-MgO nanoconjugates. The synthesized nanoconjugates were characterized by different techniques to study their properties. The antimicrobial potential of these nanoconjugates was evaluated. Moreover, the antibiofilm, protein leakage, growth curve, and UV light irradiation effect of the synthesized nanoconjugates were also studied. Our results confirmed the nano-size, shape, and stability of the prepared conjugates. RP-ZnO, RP-CuO, and RP-MgO nanoconjugates showed broad antimicrobial potential against the tested bacterial and fungal pathogens. Furthermore, the RP-ZnO nanoconjugate possessed the highest activity, followed by the RP-CuO against the tested microbes. The highest % inhibition of biofilm formation by the RP-ZnO nanoconjugate. Membrane leakage of E. coli and S. aureus by RP-ZnO nanoconjugate was more effective than RP-MgO and RP-CuO nanoconjugates.

5530,An overview of the systematics of the Sordariomycetes based on a four-gene phylogeny,"The Sordariomycetes is one of the largest classes in the Ascomycota, and the majority of its species are characterized by perithecial ascomata and inoperculate unitunicate asci. It includes more than 600 genera with over 3000 species and represents a wide range of ecologies including pathogens and endophytes of plants, animal pathogens and mycoparasites. To test and refine the classification of the Sordariomycetes sensu Eriksson (2006), the phylogenetic relationship among 106 taxa from 12 orders out of 16 in the Sordariomycetes was investigated based on four nuclear loci (nSSU and nLSU rDNA, TEE and RPB2), using three species of the Leotiomycetes as outgroups. Three subclasses (i.e. Hypocreomycetidae, Sordariomycetidae and Xylariomycetidae) currently recognized in the classification are well supported with the placement of the Lulworthiales in either a basal group of the Sordariomycetes or a sister group of the Hypocreomycetidae. Except for the Microascales, our results recognize most of the orders as monophyletic groups. Melanospora species form a clade outside of the Hypocreales and are recognized as a distinct order in the Hypocreomycetidae. Glomerellaceae is excluded from the Phyllachorales and placed in Hypocreomycetidae incertae sedis. In the Sordariomycetidae, the Sordariales is a strongly supported clade and occurs within a well supported clade containing the Boliniales and Chaetosphaeriales. Aspects of morphology, ecology and evolution are discussed.","Zhang, N; Castlebury, LA; Miller, AN; Huhndorf, SM; Schoch, CL; Seifert, KA; Rossman, AY; Rogers, JD; Kohlmeyer, J; Volkmann-Kohlmeyer, B; Sung, GH",MYCOLOGIA,2006,10.3852/mycologia.98.6.1076,0.906823547791991,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.652478250715917,0.347521749284083,0.999999984928831,1.50711685353855e-8,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
3569,"A New Proposed Symbiotic Plant-Herbivore Relationship between Burkea africana Trees, Cirina forda Caterpillars and Their Associated Fungi Pleurostomophora richardsiae and Aspergillus nomius","Burkea africana is a tree found in savannah and woodland in southern Africa, as well as northwards into tropical African regions as far as Nigeria and Ethiopia. It is used as fuel wood, medicinally to treat various conditions, such as toothache, headache, migraine, pain, inflammation, and sexually transmitted diseases, such as gonorrhoea, but also an ornamental tree. The current study investigated the possible symbiotic relationship between B. africana trees and the C. forda caterpillars and the mutual role played in ensuring the survival of B. africana trees/seedlings in harsh natural conditions and low-nutrient soils. Deoxyribonucleic acid isolation and sequencing results revealed that the fungal species Pleurostomophora richardsiae was highly predominant in the leaves of B. africana trees and present in the caterpillars. The second most prominent fungal species in the caterpillars was Aspergillus nomius. The latter is known to be related to a Penicillium sp. which was found to be highly prevalent in the soil where B. africana trees grow and is suggested to play a role in enhancing the effective growth of B. africana trees in their natural habitat. To support this, a phylogenetic analysis was conducted, and a tree was constructed, which shows a high percentage similarity between Aspergillus and Penicillium sp. The findings of the study revealed that B. africana trees not only serve as a source of feed for the C. forda caterpillar but benefit from C. forda caterpillars which, after dropping onto the soil, is proposed to inoculate the soil surrounding the trees with the fungus A. nomius which suggests a symbiotic and/or synergistic relationship between B. africana trees and C. forda caterpillars.","Nemadodzi, LE; Prinsloo, G",MICROORGANISMS,2023,10.3390/microorganisms11071864,0.952383027386282,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999704908302225,2.9509169777538e-4,0.999999900020371,9.99796285761079e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6523,Genomic and Metabolomic Analysis of the Endophytic Fungus Fusarium sp.

In this study, an endophytic fungus designated Fusarium sp. VM-40 was isolated from a healthy specimen of the traditional European medicinal plant Vinca minor. Our morphological characterization and phylogenetic analysis reveal that Fusarium sp. VM-40 is closely related to Fusarium paeoniae, belonging to the F. tricinctum species complex (FTSC), the genomic architecture and secondary metabolite profile of which have not been investigated. Thus, we sequenced the whole genome of Fusarium sp. VM-40 with the new Oxford Nanopore R10.4 flowcells. The assembled genome is 40 Mb in size with a GC content of 47.72%, 15 contigs (>= 50,000 bp; N 50 similar to 4.3 Mb), and 13,546 protein-coding genes, 691 of which are carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme)-encoding genes. We furthermore predicted a total of 56 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) with antiSMASH, 25 of which showed similarity with known BGCs. In addition, we explored the potential of this fungus to produce secondary metabolites through untargeted metabolomics. Our analyses reveal that this fungus produces structurally diverse secondary metabolites of potential pharmacological relevance (alkaloids, peptides, amides, terpenoids, and quinones). We also employed an epigenetic manipulation method to activate cryptic BGCs, which led to an increased abundance of several known compounds and the identification of several putative new compounds. Taken together, this study provides systematic research on the whole genome sequence, biosynthetic potential, and metabolome of the endophytic fungus Fusarium sp.

A clear hierarchical filtration of microbiota by plants was observed in the four rhizocompartments - the nodule endosphere, root endosphere, rhizosphere and root zone - as demonstrated by significant variations in the composition of the microbial community in the different compartments. The rhizosphere and root zone microbial communities were largely influenced by soil type, and the nodule and root endophytes were primarily determined by plant species. Diverse microbes inhabited the root nodule endosphere, and the corresponding dominant symbiotic rhizobia belonged to Ensifer for alfalfa and Ensifer-Bradyrhizobium for soya bean. The nonsymbiotic nodule endophytes were mainly Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The variation in root microbial communities was also affected by the plant growth stage.

18689,Genome-wide expression analysis of Festuca sinensis symbiotic with endophyte of reveals key candidate genes in response to nitrogen starvation.,"Nitrogen is one of the essential macronutrients bulk elements affecting plant growth and yield. However, the nitrogen content in most agricultural soils today is insufficient to meet the increasing demand for crop productivity. Festuca sinensis is an important cultivated forage grass found in high-altitude regions of China. Breeding forage varieties capable of maintaining high yields under nitrogen-deficient conditions is of great significance. Despite its ecological and agricultural importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying the response of Festuca sinensis to nitrogen starvation, as well as the identification of key regulatory genes, remain largely unexplored. In this study, Festuca sinensis was cultured under different nitrogen concentrations using 1/2 Hoagland nutrient solution. Significant morphological differences were observed among the treatments, and physiological experiments confirmed that Festuca sinensis experienced substantial stress under low-nitrogen conditions. Subsequently, RNA-Seq analysis was conducted with four treatment groups and two plant tissue types. We focused on the Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways enriched with Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) in three aspects: (1) the nitrogen starvation response of Festuca sinensis, (2) the symbiosis between Festuca sinensis and Epichloë sinensis, and (3) the response to nitrogen starvation after symbiosis. Through this analysis, we screened five key genes (FsNRT2.2, FsNRT2.4, FsC/VIF2, FsIRT1, and FsYSL15) as potentially important regulators. Additionally, protein interaction network analysis revealed several core genes that may play crucial roles in nitrogen starvation response and provide insights for breeding new Festuca sinensis germplasm with enhanced nitrogen deficiency tolerance. This study is the first to screen core genes in Festuca sinensis related to its response to nitrogen starvation, its symbiosis with Epichloë sinensis, and the symbiotic response to nitrogen-deficient conditions. the key genes identified along with their enriched pathways, provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying nitrogen starvation tolerance. These genes can be utilized to develop new Epichloë sinensis germplasm with enhanced tolerance to nitrogen deficiency and may also serve as a reference for advancing nitrogen starvation research in other plant species.",Geng J; Zhang M; Hu J; Bilal M; Yang J; Hu T,BMC plant biology,2025,10.1186/s12870-025-06817-y,0.929829218234998,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.981084379244177,0.0189156207558227,0.999708242372913,2.9175762708655e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16418,Influence of seagrass traits on the diversity of endophytic fungi,"Kinamot VB. 2024. Influence of seagrass traits on the diversity of endophytic fungi. Biodiversitas 25: 1254-1263. The interest in endophytic fungi has grown recently because of their potential to enhance plant growth, tolerate stresses, and modulate phytohormone synthesis. Understanding how plants influence their endophytic fungal assemblage is vital to manipulating them for biotechnological applications. In this study, Bray-Curtis analysis determined the variation of endophytic fungal assemblage among different seagrass species. Leaf/root area, leaf/root dry matter content, leaf mass per area, leaf toughness, and specific leaf area of seagrasses were measured using a standard protocol. The Folin-Ciocalteau method was utilized to quantify the phenolic and tannin contents in seagrasses using tannic acid as standard. Canonical correspondence analysis correlated the influence of seagrass traits on endophytic fungal diversity. Results showed that endophytic fungal diversity varied with seagrass hosts in which higher similarity of the fungal assemblage was observed among the same seagrass species than in different seagrass species. The seagrass traits mediated the variation of endophytic fungi. Phenolic and tannin in seagrasses significantly influenced the diversity of endophytic fungi. An antifungal assay using the methanolic crude extract of seagrasses had 80-100% mycelial growth inhibition to the five species of endophytic fungi tested, which could be accounted for the chemicals like phenol and tannin that the seagrass hosts produce. © 2024, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

4673,Assessing the Biocontrol Potential of Clonostachys Species Isolated as Endophytes from Coffea Species and as Mycoparasites of Hemileia Rusts of Coffee in Africa,"During surveys conducted in South America and Africa to identify natural fungal enemies of coffee leaf rust (CLR), Hemileia vastatrix, over 1500 strains were isolated, either as endophytes from healthy tissues of Coffea species or as mycoparasites growing on rust pustules. Based on morphological data, eight isolates-three isolated from wild or semiwild coffee and five from Hemileia species on coffee, all from Africa-were provisionally assigned to the genus Clonostachys. A polyphasic study of their morphological, cultural and molecular characteristics-including the Tef1 (translation elongation factor 1 alpha), RPB1 (largest subunit of RNA polymerase II), TUB (beta-tubulin) and ACL1 (ATP citrate lyase) regions-confirmed these isolates as belonging to three species of the genus Clonostachys: namely C. byssicola, C. rhizophaga and C. rosea f. rosea. Preliminary assays were also conducted to test the potential of the Clonostachys isolates to reduce CLR severity on coffee under greenhouse conditions. Foliar and soil applications indicated that seven of the isolates had a significant effect (p < 0.05) in reducing CLR severity. In parallel, in vitro tests that involved conidia suspensions of each of the isolates together with urediniospores of H. vastatrix resulted in high levels of inhibition of urediniospore germination. All eight isolates showed their ability to establish as endophytes in C. arabica during this study, and some proved to be mycoparasites of H. vastatrix. In addition to reporting the first records of Clonostachys associated with healthy coffee tissues and with Hemileia rusts of coffee, this work provides the first evidence that Clonostachys isolates have potential as biological control agents against CLR.","Kapeua-Ndacnou, M; de Abreu, LM; de Macedo, DM; da Nóbrega, TF; Pereira, CM; Evans, HC; Barreto, RW",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2023,10.3390/jof9020248,0.979696549851289,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996631045360245,0.00336895463975509,0.999999905606369,9.43936306896376e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10180,Facultative root-colonizing fungi dominate endophytic assemblages in roots of nonmycorrhizal Microthlaspi species,"There is increasing knowledge on the diversity of root-endophytic fungi, but limited information on their lifestyles and dependence on hosts hampers our understanding of their ecological functions. We compared diversity and biogeographical patterns of cultivable and noncultivable root endophytes to assess whether their occurrence is determined by distinct ecological factors. The endophytic diversity in roots of nonmycorrhizal Microthlaspi spp. growing across Europe was assessed using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and compared with a previous dataset based on cultivation of endophytes from the same root samples. HTS revealed a large fungal richness undetected by cultivation, but which largely comprised taxa with restricted distributions and/or low representation of sequence reads. Both datasets coincided in a consistent high representation of widespread endophytes within orders Pleosporales, Hypocreales and Helotiales, as well as similar associations of community structure with spatial and environmental conditions. Likewise, distributions of particular endophytes inferred by HTS agreed with cultivation data in suggesting individual ecological preferences. Our findings support that Microthlaspi spp. roots are colonized mostly by saprotrophic and likely facultative endophytes, and that differential niche preferences and distribution ranges among fungi importantly drive the assembly of root-endophytic communities.","Glynou, K; Nam, B; Thines, M; Maciá-Vicente, JG",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,2018,10.1111/nph.14873,0.920567202760906,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.965508944175435,0.0344910558245649,0.999999845145034,1.54854966183393e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
9899,The endophytic fungus Trametes hirsuta as a novel alternative source of podophyllotoxin and related aryl tetralin lignans,"The aryl tetralin lignans are synthesized by Podophyllum sps. and are in great demand worldwide due to their use in synthesis of topoisomerase inhibitors. However, the sustained production of these aryl tetralin lignans requires large-scale harvesting from the natural environments, which has resulted in the plant-endangered status. In view of the difficulties in their total chemical synthesis, cultivation and failure of metabolic engineering approaches, there is a need to search for alternative sources of production of aryl tetralin lignans. We unequivocally established the methodology for isolation, identification, and characterization of a novel fungal endophyte (Trametes hirsuta) that produces aryl tetralin lignans consistently as shown by HPLC, LC-MS, LC/MS-MS and H-1 NMR. The lignans produced by the microorganism are biologically active, and exhibit potent antioxidant, anticancer and radioprotective properties. This strategy promises to improve the production of these therapeutically important compounds at lower costs. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

1096,"Activity of Scottish Plant, Lichen and Fungal Endophyte Extracts against Mycobacterium aurum and Mycobacterium tuberculosis","With tuberculosis the leading bacterial killer worldwide and other mycobacterial diseases on the increase, the search for new antimycobacterial agents is timely. In this study, extracts from plants, lichens and fungal endophytes of Scottish provenance were screened for activity against Mycobacterium aurum and M. tuberculosis H(37)Rv. The best activity against M. aurum was observed for extracts of Juniperus communis roots and Cladonia arbuscula (MIC = 4 mu g/mL), and a fungal endophyte isolated from Vaccinium myrtillus (MIC = 8 mu g/mL). The best activity against M. tuberculosis was observed for extracts of C. arbuscula, Empetrum nigrum,J. communis roots, Calluna vulgaris aerial parts, Myrica gale roots and stems (93 to 99% inhibition at 100 mu g/mL). Potent antitubercular activity (90 to 96% inhibition at 100 mu g/mL) was also observed for the ethanol extracts of Xerocomus badius, Chalciporus piperatus, Suillus luteus and of endophytes isolated from C. vulgaris, E. nigrum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea and V myrtillus. The results obtained this study provide, in part, some scientific basis for the traditional use of some of the selected plants in the treatment of tuberculosis.

12899,Are common symbiosis genes required for endophytic rice-rhizobial interactions?,"Legume plants are able to establish root nodule symbioses with nitrogen-fixing bacteria, called rhizobia. Recent studies revealed that the root nodule symbiosis has co-opted the signaling pathway that mediates the ancestral mycorrhizal symbiosis that occurs in most land plants. Despite being unable to induce nodulation, rhizobia have been shown to be able to infect and colonize the roots of non-legumes such as rice. One fascinating question is whether establishment of such associations requires the common symbiosis (Sym) genes that are essential for infection of plant cells by mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia in legumes. Here, we demonstrated that the common Sym genes are not required for endophytic colonization of rice roots by nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. © 2013 Landes Bioscience.",Chen C.; Zhu H.,Plant Signaling and Behavior,2013,10.4161/psb.25453,0.874691664241961,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.815592375317542,0.184407624682457,0.999463011534797,5.3698846520267e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
11832,Role of ethylene in the protection of tomato plants against soil-borne fungal pathogens conferred by an endophytic Fusarium solani strain,"An endophytic fungal isolate (Fs-K), identified as a Fusarium solani strain, was obtained from root tissues of tomato plants grown on a compost which suppressed soil and foliar pathogens. Strain Fs-K was able to colonize root tissues and subsequently protect plants against the root pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici (FORL), and elicit induced systemic resistance against the tomato foliar pathogen Septoria lycopersici. Interestingly, attenuated expression of certain pathogenesis-related genes, i.e. PR5 and PR7, was detected in tomato roots inoculated with strain Fs-K compared with non-inoculated plants. The expression pattern of PR genes was either not affected or aberrant in leaves. A genetic approach, using mutant tomato plant lines, was used to determine the role of ethylene and jasmonic acid in the plant's response to infection by the soil-borne pathogen F. oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici (FORL), in the presence or absence of isolate Fs-K. Mutant tomato lines Never ripe (Nr) and epinastic (epi1), both impaired in ethylene-mediated plant responses, inoculated with FORL are not protected by isolate Fs-K, indicating that the ethylene signalling pathway is required for the mode of action used by the endophyte to confer resistance. On the contrary, def1 mutants, affected in jasmonate biosynthesis, show reduced susceptibility to FORL, in the presence Fs-K, which suggests that jasmonic acid is not essential for the mediation of biocontrol activity of isolate Fs-K.","Kavroulakis, N; Ntougias, S; Zervakis, GI; Ehaliotis, C; Haralampidis, K; Papadopoulou, KK",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,2007,10.1093/jxb/erm230,0.9545201141432,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.531249884052594,0.468750115947406,0.999802528031089,1.9747196891051e-4,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

9766,Sydowia polyspora is both a Foliar Endophyte and a Preemergent Seed Pathogen in Pinus ponderosa,"Poor seedling performance and reduced seed emergence are often ascribed to known pathogens that cause low seedling recruitment and poor seed emergence in forest nurseries and regeneration plantings. On the other hand, foliar endophytes are often overlooked as a source of poor emergence or tree seedling disease. Here, we show that an endophytic fungus common to the foliar microbiome of Pinus ponderosa acts as a cryptic pathogen in delaying emergence. In a series of experiments, we inoculated seed of P. ponderosa with a suspension of Sydowia polyspora 12 h prior to sowing. S. polyspora reduced seed emergence of its host, P. ponderosa, by as much as 30%. A tetrazolium chloride viability assay showed that S. polyspora reduces emergence by preventing germination; seed remained viable. In sum, pathogens affecting tree seed emergence and seedling recruitment may be endophytic as well as in seed and soil and deserve greater attention in studies of natural regeneration.","Ridout, M; Newcombe, G",PLANT DISEASE,2018,10.1094/PDIS-07-17-1074-RE,0.971549605786835,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991967182578272,0.0080328174217277,0.999979848867665,2.01511323350001e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
4761,"Characterization of Trichoderma polysporum from Spitsbergen, Svalbard archipelago, Norway, with species identity, pathogenicity to moss, and polygalacturonase activity","Six isolates of Trichoderma polysporum-like species isolated from a moss (Sanionia uncinata) in high arctic wetlands at Spitsbergen Island, Svalbard, Norway, were examined for species identification, effects of temperature on growth, pathogenicity to the moss, and polygalacturonase (PGase) activity. All isolates from Spitsbergen were identified as T. polysporum based on morphology, sequences of the rDNA-ITS regions, and growth response to temperature. In addition, two isolates of T. polysporum from Germany and Japan were used. All isolates from Spitsbergen, Germany and Japan infected epidermal tissues of the moss, but did not cause any symptoms in in vitro inoculation tests at 0 degrees C. One of the isolates from Spitsbergen and the German isolate showed high activity of PGase, an enzyme produced by many saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi, in a pectin liquid medium. The enzyme activity was evident for both isolates even at 0 degrees C. The present results document the presence of T. polysporum in the high arctic wetlands. The epidermal infection to the moss and PGase production at 0 degrees C of the T. polysporum isolates suggest that the species likely inhabits a niche as a saprotroph or an endophyte in the arctic environments.

Three of these unidentified taxa were among the six most frequently encountered profiles. Phylogenetic analyses of ITS and nuclear LSU sequences revealed a close relationship among the three fungi and that they belong to the family Sebacinaceae (sensu Weiss and Oberwinkler 2001).

A single PCR fragment was amplified in all but two of the 24 samples tested and digestion with two restriction enzymes produced RFLP profiles which matched those from the Sebacinoid sequence.

13860,Selectivity of and Resistance Against Systemic Fungicides,"The newly developed systemic fungicides exert a selective influence on fungi. As a consequence these fungicides may cause a shift in the microbiological balance of the plant environment, especially in the soil, and also on the aerial parts of plants. Potential pathogens which under undisturbed conditions cause little harm to the crop because of the antagonism of other members of the microflora, may come to the foreground after the elimination of their antagonists by a selective fungicide. Some examples of this phenomenon are presented. Systemic fungicides may also be very selective with respect to the site of attack in the fungal cell. Fungi may adapt more rapidly to these biochemically selective fungicides than to conventional fungicides. In several cases a mutation in one gene appears responsible for the development of resistance. A list of examples of acquired resistance to systemic fungicides, recorded during the last three years, is given and the possibilities of coping with this problem are discussed. Sélectivité des fongicides systémiques et phénomènes de résistance Il est apparu que les fongicides sélectifs exercent une profonde influence sur l'équilibre microbiologique dont peut résulter le développement de certains pathogènes soustraits à l'effet de certains antagonismes. Ceci a été démontré par Bollen (1971) au cours d'essais entrepris sur seigle à Wageningen où 3 applications au bénomyl ont favorisé l'apparition de symptômes attribués à une souche de Rhizoctonia solani Kühn. De plus, le bénomyl a révélé la faculté d'agir sur les propriétés antibiotiques des champignons. Lorsque deux champignons placés en milieu d'agar sont mis en présence de concentrations sublétales de bénomyl, on a observé que l'antagonisme entre les deux agents pathogènes subit des modifications. Ce genre de phénomène se produit d'une façon similaire sur les parties aériennes de la plante (Bollen et Scholten, 1971). L'emploi des fongicides traditionnels n'a pas suscité de reels problèmes de résistance, sauf par exemple dans le cas des biphényles qui sont utilisés pour combattre la pourrimre des agrumes et du quintozène destinéà lutter contre le rhizoctone de la pomme de terre. Avec l'introducrion des fongicides systémiques, ces phénomènes se sont cependant multipliés. Aux Pays‐Bas, le diméthirimol, largement employé dans les serres pour tenir en échec l'oîdium du concombre, accusait déjà en 1969 un fléchissement d'efficacité que les études faices en laboratoire ont permis d'assimiler à un effet de résistance. Dans le cas de Sphaerotheca fuliginea (Schlecht.) Salm. (cf. tableaux 1 et 2) un comportement similaire a été observé. La résistance peut être la conséquence de changements génétiques de la cellule ou celle, moins fréquente, de causes indépendantes de ces phénomènes, telles qu'une adaptation enzymatique, par exemple. L'action du fongicide sur la cellule du champignon est compliquée comme le montre le tableau 3, et ce sont finalement les altérations physiologiques et bicchimiques encore mal connues qui péuvent determiner la résistance. Face à cette complexité d'interférences, il est difficile de préjuger de la capacité d'adaptation du champignon à l'égard d'un nouveau fongicide systémique. Lors d'applications pratiques, il est cependant important d'espacer l'emploi du mime fongicide afin de réduire la probabiliré d'adaptation. Une rotation de fongicides à modes d'action dissemblables est donc recommandée, dans la mesure du possible. La question de la réversibilité d'une résistance acquise est encore mal élucidée, mais il semblerait, par analogie avec certains insecticides, que ce processus, bien que possible, demeure seulement partiel.

8977,Biological Evaluation of Subglutinol A As a Novel Immunosuppressive Agent for Inflammation Intervention,"Subglutinol A (1) is an immunosuppressive natural product isolated from Fusarium subglutinans, an endophytic fungus from the vine Tripterygium wilfordii. We show that 1 exerts multimodal immune-suppressive effects on activated T cells in vitro: subglutinol A (1) effectively blocks T cell proliferation and survival while profoundly inhibiting pro-inflammatory IFN gamma and IL-17 production by fully differentiated effector Th1 and Th17 cells. Our data further reveal that 1 may exert its anti-inflammatory effects by exacerbating mitochondrial damage in T cells. Additionally, we demonstrate that 1 significantly reduces lymphocytic infiltration into the footpad and ameliorates footpad swelling in the mouse model of Th1-driven delayed-type hypersensitivity. These results suggest the potential of I as a novel therapeutic for inflammatory diseases.","Lin, R; Kim, H; Hong, J; Li, QJ",ACS MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS,2014,10.1021/ml4004809,0.949211992727134,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.983827456535848,0.0161725434641517,0.999999983892201,1.61077987614888e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

358,Fusaristerol A: A New Cytotoxic and Antifungal Ergosterol Fatty Acid Ester from the Endophytic Fungus Fusarium sp Associated with Mentha longifolia Roots,"Background: Endophytic fungi are of a growing interest as prominent sources of structurally unique bioactive natural products. Objective: This study aims to isolate and characterize bio-metabolites from the endophytic fungus Fusarium sp. isolated from Mentha longifolia L. roots as well as to assess the antimicrobial and cytotoxic potential of these metabolites. Materials and Methods: The endophytic fungi Fusarium sp. was cultured on a rice medium. The rice cultures' ethyl acetate extract was separated using various chromatographic techniques (SiO2, RP-18, and sephadex LH-20) to afford four metabolites. Their structural characterization was achieved by various spectroscopic analyses, as well as comparing with the published data. Results: A new ergosterol derivative namely, fusaristerol A (22E, 24R-5 beta, 8 beta-epidioxyergosta-22-en-3 beta-yl decanoate) (1), along with ergosta7,22-diene-3 beta, 5 beta, 6 beta-triol (2), ergosta-5,7,22-triene-3 beta-ol (3), and (22E, 24R)-ergosta-7,22-dien-3 beta-ol (4), was separated. Fusaristerol A (1) possessed a significant antifungal activity toward Candida albicans with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 8.3 mu g/disc compared to clotrimazole (MIC 5.1 mu g/disc). Moreover, it displayed a potent cytotoxic potential toward HCT-116 cell line with an half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 0.21 mu M, compared to doxorubicin (IC50 0.06 mu M). Conclusion: This is the first report for separation of a 5,8-epidioxy ergostane derivative from Fusarium sp. Fusaristerol A may provide a new promising candidate for the development of a potential anti-candida and cytotoxic agent.","Ibrahim, SRM; Mohamed, GA; Al Haidari, RA; El-Kholy, AAS; Asfour, HZ; Zayed, MF",PHARMACOGNOSY MAGAZINE,2018,10.4103/pm.pm_113_18,0.934231455664515,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.954809877014626,0.0451901229853735,0.99999995521031,4.47896900679368e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

274,Fungal endophytes from medicinal plant Bletilla striata (Thunb.) Reichb. F. promote the host plant growth and phenolic accumulation,"Endophytic fungi are capable of increasing the growth and secondary metabolite production of medicinal plants in an ecofriendly and sustainable manner. Although these responses have been demonstrated in many plant species, they are not well understood in the medicinal plant Bletilla striata (Thunb.) Reichb.F.. Co -culture of B.striata with three endofungal isolates was carried out to evaluate the effects of endophytic fungal interaction on the plant growth and accumulation of phenols. The plant growth-promoting traits of isolated fungi were investigated, and the isolates had the ability to produce indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), siderophore and cellulolytic enzyme. The fungal strain Byssochlamys spectabilis 1-N2 co-cultured with plantlets of B. striata significantly increased certain growth properties, including shoot length by 71.40%, pseudobulbs dry weight by 52.58%, number of new roots by 5.25-fold, pseudobulbs diameter by 30.94% and improved the total phenolic content of the medicinal part by 25.41%. The fungal polysaccharide elicitor prepared from B. spectabilis 1-N2 mycelium also altered the accumulation of total phenolic content at different time points. Polysaccharide elicitor treatment significantly enhanced the accumulation of nitric oxide (NO) and salicylic acid (SA), which are involved in the plant defence response and significantly upregulated the activities of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) and tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL). The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of B. striata and endophytic fungi interactions and provide vital information for the use of endophytic fungi to improve plant growth and active component accumulation in B.striata cultivation.

4346,Root stoichiometry explains wheat endophytes and their link with crop production after four decades of fertilization,"Fertilization can impact root endophytic microbiomes and food production. However, the impacts of decades of continued fertilization on root microbiomes, and their link with ongoing crop production, remain poorly understood. Here, we used a four decade-long fertilization experiment, including contrasting types of organic and inorganic fertil-ization, to investigate the effects of long-term fertilization on multi-kingdom root endophytic microbiomes, including keystone species (modules within microbial networks), and their indirect associations with the production of wheat, which is one of the most important crops worldwide. We found that long-term inorganic (nitrogen, phosphorus, potas-sium (NPK)) and organic (NPK with straw (NPKS) and NPK with cow manure (NPKM)) fertilization had significant impacts on the community composition of endophytic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), bacteria, and non-mycorrhizal fungi. In addition, compared with NPK fertilization, NPKS and NPKM amendments significantly decreased the microbial network complexity, which was associated with changes in the root iron content. Finally, we identified an important subset of keystone root endophyte species within the microbial network (Module #2), which was positively correlated with wheat yield, and affected by changes in root carbon to phosphorus ratio. This study provides evidence that long-term fertilization can affect keystone root endophytic species in the root microbiome, with implications for food security in an over-fertilized world.","Ma, YY; Wang, DZ; Guo, XS; Zhu, YG; Delgado-Baquerizo, M; Chu, HY",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157407,0.730106061978839,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.898749711468918,0.101250288531082,0.999999999999028,9.72111280361787e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

9428,"Anti-inflammatory action of ambuic acid, a natural product isolated from the solid culture of Pestalotiopsis neglecta, through blocking ERK/JNK mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway","Ambuic acid is an organic acid isolated from the solid culture of Pestalotiopsis neglecta, which is an endophytic fungus that widely exists in many species of plants. Ambuic acid has been reported to exert antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacterium. The aim of the present study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of ambuic acid on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in RAW264.7 macrophages. The results demonstrated that ambuic acid significantly suppressed the overproduction of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, ambuic acid also inhibited the release of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) however, no inhibition of the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was observed. Further investigations indicated that ambuic acid downregulated the LPS-induced high expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) proteins, as well as inhibited the enzymatic activity of iNOS and COX-2. In addition, ambuic acid suppressed the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinasc 1/2 (ERK 1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) induced by LYS. However, ambuic acid did not inhibit the phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the degradation of I kappa B-alpha protein or the nuclear translocation of nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) p65 subunit. These results suggested that ambuic acid may exert anti-inflammatory action by blocking the activation of the ERK/JNK MAPK signaling pathway, without the involvement of the p38 MAPK or NT-kappa B signaling pathways.","Zhang, Q; Luan, RL; Li, HX; Liu, YA; Liu, P; Wang, LY; Li, DN; Wang, MD; Zou, Q; Liu, HW; Matsuzaki, K; Zhao, F",EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE,2018,10.3892/etm.2018.6294,0.98005766747079,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.731991248006368,0.268008751993632,0.999577128488081,4.2287151191888e-4,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
6246,Endophytic fungal metabolite fumigaclavine C causes relaxation of isolated rat aortic rings,"Two indole alkaloids were isolated from the culture of Aspergillus fumigatus (strain No. CY018), an endophytic fungus harboring inside the elder leaf of Cynodon dactylon. These two chemicals were identified as fumigaclavine C and fumitremorgin C. In screening the bioactivity of these two indole alkaloids, their vasorelaxant effects on isolated rat thoracic aortic rings were observed. The results showed that fumigaclavine C exhibited potent concentration-dependent vasorelaxant actions in isolated rat aortic rings pre-contracted by high K+ or phenylephrine (with EC50 values of 5.62 mu mol/L and 1.58 mu mol/L, respectively) whereas fumitremorgin C displayed a weaker vasorelaxation. A detailed investigation was therefore performed with fumigaclavine C. The vasorelaxing action of fumigaclavine C is independent of the presence of endothelium, suggesting its effect of vasorelaxation was not related to endothelial mediators. Blockage of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels, activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels and inhibition of Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ stores may be involved in fumigaclavine C induced relaxation of rat isolated aortic rings. These results demonstrate that fumigaclavine C from the endophytic fungus has a potential capacity in vascular protection and thus may have therapeutic use in protection against cardiovascular disease.","Ma, HY; Song, YC; Mao, YY; Jiang, JH; Tan, RX; Luo, L",PLANTA MEDICA,2006,10.1055/s-2005-916235,0.997000540354437,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.965116228780609,0.0348837712193911,0.999999999992018,7.98194843554256e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

In this study, we inoculated sterile drought-stressed Ormosia hosiei seedlings with the DSE species Acrocalymma vagum to determine the role that the DSE plays in seedling growth and drought tolerance of O. hosiei. We investigated whether inoculation with DSE affected the leaf morphology, anatomical structure, pigments, photosynthesis, and chloroplast ultrastructure. Inoculated seedlings and non-inoculated seedlings were grown under three different soil water conditions (well-watered, 75% of field water capacity; moderate water, 55% of field water capacity; or low water, 35% of field water capacity) for 114 days. The leaf length, leaf width, leaf area, leaf dry weight, leaf palisade tissue thickness, vascular bundle area, and the inner diameter of vessels of the inoculated seedlings were significantly greater than those of non-inoculated seedlings. Furthermore, the content of pigments, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and the transpiration rate of inoculated seedlings were significantly higher than those of the non-inoculated seedlings, whereas the intracellular CO2 concentration was significantly lower than that of non-inoculated seedlings. The mitochondria, chloroplasts, and cell membrane were well preserved under water stress in the inoculated seedlings, whereas the chloroplasts and other leaf cell organelles of the non-inoculated seedlings were severely damaged.

17323,"First Report of Colletotrichum karstii Causing Glomerella Leaf Spot on Apple in Santa Catarina State, Brazil.","Glomerella leaf spot (GLS) is an emerging disease of apple (Malus domestica Borkh.) that has been reported in regions with a humid subtropical climate, such as southern Brazil, the southeastern United States, and more recently eastern China. GLS is favored by high humidity and temperatures between 23 and 28°C and can result in extensive defoliation when the severity is high. The disease was first reported 1988 in Brazil on cvs. Gala and Golden Delicious in orchards in Paraná State (3), but now is widespread in the country's producing areas. Two Colletotrichum species of different complexes have been associated with GLS, C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. and its sexual stage Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spaulding & Scherenk, and C. acutatum J. H. Simmonds, although GLS is more commonly associated with the former. In the summer of 2012, necrotic spots were observed on apple leaves (cv. Gala) in Santa Catarina state, Brazil. The first symptoms were reddish-brown spots, evolving to small necrotic lesions 1 to 10 mm long at 7 to 10 days after symptoms were first noted. Pure cultures were obtained by monosporic isolation and grown on PDA at 25°C and with a 12-h photoperiod under fluorescent light. The color of the upper surface of the colony varied from white to gray and the reverse was pink. The conidia length and width ranged from 9.1 to 17.1 μm ( = 12.8) and from 2.9 to 6.8 μm ( = 4.9), respectively, and were cylindrical, hyaline, and straight. After germination, conidia formed oval or circular appressoria measuring between 4.0 and 10.0 ( = 6.3) × 3.0 and 9.0 ( = 5.7). To confirm pathogenicity, susceptible apple seedlings (cv. Gala) were inoculated with a suspension of 1 × 106 conidia.mL-1. Seedlings sprayed with sterile distilled water served as controls. Seedlings were incubated in a moist chamber at 25°C and 100% RH for 48 h. First symptoms appeared 4 days after inoculation and were similar to those observed in the field. The control treatment remained symptomless. The pathogen was reisolated from lesions, confirming Koch's postulates. Fungus was molecularly characterized by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and the nucleotide sequence was deposited in the GenBank database (KC876638 and KC875408). C. karstii, considered as part of the C. boninense species complex (1), was identified with 100% sequence homology. This species was previously reported in China (4), Thailand, and the United States, affecting Orchidaceae plants (2), and in Brazil it has been reported affecting Carica papaya, Eugenia uniflora, and Bombax aquaticum (1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. karstii causing GLS on apple in Brazil. The development of pre-harvest management practices may be warranted to manage this disease.

5650,"Effect of fungicides, endophytes and fungal filtrates on in vitro growth of Spanish isolates of Gremmeniella abietina","The effect of eight fungicides and 15 endophytes isolated from twigs of healthy Pinus halepensis trees on the growth rate of four Spanish isolates of the pathogen Gremmeniella abietina was evaluated in vitro. In the fungicide experiments, four doses of each fungicide tested were added to the growth medium. In the endophyte experiments, dual cultures endophyte-pathogen were paired in Petri dishes. Furthermore, growth of three G. abietina isolates was evaluated on malt agar with pine needle extract amended with filtrates from cultures of endophyte E14, which produced a brownish compound apparently inhibiting G. abietina growth. The results obtained suggested that chlorothalonil and daconil were the most suitable fungicides at low doses to reduce growth of G. abietina isolates from Spain. Four of the endophytes tested in vitro showed strong antagonistic activity against G. abietina and deserve further testing in vivo. The endophyte E14 produced in vitro a brownish compound which almost completely inhibited mycelial growth of G. abietina isolates from Spain.","Santamaría, O; González, MA; Pajares, JA; Diez, JJ",FOREST PATHOLOGY,2007,10.1111/j.1439-0329.2007.00498.x,0.96180039383644,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.986661805362906,0.013338194637094,0.999999999911415,8.858491717944619e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2704,"Ecological and Evolutionary Stabilities of Biotrophism, Necrotrophism, and Saprotrophism","Fungi have multiple trophic behaviors, including biotrophism (parasitism on living hosts), necrotrophism (parasitism through killing host tissues), and saprotrophism (feeding on decaying organic matter). Historical classifications of plant pathogens are based on many different axes, including their trophic dependence on living and dead plants, their pathogenicity and mutualistic relationship to host plants, and their transmission pathways and infection mechanisms. Such diverse classifications sometimes conflict with each other. Clarifying the delineations among these groups would promote synthesis of fungal biology with current ecological and evolutionary concepts. To ask when biotrophic, necrotrophic, or saprotrophic fungi are maintained and favored by selection, we constructed an epidemiological model that describes the transitions between four states of host plants: susceptible living plant (S), infected living plant (I), uninfected dead plant (D), and infected dead plant, or plant residue (R). States S and D represent two kinds of resource-living and dead plant tissues-for fungal inocula (I and R). We obtained values for the basic reproductive number (R-0), which defines the persistence criteria of fungi. On the basis of our results, we propose four types of ecological groups, corresponding to the patterns of dependence on nutrient resources: (1) parasitism-dependent fungi, characterized by their critical dependence on living plants; (2) saprotrophism-dependent fungi, characterized by their critical dependence on dead plants; (3) facultatively dependent fungi, which are neither parasitism nor saprotrophism dependent; and (4) doubly dependent fungi, which are neither wholly parasitism dependent nor wholly saprotrophism dependent. This grouping can be used to suggest principles for effective pest control. Our model also reveals simple conditions for the evolution of fungal trophic behaviors. We found that, in the absence of a trade-off between virulence and other life-history parameters, milder fungal virulence in living plants is always selected for if plant-fungus population dynamics are stable. However, with sufficiently strong necrotrophic transmission, the host population densities show sustained cycles, which promote the evolution of higher virulence. Epidemiological synthesis of diverse trophism in plant-fungi relationship in our model thus opens the way to discuss the evolution of fungal lifestyles as a function of ecological conditions.","Suzuki, SU; Sasaki, A",AMERICAN NATURALIST,2019,10.1086/703485,0.856888059431413,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.983748171918105,0.0162518280818948,0.999670504124497,3.2949587550346e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
14434,"Effects of different endophytic fungi on growth and contents of C, N, P, and K of seedlings of aleurites montana under phosphorus deficiency condition","Four dominant endophytic fungus strains 〔SJ4, SJ3 and ZG3 strains (Penicillium), and SY1 strain (Thermomyces)〕 isolated from Aleurites montana (Lour.) Wils. were inoculated on root of potted seedlings, and effects of endophytic fungi on growth of seedlings and nutrient element accumulation in leaf and root of A. montana after cultivating for 60 d under different degrees of phosphorus deficiency conditions were studied. The results show that there are different degrees of differences in each growth index of seedlings inoculated with or without (the control) fungus strains under conditions of normal phosphorus supply, and light, moderate and severe phosphorus deficiency (48, 24, 12, and 0 mg·kg-1 of phosphorus supply amount, respectively); with increasing of phosphorus deficiency degree, each growth index of seedlings inoculated with or without fungus strains show different variation tendencies. In which, there is no significant difference (P>0.05) in dry weight, increasing rates of ground diameter and height of seedlings inoculated with fungus strains and the control under conditions of normal phosphorus supply and light phosphorus deficiency; under moderate phosphorus deficiency condition, above growth indexes of seedlings inoculated with SJ4 strain are obviously higher than those of the control; under severe phosphorus deficiency condition, dry weight of seedlings inoculated with SJ3 strain and increasing rates of ground diameter and height of seedlings inoculated with SJ4 strain are obviously higher than those of the control. Under normal phosphorus supply condition, contents of C, N, P and K, and C:N ratio in leaf and root of seedlings of the control are generally higher than those of seedlings inoculated with fungus strains or show no significant difference with the latter; but under different degrees of phosphorus deficiency conditions, contents of C, N, P and K, and C: N ratio in leaf and root of seedlings of the control decrease in general, while those of some seedlings inoculated with fungus strains increase at different degrees. In which, under severe phosphorus deficiency condition, contents of C, P and K, and C:N ratio in leaf of seedlings inoculated with SJ3 and ZG3 strains, contents of N, P, and K in leaf and root of seedlings inoculated with SJ4 strain, and contents of N and P in leaf and root of seedlings inoculated with SY1 strain are all significantly (P<0.05) higher than those of the control. The comprehensive analysis results show that inoculating endophytic fungi are beneficial for growth and nutrient element accumulation of seedlings of A. montana under phosphorus deficiency condition, in which, promoting effect on growth and K accumulation of Penicillium strains are better than those of Thermomyces strains, while promoting effect on P accumulation of Thermomyces strains are better than that of Penicillium strains. © 2017, Editorial Office, Journal of Plant Resources and Environment.

Leaf surfaces were extensively colonized by an anastomosing network of germ-tubes and conidia. This epiphytic mycelium produced abundant Secondary conidia on short conidiophores. Although melanized appressoria were developed, the host surface was not penetrated directly. The fungus only gained ingress into leaves through stomatal openings, by means of undifferentiated germ-tubes, and slowly colonized the mesophyll by intercellular hyphae, without initially Producing visible symptoms. Anthracnose lesions with multisetate acervuli appeared on senescent leaves after a prolonged symptomless period of host colonization lasting >2 weeks. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the amplified D2 and ITS-2 regions of rDNA revealed close similarities (95-96%)between this cowpea pathogen and isolates of C. gloeosporioides from Aeschynomene virginica, Stylosanthes scabra and Mangifera indica.

13894,"Studies on the systemic fungus, Puccinia suaveolens","The autoecious rust Puccinia suaveolens attacks the creeping thistle Cirsium arvense. Infection with uredospores first produces isolated uredc-pustules, usually with teleutospores. The mycelium later grows down into the roots and becomes systemic. In some of the root-buds the mycelium appears unchanged and bears uredosori; in others it undergoes a somatic segregation of mating type and bears spermogonia only. Teleutospore germination is so erratic that basidio-spore infection is responsible for only a small amount of the spermogonial infection observed.The spermogonial mycelium in the systemically infected shoots is heterothallic and there are two mating types. All the spermogonia on one shoot bear spermatia of only one mating type. Therefore segregation of mating type must take place at the base of the shoot or even in the roots. The multinucleate condition of the mycelium in both uredosoral and spermogonial shoots makes it impossible to observe segregation directly. © 1953 Oxford University Press.",Menzies B.P.,Annals of Botany,1953,10.1093/oxfordjournals.aob.a083369,0.899429956393039,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.868554561340859,0.131445438659141,0.999998864659772,1.13534022849748e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

19014,Environmental microbes alleviate antibiotic disturbance on plant endophytes in aquatic microcosms: Prospects for conferring fitness benefits.,"Antibiotic pollution in water environment is an emerging threat to plant health. Developing efficient strategies to reassemble the antibiotic-tolerating endophytes will confer fitness benefits on host plants to alleviate antibiotic stress. Here, introducing environmental microbes was proved as a promising approach to reshape the antibiotic-tolerating plant endophytes under antibiotic stress in aquatic microcosms. The introduction of environmental microbes effectively relieved antibiotic-driven perturbation on plant endophytes, with reduced changes in bacterial diversity and differential bacterial taxa and functional genes. Moreover, introducing environmental microbes facilitated the enrichment of endophytic bacterial genera and functional genes related to drug metabolism, which possessed the potentials to degrade antibiotics. In addition, environmental microbes boosted antibiotic-reshaped endophytes to form more stable bacterial networks for stronger antibiotic tolerance. In consequence, the decreased growth inhibition of antibiotics on host plants and enhanced antibiotic removal from microcosms were achieved by introducing environmental microbes. These findings pursue environmental microbes as practical resources to assist plants in reshaping the stress-alleviating endophytes, potentially improving plant tolerance to water pollution.",Hu Y; Meng FL; Zhao JH; Sheng GP,Water research,2024,10.1016/j.watres.2024.122112,0.817112144111047,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.454934713850919,0.545065286149081,0.999828064122506,1.7193587749386e-4,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
8321,THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AN ENDANGERED NORTH-AMERICAN TREE AND AN ENDOPHYTIC FUNGUS,"Background: The Florida torreya (Torreya taxifolia) began a catastrophic decline in the late 1950s and is now the rarest tree in North America for which a full species designation has been established. The trees have common plant disease symptoms, but the reason for the decline has never been identified. ?: taxifolia's imminent extinction gains special poignancy through its close relationship to the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia), which produces the potent anticancer agent, taxol. Results: An examination of the endophytic fungal communities of wild torreyas consistently found a filamentous fungus, Pestalotiopsis microspora, associated with diseased trees and also with most symptomless trees. P. microspora can be cultured in the laboratory, and when it is introduced into greenhouse-grown torreyas, it causes disease symptoms similar to those seen in the field. The fungus can then be reisolated from these deliberately infected trees. The phytotoxins pestalopyrone, hydroxypestalopyrone and pestaloside have been isolated and characterized from axenic fungal cultures, and both pestalopyrone and hydroxypestalopyrone can be isolated hom artificially infected torreyas. In addition, pestaloside has antifungal activity against other fungal endophytes of ?: taxifolia. Conclusions: The filamentous Fungus, P. microspora, has an endophytic-pathologic relationship with ?: taxifolia. The fungus resides in the inner bark of symptomless trees, and physiological or environmental factors could trigger its pathological activity. P. microspora produces the phytotoxins pestalopyrone, hydroxypestalopyrone, and pestaloside which give rise to the disease. Pestaloside, which also has antifungal activity, could reduce competition from other fungal endophytes within the host.","LEE, JC; YANG, XS; SCHWARTZ, M; STROBEL, G; CLARDY, J",CHEMISTRY & BIOLOGY,1995,10.1016/1074-5521(95)90100-0,0.987184982695581,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.988541873694324,0.0114581263056758,0.999999992716124,7.283875946839661e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Therefore, the objective of the present work was the isolation of the fungal microbiota present in the sugarcane straw (CP 72-2082) and its capacity to produce hydrolytic enzymes. The fungal microbiota was isolated by sampling for four months one sampling for month the straw in fields of the ""El Potrero"" sugar mill in the Veracruz state, Mexico, and soil was also sampled to determine the effect of straw chili on the organic matter content. Furthermore, the capacity of the strains to produce xylanases and cellulases was determined in a Petri dish using birch xylan and carboxymethylcellulose as substrates. Thirty-four strains were isolated from the samples, in all was identified the genera Trichoderma, Fusarium in three and Aspergillus and Penicillum in two. The results indicate that if sugarcane straw is reincorporated into soils where sugarcane is grown, it can have a beneficial impact, 22 isolated strains showed the ability to produce hydrolytic enzymes. The organic matter content in the soils with both shredded and unshredded crop residues showed that chili does not present a benefit to the soil but can contribute beneficial fungal microbiota for various purposes.","Mendoza-Infante, NG; de la Vequia, HD; Hidalgo-Contreras, JV; Mugica-Alvarez, V; Hernández-Martínez, R",REVISTA DE LA FACULTAD DE AGRONOMIA DE LA UNIVERSIDAD DEL ZULIA,2022,10.47280/RevFacAgron(LUZ).v39.n1.08,0.954877031926709,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.792716234945692,0.207283765054308,0.99999907805779,9.21942209575199e-7,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
5284,Microbial population dynamics in response to Pectobacterium atrosepticum infection in potato tubers,"Endophytes are microbes and fungi that live inside plant tissues without damaging the host. Herein we examine the dynamic changes in the endophytic bacterial community in potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber in response to pathogenic infection by Pectobacterium atrosepticum, which causes soft rot in numerous economically important crops. We quantified community changes using both cultivation and next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and found that, despite observing significant variability in both the mass of macerated tissue and structure of the endophytic community between individual potato tubers, P. atrosepticum is always taken over by the endophytes during maceration. 16S rDNA sequencing revealed bacteria from the phyla Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Acidobacteria, TM7, and Deinococcus-Thermus. Prior to infection, Propionibacterium acnes is frequently among the dominant taxa, yet is out competed by relatively few dominant taxa as the infection proceeds. Two days post-infection, the most abundant sequences in macerated potato tissue are Gammaproteobacteria. The most dominant genera are Enterobacter and Pseudomonas. Eight days post-infection, the number of anaerobic pectolytic Clostridia increases, probably due to oxygen depletion. These results demonstrate that the pathogenesis is strictly initiated by the pathogen (sensu stricto) and proceeds with a major contribution from the endophytic community.","Koiv, V; Roosaare, M; Vedler, E; Kivistik, PA; Toppi, K; Schryer, DW; Remm, M; Tenson, T; Mäe, A",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2015,10.1038/srep11606,0.999457805452803,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.887204352655782,0.112795647344218,0.999994155841133,5.8441588668412e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

3463,Landscape scale ecology of Tetracladium spp. fungal root endophytes,"Background The genus Tetracladium De Wild. (Ascomycota) has been traditionally regarded as a group of Ingoldian fungi or aquatic hyphomycetes-a polyphyletic group of phylogenetically diverse fungi which grow on decaying leaves and plant litter in streams. Recent sequencing evidence has shown that Tetracladium spp. may also exist as root endophytes in terrestrial environments, and furthermore may have beneficial effects on the health and growth of their host. However, the diversity of Tetracladium spp. communities in terrestrial systems and the factors which shape their distribution are largely unknown. Results Using a fungal community internal transcribed spacer amplicon dataset from 37 UK Brassica napus fields we found that soils contained diverse Tetracladium spp., most of which represent previously uncharacterised clades. The two most abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs), related to previously described aquatic T. furcatum and T. maxilliforme, were enriched in roots relative to bulk and rhizosphere soil. For both taxa, relative abundance in roots, but not rhizosphere or bulk soil was correlated with B. napus yield. The relative abundance of T. furcatum and T. maxilliforme OTUs across compartments showed very similar responses with respect to agricultural management practices and soil characteristics. The factors shaping the relative abundance of OTUs homologous to T. furcatum and T. maxilliforme OTUs in roots were assessed using linear regression and structural equation modelling. Relative abundance of T. maxilliforme and T. furcatum in roots increased with pH, concentrations of phosphorus, and increased rotation frequency of oilseed rape. It decreased with increased soil water content, concentrations of extractable phosphorus, chromium, and iron. Conclusions The genus Tetracladium as a root colonising endophyte is a diverse and widely distributed part of the oilseed rape microbiome that positively correlates to crop yield.

In recent years, phytoremediation assisted by bacterial endophytes has been highly recommended for cleaning up of metal polluted soils since endophytic bacteria can alleviate metal toxicity in plant through their own metal resistance system and facilitate plant growth under metal stress. Endophytic bacteria improve plant growth in metal polluted soils in two different ways: 1) directly by producing plant growth beneficial substances including solubilization/transformation of mineral nutrients (phosphate, nitrogen and potassium), production of phytohormones, siderophores and specific enzymes; and 2) indirectly through controlling plant pathogens or by inducing a systemic resistance of plants against pathogens. Besides, they also alter metal accumulation capacity in plants by excreting metal immobilizing extracellular polymeric substances, as well as metal mobilizing organic acids and biosurfactants. The present work aims to review the progress of recent research on the isolation, identification and diversity of metal resistant endophytic bacteria and illustrate various mechanisms responsible for plant growth promotion and heavy metal detoxification/phytoaccumulation/translocation in plants.",Ma Y; Rajkumar M; Zhang C; Freitas H,Journal of environmental management,2016,10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.02.047,0.754617966165299,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.456627011590988,0.543372988409012,0.999999518389733,4.81610267000221e-7,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
18906,The fall armyworm converts maize endophytes into its own probiotics to detoxify benzoxazinoids and promote caterpillar growth.,"The fall armyworm (FAW, Spodoptera frugiperda) threatens maize production worldwide, and benzoxazinoids (Bxs) are known as the main secondary metabolites produced by maize to defend against FAW. However, we do not yet know whether and in what ways certain endophytes in the digestive system of FAW can metabolize Bxs, thus enhancing the fitness of FAW when feeding on maize. Using Bxs as the sole carbon and nitrogen source, we isolated Pantoea dispersa from the guts of FAW. P. dispersa can colonize maize roots and leaves as indicated by GFP-labeling and further successfully established itself as an endophyte in the Malpighian tubules and the gut of FAW after FAW feeding activities. Once established, it can be vertically transmitted through FAW eggs, suggesting the potential that FAW can convert maize-derived endophytes into symbiotic bacteria for intergenerational transmission. The prevalence of P. dispersa in FAW guts and maize leaves was also confirmed over large geographic regions, indicating its evolutionary adaptation in fields. Bxs determination in the gut and frass of FAW combined with bioassays performance on maize bx2 mutants revealed that the colonization of P. dispersa can promote FAW growth by metabolizing Bxs rather than other metabolites. Additionally, genome and transcriptome analyses identified plasmid-borne genes, rather than chromosomes of this species, were crucial for Bxs metabolism. This was further validated through in vitro prokaryotic expression assays by expressing two candidate genes form the plasmid. FAW can convert maize endophytes into its own probiotics to detoxify Bxs and thus enhance caterpillar growth. This represents a novel strategy for lepidopteran pests-transforming allies of the host into its own-thereby shedding light on the rapid spread of FAW and enhancing our understanding of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms underlying the pest-microbe-plant interactions.

Though their origin and evolution is enigmatic, they are known to play an important role in plant growth and development. Here we explore the endophytic fungal diversity of a perennial creeping vine, Ipomea pes-caprae (family Convolulaceae), occurring naturally in the coastal sand dunes of peninsular India. Of the ten endophytes isolated from the plant, Fusarium oxysporum (MH511104) was found to grow even at 2 M NaCl in potato dextrose agar medium. The fungus was able to successfully colonize and impart salinity tolerance to salt-sensitive paddy variety, IR-64. We discuss these results in the context of increasing global interest on endophytes as a possible alternative route to crop improvement.","Manasa, KM; Vasanthakumari, MM; Nataraja, KN; Shaanker, RU",CURRENT SCIENCE,2020,10.18520/cs/v118/i9/1448-1453,0.997283890589507,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995585272780877,0.00441472721912303,0.999999999998624,1.37634348362781e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
120,Endophytic Fungi from Alstonia boonei De Wild and Greenwayodendron suaveolens (Engl. and Diels) Verdc. subsp. Suaveolens Possess Inhibitory Activity against Pneumonia Causing Bacteria,"This study evaluated the antibacterial efficacy of methanolic extracts of isolated endophytic fungi from stem barks and leaves of Alstonia boonei De Wild and Greenwayodendron suaveolens (Engl. and Diels) Verdc. subsp. Suaveolens against Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 43816, Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 49247, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, responsible for causing pneumonia. The endophytic fungi were isolated and characterized in the Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA), Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA), and Czapek Dox Agar (CDA) media. The fungi and their methanolic extracts were tested for in vitro antibacterial potential by antagonistic assay for endophytic fungi against bacterial pathogens and microdilution method. The phytochemical screening of extracts was carried out according to the colorimetric and precipitation methods to reveal the presence of secondary metabolites. The results showed that 24 macroscopically and microscopically distinct endophytic fungi were isolated, identified, and stored. These endophytic fungi possessed antibacterial activity against the selected bacterial strains with inhibition zones ranging from 7.00 to 25.00 mm. The endophytic fungi GS(15) and AB(24) have presented the inhibitions zones of 20.33mm and 25.00 mm, respectively, and these were better than the ones obtained for Levofloxacin((R)). The endophytes with inhibition zones greater than 10mm were used for extraction of their secondary metabolites. The endophytic fungi extracts showed antibacterial activity with the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 6.25 Chi 10(-4) to 2 Chi 10(-2) g/L and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) ranging from 2.5 Chi 10(-3) to 2 Chi 10(-2) g/L. The endophytic fungi GS(15) extract was the most effective extract; it showed bactericidal effects on the tested bacterial strains. The phytochemical screening of the extracts revealed the presence of secondary metabolites classes, responsible for causing the obtained antibacterial activity. Thus, the endophytic fungi methanolic extracts from A. boonei and G. suaveolens have the potential to inhibit the growth of bacteria responsible for nosocomial pneumonia.","Demeni, PCE; Betote, PHD; Kom, CW; Tchamgoue, EN; Moni, EDN; Maniepi, JSF; Agbor, GA; Nyegue, MA",EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE,2021,10.1155/2021/9966323,0.990694930090586,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997788416278363,0.00221158372163706,0.999999980995398,1.90046023362811e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16705,Identification of the Fungal Endophyte Epichloe festucae in the Fine Fescue Festuca ampla.,"Festuca ampla is native to the Iberian Peninsula (4). Endophytic mycelium was observed by microscopy (2) in stem pith samples of two of eight asymptomatic plants of F. ampla collected in one population from a natural grassland in Salamanca, Spain. The fungus could be isolated (2) only from these two plants, and conidiophores and reniform conidia typical of Epichloe species (3) were observed in pure cultures. The two infected plants maintained in pots outside, developed ectostromata in some reproductive stems (choke disease) the year after the field sampling. Six seeds collected from an infected plant were germinated, and all six seedlings were found to be infected based on microscopy (2), implying seed transmission of the endophyte. These observations suggest that this is a pleiotropic symbiont, having both mutualistic and pathogenic states in its host. An ergovaline concentration of 120 ng/g dry weight was detected in a sample of leaves and leaf sheaths of an infected plant. All of the above characteristics are typical of the genus Epichloe, and in particular of the fine fescue endophyte E. festucae (1,3). To determine the species, internal transcribed spacer and 5.8-rDNA sequences as well as a partial sequence of the β-tubulin gene were obtained. These two sequences (EMBL Accession Nos. AJ488497 and AJ488498) showed 100% sequence homology to the corresponding sequences in E. festucae. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this endophyte species in the grass F. ampla.

14188,"The Purification and Characterization of Lipases from Lasiodiplodia theobromae, and Their Immobilization and Use for Biodiesel Production from Coconut Oil","The coconut kernel-associated fungus, Lasiodiplodia theobromae VBE1, was grown on coconut cake with added coconut oil as lipase inducer under solid-state fermentation conditions. The extracellular-produced lipases were purified and resulted in two enzymes: lipase A (68,000 Da)—purified 25.41-fold, recovery of 47.1%—and lipase B (32,000 Da)—purified 18.47-fold, recovery of 8.2%. Both lipases showed optimal activity at pH 8.0 and 35 °C, were activated by Ca2+, exhibited highest specificity towards coconut oil and p-nitrophenyl palmitate, and were stable in iso-octane and hexane. Ethanol supported higher lipase activity than methanol, and n-butanol inactivated both lipases. Crude lipase immobilized by entrapment within 4% (w/v) calcium alginate beads was more stable than the crude-free lipase preparation within the range pH 2.5–10.0 and 20–80 °C. The immobilized lipase preparation was used to catalyze the transesterification/methanolysis of coconut oil to biodiesel (fatty acyl methyl esters (FAMEs)) and was quantified by gas chromatography. The principal FAMEs were laurate (46.1%), myristate (22.3%), palmitate (9.9%), and oleate (7.2%), with minor amounts of caprylate, caprate, and stearate also present. The FAME profile was comparatively similar to NaOH-mediated transesterified biodiesel from coconut oil, but distinctly different to petroleum-derived diesel. This study concluded that Lasiodiplodia theobromae VBE1 lipases have potential for biodiesel production from coconut oil. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Venkatesagowda B.; Ponugupaty E.; Barbosa-Dekker A.M.; Dekker R.F.H.,Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology,2018,10.1007/s12010-017-2670-6,0.992762883130542,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.849022309531182,0.150977690468818,0.999997149887137,2.85011286305092e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
20554,Germinability and seedling vigour of physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.) seeds inoculated with seed-borne fungi,"Germinability and seedling vigour of physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.) seeds inoculated with Aspergillus flavus and Rhizopus nigricans were investigated in a germination chamber and in plastic pots in a screen house at Federal University of Technology (FUT), Minna. The seeds were pre-inoculated with the fungi for 72 h and 0 h before sowing and compared with those applied with Seedplus (R) 30WS fungicide. The experiment which involved completely randomised design had eight treatments in three replicates. It was confirmed in the germination chamber that seeds inoculated with A. flavus + R. nigricans for 72 h before sowing had the lowest percentage germination (20%) at 8 DAS while the uninoculated seeds (control) had the highest (87%). In the pot at 20 DAS, seeds applied with combined A. flavus and R. nigricans for 72 h before sowing had the least seedling vigour index (0.38) while the uninoculated control had the highest vigour index (1.89). Though the presence of A. flavus + R. nigricans on physic nut seeds adversely affected germination and seedling vigour, seed-dressing with Seedplus (R) significantly reduced the pathogenic effect of the fungi.

5626,Biocontrol of Rhizoctonia solani using volatile organic compounds of solanaceae seed-borne endophytic bacteria,"Rhizoctonia solani is a broad spectrum fungal pathogen that infects crops in greenhouse and field conditions causing plants damping-off and fruit rot which provoke serious yield losses. This study prospected the use of bacterial volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to control R. solani infection on tomato seedlings and fruit in order to search for an alternative to the use of chemical pesticides. Seed-born bacterial endophytes were isolated from the cultivated Solanum lycopersicum and the wild Solanum linnaeanum species. This study showed a host- and organ-specific colonization of endophytic bacteria at early seedling stage with most of them colonizes the cotyledons in comparison to stems and roots. Overall, 51 % and 11 % of isolated endophytic bacteria produce antifungal VOCs against R. solani at 7 d and 14 d of dual culture, respectively. The majority (about 78 %) of the antagonistic bacterial endophytes showed promoting activity on tomato seedling growth. For the bioprotection tests the strains TRC7 and TRC10 of Bacillus subtilis and TRT11 of B. megateriumwere selected as the most antagonistic and PGP endophytic bacteria and a non-antagonistic strain SMLR7 of Paenibacillus sp., with this later strain reported for the first time colonizing internal seed tissues of S. linnaeanum. The VOCs of the strain TRC7 showed the best pattern of decrease of R. solani rotting on tomato fruit, and increase the hypocotyl length, the radicle length, the fresh weight, and the vigor of tomato seedlings. The identification of the VOCs produced by the antagonistic Bacillus strains showed a core set of four compounds i.e. 2-Heptanone; Pyrazine, 2,5-dimethyl-; Naphthalene; and Benzenamine, N-ethyl- which was the most abundant. All the four VOCs showed antifungal activity against R. solani in vitro growth, and to our knowledge this activity is reported for the first time for Benzenamine, N-ethyl- and 2-Heptanone. The Benzenamine, N-ethyl- showed the best antifungal activity with an IC50 about 0.09 mL L-1 headspace and proved to be effective in reducing R. solani rotting on tomato fruit at the same concentration. So, this work provides evidence about VOCs-mediated biocontrol ability of Bacillus strains to reduce R. solani seedling damping-off and fruit rot of tomato making them valuable agents for pre- and postharvest control of this disease.","Marzouk, T; Chaouachi, M; Sharma, A; Jallouli, S; Mhamdi, R; Kaushik, N; Djébali, N",POSTHARVEST BIOLOGY AND TECHNOLOGY,2021,10.1016/j.postharvbio.2021.111655,0.97714982460398,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999990525629518,9.47437048215318e-6,0.999999999999679,3.2129854332652e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
8610,The Muscodor-Coffee Plant Interaction Promotes Vegetative Growth and Increases Coffee Plant Resistance to Leucoptera coffeella,"Endophytic fungi live harmoniously-associated with plants tissues, and usually offers benefits to the host. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 12 Muscodor isolates on Coffea arabica plants responses under coffee leaf miner (Leucoptera coffeella) infestation. Seeds of C. arabica, Catua & iacute; Vermelho (IAC 144), and Top & aacute;zio (MG 1190) cultivars were inoculated with the endophytic fungi, and were sown in pots with substrate and kept in a greenhouse. Six months after sowing, the greenhouse was infested with L. coffeella, and at 24 months the leaves enzymatic antioxidant activity and vegetative growth were evaluated. Plants inoculated with Muscodor showed less damage caused by the insect when compared to non-inoculated plants, due to the lowest activity of all enzymes in the control plants compared to inoculated plants, reflecting in lower lipid peroxidation. The highest activity of the enzyme superoxide dismutase was observed in the cultivars Catua & iacute; Vermelho and Top & aacute;zio when inoculated with Muscodor coffeanum (CML 4011 and CML 4020), respectively. Catua & iacute; Vermelho cultivar inoculated with M. coffeanum (CML 4014) and Muscodor sp.

Nitrogen (N) limits crop yield, and improvement of N nutrition remains a key goal for crop research; one approach to improve N nutrition is identifying plant-interacting, N-2-fixing microbes. Rhodotorula mucilaginosa JGTA-S1 is a basidiomycetous yeast endophyte of narrowleaf cattail (Typha angustifolia). JGTA-S1 could not convert nitrate or nitrite to ammonium but harbors diazotrophic (N-2-fixing) endobacteria (Pseudomonas stutzeri) that allow JGTA-S1 to fix N-2 and grow in a N-free environment; moreover, P. stutzeri dinitrogen reductase was transcribed in JGTA-S1 even under adequate N. Endobacteria-deficient JGTA-S1 had reduced fitness, which was restored by reintroducing P. stutzeri. JGTA-S1 colonizes rice (Oryza sativa), significantly improving its growth, N content, and relative N-use efficiency. Endofungal P. stutzeri plays a significant role in increasing the biomass and ammonium content of rice treated with JGTA-S1; also, JGTA-S1 has better N-2-fixing ability than free-living P. stutzeri and provides fixed N to the plant. Genes involved in N metabolism, N transporters, and NODULE INCEPTION-like transcription factors were upregulated in rice roots within 24 h of JGTA-S1 treatment. In association with rice, JGTA-S1 has a filamentous phase and P. stutzeri only penetrated filamentous JGTA-S1.

6961,Enzymatic potential and biosurfactant production by endophytic fungi from mangrove forest in Southeastern Brazil,"Microbial activity is the main route for cycling mangrove nutrients. In general, microorganisms have abilities to degrade lignocellulosic compounds. Among the biotechnological potential of the microbiota from mangroves, it is noteworthy about endophytic fungi, which can be considered as effective sources of different bioactive compounds. In this sense, thirty (30) endophytic fungi were isolated from mangrove forest sampling Cananeia, SP, Brazil. These microorganisms were analyzed about their enzymatic activities including: lignin peroxidase EC 1.11.1.14, manganese peroxidase EC 1.11.1.13 and laccase EC 1.10.3.2, as well endo-cellulase EC 3.2.1.4 and endo-xylanase EC 3.2.1.8.

17134,First Report of Alternaria alternata Causing Black Leaf Spot of Rubber Tree in China.,"We first reported Alternaria heveae (E.G. Simmons ) to be the pathogen that caused black leaf spot of rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis Muell. Arg) in Heikou county in July 2014 (1). Black leaf spots that resembled the symptoms caused by A. heveae were observed on the leaves of rubber trees of the whole propagule collection nursery in Jingping County (22°68' N and 103°05' E) of Yunnan Province. Black foliar spots (0.1 to 2 mm in diameter) surrounded by a yellow halo with lesions slightly sunken on the leaf surface were observed. To confirm whether the disease was caused by the same pathogen, 5-mm2 sections were removed from the leading edge of the lesion and were surface-sterilized in 75% ethanol, air-dried, plated on potato carrot agar (PCA), and incubated at 28°C in the dark. Colonies of the fungus on PCA had round margins and little aerial mycelia with gray-black coloration after 6 days of growth on PCA (2). Medium brown conidia were found to be in short chains of two to eight spores, ovoid, obclavate, and obpyriform, with or without a short conical or cylindrical-shaped apical beak. Conidia ranged from 22.5 to 67.5 μm long (mean 39.9 μm) × 10 to 15 μm wide (mean 12.5 μm; 100 colodia were measured), with three to six transverse septa and zero to three longitudinal or oblique septa. Morphological characteristics matched the descriptions of A. alternata [(Fries) Keissler] (4).The ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region of one single-spore isolate, Ah02JP1, was amplified with primers ITS1 and ITS4. The PCR product was sequenced directly and deposited in GenBank (Accession No. KM111289). A BLAST search of the GenBank database revealed 100% similarity with A. alternata isolates KJ829535.1, KJ677246.1, and KF813070.1. Therefore, the pathogen was identified as A. alternata on the basis of its morphological characteristics and ITS sequence. Pathogenicity of a representative isolate, Ah02JP1 was confirmed using a field rubber tree inoculation method. Three rubber plants (the clone of rubber tree Yunyan77-4) were grown to the copper-colored leaf stage. Leaves were spray-inoculated (104 conidia per milliliter spore suspension) until drops were equally distributed using a manual pressure sprayer. Three rubber plants sprayed with sterile distilled water were used as controls. After inoculation, the plants were covered with plastic bags to maintain high relative humidity. The plastic bags were removed 2 days post-inoculation (dpi), and the plants were monitored daily for symptom development. Five days post-inoculation, spots similar to the original ones seen on the field trees developed on all inoculated leaves, while control leaves remained symptomless. A. alternata was re-isolated from spray-inoculated leaves, confirming Koch's postulates. A. alternata has been reported as the causal agent of leaf blight of rubber tree in India, which initially appeared as minute spots on leaves and enlarged with the growth of the leaves (3). However, in the present study, the symptoms (black leaf spots) remained small over time after inoculation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of A. alternata on rubber tree in China. Correct identification of pathogens is essential for disease management strategies. This report will establish a foundation for the further study of Alternaria alternata to address the disease effectively. References: (1) Z. Y. Cai et al. Plant Dis. 98:1011, 2014. (2) E. Mirkova. J.

6028,Isolation and identification of the endophytic fungus J2-3 and its disease-preventive and growth-promoting effects on cucumber,"There are many problems that result from the use of a large number of chemical pesticides to control plant diseases, including pathogenic bacteria resistance, environmental contamination, and human health effects. Recently, endophytic fungi have become a significant source of bioactive fungicide products and an invaluable resource for excavating microbial pesticides. In this study, endophytic fungi with biocontrol potential were isolated and screened from Mikania micrantha leaves, stems, and roots. Fifty endophytic fungi were isolated and their antagonistic activity was studied in vitro using the confrontation culture method. The J2-3 strains from stems exhibit broad-spectrum and high activity. The strain's biological characteristics were determined by various culture conditions, and it was identified as Fusarium proliferatum by both morphological and ITS sequence analysis. Biological characteristics of the J2-3 strain were also tested. The optimum temperature for mycelium growth and sporulation was 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C, respectively. For mycelium growth, starch was the optimum carbon source, and peptone was the optimum nitrogen source for sucrose, mycelium growth, and sporulation. Mycelium growth was killed by a temperature of 60 degrees C, and sporulation was killed by a temperature of 55 degrees C. The light aided mycelium growth, and the light alternated between light and dark cycles for sporulation. Further, pot experiments were conducted to determine the antagonistic and viable effects of highly antagonistic strains on cucumber. The spore suspension's final control efficacy on cucumber wilt disease was up to 62.79% and it also promoted cucumber growth significantly. The results show that the entophytic fungus J2-3 from M. micrantha can protect cucumbers from wilt disease and promote growth.","Fu, JT; Wu, YJ; Yan, XN; Wang, LY; Zhang, SJ; Luo, YP",BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY,2023,10.1007/s42770-023-00979-3,0.987351800020275,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991660728289867,0.00833927171013259,0.999999988195949,1.18040512919748e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2615,"Biocontrol of early blight disease of eggplant using endophytic Aspergillus terreus: improving plant immunological, physiological and antifungal activities","Background The eggplant suffers from many biotic stresses that cause severe damage to crop production. One of the most destructive eggplant pathogens is Alternaria solani, which causes early blight disease. A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the role of fungal endophytes in protecting eggplant against early blight as well as in improving its growth performance. Results Endophytic Aspergillus terreus was isolated from Ocimum basilicum leaves and identified morphologically and genetically. In vitro, crude extract of endophytic A. terreus exhibited promising antifungal activity against A. solani where minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was 1.25 mg/ml. Severity of the disease and rate of protection from the disease were recorded. Vegetative growth indices, physiological resistance signs (photosynthetic pigments, carbohydrates, proteins, phenols, proline, malondialdehyde (MDA), antioxidant enzymes), and isozymes were estimated. Alternaria solani caused a highly disease severity (87.5%) and a noticeable decreasing in growth characteristics and photosynthetic pigments except for carotenoids. Also, infection with A. solani caused significant decreases in the contents of carbohydrate and protein by 29.94% and 10.52%, respectively. Infection with A. solani caused enhancement in phenolics (77.21%), free proline (30.56%), malondialdehyde (30.26%), superoxide dismutase (SOD) (125.47%), catalase (CAT) (125.93%), peroxidase (POD) (25.07%) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) (125.37%) compared to healthy plants. In contrast, the use of A. terreus on infected plants succeeded in recovering eggplants from the disease, as the disease severity was recorded (caused protection by 66.67%). Application of A. terreus either on healthy or infected eggplants showed several responses in number and density of peroxidase (POD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) isozymes. Conclusion It is necessary for us to address the remarkable improvement in the photosynthetic pigments, protein, carbohydrates, and enzymatic activity compared to infected control, which opens the way for more studies on the use of biocides as safe alternatives against fungal diseases.","Attia, MS; Hashem, AH; Badawy, AA; Abdelaziz, AM",BOTANICAL STUDIES,2022,10.1186/s40529-022-00357-6,0.949914019418791,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997599500758299,0.00240049924170113,0.999999941811665,5.81883347061662e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
13353,"Cultivar and endophyte effects on a root aphid, Aploneura lentisci, in perennial ryegrass","In a pot trial, fungal endophytes (Neotyphodium spp.) with different alkaloid profiles were investigated for their effects on numbers of a root aphid (Aploneura lentisci) in perennial ryegrass. Some endophytes were also tested in different cultivars (Nui, Samson and Impact). Two endophytes, AR37 and AR6, strongly suppressed root aphid numbers. Wild-type had fewer aphids than endophyte-free plants and AR1. Endophytes producing peramine only (AR1, AR12, AR22) and an endophyte producing peramine and lolitrem B (AR23) did not differ from endophyte-free. There were no cultivar by endophyte interactions but cultivar affected the strength of aphid response to Wild-type. Comparisons of alkaloid profiles suggest that ergovaline (in Wild-type and AR6) and epoxy-janthitrems (in AR37) may affect root aphids whereas peramine and lolitrem B do not. Differences in herbage dry weight of plants and a significant relationship between herbage dry weight and root aphid numbers indicated this aphid reduces the growth rate of plants.",Popay A.; Gerard P.J.,New Zealand Plant Protection,2007,10.30843/nzpp.2007.60.4624,0.991575744406521,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.960247886416425,0.0397521135835754,0.999999999768436,2.3156354611586502e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16956,First Report of Southern Blight Caused by Sclerotium rolfsii on Lily in China.,"Lily (Lilium spp.) is an economically important cut flower cultivated in China. The soilborne fungus, Sclerotium rolfsii, is a major pathogen on many plants. During July 2005, severe basal stem rot and bulb rot symptoms were observed on an oriental lily cultivar (Sorbonne) in some commercial fields in northern Kunming (China). Disease incidence ranged from 20 to 30% across fields. Leaves of infected plants were chlorotic initially. As the disease progressed, stems and bulbs rotted and plants wilted. In the presence of abundant moisture, a white mycelium occurred on infected tissues. White or light-to-dark brown sclerotia (1 to 3 mm in diameter) developed from mycelium. Fungal isolates from infected bulbs grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) produced white mycelia and 1- to 2-mm diameter dark brown sclerotia. Sclerotia were nearly round with smooth surfaces and distributed over the entire colony. Isolates were identified as S. rolfsii on the basis of mycelial characteristics and color, size, and distribution of sclerotia. Pathogenicity was tested in the greenhouse on oriental lily cv. Sorbonne grown in pots (1 plant per pot, five replicates). Inoculum that consisted of 1 g per pot of wheat kernels infested with mycelium and sclerotia was placed at the base of each inoculated plant. Five noninoculated plants served as controls. The inoculation trial was repeated once. After inoculation, all plants were covered with a polyethylene bag for 72 h and kept at temperatures ranging between 25 and 27°C. Inoculated plants developed symptoms of leaf yellowing within 12 days, soon followed by the appearance of white mycelium and sclerotia, and then eventually wilted. Control plants remained symptomless. S. rolfsii was reisolated from inoculated plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of southern blight caused by S. rolfsii on lily in China. Infection of lily bulbs by S. rolfsii may cause losses in production fields in China, and the presence of infected bulbs may also interfere with bulb shipment.",Yang XM; Wang JH; Qu SP; Wang LH,Plant disease,2007,10.1094/PD-91-0109C,0.910501964419293,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.949475818408621,0.0505241815913793,0.999999997027733,2.9722669880882803e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

19730,Antifungal potential against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary and plant growth promoting abilities of Bacillus isolates from canola (Brassica napus L.) roots.,"Endophytic bacteria show important abilities in promoting plant growth and suppressing phytopathogens, being largely explored in agriculture as biofertilizers or biocontrol agents. Bacteria from canola roots were isolated and screened for different plant growth promotion (PGP) traits and biocontrol of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Thirty isolates belonging to Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Lysinibacillus, and Microbacterium genera were obtained. Several isolates produced auxin, siderophores, hydrolytic enzymes, fixed nitrogen and solubilized phosphate. Five isolates presented antifungal activity against S. sclerotiorum by the dual culture assay and four of them also inhibited fungal growth by volatile organic compounds production. All antagonistic isolates belonged to the Bacillus genus, and had their genomes sequenced for the search of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGC) related to antimicrobial metabolites. These isolates were identified as Bacillus safensis (3), Bacillus pumilus (1), and Bacillus megaterium (1), using the genomic metrics ANI and dDDH. Most strains showed several common BGCs, including bacteriocin, polyketide synthase (PKS), and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), related to pumilacidin, bacillibactin, bacilysin, and other antimicrobial compounds. Pumilacidin-related mass peaks were detected in acid precipitation extracts through MALDI-TOF analysis.

10048,Comprehensive profiling of the VOCs of Trichoderma longibrachiatum EF5 while interacting with Sclerotium rolfsii and Macrophomina phaseolina,"Trichoderma longibrachiatum EF5 is an endophytic fungal antagonist of rice. It is used for the control of soil-borne fungal pathogens-Sclerotium rolfsii and Macrophomina phaseolina. We demonstrate that T. longibrachiatum EF5 inhibits the growth of these pathogens on direct interaction as well as via the production of the microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs). The mVOCs reduced mycelial growth and inhibited the production of sclerotia by altering the mycelial structure. We profiled 138 mVOCs, when T. longibrachiatum EF5 interacted with the two pathogens. During these interactions, several compounds are up- or downregulated by T. longibrachiatum EF5, including longifolene, caryophyllene,1-Butanol 2-methyl, cedrene, and cuprenene. These compounds are involved in the biosynthetic pathways of the sesquiterpenoid and alkane, and the degradation pathway of trimethylamine. We provide an insight into the multiple modes by which T. longibrachiatum EF5 exerts antagonistic actions, such as hyperparasitism, competitions, and antibiosis via mVOCs. In contrast to their antimicrobial properties, these metabolites could also promote plant growth.","Sridharan, AP; Thankappan, S; Karthikeyan, G; Uthandi, S",MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH,2020,10.1016/j.micres.2020.126436,0.97039286790826,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.910010624102322,0.0899893758976783,0.999994277508072,5.72249192809515e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Three selected fungal isolates including Cladosporium sphaerospermum, Cochliobolus lunata and Cochliobolus sp.were used for the reduction of C. procera dried leaves powder toxicity. Sporulation of each of these fungi was increased in the presence of 2 g more than 1 g of dried leaves powder in PDB media at 25 degrees C within 4 weeks of incubation. Also, C. sphaerospermum, Cochliobolus sp., and C. lunata were tested for their ability to reduce the toxicity of C. procera dried leaves powder by using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Only C. sphaerospermum showed the ability to reduce the Calactin toxin presented in powdered leaves Furthermore, the toxicity test of dried leaves powder treated by C. sphaerospermum showed significant (100%) survival of the adult earthworm Lumbricusrubellus compared to the negative control, which induced 100% mortality of worms. These results were also comparable with C. sphaerospermum powdered mycelium, which showed no signs of toxicity.

1831,Visualising confirmation of the endophytic relationship of Metarhizium anisopliae with maize roots using molecular tools and fluorescent labelling,"Metarhizium anisopliae, an entomopathogenic fungus, is found to contribute to plant nutrient uptake and condidered as a plant endophyte. However, there is very little visual evidence that demonstratrates the endophytic relationship. Since the incidence of Metarhizium within host plants may be ephemeral or of limited distribution within host tissue, visualisation is reliant on both presence and the ability to detect the fungus even when present at low levels. We inoculated maize seeds with an egfp-labelled isolate of M. anisopliae, and then detected the egfp fragment by qualitative and quantitative PCR, and examined fluorescence of mycelia in the inoculated roots by laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM). The optimised PCR qualitatively identified the presence of egfp-labelled M. anisopliae at a 1:3000 M. anisopliae-maize DNA ratio. Root samplings of inoculated plants at intervals over 24 days were discovered egfp-labelled fragments with 14-d roots having the highest proportion with amplification. The egfp-label concentrations ranged very low in 2.976 x 10(-7.42 similar to-7.02) ng/mu L, with a rise process in 4-11 days after M. anisopliae treatment. Under LSCM, fluorescent mycelia in roots were identified, and the clear images were captured to show hyphal development extending along a longitudinal line of root cells and even forming a hyphal mass in the intercellular space. There were many hyphae at the branch junctions of the lateral roots.

14792,Plant extract control of the fungi associated with different Egyptian wheat cultivars grains,"Grain samples of 14 Egyptian wheat cultivars were tested for seed-borne fungi. The deep freezing method was used. Five seed-borne fungi viz., Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Curvularia lunata, Fusarium moniliforme and Penicillium chrysogenum were isolated from the wheat cultivars viz., Bani Suef 4, Bani Suef 5, Gemmiza 7, Gemmiza 9, Gemmiza 10, Giza 168, Misr 1, Misr 2, Sakha 93, Sakha 94, Shandaweel 1, Sids 1, Sids 2 and Sids 3. A. flavus, A. niger and F. moniliforme were the most prevalent fungal species. Their incidence ranged from 21.0-53.5%, 16.0-37.5%, and 12.0-31.0%, respectively. The antifungal potential of water extracts from aerial parts of five wild medicinal plants (Asclepias sinaica, Farsetia aegyptia, Hypericum sinaicum, Phagnalon sinaicum, and Salvia aegyptiaca) were collected from the Sinai Peninsula, Egypt. The antifungal potential of water extracts from the aerial parts of these five plants were tested in the laboratory against the dominant fungi isolated from the wheat cultivars. All the aqueous plant extracts significantly (p ≤ 0.05) reduced the incidence of the tested seed-borne fungi. But the extract of Asclepias sinaica exhibited the most antifungal activity on tested fungi at all concentrations used when compared with other plant extracts. Maximum infested grain germination was observed in Giza 168 and minimum in Bani Suef 5. Treating grains with plant extract of A. sinaica (10%) enhanced the percentage of grain germination of all cultivars in both laboratory and pot experiments. Maximum root and shoot length of seedlings was recorded in Bani Suef 4 during fungal infestation or treatment by plant extract. For one hour before sowing or storage, the aqueous extract of A. sinaica can be used to treat wheat grains, to reduce the fungal incidence. Aqueous extracts of the aerial parts of selected medicinal plants, particularly A. sinaica, are promising for protecting Egyptian wheat grain cultivars against major seed-borne fungi. The aqueous extracts are expected to improve crops. © by Zakaria Awad Mohamed Baka 2014.",Mohamed Baka Z.A.,Journal of Plant Protection Research,2014,10.2478/jppr-2014-0035,0.962512182339103,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.861402275938724,0.138597724061276,0.999999997934532,2.0654680188414403e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
5002,Endophytic Bacteria from Ocimum sanctum and Their Yield Enhancing Capabilities,"Endophytes are beneficial microbes that reside intercellularly inside the plants. Interaction of endophytes with the host plants and their function within their host are important to address ecological relevance of endophyte. Four endophytic bacteria OS-9, OS-10, OS-11, and OS-12 were isolated from healthy leaves of Ocimum sanctum. These isolated microbes were screened in dual culture against various phytopathogenic fungi viz. Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotium rolfsii, Fusarium solani, Alternaria solani, and Colletotrichum lindemuthianum. Of these, strain OS-9 was found to be antagonistic to R. solani, A. solani, F. solani, and C. lindemuthianum while OS-11 was found antagonistic against A. solani only. The growth-promoting benefits of the endophytes were initially evaluated in the glasshouse by inoculated seeds of O. sanctum. Treatment with endophytes OS-10 and OS-11 resulted in significant enhancement of growth as revealed by increase in fresh as well as dry weight. Further, field trials involving two genotypes OS Purple and CIM-Angana were conducted with strains OS-10 and OS-11. The growth-promoting effect was visible on both the genotypes tested as the endophytes significantly enhanced fresh herbage yield (t/ha). Interestingly, these endophytes increased the content of essential oil particularly in cultivar OS Purple and thereby increasing the total oil yields. Molecular characterization of strain OS-11 indicated the strain to be highly related to the type strain of Bacillus subtilis.","Tiwari, R; Kalra, A; Darokar, MP; Chandra, M; Aggarwal, N; Singh, AK; Khanuja, SPS",CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY,2010,10.1007/s00284-009-9520-x,0.802984930218957,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999773779439535,2.2622056046501e-4,0.999999999928078,7.1922245936662e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2314,Culture of the upper littoral zone marine alga Pseudendoclonium submarinum induces pathogenic interaction with the fungus Cladosporium cladosporioides,"The green marine alga Pseudendoclonium submarinum (Willie 1901) occurs on hard substratum in the upper littoral in the North Atlantic Ocean. In recent field and laboratory studies, Pseudendoclonium submarinum grew normally in situ but declined in vitro. Microscopic examination showed the alga inoculum to be associated with a filamentous fungus, where the fungus grew in close association with the alga. Pseudendoclonium samples collected from Ipswich, MA during a two-year period were consistently associated with the fungus. In cultures with the fungus present, algal thalli declined and became necrotic, while the fungus produced hyphae and conidia. The fungus failed to grow in sterile algal medium in the absence of Pseudendoclonium but could be isolated and grown on standard mycological culture media. Light and scanning electron microscopy showed fungal hyphae infiltrated intercellular areas of the algal filaments but did not penetrate algal cell walls. Pathogenicity is apparently a result of the in vitro environment, and it is hypothesized that the fungus produces one or more secondary metabolites, which accumulate in culture. These metabolites produced by the fungus eventually killed algal cells. Fungal ribosomal DNA sequences were compared to Cladasporium sp. in GenBank, indicating that the fungus is Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fresenius) de Vries. Widely distributed, Cladosporium cladasporioides has been shown to be a facultative parasite, endophyte and saprophyte on terrestrial plants and some algae. The fungus has not been described in association with an ulvophyte, a green marine alga.","Cooley, DR; Mullins, RF; Bradley, PM; Wilce, RT",PHYCOLOGIA,2011,10.2216/10-84.1,0.965152085982922,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999757422425905,2.4257757409459e-4,0.99999999076644,9.23356024973288e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
4622,EPICHLOE-TYPHINA FROM TOXIC TALL FESCUE GRASSES,"E. typhina, a clavicipitaceous systemic phytopathogen, was isolated from 2 varieties and 3 hybrids of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea). The morphology of the fescue isolates was compared with E. typhina isolated from bent grass (Agrostis perennans). In all isolates, conidia were identical and were typical of E. typhina. In fescue grasses the endophyte failed to produce stromata, but on bent grass the fungus seasonally produced stromata, typical of the genus. Cattle grazing the fescue grasses showed signs of the fescue toxicity syndrome, the E. typhina was found in frequencies of 100%; in grasses from pastures in which cattle showed no signs of the syndrome, frequencies were 0-50%. Nutritional factors in vitro were more complex for the isolates from fescue than for the isolate from bent grass. These studies suggested that E. typhina includes biotypes that might be involved in the toxicity syndrome. The fescue biotypes grew poorly on media, and yields were inadequate for toxicity studies. The bent grass isolate grew well on 3 media, and extracts from 2 of these were toxic to chicken embryos. All isolates produced in vitro the nontoxic fungal steroid tetraenone [ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one], which has been isolated from toxic fescue grasses.","BACON, CW; PORTER, JK; ROBBINS, JD; LUTTRELL, ES",APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,1977,10.1128/AEM.34.5.576-581.1977,0.876736679905264,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997944596462277,0.00205540353772296,0.999999999999434,5.65991697953905e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
14801,Alternative methods to control Phytophthora cactorum in strawberry cultivated in soilless growing media,"Phytophthora cactorum is an important threat in strawberry propagation and production. No reliable non-chemical control measures are available. Therefore different control strategies were tested. Spread of pathogen infection can be reduced by disinfection of the irrigation water. Slow sand filtration effectively removed P. cactorum from drain water, i.e., disease severity in strawberry plants was reduced with 45 to 65% and rhododendron baits showed a 95-100% reduction of P. cactorum after the drain water had passed the sand filter. However, upstream movement of P. cactorum was detected within the unit. A complementary strategy to reduce the damage caused by P. cactorum is to enhance disease suppressive properties of the soilless substrate. Pasteurization of the substrate mixtures showed increased levels of disease, indicating that biological factors might play a role in disease suppression. Antagonistic bacteria inhibiting growth of P. cactorum were present in roots, rhizosphere as well as in the crown. However, compost amendment or other additions did not elevate suppressiveness. Further experiments were performed where different beneficial microorganisms and/or elicitors were added.

5307,A diverse assemblage of Botryosphaeriaceae infect Eucalyptus in native and non-native environments,"The Botryosphaeriaceae cause endophytic infections of leaves and bark of various trees, including Eucalyptus, and they apparently persist in this state for extended periods of time. Under conditions of stress, these fungi cause many different disease symptoms on Eucalyptus, of which stem and branch cankers and die-back are the most prominent. Given their cryptic, endophytic nature, the Botryosphaeriaceae are easily overlooked when moving seeds and plants around the world. It is, therefore, not surprising to see a growing number of examples of introductions of Botryosphaeriaceae into new environments. In the past, three species were commonly reported from Eucalyptus, namely Botryosphaeria dothidea, Neofusicoccum ribis ( reported as B. ribis) and Lasiodiplodia theobromae. It is now known that B. dothidea and N. ribis are generally rare on Eucalyptus, and that Aplosporella yalgorensis, B. mamane, N. parvum, N. eucalyptorum, N. eucalypticola, N. australe, N. macroclavatum, N. andinum, N. mangiferum, Dichomera eucalypti, Dichomera versiformis, Fusicoccum ramosum, Pseudofusicoccum stromaticum, P. adansoniae, P. ardesiarum, P. kimberleyense, Lasiodiplodia crassispora, L. gonubiensis, L. pseudotheobromae and L. rubropurpurea also infect this host. Interestingly, different species dominate on Eucalyptus in different regions of the world, irrespective of whether other species occur in that environment or not. As examples, in parts of eastern Australia, N. eucalyptorum and N. eucalypticola dominate, although N. australe is common on Acacia spp. in this area, while in Western Australia N. australe dominates. In South Africa and Chile N. parvum, N. eucalyptorum and N. eucalypticola are common, despite the presence of N. ribis and N. australe on related hosts such as Syzygium. In Venezuela, there are five other species not common on Eucalyptus elsewhere, but L. theobromae dominates. In Colombia, B. dothidea and N. ribis, and in Uganda and Ethiopia, L. theobromae and N. parvum, are most common. These fascinating patterns of distribution are explored, while their pathogenicity and potential influence on Eucalyptus plantations and surrounding native plant communities are considered.","Slippers, B; Burgess, T; Pavlic, D; Ahumada, R; Maleme, H; Mohali, S; Rodas, C; Wingfield, MJ",SOUTHERN FORESTS-A JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE,2009,10.2989/SF.2009.71.2.3.818,0.995210376560137,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.984684086840034,0.0153159131599662,0.999999997676244,2.32375607644997e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12069,Fungal Presence and Changes of Wood Structure in Bark Stripping Wounds Made by Red Deer (Cervus elaphus L.) on Stems of Fraxinus angustifolia (Vahl),"Narrow-leaved ash (Fraxinus angustifolia Vahl), a highly valued European forest tree species, has been severely affected by a large-scale decline, which is most probably driven by a complex of multiple interacting factors including fungi, which contribute to and accelerate this process. Red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) can be considered as one of the contributing factors, as they inflict damage on the stems of young trees by stripping the bark. These wounds not only represent suitable entry points for fungi which can cause tissue necroses and decomposition, they can lead to changes in the wood structure as well. The aims of this research were to analyze chosen parameters of bark stripping wounds in narrow-leaved ash stands, identify fungi present in the tissue exposed by wounding, and inspect the effect of wounding on the wood structure. Bark stripping was observed on ash trees from 2 cm up to 18 cm of DBH and between 0.1 m and 1.9 m of stem height. The most susceptible trees were those with an average DBH of 5 +/- 2.5 cm. On most of the ash trees (51%), one-third to two-thirds of the circumference was damaged. In wounded tissue, 174 fungal isolates were found, most of which belonged to known endophytic fungi from the genera Trichoderma, Fusarium, and Clonostachys. It was observed that earlywood cells in the wounding zone had narrower lumens compared to ones in adjacent healthy zone with regard to different trees and stem heights.","Orlovic, JK; Diminic, D; Istok, I; Volenec, I; Hodak, L; Grubesic, M; Tomljanovic, K",FORESTS,2024,10.3390/f15020314,0.988677396275844,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.969308782893965,0.0306912171060349,0.999999880033292,1.19966708123087e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
852,"Evidence for a Dark Septate Endophyte (Exophiala Pisciphila, H93) Enhancing Phosphorus Absorption by Maize Seedlings","Background and aims Dark septate endophytes (DSE) are a group of multifunctional fungi that ubiquitously colonize the roots of numerous plants worldwide, benefiting the nutrition and adaptation of hosts to various stressed environments. How DSE benefit phosphorus absorption by their host plants remains unclear. Methods We established pot cultures and compartmentalized microcosms in the greenhouse and used transcriptomic analysis to examine the response of maize to inoculation with a DSE strain, Exophiala pisciphila H93, which has been found to be capable of promoting plant growth and enhancing the tolerance of maize to heavy metals. Results H93 promoted the biomass, phosphorus absorption and photosynthesis of inoculated maize by enhancing phosphorus enzyme activities in the rhizosphere and by decreasing the pH of the rhizosphere compared with non-inoculated controls, either in sufficient or deficient phosphorus conditions in pot cultures. H93 inoculation changed the transcriptional pattern of maize related to 8 metabolic pathways. While H93 did not induce particular phosphate transporter gene expression under deficient phosphorus conditions, it dissolved the sparingly soluble phosphates (tricalcium phosphate) in the rhizosphere. Conclusions Enhanced phosphorus absorption by the host plant by DSE (H93) seemed to occur independently of DSE-induced genes involved in phosphorus absorption. The greatest contribution of DSE to phosphorus utilization of hosts might be their efficiency in transferring sparingly soluble phosphorus into soluble phosphate (Pi).","Xu, RB; Li, T; Shen, M; Yang, ZL; Zhao, ZW",PLANT AND SOIL,2020,10.1007/s11104-020-04538-9,0.983164139157771,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999367555854932,6.324441450681e-4,0.999999463711419,5.36288581209909e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Desm. f. sp. tritici Eriks. Treated seedlings of the near-isogenic wheat line Lr2 exhibited no macroscopic evidence of leaf rust 10 days after inoculation. Urediospore germination and subsequent stomatal penetration were not affected by the seed treatment. Plants from treated seed had fewer and shorter infection hyphae and fewer haustoria per infection site 12 h after inoculation than did the controls, but the differences were not significant until 36 h after inoculation. The antifungal activity of Indar also was exhibited by swollen, distorted hyphae in leaves of treated plants. Beyond 36 h, fungal development was almost completely inhibited. Indar appeared to restrict continued development of existing infection structures as well as the formation of new structures. The inhibitory effect of the test compound was not accompanied by necrosis in either the host or the pathogen, suggesting that the mechanism of this control differs from the hypersensitive form of rust resistance.","WATKINS, JE; LITTLEFIELD, LJ; STATLER, GD",PHYTOPATHOLOGY,1977,NA,0.649281073307941,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.980019823296173,0.0199801767038271,0.999991282405632,8.71759436793518e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

3831,Muscodor albus Volatiles Control Toxigenic Fungi under Controlled Atmosphere (CA) Storage Conditions,"Muscodor albus, a biofumigant fungus, has the potential to control post-harvest pathogens in storage. It has been shown to produce over 20 volatile compounds with fungicidal, bactericidal and insecticidal properties. However, M. albus is a warm climate endophyte, and its biofumigant activity is significantly inhibited at temperatures below 5 degrees C. Conidia of seven mycotoxin producing fungi, Aspergillus carbonarius, A. flavus, A. niger, A. ochraceus, Penicillium verrucosum, Fusarium culmorum and F. graminearum, were killed or prevented from germinating by exposure to volatiles from 2 g M. albus-colonized rye grain per L of headspace in sealed glass jars for 24 h at 20 degrees C. Two major volatiles of M. albus, isobutyric acid (IBA) and 2-methyl-1-butanol (2MB) at 50 mu L/L and 100 mu L/L, respectively, gave differential control of the seven fungi when applied individually at 20 degrees C. When the fungi were exposed to both IBA and 2MB together, an average of 94% of the conidia were killed or suppressed. In a factorial experiment with controlled atmosphere storage (CA) at 3 degrees C and 72 h exposure to four concentrations of IBA and 2MB combinations, 50 mu L/L IBA plus 100 mu L/L 2MB killed or suppressed germination of the conidia of all seven fungi. Controlled atmosphere had no significant effect on conidial viability or volatile efficacy. Major volatiles of M. albus may have significant potential to control plant pathogens in either ambient air or CA storage at temperatures below 5 degrees C. However, combinations of volatiles may be required to provide a broader spectrum of control than individual volatiles.","Braun, G; Vailati, M; Prange, R; Bevis, E",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES,2012,10.3390/ijms131215848,0.986063995214285,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999916836559709,8.31634402915111e-5,1,3.33066907387547e-16,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
13438,Scanning electron microscopy of some endophytic streptomycetes in snakevine - Kennedia nigricans,"Soils of all types and locations have generally served as the major sources of streptomycetous bacteria. These organisms are the source of nearly 80% of the world's antibiotics. Now, it is realized that Streptomyces spp. (within the group of prokaryotic filamentous bacteria known as actinomycetes) can exist as endophytes within the interstices of some higher plants. While it is sometimes possible to isolate one or two different streptomycetes from certain plants, most plants are free of these organisms. However, the snakevine (Kennedia nigricans) of the Northern Territory of Australia has yielded at least 39 different endophytic actinomycetes (95 % of them being Streptomyces spp.) Most of these isolates possessed no detectable antibiotic properties, while at least seven had antibacterial and antifungal activities. Examination of eight selected cultures by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as well as environmental scanning electron microcopy (FEI ESEM FEG) (FEI Company, Hillsobro, Ore., USA) revealed unusual patterns, structures, and features of the spores and hyphae of these microorganisms. For instance, as revealed by ESEM FEG for the first time, it has become obvious that extremely fine hair-like structures (average 25-49 nm with gold-coated specimens) exist on the spores and hyphae of some endophytic streptomycetes. The biological purpose of these hair-like protrusions is unknown. Both SEM and ESEM FEG can be effectively used as tools in identification and elucidation of the biology of these organisms. In addition, unusual colony morphology, observed with the unaided eye can very easily be used to distinguish some of these isolates since characteristic donut and pseudo-horn shaped colonies appeared in culture. © FAMS, Inc.",Castillo U.; Myers S.; Browne L.; Strobel G.; Hess W.M.; Hanks J.; Reay D.,Scanning,2005,10.1002/sca.4950270606,0.93811181322686,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996693202209577,0.00330679779042302,0.999997748428165,2.25157183531e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The biotransformation process is considered as an efficient strategy for GAMG production, due to its mild reaction, high production efficiency and environmentally friendly status. In this study, licorice straw was used for the first time as a medium for GAMG and lignocellulosic enzyme production via solid-state fermentation (SSF) of endophytic fungus Chaetomium globosum DX-THS3. The fermentation conditions including particle size, temperature, seed age, inoculum size, and moisture of substrate were optimized. Furthermore, additional nitrogen sources and carbon sources were screened for GAMG production by C. globosum DX-THS3 of SSF. Under optimal fermentation conditions, the percent conversion of glycyrrhizin reached 90% in 15 days, whereas the control needed 35 days to achieve the same result. The productivity of optimization (P = 2.1 mg/g/day) was 2.33-fold that of non-optimization (P = 0.9 mg/g/day). Meanwhile, high activities of filter paper enzyme (FPase) (245.80 U/g), carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase) (33.67 U/g), xylanase (83.44 U/g), and beta-glucuronidase activity (271.42 U/g) were obtained faster than those in the control during SSF.

21359,Two bacterial entophytes eliciting both plant growth promotion and plant defense on pepper (Capsicum annuum L.).,"Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) have the potential to be used as microbial inoculants to reduce disease incidence and severity and to increase crop yield. Some of the PGPR have been reported to be able to enter plant tissues and establish endophytic populations. Here, we demonstrated an approach to screen bacterial endophytes that have the capacity to promote the growth of pepper seedlings and protect pepper plants against a bacterial pathogen. Initially, out of 150 bacterial isolates collected from healthy stems of peppers cultivated in the Chungcheong and Gyeongsang provinces of Korea, 23 putative endophytic isolates that were considered to be predominating and representative of each pepper sample were selected. By phenotypic characterization and partial 16S rDNA sequence analysis, the isolates were identified as species of Ochrobacterium, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas, Janthinobacterium, Ralstonia, Arthrobacter, Clavibacter, Sporosarcina, Acidovorax, and Brevundimonas. Among them, two isolates, PS4 and PS27, were selected because they showed consistent colonizing capacity in pepper stems at the levels of 10(6)-10(7) CFU/g tissue, and were found to be most closely related to Pseudomonas rhodesiae and Pantoea ananatis, respectively, by additional analyses of their entire 16S rDNA sequences. Drenching application of the two strains on the pepper seedlings promoted significant growth of peppers, enhancing their root fresh weight by 73.9% and 41.5%, respectively. The two strains also elicited induced systemic resistance of plants against Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vesicatoria.",Kang SH; Cho HS; Cheong H; Ryu CM; Kim JF; Park SH,Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,2007,NA,0.961869222819386,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.818370203533216,0.181629796466784,0.999973809068703,2.61909312974096e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
12704,Phytochemicals induced in chickpea roots selectively and non-selectively stimulate and suppress fungal endophytes and pathogens,"Plant roots shape the structure of the soil microbiome by producing a wide array of phytochemicals, which in turn impact plant growth and health. The synthesis of root metabolites is a dynamic process that is modulated by interactions with soil microorganisms. This study explored the regulation of soil-borne fungal endophytes and pathogens by the production of phytochemicals in chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) roots colonized or not colonized by the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. Proteins and low-molecular-mass phytochemicals were extracted from chickpea roots and fractionated by flash chromatography and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The effects of these metabolites on the soil-borne fungal endophytes Trichoderma harzianum and Geomyces vinaceus and on the pathogens Fusarium oxysporum and Rhizoctonia solani were tested in 96-well plate assays. One protein fraction from the AM roots, which contained an apparent 34 KDa chitinase/chitin-binding domain and 24 KDa non-specific lipid transfer protein, non-selectively repressed the fungal endophytes and pathogens. By contrast to the protein fraction, the low-molecular-mass fractions were often selective. Eighteen fractions stimulated specific fungal species and seven fractions inhibited others. Several protein and low-molecular-mass phytochemicals in chickpea roots influence fungal endophytes. The difference in the response of fungal species to the phytochemicals suggests that these metabolites could be involved in the so called host 'preference' of fungal endophytes or 'resistance' to pathogens. This research reveals that the majority of the bioactive root metabolites could be involved in the selective association of chickpea and fungal endophytes while a few compounds provided resistance by suppressing the pathogenic species.","Bazghaleh, N; Hamel, C; Gan, YT; Knight, JD; Vujanovic, V; Cruz, AF; Ishii, T",PLANT AND SOIL,2016,10.1007/s11104-016-2977-z,0.633070237807706,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.377923065723142,0.622076934276858,0.997452809855075,0.00254719014492455,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
14764,Biodiversity of endophytic bacteria as a promising biotechnological resource,"Endophytic called bacteria are those colonizing the internal tissues of plants without causing disease and not rendering negative influence on its development. There are great prospects for search, selection and study of new species of endophytic bacteria, improving the development of plants, with the aim of creating new microbial preparations for adaptive crop production. Since bacterial endophytes colonize the same ecological niches in the plant as phytopathogenic microorganisms, they are a promising agent for biocontrol of phytopathogens. Classical studies of biodiversity of endophytic bacteria based on a characterization of isolates obtained from internal plant tissues after surface sterilization. Endophytic bacteria are able to improve phosphorus nutrition of plants, to produce IAA and siderophores. It is shown that endophytic bacteria are capable of producing vitamins, have a number of additional properties necessary for the improvement of plant development, such as: regulation of osmotic pressure, regulation of stomata, modification of root development of plants, regulation of nitrogen nutrition of plants. Endophytic bacteria are able to reduce or prevent the negative effects of pathogenic microorganisms on plants. Inoculation of plants by endophytic bacteria is able to significantly reduce the harm caused to plants by pathogenic fungi, bacteria, viruses, insects and nematodes. Unique strains of endophytic bacteria can be used directly for inoculation of seeds or seedlings, reducing, thus, the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on the plant, due to the active colonization of internal tissues of plants and subsequent positive biochemical and physiological effect on the plant. While in endosphere, endophytes have a significant advantage over organisms that live in the rhizosphere and phyllosphere due to the stable pH, humidity, flow of nutrients and lack of competition from a large number of microorganisms. For the inoculation of plants with endophytic bacteria do not require large amounts of inoculum, taking into account high specificity of such plant-microbe symbiosis and competitiveness of endophytic bacteria.

1094,Do fungivores trigger the transfer of protective metabolites from host plants to arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphae?,"A key objective in ecology is to understand how cooperative strategies evolve and are maintained in species networks. Here, we focus on the tri-trophic relationship between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, host plants, and fungivores to ask if host plants are able to protect their mutualistic mycorrhizal partners from being grazed. Specifically, we test whether secondary metabolites are transferred from hosts to fungal partners to increase their defense against fungivores. We grew Plantago lanceolata hosts with and without mycorrhizal inoculum, and in the presence or absence of fungivorous springtails. We then measured fungivore effects on host biomass and mycorrhizal abundance (using quantitative PCR) in roots and soil. We used high-performance liquid chromatography to measure host metabolites in roots, shoots, and hyphae, focusing on catalpol, aucubin, and verbascoside. Our most striking result was that the metabolite catalpol was consistently found in AM fungal hyphae in host plants exposed to fungivores. When fungivores were absent, catalpol was undetectable in hyphae. Our results highlight the potential for plant-mediated protection of the mycorrhizal hyphal network.","Duhamel, M; Pel, R; Ooms, A; Bücking, H; Jansa, J; Ellers, J; van Straalen, NM; Wouda, T; Vandenkoornhuyse, P; Kiers, ET",ECOLOGY,2013,10.1890/12-1943.1,0.989846693557518,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998094072746983,0.00190592725301745,0.999999999996439,3.5612623960901098e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11794,Colonization of Serendipita indica enhances resistance against Phoma arachidicola in Arachis hypogaea L,"The endophytic fungus Serendipita indica (Si) could suppress Phoma arachidicola (Pa) and control peanut web blotch disease. The study evaluated its growth-promoting and disease-resistant effects in two peanut cultivars, Luhua11 and Baisha1016. In vitro experiments and microscopy analysis demonstrated that S. indica suppressed the growth of P. arachidicola. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy illustrated that S. indica adversely affected the pathogen's hyphae. LSi treatment showed the highest stem height (35 cm), root length (15.533 cm), shoot fresh weight (9.33 g), shoot dry weight (1.30085 g), root dry weight (0.1990 g), and chlorophyll a (1.3253) and b (1.8316), while BPa had the lowest values of these parameters. The highest MDA value was observed at 96 h for BPa with (3.14598 nmol/g), and the highest proline value was observed at 72 h for LSi-Pa with (56.42851 mu mol/g). Antioxidant enzymes, catalase, peroxidase, ascorbate peroxidase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, increased significantly after 48 h in cultivar L. The most significant result is observed in salicylic acid with LSi-Pa at 72 h (702.10 mu g/mL), showing a consistent significant difference. RNA-seq analysis revealed more pronounced transcriptomic changes in cultivar L, with enriched pathways related to flavonoid biosynthesis and defense responses. The LSi-Pa treatment significantly upregulated gene expression at 96 h, with AhNPR1 (0.05807), AhNPR10 (0.10536), AhPAL1 (4.30831), and Ahcapx (0.22074), demonstrating a strong regulatory effect. These results demonstrate that S. indica enhances peanut plant growth and resilience against P. arachidicola, mainly through modulation of oxidative stress and immune responses.","Wang, C; Ahsan, T; Ding, A; Han, D; Gao, J; Liang, CH; Du, ST; Wei, Y; Huang, YQ; Zhang, SH",WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY,2025,10.1007/s11274-024-04244-z,0.954187326304327,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.971111497288665,0.0288885027113355,0.999999964030348,3.59696518126285e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10652,Characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Quorum Sensing Inhibitors from the Endophyte Lasiodiplodia venezuelensis and Evaluation of Their Antivirulence Effects by Metabolomics,"The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the ""critical priority pathogens"" due to its multidrug resistance to a wide range of antibiotics. Its ability to invade and damage host tissues is due to the use of quorum sensing (QS) to collectively produce a plethora of virulence factors. Inhibition of QS is an attractive strategy for new antimicrobial agents because it disrupts the initial events of infection without killing the pathogen. Highly diverse microorganisms as endophytes represent an under-explored source of bioactive natural products, offering opportunities for the discovery of novel QS inhibitors (QSI). In the present work, the objective was to explore selective QSIs within a unique collection of fungal endophytes isolated from the tropical palm Astrocaryum sciophilum. The fungi were cultured, extracted, and screened for their antibacterial and specific anti-QS activities against P. aeruginosa. The endophytic strain Lasiodiplodia venezuelensis was prioritized for scaled-up fractionation for its selective activity, leading to the isolation of eight compounds in a single step. Among them, two pyran-derivatives were found to be responsible for the QSI activity, with an effect on some QS-regulated virulence factors. Additional non-targeted metabolomic studies on P. aeruginosa documented their effects on the production of various virulence-related metabolites.","Pellissier, L; Leoni, S; Marcourt, L; Queiroz, EF; Lecoultre, N; Quiros-Guerrero, LM; Barthélémy, M; Eparvier, V; Chave, J; Stien, D; Gindro, K; Perron, K; Wolfender, JL",MICROORGANISMS,2021,10.3390/microorganisms9091807,0.973429750942875,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997788957167463,0.00221104283253711,0.999999953401619,4.65983811537285e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12740,Application of Desert DSEs to Nonhost Plants: Potential to Promote Growth and Alleviate Drought Stress of Wheat Seedlings,"To evaluate the applicability of desert dark septate endophytes (DSEs) in crop cultivation, Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissl. (Aa), Paraphoma pye Moslemi & P.W.J. Taylor (Pp), and Paraphoma radicina (McAlpine) Morgan-Jones & J.F. White (Pr) were inoculated into nonhost wheat growing under three water conditions. The plants' biomass, vegetative growth, and physiological parameters were investigated. At harvest, all DSE strains were effective colonizers under all treatments. These DSEs generally positively affected wheat growth but varied among different DSE species, and this promoting effect was more obvious under drought conditions. Under mild drought (MD) treatments, Aa and Pr increased the leaf number and plant height of hosts. Pr showed a significant beneficial influence on the wheat's total biomass under all treatments, while Aa and Pp showed benefits only under the well-watered or MD treatment. The response mechanisms of DSE-inoculated wheat under stress may be due to the enhanced photosynthetic efficiency and antioxidant system. Generally, Pr had a stronger beneficial effect. The improved growth and fitness of the inoculated hosts under drought stress may reduce their water supply requirements during seedling growth. We speculate that inoculating wheat with this strain could be a promising approach for water-saving cultivation in arid environments.","Li, X; Liu, YX; Ye, QN; Xu, MH; He, XL",AGRICULTURE-BASEL,2022,10.3390/agriculture12101539,0.977425213716954,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999963519684688,3.6480315311994e-5,0.999999999719545,2.80454881540493e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18819,Rhizobacteria protective hydrogel to promote plant growth and adaption to acidic soil.,"Endophytic plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) could replace chemical fertilizers in sustainable agriculture. Unfortunately, they are susceptible to harsh environmental conditions. Here, we proposed a polymeric hydrogel (PMH) consisting of carboxymethyl chitosan, sodium alginate, and calcium chloride for loading and protecting endophytic PGPR. This hydrogel can load endophytic PGPRs to not only boost its growth-promoting efficiency, but also help them adapt more effectively to environments. Using endophytic PGPR Ensifer C5 as model bacteria and Brasscia napus as host, we demonstrate that the PMH facilitate the colonization of endophytic PGPRs in the apical and lateral root primordia regions. Further analysis indicates that the PMH modulate suberin deposition of the endodermal cell layers and regulate the accumulation of auxin at the root tip. Meanwhile, PMH enhances the antioxidant capacity and disease resistance properties of plants by increasing the content of arachidonic acid metabolism intermediates in the plant. Importantly, the combination of PMH and endophytic PGPRs increases the yields of B. napus by approximately 30% in the field. Furthermore, PMH attenuates the loss of endophytic PGPR activity in the acidic environments. Overall, this microbial encapsulation strategy is a promising way to protect fragile endophytic microorganisms, providing attractive avenues in sustainable agriculture.",Feng Q; Luo Y; Liang M; Cao Y; Wang L; Liu C; Zhang X; Ren L; Wang Y; Wang D; Zhu Y; Zhang Y; Xiao B; Li N,Nature communications,2025,10.1038/s41467-025-56988-3,0.977814295213855,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.94992150647504,0.0500784935249603,0.999999999791021,2.08979278326638e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2090,"Endophytic Effect of the South African Beauveria bassiana Strain PPRI 7598 on the Population Growth and Development of the Russian Wheat Aphid, Diuraphis noxia","The Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov), is one of the main pests of small-grain cereal crops, including bread wheat, Triticum aestivum (Poaceae). In a series of glasshouse experiments, we evaluated the systemic effect of endophytic Beauveria bassiana strain PPRI 7598 on D. noxia biotype RWASA1 using three South African wheat cultivars, Gariep, Molopo, and Kariega. The objectives of the study were: (a) to determine the effect of endophytism on RWA reproduction and population growth, and (b) to assess the effect of the endophyte on aphid biomass and T. aestivum response to D. noxia herbivory using a damage rating index. Plant endophytic colonisation was confirmed before each trial using a B. bassiana-selective medium. Three independent trials were performed 10 days apart under glasshouse conditions. The effect of the endophyte-treated versus non-treated plants varied significantly in terms of net reproductive rate (R0) and the intrinsic rate of increase (rm) of the D. noxia population. Overall, the endophyte significantly reduced D. noxia R0 by approximately 14 nymphs/female and decreased the aphid mass by 13% in treated plants, whereas the mean aphid mass increased by 17% in control plants in all pooled cultivars. These findings demonstrated the endophytic potential of B. bassiana strain PPRI 7598 for suppression of D. noxia populations in RWASA1-susceptible cultivars. The integration of B. bassiana endophytism with host plant resistance may counteract biotype development and support a more sustainable approach towards RWA control in integrated pest management programmes.","Motholo, LF; Booyse, M; Hatting, JL; Tsilo, TJ; Lekhooa, M; Thekisoe, O",AGRICULTURE-BASEL,2023,10.3390/agriculture13051060,0.908397927301063,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999489824838435,5.1017516156495e-4,0.999999993958475,6.04152539107616e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

5305,IMPACT OF SIMULATED EROSION ON THE ABUNDANCE AND ACTIVITY OF INDIGENOUS VESICULAR-ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL ENDOPHYTES IN AN OXISOL,The influence of simulated erosion on the abundance and activity of indigenous vasicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) populations was evaluated in an Oxisol. Surface-soil losses in excess of 7.5 cm were generally associated with significant decreases in the numbers of total and active VAM propagules and in the symbiotic effectiveness of the active propagules. Surface-soil removal not exceeding 7.5 cm was associated with decreased propagule abundance without adverse effects of VAM colonization of roots and symbiotic effectiveness of the fungi. The extent of VAM colonization of roots and the degree of symbiotic effectiveness observed at this level of simulated erosin were significantly higher than those observed in the soil not subjected to simulated erosion. This stimulation is attributed to the removal of antagonistic biotic factors as the top 7.5 cm of soil was removed. It is concluded that propagules lost during erosional soil losses must be replaced before legumes grown on relatively highly weathered and severely eroded tropical soils could appriciably benefit from the VAM symbiosis.,"HABTE, M",BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS,1989,10.1007/BF00292576,0.891964991398363,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.799524020597163,0.200475979402837,0.998073588580473,0.00192641141952721,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
8763,Effects of fungicide treatment on metabolite profiles of Aquilaria malaccensis,"Aquilaria malaccensis is an agarwood-producing tree. Previous studies have shown that endo-phytic fungi may colonize A. malaccensis. Endophytes are known to be capable of altering plants' secondary metabolites, although the mechanism adopted by the plants remains unclear. This paper aimed to observe the differences in the metabolite profiles of A. malaccensis by eliminating the presence of endophytic fungi with fungicide. Three solvents i.e., ethanol, ethyl acetate, and chloroform, were used for extracting the 2-year-old A. malaccensis. The extracts were examined by scanning with UV-Vis Spectrophotometry and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) for the metabolites profile. The absorbances data were analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), followed by Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). The results showed that groupings between control and fungicide-treated extract formed in the PLS-DA score plot. The important wavelength values for the separation were identified. Identification of compounds found inside the A. malaccensis plants based on the GC -MS results was conducted. Several compounds were specifically found in the control-treated extract of A. malaccensis plants. Respectively, the total phenolics and total flavonoids inside the A. malaccensis extract were calculated using Folin-Ciocalteu's and aluminum chloride tests.

9621,The decreasing trend of the competitive advantage of endophyte-infected Achnatherum sibiricum over endophyte-free plants under high nitrogen conditions was reversed by pathogenic fungi inoculation,"Background and aims According to the nitrogen disease hypothesis, plant diseases will become more serious with the aggravation of global nitrogen (N) deposition. Numerous studies have indicated that Epichlo & euml; endophytes can enhance host plant resistance to pathogens. It is unclear how the competitive ability of endophyte-infected (EI) over endophytefree (EF) plants changes under the interference of N deposition and plant disease.Methods In this study, Achnatherum sibiricum, native to the Inner Mongolia steppe of China, was used as experimental material. We experimentally manipulated N addition and pathogen inoculation and examined the growth and competition between EI and EF A. sibiricum.Results The results showed that EI plants had a greater competitive advantage than EF plants under low N conditions, and this advantage decreased with the N supply. When high N and pathogens were both present, pathogen inoculation reversed the adverse effects of high N supply on the competitive advantage of EI A. sibiricum. Epichlo & euml; endophytes not only reduced the disease of EI plants but also reduced the disease of neighboring EF plants. Meanwhile, Epichlo & euml; endophytes changed the response of the host disease to N. The disease index of EF plants increased with increasing leaf N content, while that of EI plants did not change.Conclusion This study highlights that under the dual factors of N deposition and pathogen infection, endophytic fungi improve the competitive ability of host plants. Our results show that considering both biotic and abiotic factors is crucial for predicting the dominance of plant-fungal symbionts in the community.","Zhang, JZ; Yu, XH; Qu, YB; Shi, XJ; He, LY; Wei, XQ; Chen, L; Zhao, NX; Ren, AZ",PLANT AND SOIL,2023,10.1007/s11104-023-06239-5,0.755466592103392,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.983703984337127,0.0162960156628734,0.999999999713221,2.86778933933363e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

18858,A conserved fungal Knr4/Smi1 protein is crucial for maintaining cell wall stress tolerance and host plant pathogenesis.,"Filamentous plant pathogenic fungi pose significant threats to global food security, particularly through diseases like Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) and Septoria Tritici Blotch (STB) which affects cereals. With mounting challenges in fungal control and increasing restrictions on fungicide use due to environmental concerns, there is an urgent need for innovative control strategies. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the stage-specific infection process of Fusarium graminearum in wheat spikes by generating a dual weighted gene co-expression network (WGCN). Notably, the network contained a mycotoxin-enriched fungal module (F12) that exhibited a significant correlation with a detoxification gene-enriched wheat module (W12). This correlation in gene expression was validated through quantitative PCR. By examining a fungal module with genes highly expressed during early symptomless infection that was correlated to a wheat module enriched in oxidative stress genes, we identified a gene encoding FgKnr4, a protein containing a Knr4/Smi1 disordered domain. Through comprehensive analysis, we confirmed the pivotal role of FgKnr4 in various biological processes, including oxidative stress tolerance, cell cycle stress tolerance, morphogenesis, growth, and pathogenicity. Further studies confirmed the observed phenotypes are partially due to the involvement of FgKnr4 in regulating the fungal cell wall integrity pathway by modulating the phosphorylation of the MAP-kinase MGV1. Orthologues of the FgKnr4 gene are widespread across the fungal kingdom but are absent in other Eukaryotes, suggesting the protein has potential as a promising intervention target. Encouragingly, the restricted growth and highly reduced virulence phenotypes observed for ΔFgknr4 were replicated upon deletion of the orthologous gene in the wheat fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of an integrated network-level analytical approach to pinpoint genes of high interest to pathogenesis and disease control.",Kroll E; Bayon C; Rudd J; Armer VJ; Magaji-Umashankar A; Ames R; Urban M; Brown NA; Hammond-Kosack K,PLoS pathogens,2025,10.1371/journal.ppat.1012769,0.879887671365235,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.966309211009256,0.0336907889907439,0.999999542909137,4.5709086304857e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

19704,Diversity and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in rhizosphere soil and endophytes of leafy vegetables: Focusing on the effect of the vegetable species.,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the endophytes of vegetables represent a potential route of human exposure to the soil resistome. However, the effect of vegetable species on the endophytic ARG profiles is unclear, hampering our understanding of how ARGs migrate into the soil-vegetable system and their potential health risks. Here, we planted four leafy vegetables (cilantro, endive, lettuce, and pak choi), which are commonly eaten raw, and analyzed the resistomes and microbiomes in three sample types (rhizosphere soil, root, and leaf endophytes). A total of 150 ARG subtypes were detected using high-throughput quantitative PCR. Vegetable species had a significant effect on ARG diversity and abundance, and pak choi accumulated more ARGs in its associated microbiome than the other three vegetables. The bacterial community was the primary factor shaping ARG profiles and was significantly correlated with ARG subtypes. We identified aadE, tet(34), and vanSB as shared ARGs among leaves of the four vegetables; the bacterial families correlated with tet(34) and vanSB were also shared across the vegetables and belonged to Proteobacteria.

Various methods have been developed to control this phytopathogen, such as the cultural, biological, and chemical controls, the latter being the most widely used in the agricultural sector. The treatment of this fungus through systemic fungicides, although practical, brings problems because the agrochemical agents used have shown mutagenic effects on the fungus, increasing the pathogen's resistance. The design and the synthesis of novel synthetic antifungal agents used against FOX have been broadly studied in recent years. This review article presents a compendium of the synthetic methodologies during the last ten years as promissory, which can be used to afford novel and potential agrochemical agents. The revision is addressed from the structural core of the most active synthetic compounds against FOX.

17104,Isolation and characterization of endophytic plant growth-promoting bacteria from date palm tree (Phoenix dactylifera L.) and their potential role in salinity tolerance.,"Endophytic bacteria were isolated from date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) seedling roots, characterized and tested for their ability to help plants grow under saline conditions. Molecular characterization showed that the majority of these strains belonged to the genera Bacillus and Enterobacter and had different degrees of resistance to various antibiotics. Some of these strains were able to produce the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase and the plant growth regulatory hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Some strains were also able to chelate ferric iron (Fe(3+)) and solubilize potassium (K(+)), phosphorus (PO 4 (3-) ) and zinc (Zn(2+)), and produce ammonia. The results also showed that ACC deaminase activity and IAA production was slightly increased in some strains in response to an increase in NaCl concentration in the growth media. Consistent with these results, selected strains such as PD-R6 (Paenibacillus xylanexedens) and PD-P6 (Enterobacter cloacae) were able to enhance canola root elongation when grown under normal and saline conditions as demonstrated by a gnotobiotic root elongation assay.

19324,"Developed network between taxoid and phenylpropanoid pathways in Cryptosporiopsis tarraconensis, taxan-producing endophytic fungus by Debiased Sparse Partial Correlation (DSPC) algorithm.","Although bioproduction of Paclitaxel by endophytic fungi is highly considered as an alternative promising source, but its yield is usually very low in comparison with other taxoids. Different strategies i.e., chemical and physical elicitations have been developed in order to overcome the shortage of Paclitaxel production. Paclitaxel biosynthesis is started with terpenoid pathway followed by phenylpropanoid metabolism where a benzoylphenylisoserine moiety is attached to C13 of baccatin III skeleton. This point which is catalyzed by the function of PAM seems to be a bottleneck that limits the rate of Paclitaxel production. Whether phenylpropanoids pathway regulates the taxanes biosynthesis in Cryptosporiopsis tarraconensis endophytic fungus elicited with benzoic acid (BA) was hypothesized in the present paper. The involvement of certain signal molecules and key enzymes of terpenoid and phenylpropanoid metabolism were investigated. According to the results, application of BA promoted a signaling pathway which was started with increase of H2O2 and ABA and continued by increase of NO and MJ, and finally resulted in increase of both phenylpropanoids and taxanes. However, again the rate of Paclitaxel production was lower than other taxoids, and the latter was much lower than phenolics. Therefore, supplying benzoic acid provided the precursor for the common taxan ring production. It is unlikely that Paclitaxel production is merely controlled by side chain production stage. It is more likely that in C. tarraconensis endophytic fungus, similar to Taxus sp., the competition between phenylpropanoid and taxoid pathways for substrate ended in favor of the former. The interaction network which was constructed based on DSPC algorithm confirmed that most compounds with close proximity have shared metabolic pathway relationships. Therefore, it is unlikely that the feeding with a given precursor directly result in increase of a desired metabolite which is composed of different merits.",Mohammadi Ballakuti N; Ghanati F,PloS one,2023,10.1371/journal.pone.0282010,0.913629578498079,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.728938928780213,0.271061071219787,0.999949183891595,5.08161084045167e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

12503,Association of Caliciopsis pinea Peck and Matsucoccus macrocicatrices Richards with eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) seedling dieback,"Matsucoccus macrocicatrices Richards (Hemiptera: Matsucoccidae) is the only species within this genus that feeds and reproduces on eastern white pine (Pines strobes L.), and at the time of its description, was not observed or known to cause serious damage. With eastern white pine dieback occurring extensively throughout the Appalachian Mountains, researchers are now in search of the contributors to this dieback phenomenon. Since its recent discovery (2007) far outside its historical range, M. macrocicatrices, and cankers associated with Caliciopsis pinea Peck, are regularly present on symptomatic trees throughout the range of eastern white pine. Little is known about the relationship between M. macrocicatrices and the fungal cankers commonly found on eastern white pines expressing dieback symptoms. For this study, we evaluated the relationships between both focal organisms and the extent of dieback symptoms on tree seedlings to identify contributing factors affecting symptomatic trees. We assessed the insect-pathogen complex on 270 eastern white pine seedlings from nine states that include the Appalachian Mountain range. There were positive correlations between M..macrocicatrices and seedling dieback, cankers and seedling dieback, and M. macrocicatrices and cankers in both the southern and northern portions of the Appalachians. About 95% of the observed M. macrocicatrices cysts and shells were associated with cankers, especially C. pineadominated cankers, which were exceptionally abundant on severely affected seedlings. The most prevalent fungi isolated from cankers without apparent fruiting bodies of C. pinea were in the genus Phaeomoniella. Trials were conducted to test the pathogenicity of C. pinea and other fungal isolates. Of the 15 fungal species tested, C. pinea was the only pathogenic species that formed girdling cankers on eastern white pine seedlings. We postulate that there is a facultative relationship between M. macrocicatrices and C. pinea, forming an insect-pathogen complex that is contributing to eastern white pine dieback and significantly impacting its regeneration dynamics in North America.","Schulz, AN; Mech, AM; Cram, MM; Asaro, C; Coyle, DR; Lucardi, RD; Lucas, S; Gandhi, KJK",FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,2018,10.1016/j.foreco.2018.03.013,0.959322340840098,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999473939857877,5.2606014212296e-4,0.999999999969541,3.0458857658288694e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

This study has been conducted hypothesizing that the microbial communities in the TGR area would contribute to the host plant tolerating a range of abiotic stress such as summer flooding, infertility, drought, salinity and soil erosion etc., and they may produce new metabolites, which may possess plentiful bioactive property, especially antioxidant activity. Therefore in the current study, the antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticancer activities of 154 endophytes recovered from D. chinense have been investigated. Furthermore, the active metabolites of the most broad-spectrum bioactive strain have also been studied. Results: A total of 154 fungal endophytes were isolated from roots and stems. They were categorized into 30 morphotypes based on cultural characteristics and were affiliated with 27 different taxa. Among these, the most abundant fungal orders included Diaporthales (34.4%) and Botryosphaeriales (30.5%), which were predominantly represented by the species Phomopsis sp. (24.7%) and Neofusicoccum parvum (23.4%). Fermentation extracts were evaluated, screening for antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Among the 154 isolates tested, 99 (64.3%) displayed significant antioxidant activity, 153 (99.4%) exhibited inclusive antimicrobial activity against at least one tested microorganism and 27 (17.5%) showed exclusive anticancer activity against one or more cancer cell lines. Specifically, the crude extract of Irpex lacteus DR10-1 exhibited note-worthy bioactivities. Further chemical investigation on DR10-1 strain resulted in the isolation and identification of two known bioactive metabolites, indole-3-carboxylic acid (1) and indole-3-carboxaldehyde (2), indicating their potential roles in plant growth promotion and human medicinal value. Conclusion: These results indicated that diverse endophytic fungal population inhabits D. chinense. One of the fungal isolate DR10-1 (Irpex lacteus) exhibited significant antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticancer potential. Further, its active secondary metabolites 1 and 2 also showed antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticancer potential.","Duan, XX; Xu, FF; Qin, D; Gao, TC; Shen, WY; Zuo, SH; Yu, BH; Xu, JR; Peng, YJ; Dong, JY",BMC MICROBIOLOGY,2019,10.1186/s12866-019-1634-0,0.980354081323148,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998963161035796,0.00103683896420372,0.999974929886802,2.50701131976339e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

5947,Identification of antibacterial peptides from endophytic microbiome,"Endophytes, microorganisms living inside plant tissues, are promising producers of lead compounds for the pharmaceutical industry. However, the majority of endophytes are unculturable and therefore inaccessible for functional studies. To evaluate genetic resources of endophytes, we analyzed the biodiversity of fungal microbiome of black crowberry (Empetrum nigrum L.) by next-generation sequencing and found that it consists mainly of unknown taxa. We then separated the host and the endophyte genomes and constructed a fosmid expression library from the endophytic DNA. This library was screened for antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus. A unique antibacterial clone was selected for further analysis, and a gene En-AP1 was identified with no similarity to known sequences. The expressed, folded protein En-AP1 was not active against S. aureus, while tryptic digests exhibited antimicrobial activity. Seven out of twelve synthesized peptides, predicted antibacterial in silico, exhibited in vitro activity towards both S. aureus and Escherichia coli. We propose that the En-AP1 protein is degraded in the library host E. coli and antimicrobial fragments are released from the cell, explaining the in vitro antibacterial activity of the clone. This is the first report of a novel gene expressed in vitro derived from an endophytic microbiome, demonstrating the potential of finding novel genes and compounds from unculturable endophytes.","Tejesvi, MV; Picart, P; Kajula, M; Hautajärvi, H; Ruddock, L; Kristensen, HH; Tossi, A; Sahl, HG; Ek, S; Mattila, S; Pirttilä, AM",APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,2016,10.1007/s00253-016-7765-4,0.860601284733809,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.987514371753747,0.0124856282462534,0.999999936985563,6.30144370017405e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
13620,"Ecology, metabolite production, and substrate utilization in endophytic fungi","Endophytic fungi are a taxonomically and ecologically heterogenous group of organisms, mainly belonging to the Ascomycotina and Deuteromycotina. The isolation methods affect the species composition of the endophyte assemblage in a given host. The number of endophyte taxa isolated from a host species is usually large; however, only few, normally host specific species or strains are dominant. Endophyte assemblages are specific at the host species level, but species composition and frequencies are significantly affected by site‐specific conditions. Moreover, the relative importance and number of endophytic species vary among individuals within sites. In some cases, each individual could be considered a separate ecosystem. In general, however, 40 individuals with 30 to 40 sampling units per organ and individual should be enough to detect 80% of taxa present in a given host at one site. Endophytes usually produce the enzymes necessary for the colonization of plant tissues. Substrate utilization studies and isozyme analysis have demonstrated that most endophytes are able to utilize most plant cell components. The production of growth promoting factors and of metabolites useful in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industry is widespread among endophytic fungi. The usefulness of endophytes in agricultural and pharmaceutical research is briefly discussed. © 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

3040,"Arthrinium phaeospermum isolated from Tuber borchii ascomata: the first evidence for a ""Mycorrhization Helper Fungus""?","A filamentous fungus was isolated from Tuber borchii Vitt. fruiting bodies, and it was identified as an Arthrinium phaeospermum (Corda) M. B. Ellis strain, an ""endophyte"" that forms various associations with healthy leaves, stems, and roots of plants. Molecular analysis confirmed the association of this filamentous fungus with the ascocarps of all collection sites in Salento, Apulia (South Italy). An in vitro symbiosis system between Cistus creticus L. and T. borchii was set up; A. phaeospermum appears to be able to promote mycorrhiza formation in Cistus seedlings, inducing primary root shortening and an increase of secondary roots, similar to the effect of Mycorrhization Helper Bacteria (MHB). Compartmented and uncompartmented bioassays were carried out to investigate the effects of exudates/volatiles released by the truffle-hosted fungus on root architecture; the results showed root shortening in compartmented bioassay suggesting that volatiles released by the fungus alone are sufficient to alter root morphology in early phase of interaction before the mycorrhiza formation.

707,Identification and antibacterial characteristics of an endophytic fungus Fusarium oxysporum from Lilium lancifolium,"Aims: The aim of this study is to isolate and identify an endophytic fungus with antibacterial activity from the Asian medicinal and culinary plant Lilium lancifolium and to study the characteristics of its major antibacterial fractions. Methods and Results: After strict sample sterilization, an endophytic fungus BH-3 with great antibacterial activity against Leuconostoc mesenteroides was isolated from the bulbs of L. lancifolium and was identified as Fusarium oxysporum on the basis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA sequence and morphological traits. After partial purification including superfiltration and gel filtration, the major antibacterial fractions were found to be the substances with the molecular mass ranging from 35 to 60 kDa, mainly 55 kDa. The partially purified antibacterial fractions were stable at thermal processes, with more than 80% of activity left at 60 degrees C for 1 h, and even 70.75% left at 121 degrees C for 15 min. 90.33-98.97% of activity was observed in the pH range of 4.0-7.0. But the fractions were sensitive to different proteases. Conclusions: Endophytic strain F. oxysporum BH-3 isolated from the bulbs of L. lancifolium produced protein-like antibacterial metabolites. The antibacterial assay against Leuc. mesenteroides indicated that the fractions were stable at thermal processes and wide pH conditions, but sensitive to proteolyses. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study provides an increasing understanding of endophytic F. oxysporum in L. lancifolium and its metabolites, which have a great potential in food industry as antibacterial agents.","Liu, XL; Huang, KH; Zhou, JZ; Meng, L; Wang, Y; Zhang, LX",LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY,2012,10.1111/j.1472-765X.2012.03306.x,0.996653275508378,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.984121668888325,0.0158783311116752,0.999999897566449,1.02433550974723e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

With a deep peat soil in pots, shoot production, nodulation and N fixation by clover were increased by 160, 130 and 85% respectively following inoculation with mycorrhiza, but in the field, despite a doubling of root infection, there was no response in growth. On a brown earth soil in the field inoculation with one endophyte (Glomus mosseae L1) out of four tested depressed production of white clover shoots by 42% but enhanced that of leeks (Allium porrum) by 50%; the others were without effect. With dry peaty podzol and brown earth soils in pots, clover shoot production was highest with added P when a water holding capacity of 80% was maintained, but roots from the latter had only 2.6 compared to 68 nodules per plant from the former.

18985,"Investigating the Endophyte Actinomycetota sp. JW0824 Strain as a Potential Bioinoculant to Enhance the Yield, Nutritive Value, and Chemical Composition of Different Cultivars of Anise (Pimpinella anisum L.) Seeds.","Anise (Pimpinella anisum L.) seeds have various nutritional and therapeutic benefits and are thus considered a valuable addition to animal and human health. Hence, in this study, we aimed to induce the nutritive and biological value of anise seeds. To this end, the potential biofortification effect of the endophytic Actinomycetota sp. JW0824 strain, isolated during the fall of 2023 from the medicinal plant Achyranthes aspera, exhibiting natural distribution in the Jazan region of Saudi Arabia, was investigated in four varieties of anise seeds from Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, and Morocco. Results revealed significant increments (p < 0.05) in the seed dry weight percentage (DW%) and oil yields. In line with increased biomass accumulation, the metabolism of the primary and secondary metabolites was increased. There were differential increases in proteins, sugars, flavonoids, alkaloids, phenols, vitamins (e.g., β-carotene, ascorbic acid), and essential oil components (e.g., phenylpropanoids and monoterpenes), along with their precursor phenylalanine. Consistently, the activity of L-phenylalanine aminolyase (PAL) was increased in the Egyptian and Tunisian varieties at 83.88% and 77.19%, respectively, while 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase (DAHPS) activity increased in all varieties, with a significant 179.31% rise in the Egyptian variety.

4428,Characterization of Endophytic Microorganisms of Rice (Oryza sativa L.) Potentials for Blast Disease Biocontrol and Plant Growth Promoting Agents,"One hundred twenty-five endophytic microorganisms were isolated from the roots, stems, and leaves of four prominent rice cultivars growing in temperate regions. Their potential to combat rice blast disease and promote plant growth was investigated. The dual culture tests highlighted the strong antagonistic activity of five fungal (ranging from 89%-70%) and five bacterial (72%-61%) endophytes. Subsequent examination focused on volatile compounds produced by selected isolates to counter the blast pathogen. Among these, the highest chitinase (13.76 mu g mL-1) and siderophore (56.64%), was exhibited by Aspergillus flavus, and the highest HCN production was shown by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (36.15 mu M mL-1). In terms of growth promotion traits, Aspergillus flavus and Enterobacter cloacae excelled in activities viz, phosphorous solubilization, ammonia production, auxin and gibberellic acid production, and nitrogen fixation. The Identity of these endophytes was confirmed through molecular analysis as Trichoderma afroharzianum, Trichoderma harzianum, Penicillium rubens, Aspergillus fla-vus, Stenotrophomonas rhizophila, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Bacillus licheniformis. Under greenhouse conditions, the highest disease control was shown by isolate Bacillus licheniformis and A. flavus with an inhibition of 79%, followed by S. rhizophila (77%) and T. afroharzianum (73%). The overall results of this study showed that Bacillus licheniformis and Stenotrophomonas rhizophila have great potential to be used as bio-stimulant and biocontrol agents to manage rice blast disease.","Parveen, S; Mohiddin, FA; Bhat, MA; Baba, ZA; Jeelani, F; Bhat, MA; Nabi, SU; Hamid, B; Bandey, S; Rasool, F; Amin, Z; Al-Ashkar, I; Adnan, M; El Sabagh, A",PHYTON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,2023,10.32604/phyton.2023.030921,0.751096875777828,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999502818180929,4.9718181907107e-4,0.999999999999587,4.1289194285809597e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

9747,Effects of Fertilization and Fungal and Insect Attack on Systemic Protein Defenses of Austrian Pine,"Despite their economic and ecological importance, defense responses of conifers to pests are little understood. In a 3-year experiment, we monitored systemic fungal (Diplodia pinea)- and insect (Neodiprion sertifer)-induced defense protein activities and total soluble proteins in needles and phloem of Austrian pine (Pinus nigra) across a soil fertility gradient. In both years, total soluble protein content of foliage and phloem declined with increasing fertility across induction treatments, while defensive protein activities generally increased with increasing fertility. In 2005, total soluble protein content in branch phloem was increased by fungal inoculation of the stem. Peroxidase activity was suppressed in needles by insect defoliation in 2006, while polyphenol oxidase activity was systemically induced in branch phloem by insect attack in 2005. Trypsin inhibitor activities in phloem did not respond to any induction or fertility treatment. Nutritive quality of Austrian pine tissue declined with increasing fertility, while several protein-based defenses simultaneously increased.","Barto, K; Enright, S; Eyles, A; Wallis, C; Chorbadjian, R; Hansen, R; Herms, DA; Bonello, P; Cipollini, D",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,2008,10.1007/s10886-008-9550-z,0.881544931344308,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99621919088141,0.00378080911859029,0.999999998542454,1.45754597280501e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Previously we have reported that Eutypella spp - CrP14 isolated from stem cutting of this plant had shown significant antiproliferative activity when tested in vitro against HeLa cell line. The present study was conducted to identify the anticancer compound responsible for the anti-proliferative activity of the fungal extract and to evaluate its in vitro anticancer and apoptotic effects. Methods: The anti-proliferative activity of the fungal anticancer compound, vincristine was analyzed by MTT assay against different cancer cell lines. We examined its efficacy of apoptotic induction on A431 cells. The parameters examined included cell cycle distribution, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), DNA fragmentation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Results: The presence of vincristine in fungal culture filtrate was confirmed through chromatographic and spectroscopic analyses, and the amount was estimated to be 53 +/- 5.0 mu g/l. The partially purified fungal vincristine had strong cytotoxic activity towards human squamous carcinoma cells - A431 in the MTT assay. Furthermore, we showed that the fungal vincristine was capable of inducing apoptosis in A431 cells through generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of the intrinsic pathway leading to loss of MMP. Conclusions: We have demonstrated for the first time that the vincristine from Eutypella spp - CrP14 is an efficient inducer of apoptosis in A431 cells, meriting its further evaluation in vivo.","Kuriakose, GC; Palem, PPC; Jayabaskaran, C",BMC COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE,2016,10.1186/s12906-016-1299-2,0.649313919877821,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.979855361297373,0.0201446387026274,0.999999287950602,7.12049397888492e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
19026,Endophyte mediated biocontrol mechanisms of phytopathogens in agriculture.,"The global human population is growing and demand for food is increasing. Global agriculture faces numerous challenges, including excessive application of synthetic pesticides, emergence of herbicide-and pesticide-resistant pathogenic microbes, and more frequent natural disasters associated with global warming. Searches for valuable endophytes have increased, with the aim of making agriculture more sustainable and environmentally friendly. Endophytic microbes are known to have a variety of beneficial effects on plants. They can effectively transfer nutrients from the soil into plants, promote plant growth and development, increase disease resistance, increase stress tolerance, prevent herbivore feeding, reduce the virulence of pathogens, and inhibit the growth of rival plant species. Endophytic microbes can considerably minimize the need for agrochemicals, such as fertilizers, fungicides, bactericides, insecticides, and herbicides in the cultivation of crop plants. This review summarizes current knowledge on the roles of endophytes focusing on their mechanisms of disease control against phytopathogens through the secretion of antimicrobial substances and volatile organic compounds, and the induction of systemic resistance in plants.

Plants were grown in a greenhouse in pot cultures using a soil low in plant-available P under 3 P regimes: no additional P, P added as KH2PO4 or P uptake enhanced by colonization of the host plant with the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungus Glomus fasciculatum (Thaxt. sensu Gerd.)

The growth response of VAM plants to increasing light relative to non-VAM plants in the absence of additional P increased while the response relative to non-VAM plants with additional P decreased slightly. The highly significant interaction between the factors (P < 0.001) of the experiment was due to differences in the magnitude and direction of simple effects of the factors.

6386,Endophytic fungi associated with Vitis vinifera with antibiosis capacity against Botrytis cinerea,"Introduction. Endophytic fungi (EF) in grapevines (Vitis vinifera) have great potential for agricultural applications and may represent possible biological control agents for vineyards. Objective. To isolate and identify endophytic fungi (EF) from grapevine plants with antibiosis capacity against Botrytis cinerea. Materials and methods. Young and mature branches from forty healthy grapevine plants were collected from seven production lots in the Ca & ntilde;ete province, Lima, Peru, during March to May 2022. EF isolation was performed on 702 sections of disinfected tissues using potato dextrose agar (PDA) culture medium, and identification was carried out at the genus level. Secondary metabolites were extracted from twenty-eight EF strains to determine the mycelial inhibition of the pathogen. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted on the evaluated parameters using the Minitab statistical program. Results. A total of 129 EF strains were isolated from leaves and stems of young and mature grapevine branches, encompassing seven genera (Trichoderma, Aspergillus, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Nigrospora, and Stemphylium). The highest frequency was found in leaves and mature branches. Trichoderma and Alternaria were the most frecuent genera in grapevine plants, with 22.48 % and 21.71%, respectively. Metabolites obtained from the EFVH-01 strain of the genus Cladosporium, and EF-99 and EF-70 strains of the genus Alternaria, had the greatest effect on mycelial inhibition of the pathogen. Conclusions. Strains of endophytic fungi from the genera Cladosporium and Alternaria showed antibiosis capacity against Botrytis cinerea at the laboratory scale, which could potential biocontrol agents of pathogens in grapevine cultivation.","León-Ttacca, B; Alca-Zavala, J; Rosas-Martínez, J; Robles-Perez, E; Zamudio-Eustaquio, P; García-Diaz, L",AGRONOMIA MESOAMERICANA,2024,10.15517/am.2024.56193,0.910800301121068,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.878617863386515,0.121382136613485,0.999999527675277,4.72324722666784e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification confirmed the presence of nif-H gene in all the isolates. Morphological, biochemical, and molecular characteristics indicated that all of them belonged to the genus Burkholderia One of them, MGK3, was consistently more active in reducing acetylene, and 16S rDNA sequences of isolate MGK3 confirmed its identification as Burkholderia vietnamiensis. Colonization of rice root was confirmed by strain MGK3 marked with gusA gene. The inoculated roots showed a blue color, which was most intense at the points of lateral root emergence and at the root tip. Transverse sections of roots, 15 days after inoculation, revealed beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activity within many of the cortical intercellular spaces next to the stele and within the aerenchyma. Nitrogen fixation was quantified by using (15)N isotope dilution method with two different cultivars grown in pot and field experiments. Higher nitrogen fixation was observed in variety Ponni than in ADT-43, where nearly 42% (field) and 40% (pot) of the nitrogen was derived from the atmosphere (% Ndfa). Isolate MGK3 was used to inoculate rice seedlings in a comparison with four other diazotrophs, viz., Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus LMG7603, Herbaspirillum seropedicae LMG6513, Azospirillum lipoferum 4B LMG4348, and B. vietnamiensis LMG10929. They were used to conduct two pot and four field inoculation experiments. MGK3 alone, and combined with other diazotrophs, performed best under both pot and field conditions: combined inoculation produced yield increases between 9.5 and 23.6%, while MGK3 alone increased yield by 5.6 to 12.16% over the uninoculated control treatment.",Govindarajan M; Balandreau J; Kwon SW; Weon HY; Lakshminarasimhan C,Microbial ecology,2008,10.1007/s00248-007-9247-9,0.942656943327386,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994073289991549,0.00592671000845107,0.999994455098161,5.54490183934941e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
9386,Isolation of anticancer and anti-trypanosome secondary metabolites from the endophytic fungus Aspergillus flocculus via bioactivity guided isolation and MS based metabolomics,"This study aims to identify bioactive anticancer and anti-trypanosome secondary metabolites from the fermentation culture of Aspergillus flocculus endophyte assisted by modem metabolomics technologies. The endophyte was isolated from the stem of the medicinal plant Markhamia platycalyx and identified using phylogenetics. Principle component analysis was employed to screen for the optimum growth endophyte culturing conditions and revealing that the 30-days rice culture (RC-30d) provided the highest levels of the bioactive agents. To pinpoint for active chemicals in endophyte crude extracts and successive fractions, a new application of molecular interaction network is implemented to correlate the chemical and biological profiles of the antitrypanosome active fractions to highlight the metabolites mediating for bioactivity prior to purification trials. Multivariate data analysis (MVDA), with the aid of dereplication studies, efficiently annotated the putatively active anticancer molecules. The small-scale RC-30d fungal culture was purified using high-throughput chromatographic techniques to yield compound 1, a novel polyketide molecule though inactive. Whereas, active fractions revealed from the bioactivity guided fractionation of medium scale RC-30d culture were further purified to yield 7 metabolites, 5 of which namely cis-4-hydroxymellein, 5-hydroxymellein, diorcinol, botryoisocoumarin A and mellein, inhibited the growth of chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 at 30 mu M. 3-Hydroxymellein and diorcinol exhibited a respective inhibition of 56% and 97% to the sleeping sickness causing parasite Trypanosoma brucei brucei. More interestingly, the anti-trypanosomal activity of A. flocculus extract appeared to be mediated by the synergistic effect of the active steroidal compounds i.e. ergosterol peroxide, ergosterol and campesterol. The isolated structures were elucidated by using 1D, 2D NMR and HR-ESIMS.","Tawfike, AF; Romli, M; Clements, C; Abbott, G; Young, L; Schumacher, M; Diederich, M; Farag, M; Edrada-Ebel, R",JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY B-ANALYTICAL TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BIOMEDICAL AND LIFE SCIENCES,2019,10.1016/j.jchromb.2018.12.032,0.978642171551456,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.898349980768357,0.101650019231643,0.999863480223968,1.3651977603179e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
17175,First Report of Pineapple Black Rot Caused by Ceratocystis paradoxa on Ananas comosus in French Guiana.,"Ceratocystis paradoxa (Dade) C. Moreau is a polyphagous wound parasite causing black rot post-harvest disease in pineapple. This fungus is responsible for high losses of fruit destined for the fresh market and is a common problem in many countries (2). C. paradoxa is officially listed as a quarantine pathogen for French Guiana. In November 2013, the Plant Protection Service of French Guiana observed damage in crops of Ananas comosus var. perolera located in Corossony (4°19'10.8″ N, 52°10'17.1″ W) and Wayabo (5°01'02.3″ N, 52°36'18.7″ W) (eastern and middle part of the country). The three plants collected at each location showed a soft base rot of the stem and of young leaves, and developed a foul smell. Plant tissues were collected from the edge of the lesions, chopped in small pieces, and plated on malt extract agar supplemented with 100 ppm chloramphenicol. The plates were incubated at 25°C with a 12-h photoperiod. After 5 days, a fungal colony, first white and downy, then becoming black and velvety after 10 days, was transferred on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated in the same conditions. After 7 days, the colonies produced phialides releasing cylindrical or doliform conidia that were unicellular, colorless to pale brown, in long chains (3.09 to 20.17 × 3.1 to 5.57 μm, n = 20) and oval, pyriform, brown chlamydospores (8.02 to 21.32 × 4.20 to 9.76 μm, n = 20), occurring in long chains or singly with a vertical slit, usually not very visible. Furthermore, the colonies emitted a fruity odor. On the basis of these morphological characteristics, the fungus was identified as the anamorph of C. paradoxa (Thielaviopsis paradoxa (De Seynes) Höhn.) (1). The species designation was confirmed by sequencing the ITS region of the rDNA followed by comparison with reference sequences available in GenBank. Fungal material was collected from PDA culture by scraping the mycelium with a sterile needle and transferring into 2-ml microtubes. Fungal total DNA was then extracted and the ITS region was amplified by PCR using the ITS1-ITS4 primer pair. Nucleotide sequence was determined and deposited in GenBank (KJ667047). BLAST analysis showed 100% identity with C. paradoxa. The pathogenicity of the fungus was confirmed by inoculating two pineapples with mycelium from the C. paradoxa isolate grown on PDA. The peel of fruits and the base of the crowns were wounded with a sterile scalpel blade, each at five locations. Mycelial plugs (avg. 4 mm diameter) were placed on the wounds. Inoculation sites were wrapped with Parafilm to prevent dehydration and to hold the mycelial plugs in position. Negative controls received five sterile PDA plugs. The samples were incubated at 25°C in a moist chamber with a 12-h photoperiod. Eight days after inoculation, negative controls remained symptomless, whereas characteristic soft, watery, and black rot lesions developed on the base of all the crowns that were inoculated with C. paradoxa. The pathogen was successfully re-isolated from symptomatic tissues, fulfilling Koch's postulate. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. paradoxa on A. comosus in French Guiana, and quarantine measures have been enforced to prevent the spread of this pathogen that might also cause severe losses on other susceptible plant species that are important for the local market (e.g., banana, coconut, sugar cane). Pineapple has become a major crop in French Guiana, and is now subjected to a more intensive monitoring, which may explains why this disease was discovered recently. References: (1) T. R.

15866,Isolation and identification of endophytic fungi from Cyclocarya paliurus (Batal.) Iljinskaja; [青钱柳产黄酮类物质真菌的分离与鉴定],"[Objective] This study aimed to identify the endophytic fungi produced flavonoids in Cyclocarya paliurus (Batal.) Iljinskaja and explore a new method to extract flavonoids. [Method] The endophytic fungi in the branches, leaves, roots, and bark of C. paliurus (Batal.) Iljinskaja were isolated using the tissue separation method. By observing the morphological characteristics of the endophytes, the fermentation products of the endophytic fungi from C. paliurus (Batal.) Iljinskaja were identified using the chromogenic reaction method, thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The endophytic fungi produced flavonoids were screened, and the total flavonoid production was determined. Moreover, the strains were identified based on the morphological characteristics and the phylogenetic analysis of the intervening sequences of the fungal rDNA. [Result] In total, 67 strains of endophytic fungi were obtained; through the identification of morphological characteristics, they were identified to belong to three classes, four orders, six families and ten genera. Four endophytic fungi producing flavonoids were finally identified: PZ06, CY12, CP06 and PP03. The most abundant flavonoids, with a yield of 3. 61 mg / L, were produced by strain PZ06. Molecular identification combined with morphological identification indicated that PZ06, CP06 and PP03 belong to the genus Alternaria, whereas CY12 belongs to the genus Eupenicillium. The dominant flavonoid-producing endophytic fungi of C. paliurus (Batal.) Iljinskaja belong to the genus Alternaria. [Conclusion] The study of endophytic fungi in C. paliurus (Batal.) Iljinskaja is a key significance for the development and utilization of endophytes. In addition to identifying the endophytic fungi, the present study also provides a novel method for the extraction of active substances from C. paliurus (Batal.)

15497,Effects of Extracts from PaecilomycesVariotii on Chlorophyll Fluorescence Transient in Leaves of Maize under Waterlogging Stress; [宛氏拟青霉提取物对淹水胁迫下玉米叶片叶绿素荧光动力学参数的影响],"【Background and objective】Waterlogging is an abiotic stress occurring frequently during maize growth season, especially in its initial seedling stage. The crude extract of endophytePaecilomycesvariotii is a bio-stimulant widely used in China to promote plant growth and improve its resistance against waterlogging. We extracted Paecilomycesvariotii(PVE) from the endophytic fungus in a wild sea buckthorn, which is not only able to protect crops from pathogens but also promotes crop growth. However, the underlying mechanisms of how PVE enhances the tolerance of maize against waterlogging is obscure. The aim of this paper is to fill this knowledge gap.【Method】We used maize as the model plant and conducted the experiment in laboratory. Maize seedings treated with PVE were subjected to waterlogging, with seedlings not treated with PVE taken as control. For each treatment, we measured the change in chlorophyll fluorescence transient curve (OJIP) of the seedings.【Result】Waterlogging hindered growth of the maize seedling and reduced its net photosynthetic rate (Pn) as a result. Waterlogging lasting more than four days changed the OJIP curve by reducing the active reaction centre per unit area, and altered the ability of electronic transmission from QA to QB (Ψo and δRo). Treating the seedlings with PVE alleviated the waterlogging-induced decrease in specific energy fluxes per unit area for absorption (AB/CSm), trapping (TRo/CSm), and electron transport (ETo/CSm), while in the meantime maintaining a relatively high heat dissipation capacity (DIo/CSm).【Conclusion】Spraying PVE over maize seedings enhanced their tolerance to waterlogging stress and helped their quick recovery after the waterlogging receded. © 2021, Editorial Office of Journal of Irrigation and Drainage.

10865,Neuroprotective γ-Pyrones from Fusarium Solani JS-0169: Cell-Based Identification of Active Compounds and an Informatics Approach to Predict the Mechanism of Action,"Glutamate toxicity has been implicated in neuronal cell death in both acute CNS injury and in chronic diseases. In our search for neuroprotective agents obtained from natural sources that inhibit glutamate toxicity, an endophytic fungus, Fusarium solani JS-0169 isolated from the leaves of Morus alba, was found to show potent inhibitory activity. Chemical investigation of the cultures of the fungus JS-0169 afforded isolation of six compounds, including one new gamma-pyrone (1), a known gamma-pyrone, fusarester D (2), and four known naphthoquinones: karuquinone B (3), javanicin (4), solaniol (5), and fusarubin (6). To identify the protective effects of the isolated compounds (1-6), we assessed their inhibitory effect against glutamate-induced cytotoxicity in HT22 cells. Among the isolates, compound 6 showed significant neuroprotective activity on glutamate-mediated HT22 cell death. In addition, the informatics approach using in silico systems pharmacology identified that compound 6 may exert its neuroprotective effect by controlling the amount of ubiquinone. The results suggest that the metabolites produced by the endophyte Fusarium solani JS-0169 might be related to the neuroprotective activity of its host plant, M. alba.","Choi, HG; Song, JH; Park, M; Kim, S; Kim, CE; Kang, KS; Shim, SH",BIOMOLECULES,2020,10.3390/biom10010091,0.962020029354295,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993673856289522,0.00632614371047834,0.999999977151891,2.28481092934274e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3739,Microbiota of grapevine woody tissues with or without esca-foliar symptoms in northeast Spain,"Grapevine Trunk Diseases (GTDs), particularly esca, are major concerns in Spain. This study characterized the fungal and bacterial communities in a 30-year-old 'Cabernet Sauvignon' vineyard in Catalonia, Spain. Six symptomatic vines expressing esca-foliar symptoms and six additional asymptomatic plants were surveyed. Non-necrotic and necrotic tissues were sampled from rootstocks, trunks and cordons of the selected vines. Fungal isolations and molecular techniques were used in combination to investigate the endophytic microflora and to characterize the fungal and bacterial diversity of the vines. Pathogenic fungi involved in GTDs were identified, and the associations were assessed between all the isolated fungal taxa and the health status of vines, host parts and tissue types. Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Diplodia seriata were found in non-necrotic tissues, whereas Fomitiporia mediterranea was mainly found in soft-rot tissues, and Neofusicoccum parvum and Eutypa cf. lata in hard necrotic tissues. Several Alternaria and Trichoderma species were isolated, mainly from non-necrotic tissues. The single strand conformation polymorphism fingerprinting method showed differences in bacterial and fungal communities between the different types of tissue in healthy and diseased vines. However, no differences were detected in these microbial communities between non-necrotic tissues from asymptomatic and symptomatic vines. Two frequently-isolated species of Paraconiothyrium were tested for pathogenicity, but their pathogenic roles on grapevines was unclear.","Elena, G; Bruez, E; Rey, P; Luque, J",PHYTOPATHOLOGIA MEDITERRANEA,2018,10.14601/Phytopathol_Mediterr-23337,0.730695903084955,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999992987207986,7.01279201364652e-6,0.999999948437994,5.15620063312738e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
13541,Distribution of foliar fungal endophytes of Pinus strobus between and within host trees,"The distribution of foliar fungal endophytes within and between needles and trees of Pinus strobus L. (white pine) is largely unknown. In this study, needles were collected in Muskoka, Ontario, plated, and scored for hyphal out-growth of endophytes to observe distributional patterns. Individual trees displayed different levels of infection but branches within those trees had similar levels. There was a large difference in the infection levels between the two extant needle age-classes, with the youngest needles being virtually endophyte-free. Needles divided into four sections exhibited the most hyphal outgrowth from the distal portion and the least from the medial-proximal portion. Cultural morphotypes were primarily of the Lophodermium and Hormonema morphologies. Lophodermium occurred at all positions along the needle but Hormonema was restricted to the proximal and distal portions. Infrequently occurring fungi of diverse morphotypes were found at all four needle positions. A separate experiment compared levels of endophyte infection between Muskoka trees and trees growing in an urban area (Guelph, Ontario). Needle pieces from Guelph hosts had low rates of infection (0.02%) compared with needle pieces from Muskoka hosts (66.5%).

In recent years, the quality of S. miltiorrhiza has attracted much attention. Biotic and abiotic elicitors are widely used in cultivation to improve the quality of medicinal plants. We isolated an endophytic fungus, Mucor fragilis, from S. miltiorrhiza. We compared the effects of endophytic fungal elicitors with those of yeast extract together with silver ion, widely used together as effective elicitors, on S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots. Seventeen primary metabolites (amino acids and fatty acids) and five secondary metabolites (diterpenoids and phenolic acids) were analyzed after elicitor treatment. The mycelium extract promoted the accumulation of salvianolic acid B, rosmarinic acid, stearic acid, and oleic acid in S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots. Additionally, qPCR revealed that elicitors affect the accumulation of primary and secondary metabolites by regulating the expression of key genes (SmAACT, SmGGPPS, and SmPAL). This is the first detection of both the primary and secondary metabolites of S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots, and the results of this work should help guide the quality control of S. miltiorrhiza.

17345,Toxigenic capacity and trichothecene production by Fusarium graminearum isolates from Argentina and their relationship with aggressiveness and fungal expansion in the wheat spike.,"At least 20 epidemics of Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat have been registered in the last 50 years in Argentina, with variable intensity. Damage induced by the disease is further aggravated by the presence of mycotoxins in affected grains that may cause health problems to humans and animals. The trichothecene chemotype was analyzed for 112 isolates of Fusarium graminearum from Argentina by polymerase chain reaction and two field trials were conducted to study the aggressiveness of a subsample of 14 representative isolates and to analyze deoxynivalenol (DON) production in planta and in vitro. All isolates belonged to the 15-acetyl-DON chemotype. Significant differences were observed in both the symptom severity induced in wheat spikes and the in vivo DON production, and a close correlation was found between these two variables. However, in vitro toxigenic potential was not correlated with the capacity of F. graminearum isolates to produce DON under natural conditions.

2985,Patterns of interaction between Populus Esch5 and Piriformospora indica:: A transition from mutualism to antagonism,"Piriformospora indica (Sebacinaceae, Basidiomycota) is an axenically cultivable, plant growth promoting root endophyte with a wide host range, including Populus. Rooting of Populus Esch5 explants started within 6 days after transfer to WPM medium. If such plantlets with roots were inoculated with P. indica, there was an increase in root biomass, and the number of 2nd order roots was increased significantly. A totally different observation was recorded when the explants were placed into WPM with pre-grown P. indica. The interaction led to complete blocking of root production and severely inhibited plant growth. Additionally, branched aerial roots appeared which did not penetrate the medium. On contact with the fungal colony or the medium, the ends of the aerial roots became inflated. Prolonged incubation stimulated the fungus to colonize aerial parts of the plant (stem and leaves). Mycelium not only spread on the surface of the aerial parts, but also invaded the cortical tissues inter- and intracellularly. Detached Populus leaves remained vital for 4-5 weeks on sterile agar media or on AspMI medium with pre-grown P. indica. When the fungus was pre-grown on culture media such as WPM, containing ammonium as the main source of nitrogen, leaves in contact with the cultures turned brownish within 4-12 h. Thereafter, the leaves bleached, and about one day later had become whitish. Thus, cultural conditions could alter the behaviour of the fungus drastically: the outcome of the interaction between plant and fungus can be directed from mutualistic to antagonistic, characterized by fungal toxin formation and extension of the colonization to Populus shoots.","Kaldorf, M; Koch, B; Rexer, KH; Kost, G; Varma, A",PLANT BIOLOGY,2005,10.1055/s-2005-837470,0.707335896850549,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.960611226147684,0.039388773852316,0.999999999824463,1.75537362423484e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
11817,"Silicon, endophytes and secondary metabolites as grass defenses against mammalian herbivores","Grasses have been considered to primarily employ tolerance in lieu of defense in mitigating damage caused by herbivory. Yet a number of mechanisms have been identified in grasses, which may deter feeding by grazers. These include enhanced silicon uptake, hosting of toxin-producing endophytic fungi and induction of secondary metabolites. While these mechanisms have been individually studied, their synergistic responses to grazing, as well as their effects on grazers, are poorly known. A field experiment was carried out in 5 x 5 m outdoor enclosures to quantify phytochemical changes of either endophyte-infected (E+) or endophyte-free (E-) meadow fescue (Schedonorus pratensis) in response to medium intensity (corresponding with densities of ca. 1200 voles/ha for 5 weeks during 3 months) or heavy intensity (ca. 1200 voles/ha for 8 weeks during 3 months) grazing by a mammalian herbivore, the field vole (Microtus agrestis). A laboratory experiment was then conducted to evaluate the effects of endophyte infection status and grazing history of the grass diet on vole performance. As predicted, grazing increased foliar silicon content, by up to 13%. Grazing also increased foliar levels of phosphorous and several phenolic compounds, most notably those of the flavonols isorhamnetin-diglycoside and rhamnetin derivative. Silicon concentrations were consistently circa 16% higher in E+ grasses than in E-grasses, at all levels of grazing. Similarly, concentrations of chlorogenic acid derivative were found to be consistently higher in E+ than in E grasses. Female voles maintained on heavily grazed grasses suffered higher mortality rates in the laboratory than female voles fed ungrazed grass, regardless of endophyte infection status. Our results conclusively demonstrate that, in addition to tolerance, grasses employ multi-tiered, effective defenses against mammalian grazers.","Huitu, O; Forbes, KM; Helander, M; Julkunen-Tiitto, R; Lambin, X; Saikkonen, K; Stuart, P; Sulkama, S; Hartley, S",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2014,10.3389/fpls.2014.00478,0.898773872505015,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.942846942722947,0.0571530572770535,0.999994011693612,5.98830638842696e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

4090,Identification of dominant taxa of sooty moulds and their impact on the leaf microbiome,"Sooty moulds are a widespread group of saprophytic ascomycetes that obtain nutrients from honeydew excreted by sap-feeding insects and coat plant tissue with mycelia. Research on sooty moulds has focused on fungal morphology and phylogeny-based taxonomy, but little research has been conducted on the community structure. In this study, the PacBio sequencing platform was used to systematically analyse the fungal and bacterial diversity of the sooty mould community on camphor trees at two sampling sites. Six dominant sooty mould genera were identified, of which three genera of Dothideomycetes were enriched only in diseased samples, while three genera of Eurotiomycetes were present in both healthy and diseased samples. Bacterial diversity and co-occurrence network analysis indicated that the sooty moulds had an effect on the leaf surface bacterial communities but not on the endophyte communities. There was a close correlation between the six dominant pathogenic groups and bacteria in the soot layer. Transcriptomic data from Cinnamomum camphora samples showed that the sooty moulds that did not penetrate plant cells not only affected plant photosynthesis but also induced plant defence responses. This study systematically studied the microbial community of sooty moulds, indicating the close relationship between sooty moulds and the bacterial communities.","Lv, ZY; Hu, C; Hu, Y; Wu, DJ; Zhou, HY; Tian, LC",ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,2023,10.1111/1462-2920.16321,0.983644941541143,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.62754052682033,0.37245947317967,0.99981933842504,1.8066157495955e-4,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
3268,Fusarium oxysporum V5w2 is a non-beneficial endophyte that interacts with Radopholus similis in a wilt disease complex of banana,"Fusarium oxysporum V5w2 is a fungal agent, which was originally intended for biological control of the root pathogenic nematode Radopholus similis among other banana pests. Information on some of its actual effects on banana plants and pests has been scarce. A study was conducted to assess the effects of F. oxysporum V5w2 and mulch on R. similis and banana plants in the field. The experiment was a 3-factor (2 x 2 x 2) complete randomized block design with or without F. oxysporum V5w2, R. similis or mulch. Root damage was higher when plants were inoculated with R. similis compared to non inoculated plants, while plant height, leaf size, bunch size and banana yields were lower in R. similis-inoculated plants. Plant growth and bunch size were greater in mulched than in non-mulched plots, with banana yields on mulched plots increasing by 131% to reach 37 tonnes per hectare. F. oxysporum V5w2-inoculated plants were shorter, with fewer leaves that were smaller, and had shorter duration to harvest than non-inoculated ones. When R. similis-inoculated mulched plants received F. oxysporum V5w2 inoculum, plant toppling over occurred less frequently compared to plants that were not inoculated with the fungus, probably because the plants were smaller in size during growth. The benefits of mulching in banana production were evident, while the claimed enhancing effect of inoculating tissue culture plants with F. oxysporum V5w2 as a biological control agent could not be verified. I conclude by suggesting that, the use of F. oxysporum V5w2 as a biological control agent of R. similis and other pests should be reconsidered, because this fungal strain has the potential of invading xylem vessels and becoming pathogenic to banana plants.

4585,Diversity and biotechnological potential of endophytic Bacillus species originating from the stem apoplast fluid of sugarcane plants,"The genus Bacillus has been isolated from a wide range of environments and comprises species with biotechnological applications, such as bioinseticides, biofungicides, and biofertilizers. This study investigated the endophytic occurrence and diversity of Bacilli in the apoplastic fluid of sugarcane cultivated in Brazil. Their biocontrol activity against fungi and their plant growth promotion (PGP) potential in sugarcane mini-set plants were also evaluated. Forty-two Bacillus colonies were isolated from the apoplastic fluid of one-year-old commercial sugarcane varieties and analyzed by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. The ability to produce indols and siderophores and to solubilize phosphate and zinc were evaluated in vitro, along with their cellulose and protease activity and, antagonistic activity against sugarcane phytopatogenic fungi. The PGP potential was determined using strains which were inoculated in sugarcane mini-set plants grown in sterile substrate and later in unsterilized soil pots. The 16S rRNA analyses demonstrated high bacterial diversity with the majority closely related to B. megaterium followed by B. aryabhattai and B. cereus. B. pumilus, B. velezensis, B. safensis, B. flexus and Paenibacillus taichungensis species were also identified. Most strains were able to produce indol, solubilize zinc oxide and presented cellulase activity, while phosphate solubilization and siderophore production was observed in only few strains. The strains LMC21, LMC44 and LMC48 presented high biocontrol activity against the sugarcane fungi Colletotrichum falcatum. The spore formation was observed for strains grown for 8 days in the HCT medium but not in presence of sugarcane juice. Some strains also accumulated higher biomass in sugarcane (sterile conditions) and a mixture of three Bacillus strains performed better in the soil-pot inoculation experiment. These findings show for the first time that many Bacillus species are present in the apoplastic fluid of sugarcane grown in Brazil and indicate that some strains have PGP and biocontrol potential for application as biofertilizer in sugarcane plants.","de Melo, LHV; Rocha, FYO; Vidal, MS; Gitahy, PD; Arruda, GM; Barreto, CP; Alves, PB; Ramos, ETD; Rossi, CN; Schwab, S; Sorte, PMFB; Avelar, JP; Baldani, JI",APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,2021,10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.103985,0.829200647092887,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99958857484264,4.1142515735969e-4,0.999999995464332,4.5356675082430806e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

11611,Consequences of season of prescribed burning on two spring-flowering terrestrial orchids and their endophytic fungi,"Prescribed burning is mandated in seasonally dry regions of the world to reduce fuel load and fire risk. This study investigated the effects of prescribed burning at different seasons on two Australian terrestrial orchids (Glossodia major R.Br. and Thelymitra pauciflora R.Br.) and their orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) to find the least damaging season for a burn. Burns were conducted mid-season in autumn, winter, spring and summer. Orchids were enumerated and measured and their OMF isolated during their flowering seasons. The OMF were grouped and identified using their internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and tested for sensitivity to smoke water. Orchid numbers decreased by up to 100% after autumn and winter burns but not spring and summer burns. Plant height, leaf and flower dimensions decreased between the two years. Fire reduced success in the isolation of OMF. The relative frequencies of ITS sequences of Serendipita Roberts from G. major (but not of Tulasnella asymmetrica Warcup and P.H.B. Talbot from Th. pauciflora) changed after burns. OMF from G. major were up to 100% inhibited by smoke water, twice the inhibition of the OMF from Th. pauciflora. Prescribed burning during active orchid growth damaged both the orchids and their OMF. The least damaging practical season for a prescribed burn was in late spring, soon after seed dispersal.","Jasinge, NU; Huynh, T; Lawrie, AC",AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,2018,10.1071/BT17179,0.757699415016943,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995584512037825,0.00441548796217513,0.999999826237164,1.73762836119806e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
18261,Plant Growth Promoting and Biocontrol Activity of Streptomyces spp. as Endophytes.,"There has been many recent studies on the use of microbial antagonists to control diseases incited by soilborne and airborne plant pathogenic bacteria and fungi, in an attempt to replace existing methods of chemical control and avoid extensive use of fungicides, which often lead to resistance in plant pathogens. In agriculture, plant growth-promoting and biocontrol microorganisms have emerged as safe alternatives to chemical pesticides. Streptomyces spp. and their metabolites may have great potential as excellent agents for controlling various fungal and bacterial phytopathogens. Streptomycetes belong to the rhizosoil microbial communities and are efficient colonizers of plant tissues, from roots to the aerial parts. They are active producers of antibiotics and volatile organic compounds, both in soil and in planta, and this feature is helpful for identifying active antagonists of plant pathogens and can be used in several cropping systems as biocontrol agents.

According to their life strategies, bacterial endophytes can be classified as ""obligate"" or ""facultative"". Reports that members of the genus Micromonospora, Gram-positive Actinobacteria, are normal occupants of nitrogen-fixing nodules has opened up a question as to what is the ecological role of these bacteria in interactions with nitrogen-fixing plants and whether it is in a process of adaptation from a terrestrial to a facultative endophytic life. The aim of this work was to analyse the genome sequence of Micromonospora lupini Lupac 08 isolated from a nitrogen fixing nodule of the legume Lupinus angustifolius and to identify genomic traits that provide information on this new plant-microbe interaction. The genome of M. lupini contains a diverse array of genes that may help its survival in soil or in plant tissues, while the high number of putative plant degrading enzyme genes identified is quite surprising since this bacterium is not considered a plant-pathogen. Functionality of several of these genes was demonstrated in vitro, showing that Lupac 08 degraded carboxymethylcellulose, starch and xylan. In addition, the production of chitinases detected in vitro, indicates that strain Lupac 08 may also confer protection to the plant.

6606,Bioremediation and microbial-assisted phytoremediation of heavy metals by endophytic Fusarium species isolated from Convolvulus arvensis,"Endophytic fungi are very prolific organisms associated with a wide range of host plants. Although they contribute to tolerance of their hosts against environmental stress, their role in response of plants to metal toxicity has not been thoroughly illuminated. Therefore, in this study, endophytic fungi were isolated from Convolvulus arvensis and their potential to bioremediate heavy metals from liquid media was assessed. Furthermore, the effect of the endophytic fungi on heavy metal tolerance, accumulation, and translocation by host plants were evaluated. The results revealed that Fusarium falciforme (MW898136) and Fusarium sp. (MW898137) possess a significant ability for bio-removal of cadmium from aqueous solutions as their tolerance indexes were >1. The bioaccumulation capacity reached 276.5 and 101.6 mu g/g with bioremediation percentages of 82.4% and 76.5%, respectively. Fusarium falciforme (MW898136) filtrates, in the presence of cadmium, stimulated the growth of Triticum aestivum, and dramatically decreased cadmium bioaccumulation from 30.18 to 7.06 mu g/g. The presence of F. falciforme (MW898136) in cadmium-stressed soil assisted Phaseolus vulgaris to produce more biomass, uptake higher amounts of cadmium by roots, and decreased the translocation of cadmium from roots to shoots. These results suggest that F. falciforme (MW898136) has the ability to immobilize cadmium and decrease its bioavailability in both liquid media and soil through absorption and/or accumulation.","Saad, MMG; Saad, MA; Saad, BS; Zakaria, FA; Husain, ARA; Abdelgaleil, SAM",BIOREMEDIATION JOURNAL,2024,10.1080/10889868.2022.2138256,0.973942275903405,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.968488112401846,0.0315118875981544,0.999972483198492,2.75168015081428e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11660,Influence of microbial associations on selenium localization and speciation in roots of Astragalus and Stanleya hyperaccumulators,"Selenium (Se) hyperaccumulator plants can accumulate and tolerate Se up to 1% of their dry weight. Since little is known about below-ground processes of Se uptake and metabolism in hyperaccumulators, X-ray absorption spectromicroscopy was used to characterize the chemical composition and spatial distribution of Se in roots of Astragalus and Stanleya hyperaccumulators. Selenium was present throughout the roots, with the highest levels in the cortex. The main form of Se (48-95%) in both species collected from naturally seleniferous soil was an organic C-Se-C compound, likely methyl-selenocysteine. In addition, surprisingly high fractions (up to 35%) of elemental Se (Se-0) were found, a form so far not reported in plants but commonly produced by Se-tolerant bacteria and fungi. Four fungi collected from hyperaccumulator roots were characterized with respect to their Se tolerance and ability to produce Se-0, and then used to inoculate hyperaccumulators in a controlled greenhouse study. The roots of the greenhouse-grown Astragalus and Stanleya contained mainly C-Se-C; in most plants no Se-0 was detected, with the exception of Astragalus nodules and roots of Astragalus inoculated with Alternaria astragali, an Se-0-producing fungus. Apparently, Se-0-producing endosymbionts including nitrogen-fixing bacteria and endophytic fungi or bacteria in the root can affect Se speciation in hyperaccumulator roots. Microbes that affect plant Se speciation may be applicable in phytoremediation and biofortification, especially if they are promiscuous and affect Se tolerance in crop species. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

10082,"Monascin and monascinol, azaphilonoid pigments from Mortierella polycephala AM1: in silico and in vitro targeting of the angiogenic VEGFR2 kinase","The fungus, Mortierella polycephala is one of the most productive sources of anticancer bioactive compounds namely those of pigment nature. During our investigation of the produced bioactive metabolites by the terrestrial M. polycephala AM1 isolated from Egyptian poultry feather waste, two main azaphilonoid pigments, monascin (1) and monascinol (2) were obtained as major products; their structures were identified by 1D (H-1&C-13) and 2D (H-1-H-1 COSY, HMBC) NMR and HRESI-MS spectroscopic data. Biologically, cytotoxic activities of these compounds were broadly studied compared with the fungal extract. To predict the biological target for the presumed antitumor activity, an in silico study was run toward three proteins, topoisomerase II alpha, topoisomerase II beta, and VEGFR2 kinase. Monascinol (2) was expected to be moderately active against VEGFR2 kinase without any anticipated inhibition toward topo II isoforms. The in vitro study confirmed the docked investigation consistently and introduced monascinol (2) rather than its counterpart (1) as a potent inhibitor to the tested VEGFR2 kinase. Taxonomically, the fungus was identified using morphological and genetic assessments.","Shaaban, M; El-Metwally, MM; Mekawey, AAI; Abdelwahab, AB; Soltan, MM",ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATURFORSCHUNG SECTION C-A JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES,2022,10.1515/znc-2021-0095,0.877842345427219,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.930266906969123,0.0697330930308769,0.999991632534905,8.36746509458308e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

These devices are environmentally friendly and can turn large quantities of organic material into renewable energy based on microbial diversity. Based on broad microbial diversity, it is necessary to obtain a comprehensive understanding of their resource distribution and to discover potential resources. In this study, sweet potato tissues were selected to isolate endophytic bacteria, and the electrochemical activity potential of those bacteria was evaluated by high-throughput screening with a WO3 nanoprobe. This study was screened and obtained a strain SHE10 with electrochemical performance from the rhizome of sweet potato by a WO3 nanoprobe, which was identified as Shinella zoogloeoides. After nearly 600 h of voltage monitoring and cyclic voltammetry analysis, the results showed that the average voltage of S. zoogloeoides SHE10 reached 122.5 mV in stationary period. The maximum power density is 78.3 ± 1.8 mW/m2, and the corresponding current density is 223.0 mA/m2. The good redox reaction also indicated that the strain had good electrical activity. Its electron transfer mode was diverse, but its power generation mechanism still needs to be further discussed.

3347,"Bottom-up effects of endophytic Beauveria bassiana on multitrophic interactions between the cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, and its natural enemies in melon","Entomopathogenic fungi are now known to have an endophytic capacity that induces a wide range of changes in the composition of plant nutrients and/or defensive compounds. These changes could influence interactions between the plant and higher trophic levels. In this study, we evaluated the predation/parasitism efficacy of larvae of the lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea, and the braconid parasitoid, Aphidius colemani, when offered aphids that had been challenged by the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. Aphids were either inoculated directly with a fungal suspension (lacewing bioassay only) or had been feeding on melon plants endophytically colonized by B. bassiana. Our results indicate that B. bassiana application did not significantly influence the number of aphid prey consumed by lacewings, or the time took them to consume each aphid. In a choice bioassay, C. carnea larvae preferred to feed on aphids reared on B. bassiana-colonized plants compared with control plants. In another choice assay, the number of aphids parasitized by A. colemani and their sex ratio were not influenced by whether the aphids had been feeding on B. bassiana-colonized plants or not. Our findings support the hypothesis that endophytic entomopathogenic fungi can be used in combination with other natural enemies, such as predators and parasitoids, in Integrated Pest Management programmes.","González-Mas, N; Cuenca-Medina, M; Gutiérrez-Sánchez, F; Quesada-Moraga, E",JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE,2019,10.1007/s10340-019-01098-5,0.988916495928567,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990252714240833,0.00974728575916648,0.999999999723866,2.76134115573257e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11189,Amylolytic and antibacterial activity of filamentous fungi isolated from the rhizosphere of different plants grown in the Tamanghasset region,"In the present study, we were interested in studying the amylolytic and antibacterial activity of some filamentous fungi isolated from the rhizosphere of cultivated plants in Tamanghasset re- gion. Consequently, 11 pure strains belonging to the different fungal genera were isolated Alternaria, Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Curvularia, Fusarium, Mucor and Penicillium. Positive result of amylolytic activity was revealed on all the isolated strains, with important hydrolysis zones of 54.33 +/- 1.15 mm, 54.00 +/- 3.61 mm, 52.00 +/- 6.08 mm and 51.33 +/- 15.01 mm for Aspergillus sp.1, Curvularia sp., Fusarium sp.2 and Mucor sp. respectively. In addition, analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the means of hydrolysis zones diameters shows that the values linked by the same letter do not show any significant difference at P < 0.05. Antibacterial activity of the isolated fungal was demonstrated by the agar cylinder technique against four pathogenic bacterial strains. The results showed a variability of the inhibition zones, thus the most important results were recorded against S. aureus, E. coli and K. pneumonia for all fungi which produced inhibition zones ranging from 15.33 +/- 0.00 to 23.66 +/- 1.71 mm. while all isolate had the lowest inhibition zone against P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, the obtained results indicated the isolated filamentous fungi have the potential to inhibit the four pathogenic bacterial strains, S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumonia and P. aeruginosa, while simultaneously showed significant amylolytic activity.","Abouamama, S; Anis, B; Abir, S; Maroua, H; Sirine, B",HELIYON,2023,10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e14350,0.974435975410295,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.946777731055574,0.0532222689444257,0.999958665493909,4.13345060907844e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12971,Endophytic fungi associated with medicinal plants; [Fungos endofíticos associados a plantas medicinais],"With the use of medicinal plants in infusions, syrups, dyes, unguents, among other forms, it is expected that endophytic fungi, present inside the plants but not causing diseases, become components of these products, especially when used in natura. In addition, endophytic fungi can produce toxic substances to the users or even modify the plant metabolism, altering the medicinal composition and properties, as well as the quality of the stored and commercialized product. Therefore, the aim of this study was to isolate and identify the endophytic flora from eleven randomly chosen medicinal species.

10361,Relation of the soil microbiota of cork oak groves and surrounding grasslands to tree decline,"Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) form low-density silvopastoral systems of great ecosystemic and socioeconomic importance in the Mediterranean Basin, as they provide bark of great industrial value. Since the 1950s, these trees have been increasingly suffering from a deadly disorder known as decline, due to different biotic and abiotic factors. Associated with these forests, grasslands of great pastoral value and as carbon sequestrators develop. The aim of this work was to study the bacterial and fungal diversity present in the soils of healthy and diseased cork oaks (due to decline) and their associated grasslands, an ecosystem whose microbiome has not been studied so far by metagenomics. Soil samples were collected from cork oak forests in southern Spain and their microbial diversity was analyzed by metabarcoding with Illumina MiSeq. With respect to bacterial families, no differences were reported between cork oak forest soils and their associated grasslands, possibly due to the presence of endemic bacteria and similar environmental conditions. However, there were differences in fungal diversity between healthy cork oak forests and their associated grasslands. In the healthy cork oak soils, the families Gemmatimonadaceae and Nocardioidaceae were massively present, while in the diseased soils the fungal genus Geminibasidium was found. Regarding the functional niche, healthy cork oaks presented mainly ectomycorrhizae in their soils, while their associated grasslands presented fungal endophytes, less present in areas with diseased trees. Therefore, fungi, but not bacteria, present in the soils of cork oaks and associated grasslands could play a key role in the presence/absence of decline in cork oaks.","Marcos-Romero, JC; Poveda, J; Diez, JJ",APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,2025,10.1016/j.apsoil.2025.106165,0.901543293106566,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.847300766747533,0.152699233252467,0.999988979958498,1.10200415024408e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
6907,EXAMINATION OF MICROORGANISMS AND DETERIORATION RESISTANCE MECHANISMS ASSOCIATED WITH VELVETLEAF SEED,"Annual weed seeds persist in cultivated soils due to seed dormancy and possibly to resistance to microbial attack. [Microbial attack may be useful as a means of biological control of weeds.] The relationships between microorganisms and velvetleaf (A. theophrasti Medic.) seeds were investigated to elucidate the deterioration resistance mechanisms in this species. Microorganisms were isolated from velvetleaf seeds matured on the plant and from seeds dispersed on the soil surface. An association of sporulating fungi comprised of Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Epicoccum purpurascens and Fusarium spp. was consistently found on the seed surface. This association persisted on seeds after dispersal to the soil. Seed deterioration was infrequent despite abundant microbial growth on the seed surface. About 80% of the bacteria isolated from within seeds were antagonistic to externally seed-borne fungi. The proportion of surface-sterilized seeds with internal fungi was 10%, indicating the seed coat acts as a barrier to most fungal invasions. When the seed coat was punctured, however, seed deterioration by the seedborne microorganisms readily occurred. Seed coat extracts contained tannin-like compounds that inhibited in vitro growth of several bacterial and fungal isolates. Histochemical examination of seed sections revealed localization of tannin-like compounds in the palisade layer of the seed coat and the chalazal area of the embryo. It is suggested that deterioration of velvetleaf seeds by microorgannisms is limited by the dense layer of palisade cells in the seed coat, chemical compounds within the seed coat that are inhibitory to certain microorganisms outside the seed and antagonistic bacteria located within the seed. Resistances to microbial attack may act together with seed dormancy to maintain velvetleaf seed longevity in soil.","KREMER, RJ; HUGHES, LB; ALDRICH, RJ",AGRONOMY JOURNAL,1984,10.2134/agronj1984.00021962007600050009x,0.976217689401481,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998642844637807,0.00135715536219338,0.99999999911454,8.85459594535121e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Here we present the L. sativa transcriptome and metabolome from the same experimental approach. Three distinct interaction zones were sampled and compared to a blank (non-inoculated) sample: symptomless zone 1, zone 2 showing light brown discoloration, and a dark brown zone 3 characterized by necrotic lesions. Throughout the interaction, we observed a massive reprogramming of the L. sativa transcriptome, with 9231 unique genes matching the threshold criteria for differential expression. The lettuce transcriptome of the light brown zone 2 presents the most dissimilar profile compared to the uninoculated zone 4, marking the main stage of interaction. Transcripts putatively encoding several essential proteins that are involved in maintaining jasmonic acid and auxin homeostasis were found to be negatively regulated.

10732,Positive plant-soil feedbacks of the invasive Impatiens glandulifera and their effects on above-ground microbial communities,"Impatiens glandulifera is one of the most widespread invasive plant species in the UK. Although aspects of its biology are known, there is little information about its association with microbial communities, both above ground and below ground. Furthermore, it is unknown whether this species exhibits any form of plant-soil feedback (PSF), commonly seen in other invasive weeds. We conducted a PSF experiment, in which plants of I. glandulifera were grown in soil that supported the species and compared with plants grown in a control soil from the same locality. Soil nutrients were measured, and the soil and foliar microbial communities were assessed. Impatiens glandulifera grew larger and faster in conditioned soil compared with the control. Higher levels of phosphate were also found in conditioned soils. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) colonisation was lower in conditioned soils, suggesting that I.glandulifera may rapidly alter AMF communities in invaded areas. PSFs had a significant effect on the foliar endophyte community, with clear separation of species between conditioned and control soils. These results show that I.glandulifera displayed a positive PSF and the PSF mechanism extended beyond the soil microbial community to affect foliar endophytes. The observed increase in endophytes in plants grown in conditioned soil could enhance resistance to herbivory, thus further accentuating the invasive properties of this species.","Pattison, Z; Rumble, H; Tanner, RA; Jin, L; Gange, AC",WEED RESEARCH,2016,10.1111/wre.12200,0.984472581932782,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995754588110899,0.00424541188910067,0.99999990458667,9.54133301256377e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

6927,Culturable endophytic fungal diversity in the cadmium hyperaccumulator Solanum nigrum L. and their role in enhancing phytoremediation,"In this study, the endophytic fungal community associated with Solanum nigrum was isolated and characterized for cadmium (Cd) tolerance and host plant growth modulation under Cd contamination for the first time. In total, 42 culturable endophytic fungal isolates representing various morphotypes were isolated, among which 14 different genera of the fungal phylum Ascomycota were identified based on the analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rRNA gene. Among the identified genera, Colletotrichum (18%) represented the dominant genus followed by Alternaria (14%), and Fusarium (14%). The majority of the endophytic isolates were sensitive to a lower concentration (0.5 mM) of Cd. However, Glomerella truncata PDL-1, and Phomopsis fukushii PDL-10 showed the highest tolerance to a concentration gradient of Cd (0.5-2 mM). Owing to the levels of Cd tolerance detected, in order to simulate a tripartite plant-microbe-metal interaction, S. nigrum plants were inoculated with PDL-1 and PDL-10 under Cd spiking of 0, 5,15, and 25 mg kg(-1). The results indicated that PDL-10 inoculated plants had significantly higher Cd content in shoots as well as in roots than observed in the PDL-1 inoculated plants. Additionally, irrespective of Cd stress, PDL-1 and PDL-10 inoculation significantly improved plant growth attributes such as shoot and root length, chlorophyll content, and fresh and dry shoot/root weight as compared to those of non-inoculated control plants. The results of this study highlight the possible role of fungal endophytes harbored inside S. nigrum, which has the potential to improve the efficiency of phytoremediation or phytostabilization in the cleanup of Cd-contaminated soil.

5491,Effects of Potassium Fertilization Application on Microbial Community and Transcriptome in Sugarcane Tillering Stages,"Increased potassium application is known to enhance sugar content, drought resistance, and disease resistance in sugarcane, with plant resistance often closely linked to the plant microbiome. However, limited research has been conducted on the changes in root microbial community structure and transcriptome expression following potassium fertilization in sugarcane. To explore the impact of potassium application on sugarcane root microbial characteristics and the transcriptome changes, this study collected sugarcane root samples at the tillering stage under four potassium fertilization gradients. Through analyses of the microbiome, the results showed that appropriate potassium fertilization can influence the retention of soil nutrients in the soil and alter soil enzyme activities. Additionally, potassium fertilization has a significant impact on the microbial community during the tillering stage, Myxococcota, Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Actinobacteriota were enriched at different potassium concentration gradients in bacterial, while Ascomycota, Mortierellomycota, and Basidiomycota were enriched in fungi. Transcriptomic analysis indicated that, compared to the control, at a potassium application rate of 150 kg/hm(2), 3,895 genes were upregulated, and 2,045 genes were downregulated in the sugarcane root transcriptome. Further Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation showed that potassium application significantly enriched genes related to cellular chemical homeostasis, cellular ion homeostasis, and cellular metal ion homeostasis. Additionally, significant changes were observed in metabolic pathways, including glycerolipid metabolism, phosphatidylinositol signaling system, and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. This study provides valuable insights into the ecological mechanisms through which potassium application influences microbial communities and transcriptome gene expression, offering theoretical support for improving nutrient utilization efficiency and promoting sustainable sugarcane production.","Zhang, ZF; Dao, J; Wang, YT; Ai, J; Liu, JY; Deng, J; Zhao, Y",TROPICAL PLANT BIOLOGY,2025,10.1007/s12042-025-09396-2,0.975510522601913,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992836057700836,0.00716394229916376,0.999999999511462,4.88537765797048e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12297,Interaction studies of Serendipita indica and Zhihengliuella sp. ISTPL4 and their synergistic role in growth promotion in rice,"Rapid urbanization and globalization demand increasing agricultural productivity. Soil nutrient supply capacity is continuously decreasing due to soil erosion, degradation, salt deposition, undesired element, metal deposition, water scarcity, and an uneven nutrient delivery system. Rice cultivation requires a large amount of water which is becoming detrimental due to these activities. There is a need to increase its productivity. Microbial inoculants are becoming increasingly important in achieving sustainable agricultural production systems. The current study was conducted to investigate the interaction between the root endophytic fungus Serendipita indica (S. indica) and the actinobacterium Zhihengliuella sp. ISTPL4 (Z. sp. ISTPL4) and their synergistic effects on the growth of rice (Oryza sativa L). Both S. indica and Z. sp. ISTPL4 showed positive interactions. Growth of S. indica was observed at different days after Z. sp. ISTPL4 inoculation, and stimulated growth of S. indica was observed when Z. sp. ISTPL4 was inoculated at 5 dafi (days after fungal inoculation). Z. sp. ISTPL4 promoted the growth of S. indica as it increased spore germination. Furthermore, confocal and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses showed a 27% increase in the spore size of S. indica in the presence of Z. sp. ISTPL4. In a liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis increased production of alanine and glutamic acid was observed in their sequential co-culture as compared with individual cultures. Sequential inoculation of S. indica and Z. sp. ISTPL4 significantly increased the biochemical and physical characteristics of rice as compared with their individual inoculum. Biochemical parameters such as chlorophyll content, total soluble sugar, and flavonoid content in the rice increased by up to 57%, 47%, and 39%, respectively, in the presence of the combined inoculum of S. indica and Z. sp. ISTPL4. This will be the first study, to the best of our knowledge, which shows the fungus and actinobacterium interaction and their synergistic roles in the growth promotion of rice. Furthermore, this novel combination can also be used to boost the growth of other crops to increase the agricultural yield.","Sharma, N; Dabral, S; Tyagi, J; Yadav, G; Aggarwal, H; Joshi, NC; Varma, A; Koul, M; Choudhary, DK; Mishra, A",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2023,10.3389/fpls.2023.1155715,0.746879363540674,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991268353878221,0.00873164612177879,0.999999994995781,5.004218817106221e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
8332,Ectomycorrhizal and endophytic fungi associated with Alnus glutinosa growing in a saline area of central Poland,"Alnus glutinosa (black alder) is a mycorrhizal pioneer tree species with tolerance to high concentrations of salt in the soil and can therefore be considered to be an important tree for the regeneration of forests areas devastated by excessive salt. However, there is still a lack of information about the ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) associated with mature individuals of A. glutinosa growing in natural saline conditions. The main objective of this study was to test the effect of soil salinity and other physicochemical parameters on root tips colonized by EMF, as well as on the species richness and diversity of an EMF community associated with A. glutinosa growing in natural conditions. We identified a significant effect of soil salinity (expressed as electrical conductivity: ECe and EC1:5) on fungal taxa but not on the total level of EM fungal colonization on roots. Increasing soil salinity promoted dark-coloured EMF belonging to the order Thelephorales (Tomentella sp. and Thelephora sp.). These fungi are also commonly found in soils polluted with heavy-metal. The ability of these fungi to grow in contaminated soil may be due to the presence of melanine, a natural dark pigment and common wall component of the Thelephoraceae that is known to act as a protective interface between fungal metabolism and biotic and abiotic environmental stressors. Moreover, increased colonization of fungi belonging to the class of Leotiomycetes and Sordiomycetes, known as endophytic fungal species, was observed at the test sites, that contained a larger content of total phosphorus. This observation confirms the ability of commonly known endophytic fungi to form ectomycorrhizal structures on the roots of A. glutinosa under saline stress conditions.","Thiem, D; Piernik, A; Hrynkiewicz, K",SYMBIOSIS,2018,10.1007/s13199-017-0512-5,0.642647051881132,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.918171001224963,0.0818289987750372,0.999986857573773,1.31424262274082e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
9663,Chloropupukeananin and Pestalofone C Regulate Autophagy through AMPK and Glycolytic Pathway,"Chloropupukeananin (RN56-6) and Pestalofone C (RN56-49), isolated from the culture of the plant endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis fici, have been shown cytotoxic, anti-HIV, and antimicrobial activities. However, the underlying mechanism of their regulatory roles in autophagy remains unknown. In the present study, we revealed that both compounds increased the formation of autophagosome and enhanced autophagic flux. While RN56-6 upregulated the expression of HK2, one of the key rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis, the inhibition of glycolysis chemically attenuated RN56-6-induced autophagy. On the contrary, RN56-49 downregulated the expression of HK2, while the suppression of glycolysis promoted RN56-49-dependent autophagic flux. Moreover, the knockdown of AMPK beta 1, a scaffolding subunit of AMPK, decreased autophagy induced by these two compounds. Collectively, these findings revealed that RN56-6 and RN56-49 regulated autophagic process through AMPK and glycolytic pathway.","Guo, LF; Zhang, CN; Gao, Q; Hou, BL; Liu, L; Yang, HY; Jiang, XJ",CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY,2020,10.1002/cbdv.201900583,0.738768483899297,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.974202560634168,0.0257974393658318,0.999999997412954,2.58704591082903e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

Endophytic fungal communities associated with stems and leaves of healthy S. microphylla and S. corniculata plants were determined from June to October in 2009. The plants were growing in alkaline land in Songyuan City, Jilin Province in China. Endophytic fungal composition varied between the two plants, however Alternaria spp. and Phoma spp. colonized both plant species. The fungal diversity and colonization rate were highest in September. Different fungal species inhabited different tissues and a few species were overlapping between stems and leaves. Although species of Phoma chrysanthemicola were isolated from both stem and leaves in September, the isolation frequency in stems was significantly higher than in leaves. Pigmented dematiaceous endophytic fungi were particularly common in the halophytes and they may play an important ecological role for survival and stress resistance of the plant species.","Sun, Y; Wang, Q; Lu, XD; Okane, I; Kakishima, M",MYCOSPHERE,2011,NA,0.91216118038255,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.641906814602956,0.358093185397044,0.999970906940433,2.9093059566665e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

Notably, the dimeric isocoumarins (1-9) possess a unique linkage, where the phenyl of one monomer is connected to the lactone of another. The methods for determining the configurations of both the monomeric and dimeric isocoumarins within this class were proposed, leading to the correction of the configurations of two previously reported isocoumarins.

21077,Problem of development of resistance to some fungicide active substances intended for suppressing of cercospora beticola Sacc.; [Problematika vzniku rezistence cercospora beticola Sacc. Na některé účinné látky fungicidů],"Leaf spot caused by the pathogenic fungus Cercospora beticola Sacc. is the most important disease of sugar beet. The disease is very aggressive to sugar beet and in favorable conditions it expands rapidly and can completely destroy sugar beet leaves. Plants, whose leaves were destroyed, develop new leaves (retro-vegetation), however, they are weak and result in lower yields and sugar content. Generally, the occurrence and intensity of the attack by this fungus mostly depends on weather conditions during summer growing season. The amount of damage depends on the resistance of the genotype and all provided agro-technical measures. Agro-technical protection measures include sowing healthy and fungicide-protected seeds, a proper crop rotation and timely and proper execution of procedures including tillage, fertilization and weed protection. The use of fungicides in our terms of production is certainly necessary no matter whether we sow sensitive or tolerant sugar beet hybrids. However, Cercospora beticola is a parasite which has high possibility to develop resistance to fungicides. The reduced susceptibility or resistance is reflected in the reduced effectiveness of fungicides to control leaf spots and is recorded in almost all countries where this disease occurs. Resistance or reduced susceptibility of these pathogenic fungi to fungicides is related to the mass application of systemic fungicides, particularly from the group of strobilurins. The research was conducted in 2014 and 2015 on Mollic Gleysols and Eutric brown soil. The experiment was set up in a split-block scheme with 14 different variants in 4 repetitions: A. soil type (A1 – Mollic Gleysols; A2 – Eutric brown soil); B. treatment with fungicides (B1 – control; B2 – one time during vegetation – Rias 300 EC, 0.35 l ha-1; B3 – one time during vegetation – Bravo 720 SC, 1.5 l ha-1; B4 – one time during vegetation – Sphere 535 SC, 0.35 l ha-1; B5 – two times during vegetation – Rias 300 EC, 0.35 l ha-1 + Duett ultra, 0.6 l ha-1; B6 – two times during vegetation – Bravo 720 SC, 1.5 l ha-1 + Duett ultra, 0.6 l ha-1; B7 – two times during vegetation – Sphere 535 SC, 0.35 l ha-1 + Duett ultra, 0.6 l ha-1).

4368,Cultivable Root-Symbiotic Bacteria of a Pioneer Ericaceous Dwarf Shrub Colonizing Volcanic Deposits and Their Potential to Promote host Fitness,"Ericaceous plants (Ericaceae, the heath family) establish complex symbioses with soil-borne microorganisms that facilitate their survival in challenging environments such as nutrient-impoverished heathlands, heavy metal-polluted soils, and inert volcanic rock substrates. While the symbiosis with the ericoid mycorrhizal (ErM) fungi has attracted significant attention, little is known about the endophytic bacteria and how they affect fitness of their ericaceous hosts. In this study, we isolated and identified endophytic bacteria from hair roots of Gaultheria poeppigii colonizing volcanic deposits at a site in the Chilean southern Andes. In addition, their in vitro capacity to solubilize phosphate, produce exopolysaccharides, siderophores, ammonia, indole acetic acid (IAA), and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase activity was evaluated. In total, 74 isolates were obtained, belonging to the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria and the genera Paraburkholderia, Paenibacillus, Variovorax, Bacillus, Leifsonia, and Arthrobacter. Only two Paraburkholderia sp. isolates showed phosphate solubilization. Siderophore production was detected in six isolates, with the highest production detected in the Variovorax paradoxus. All strains produced ammonia and IAA in different amounts and six displayed ACC deaminase activity, the highest being detected in V. paradoxus GC55. The results of our biocontrol assay showed that V. paradoxus GC51 had the highest percentages of inhibition of common phytopathogens with values ranging from 65 to 100%. To our best knowledge, this is the first report on the cultivable bacteria colonizing the hair roots of ericaceous plants growing in volcanic deposits and our results suggest that at least some of them might promote the host growth and confer protection against pathogens. We suggest that not only the ErM fungi but also the root-symbiotic bacteria contribute to the remarkable resilience of ericaceous plants in challenging environments such as volcanic deposits.","Fuentes-Quiroz, A; Herrera, H; Alvarado, R; Sagredo-Saez, C; Isabel-Mujica, M; Vohník, M; Rolli, E",JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION,2024,10.1007/s42729-024-01758-1,0.774019408870911,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998646465694149,0.00135353430585107,0.999999571459246,4.28540753771856e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
6390,Differences and biocontrol potential of haustorial endophytic fungi from Taxillus Chinensis on different host plants,"BackgroundTo explore the community composition and diversity of the endophytic fungi in Taxillus chinensis, samples of the parasites growing on seven different hosts, Morus alba, Prunus salicina, Phellodendron chinense, Bauhinia purpurea, Dalbergia odorifera, Diospyros kaki and Dimocarpus longan, were isolated. The strains were identified by their morphological characteristics and their internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences.Results150 different endophytic fungi were isolated from the haustorial roots of the seven hosts with a total isolation rate of 61.24%. These endophytic fungi were found to belong to 1 phylum, 2 classes, 7 orders, 9 families, 11 genera and 8 species. Among of them, Pestalotiopsis, Neopestalotiopsis and Diaporthe were the dominant genera, accounting for 26.67, 17.33 and 31.33% of the total number of strains, respectively. Diversity and similarity analyses showed that the endophytic fungi isolated from D. longan (H'=1.60) had the highest diversity index. The highest richness indexes were found in M. alba and D. odorifera (both 2.23). The evenness index of D. longan was the highest (0.82). The similarity coefficient of D. odorifera was the most similar to D. longan and M. alba (33.33%), while the similarity coefficient of P. chinense was the lowest (7.69%) with M. alba and D. odorifera. Nine strains showed antimicrobial activities. Among them, Pestalotiopsis sp., N. parvum and H. investiens showed significant antifungal activity against three fungal phytopathogens of medicinal plants. At the same time, the crude extracts from the metabolites of the three endophytic fungi had strong inhibitory effects on the three pathogens. Pestalotiopsis sp., N. parvum and H. investiens had the strongest inhibitory effects of S. cucurbitacearum, with inhibitory rates of 100%, 100% and 81.51%, respectively. In addition, N. parvum had a strong inhibitory effect on D. glomerata and C. cassicola, with inhibitory rates of 82.35% and 72.80%, respectively.ConclusionsThese results indicate that the species composition and diversity of endophytic fungi in the branches of T. chinensis were varied in the different hosts and showed good antimicrobial potential in the control of plant pathogens.","Song, LS; Huo, J; Wan, LY; Pan, LM; Jiang, N; Fu, J; Wei, SG; He, LL",BMC MICROBIOLOGY,2023,10.1186/s12866-023-02878-x,0.840296485279478,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998102327558493,0.00189767244150704,0.999971670345428,2.83296545717793e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Alien material was removed from the non-sterilized plant samples before being submitted for extraction. It was observed that extracts collected in different spots showed different biological activities. Extracts ADS04(10.66 +/- 0,17mm) and ADS14(11.37 +/- 0,11mm) were active against Staphylococcus aureus, according to the diffusion in bioautography assay. They showed significant antioxidant activity and inhibited AChE; the cytotoxicity observed to the human breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were higher than in normal cell line MCF-10A. ADS04 was 7.62 times more cytotoxic to MCF-7, and ADS14 was 2.03 times more cytotoxic to MDA-MB-231 than to MCF-10A. The extracts showed similar cytotoxicity between PC-3, a human prostate cancer cell line, and MCF-10A.

14318,Cultural characteristics of fungal endophyte from 3 locoweed species in China,"Locoweeds contain swainsonine-producing fungal endophytes. Endophytes in several locoweed species in China are known to belong to the same taxonomic species of fungus. However, since these endophytes are isolated within their respective hosts and vertically transmitted to seed of the next plant generation, it is likely that the fungal endophytes of the various locoweed species have developed distinctive biological traits. Colony growth rate and morphological characteristics of endophytes from Oxytropis glabra, O. ochrocephala and O. kansuensis (strains LYZ0091, LYZ0093 and LYZ0109, respectively) were studied under different temperature and pH regimes and grown on various media to test this hypothesis. It was found that: 1) The maximum temperature for growth differed between strains (LYZ0109 ceased growth at 30℃, while LYZ0091 and LYZ0093 continued to grow at 30℃); 2) The optimum temperatures for colony growth were 20, 25 and 25℃, respectively, for LYZ0091, LYZ0093, and LYZ0109; 3) The growth rate of LYZ0091 at 5, 10 and 15℃ was significantly (P<0.05) higher than LYZ0109, while significantly (P<0.05) lower than LYZ0109 at 20 and 25℃. 4) No significant growth difference between fungal strains was found over the pH range pH 4 to pH 11; 5) The colony growth rate of strain LYZ0109 was significantly (P<0.05) higher than that of LYZ0091 on NA, PCA, PDA, PSA and WHDA media for most growth measures; 6) No conidia were produced by any fungal strain in any of temperature, pH and media combinations tested; 7) Hyphae of LYZ0091 and LYZ0109 were waved, and seldom produced chlamydospores; hyphae of LYZ093 were straight with plentiful chlamydospores arranged as tree-like structures from the media bottom to the surface.

1052,Different response of perennial ryegrass-Epichloe endophyte symbiota to the elevated concentration of heavy metals in soil,"The phenomenon of plant mutualistic symbiosis with microbes may have a positive effect on the improvement of plant tolerance to environmental stresses as well as on the ability of plants to accumulate heavy metal (HM) ions from soil. The influence of Epichloe fungal endophyte (Ascomycota, Clavicipitaceae) on perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) plants grown in the presence of elevated concentrations of HM ions (Cd2+, Pb2+, and Cu2+) in soil was studied. The presence of Epichloe in the host grass tissues resulted in different accumulation of HM ions in the aboveground parts of the plants. In some cases, endophyte infection positively affected ryegrass ability to accumulate HM ions from soil. In plants with (E +) and without (E-) endophytes, the hormesis effect was induced by the elevated concentration of Cu2+ ions, resulting in better growth and photosynthesis, as examined by measurements of Chl a fluorescence. The obtained results indicate that based on the laboratory evaluation of the efficiency of HM accumulation, we were able to choose the best associations of perennial ryegrass with endophytes for HM phytoremediation.","Zurek, G; Wiewióra, B; Rybka, K; Prokopiuk, K",JOURNAL OF APPLIED GENETICS,2022,10.1007/s13353-021-00661-0,0.804978530815427,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98604497456202,0.01395502543798,0.999999984953641,1.50463592696326e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

10871,Mycofumigation by the Volatile Organic Compound-Producing Fungus Muscodor albus Induces Bacterial Cell Death through DNA Damage,"Muscodor albus belongs to a genus of endophytic fungi that inhibit and kill other fungi, bacteria, and insects through production of a complex mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). This process of mycofumigation has found commercial application for control of human and plant pathogens, but the mechanism of the VOC toxicity is unknown. Here, the mode of action of these volatiles was investigated through a series of genetic screens and biochemical assays. A single-gene knockout screen revealed high sensitivity for Escherichia coli lacking enzymes in the pathways of DNA repair, DNA metabolic process, and response to stress when exposed to the VOCs of M. albus. Furthermore, the sensitivity of knockouts involved in the repair of specific DNA alkyl adducts suggests that the VOCs may induce alkylation. Evidence of DNA damage suggests that these adducts lead to breaks during DNA replication or transcription if not properly repaired. Additional cytotoxicity profiling indicated that during VOC exposure, E. coli became filamentous and demonstrated an increase in cellular membrane fluidity. The volatile nature of the toxic compounds produced by M. albus and their broad range of inhibition make this fungus an attractive biological agent. Understanding the antimicrobial effects and the VOC mode of action will inform the utility and safety of potential mycofumigation applications for M. albus.","Alpha, CJ; Campos, M; Jacobs-Wagner, C; Strobela, SA",APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,2015,10.1128/AEM.03294-14,0.994493293892069,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.988392716302032,0.0116072836979676,0.999998849209162,1.15079083828906e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

In order to endow PCA with phloem mobility and also enhance its antifungal activity, thirty-two phenazine-1-carboxylic acid-N-phenylalanine esters conjugates were designed and synthesized by conjugating PCA with the active structure N-acylalanine methyl ester of Metalaxyl. All target compounds were characterized by H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR and HRMS. The antifungal evaluation results revealed that several target compounds exhibited moderate to potent antifungal activities against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Bipolaris sorokiniana, Phytophthora parasitica, Phytophthora citrophthora. In particular, compound F7 displayed excellent antifungal activity against S. sclerotiorum with an EC50 value of 6.57 mu g/mL, which was superior to that of Metalaxyl. Phloem mobility study in castor bean system indicated good phloem mobility for the target compounds F1-F16. Particularly, compound F2 exhibited excellent phloem mobility; the content of compound F2 in the phloem sap of castor bean was 19.12 mu mol/L, which was six times higher than Metalaxyl (3.56 mu mol/L). The phloem mobility tests under different pH culture solutions verified the phloem translocation of compounds related to the ""ion trap"" effect. The distribution of the compound F2 in tobacco plants further suggested its ambimobility in the phloem, exhibiting directional accumulation towards the apical growth point and the root.

6894,Application of Stemphylium lycopersici Extracts Immobilized on MCM-48type Mesoporous Materials as Biocatalysts for Monoacylglycerol Production,"Monoacylglycerols are eco-friendly and inexpensive emulsifiers with a range of applications. The traditional synthetic route is not eco-friendly, while enzymatic catalysis offers milder reaction conditions and higher selectivity. However, its application still is limited due to the costs. In this context, endophytic fungi can be source to new biocatalysts with enhanced catalytic activity. Based on this perspective, the aim of this study was perform the synthesis of MAG's through transesterification reactions of solketal and different vinyl esters, using crude and immobilized lipolytic extracts from the endophytic fungi Stemphylium lycopersici, isolated from Humiria balsamifera. The reactions were conducted using 100 mg of biocatalyst, 1 mmol of substrates, 9 : 1 n-heptane/acetone, at 40 degrees C, 200 rpm for 96 h. In the reactions using the ILE and stearate, laureate and decanoate vinyl esters it was possible to obtain the correspondent products with conversion rates of 52-75 %. Also, according to the structure drivers used in MCM-48 synthesis, different morphologies and conversions rates were observed.

12839,The effects of fungal root endophytes on plant growth: a meta-analysis,"Fungal root endophytes are plant associates that colonize root tissue internally without causing any obvious harm to their host. Although ubiquitous, this relationship is not well understood. Our objectives were to determine the effects of fungal root endophyte inoculation on plant biomass and nitrogen concentration by conducting an extensive meta-analysis. We also explored the effects of experimental conditions on the host-endophyte relationship. We performed analyses weighted with non-parametric variance on plant response to root endophytes from the Ascomycetes (excluding the Clavacipitaceae), including categorical analyses of 21 experimental factors, ranging from the identity of the host and the endophyte, to the composition of the growing medium. The response of total biomass to endophyte inoculation was 18 % lower than non-inoculated controls, while individually, root biomass, shoot biomass, and nitrogen concentration responses to endophyte inoculation were neutral. The identities of both the host and the endophyte had an influence, as did the original source of the endophyte (whether or not the isolate used originated from the same host species). Experimental conditions also influenced the plant-endophyte relationship, with the most important being the availability and sources of carbon and organic nitrogen, particularly peat moss. Although our analysis demonstrates that overall plant biomass and nitrogen concentration responses to ascomycetous root endophyte inoculation is neutral to negative, these results are somewhat confounded by among-study differences in experimental conditions, which undoubtedly contribute to the high levels of variability in plant response seen in the literature.","Mayerhofer, MS; Kernaghan, G; Harper, KA",MYCORRHIZA,2013,10.1007/s00572-012-0456-9,0.974432403588477,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.961760612468358,0.0382393875316416,0.99999743091817,2.56908182982851e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5795,An endophyte from salt-adapted Pokkali rice confers salt-tolerance to a salt-sensitive rice variety and targets a unique pattern of genes in its new host,"Endophytes, both of bacterial and fungal origin, are ubiquitously present in all plants. While their origin and evolution are enigmatic, there is burgeoning literature on their role in promoting growth and stress responses in their hosts. We demonstrate that a salt-tolerant endophyte isolated from salt-adapted Pokkali rice, a Fusarium sp., colonizes the salt-sensitive rice variety IR-64, promotes its growth under salt stress and confers salinity stress tolerance to its host. Physiological parameters, such as assimilation rate and chlorophyll stability index were higher in the colonized plants. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed 1348 up-regulated and 1078 down-regulated genes in plants colonized by the endophyte. Analysis of the regulated genes by MapMan and interaction network programs showed that they are involved in both abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, and code for proteins involved in signal perception (leucine-rich repeat proteins, receptor-like kinases) and transduction (Ca2+ and calmodulin-binding proteins), transcription factors, secondary metabolism and oxidative stress scavenging. For nine genes, the data were validated by qPCR analysis in both roots and shoots. Taken together, these results show that salt-adapted Pokkali rice varieties are powerful sources for the identification of novel endophytes, which can be used to confer salinity tolerance to agriculturally important, but salt-sensitive rice varieties.","Sampangi-Ramaiah, MH; Jagadheesh; Dey, P; Jambagi, S; Kumari, MMV; Oelmüller, R; Nataraja, KN; Ravishankar, KV; Ravikanth, G; Shaanker, RU",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2020,10.1038/s41598-020-59998-x,0.939829762134649,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.977303871424997,0.0226961285750026,0.999999939413803,6.05861968372423e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12869,Do coffee varieties and shade trees matter for management of leaf rust disease in India Evidence for household farmers,"This paper assesses how Arabica coffee varieties and shade trees affect the management of coffee leaf rust (CLR) by chemical controls (Bordeaux mixture and systemic fungicides). All estimations are based on a new set of sample household survey data involving 575 Arabica coffee farmers (comprising 90% of smallholders) and collected in the traditional coffee growing regions of India. Estimates show that, with no shade trees, the probability of management of CLR by chemical sprays is highest for farmers who cultivate the S.795 variety, and lowest for those who grow the Selection.9 variety. This result is shown to be (1) valid if more than one variety is grown by the same farmer and (2) consistent with the requirement of more chemical controls for CLR-susceptible varieties than for CLR-resistant varieties. Further, of the four main structures of shade trees canopy identified, mixed shade canopy (a combination of various tree species with different height) is the structure that has the least influence on chemical control. When coffee varieties and shade trees are considered together, Selection.9 variety under mixed shade canopy appeared as the best combination for an effective management of CLR. These results unambiguously show that coffee varieties and shade trees do matter for farmers' management of CLR by chemical controls. The overall approach and results have implications for other coffee growing countries in Asia, Central and South America and Africa. © 2013 Taylor and Francis.",Narayana M.R.,Forests Trees and Livelihoods,2013,10.1080/14728028.2013.846563,0.906997888248117,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.710577641608142,0.289422358391858,0.999971797215599,2.82027844012989e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

12443,"Synthesis, Characterization, and Optimization of Green Silver Nanoparticles Using Neopestalotiopsis clavispora and Evaluation of Its Antibacterial, Antibiofilm, and Genotoxic Effects","Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been used in a variety of biomedical applications in the last two decades, including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer treatments. The present study highlights the extracellular synthesis of silver nanoparticles AgNPs using Neopestalotiopsis clavispora MH244410.1 and its antibacterial, antibiofilm, and genotoxic properties. Locally isolated N. clavispora MH244410.1 was identified by Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of nuclear ribosomal DNA. Optimization of synthesized AgNPs was performed by using various parameters (pH (2, 4, 7, 9 and 12), temperature (25, 35 and 45 degrees C), and substrate concentration (0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2 and 0.25 mM)). After 72 hours of incubation in dark conditions, the best condition for the biosynthesis of AgNPs was determined as 0.25 mM metal concentration at pH 12 and 35 degrees C. Fungal synthesized AgNPs were characterized via spectroscopic and microscopic techniques such as Fouirer Transform Infrared Spectrophotometer (FTIR), UV-Visible Spectroscopy, and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The average size of the AgNPs was determined less than 60 nm using the TEM and Zetasizer measurement system (measured in purity water suspension). The characteristic peak of AgNPs was observed at -414 nm from UV-Vis results. Antibacterial and genotoxic activity of synthesized AgNPs (0.1, 1, and 10 ppm) were also determined by using the agar well diffusion method and in vivo Somatic Mutation and Recombination Test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster. AgNPs exhibited potential antimicrobial activity against all the tested bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) except Escherichia coli in a dose-dependent manner. AgNPs did not induce genotoxicity in the Drosophila SMART assay. 79.33, 65.47, and 41.95% inhibition of biofilms formed by P. aeruginosa were observed at 10, 1, and 0.1 ppm of AgNPs, respectively. The overall results indicate that N. clavispora MH244410.1 is a good candidate for novel applications in biomedical research.","Kahraman, T; Korcan, SE; Liman, R; Cigerci, IH; Acikbas, Y; Konuk, M; Akkus, GU",EUROBIOTECH JOURNAL,2021,10.2478/ebtj-2021-0020,0.511143091525191,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.908266273528583,0.0917337264714171,0.999992247045665,7.75295433530498e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
11992,SOLiD-SAGE of Endophyte-Infected Red Fescue Reveals Numerous Effects on Host Transcriptome and an Abundance of Highly Expressed Fungal Secreted Proteins,"One of the most important plant-fungal symbiotic relationships is that of cool season grasses with endophytic fungi of the genera Epichloe and Neotyphodium. These associations often confer benefits, such as resistance to herbivores and improved drought tolerance, to the hosts. One benefit that appears to be unique to fine fescue grasses is disease resistance. As a first step towards understanding the basis of the endophyte-mediated disease resistance in Festuca rubra we carried out a SOLiD-SAGE quantitative transcriptome comparison of endophyte-free and Epichloe festucae-infected F. rubra. Over 200 plant genes involved in a wide variety of physiological processes were statistically significantly differentially expressed between the two samples. Many of the endophyte expressed genes were surprisingly abundant, with the most abundant fungal tag representing over 10% of the fungal mapped tags. Many of the abundant fungal tags were for secreted proteins. The second most abundantly expressed fungal gene was for a secreted antifungal protein and is of particular interest regarding the endophyte-mediated disease resistance. Similar genes in Penicillium and Aspergillus spp. have been demonstrated to have antifungal activity. Of the 10 epichloae whole genome sequences available, only one isolate of E. festucae and Neotyphodium gansuense var inebrians have an antifungal protein gene. The uniqueness of this gene in E. festucae from F. rubra, its transcript abundance, and the secreted nature of the protein, all suggest it may be involved in the disease resistance conferred to the host, which is a unique feature of the fine fescue-endophyte symbiosis.","Ambrose, KV; Belanger, FC",PLOS ONE,2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0053214,0.974900312721708,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.921807436472824,0.0781925635271756,0.999967082583173,3.2917416826761e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16561,Influence of rumen fermentation on response to endophyte-infected tall fescue seed measured by a rat bioassay.,"Possible alteration of toxicity of endophyte-infected tall fescue by ruminal fermentation was studied using 28 Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (avg. initial wt., 141 g). These were assigned randomly to one of four treatments in a 2*2 factorial consisting of a 14-day growth period with weights and feed consumption data determined on days 0, 5, 10 and 14. Treatments were: endophyte-infected Kentucky-31 tall fescue seed (E+) or endophyte free Johnstone tall fescue seed (E-) that was incubated for 0 (NON) or 24 hours (INC) with rumen fluid collected from a 290-kg cannulated steer fed a diet containing 37% endophyte-infected tall fescue hay. Diets consisted of 50% lab chow, 39% fescue seed and 11% rumen contents (air-dry basis). Alkaloid content (N-acetyl plus N-formyl loline) for the four diets were 2540, 2680, 0, and 0 micrograms/g for E+NON, E+INC, E-NON, and E-INC diets, respectively. E- treatments gained faster, consumed more feed and converted feed more efficiently (P < .05) than did E+ fed groups. No difference in feed intake was observed within E+ treatments, however, the E+INC diet gained faster (P < .05) and converted feed more efficiently (P < .05) than did E+NON fed rats (2.56 vs 1.96 g/d and 5.94 vs 7.51 g of feed/g of gain for gain and feed conversion, respectively). Including endophyte-infected seed in rat diets depressed performance (ie. intake, gain and feed efficiency). This depression was partially alleviated by a 24-hour incubation with rumen fluid contents suggesting that toxicity of endophyte-infected tall fescue is lessened due to rumen microbial action.",Westendorf ML; Mitchell GE; Tucker RE,Drug and chemical toxicology,1992,10.3109/01480549209014162,0.979533611463097,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993067138642383,0.00693286135761736,0.999998728685361,1.2713146388954e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19778,Bioactive Secondary Metabolites of the Genus Diaporthe and Anamorph Phomopsis from Terrestrial and Marine Habitats and Endophytes: 2010-2019.,"The genus Diaporthe and its anamorph Phomopsis are distributed worldwide in many ecosystems. They are regarded as potential sources for producing diverse bioactive metabolites. Most species are attributed to plant pathogens, non-pathogenic endophytes, or saprobes in terrestrial host plants. They colonize in the early parasitic tissue of plants, provide a variety of nutrients in the cycle of parasitism and saprophytism, and participate in the basic metabolic process of plants. In the past ten years, many studies have been focused on the discovery of new species and biological secondary metabolites from this genus. In this review, we summarize a total of 335 bioactive secondary metabolites isolated from 26 known species and various unidentified species of Diaporthe and Phomopsis during 2010-2019. Overall, there are 106 bioactive compounds derived from Diaporthe and 246 from Phomopsis, while 17 compounds are found in both of them. They are classified into polyketides, terpenoids, steroids, macrolides, ten-membered lactones, alkaloids, flavonoids, and fatty acids. Polyketides constitute the main chemical population, accounting for 64%. Meanwhile, their bioactivities mainly involve cytotoxic, antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-algae, phytotoxic, and enzyme inhibitory activities.

12425,Fungal succession on the decomposition of three plant species from a Brazilian mangrove,"Leaf decomposition is the primary process in release of nutrients in the dynamic mangrove habitat, supporting the ecosystem food webs. On most environments, fungi are an essential part of this process. However, due to the peculiarities of mangrove forests, this group is currently neglected. Thus, this study tests the hypothesis that fungal communities display a specific succession pattern in different mangrove species and this due to differences in their ecological role. A molecular approach was employed to investigate the dynamics of the fungal community during the decomposition of three common plant species (Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa, and Avicennia schaueriana) from a mangrove habitat located at the southeast of Brazil. Plant material was the primary driver of fungi communities, but time also was marginally significant for the process, and evident changes in the fungal community during the decomposition process were observed. The five most abundant classes common to all the three plant species were Saccharomycetes, Sordariomycetes, Tremellomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, and Dothideomycetes, all belonging to the Phylum Ascomycota. Microbotryomycetes class were shared only by A. schaueriana and L. racemosa, while Agaricomycetes class were shared by L. racemosa and R. mangle. The class Glomeromycetes were shared by A. schaueriana and R. mangle. The analysis of the core microbiome showed that Saccharomycetes was the most abundant class. In the variable community, Sordariomycetes was the most abundant one, mainly in the Laguncularia racemosa plant. The results presented in this work shows a specialization of the fungal community regarding plant material during litter decomposition which might be related to the different chemical composition and rate of degradation.","Moitinho, MA; Chiaramonte, JB; Bononi, L; Gumiere, T; Melo, IS; Taketani, RG",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2022,10.1038/s41598-022-18667-x,0.838623175448515,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999987096575868,1.29034241321659e-5,0.999999997026957,2.9730433670494e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12045,Antifungal Activity of Gallic Acid In Vitro and In Vivo,"Gallic acid (GA) is a polyphenol natural compound found in many medicinal plant species, including pomegranate rind (Punica granatum L.), and has been shown to have antiinflammatory and antibacterial properties. Pomegranate rind is used to treat bacterial and fungal pathogens in Uyghur and other systems of traditional medicine, but, surprisingly, the effects of GA on antifungal activity have not yet been reported. In this study, we aimed to investigate the inhibitory effects of GA on fungal strains both in vitro and in vivo. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the NCCLS (M38-A and M27-A2) standard method in vitro, and GA was found to have a broad spectrum of antifungal activity, with MICs for all the tested dermatophyte strains between 43.75 and 83.33 mu g/mL. Gallic acid was also active against three Candida strains, with MICs between 12.5 and 100.0 mu g/mL. The most sensitive Candida species was Candida albicans (MIC = 12.5 mu g/mL), and the most sensitive filamentous species was Trichophyton rubrum (MIC = 43.75 mu g/mL), which was comparable in potency to the control, fluconazole. The mechanism of action was investigated for inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis using an HPLC-based assay and an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Gallic acid reduced the activity of sterol 14 alpha-demethylase P450 (CYP51) and squalene epoxidase in the T. rubrum membrane, respectively. In vivo model demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection administration of GA (80 mg/kg d) significantly enhanced the cure rate in a mice infection model of systemic fungal infection. Overall, our results confirm the antifungal effects of GA and suggest a mechanism of action, suggesting that GA has the potential to be developed further as a natural antifungal agent for clinical use.

12242,"Characterization of the Mycobiome of the Seagrass, Zostera marina, Reveals Putative Associations With Marine Chytrids","Seagrasses are globally distributed marine flowering plants that are foundation species in coastal ecosystems. Seagrass beds play essential roles as habitats and hatcheries, in nutrient cycling, and in protecting the coastline from erosion. Although many studies have focused on seagrass ecology, only a limited number have investigated their associated fungi. In terrestrial systems, fungi can have beneficial and detrimental effects on plant fitness. However, not much is known about marine fungi and even less is known about seagrass associated fungi. Here we used culture-independent sequencing of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region to characterize the taxonomic diversity of fungi associated with the seagrass, Zostera marina. We sampled from two Z. marina beds in Bodega Bay over three time points to investigate fungal diversity within and between plants. Our results indicate that there are many fungal taxa for which a taxonomic assignment cannot be made living on and inside Z. marina leaves, roots and rhizomes and that these plant tissues harbor distinct fungal communities. We also identified differences in the abundances of the orders, Glomerellales, Agaricales and Malasseziales, between seagrass tissues. The most prevalent ITS amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) associated with Z. marina tissues could not initially be confidently assigned to a fungal phylum, but shared significant sequence similarity with Chytridiomycota and Aphelidomycota. To obtain a more definitive taxonomic classification of the most abundant ASV associated with Z. marina leaves, we used PCR with one primer targeting a unique region of this ASV's ITS2 and a second primer targeting fungal 28S rRNA genes to amplify part of the 28S rRNA gene region corresponding to this ASV. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the resulting partial 28S rRNA gene revealed that the organism that this ASV comes from is a member of Novel Clade SW-I in the order Lobulomycetales in the phylum Chytridiomycota. This clade includes known parasites of freshwater diatoms and algae and it is possible this chytrid is directly infecting Z. marina leaf tissues. This work highlights a need for further studies focusing on marine fungi and the potential importance of these understudied communities to the larger seagrass ecosystem.","Ettinger, CL; Eisen, JA",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2019,10.3389/fmicb.2019.02476,0.986479961597937,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.9951795223186,0.00482047768140007,0.999999999983,1.6999734953060397e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

R. glutinosa is an important Chinese medicinal material. Its yield and quality are susceptible to various stresses. The HD-Zip transcription factors is unique to the plant, and roles in modulation of plant growth and response to environmental stresses. However, there is no relevant research on the HD-ZIP of R. glutinosa. In this study, 92 HD-Zip transcription factors were identified in R. glutinosa, and denominated as RgHDZ1-RgHDZ92. Members of RgHDZ were classified into four groups (HD-ZipI-IV) based on the phylogenetic relationship of Arabidopsis HD-Zip proteins, and each group contains 38, 18, 17, and 19 members, respectively. Expression analyses of RgHDZ genes based on transcriptome data showed that the expression of these genes could be induced by the endophytic fungus of R. glutinosa. Additionally, we showed that RgHDZ genes were differentially expressed in response to drought, waterlogging, temperature, and salinity treatments. This study provides important information for different expression patterns of stress-responsive HD-Zip and may contribute to the better understanding of the different responses of plants to biotic and abiotic stresses, and provide a molecular basis for the cultivation of resistant varieties of R. glutinosa.","Zhu, YH; Peng, SP; Zhao, L; Feng, WS; Dong, CM",PLANT SIGNALING & BEHAVIOR,2022,10.1080/15592324.2022.2096787,0.929785747304046,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993728019963528,0.00627198003647198,0.99999999938778406,6.12216499717988e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15207,RNA Interference in Plant Protection from Fungal and Oomycete Infection,"Abstract: Phytopathogenic fungi pose a threat to food security, limiting the biological potential of agricultural crops and reducing the quality of products. New plant protection methods based on natural systemic and cellular phytoimmunity are being developed, where a unique mechanism, described by the term “RNA interference” (RNAi), occupies a special place. RNAi regulates the expression of target genes in a homologically dependent manner; with the involvement of a protein complex designated as RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex), on the one hand, it protects plants from pathogens, but on the other hand, pathogens use it as a virulence factor. Cases of bilateral exchange of small RNAs between plants and pathogens that affect them through extracellular vesicles have been described. This review discusses the role of small RNAs, as well as the DCL, AGO, and RdR proteins, in the infection of plants with pathogenic fungi and oomycetes, and the prospects for using RNAi in the development of environmentally friendly modern plant protection products. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.",Maksimov I.V.; Shein M.Y.; Burkhanova G.F.,Applied Biochemistry and Microbiology,2022,10.1134/S0003683822100106,0.973739663238885,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995156110854095,0.0048438891459053,0.999999997405588,2.59441224059742e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

This study aimed to assess fungal contamination in two plants handling solid waste management. Air samples from the two plants were collected through an impaction method. Surface samples were also collected by swabbing surfaces of the same indoor sites. All collected samples were incubated at 27 degrees C for 5 to 7 d. After lab processing and incubation of collected samples, quantitative and qualitative results were obtained with identification of the isolated fungal species. Air samples were also subjected to molecular methods by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) using an impinger method to measure DNA of Aspergillus flavus complex and Stachybotrys chartarum. Assessment of particulate matter (PM) was also conducted with portable direct-reading equipment. Particles concentration measurement was performed at five different sizes (PM0.5; PM1; PM2.5; PM5; PM10). With respect to the waste sorting plant, three species more frequently isolated in air and surfaces were A. niger (73.9%; 66.1%), A. fumigatus (16%; 13.8%), and A. flavus (8.7%; 14.2%). In the incineration plant, the most prevalent species detected in air samples were Penicillium sp.

19662,Isolation and Identification of Isocoumarin Derivatives With Specific Inhibitory Activity Against Wnt Pathway and Metabolome Characterization of Lasiodiplodia venezuelensis.,"The Wnt signaling pathway controls multiple events during embryonic development of multicellular animals and is carcinogenic when aberrantly activated in adults. Breast cancers are dependent on Wnt pathway overactivation mostly through dysregulation of pathway component protein expression, which necessitates the search for therapeutically relevant compounds targeting them. Highly diverse microorganisms as endophytes represent an underexplored field in the therapeutic natural products research. In the present work, the objective was to explore the chemical diversity and presence of selective Wnt inhibitors within a unique collection of fungi isolated as foliar endophytes from the long-lived tropical palm Astrocaryum sciophilum. The fungi were cultured, extracted with ethyl acetate, and screened for their effects on the Wnt pathway and cell proliferation. The endophytic strain Lasiodiplodia venezuelensis was prioritized for scaled-up fractionation based on its selective activity. Application of geometric transfer from analytical HPLC conditions to semi-preparative scale and use of dry load sample introduction enabled the isolation of 15 pure compounds in a single step. Among the molecules identified, five are original natural products described for the first time, and six are new to this species. An active fraction obtained by semi-preparative HPLC was re-purified by UHPLC-PDA using a 1.7 µm phenyl column. 75 injections of 8 µg were necessary to obtain sufficient amounts of each compound for structure elucidation and bioassays. Using this original approach, in addition to the two major compounds, a third minor compound identified as (R)-(-)-5-hydroxymellein (18) was obtained, which was found to be responsible for the significant Wnt inhibition activity recorded. Further studies of this compound and its structural analogs showed that only 18 acts in a highly specific manner, with no acute cytotoxicity.

Nine genes were identified in a 25-kb region of LOL-1 and designated (in order) lolF-1, lolC-1, lolD-1, lolO-1, loIA-1, lolU-1, lolP-1, lofT-1, and lolE-1. LOL-2 contained the homologs lolC-2 through lolE-2 in the same order and orientation. Also identified was lolF-2, but its possible linkage with either cluster was undetermined. Most lol genes were regulated in N. uncinatum and N. coenophialum, and all were expressed concomitantly with loline-alkaloid biosynthesis. A lolC-2 RNA-interference (RNAi) construct was introduced into N. uncinatum., and in two independent transformants, RNAi significantly decreased lolC expression (P < 0.01) and loline-alkaloid accumulation in culture (P < 0.001) compared to vector-only controls, indicating involvement of lolC in biosynthesis of lolines. The predicted LolU protein has a DNA-binding site signature, and the relationships of other lol-gene products indicate that the pathway has evolved front various different primary and secondary biosynthesis pathways.","Spiering, MJ; Moon, CD; Wilkinson, HH; Schardl, CL",GENETICS,2005,10.1534/genetics.104.035972,0.951604812630429,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994388275597359,0.00561172440264096,0.99994540179583,5.45982041696425e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1126,Unexpected diversity of basidiomycetous endophytes in sapwood and leaves of Hevea,"Research on fungal endophytes has expanded dramatically in recent years, but little is known about the diversity and ecological roles of endophytic basidiomycetes. Here we report the analysis of 310 basidiomycetous endophytes isolated from wild and planted populations of the rubber tree genus, Hevea. Species accumulation curves were nonasymptotic, as in the majority of endophyte surveys, indicating that more sampling is needed to recover the true diversity of the community. One hundred eighteen OTUs were delimited, representing nine orders of Basidiomycota (Agaricales, Athehales, Auriculariales, Cantharellales, Hymenochaetales, Polyporales, Russulales, Septobasidiales, Tremellales). The diversity of basidiomycetous endophytes found inhabiting wild populations of Hevea was comparable to that present in plantations. However, when samples were segregated by tissue type, sapwood of wild populations was found to contain a higher number of species than sapwood of planted trees. Seventy-five percent of isolates were members of the Polyporales, the majority in the phlebioid clade. Most of the species belong to clades known to cause a white-rot type of wood decay. Two species in the insect-associated genus Septobasidium were isolated. The most frequently isolated genera included Bjerkandera, Ceriporia, Phanerochaete, Phlebia, Rigidoporus, Tinctoporellus, Trametes (Polyporales), Peniophora, Stereum (Russulales) and Coprinellus (Agaricales), all of which have been reported as endophytes from a variety of hosts, across wide geographic locations. Literature records on the geographic distribution and host association of these genera revealed that their distribution and substrate affinity could be extended if the endophytic niche was investigated as part of fungal biodiversity surveys.","Martin, R; Gazis, R; Skaltsas, D; Chaverri, P; Hibbett, D",MYCOLOGIA,2015,10.3852/14-206,0.98116414698603,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985904292124703,0.0140957078752971,0.9999999741009,2.58991003088127e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3567,Potential of Phylloplane Fungi from Mangrove Plant (Rhizophora apiculata Blume) as Biological Control Agents against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense in Banana Plant (Musa acuminata L.),"Phylloplane fungi is a non-pathogenic fungi on the leaf surface that can be used to control plant diseases caused by pathogens. One of the most damaging banana plant diseases is fusarium wilt, caused by the pathogenic fungi Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Cubense (Foc). Mangrove plant Rhizophora apiculate is widely distributed and is a high-diversity area where microorganisms that produce anti-microbial compounds flourish. This plant can be used as a biological agent. This study aims to determine the various phylloplane fungi available from mangrove plant R. apiculata leaves and their potential use against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) in banana plants (Musa acuminata L.). All 20 phylloplane fungi were identified through DNA sequencing with identities of 83.88-100%; of those 20, 3 were found that have antagonistic potential against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc): Lasiodiplodia theobromae (67.43%), Trichoderma harzianum (66.65), and Nigrospora sphaerica (65.33%). In the in vivo tests, the best inhibition of disease incidence was shown by treatment with Lasiodiplodia theobromae (11.11%). The present study confirmed that phylloplane fungi isolated from R. apiculata can inhibit fusarium wilt disease in banana plant.","Shara, M; Basyuni, M; Hasanuddin",FORESTS,2023,10.3390/f14020167,0.972204106626756,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994257328012933,0.00574267198706659,0.999999999968269,3.17306181329968e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

15666,Identification and Characterisation of Seed-Borne Fungal Pathogens Associated with Maize (Zea mays L.),"A research study was conducted to identify and characterise seed-borne fungal pathogens associated with maize (Zea mays L.) in storage. Seed-borne fungal pathogenic infections of maize were studied using seed samples collected from Gokwe South District in Zimbabwe. The agar plating method using PDA medium was used to detect fungal pathogens on the maize seeds. A total of 150 treatments were used for this experiment, which were replicated three times in a randomised complete block design (RCBD). Analysis of the grain showed the presence of Fusarium moniliforme, Rhizopus stolonifer, Penicillium citrinum, and mostly Aspergillus species, namely, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus parasiticus, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus tamarii. Significant differences (p < 0.05) between treatments were detected for the pathogens. A total of ten samples were used for mycotoxin determination, and all of them were 100% positive with aflatoxin total, zearalenone, fumonisin, and deoxynivalenol (DON) having an average of 0.255 ppb, 2.425 ppb, 2.65 ppb, and 0.07 ppb, respectively. The present study showed that most grain samples are contaminated with different species of fungi with mycotoxigenic potential. The data on the diversity and magnitude of pathogen infection by fungal species will have a significant effect even at the regional level for predicting the extent of pre-and postinfections. Measures to reduce mycotoxin contamination are needed for maize grains. © 2021 M. L.

13210,The inhibitory effect of the various seed coating substances against rice seed borne fungi and their shelf-life during storage,"Presently, chemical seed treatments are in discussion due to their directly or indirectly impacts on human health or other living organisms. They may also negatively affect the ecosystem and the food chain. In rice seeds, chemicals may cause phytotoxic effects including seed degradation. Eugenol is the main component of clove (Eugenia caryophillis) oil, which was proved to act simultaneously as bactericide, virocide and especially fungicide. The in vitro study was aimed to compare the inhibitory effect of the following seed treatment substances against seed borne fungi and their shelf-life during 12 months of storage; conventional captan (CA), chitosan-lignosulphonate polymer (CL), eugenol incorporated into chitosan-lignosulphonate polymer (E+CL) and control (CO). The obtained results of fungi inhibition were classified in three groups, which showed at first that CA treatment led to a better, i.e., longer, inhibitory effect on Alternaria padwickii, Rhizoctonia solani, Curvularia sp., Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger than E+CL. Secondly, E+CL coating polymer showed the longest inhibitory effect against Bipolaris oryzae and Nigrospora oryzae compared to CA and CL coating polymer. Finally, both CA and E+CL coating polymer had non-significant difference inhibitory effect on Fusarium moniliforme. The variant of CL coating polymer for seed coating was only during the first 6 months of storage able to inhibit all species of the observed seed borne fungi, whereas CA and E+CL coating polymer were capable to inhibit most of the fungi until 9 months of storage. © 2009 Asian Network for Scientific Information.",Thobunluepop P.,Pakistan Journal of Biological Sciences,2009,10.3923/pjbs.2009.1102.1110,0.982389582338785,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999155356030722,8.4464396927784e-4,0.999999984498691,1.55013092362211e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
4301,Evolutionary history of ergot with a new infrageneric classification (Hypocreales: Clavicipitaceae: Claviceps),"The ergot, genus Claviceps, comprises approximately 60 species of specialised ovarial grass parasites famous for the production of food toxins and pharmaceutics. Although the ergot has been known for centuries, its evolution have not been resolved yet. Our approach combining multilocus phylogeny, molecular dating and the study of ecological, morphological and metabolic features shows that Claviceps originated in South America in the Palaeocene on a common ancestor of BEP (subfamilies Bambusoideae, Ehrhartoideae, Pooideae) and PACMAD (subfamilies Panicoideae, Aristidoideae, Chloridoideae, Micrairoideae, Arundinoideae, Danthonioideae) grasses. Four clades described here as sections diverged during the Paleocene and Eocene. Since Claviceps are parasitic fungi with a close relationship with their host plants, their evolution is influenced by interactions with the new hosts, either by the spread to a new continent or the radiation of the host plants. Three of the sections possess very narrow host ranges and biogeographical distributions and have relatively low toxicity. On the contrary, the section Claviceps, comprising the rye ergot, C. purpurea, is unique in all aspects. Fungi in this section of North American origin have spread all over the world and infect grasses in all subfamilies as well as sedges, and it is the only section synthesising toxic ergopeptines and secalonic acids. The evolutionary success of the Claviceps section members can be explained by high toxin presence, serving as feeding deterrents and playing a role in their protective mutualism with host plants. Closely related taxa Neoclaviceps monostipa and Cepsiclava phalaridis were combined into the genus Aciculosporium.","Píchová, K; Pazoutová, S; Kostovcík, M; Chudícková, M; Stodulková, E; Novák, P; Flieger, M; van der Linde, E; Kolarík, M",MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION,2018,10.1016/j.ympev.2018.02.013,0.981207260839884,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999937153910683,6.28460893172636e-5,1,0,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

2000,Host-Specific and Environment-Dependent Effects of Endophyte Alternaria oxytropis on Three Locoweed Oxytropis Species in China,"Plant-endophyte symbioses are widespread in grasslands. While symbiotic interactions often provide hosts with major fitness enhancements, the role of the endophyte Alternaria oxytropis, which produces swainsonine in locoweeds (Oxytropis and Astragalus spp.), remains enigmatic. We compared endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) plants of three main Chinese locoweed species (O. kansuensis, O. glabra, and O. ochrocephala) under controlled conditions, and analyzed environmental factors at locoweed poisoning hotspots for herbivores. The results demonstrated significant species-specific effects: E+ plants of O. glabra and O. ochrocephala exhibited 26-39% reductions in biomass, net photosynthetic rate, and stomatal conductance, with elevated CO2 levels, while O. kansuensis showed no measurable impacts. Swainsonine concentrations were 16-20 times higher in E+ plants (122.6-151.7 mg/kg) than in E- plants. Geospatial analysis revealed that poisoning hotspots for herbivores consistently occurred in regions with extreme winter conditions (minimum temperatures <= -17 degrees C and precipitation <= 1 mm during the driest month), suggesting context-dependent benefits under abiotic stress. These findings suggest that the ecological role of A. oxytropis may vary depending on both host species and environmental context, highlighting a trade-off between growth costs and potential stress tolerance conferred by A. oxytropis. The study underscores the need for field validation to elucidate the adaptive mechanisms maintaining this symbiosis in harsh environments.","Zhang, YY; Li, YZ; Shi, ZJ",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2025,10.3390/jof11070516,0.991593592334253,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992239184114743,0.00776081588525716,0.999999995953526,4.046473822683081e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Recognition of the deleterious effects of the endophytic fungus Acremonium coenophialum has resulted in substantial acceptance of new endophyte-free cultivars. Destruction of old pastures and the concomitant loss of potentially valuable adapted germplasm could be a valid cause for concern. The objectives of this study were to evaluate genetic variation for maturity and plant morphological traits, both among and within tall fescue cv. 'Kentucky 31' populations from 18 to 38 year-old pastures in Alabama. Ten populations of approximately 50 plants each were collected from old Alabama tall fescue pastures. Two pastures were sampled in each of five counties, representing the five major land use areas of the state. In 1990, spaced plants of all populations were evaluated at heading time for maturity, morphological, and disease traits at two locations in central Alabama. Endophyte infection level of the populations ranged from 2 to 100 %. Maturity was highly correlated with tiller length and flag leaf width and was used as a covariate for these traits in the analysis of variance. Leaf rust and net blotch ratings were negatively correlated. Significant variation among populations was observed for maturity and flag leaf dimensions, most variation being due to differences among source counties. Significant variation was observed within all populations for maturity and morphological traits, but only in seven populations for leaf rust. No within-population variation was detected for net blotch. The average precipitation for the month of May explained 81 % of the variation among populations for maturity. Age of the pasture sampled had a significant effect on tiller diameter (r2 = 0.55), and latitude of the pasture sampled was the best individual predictor of leaf width (r2 = 0.42).

4124,Volatile Compounds of Endophytic Bacillus spp. have Biocontrol Activity Against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum,"To develop an effective biological agent to control Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, three endophytic Bacillus spp. strains with high antagonistic activity were isolated from maize seed and characterized. In vitro assays revealed that the Bacillus endophytes could produce volatile organic compounds (VOC) that reduced sclerotial production and inhibited mycelial growth of S. sclerotiorum. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that the selected strains produced 16 detectable VOC. Eight of the produced VOC exhibited negative effects on S. sclerotiorum, while a further four induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species in mycelial cells. A mixture of VOC produced by Bacillus velezensis VM11 caused morphological changes in the ultrastructure and organelle membranes of S. sclerotiorum mycelial cells. The bromophenol blue assay revealed a yellow color of untreated fungal mycelium, which grew faster and deeper from 24 to 72 h postinoculation, as an indication of reduced pH. The potassium permanganate (KMnO4) titration assay showed that the rate of oxalic acid accumulation was higher in minimal salt liquid medium cultures inoculated with untreated fungal plugs compared with the Bacillus VOC-treated ones. Interestingly, biological control assays using host-plant leaves challenged with treated fungal mycelial plugs produced reduced lesions compared with the control.

Cupressaceae plant family hosts a variety of bioactive ascomycetous endophytes. In this study, antifungal activity of a number of such endophytes were investigated against human pathogenic fungi Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus niger. To this end, 16 superior bioactive endophytic fungi from Cupressaceae were used, including Alternaria alternata, Alternaria pellucida, Ascorhizoctonia sp., Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Aurobasidium sp., Cladosporium porophorum, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillium viridicatum, Phoma herbarum, Phoma sp., Pyrenochaeta sp., Trichoderma atroviride, Trichoderma atroviride and Trichoderma koningii. In vitro bioassays indicated anti-Asperilli activity of the endophytic fungi in dual cultures. Most notably, Trichoderma koningii CSE32 and Trichoderma atroviride JCE(33) showed complete growth inhibition of both A. niger and A. fumigatus, within 3 to 7 days. Also, volatile compouds (VOCs) of T. koningii CSE32 and T. atroviride JCE(33) exhibited 33-100% growth inhibition of A. niger, whithin 3 days. Moreover, on the day 7, growth of A. niger was less affected than that of A. fumigatus. In general, it appears that there is a direct relationship between the exposure time and the inhibitory activity of endophytes VOCs on the growth of target Aspergillus species. Furthremore, the extracellular secondary metabolites (SMs) of four selected fungal endophytes exhibited anti-Aspergillus activity at all treatment levels as shown by Agar-diffusion assay. SMs from T. koningii CSE32 and Pyrenochaeta CSE134 showed strongest activities against A. niger, and SMs from T. koningii CSE32 and F. oxysporum CAE(14) showed strongest activities against A. fumigatus. In conclusion, given the globally recognized issue of antibiotic resistance and the urge to discover new antimicrobial substances, our findings provide new insights into the potential use of Cupressaceae's endophytic fungi in antifungal-based drug discovery programs.

15448,"An updated account of Fagales-inhabiting Italian Ascomycota and mycogeography, with additions to Pezizomycotina","Studies of plant-associated Ascomycota are topical, as they have varied life modes depending on their hosts in different ecosystems. In Italy, Fagales are economically and ecologically important plants, especially in the Alps and Apennine mountain ranges. Fagales species host numerous ascomycetous species, comprising endophytes, saprobes, or pathogens. We retrieved data from 308 publications from 1873 to 2021 and listed 776 Ascomycota on Fagales in Italy. Among these, 696 were identified at the species level and 80 at the genus level. Documented taxa belong to Pezizomycotina (746), Saccharomycotina (2), Taphrinomycotina (5), and Ascomycota genera incertae sedis (23). Sordariomycetes are dominant (34%), followed by Dothideomycetes (24%), Lecanoromycetes (16%), and Leotiomycetes (11%). Distribution maps were provided for the occurrence of Fagales trees and Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Leotiomycetes, Pezizomycetes, and Sordariomycetes taxa. Lichenized taxa were excluded from the mapping. We provided additions to Valsariaceae (Valsaria rudis) in Dothideomycetes, Coryneaceae (Coryneum modonium), Melanconiellaceae (Melanconiella flavovirens and M. meridionalis), and Woswasiaceae (Woswasia atropurpurea) in Sordariomycetes. These taxa represent a novel host record, a provincial record, and four regional records in Italy. Species boundaries were defined using polyphasic approaches. In addition, taxonomic notes were provided for each reported class, including incertae sedis genera. The study provides information on the taxonomy, hosts, and distribution of Ascomycota in Italy to encourage further research related to important plant species. © 2022, MRF.

10860,"Dark septate endophytic fungi increase the activity of proton pumps, efficiency of <SUP>15</SUP>N recovery from ammonium sulphate, N content, and micronutrient levels in rice plants","Plants colonised by dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungi show increased uptake of nutrients available in the environment. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the impact of DSE fungi on the activity of proton pumps, nitrogen (N) recovery from ammonium sulphate, and nutrient accumulation in rice plants. Treatments consisted of non-inoculated plants and plants inoculated with two isolates of DSE fungi, A101 and A103. To determine N recovery from the soil, ammonium sulphate enriched with N-15 was added to a non-sterile substrate while parameters associated with the activity of proton pumps and with NO3- uptake were determined in a sterile environment. The A101 and A103 fungal isolates colonised the roots of rice plants, promoting N-15 uptake, growth, and accumulation of nutrients as compared with the mock control. A103 induced the expression of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase (PM H+-ATPase) isoforms OsA5 and OsA8, the activity of the PM H+-ATPase and H+-pyrophosphatase. Our results suggest that the inoculation of rice plants with DSE fungi represents a strategy to improve the N recovery from ammonium sulphate and rice plant growth through the induction of OsA5 and OsA8 isoforms and stimulation of the PM H+-ATPase and H+-pyrophosphatase.","Vergara, C; Araujo, KEC; Sperandio, MVL; Santos, LA; Urquiaga, S; Zilli, JÉ",BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY,2019,10.1007/s42770-019-00092-4,0.952709712879111,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.986128731581755,0.013871268418245,0.999976109131844,2.38908681559069e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19340,Effect of seed biopriming with selected endophytes on the growth and chilling tolerance of rice plants.,"The aim of this study was to develop an efficient bioinoculant for amelioration of adverse effects from chilling stress (10°C), which are frequently occurred during rice seedling stage. Seed germination bioassay under chilling condition with rice (Oryza sativa L.) cv. Tainan 11 was performed to screen for plant growth-promoting (PGP) bacteria among 41 chilling-tolerant rice endophytes. And several agronomic traits were used to evaluate the effects of bacterial inoculation on rice seedling, which were experienced for 7-d chilling stress in walk-in growth chamber. The field trials were further used to verify the performance of potential PGP endophytes on rice growth. A total of three endophytes with multiple PGP traits were obtained. It was demonstrated that Pseudomonas sp. CC-LS37 inoculation led to 18% increase of maximal efficiency of Photosystem II (PSII) after 7-d chilling stress and 7% increase of chlorophyll a content, and 64% decline of malondialdehyde content in shoot after 10-d recovery at normal temperature in walk-in growth chamber. In field trial, biopriming of seeds with strain CC-LS37 caused rice plants to increase shoot chlorophyll soil plant analysis development values (by 2.9% and 2.5%, respectively) and tiller number (both by 61%) under natural climate and chilling stress during the end of tillering stage, afterward 30% more grain yield was achieved. In conclusion, strain CC-LS37 exerted its function in increase of tiller number of chilling stress-treated rice seedlings via improvement of photosynthetic characteristics, which in turn increases the rice grain yield. This study also proposed multiple indices used in the screening of potential endophytes for conferring chilling tolerance of rice plants.",Lai WA; Shen FT; Ho TD; Yu SM; Young CC,Letters in applied microbiology,2023,10.1093/lambio/ovac035,0.94548519608735,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.847886479225957,0.152113520774043,0.999423046953031,5.7695304696947e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
19541,Temporally Selective Modification of the Tomato Rhizosphere and Root Microbiome by Volcanic Ash Fertilizer Containing Micronutrients.,"Food crops are grown with fertilizers containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (macronutrients) along with magnesium, calcium, boron, and zinc (micronutrients) at different ratios during their cultivation. Soil and plant-associated microbes have been implicated to promote plant growth, stress tolerance, and productivity. However, the high degree of variability across agricultural environments makes it difficult to assess the possible influences of nutrient fertilizers on these microbial communities. Uncovering the underlying mechanisms could lead us to achieve consistently improved food quality and productivity with minimal environmental impacts. For this purpose, we tested a commercially available fertilizer (surface-mined volcanic ash deposit Azomite) applied as a supplement to the normal fertilizer program of greenhouse-grown tomato plants. Because this treatment showed a significant increase in fruit production at measured intervals, we examined its impact on the composition of below-ground microbial communities, focusing on members identified as ""core taxa"" that were enriched in the rhizosphere and root endosphere compared to bulk soil and appeared above their predicted neutral distribution levels in control and treated samples. This analysis revealed that Azomite had little effect on microbial composition overall, but it had a significant, temporally selective influence on the core taxa. Changes in the composition of the core taxa were correlated with computationally inferred changes in functional pathway enrichment associated with carbohydrate metabolism, suggesting a shift in available microbial nutrients within the roots. This finding exemplifies how the nutrient environment can specifically alter the functional capacity of root-associated bacterial taxa, with the potential to improve crop productivity. IMPORTANCE Various types of soil fertilizers are used routinely to increase crop yields globally. The effects of these treatments are assessed mainly by the benefits they provide in increased crop productivity. There exists a gap in our understanding of how soil fertilizers act on the plant-associated microbial communities. The underlying mechanisms of nutrient uptake are widely complex and, thus, difficult to evaluate fully but have critical influences on both soil and plant health. Here, we presented a systematic approach to analyzing the effects of fertilizer on core microbial communities in soil and plants, leading to predictable outcomes that can be empirically tested and used to develop simple and affordable field tests. The methods described here can be used for any fertilizer and crop system. Continued effort in advancing our understanding of how fertilizers affect plant and microbe relations is needed to advance scientific understanding and help growers make better-informed decisions.",Mehlferber EC; McCue KF; Ferrel JE; Koskella B; Khanna R,Applied and environmental microbiology,2022,10.1128/aem.00049-22,0.979797643446956,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.951043832832625,0.0489561671673753,0.999986340470653,1.36595293472874e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19224,Bioactive Naphtho-α-Pyranones from Two Endophytic Fungi of the Genus Polyphilus.,"In the course of our survey to study the metabolic potential of two species of a new helotialean genus Polyphilus, namely P. frankenii and P. sieberi, their crude extracts were obtained using different cultivation techniques, which led to the isolation and characterization of two new naphtho-α-pyranone derivatives recognized as a monomer (1) and its 6,6'-homodimer (2) together with two known diketopiperazine congeners, outovirin B (3) and (3S,6S)-3,6-dibenzylpiperazine-2,5-dione (4). The structures of isolated compounds were determined based on extensive 1D and 2D NMR and HRESIMS. The absolute configuration of new naphtho-α-pyranones was determined using a comparison of their experimental ECD spectra with those of related structural analogues. 6,6'-binaphtho-α-pyranone talaroderxine C (2) exhibited potent cytotoxic activity against different mammalian cell lines with IC50 values in the low micromolar to nanomolar range. In addition, talaroderxine C unveiled stronger antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis rather than Staphylococcus aureus with MIC values of 0.52 µg mL-1 (0.83 µM) compared to 66.6 µg mL-1 (105.70 µM), respectively.",Wennrich JP; Sepanian E; Ebada SS; Llanos-Lopez NA; Ashrafi S; Maier W; Kurtán T; Stadler M,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2023,10.3390/antibiotics12081273,0.859025999281327,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.579410253819062,0.420589746180938,0.999998729314418,1.27068558186672e-6,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
18031,Identification and characterization of plant growth-promoting endophyte RE02 from Trifolium repens L. in mining smelter.,"Endophyte-assisted phytoremediation is considered to be an effective approach for bioremediation of heavy metal-contaminated soil; however, few information is available on Trifolium repens L. and its endophytes to remediate heavy metal-polluted soils. In this study, heavy metal-resistant endophytes were isolated from T. repens growing in mining smelter and identified by BIOLOG system. The isolate was also evaluated for promoting plant growth in heavy metal-contaminated soils in pot experiments. A total of eight Cd2+-resistant endophytes were isolated and these isolates preferred to grow on L-aspartic acid and α-D-glucose. All the isolates had at least two plant growth-promoting properties including siderophore production, phosphate solubilization activity, indole acetic acid (IAA) production, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase activity. Strain RE02, identified as Pseudomonas putida by Biolog system, showed the highest Cd tolerance and could reduce Cd concentration from 20 to 1.84 mg L-1 in about 49 h in liquid medium, amounting to about 90.8%. Among the five endophytes which have positive effect on the growth of T. repens, RE02, whose IAA production ability was 7.06 mg L-1 and phosphate solubilization was 134.76 mg L-1, could improve T. repens root and shoot biomass by 25.9% and 37.7% in cadmium-contained soil, respectively.

20088,An Environmental Study on Bacterial Diversity in Spoilage Lotus Seeds and Identification of its Predominant Spoilage Bacteria,"Endophytes may benefit hosts through diverse mechanisms, such as molecules that increase their capacity to compete for space, nutrients and/or ecological niches, the synthesis of antimicrobial substances or the synthesis of inducers of plant growth, or compounds like phytohormones and peptides that might keep vegetables or plant organs healthy, which additionally might have no negative environmental effects on consumers. Vacuum-packaged fresh lotus seeds are easily to get bulged due to the growth of spoilage microbial in the process of transportation and circulation. The flora analysis is conducted on the vacuum-packaged lotus seeds that get spoiled and bulged in this paper. The traditional method is used for the separation and identification of spoilage bacterial strains. Meanwhile, the reverse inference test is also used to find out the dominant microorganisms that cause the spoilage. Results showed that Leuconostoc, galactococcus, Citrobacter, Klebsiella peneumoniae and Enterobacter are the key bacterial strains which cause the spoilage and bag-bulging of vacuum-packaged lotus seeds. In addition, seven strains bacteria including three strains of lactic acid bacteria, two strains of bacteria and two strains of fungus were firstly separated from the spoilage lotus seeds by using the traditional method. Next, the reverse inference test is used to verify that these three isolated lactic acid bacteria strains cause the spoilage of lotus seeds. Moreover, three bacterial strains including Sidou Weissella confusa, Weissella confusa and lactococcus lactis were identified by the 16S rDNA technology.","Huang, ZW; Ge, SH; Lin, SL; Chen, N; Liu, WC; Qin, S; Wu, WG; Zheng, BD; Zeng, SX; Huang, XJ",EKOLOJI,2018,NA,0.93072095891366,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.920567161244092,0.0794328387559077,0.999999981021025,1.8978975169226e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15111,Diversity and antioxidant activity of endophytic fungi isolated from salam (Syzygium polyanthum),"Widjajanti H, Elfita, Sari MT, Hidayati N, Hariani PL, Setiawan A. 2023. Diversity and antioxidant activity of endophytic fungi isolated from salam (Syzygium polyanthum). Biodiversitas 24: 3051-3062. Salam (Syzygium polyanthum (Wight) Walp.) is a medicinal plant from the family Myrtaceae. The leaves are used as a spice and treat diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, ulcers, diarrhea, gastritis, and skin. This study aimed to determine endophytic fungi's diversity and antioxidant activity in the S. polyanthum plant. In addition, the distribution of endophytic fungi found on S. polyanthum was compared to that of previously reported endophytic fungi on other species of Syzygium. The distribution pattern of these endophytic fungi is needed to determine the presence of potential endophytic fungi that can live in host plants of the same genus. The endophytic fungi were isolated from fresh root bark, stem bark, and leaf tissues of S. polyanthum. The endophytic fungi were identified morphologically to determine their level of diversity; their extract was then tested for their antioxidant activity using the DPPH method. The extract that showed the highest antioxidant activity was identified molecularly. A total of 18 endophytic fungi were obtained from S. polyanthum, including seven isolates from root bark (HSA1–HSA7), four isolates from stem bark (HSB1–HSB4), and seven isolates from leaves (HSD1–HSD7). The morphological identification showed seven genera scattered in all investigated parts: Trichoderma, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Pythium, Papulaspora, Pythiogeton, and Clonostachys. The HSD5 isolate showed the best antioxidant activity, and the molecular identification confirmed this isolate as Clonostachys rosea. The comparison of the distribution of endophytic fungi isolated from S. polyanthum to endophytic fungi isolated from the host genus Syzygium showed that endophytic fungi of three genera, namely Clonostachys, Papulaspora, and Pythiogeton, are specifically found on S. polyanthum. In addition, those of four other genera, namely Trichoderma, Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Pythium, are found on other species of Syzygium. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

The objective of this study was to verify the occurrence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in weeds infesting Brazilian crops and to evaluate the inorganic phosphate solubilization potential of the associated microbiota. A total of 36 weed species were evaluated for the occurrence of mycorrhizae; of these, 11 were selected to evaluate their potential for total and relative phosphate solubilization. All of the species demonstrated mycorrhizal colonization, including a member of the Brassicaceae family, which is usually assumed to be non-mycorrhizal. In most of the species, morphological types of arbuscular and coiled hyphae were observed, with the coiled hyphae being the most common in the grasses. Dark septate endophytic fungi were observed in most of the plants. The weeds presented different potentials for P solubilization in the rhizosphere; Amaranthus retroflexus, Bidens pilosa and Leonotis nepetaefolia showed high values of relative phosphate solubilization.

2782,The bioprotective effect of root endophytic Serendipita herbamans against Fusarium wilt in tomato and its impact on root traits are determined by temperature,"Environmental conditions such as temperature can be important determinants for the success of biocontrol agents in field situations. On the one hand temperature affects biocontrol strains on the other plant-pathogen dynamics. In order to understand these dynamics, driving factors behind these interactions need to be fully characterized. Here, we i) investigated the effect of two temperature treatments on the biocontrol activity of the root endophyte Serendipita herbamans against the soil-borne pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol) in tomato and ii) assessed the impact of this biocontrol system on root morphological traits. The results of this study indicate that inoculation with S. herbamans stimulated shoot length and enhanced the shoot and root dry mass in tomato plants across both temperatures. Furthermore, S. herbamans inoculation decreased disease incidence from 67% in the Fol only treatment to 22% at lower temperatures (24 degrees C). At 28 degrees C, disease incidence was around 41% and no reduction could be seen; however, root morphological traits such as root length, root surface area and root volume were not affected at 24 degrees C but severely reduced under 28 degrees C upon Fol inoculation. A reduction of root morphological parameters was not observed in S. herbamans + Fol treated plants at 28 degrees C indicating a protective effect against Fol. Moreover, root morphological traits appear to be more influenced by the different temperatures than root dry weights. In additional in-vitro experiments, growth promoting effects of S. herbamans on root traits without direct contact were evident indicating the involvement of volatile organic compounds in growth promotion. In conclusion, S. herbamans provides protection against the temperature-dependent damage Fol inflicts on the tomato plants by reducing disease development under 24 degrees C and by mitigating reduction in root morphological parameters under 28 degrees C in the early weeks of interaction.","Sefloo, NG; Steinkellner, S; Hage-Ahmed, K",RHIZOSPHERE,2021,10.1016/j.rhisph.2021.100453,0.955500261269306,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.942157936972582,0.057842063027418,0.999999999337694,6.62305654763884e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10275,Soil eutrophication reduces fungal colonization in Berberis microphylla roots in Patagonia (Argentina),"Soil eutrophication can trigger drastic changes in biological interactions. However, it is not clear, particularly in forest ecosystems, how different symbiotic microorganisms respond to eutrophication or how responses might differ according to the nutrients involved (e.g., additive vs. interactive effects). In this study we evaluated how arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and dark septate endophyte (DSE) colonization of Berberis microphylla, a native shrub, was affected by the addition of inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. We used a factorial experimental design (8 fertilization treatments applied to 31.5 x 45 m plots) in R & iacute;o Negro (Argentina). We found that N and P fertilization reduced mycorrhizal colonization, while N, P and K fertilization reduced DSE colonization; however, we found no additive effect on either mycorrhizal or DSE colonization. Mycorrhization percentages were close to 20% in the control and potassium-only plots, and between 3 and 5% in the remaining treatments. DSE colonized over 50% of plants in the control plots, whereas this value fell below 20% with fertilization. Our results show that changes in even a single soil nutrient can severely affect these fungal-plant associations, evidencing the high impact of eutrophication on forest soils. Considering the crucial role of these symbiotic interactions, it is essential to control anthropogenic eutrophication.","Fioroni, F; Fernandez, NV; Martinez, LC; Garibaldi, LA",SYMBIOSIS,2024,10.1007/s13199-024-01026-x,0.951980042372389,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997105840324262,0.00289415967573758,0.999999992987855,7.012145419871271e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6739,Isolation and identification of flavonoid-producing endophytic fungi from medicinal plant Conyza blinii H.Lev that exhibit higher antioxidant and antibacterial activities,"Background. Conyza blinii H. Lev is a medicinal plant that has a variety of pharmacological activities, but its study is at a standstill due to the shortage of resources. Method. This study utilized the surface sterilization method to isolate endophytic fungi, and they were preliminarily identified by morphology. Flavonoid-producing strains were screened by NaNO2-Al(NO)(3) colorimetry and further identified by the ITS sequence. Additionally, we used five antioxidant assays (DPPH, Hydroxyl radical, ABTS, FRAP and T-AOC assays) to systematically evaluate the antioxidant capacity of total flavonoids, and we also determined their antibacterial activity. Results. In this study, 21 endophytic fungi were isolated from wild Conyza blinii H. Lev for the first time. There were six flavonoid-producing strains, especially CBL11, whose total flavonoid content reached 50.78 +/- 2.4 mg/L. CBL12, CBL12-2 and CBL1-1 all exhibited excellent antioxidant activity. The effect of CBL12 was similar to that of ascorbic acid at low concentrations, and its radical scavenging rates for DPPH and ABTS were 94.56 +/- 0.29 % and 99.88 +/- 0.27%, respectively, while its IC50 values were only 0.11 +/- 0.01 mg/mL and 0.2 +/- 0.01 mg/mL. Through LC-MS, we found that CBL12 could produce many high-value flavonoids, such as 3-methoxyflavone, nobiletin, formononetin, scopoletin, and daidzein. Additionally, CBL9 had good antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Notably, we obtained the high-yield strains CBL12 and CBL9, which not only had high yields (10.64 +/- 1.01 mg/L and 10.17 +/- 0.11 mg/L, respectively) but also had excellent biological activity. Hence, the results of this study provide new ideas for endophytic fungi that can be exploited as a source of flavonoids and other medicinal components from Conyza blinii H. Lev. Moreover, this study can serve as a reference for the development of rare medicinal materials.","Tang, ZZ; Wang, YS; Yang, JY; Xiao, YR; Cai, Y; Wan, YJ; Chen, H; Yao, HP; Shan, Z; Li, CL; Wang, G",PEERJ,2020,10.7717/peerj.8978,0.967452820564476,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.906391423772309,0.093608576227691,0.999991513973331,8.48602666869702e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1108,Characterization of mannitol in Curvularia protuberata hyphae by FTIR and Raman spectromicroscopy,"FTIR and Raman spectromicroscopy were used to characterize the composition of Curvularia protuberata hyphae, and to compare a strain isolated from plants inhabiting geothermal soils with a non-geothermal isolate. Thermal IR source images of hyphae have been acquired with a 64 x 64 element focal plane array detector; single point IR spectra have been obtained with synchrotron source light. In some C. protuberata hyphae, we have discovered the spectral signature of crystalline mannitol, a fungal polyol with complex protective roles. With FTIR-FPA imaging, we have determined that the protein content in cells remains fairly constant throughout the length of a hypha, whereas the mannitol is found at discrete, irregular locations. This is the first direct observation of mannitol in intact fungal hyphae. Since the concentration of mannitol in cells varies with respect to position and is not present in all hyphae, this discovery may be related to habitat adaptation, fungal structure and growth stages.","Isenor, M; Kaminskyj, SGW; Rodriguez, RJ; Redman, RS; Gough, KM",ANALYST,2010,10.1039/c0an00534g,0.941073076678432,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999951756658739,4.82433412609115e-5,0.999999999999987,1.31006316905768e-14,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18449,Endophytic root bacteria associated with the natural vegetation growing at the hydrocarbon-contaminated Bitumount Provincial Historic site.,"The Bitumount Provincial Historic site is the location of 2 of the world's first oil-extracting and -refining operations. Despite hydrocarbon levels ranging from 330 to 24 700 mg·(kg soil)-1, plants have been able to recolonize the site through means of natural revegetation. This study was designed to achieve a better understanding of the plant-root-associated bacterial partnerships occurring within naturally revegetated hydrocarbon-contaminated soils. Root endophytic bacterial communities were characterized from representative plant species throughout the site by both high-throughput sequencing and culturing techniques. Population abundance of rhizosphere and root endosphere bacteria was significantly influenced (p < 0.05) by plant species and sampling location. In general, members of the Actinomycetales, Rhizobiales, Pseudomonadales, Burkholderiales, and Sphingomonadales orders were the most commonly identified orders. Community structure of root-associated bacteria was influenced by both plant species and sampling location. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the potential functional diversity of the root endophytic bacteria. The gene copy numbers of 16S rRNA and 2 hydrocarbon-degrading genes (CYP153 and alkB) were significantly affected (p < 0.05) by the interaction of plant species and sampling location.

2331,Inbred progeny of tall fescue infected with Epichloe fungal endophyte have a high defence compound content and no depression in seed set,"Substantial evidence is available on the capacity of particular strains of Epichloe fungal endophyte to remove the barriers of self-pollination in host grasses. We hypothesized that this might open up new methods to obtain inbred lines for specific turf hybrids and genetic studies. In the present study, we evaluated the first generation of self-pollination derived plants of endophyte infected clones (EIS1) from putative genotypes 75B+ and 75C+ and those from the first generation of self-pollination in six commercial tall fescue clones plus their hybrids with 75B- and 75C- for growth, seed yield and polyphenolic content as an index for biosynthesis of defence compounds under field conditions. The results showed that EIS1 had high hyphal density within leaf sheaths and higher growth and seed-related traits in at least one genotype. There were higher amounts of flavonoid and phenolic compounds (up to twofold) in both genotypes than in their hybrid counterparts and endophyte-free progeny. Selected genotypes within EIS1 contained significantly more chlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid and rutin than the best non-infected genotypes. We conclude that phenotypic selection of individuals from the S-1 population is feasible for improving fitness and stress resistance in novel inbred lines of tall fescue for development of new turf cultivars with the desired ecophysiological traits.","Raahbar, A; Sabzalian, MR; Maibody, SAMM; Zarean, M",PLANT BIOLOGY,2022,10.1111/plb.13422,0.992867318560841,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993490486905083,0.00650951309491734,0.999999999989496,1.05043751474909e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
8463,Identification of endophytic fungi from Livistona chinensis based on morphology and rDNA sequences,"A survey of the endophytic fungi in fronds of Livistona chinensis was carried out in Hong Kong. The endophyte assemblages identified using morphological characters consisted of 16 named species and 19 'morphospecies', the latter grouped based on cultural morphology and growth rates. Arrangement of taxa into morphospecies does not reflect species phylogeny, and therefore selected morphospecies were further identified based on ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence analysis. The 5.8S gene and flanking internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) regions of rDNA from 19 representative morphospecies were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis based on 5.8S gene sequences showed that these morphospecies were filamentous Ascomycota, belonging in the Loculoascomycetes and Pyrenomycetes. Further identification was conducted by means of sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of both the ITS and 5.8S regions. Results showed that MS704 belonged to the genus Diaporthe and its anamorph Phomopsis of the Valsaceae. MS594 was inferred to be Mycosphaerella and its anamorph Cladosporium of the Mycosphaerellaceae. MS339, MS366, MS370, MS395, MS1033, MS1083 and MS1092 were placed in the genus Xylaria of the Xylariaceae, MS194, MS375 and MS1028 were close to the Clypeosphaeriaceae. MS191 and MS316 were closely related to the Pleosporaceae within the Dothideales. The other 5 morphospecies, MS786, MS1043, MS1065, MS1076 and MS1095, probably belong in the Xylariales. The value of using DNA sequence analysis in the identification of endophytes is discussed.","Guo, LD; Hyde, KD; Liew, ECY",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,2000,10.1046/j.1469-8137.2000.00716.x,0.768221042215385,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.783555076927599,0.216444923072401,0.999977620987262,2.23790127384937e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

17432,First Report of Fusarium Wilt of Tobacco Caused by Fusarium kyushuense in China.,"Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) is a leafy, annual, solanaceous plant grown commercially for its leaves. China accounts for more than 39.6% of total global tobacco production (3). In May 2012, seedlings of tobacco cv. Honghuadajinyuan in a Guiyang tobacco commercial field (Guizhou, China, 26.35° N, 106.42° E) developed symptoms of severe wilting, chlorosis, and stunting. The main stem and taproot exhibited reddish to light brown vascular discoloration; further progression of these symptoms eventually caused mortality of infected seedlings. To isolate the causal agent, necrotic tissues from the symptomatic root were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25°C in darkness. Colonies with white to rose mycelia and red-brown colony colors developed on PDA after 5 days of incubation. Microconidia were abundant, straight or slightly curved, clavate, 0- to 3-septate, and 7.5 to 20.0 × 2.5 to 5.0 μm. Macroconidia were straight or slightly curved, slender, 3- to 5-septate, and 25.0 to 45.0 × 3.3 to 5.0 μm. Based on the observed colony attributes, growth patterns, absence of chlamydospores, micro- and macro-spore attributes (1), and PCR amplification (using primers ITS1/4) combined with translation elongation factor primers (EF1/2) (2), the fungus was identified as F. kyushuense O'Donnell & T. Aoki. Sequence of ITS1-5.8s-ITS2 region of rDNA (GenBank Accession No. JX235957) exactly matched the sequences of F. kyushuense accession AB587020.1 (100% similarity). Analysis of the elongation factor (EF-1alpha) gene of the fungus (JX658565) resulted in a 99% match for F. kyushuense accession AB674297.1. Pathogenicity of the fungus was confirmed by performing Koch's postulate as follows. Pure cultures of the fungus F. kyushuense obtained from symptomatic tissues of tobacco seedlings were grown on PDA for 6 days. Tobacco plants to be used in pathogenicity tests were germinated and grown on potting soils in a plastic container. Additional fertilization was supplied by adding 0.2 g/L of 20-20-20 (N-P-K) in the float water. When seedlings got 6-leaf stage, they were ready for pathogenicity tests. Spores harvested from these culture plates were suspended in sterile distilled water, adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 104 conidia/ml, and inoculated by irrigating 10 ml of the conidia suspension onto roots of each of the 12 tobacco seedlings with 6-leaf stage. A group of 12 seedlings of the same age treated with sterile water served as control. Inoculated seedlings were maintained at 25°C, 100 μE m-2.s-1, relative humidity >70%, and 16 h light per day, and monitored for 9 days for symptom development. Seedlings inoculated with conidia developed disease symptoms with roots with vascular discoloration of roots whereas control seedlings remained symptomless. F. kyushuense was reisolated from the symptomatic seedlings 9 days after inoculation. F. kyushuense has also been isolated from rice seeds in China (4), and from diseased wheat in Japan (1). The common tobacco Fusarium disease reported in China was caused by F. oxysporium f. sp. nicotianae. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of F. kyushuense causing wilt on tobacco in China and the disease must be considered in existing disease management practices.

1842,Endophytic Beauveria bassiana in sugarcane and associated Eldana saccharina host plants in South Africa,"Eldana saccharina Walker is a problematic sugarcane stalk borer pest in South Africa. Twenty-eight sugarcane genotypes (Saccharum spp. hybrids) and seven different species of host plants of E. saccharina were surveyed for the presence of endophytic Beauveria bassianasensu lato (s.l.). Collectively, 326 plant samples (roots, stems, or leaves) were collected from five locations in sugarcane-producing areas (KwaZulu-Natal; South Africa). Following plant surface disinfection, 128 fungal colonies morphologically resembling Beauveria spp. were isolated from internal plant tissues. The sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region confirmed that 13 representative isolates were B. bassiana.s.l. Eight B. bassiana isolates were recovered from E. saccharina natural host plants, and 120 from different sugarcane stem parts (top node, top internodes, bottom node, and bottom internode). Endophytic B. bassiana isolates were recovered from 22 of 28 sugarcane genotypes surveyed. The number of B. bassiana isolates obtained from different sugarcane parts differed significantly, with more B. bassiana isolates obtained from the top than the bottom internodes. Furthermore, sugarcane genotypes N31 and N41 yielded B. bassiana from all plant parts sampled, while five sugarcane genotypes harbored no B. bassiana isolates. This study demonstrates for the first time the natural occurrence of endophytic B. bassiana strains in sugarcane plants and E. saccharina host plants in South Africa.","Memela, NS; Rutherford, RS; Schmidt, S",BIOCONTROL,2024,10.1007/s10526-024-10257-2,0.990709276458184,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999984597262381,1.54027376191173e-5,0.999999999931647,6.83533230017019e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6364,Antibiotic Activity of aParaphaeosphaeria sporulosa-Produced Diketopiperazine againstSalmonella enterica,"A diketopiperazine has been purified from a culture filtrate of the endophytic fungusParaphaeosphaeria sporulosa, isolated from healthy tissues of strawberry plants in a survey of microbes as sources of anti-bacterial metabolites. Its structure has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses and was found to be identical tocyclo(L-Pro-L-Phe) purified from species of other fungal genera. This secondary metabolite has been selected following bioguided-assay fractionation against two strains ofSalmonella enterica, the causal agent of bovine gastroenteritis. The diketopiperazinecyclo(L-Pro-L-Phe), isolated for the first time fromParaphaeosphaeriaspecies, showed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 71.3 and 78.6 mu g/mL against the twoS.entericastrains. This finding may be significant in limiting the use of synthetic antibiotics in animal husbandry and reducing the emergence of bacterial multidrug resistance. Further in vivo experiments ofP. sporulosadiketopiperazines are important for the future application of these metabolites.","Carrieri, R; Borriello, G; Piccirillo, G; Lahoz, E; Sorrentino, R; Cermola, M; Censi, SB; Grauso, L; Mangoni, A; Vinale, F",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2020,10.3390/jof6020083,0.978725829833724,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998626044562157,0.00137395543784342,0.999999999278303,7.21697257510812e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16706,First Report of Silybum marianum as a Host of Puccinia punctiformis.,"Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertn. (milk thistle) is a problematic invasive weed in the western United States. The rust fungus, Puccinia punctiformis (F. Strauss) Rohl., is found throughout the world as a pathogen of Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop. (Canadian thistle). Recently, plants of S. marianum grown from surface-disinfested seeds in our quarantine greenhouse were parasitized by a rust. Apparently, an isolate of P. punctiformis collected from C. arvense in Turkey that was present in the greenhouse had spread to adjacent S. marianum plants and caused infection without applying any artificial dew period. Ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region sequences from fungal spore DNA isolated from the two hosts were identical. Initial signs on S. marianum were abundant, fragrant spermogonia on large leaves. These signs occur on secondary shoots of C. arvense and are indicative of systemic fungal infection (1). As the fungus infection developed on S. marianum, uredinia and urediniospores were produced. Sori on older leaves also produced teliospores. Urediniospores from infected leaves were harvested and sprayed uniformly on eight 17-day-old plants of S. marianum grown in isolation from P. punctiformis. The spore suspension consisted of 4 mg urediniospores suspended in 40 ml distilled water. Inoculated plants were incubated for 18 h in a dew chamber at 20°C in the dark and transferred to a greenhouse (20 to 25°C, 30 to 50% relative humidity, and natural light). After 13 days, uredia with urediniospores developed on four of the plants. Using the same procedure, inoculations were repeated on plants of S. marianum and S. eburneum Coss. & Durieu (the only other species described in the genus) with urediniospores of a domestic isolate of the fungus from C. arvense in Maryland. Of 51 inoculated plants of S. marianum, 23 became infected and produced uredinia. None of the 12 inoculated plants of S. eburneum showed symptoms of infection. In nature, C. arvense and S. marianum occupy different ecological areas. C. arvense is found predominately in humid temperate habitats, while S. marianum is found in habitats with a dry Mediterranean climate. Life cycles of each host are also different. C. arvense is a perennial that emerges in spring and dies back in winter, while S. marianum is a winter annual that emerges in fall and dies in late spring. Because of the differences in life cycles combined with the different geographical distribution, P. punctiformis from C. arvense may rarely encounter susceptible S. marianum plants in the field. Since fungal spores can be produced routinely on artificially inoculated plants, there might be potential to use P. punctiformis for biological control of S. marianum. To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. marianum as a host for P. punctiformis. Reference: (1) A. H. R. Buller. Puccinia sauveolens and its sexual process. Page 345 in: Researches on Fungi.

14780,Is Zymoseptoria tritici a hemibiotroph?,"The growth of microorganisms in planta is often categorized based on their methods of nutrient acquisition and the physical appearance of symptoms on the host. For example, biotrophs thrive on living tissue while necrotrophic pathogens often quickly lyse cells to access nutrients. Hemibiotrophs are pathogens that initially feed on living host tissue without causing visible symptoms prior to switching to necrotrophy. During infection of wheat, the pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici undergoes a prolonged and asymptomatic phase during which it grows slowly and protects itself from host defenses prior to eliciting a strong necrotic response. However careful analyses of the asymptomatic phase indicate that the pathogen does not alter host growth, casting doubt on the biotrophic nature of this asymptomatic period. Consequently, we question whether Z. tritici is correctly defined as a hemibiotroph. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Sánchez-Vallet A.; McDonald M.C.; Solomon P.S.; McDonald B.A.,Fungal Genetics and Biology,2015,10.1016/j.fgb.2015.04.001,0.972507914914786,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998342292010615,0.0016577079893847,0.999999883526907,1.16473092837133e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5341,Diversity and phylogeny of Neofusicoccum species occurring in forest and urban environments in Portugal,"A collection of Neofusicoccum isolates was obtained from a large number of plant species, showing dieback and canker symptoms, in forest and urban environments in Portugal. A total of 351 isolates was characterised by BOX-PCR fingerprinting to evaluate their overall genetic diversity. Representatives of each group identified in this analysis were selected for multilocus sequence analyses, using sequences of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS rDNA) and partial sequences of the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) and beta-tubulin (tub2). Phylogenetic analysis of multilocus sequence data identified five species within the collection of isolates, namely N. australe, N. eucalyptorum, N. kwambonambiense, N. luteum, and N. parvum. Of these N. australe and N. eucalyptorum were the most frequent representing the vast majority of the isolates. Several new fungus-host associations were established for all of the Neofusicoccum species found. Here we report for the first time the occurrence of N. eucalyptorum on a host outside the family Myrtaceae. The results of this study show that the genus Neofusicocccum appears to be common and widespread on a broad range of hosts representing a potential threat to susceptible plants.

3109,FITTING PLANTS TO SOIL THROUGH MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI - MYCORRHIZA EFFECTS ON PLANT-GROWTH AND SOIL ORGANIC-MATTER,"Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi affect diverse aspects of plant form and function. Since mycorrhiza-mediated changes in host-plant responses to root colonization by different VAM fungi vary widely, it is important to assess each endophyte for each specific effect it can elicit from its host as part of the screening process for effectiveness. Three species of VAM fungi and a mixture of species were compared with non-VAM controls for their effects on soil organic matter contents and on nutrition and morphology in two varieties (native and hybrid) of corn (Zea mays L.) and one of sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) in P-sufficient and N-deficient soil in pot cultures. Differences in soil organic matter due to the fungal applications were highly significant with all host plants. Native corn responded more to VAM colonization than the hybrid did; differences in treatments were significant in leaf area, plant biomass, and root: shoot ratio in the former, but not in the latter. Responses in the sunflower were similar to those in the native corn. Significant VAM treatment-related differences in shoot N and P contents were not reflected in shoot biomass, which was invariant. Correlations between plant or soil parameters and the intensity of VAM colonization were found only in soil organic matter with the native corn, in specific leaf area in the hybrid corn, and in plant biomass in the sunflower. The presence of the different endophytes and not the intensity of colonization apparently elicited different host responses.","QUINTERORAMOS, M; ESPINOZAVICTORIA, D; FERRERACERRATO, R; BETHLENFALVAY, GJ",BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS,1993,10.1007/BF00336426,0.999733678380596,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.935543870371107,0.0644561296288928,0.999996182056326,3.81794367410038e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

2299,A MICROSATELLITE MARKER FOR STUDYING THE ECOLOGY AND DIVERSITY OF FUNGAL ENDOPHYTES (EPICHLOE SPP) IN GRASSES,"Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting, which is based on PCR with arbitrary 10-nucleotide primers, were used to analyze genetic diversity among isolates of the endophytic ascomycete Epichloe typhina, which were collected at a single field site from a population of one of its hosts, the grass Bromus erectus. One of the polymorphic randomly amplified polymorphic DNA PCR products occurred in all isolates as single bands with different but closely related sizes. Two of the size variants of this product were cloned and sequenced, and they were found to represent the same DNA sequence, except for a stretch of tandem repeats of the trinucleotide AAG . TTC, which differed in size, consisting of 8 and 18 repeats, respectively. Tandem repeats of this type are called microsatellites. Oligonucleotides were synthesized corresponding to portions of the sequence flanking the microsatellite and were used for PCR amplification of the loci from the genomic DNAs of different Epichloe isolates. A single PCR product was found for most isolates, indicating that the sequence represented a single genetic locus. Five alleles that could clearly be distinguished in size were found in a population of 91 field isolates. PCR with (AAC)(8) and (AAG)(8) as primers yielded a number of amplified bands from genomic DNA of Epichloe isolates, indicating that these types of microsatellites occur frequently in the genome of this fungus. A survey of all fungal DNA sequences currently deposited in the DNA sequence databases of EMBL and GenBank revealed that microsatellites of different repeating units are widespread in fungi. Our findings indicate that microsatellite-containing loci may be used as molecular markers for population studies of Epichloe species and many other unrelated fungi.","GROPPE, K; SANDERS, I; WIEMKEN, A; BOLLER, T",APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,1995,10.1128/AEM.61.11.3943-3949.1995,0.992824504114814,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.978043095486361,0.0219569045136385,0.999994853458893,5.14654110728152e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

15778,Five novel and highly efficient endophytic fungi isolated from Huperzia serrata expressing huperzine A for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease,"Abstract: Huperzine A (Hup A) is an important drug for treating Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and mainly extracted from the Huperzia serrata (Thunb.) Trevis. (Lycopodiaceae) (HS). Nevertheless, the content of Hup A in HS is very low of 0.007% with growing circle of 8 to 10 years, and the chemical synthesis of Hup A still has some insurmountable limitations in the industrialized production. So, the available resources of Hup A for clinical treatment of AD are scarce. The purpose of this work was to construct a biosynthesis platform based on the endophytic fungi from HS. In this work, five endophytic fungi Mucor racemosus NSH-D, Mucor fragilis NSY-1, Fusarium verticillioides NSH-5, Fusarium oxysporum NSG-1, and Trichoderma harzianum NSW-V were firstly found and isolated from the Chinese folk medicine HS, which were identified according to their morphological characteristics and nuclear ribosomal DNA ITS sequences. The highest efficient fungus could effectively biosynthesize Hup A in a liquid culture of 319.8 ± 0.17 mg/L which were 112 times higher than that of other reported conventional endophytic fungi. Moreover, these fungi with higher hereditary stability could possess the initial expressing ability of Hup A after 40 generations, and the expressed Hup A from these biosynthesis systems has prior physicochemical properties, a better inhibition activity of acetylcholinesterase and a lower cytotoxicity compared with the listed active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) of Hup A. These results provide promising alternative resources for producing Hup A at an industrial scale by biosynthesis, and it may also shed light on millions of AD patients.

7777,Can Epichloe endophytes enhance direct and indirect plant defence?,"Induced or constitutive production of secondary metabolites is a successful plant defence strategy against herbivores which can be mediated by plant associated micro-organisms. Several grass species can be associated with an endophytic fungus of the genus Epichloe which produces herbivore toxic or deterring alkaloids. Besides these direct defences, herbivorous insects are controlled via indirect plant defence mechanisms by attracting predators. Recent studies indicate that Epichloe endophytes can improve the grass emitted volatile organic compounds towards herbivore deterrence. Due to their defensive mutualistic function, we hypothesize that Epichloe altered plant volatiles can attract aphid predators and contribute to an increased indirect plant defence. With a common garden study, we show that hoverfly (Syrphidae) larvae and pupae were more abundant on endophyte-infected plants compared to uninfected plants. Our results indicate that the Epichloe endophyte provides, besides direct defence (alkaloid), indirect plant defence by improving the plant odor attracting more olfactory foraging aphid predators. Future research is needed in order to understand: (I) whether endophyte-mediated changes in plant volatiles are induced herbivore specific, (II) whether there is a trade-off between endophytemediated direct and indirect plant defence, (Ill) whether the endophyte produces volatiles or induces a change in plant -derived volatiles, (IV) the role of plant signals in endophyte-mediated plant defence.

16208,"New records of Neopestalotiopsis species associated with leaves of Annona muricata (Soursop) and Garcinia mangostana (Mangosteen) in the Western Province, Sri Lanka, and in vitro evaluation of selected biocontrol agents for their growth suppression","Most pestalotioid species are phytopathogens characterized by conidia with appendages and can also function as endophytes and saprobes. During a morpho-molecular study of plant-inhabiting micro-fungi in Sri Lanka, two pestalotioid species were isolated from the lesions of living leaves of Garcinia mangostana and Annona muricata. Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference analyses of combined internal transcribed spacers (ITS), β-tubulin (tub2), and translation elongation factor 1-α (tef1-α) sequence data were used to determine the phylogenetic affinities of the collected species. Detailed morphological and multi-locus phylogenetic analyses further validated that the collected pestalotioid species belonged to Neopestalotiopsis. Neopestalotiopsis cubana (GMBUCC 24–001) and N. scalabiensis (GMBUCC 24–002 and GMBUCC 24–003) were identified as associated with the fresh leaves of G. mangostana and A. muricata, respectively.

3182,Metabolomics insights into the mechanism by which Epichloe gansuensis endophyte increased Achnatherum inebrians tolerance to low nitrogen stress,"Background and aim Epichloe gansuensis increases the tolerance of host plants to abiotic stress. However, little is known about the mechanism by which E. gansuensis improves grass growth under low nitrogen availability stress. Methods Achnatherum inebrians with E. gansuensis (E+) and without E. gansuensis (E-) were treated with modified 1/2 Hoagland containing 0.01 mM (low N) or 7.5 mM N (normal level) for 18 weeks. After 18 weeks of treatment with N, the dry weight of E+ and E- plants were measured, and the metabolomics analysis of leaves and roots grown under two different N concentrations was conducted with GS-MS to determine differential metabolites and metabolic pathways. Result E+ A. inebrians had higher dry weight of leaves and roots compared to the E- A. inebrians under low N stress. E. gansuensis increased the tolerance of A. inebrians to low N stress by its capability to increase the content of organic acids (salicylic acid and 3-hydroxypropionic acid) and glucose-6-phosphate in leaves, and E. gansuensis increased the content of fatty acids (linolenic acid and oleic acid) and amino acids (glycine and 4-aminobutyric acid) in roots under low N stress. Finally, E. gansuensis reprogramed the metabolic pathway of amino acids of host grasses to adapt to the different N concentration. Conclusion Our results reveal the chemical mechanism by which E. gansuensis enhances the tolerance of host grasses to low N, and provide the theoretical basis for utilizing E. gansuensis, improving of grasses and crops, and for developing new germplasm for low-N tolerant grasses.","Hou, WP; Wang, JF; Christensen, MJ; Liu, J; Zhang, YQ; Liu, YL; Cheng, C",PLANT AND SOIL,2021,10.1007/s11104-021-04930-z,0.917825785803529,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991646895809829,0.0083531041901708,0.999999999972755,2.7244650979696397e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Aryl acid metabolism of X. arbuscula included GABA incorporation and glycosylation when the substrates were p-bromobenzoic and p-chlorobenzoic acids were also observed. The substrates p-hydroxybenzoic and p-aminobenzoic acids were not transformed. These results could suggest that electron-withdrawing groups at para orientation activate the substrate for reduction.

10312,Studies on the secondary metabolism of Rosellinia and Dematophora strains (Xylariaceae) from Iran,"The xylariaceous genus Dematophora has recently been resurrected and segregated from Rosellinia based on a molecular phylogeny and morphological characters. This was an important taxonomic change because Dematophora in the current sense contains several important pathogens, while Rosellinia is limited to mainly saprotrophic species that have an endophytic stage in their life cycle and may even have beneficial effects on the host plants. During our ongoing work on the functional biodiversity of the Xylariales, we have encountered new strains of rosellinoid Xylariaceae from Iran and have studied their mycelial cultures for secondary metabolites in an attempt to establish further chemotaxonomic affinities. In the process, we isolated and identified 13 compounds, of which rosellisteroid (1), the cichorine derivative 2, and the alkaloid 3 are new. Out of these, nine were tested for their antimicrobial affinities with cytochalasin E (6) exhibiting weak activity against Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The cytotoxicity of three cytochalasin derivatives was examined and their effects on the F-actin cytoskeletal organization studied by fluorescence microscopy using fluorescent phalloidin. Cytochalasin E (6) and Delta(6,12)-cytochalasin E (7) showed strong and irreversible action on actin, while cytochalasin K (8) exhibited weaker, reversible effects.","Pourmoghaddam, MJ; Ekiz, G; Lambert, C; Surup, F; Primahana, G; Wittstein, K; Khodaparast, SA; Voglmayr, H; Krisai-Greilhuber, I; Stradal, TEB; Stadler, M",MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS,2022,10.1007/s11557-022-01816-x,0.826668793816185,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.97808795133245,0.0219120486675498,0.999999849334529,1.5066547065512e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5203,Bacterial endophytes mediate positive feedback effects of early legume termination times on the yield of subsequent durum wheat crops,"Field crops influence the biotic properties of the soil, impacting the health and productivity of subsequent crops. Polymerase chain reaction and 454 GS FLX pyrosequencing of amplicons were used to clarify the legacy of chickpea and pea crops on the quality of the bacterial community colonizing the root endosphere of subsequent crops of wheat, in a replicated field study. Similar communities of root endosphere bacteria were formed in durum wheat grown after pea and chickpea crops when chickpea crops were terminated as early as pea (July). Termination of the chickpea crops in September led to the domination of Firmicutes in wheat root endosphere; Actinobacteria dominated the wheat root endosphere following early pulse crop termination. The architecture of wheat plants was correlated with the composition of its root endosphere community. High grain yield was associated with the production of fewer but larger wheat heads, the abundance of endospheric Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria, and the scarcity of endospheric Firmicutes. Pulse termination time affected wheat root endosphere colonization strongly in 2009 but weakly in 2010, an abnormally wet year. This study improved our understanding of the so-called ""crop rotation effect"" in pulse-wheat systems and showed how this system can be manipulated through agronomic decisions.","Yang, C; Hamel, C; Gan, YT; Vujanovic, V",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY,2012,10.1139/w2012-114,0.997572382104903,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992063184104507,0.00793681589549339,0.999999999980894,1.9106272119984198e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
8347,Distribution of Diplodia pinea and its genotypic diversity within asymptomatic Pinus patula trees,"Diplodia pinea (= Sphaeropsis sapinea) is an endophytic fungus and opportunistic canker pathogen of Pinus spp. The diversity of this fungus has been studied at broad geographic scales, but little is known regarding its population structure at smaller spatial scales such as within a single tree. This is despite the importance that diversity in a single tree might hold for understanding the biology of the fungus, especially the role of the endophytic or asymptomatic phase in disease development. Moreover there was not information regarding the distribution of the fungus within healthy trees and its persistence. The genotypic diversity of these isolates was investigated using microsatellite markers. Five polymorphic markers were developed and these were used together with eight previously developed markers and vegetative compatibility tests to study the genotypic diversity of D. pinea isolates. In this study, D. pinea was isolated for the first time in the well structured stems of healthy P. patula trees along with branches and cones. From a total of 44 isolates collected from five trees, 39 microsatellite haplotypes and 32 vegetative compatibility groups (VCG's) were identified. The results indicate high genotypic diversity of D. pinea within individual asymptomatic trees which will lead to disease outbreak when trees are physiologically stressed.","Bihon, W; Burgess, T; Slippers, B; Wingfield, MJ; Wingfield, BD",AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY,2011,10.1007/s13313-011-0060-z,0.803959781710885,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994665131046211,0.00533486895378926,0.999997745650697,2.25434930278823e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
7714,Larvicidal activity of endophytic fungal extract of Cochliobolus spicifer (Pleosporales: Pleosporaceae) on Aedes caspius and Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae),"Endophytic microorganisms are fungi or bacteria which live inside plant tissues or organs, without causing them any harmful symptoms. Indeed, since many are also able to produce substances of biotechnological interest, they may protect the plant from insect attacks and diseases. The date palm, Phoenix dactylifera (Linnaeus) is a tree which has been known in Saudi Arabia for thousands of years as a staple food. The aim of the present work was to investigate the inhibitory activity of crude extracts of the fungal endophyte Cochliobolus spicifer (Nelson), isolated from the date palm, against Aedes caspius (Pallas) and Culex pipiens (Linnaeus) larvae. In addition, histological changes were determined in the digestive system of treated third instar larvae. The data showed that C. spicifer interfered with the developmental cycle of the mosquito, and had its strongest toxic effect (with 100 % mortality in third instar larvae) at concentrations of 300 ppm. This compound did not show toxicity to zebrafish. The third instar larvae treated with the active fraction showed cellular destruction and disorganization, cell spacing, and vacuolization of epithelial cells in small regions of the midgut. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to report the isolation of endophytic fungi C. spicifer from date palm trees (P. dactylifera). The endophytic fungal extract of C. spicifer proved to be a strong candidate for a natural, safe, and stable phytolarvicidal to be used in population control of Ae. caspius and Cx. pipiens.","Abutaha, N; Mashaly, AMA; Al-Mekhlafi, FA; Farooq, M; Al-shami, M; Wadaan, MA",APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY,2015,10.1007/s13355-015-0347-6,0.985136201820912,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995966868826314,0.00403313117368551,0.99999999112623,8.87376983005339e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2509,Effect of hybridization on endophytes: the endo-microbiome dynamics,"In this era of dwindling natural resources and climate change, the target of increasing crop production for feeding 10 billion people by the year 2050 has mounted huge pressure on the scientific community. The cultivation of hybrid varieties has contributed immensely towards food security and made it possible to meet the requirements of the rapidly increasing human population. A typical plant breeding approach involves hybridization i.e. crossing two genetically different individuals, to create genetic variation. At the genetic level, the genomes of two individuals combine to form a hybrid, but what happens to the associated microbiota is largely unknown. Endophytes are one such class of plant-associated microbiota that have been reported to inhabit the internal tissues of plants, without causing any disease symptoms. With the advent of the holobiome concept, the importance of microbiome in plant health and productivity is being increasingly realized. In this perspective, understanding the nature of plant-endophyte association in hybrids and transmission/colonization of endophytes upon hybridization (i.e. from parents to progenies) is a pre-requisite for laying the foundation of plant holobiont breeding. This emerging discipline aims to integrate the best of both worlds (hybrid plant genome and microbiome) for realizing the untapped potential of the plant microbiota (and hence, the holobiont) to adverse environmental conditions. This review attempts to summarize our current understanding of the hybrid plant-associated microbiome with respect to its parental lines and wild progenitors. Further, the review highlights some research gaps in the field and beckons the attention of scientific community towards understanding and applying this knowledge for further boosting the crop productivity, the need of the hour.","Sahu, PK; Mishra, S",SYMBIOSIS,2021,10.1007/s13199-021-00760-w,0.989513119143025,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996561817167403,0.00343818283259692,0.99999999734543,2.65457011927595e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

16715,First Report of Sudden Death Syndrome of Soybean in Delaware and Eastern Shore of Maryland.,"In August and September of 2000, soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) plants from two fields in Sussex County, Delaware, and one field from Somerset County on the eastern shore of Maryland exhibited typical symptoms of sudden death syndrome. The season had been wetter and cooler than normal. Leaf symptoms ranged from small chlorotic spots to elongated regions of interveinal necrosis. Leaflets dropped leaving attached petioles in the upper canopy. Severely infected plants were easily pulled from the soil and had taproots with blue sporodochia, necrotic cortical tissue, and necrosis of secondary roots (2). Initial isolations from the infected plants were made from the basal stems, discolored taproots, vascular tissue, and directly from blue sporodochia. Sections were plated on water agar (WA) amended with neomycin and streptomycin, WA with antibiotics and chloramphenicol, and acidified potato dextrose agar (PDA). The isolates were slow growing on PDA, often staining agar dark maroon, produced little aerial mycelium, and formed macroconidia in blue sporodochia. The fungus was identified as Fusarium solani (Mart.) Sacc. based on spore morphology. Plugs (5 mm) of the fungus from 14-day-old cultures were placed next to the stem just below the soil line of 14-day-old plants of soybean cvs. Essex and Lee 74. Eighteen plants of each cultivar (three per pot) were inoculated and placed on a greenhouse bench for 43 days at 21°C (±2°C). Six noninoculated control plants were also included. Plants were rated for the presence of stem lesions and foliar symptoms. Of the inoculated plants, 70% had mottling, rugosity, and leaf cupping, 6% had severe interveinal leaf necrosis, and 52% had distinct stem lesions at the soil line. Control plants were symptomless. F. solani was recovered from all symptomatic plants and presumed to be F. solani f. sp. glycines based on spore morphology, color, lack of microconidia, and symptoms (1). A more extensive test was conducted to confirm Koch's postulates. Eleven isolates of F. solani f. sp. glycines were grown as before and used to inoculate Essex soybeans as previously described. Inoculated and control plants were randomized on the greenhouse bench and watered using an individual pot irrigation system. Fifty-six days after inoculation plant height was reduced 12% compared with the noninoculated controls. Lesions produced on the lower stem and taproot of the inoculated plants averaged 4.5 cm long. Most plants had mild foliar symptoms that included mottling, rugosity, and leaf cupping. Only three plants had severe foliage symptoms. F. solani f. sp. glycines was recovered from 56% of inoculated plants, completing Koch's postulates for all 11 isolates. Noninoculated controls were symptomless. Sudden death syndrome was not observed in 2001. Soybean is an important crop in the region; 250,000 ha were harvested in 2000 on the Delmarva Peninsula, which includes the three counties of Delaware, nine eastern shore counties of Maryland, and two counties of Virginia. Sudden death syndrome could be a serious threat to profitable soybean production. To our knowledge, this is the first report of sudden death syndrome from this area and represents the most eastern occurrence of this disease reported in the United States. References: (1) K. W. Roy.

1630,Endophyte composition and Cinchona alkaloid production abilities of Cinchona ledgeriana cultivated in Japan,"New eight endophytic filamentous fungi were isolated from the young stems of Cinchona ledgeriana (Rubiaceae) cultivated in Japan. They were classified into four genera based on phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2), including the 5.8S ribosomal DNA region. Of the eight fungi isolated, there were five genera Cladosporium, one Meira sp., one Diaporthe sp. and one Penicillium sp. Genus of Cladosporium and Meira were first isolated fungi from Cinchona plant. In a previous study, we applied the same process to the same plant cultivated in Indonesia. The endophyte compositions for the two cultivation regions were found to differ at the genera level. The ability of Cinchona endophytes cultivated in Japan to produce Cinchona alkaloids was also assessed. We found that three isolates have producing ability of Cinchona alkaloids. However, the amount produced was very small compared to that produced by the endophytes of Indonesian Cinchona ledgeriana. In addition, the total content amount of Cinchona alkaloids, especially quinine, produced by the extract of Cinchona cultivated in Japan was much smaller than that from Indonesia. These finding indicate that endophyte composition has an influence on the Cinchona alkaloid content amount in the Cinchona ledgeriana host.","Maehara, S; Agusta, A; Tokunaga, Y; Shibuya, H; Hata, T",JOURNAL OF NATURAL MEDICINES,2019,10.1007/s11418-018-1273-z,0.852403224555637,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.928740744374719,0.0712592556252814,0.999997783466305,2.21653369503194e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

6811,Molecular mechanism of Cu metal and drought stress resistance triggered by Porostereum spadiceum AGH786 in Solanum lycopersicum L.,"Rapid industrialization and global warming have threatened the plants with multiple abiotic stresses, such as heavy metals and drought stress. For crop cultivation, the conventional approach of cleaning the soils by excavation is very costly and not feasible for large scale. Establishing toxin-free and drought-resistant crops is a major challenge in the environment under natural and anthropogenic pressure. In the past decades, copper contamination of agricultural land has become an emerging concern. For dry land reclamation, several new strategies, including bioremediation (phytoremediation and microbial remediation), have been used. Owing to the potential of Cu hyperaccumulators, the current project aims to enhance the drought tolerance and the phytoremediation potential of Solanum lycopersicum L. with the inoculation of copper and 12% polyethylene glycol (PEG)-induced drought stress-tolerant endophytic fungus Porostereum spadiceum AGH786 under the combined stress of copper heavy metal and PEG-induced drought stress. When S. lycopersicum L. was watered with individual stress of copper (Cu) concentration (400 ppm) in the form of copper sulfate (CuSO4.5H(2)O), 12% PEG-induced drought stress and the combined stress of both negatively affected the growth attributes, hormonal, metabolic, and antioxidant potential, compared with control. However, the multistress-resistant AGH786 endophytic fungus ameliorated the multistress tolerance response in S. lycopersicum L. by positively affecting the growth attributes, hormonal, metabolic, and antioxidant potential, and by restricting the root-to-shoot translocation of Cu and inducing its sequestration in the root tissues of affected plants. AGH786-associated plants exhibited a reduction in the severity of copper (Cu) and drought stress, with higher levels of SlCOPT (Cu transporters) and SlMT (metallothionine) gene expressions in root and shoot tissues, indicating that AGH786 contributed to resistance to copper metal toxicity and drought stress in the host S. lycopersicum L.","Naz, F; Hamayun, M; Rauf, M; Arif, M; Khan, SA; Ud-Din, J; Gul, H; Hussain, A; Iqbal, A; Kim, HY; Lee, IJ",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2022,10.3389/fpls.2022.1029836,0.916965116288638,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996116307792019,0.00388369220798073,0.999999958595214,4.14047861552191e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

1816,Insights into the seed microbiome and its ecological significance in plant life,"In recent years, the microbiome has attracted much attention because of the multiple roles and functions that microbes play in plants, animals, and human beings. Seed-associated microbes are of particular interest in being the initial microbial inoculum that affects the critical early life stages of a plant. The seed-microbe interactions are also known to improve nutrient acquisition, resilience against pathogens, and resistance against abiotic stresses. Despite these diverse roles, the seed microbiome has received little attention in plant ecology. Thus, we review the current knowledge on seed microbial diversity, community structure, and functions obtained through culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive synthesis of the ecological literature on seed-microbe interactions to better understand the impact of these interactions on plant health and productivity. We suggest that future research should focus on the role of the seed microbiome in the establishment, colonization and spread of plant species in their native and non-native ranges as it may provide new insights into conservation biology and invasion ecology.","War, AF; Bashir, I; Reshi, ZA; Kardol, P; Rashid, I",MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH,2023,10.1016/j.micres.2023.127318,0.913028482758077,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999999963443693,3.65563068515248e-8,0.999128642029786,8.7135797021409e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

12357,Contamination with ergot bodies (Claviceps purpurea sensu lato) of two horse pastures in Northern Germany,"Because the occurrence of Claviceps in European pastures may have been overlooked to cause serious health problem for grazing animals, we documented the degree of Claviceps contamination in two horse pastures and estimated whether the horses could have ingested a critical quantity of alkaloids. We counted the Claviceps sclerotia and determined alkaloid levels using high performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. Depending on the location, the number of sclerotia varied from 0.09 to 0.19 per square meter (central area) and from 0.23 to 55.8 per square meter (border strips). Alkaloid levels in individual sclerotia also varied in different genera of grasses, ranging from 0.98 +/- 0.17 mu g/kg in Agrostis sp. to 25.82 +/- 9.73 mu g/kg in Dactylis sp., equivalent to 0.98 mu g/kg and 7.26 mg/kg. Sclerotia from Dactylis contained high levels of ergosine (0.209 % +/- 0.100 %) and ergocristine (0.374 % +/- 0.070 %). Depending on the localization in pastures, alkaloid levels in forage (dry matter, DM) ranged from 16.1 to 45.4 mu g/kg in central areas and from 23.9 to 722 mu g/kg in border strips. The amount of alkaloids that a horse could have ingested depended on its daily DM uptake, which was higher in the central areas (5.85 kg/day) than in the border strips (2.73 or 0.78 kg/day). In the central areas, this amount of alkaloids ranged from 94.2 to 265.9 mu g/day; and in the border strips, from 65.3 (in 2.73 kg DM/day) to as much as 563.8 mu g/day (in 0.78 kg DM/day). All these amounts are higher than the European averages for alkaloids ingested by horses via feedstuffs.","Aboling, S; Drotleff, AM; Cappai, MG; Kamphues, J",MYCOTOXIN RESEARCH,2016,10.1007/s12550-016-0253-y,0.971417365734117,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.9926679289155,0.00733207108449985,0.999999997237491,2.7625091103544702e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15119,"Characterization of heterogeneous groups of fungal endophytes isolated from mangroves in Negombo, Sri Lanka","Mangroves are well known for their adaptability to extreme conditions; thus, mangrove habitats help to manage coastlines and carbon cycling against anthropogenic stresses. Fungal endophyte is a type of microorganism that typically has a mutualistic relationship with its plant hosts. These endophytes can be found in several parts of the plant and play a positive role in the production of enzymes, nutrients and secondary metabolites, along with other processes such as toxin assembly and phyto-stimulation. The exploitation of these bioactive substances from endophytic fungi is beneficial in several fields such as pharmaceuticals and agriculture. The objective of the current investigation was to isolate and identify fungal endophytes present in ten mangrove species from Negombo, Sri Lanka: Acanthus ilicifolius, Acrostichum aureum, Avicennia marina, Bruguiera cylindrica, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Excoecaria agallocha, Lumnitzera racemosa, Rhizophora mucronata, Sonneratia alba and Sonneratia caseolaris. A standard potato dextrose agar culturing was used to obtain fungal colonies from leaves, roots and twigs, whose morphological characteristics were used for their identification. Out of the 42 fungal isolates extracted from the samples, nine endophytic genera such as Aspergillus, Candida, Chaetomium, Fusarium, Mucor, Penicillium, Phyllosticta, Rhizopus and Trichoderma were found. The highest number of isolates was obtained from Sonneratia alba. Each mangrove species held varying types of fungal colonies, with the genus Penicillium being isolated the highest number of times and the genus Aspergillus being highly diverse. The findings of this study have helped to confirm the presence of endophytic fungi in all the sample mangroves tested. © 2023, MRF.

4256,"Molecular phylogenetic biodiversity assessment of arctic and boreal ectomycorrhizal Lactarius Pers. (Russulales; Basidiomycota) in Alaska, based on soil and sporocarp DNA","Despite the critical roles fungi play in the functioning of ecosystems, especially as symbionts of plants and recyclers of organic matter, their biodiversity is poorly known in high-latitude regions. In this paper, we discuss the molecular diversity of one of the most diverse and abundant groups of ectomycorrhizal fungi: the genus Lactarius Pers. We analysed internal transcribed spacer rDNA sequences from both curated sporocarp collections and soil polymerase chain reaction clone libraries sampled in the arctic tundra and boreal forests of Alaska. Our genetic diversity assessment, based on various phylogenetic methods and operational taxonomic unit (OTU) delimitations, suggests that the genus Lactarius is diverse in Alaska, with at least 43 putative phylogroups, and 24 and 38 distinct OTUs based on 95% and 97% internal transcribed spacer sequence similarity, respectively. Some OTUs were identified to known species, while others were novel, previously unsequenced groups. Non-asymptotic species accumulation curves, the disparity between observed and estimated richness, and the high number of singleton OTUs indicated that many Lactarius species remain to be found and identified in Alaska. Many Lactarius taxa show strong habitat preference to one of the three major vegetation types in the sampled regions (arctic tundra, black spruce forests, and mixed birch-aspen-white spruce forests), as supported by statistical tests of UniFrac distances and principal coordinates analyses (PCoA). Together, our data robustly demonstrate great diversity and nonrandom ecological partitioning in an important boreal ectomycorrhizal genus within a relatively small geographical region. The observed diversity of Lactarius was much higher in either type of boreal forest than in the arctic tundra, supporting the widely recognized pattern of decreasing species richness with increasing latitude.","Geml, J; Laursen, GA; Timling, I; Mcfarland, JM; Booth, MG; Lennon, N; Nusbaum, C; Taylor, DL",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2009,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2009.04192.x,0.951386356373068,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999832444667922,1.6755533207793e-4,0.999999999507231,4.92768714721592e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

We sampled plants from two wheat cultivars, Apache and Caphorn, showing different levels of susceptibility to Fusarium head blight, a major disease of wheat, and tested for variation in microbial diversity and assemblages depending on the host cultivar, host organ (aerial organs vs. roots) or host maturity. Fungi and bacteria were isolated using a culture dependent method. Isolates were identified using ribosomal DNA sequencing and we used diversity analysis to study the community composition of microorganisms over space and time. Results indicate great species diversity in wheat, with endophytes and pathogens co-occurring inside plant tissues. Significant differences in microbial communities were observed according to host maturity and host organs but we did not find clear differences between host cultivars. Some species isolated have not yet been reported as wheat endophytes and among all species recovered some might be good candidates as biological control agents, given their known effects toward plant pathogens.","Comby, M; Lacoste, S; Baillieul, F; Profizi, C; Dupont, J",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2016,10.3389/fmicb.2016.00403,0.722671217496781,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999192633378935,8.0736662106517e-4,0.999998788281908,1.21171809219778e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

Through culture and molecular identification, 35 strains, belonging to 15 genera, 12 families, 10 orders, 4 classes, and 2 phyla, were isolated from various tissues of Z. nitidum, of which Colletotrichum and Fusarium were the dominant genera, respectively accounting for 20% of total strains. The diversity of endophytic fungi was significantly different among roots, stems, and leaves, as manifested by the significantly higher Shannon index (H') in stems (1.678) than in roots (0.882 1) and leaves (0.515 4). The antimicrobial activity analysis showed that 14.28% of endophytic fungi inhibited at least one indicator pathogen. Among them, Fusarium sp. ZN-34 and Fusarium sp. ZN-26 separately demonstrated the strongest inhibitory effect on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. In general, Fusarium sp. ZN-26 and Phialemoniopsis plurioloculosa ZN-35 were advantageous in suppressing the two bacteria owing to the broad spectrum and strong efficacy. In summary, Z. nitidum in Guangxi boasts rich endophytic fungi with the majority showing strong antibacterial activity, which can be used as candidates for the extraction and separation of basic antibacterial substances and the development of natural antibacterial agents. © 2021, Editorial Board of China Journal of Chinese Materia Medica.

11168,Influence of seed treatment on microbiota and development of winter wheat seedlings,"The microbiota of winter wheat seeds from the North-East of Ukraine was studied by a biological method. Its considerable variability is established over three years (2017-2019). The effect of the treatment agents on most microorganisms of wheat seed microbiota in Ukraine, rather than on its genera and species, is shown. It has been proven that fungicides deleted some species and did not affect the development of others. Chemicals replaced some species or genera of fungi with others or even other microorganisms. Biological seed treatment (Phytosporin-M) has caused less microbiota change than chemical treatment (Maxim 0.25 FS, Rostock, Kinto Duo). Fungicides have replaced the dominance of Alternaria spp. (2017 - 57.8%, 2018 - 63.5%) for the dominance of yeast (Rostock - 54%) and Aureobasidium pullulans (Maxim 0.25 FS - 84.2%) in 2017, bacteria (Maxim 0.25 FS - 72.3%, Rostock - 53.8%) - in 2018. A. pullulans dominated in the microbiota of winter wheat seeds in 2019. The highest amount of A. pullulans was noted for the treatment of seeds by Phytosporin-M (85.9%). The biological seed treatment reduced the amount of Nigrospora spp. and Alternaria spp. Several times (3 and 5, respectively), chemical agents did not give Nigrospora spp. germination reduced the amount of A. pullulans, Alternaria spp. in 2019. Maxim 0.25 FS, Rostock 50%, and Kinto Duo delayed seed germination and seedling development on agar medium and soil, whereas Phytosporin-M - on the contrary, promoted the growth of seedlings and significantly exceeded control.","Rozhkova, TO; Burdulanyuk, AO; Bakumenko, OM; Yemets, OM; Vlasenko, VA; Tatarynova, VI; Demenko, VM; Osmachko, OM; Polozhenets, VM; Nemerytska, LV; Zhuravska, IA; Matsyura, AV; Stankevych, SV",UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2021,10.15421/2021_8,0.925988922405487,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.988370695338291,0.0116293046617086,0.999999926969393,7.30306070062525e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

This study was undertaken to isolate, identify and evaluate antimicrobial activity of endophytic fungi from Rafflesia cantleyi, a Malaysian endemic species. Different parts of the flower and bud collected in Perak, Malaysia, were surface sterilized and plated onto potato dextrose agar. Fungal isolates recovered were cultured in potato dextrose broth for antimicrobial activity screening and solvent extraction. Fungal 5.8S gene and flanking internal transcribed spacer regions of rDNA were sequenced for construction of phylogenetic trees. Eight endophytic strains obtained from R. cantleyi were categorized as seven morphotypes. Three isolates inhibited the growth of Candida albicans with IC50 values of 3.5-8.2 mu g/ml for crude fungal extracts.

We investigated the effect gall formation has on fungal endophyte communities and diversity. Using three closely-related gall-forming aphid species that specialize on poplars, we characterized fungal endophyte diversity in galls and surrounding petiole and leaf lamina tissue. A total of 516 fungal endophyte samples were isolated from 272 tissue samples (32 leaves, 31 petioles, and 209 galls), resulting in 23 distinct morphotypes. Despite sharing a common host plant and often forming spatially contiguous galls, the endophyte profiles within the galls of each aphid species were distinct, not only from the galls of the other species, but also from surrounding plant tissue. These results suggest that insect galls can affect the composition of fungal endophyte species in plant tissues, by altering either the colonization or proliferation of their endophytic mycobiota. Likewise, fungal endophytes may be important in the ecology and evolution of insect galls.","Lawson, SP; Christian, N; Abbot, P",FUNGAL DIVERSITY,2014,10.1007/s13225-013-0268-z,0.854049585319692,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.933084101630595,0.0669158983694052,0.999994583248692,5.41675130782959e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Most seeds are contaminated with a variety of bacteria and fungi, and those microbes are usually limited to the seed surface. Heat treatments are not effective for seed disinfection because the high temperatures needed to effectively reduce microbial contamination also reduce seed germination.

1989,Divergence of a genomic island leads to the evolution of melanization in a halophyte root fungus,"Understanding how organisms adapt to extreme living conditions is central to evolutionary biology. Dark septate endophytes (DSEs) constitute an important component of the root mycobiome and they are often able to alleviate host abiotic stresses. Here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial association between the DSE Laburnicola rhizohalophila and its host, the native halophyte Suaeda salsa, using population genomics. Based on genome-wide Fst (pairwise fixation index) and Vst analyses, which compared the variance in allele frequencies of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and copy number variants (CNVs), respectively, we found a high level of genetic differentiation between two populations. CNV patterns revealed population-specific expansions and contractions. Interestingly, we identified a similar to 20 kbp genomic island of high divergence with a strong sign of positive selection. This region contains a melanin-biosynthetic polyketide synthase gene cluster linked to six additional genes likely involved in biosynthesis, membrane trafficking, regulation, and localization of melanin. Differences in growth yield and melanin biosynthesis between the two populations grown under 2% NaCl stress suggested that this genomic island contributes to the observed differences in melanin accumulation.

4648,The Interaction between Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi and Endophytic Bacteria Enhances Plant Growth of Acacia gerrardii under Salt Stress,"Microbes living symbiotically in plant tissues mutually cooperate with each other by providing nutrients for proliferation of the partner organism and have a beneficial effect on plant growth. However, few studies thus far have examined the interactive effect of endophytic bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in hostile conditions and their potential to improve plant stress tolerance. In this study, we investigated how the synergistic interactions of endophytic bacteria and AMF affect plant growth, nodulation, nutrient acquisition and stress tolerance of Acacia gerrardii under salt stress. Plant growth varied between the treatments with both single inoculants and was higher in plants inoculated with the endophytic B. subtilis strain than with AMF. Co-inoculated A. gerrardii had a significantly greater shoot and root dry weight, nodule number, and leghemoglobin content than those inoculated with AMF or B. subtilis alone under salt stress. The endophytic B. subtilis could alleviate the adverse effect of salt on AMF colonization. The differences in nitrate and nitrite reductase and nitrogenase activities between uninoculated plants and those inoculated with AMF and B. subtilis together under stress were significant. Both inoculation treatments, either B. subtilis alone or combined with AMF, enhanced the N, P, K, Mg, and Ca contents and phosphatase activities in salt-stressed A. gerrardii tissues and reduced Na and CI concentration, thereby protecting salt-stressed plants from ionic and osmotic stress-induced changes. In conclusion, our results indicate that endophytic bacteria and AMF contribute to a tripartite mutualistic symbiosis in A. gerrardii and are coordinately involved in the plant adaptation to salt stress tolerance.","Hashem, A; Abd Allah, EF; Alqarawi, AA; Ai-Huqail, AA; Wirth, S; Egamberdieva, D",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2016,10.3389/fmicb.2016.01089,0.964623091415963,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.925700229556067,0.0742997704439326,0.999999433264458,5.66735542495422e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The present study focused on the molecular phylogenetics of the endophytic fungus that associated with the leaf of Kayea assamica, an endemic plant species of Northeast India and identification of its secondary metabolites (natural product) that produced under in vitro condition. The endogenous fungus was isolated from the sterile disease-free leaf segment (similar to 1 cm), followed by PCR amplification of ITS region using the extracted genomic DNA as a template. Further, the crude methanol extract of the fungal culture was subjected to Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. The molecular phylogenetic analysis confirmed the fungal isolate as Beltraniella species (endophyte). The ITS sequence was submitted to GenBank database (Id MH295767.1). The GC-MS analysis revealed eleven different secondary metabolites at different retention times. Many of these compounds have been reported to be plant & endophytic metabolite, essential oil component, recognized fragrant molecule, antimicrobial, antioxidant, anticancer activities etc. The findings projected that the endophyte may have a significant role in the host-defense mechanism. Tetrapentacontane is a part of fragrant molecules found in juvenile agarwood shown highest abundance (54.63%) at 21.477 RT followed by the others.

1362,Differences in endophyte communities of introduced trees depend on the phylogenetic relatedness of the receiving forest,"Plant species sometimes perform extraordinarily well when introduced to new environments, through achieving higher growth rates, individual biomasses or higher densities in their receiving communities compared to their native range communities. One hypothesis proposed to explain enhanced performance in species' new environments is that their soil microbial communities may be different and provide greater benefit than microbial communities encountered in species' native environments. However, detailed descriptions of soil biota associated with species in both their native and introduced environments remain scarce. We established a global network of sites in regions where the tree species Pinus contorta has been introduced (Chile, New Zealand, Finland, Scotland and Sweden), as well as native range sites where the introduced populations originated (Canada and USA). We conducted pyrosequencing analysis to compare the root fungal endophyte communities associated with P.contorta in its native environments and in introduced environments with phylogenetically similar and dissimilar tree species (i.e. P.sylvestris in Europe and Nothofagus spp. in the Southern Hemisphere). Fungal communities associated with P.contorta consistently differed between its introduced and native environments. In Europe, P.contorta associated with the same community as P.sylvestris, where one particular species (Piloderma sphaerosporum) was particularly abundant relative to Canadian sites. In the Southern Hemisphere, P.contorta fungal communities were composed primarily of North American taxa and exhibited very little overlap with fungal communities associated with native Nothofagus spp.Synthesis. Our work shows that plants exhibit considerable plasticity in their interaction with fungi, by associating with different fungal communities across native and introduced environments. Our work also indicates that fungal communities associated with introduced plants can assemble through different mechanisms, that is by associating with existing fungal communities of phylogenetically close species, or through reassembly of co-introduced and co-invading fungi. The identification of different fungal communities in a plant species new environment provides an important step forward in understanding how soil biota may impact growth and invasion when a species is introduced to new environments.","Gundale, MJ; Almeida, JP; Wallander, H; Wardle, DA; Kardol, P; Nilsson, MC; Fajardo, A; Pauchard, A; Peltzer, DA; Ruotsalainen, S; Mason, B; Rosenstock, N",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2016,10.1111/1365-2745.12595,0.878560205553843,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999972993667548,2.70063324516871e-5,0.999999988919986,1.1080014017395e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
14991,Plant Growth Promoting Efficacy of Endophytic Fungi Isolated from the Terrestrial Plants of North India,"Enhanced crop health, which is crucial for sustainable agriculture, is facilitated by a unique endophyte or endophytic community that is frequently linked to a variety of crops. Plant growth-promoting (PGP) characteristics of endophytes can directly or indirectly boost crop growth. Endophytic fungi have been proven to create a high percentage of new compounds, making them a particularly potential source of physiologically active chemicals. In this study, we have isolated two endophytic isolates, i.e., Paecilomyces sp. (Isolate AT1) and Aspergillus flavus (Isolate AT3), from different host plants, namely Melaleuca citrine and Carica papaya. These endophytes have shown significant plant growth-promoting potential toward different assays such as IAA production, phosphate solubilization, amylase production, cellulose-degrading assay, and ammonia production. These endophytic fungi also exhibit visible antimicrobial action towards selected crop pathogenic fungi (Aspergillus sp. and Penicillium sp.). Additionally, these fungal strains are reported for the first time from these plants, as we have found no reports in the literature. The research aims to explore the growth-promoting efficacy of endophytic fungi to boost plant growth. © 2023 Technoscience Publications.

5683,Occurrence of Pestalotiopsis sp. on Ornamental Plants Camellia japonica L. in Romanian Public Gardens,"Camellias are evergreen shrubs native to the eastern and southern regions of Asia. In Romania, camellias are popular ornamental plants grown in pots. Pestalotiopsis species have a worldwide distribution and are pathogenic to a wide range of hosts. They also represent an important group of endophytes capable of producing a variety of bioactive secondary metabolites. This paper reports the occurrence of grey blight and twig or branch dieback caused by Pestalotiopsis sp. on Camellia japonica L. grown in pots and used in the landscaping of a public garden located in Iasi city, Romania (GPS coordinates: 47 degrees 09 ' 24.0 '' N 27 degrees 35 ' 15.6 '' E). Pestalotiopsis species were identified based on morphological characteristics and Sanger sequencing. Genomic analysis of the fungal isolate coded P_CJ_24, obtained from living plants, was based on ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region amplification using the LSU primers. This first report of Pestalotiopsis species infection of ornamental plants in Romania suggests that new plant pathogens can be introduced in new environmental conditions through plant pods and their incidence increases with the widespread of plant material among gardens.","Florea, AM; Gafencu, AM; Lipsa, FD; Gabur, I; Ulea, E",HORTICULTURAE,2025,10.3390/horticulturae11010093,0.832482881587881,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99999182620049,8.17379951019642e-6,0.999999999493744,5.06255815047041e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

13976,"Colonization investigation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) in roots of Polygonatum kingianum and their correlations with content of main functional components in rhizomes; [不同产地滇黄精丛枝菌根真菌, 深色有隔内生真菌定殖调查及与主要功效成分含量相关性分析]","Objective: To investigate the colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) in the roots of Polygonatum kingianum planted at different areas, and explore the correlations between the colonization rate and the main functional components. Methods: Fresh roots of P. kingianum from five plots in Yunnan Province were taken as research objects. The alkali dissociation method was used to investigate the colonization of AMF and DSE in the roots of P. kingianum. Then the morphological structure was photographed. The content of P. sibiricum polysaccharides, diosgenin, total flavonoids and extractum were separately determined by phonel-sulfate method, colorimetry method of vanillin-acetic acid-perchloric acid, spectrophotometry method with rutin standard and hot dipping method with alcohol. The correlations between the colonization rates of AMF or DSE and four main functional components were analyzed by Pearson correlation coefficient method. Results: The average colonization of AMF and DSE in the five plots were 26.25%-57.54% and 31.67%-45.19%, respectively. The colonization rates of AMF and DSE from HHMZ was higher than the other four others. All of correlations among the colonization rates of AMF, DSE and their typical structure and the four main functional components in the rhizomes were positive correlation, in which the correlations between the content of polysaccharides, diosgenin or total flavonoids and the colonization rates of AMF or DSE were higher, and their correlation coefficient were respectively 0.838/0.887, 0.819/0.703, and 0.785/0.855 (AMF/DSE). Furthermore, the correlations between the content of polysaccharides and the colonization rates of AMF hypha or DSE were significant. In addition, there were high correlations among the colonization rates of AMF, DSE and their typical structures, as well as the content in pairs of four functional components. Conclusion: There were higher colonization rates of AMF and DSE in the fibrous roots of P. kingianum. The correlations between the colonization rates of AMF or DSE and each main functional component were positive. This study provides data support and experimental basis for the implementation of ecological planting of P. kingianum and the use of biological means to increase production and income.rates © 2019, Editorial Office of Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs.

21090,"Isolation, purification and characterization of serine protease inhibitor producing endophytic fungus Penicillium chrysogenum sp. AZX2011","The endophytic fungus Penicillium chrysogenum sp. AZX2011 was isolated from the medicinal plant Lawsonia inermis. The phylogenetic study of isolated fungus was carried out by 18s rRNA analysis. The partial sequence of 18s rRNA was submitted to the Gen bank database which allotted accession number KU253718.1. This fungal species produces a strong serine protease inhibitor (SPI) which showed inhibition against trypsin as a model enzyme. Purity of purified SPI was confirmed by SDSPAGE (Sodium Dodecyl Sulphate-Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and MALDI-TOF (Matrixassisted laser ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometer) with molecular weight 18.5 kDa. Serine protease inhibitor (SPI) was found to be stable from pH 4.0 to pH 10.0 and temperature 25°C to 60°C. However, this trypsin inhibitor did not show any anti-protease activity against other proteases like papain, metallo-proteases and pepsin. © 2017 Copyright International Knowledge Press.

18433,Marine Algicolous Endophytic Fungi - A Promising Drug Resource of the Era.,"Endophytic fungi have currently been acknowledged as the most promising source of bioactive compounds for drug discovery, and considerable progress has been made in exploring their diversity, species richness, and bioprospecting. Fungal endophytes from unique environmental settings offer a pool of potentially useful medicinal entities. Owing to the constant stresses imposed on macroalgae by marine environments, it is believed that algae and their associated endophytic symbionts represent a good source of structurally diverse bioactive secondary metabolites. Despite the proven significance of active metabolites of algal endophytes, little have been exploited. This review highlights the latest discoveries in algicolous endophytic research, with particular focus on the bioactive metabolites from algal endophytes. Compounds are classified according to their reported biological activities, like anticancer, antibacterial, antifungal, and antioxidant properties. Present experimental evidence suggests that a majority of the bioactive metabolites were reported from Phaeophyceae followed by Rhodophyceae and Chlorophyceae. An intensive search for newer and more effective bioactive metabolites has generated a treasure trove of publications, and this review partially covers the literature published up to 2016.",Sarasan M; Puthumana J; Job N; Han J; Lee JS; Philip R,Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,2017,10.4014/jmb.1701.01036,0.910875461717179,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.987793744931209,0.0122062550687905,0.99999985567299,1.44327009676815e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

16533,Broccoli Raab as a Host of Alternaria brassicae in California.,"In the fall of 1996, commercial plantings of broccoli raab or rappini (Brassica rapa subsp. rapa) in the Salinas Valley, Monterey County, were damaged by a disease previously unreported in California. Symptoms consisted of small (7 to 8 mm in diameter), circular to oblong, brown to light tan leaf spots that contained characteristic concentric rings. An Alternaria sp. having conidia with prominent beaks and spores produced singly or in chains of two was consistently observed on and isolated from the host. Conidia from naturally infected broccoli raab measured 144.5 to 194.5 × 22.2 to 30.6 μm (beak length ranged from 33.3 to 75.0 μm). The isolates were identified as Alternaria brassicae (Berk.) Sacc. (2). Pathogenicity was confirmed by culturing five representative isolates on sterilized 20% V8 juice solution for 10 days under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, filtering the suspensions through cheesecloth, obtaining spore concentrations of 30,000 conidia per ml, and spraying suspensions onto 6-week-old seedlings of broccoli raab cv. Spring Raab. Plants were incubated in a humid chamber for 48 h and then maintained in a greenhouse. After 5 to 7 days, leaf spots similar to the original symptoms developed on all inoculated plants. The pathogen was reisolated and identified as A. brassicae. Control plants sprayed with distilled water remained symptomless. The inoculation test was repeated and results were the same. Because of the extensive plantings of cole crops in the Salinas Valley, isolates from broccoli raab were inoculated onto two sets each of broccoli (Brassica oleracea subsp. italica cv. Greenbelt), Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris subsp. pekinensis cv. Cha-Cha), and Japanese mustard (Brassica campestris subsp. nipposinica cv. Mizuna), using the method described above. After 5 to 7 days, similar leaf spots developed on all inoculated plants and A. brassicae was reisolated and identified. Control plants sprayed with distilled water remained symptomless. This fungus does not appear to be a pathogen specific to particular cole crops in this area (1). For California, this is the first report of black spot caused by A. brassicae on commercially grown broccoli raab. References: (1) S. T. Koike. Plant Dis. 80:822, 1996. (2) E. G. Simmons.

1063,"Deception Island, Antarctica, harbors a diverse assemblage of wood decay fungi","Very little is known about fungal diversity in Antarctica as compared to other biomes and how these important organisms function in this unusual ecosystem. Perhaps one of the most unusual ecosystems is that of Deception Island; an active volcanic island part of the South Shetland Islands of the Antarctic Peninsula. Here we describe the fungal diversity associated with historic wood from structures on the island, which reveals a diverse fungal assemblage of known wood decay fungi as well as the discovery of undescribed species. The major group of wood decay fungi identified were species of Cadophora and as shown in previous studies in other geographic regions of Antarctica, they caused a soft rot type of decay in the introduced woods. Additionally, unlike other areas of Antarctica that have been studied, filamentous basidiomycetes (Hypochniciellum spp. and Pholiota spp.) were also identified that have different modes of degradation including brown and white rot. Matches of fungal sequences to known species in temperate regions likely introduced on building materials indicates human influences and volcanic activity have greatly impacted fungal diversity. Lahars (mudslides from volcanic activity) have partially buried many of the structures and the buried environment as well as the moist, warm soils provided conditions conducive for fungal growth that are not found in other regions of Antarctica. The diverse assemblage of decay fungi and different forms of wood decomposition add to the difficulty of conserving wooden structures at these important polar heritage sites.

13153,Climate change effects on beneficial plant-microorganism interactions,"It is well known that beneficial plant-associated microorganisms may stimulate plant growth and enhance resistance to disease and abiotic stresses. The effects of climate change factors such as elevated CO2, drought and warming on beneficial plant-microorganism interactions are increasingly being explored. This now makes it possible to test whether some general patterns occur and whether different groups of plant-associated microorganisms respond differently or in the same way to climate change. Here, we review the results of 135 studies investigating the effects of climate change factors on beneficial microorganisms and their interaction with host plants. The majority of studies showed that elevated CO2 had a positive influence on the abundance of arbuscular and ectomycorrhizal fungi, whereas the effects on plant growth-promoting bacteria and endophytic fungi were more variable. In most cases, plant-associated microorganisms had a beneficial effect on plants under elevated CO2. The effects of increased temperature on beneficial plant-associated microorganisms were more variable, positive and neutral, and negative effects were equally common and varied considerably with the study system and the temperature range investigated. Moreover, numerous studies indicated that plant growth-promoting microorganisms (both bacteria and fungi) positively affected plants subjected to drought stress. Overall, this review shows that plant-associated microorganisms are an important factor influencing the response of plants to climate change. © 2010 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Four sampling sites were selected; one of which was sampled twice, in spring and autumn. About 3892 fungal isolates obtained grouped into 85 morphological types. The 11 dominant species, with isolation frequencies > 1.5%, were Alternaria alternata, Botryosphaeria sarmentorum, Colletotrichum dematium, C. gloeosporioides, Hendersonula sp., Paraconiothyrium sp., Phoma sp., three species of Phomopsis and Seimatosporium lichenicola. Numbers of fungal species isolated per tree differed between the sampled sites. Isolation frequencies of the dominant species, and other less frequent species, were dependent on the sampling site. The degree of endophytic infection and the diversity of fungal species were significantly higher in spring. Frequencies of all dominant species depended significantly on season, except for Stemphylium sp. and S. lichenicola. Analysis of the total endophytic mycoflora of the sampled trees suggested that geographical factors affects the endophytic distribution patterns more significantly than seasonal factors.","Göre, ME; Bucak, C",FOREST PATHOLOGY,2007,10.1111/j.1439-0329.2007.00509.x,0.953866848539854,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996528621065705,0.00347137893429491,0.999999744420486,2.55579513774862e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6780,Endophytic Fungal Consortia Enhance Basal Drought-Tolerance in Moringa oleifera by Upregulating the Antioxidant Enzyme (APX) through Heat Shock Factors,"Global climate change has imposed harsh environmental conditions such as drought. Naturally, the most compatible fungal consortia operate synergistically to enhance plant growth and ecophysiological responses against abiotic strains. Yet, little is known about the interactions between phytohormone-producing endophytic fungal symbionts and plant growth under drought stress. The existing research was rationalized to recognize the role of newly isolated drought-resistant, antioxidant-rich endophytic fungal consortia hosting a xerophytic plant, Carthamus oxycantha L., inoculated to Moringa oleifera L. grown under drought stress of 8% PEG (polyethylene glycol-8000). Under drought stress, the combined inoculation of endophytic strain Microdochium majus (WA), Meyerozyma guilliermondi (TG), and Aspergillus aculeatus (TL3) exhibited a significant improvement in growth attributes such as shoot fresh weight (1.71-fold), shoot length (0.86-fold), root length (0.65-fold), dry weight (2.18-fold), total chlorophyll (0.46-fold), and carotenoids (0.87-fold) in comparison to control (8% PEG). Primary and secondary metabolites were also increased in M. oleifera inoculated with endophytic consortia, under drought stress, such as proteins (1.3-fold), sugars (0.58-fold), lipids (0.41-fold), phenols (0.36-fold), flavonoids (0.52-fold), proline (0.6-fold), indole acetic acid (IAA) (4.5-fold), gibberellic acid (GA) (0.7-fold), salicylic acid (SA) (0.8-fold), ascorbic acid (ASA) (1.85-fold), while abscisic acid (ABA) level was decreased (-0.61-fold) in comparison to the control (8% PEG). Under drought stress, combined inoculation (WA, TG, TL3) also promoted the antioxidant activities of enzymes such as ascorbate peroxidase (APX) (3.5-fold), catalase (CAT) activity (1.7-fold), and increased the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (0.78-fold) with reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2 production (-0.4-fold), compared to control (8% PEG), and stomatal aperture was larger (3.5-fold) with a lesser decrease (-0.02-fold) in water potential. Moreover, combined inoculation (WA, TG, TL3) up regulated the expression of MolHSF3, MolHSF19, and MolAPX genes in M. oleifera under drought stress, compared to the control (8% PEG), is suggestive of an important regulatory role for drought stress tolerance governed by fungal endophytes. The current research supports the exploitation of the compatible endophytic fungi for establishing the tripartite mutualistic symbiosis in M. oleifera to alleviate the adverse effects of drought stress through strong antioxidant activities.","Javed, J; Rauf, M; Arif, M; Hamayun, M; Gul, H; Ud-Din, A; Ud-Din, J; Sohail, M; Rahman, MM; Lee, IJ",ANTIOXIDANTS,2022,10.3390/antiox11091669,0.949078786954624,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.91437507948697,0.0856249205130297,0.999999996704768,3.29523175413016e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

A few studies substantiate this novel approach of pest management; however, since this facet of endophyte research is nascent, enquiries answering basic questions on various aspects of endophyte biology are essential to successfully implement endophyte-mediated biocontrol. In a collaborative research, we addressed a few of these questions including (i) to what extent do fungal genera reported to have entomopathogenic species colonize non-crops as endophytes? (ii) can an endophyte from a non-crop source and vested with anti-insect property survive as an endophyte when introduced into a crop? (iii) how does an anti-insect endophyte in a crop affect an insect pest? and (iv) can endophytes be used for controlling weeds? The results of this study show that endophytes have enormous potential as biocontrol agents and reiterate the need for concerted efforts to obtain more basic information about endophyte biology before they can be used effectively for biocontrol. Methods: Non-entomopathogenic but anti-insect metabolites producing endophytes from plant and non-plant sources are shown to have potential biocontrol properties. Survival of an effective fungus from an alien source in a crop plant as an endophyte has been shown to be only for a limited period. Endophytes are shown to possess weedicidal activity. Results: Entomopathogenic fungal genera rarely colonize leaves of forest trees as foliar endophytes. Non-entomogenous endophytes produce ant-insect compounds affecting pests of crops thus having the potential as biocontrol agents. Such fungi isolated from non-plant sources can be inoculated into crops to function as endophytes, for brief periods. Insect pests avoid crops with anti-insect endophytes for oviposition and feeding. Some endophytes elaborate weedicidal compounds. Conclusion: Our basic study underscores the need to screen plants and non-plants of different habitats for entomopathogenic and anti-insect endosymbiotic fungi. Futhermore, it highlights the importance of screening endophytes for weedicidal compounds. We emphasise the need for focused studies for better understanding of the interaction between endophytes and their plant hosts and the biotic stressors of the host plants to enhance the success of using endophytes for biological control. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.",Suryanarayanan T.S.; Govinda Rajulu M.B.; Vidal S.,Current Biotechnology,2016,10.2174/2211550105666160504130322,0.939316553068179,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998554423736957,0.00144557626304295,0.999999868772999,1.31227000710332e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12230,Fungal elicitors combined with a sucrose feed significantly enhance triterpene production of a Salvia fruticosa cell suspension,"Oleanolic (OA) and ursolic acid (UA) are plant secondary metabolites with diverse pharmacological properties. To reach reasonable productivities with plant cell suspension cultures, elicitation is a widely used strategy. Within the presented work, the effects of different elicitors on growth and production of OA and UA in a Salvia fruticosa cell suspension culture were examined. Beside commonly used elicitors like jasmonic acid (JA) and yeast extract, the influence of medium filtrates of the endophytic fungi Aspergillus niger and Trichoderma virens was investigated. The best eliciting effects were achieved with JA and fungal medium filtrates. Both increased the triterpene content by approximately 70 %. Since JA showed significant growth inhibition, the volumetric triterpene yield did not increase. But, adding fungal filtrates increased the volumetric triterpene yield by approximately 70 % to 32.6 mg(OA) l(-1) and 65.9 mg(UA) l(-1) for T. virens compared to the control with 19.4 mg(OA) l(-1) and 33.3 mg(UA) l(-1). An elicitation strategy combining fungal medium filtrate of T. virens with sucrose feeding significantly enhanced cell dry weight concentration to 22.2 g l(-1) as well as triterpene content by approximately 140 %. In total, this led to an approximately 500 % increase of volumetric triterpene yield referring to the control with final values of 112.9 mg(OA) l(-1) and 210.4 mg(UA) l(-1). Despite the doubled cultivation duration, productivities of 6.7 mg(OA) l(-1) day(-1) and 12.4 mg(UA) l(-1) day(-1) were reached. These results demonstrate methods by which increased productivities of triterpenes can be achieved to attain yields competing with intact plants.","Kümmritz, S; Louis, M; Haas, C; Oehmichen, F; Gantz, S; Delenk, H; Steudler, S; Bley, T; Steingroewer, J",APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,2016,10.1007/s00253-016-7432-9,0.960604292393185,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.87507722170501,0.12492277829499,0.999944431124077,5.55688759228401e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
2292,Genetic Compatibility Determines Endophyte-Grass Combinations,"Even highly mutually beneficial microbial-plant interactions, such as mycorrhizal- and rhizobial-plant exchanges, involve selfishness, cheating and power-struggles between the partners, which depending on prevailing selective pressures, lead to a continuum of interactions from antagonistic to mutualistic. Using manipulated grass-endophyte combinations in a five year common garden experiment, we show that grass genotypes and genetic mismatches constrain genetic combinations between the vertically (via host seeds) transmitted endophytes and the out-crossing host, thereby reducing infections in established grass populations. Infections were lost in both grass tillers and seedlings in F-1 and F-2 generations, respectively. Experimental plants were collected as seeds from two different environments, i.e., meadows and nearby riverbanks. Endophyte-related benefits to the host included an increased number of inflorescences, but only in meadow plants and not until the last growing season of the experiment. Our results illustrate the importance of genetic host specificity and transgenerational maternal effects on the genetic structure of a host population, which act as destabilizing forces in endophyte-grass symbioses. We propose that (1) genetic mismatches may act as a buffering mechanism against highly competitive endophyte-grass genotype combinations threatening the biodiversity of grassland communities and (2) these mismatches should be acknowledged, particularly in breeding programmes aimed at harnessing systemic and heritable endophytes to improve the agriculturally valuable characteristics of cultivars.","Saikkonen, K; Wäli, PR; Helander, M",PLOS ONE,2010,10.1371/journal.pone.0011395,0.98440487125241,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99961314452262,3.8685547738046e-4,0.999999711781899,2.88218100719106e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

3373,"The response of two Glomus mycorrhizal fungi and a fine endophyte to elevated atmospheric CO2, soil warming and drought","Plantago lanceolata plants were grown under various environmental conditions in association with the mycorrhizal fungi Glomus mosseae, G. caledonium and a fine endophyte either individually or all together. Using a time-course approach, we investigated the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO(2)), soil warming and drought and their interactions on root length colonized (RLC) by mycorrhizal fungi and extraradical mycorrhizal hyphal (EMH) production. Plant growth responded as would be expected to the environmental manipulations. There was no plant growth-independent effect of eCO(2) on mycorrhizal colonization; however, EMH production was stimulated by eCO(2), i.e. there was increased partitioning of below-ground carbon to the EMH. Soil warming directly stimulated both percent RLC by the Glomus species and EMH density; soil warming did not affect RLC by the fine endophyte. Drought decreased percent RLC for the fine endophyte, but not for the Glomus species. The presence of one mycorrhizal fungus did not affect the response of another to the environmental variables. There was no evidence of any interactive effects of the environmental variables on RLC, but there were significant environmental interactions on EMH production. In particular, the stimulatory effects of eCO(2) and soil warming on EMH density were not additive. The results are discussed in terms of the soil carbon cycle, highlighting some crucial gaps in our knowledge. If future environmental changes affect mycorrhizal fungal turnover and respiration, then this could have important implications for the terrestrial carbon cycle.","Staddon, PL; Gregersen, R; Jakobsen, I",GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY,2004,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2004.00861.x,0.523070060066196,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999999696599159,3.03400840880906e-7,0.999999997987221,2.01277894351648e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
5772,Cladosporium species causing leaf spot on silage maize based on multi-locus phylogeny in China,"Qinghai Province is one of China's five major pastoral areas located in the northeastern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and animal husbandry plays a great part in the local economy. One of the most important crops in Qinghai Province is maize for silage, which sustains ecological animal husbandry. However, the leaf spot disease of maize has seriously impeded the healthy development of the maize industry. We found that from 2019 to 2020 leaf spot of silage maize caused by Cladosporium was a common disease in Qinghai Province. This leaf spot disease formed water-soaked round or irregular spots at the early stage and gradually expanded to black at the later stage, and the incidence of the leaf spot in the fields reached 15%-45%. In this study, 125 isolates were isolated from seven locations in Qinghai Province, with 123 isolated from leaves and two isolated from bracts of maize for silage. Their phylogeny, morphology, and pathogenicity were analysed to identify pathogens and investigate the differences among them. Based on phylogenetic analysis of multi-locus (ITS, actin, and translation elongation factor (1-alpha)) sequences and morphology characteristics, the 125 isolates were identified to belong to eight species of Cladosporium: C. allicinum, C. cladosporioides, C. xylophilum, C. herbarum, C. macrocarpum, C. asperulatum, C. subinflatum, and C. floccosum. Pathogenicity tests by artificial inoculation demonstrated that 125 isolates were pathogenic on eight maize cultivars for silage, and pathogenicity differentiation was not observed. Taken together, our results demonstrated that these eight species of Cladosporium caused leaf spot disease of maize in Qinghai Province. This is the first analysis report on Cladosporium species from maize in China, and our findings provide a theoretical foundation for the management of this disease in the future.","Qi, HX; Lu, GX; Li, ZR; Xu, CT; Tian, F; He, CB; Ma, GH; Ma, WL; Ma, HX",JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY,2023,10.1111/jph.13155,0.937658122573364,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985109650732572,0.014890349267428,0.999999995093271,4.90672946718007e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12296,The Influence of the Non-Pathogenic Fusarium oxysporum Fo47 Strain on Flax Resistance to Pathogens,"Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is a plant of high economic and practical importance valued for its fiber and oil, which have diverse applications in industries such as textiles, food, pharmaceuticals, and construction. Fungal pathogens of the genus Fusarium, however, pose one of the most serious threats to flax cultivation. They are responsible for a number of disease manifestations, notably Fusarium wilt and root rot. In the case of fusariosis, there is a lack of plant protection products, and often the only effective approach is to use resistant flax cultivars or to discontinue cultivation for several years. Currently, much attention is paid to biological methods of plant protection, which do not exert a negative influence on the environment or human health and are important for sustainable agriculture. The aim of the present study was to assess the potential of the non-pathogenic endophytic fungal strain Fusarium oxysporum Fo47 in protecting plants against pathogenic fungi. The results showed that pretreatment of flax plants with Fo47 increased resistance of plants to all tested fungi (F. oxysporum, Fusarium culmorum, Rhizoctonia solani). Fo47 was the most effective for protection against F. culmorum for the Jan flax cultivar and R. solani for the Bukoz cultivar. Pretreatment with Fo47 of flax plants inoculated with F. culmorum caused an increase in the level of secondary metabolites involved in plant resistance (phenolics) and photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a and b) compared to plants treated only with the pathogenic fungal strain. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed structural changes in the polymers of cell walls. The highest intensities of vibrations characteristic of lignin and pectin were observed for flax treated with Fo47 and infected with F. culmorum, suggesting the highest level of these polymers, higher than in plants treated only with pathogenic fungi. Thus, it can be concluded that application of the non-pathogenic strain strengthened the immune response of flax plants. These results highlight the strong potential of the non-pathogenic strain as a biological control agent, especially for Fusarium infection in flax.","Liszka, J; Dyminska, L; Laba, W; Wróbel-Kwiatkowska, M",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES,2025,10.3390/ijms26094396,0.974998639901161,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.983469393374415,0.0165306066255848,0.999999976391735,2.36082646765112e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1153,Phosphorus induced changes in food quality enhance porina fitness feeding on Epichloë endophyte free forage grasses,"The increasing expenses and environmental repercussions associated with phosphorus (P) fertiliser underscore the necessity for precision-managed application methods. These changes affect pastoral systems, where cool-season grasses like perennial ryegrass and meadow fescue form beneficial relationships with Epichlo & euml; endophytes. Understanding how fertilisers influence these endophytes, host grasses, and insect pests is crucial, as Epichlo & euml; endophytes enhance resistance to some herbivorous insects. This study examined the indirect impact of various P fertiliser regimes on cool-season grasses, which serve as food sources for porina larvae (Wiseana copularis), a significant pasture pest in New Zealand. Endophyte-infected (Epichlo & euml; sp. LpTG-3 strain AR37) perennial ryegrass and meadow fescue infected with E. uncinata (strain MaxR (AR1017)), alongside their endophyte-free counterparts were grown in P-enriched soil with varying Olsen P levels (9, 18, 28, and 78 mg/L). Freeze-dried foliage was added to semi-synthetic diets and fed to porina larvae in a no-choice assay. Measurements included diet consumption, porina survival, weight gain. Measurements in foliage included fungal alkaloid concentration, fungal biomass, and plant nutrient levels. Endophyte infection of AR37 and MaxR significantly reduced porina diet consumption, larval weight gain and survival irrespective of soil Olsen P levels to the plant. Loline alkaloid concentration in MaxR-infected herbage increased with increasing soil Olsen P levels while fungal mass remained unchanged. In endophyte-free grasses, porina larvae significantly increased their diet consumption, weight gain and survival as the Olsen P level available to the host plant increased. While endophyte strains AR37 and MaxR continue to protect their hosts under different Olsen P regimes, these results suggest that the improved performance of porina on endophyte-free plants is largely driven by P-induced changes in food quality. Here, we discuss the implications of porina damage in New Zealand pastures in the context of decreasing P availability.","Hewitt, KG; Hofmann, RW; Ball, OJ; Finch, SC; Bryant, RH; Popay, AJ",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2025,10.1038/s41598-025-89723-5,0.984566528308874,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996263488872745,0.00373651112725484,0.999999999985506,1.4494294653388798e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

However, the diversity of carbon source utilization by xylariaceous fungi and the relative effects on this from environmental and phylogenetic factors are largely unknown. This study assessed the metabolic diversity and redundancy of xylariaceous fungi, associated with leaf litter decomposition, by measuring their in vitro capacity to utilize multiple carbon sources. The work identified the relative influences of geographic and climatic sources, as well as the taxonomic and phylogenetic relatedness, of the fungi. Using Biolog EcoPlate (TM), 43 isolates belonging to Nemania, Xylaria, Nodulisporium, Astrocystis, and Hypoxylon, isolated from Castanopsis sieboldii leaf litter at eight sites in Japan, were found to have the capacity to utilize a variety of carbohydrates, amino acids/amines, carboxylic acids, and polymers. The genera of xylariaceous fungi and their origins significantly affected their metabolic diversity and utilization of carbon sources. Variation partitioning demonstrated that dissimilarities in carbon utilization among fungal isolates were mostly attributable to site differences, especially climatic factors: mean annual temperature and precipitation, and maximum snow depth. Moreover, xylariaceous isolates that originated from adjacent sites tended to have similar patterns of carbon source utilization, suggesting metabolic acclimation to local environmental conditions.","Tabuchi, K; Hirose, D; Hasegawa, M; Osono, T",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2022,10.3390/jof8070701,0.985399049034337,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.951111928081423,0.0488880719185773,0.99999569636343,4.30363656966914e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12392,Optimizing the Culture Medium of Lasiodiplodia sp. to Improve the Yield of Ethyl Acetate Extract as an Antimicrobial Source,"Endophytes often inhabit plant tissues and cause no disease symptoms. Lasiodiplodia is generally considered a pathogenic fungus, but such a genus is capable of producing high-value bioactive molecules, such as enzymes, secondary metabolites including antimicrobials. Therefore, Lasiodiplodia sp. endophyte was cultivated in static mode for 12 days and EtOAc extracts were obtained and evaluated against pathogens afterward. Fermentation parameters (glucose, sucrose and NaNO3) were optimized by the factorial design and response surface methodology, as these are powerful tools to provide reliable information about fungal culture conditions and EtOAc extract yields were considered as response variables. Lasiodiplodia growth curve indicated that optimal production of EtOAc extract mass was achieved after 12 days of fermentation (284 mg 300 mL(-1) broth), which is in agreement with values obtained from validation tests. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Microbicidal Concentration (MMC) essays suggested that the endophyte produce substances presenting antimicrobial and antifungal activities against ATCC Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans strains at optimum point under evaluated conditions. MIC values ranged between 50 and 100 mu g mL(-1) for both pathogens, while MMC of C. albicans ranged from 100 to 200 mu g mL(-1), which evidence its fungicidal effect. Furthermore, it was found that the EtOAc extract yield can be increased by optimizing carbon and nitrogen sources in endophyte cultivation, and there was good agreement between predicted and experimental values under optimized conditions. Thus, Lasiodiplodia fungi are promising sources of antimicrobials and changes in carbon and nitrogen sources can improve the yield of secondary metabolites according to the factorial design.","Moreira, DMB; Gómez, OC; Hirata, DB; Luiz, JHH",CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY,2022,10.1007/s00284-022-02916-3,0.983309504994105,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99704484655248,0.00295515344751964,0.99999848642661,1.51357338973312e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Nascent technologies, such as employing endophytic fungi to induce crop adaptogenic changes, are being explored. In this study, 62 isolates of fungi existing as endophytes were recovered from different parts of a drought-resistant rice variety and screened for salinity and drought tolerance. Nigrospora oryzae #2OSTUR9a exhibited in vitro antioxidant potential, indole acetic acid (351.01 7.11 mu g/mL), phosphate solubilisation (PI 1.115 +/- 0.02), siderophore (72.57% +/- 0.19%) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase production (305.36 +/- 0.80 nmol alpha-ketobutyrate/mg/h). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on salinity and drought stress mitigation in rice plants by endophytic N. oryzae. In treated plants under salinity stress, the relative water, chlorophyll, phenolic and osmolyte content increased by 48.39%, 30.94%, 25.32% and 43.67%, respectively, compared with their respective controls. A similar trend was observed under drought stress, where the above parameters increased by 50.31%, 39.47%, 32.95% and 50.42%, respectively. Additionally, the antioxidant status of the treated plants was much higher because of the enhanced antioxidant enzymes and reduced lipid peroxidation. Our findings indicate the ability of N. oryzae to effectively mitigate the impact of stress, thereby enabling the rice plant to sustain stress conditions.","Sodhi, GK; Saxena, S",FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY,2023,10.1093/femsec/fiad094,0.792908214948862,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999351333795778,6.4866620422212e-4,0.999999996955233,3.04476677204235e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

10131,A seed dressing combining fungal endophyte spores and fungicides improves seedling survival and early growth in barley and oat,"The use of beneficial fungi as crop inoculants is constrained by the need for application of fungicides because the pathogen controlling fungicides often concurrently suppress the efficacy of the beneficial mycobiont. Root endophytic fungi have been shown to improve agronomic traits in spring barley and may be less sensitive to the regularly applied foliar fungicides. We hypothesised that a consortium of fungal endophyte species applied as a seed spore dressing may improve the germination and subsequent growth of barley and oat seedlings. We tested a range of seed dressings to evaluate the effects of the endophytes: untreated seed, regular fungicidal dressing (triticonazole and prochloraz), endophyte seed spore dressing and a combination of endophyte and fungicide. We found significant increases in mean barley seedling length induced by the endophytes after 28 days of seedling growth at time points of up to 6 months from seed dressing. The increases in mean seedling length were greatest for the combined fungal endophyte and fungicide treatment. For the oat cultivar, we found even more substantial endophyte associated increases in mean seedling length. These results indicate that the endophytes tested here are persistent in a seed dressing, enhance early seedling growth, are fungicide tolerant and are competent in two different genera of cereal crops.","Murphy, B; Doohan, F; Hodkinson, T",SYMBIOSIS,2017,10.1007/s13199-016-0418-7,0.991650241186684,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993047117271286,0.00695288272871393,0.999999990514951,9.48504863540478e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

3529,Expanding the Chemical Repertoire of the Endophyte Streptomyces albospinus RLe7 Reveals Amphotericin B as an Inducer of a Fungal Phenotype,"During an investigation of the chemistry of the endophytic actinobacterium Streptomyces albospinus RLe7, which was isolated from the roots of the Brazilian medicinal plant Lychnophora ericoides, three new natural products, (2R*,4S*)-2-((1'S*)-hydroxy-4'-methylpenty1)-4-(hydroxymethyl)butanolide (1), (3R*,4S*,5R*,6S*)-tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-3,5,6-trimethy1-2-pyranone (2), and 1-O-(phenylacetyl)glycerol (3), together with known secondary metabolites (S)-4-benzyl-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo [2,1-c] [1,4]oxazine-6-carbaldehyde (4), (S)-4-isobuty1-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[2,1-c]-[1,4]oxazine-6-carbaldehyde (5), and the diketopiperazines cyclo(L-Tyr-L-Pro) (6) and cyclo(L-Val-L-Pro) (7), were isolated. The role of isolated natural products in the interaction between S. albospinus RLe7 and the fungus Coniochaeta sp. FLe4, an endophyte from the same plant, was investigated. None of these isolated actinobacterial compounds were able to inhibit the fungus or induce the fungal red pigmentation observed when both endophytes interact. Further investigation using mass spectrometry approaches enabled identifying the well-known antifungal compound amphotericin B (9) as a microbial metabolite of S. albospinus RLe7. Finally, compound 9 was demonstrated as at least one of the agents responsible for both the antifungal activity and induction of red pigmented fungal phenotype.","Chagas, FO; Caraballo-Rodríguez, AM; Dorrestein, PC; Pupo, MT",JOURNAL OF NATURAL PRODUCTS,2017,10.1021/acs.jnatprod.6b00870,0.751173517850025,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999999627185949,3.7281405058078e-7,0.999999813563533,1.86436467042306e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
5342,"Induction of the sexual stage of Pestalotiopsis microspora, a taxol-producing fungus","Pestalotiopsis microspora, isolate NE-32, is an endophyte of the Himalayan yew (Taxus wallichiana) that produces taxol, an important chemotherapeutic drug used in the treatment of breast and ovarian cancers. Conditions were determined to induce the perfect stage (teleomorph) of this organism in the laboratory as a critical first step to study inheritance of taxol biosynthetic genes. The perfect stage of Pestalotiopsis microspora NE-32 forms in a period of 3-6 weeks on water agarose with dried yew needles at 16-20 degrees C with 12 h of light per day. Morphological analysis of the teleomorph and sequencing of the 18S rDNA indicates that Pestalosphaeria hansenii is the perfect stage of Pestalotiopsis microspora. Only certain plants (e.g. yews, some pines, pecan, oat and some barley cultivars) allow the production of perithecia. Exhaustive methylene chloride extraction of yew (Taxus cuspidata) needles removes their capacity to induce production of perithecia. The methylene chloride extract is able to induce formation of perithecia by strain NE-32 in a bioassay system utilizing the sterilized sheaths of the Cholla cactus (Opuntia bigelovii) spine, indicating that a chemical compound(s) in yew stimulates the formation of the perfect stage. This hydrophobic plant compound(s) has been designated the perithecial-stimulating factor (PSF). The data suggest that plant products may play a role in regulating the biology of endophytic microbes.","Metz, AM; Haddad, A; Worapong, J; Long, DM; Ford, EJ; Hess, WM; Strobel, GA",MICROBIOLOGY-UK,2000,10.1099/00221287-146-8-2079,0.973818795503165,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995340657558406,0.00465934244159396,0.999999997899926,2.1000743366528203e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18952,Bacterial seed endophytes promote barley growth and inhibits Fusarium graminearum in vitro.,"Seeds host microbes that function in plant growth and phytopathogen resistance. The aim of the work was to investigate total bacterial community in malting barley seeds and whether their bacterial seed endophytes have dual functional roles in plant growth-promotion and inhibition of Fusarium graminearum, the causative agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) in barley. We used culture dependent and culture independent methods. Phylogenetic classification of seed endophytic bacteria based on sequencing data identified B. subtilis, B. licheniformis and B. pumilis as predominant subgroups. Location driven divergence in bacterial endophytic communities was evident based on a clear separation of the samples from Crookston and other location samples. The bio-primed seeds using one hundred and seventy bacterial isolates showed that 3.5% (6/170) of the bacterial isolates conferred greater than 10% increase in both root length (RL) and shoot length (SL), while 19.4% (33/170) and 26.5% (45/170) showed RL and SL specific growth effects, respectively, relative to controls. Among the six bacterial isolates that increased RL and SL, five (#29, #63, #109, #124 and #126) also significantly inhibit the growth of F. graminearum based on in vitro assays.

2493,Enhanced sulfamethoxazole degradation in soil by immobilized sulfamethoxazole-degrading microbes on bagasse,"The presence of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) in the environment is becoming a serious problem because of its toxicity and high risk to human health and microbial activity. In this study, enhanced degradation of this compound in soil is shown by sulfamethoxazole-degrading microbes when using bagasse to pre-grow these microbial sources. The two sulfamethoxazole-degrading strains, T2 and Z3, isolated from pig manure, were selected for an immobilized microorganism technique. T2 and Z3 were identified as Enterobacter cloacae and a fungal endophyte by detailed morphological, biochemical and molecular characterization. The performance of the immobilized cells on agricultural residues (bagasse) in the biodegradation of sulfamethoxazole in soil was greater than that of cells free in solution. The effects of pH, temperature, indigenous soil microbes, and heavy metals on bioremediation were investigated, as well as the products of SMX degradation by strains, and a series of experiments at an initial concentration of 100 mg kg(-1) were performed at various temperatures (23-43 degrees C) and pHs (2.5-6.5). SMX degradation was affected by the initial temperature and pH because of the effect on the essential groups in the activation center of enzymes and membrane permeability. At 28 degrees C and pH 3.5, the immobilized strain T2 showed an excellent ability to degrade sulfamethoxazole in soil; 84.14% removal rate of SMX was achieved.","Hu, SB; Hu, HM; Li, WL; Ke, YY; Li, MH; Zhao, YC",RSC ADVANCES,2017,10.1039/c7ra10150c,0.858741425191884,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999571457181391,4.2854281860938e-4,0.99999999996272,3.7279734854678294e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2723,Succession of tissue microbial community during oat developmental,"Investigating oat tissue microflora during its different developmental stages is necessary for understanding its growth and anti-disease mechanism. In this study, 16S rDNA and ITS (Internally Transcribed Spacer) high-throughput sequencing technology were used to explore the microflora diversity of oat tissue. Twenty-seven samples of leaves, stems, and roots from three developmental stages, namely the seedling stage (SS), jointing stage (JS), and maturity stage (MS), underwent sequencing analysis. The analysis showed that 6480 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified in the examined samples, of which 1698 were fungal and 4782 were bacterial. Furthermore, 126 OTUs were shared by fungi, mainly Ascomycota , Basidiomycota , and Mucoromycota at the phylum level, and 39 OTUs were shared by bacteria, mainly Actinobacteriota and Proteobacteria at the phylum level. The microbial diversity of oat tissue in the three developmental stages showed differences, and the alpha-diversity of the bacteria and beta-diversity of the bacteria and fungi in the roots were higher than those of the stems and leaves. Among the bacteria species, Thiiopseudomonas, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group , and Brevibacterium were predominant in the leaves, MND1 was predominant in the roots, and Lactobacillus was predominant in the stems. Moreover, Brevibacterium maintained a stable state at all growth stages. In the fungal species, Phomatospora was dominant in the leaves, Kondoa was dominant in the roots, and Pyrenophora was dominant in the stems. All species with a high abundance were related to the growth process of oats and antagonistic bacteria. Furthermore, connection modules were denser in bacterial than in fungal populations. The samples were treated with superoxide dismutase and peroxidase. There were 42 strains associated with SOD (Superoxide dismutase), 60 strains associated with POD (Peroxidase), and 38 strains in total, which much higher than fungi. The network analysis showed that bacteria might have more dense connection modules than fungi, The number of bacterial connections to enzymes were much higher than that of fungi. Furthermore, these results provide a basis for further mechanistic research.","Cheng, C; Zhang, YH; Zhang, LC; Guo, JJ; Xu, SH; Gao, PF; Fan, KX; He, YW; Gong, YC; Zhong, G; Su, SF; Liu, ZG",HELIYON,2024,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e30276,0.902686287532406,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996721247752814,0.0032787522471856,0.99999999384696,6.1530398554055e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
7195,Investigation of Pro-angiogenic and Wound Healing Activity of Mycosynthesized Iron-Oxide Nanoparticles,"Iron oxide nanoparticles were mycosynthesized (M.FeONPs) using an aqueous extract of Arthrinium aureum, an endophytic fungus from Aegiceras corniculatum, and compared with chemically synthesized iron oxide nanoparticles (FeONPs) for their angiogenic and wound healing properties. The findings suggest that M.FeONPs enhanced cell proliferation, viability, migration, and capillary-like tube formation in endothelial cells [EA.hy926 cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)]. Furthermore, it upregulates the gene expression of eNOS and VEGF. In contrast, FeONPs did not show these effects during the study of angiogenesis. Similarly, the M.FeONPs improved the blood micro-vasculature formation in chick embryos assay and also observed the accelerated wound healing through increased blood flow around the wound area in an animal model. This pro-angiogenic activity of M.FeONPs is linked to the upregulation of NOX (NADPH oxidase 2) and activation of the PI3K/Akt/MAPK pathway. Based on the safety assessment results and non-immunogenicity studies, M.FeONPs could be a promising bio-compatible and pro-angiogenic agent for treating various vascular-related diseases (wound healing, ischemic).","Mandarada, AP; Roy, A; Misra, S; Patra, CR; Mutheneni, SR",BIONANOSCIENCE,2025,10.1007/s12668-025-01982-8,0.932872318278497,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999836159280155,1.6384071984504e-4,0.999999990603077,9.39692312851292e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1046,Impact of dark septate endophytes on salt stress alleviation of tomato plants,"Fungal endophytes can improve plant tolerance to abiotic stress conditions. Dark septate endophytes (DSEs) belong to phylogenetically non-related groups of root colonizing fungi among the Ascomycota with high melanin-producing activities. They can be isolated from roots of more than 600 plant species in diverse ecosystems. Still the knowledge about their interaction with host plants and their contribution to stress alleviation is limited. The current work aimed to test the abilities of three DSEs (Periconia macrospinosa, Cadophora sp., Leptodontidium sp.) to alleviate moderate and high salt stress in tomato plants. By including an albino mutant, the role of melanin for the interaction with plants and salt stress alleviation could also be tested. P. macrospinosa and Cadophora sp. improved shoot and root growth 6 weeks after inoculation under moderate and high salt stress conditions. No matter how much salt stress was applied, macroelement (P, N, and C) contents were unaffected by DSE inoculation. The four tested DSE strains successfully colonized the roots of tomato, but the colonization level was clearly reduced in the albino mutant of Leptodontidium sp. Any difference in the effects on plant growth between the Leptodontidium sp. wild type strain and the albino mutant could, however, not be observed. These results show that particular DSEs are able to increase salt tolerance as they promote plant growth specifically under stress condition. Increased plant biomasses combined with stable nutrient contents resulted in higher P uptake in shoots of inoculated plants at moderate and high salt conditions and higher N uptake in the absence of salt stress in all inoculated plants, in P. macrospinosa-inoculated plants at moderate salt condition and in all inoculated plants except the albino mutants at high salt condition. In summary, melanin in DSEs seems to be important for the colonization process, but does not influence growth, nutrient uptake or salt tolerance of plants.","Gaber, DA; Berthelot, C; Blaudez, D; Kovács, GM; Franken, P",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2023,10.3389/fmicb.2023.1124879,0.979185504973026,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999993638512799,6.36148720084274e-6,1,2.2204460492503099e-16,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11562,"Development of multiplex PCR protocols for simultaneous detection of Alternaria padwickii, Bipolaris oryzae, Pyricularia oryzae and Ustilaginoidea virens in rice seed","Rice, a staple crop sustaining over half of the global population, is widely cultivated and traded as crop as well as exchanged globally in the form of germplasm. This crop is particularly susceptible to seed-borne fungal pathogens such as Alternaria padwickii, Bipolaris oryzae, Pyricularia oryzae and Ustilaginoidea virens, which pose significant threats to seed health, conservation, and transboundary movement. To address these risks, we developed robust two multiplex PCR protocols capable of simultaneously detecting A. padwickii, B. oryzae and P. oryzae and A. padwickii, P. oryzae and U. virens using specific primer sets: ApEF-1F&1R designed from translation elongation factor 1 (EF 1) region of A. padwickii, BoSP7-F&R designed from ATCC 44560 unplaced genomic scaffold_136 of B. oryzae, PoM-1F&1R designed from hydrophobin-like protein (MPG1) gene region of P. oryzae and UvP-1F&1R designed from internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of U. virens. These primers amplified distinct target sequences of 175, 325, 520, and 240 bp, respectively, with an optimal annealing temperature of 62 degrees C. Sensitivity test revealed that the primers detect only target pathogens at concentration of DNA as low as 0.1 ng mu l- 1 of each pathogen, demonstrating high specificity. These findings aim to provide a robust tool for ensuring seed health testing, potentially improving disease management, reducing post-harvest losses, and supporting disease-free long-term conservation, seed certification, and expediting quick quarantine processing of rice seed.","Kumar, P; Akhtar, J; Meena, BR; Kiran, R; Tiwari, R; Chalam, VC",PHYSIOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY,2025,10.1016/j.pmpp.2025.102786,0.986383625003185,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993102436344086,0.00689756365591411,0.999999951760903,4.82390966061175e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15510,The efficiency of chemical fungicides in the improvement of seed quality and control of Alternaria leaf spot disease of coriander,"Background and Objective Alternaria leaf spot disease, with the common agent of Alternaria alternata, is one of the most important seed-borne diseases of coriander. The present study aimed to identify seed-borne fungi isolated from native coriander seed populations based on morphological and molecular characteristics. In addition, the efficiency and effectiveness of seed treatment with chemical fungicides on vigor and germination indices, as well as the control of seed-borne diseases were evaluated. Materials and Methods In order to identify the seed-borne fungi of coriander, seed populations from the fields in South Khorasan, Alborz, Markazi, Qazvin, and Hamedan provinces of Iran were sampled according to the International Rules for Seed Testing. After isolation and purification, fungal isolates were identified and confirmed based on morphological characteristics and species-specific primers. Furthermore, the level of pathogenicity and the aggressiveness of isolates were assessed by pathogenicity test on seedlings. The effectiveness of seed treatment with Iprodione-Carbendazim (Rovral-TS®) and Mancozeb (Dithane M-45®) fungicides on germination and vigor indices, as well as the rate of disease progression were investigated. Results A total of eight isolates of Alternaria alternata were identified based on morphological and molecular characteristics. The germination and vigor indices varied among seed populations and it seemed that a part of the observed differences was due to infection by seed-borne fungi. The results of the pathogenicity test showed that approximately 62.5% of the isolates were pathogenic and 37.5% were non-pathogenic. Diverse levels of pathogenicity and aggressiveness were observed for various isolates of A. alternata. Seed treatment with chemical fungicides had a significant influence on germination and vigor indices. Fungicides did not completely control the seed-borne Alternaria leaf spot disease of coriander. Discussion The findings of the current research demonstrated that the effective inhibitory concentrations of chemical fungicides varied based on the pathogenicity of distinct isolates of A. alternata. Disinfection of seeds with Iprodione-Carbendazim fungicide caused a lower disease index of A. alternata on coriander seedlings, compared to Mancozeb. In conclusion, the cultivation of Nahavand seed population out of all the evaluated coriander populations and the disinfection of seeds with Iprodione-Carbendazim fungicide before sowing in all areas suitable for the cultivation of this product are recommended. © 2021 by the authors.",Khaledi N.; Assareh M.H.,Plant Protection (Iran),2021,10.22055/ppr.2021.17129,0.911878654574551,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99668140943647,0.00331859056352952,0.999999984099388,1.59006117161908e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11731,Neotyphodium endophytes trigger salt resistance in tall and meadow fescues,"Infection with Neotyphodium spp. endophytes increases resistance to drought stress and soil mineral imbalances in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. = Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) S. J. Darbysh.) and meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis Huds. = Lolium pratense (Huds.) Darbysh.). We hypothesized that resistance of these grasses to salinity stress may also be attributed to endophyte infection. Two tall fescue genotypes, Fa75 and Fa83, and one meadow fescue genotype, Fp60, infected (E+) with their endophytic fungi, Neotyphodium coenophialum (Glenn, Bacon and Hanlin) and N. uncinatum (Glenn, Bacon and Hanlin), respectively, and their noninfected counterparts (E-) were cultured in nutrient solution at three salinity levels of 0, 85, and 170 mM NaCl. Except for genotype Fa75, E+ plants exhibited higher leaf survival rates than E-clones at a high salinity level (170 mM). Root dry matter was higher in E+ than in E-plants, but shoot dry matter was not affected by endophyte infection. This resulted in a lower shoot-to-root ratio in E+ plants (1.63) compared with E-plants (2.40). Sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) concentrations were greater in roots of E-than in E+ clones. In shoots, Na+ and Cl- concentrations were not affected by the endophyte. In contrast, E+ plants accumulated more potassium (K+), which resulted in a greater K+ : Na+ ratio in shoots of E+ than in those of E-plants. Our results show that endophyte infection reduced Na+ and Cl- concentrations in tall fescue and meadow fescue roots but increased K+ concentrations in the shoots. Based on these results, we conclude that endophyte-infected grasses may thrive better in salinity-stress environments.","Sabzalian, MR; Mirlohi, A",JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION AND SOIL SCIENCE,2010,10.1002/jpln.200900345,0.667629192199337,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994498895229547,0.00550110477045279,0.999999995376895,4.623105342993481e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
