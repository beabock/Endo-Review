17947,"Bio-based remediation of petroleum-contaminated saline soils: Challenges, the current state-of-the-art and future prospects.","Exploiting synergism between plants and microbes offers a potential means of remediating soils contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs). Salinity alters the physicochemical characteristics of soils and suppresses the growth of both plants and soil microbes, so the bioremediation of saline soils requires the use of plants and in microbes which can tolerate salinity. This review focuses on the management of PHC-contaminated saline soils, surveying what is currently known with respect to the potential of halophytes (plants adapted to saline environments) acting in concert with synergistic microbes to degrade PHCs. The priority is to identify optimal combinations of halophyte(s) and the bacteria present as endophytes and/or associated with the rhizosphere, and to determine what are the factors which most strongly affect their viability.",Khoshkholgh Sima NA; Ebadi A; Reiahisamani N; Rasekh B,Journal of environmental management,2019,10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109476,0.519608550923483,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.986483875118825,0.0135161248811755,0.999999871772063,1.28227937046255e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
8535,Alkaloid Contents in Epichloe Endophyte-Infected Elymus tangutorum Sampled along an Elevation Gradient on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau,"Alkaloids produced by endophytic fungi can have an important influence on agricultural ecology, and can often be affected by climatic factors. At present, there are no studies that have assessed the relationship between alkaloid production and elevation or climatic factors in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. To address this knowledge gap, we explored ergot alkaloid and peramine production in Epichloe-infected (E+) Elymus tangutorum collected from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau and assessed the relationship between the concentration of these alkaloids and elevation. The effects of temperature and precipitation on these relationships were also investigated. The concentrations of ergonovine, ergine, and peramine ranged from 0.47-0.84, 0.35-1.72 and 9.18-13.00 mu g center dot g(-1), respectively. Fitted cubic regression curves describing an arc-pattern across the elevational series were statistically significant for ergine and peramine concentrations. The elevational trend in peramine concentration was linked to mean daily temperature, while the ergine elevational trend was linked to mean precipitation. Our results provide a new understanding of the climatic factors that influence the alkaloid production of endophytic fungi at different elevations in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.","Shi, Q; Matthew, C; Liu, WH; Nan, ZB",AGRONOMY-BASEL,2020,10.3390/agronomy10111812,0.9407396790121,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.982953372146221,0.017046627853779,0.9999768657118,2.31342881996666e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
14302,Characterization of Bioactive Metabolites of Endophytic Fusarium solani Isolated from Withania somnifera,"This study was conducted to characterize and explore the endophytic fungi of Withania somnifera plant for their bioactive potential. A total of 70 segments of W. somnifera were screened and the highest species richness, as well as frequency of colonization was found in root determined as 25%. Endophytic fungi shown significant antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, E.coli, Proteus sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas sp. and were identified as Corynespora cassicola, Fusarium solani and Penicillium chrysogenum. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by the micro dilution broth was in the range of 21-82 μg/mL. Isolates revealed the presence of different phytochemicals, which includes, terpenoids, tannins, alkaloids and flavonoids. Based on its antibacterial, antioxidant and cytotoxic potential, Fusarium solani was selected, characterized genotypically by 28S rDNA typing and the sequence was deposited in NCBI database under accession number KJ193849. Fusarium solani was found to possess higher relative percentage reducing power of about 90.62% than that of Corynespora cassicola (57.47%) and Penicillium chrysogenum (52.37%) and the absorbance value obtained is comparable with the control. Percentage cell viability on cultured HeLa cell lines was determined as 6.25 μg/mL (64.74%), 12.5 μg/mL (61.08%), 25 μg/mL (58.68%), 50 μg/mL (53.24%), and 100 μg/mL (49.94%).There was significant reduction in the viability of cancer cells at 100 μg/mL. GC-MS analysis of the HPTLC fractions of Fusarium solani showed a wide range of compounds and the compounds taraxasterol, acenaphthylene, 3,4-oxadiazole, benzenamine were pharmaceutically important. © 2017, © 2017 Har Krishan Bhalla & Sons.",Aswani P.; Tijith K.; George; Jisha M.S.,Journal of Biologically Active Products from Nature,2017,10.1080/22311866.2017.1417058,0.952691034421547,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993489148045012,0.00651085195498822,0.999999981394106,1.86058939366518e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6893,"Benefits of Endophytic Fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris Inoculation for Improving Mineral Nutrition, Quality, and Yield of Rice Grains Under Low Nitrogen and Phosphorus Condition","The deficiency of N-P availability in soil is a primary cause for crop yield and nutrient loss. Since plant-beneficial microbial symbiosis is an eco-friendly method for compensating this negative effect, understanding the interconnection between endophytic fungus colonization and mineral nutrient accumulation in edible parts of crop is important in agricultural production. In this study, we focused on the effects of endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris on the absorption and distribution of 14 essential mineral elements in vegetative organs (root and shoot) and reproductive organs (grain) of rice during its growing period with reduced N-P fertilizer application, as well as the changes in yield, quality, and mineral nutrition of rice grains. The possible mechanisms including the transcriptional level of the transport-related genes and the structure of endophytic community were also investigated. The results indicated that the P. liquidambaris significantly increased the accumulation of N, P, Fe, Mn, Zn, Mo, and Se in rice grains by 20.5%, 18.9%, 18.2%, 9.5%, 17.9%, 13.3%, and 17.1%, respectively, accompanied by the significant increase in yield (23.8%) and protein content (17.3%). These beneficial effects were attributed to the enhancement formation of iron plaque, the upregulation of nutrient transporters genes, and the altered endophyte community by P. liquidambaris symbiosis. In conclusion, P. liquidambaris could promote the partition of nutrients to the grains by increasing the efficiency of nutrient uptake and remobilization. Our results suggest P. liquidambaris symbiosis as a useful candidate for improving the mineral nutrition, quality, and yield of rice grains under N-P-deficient field condition.","Tang, MJ; Lu, F; Yang, Y; Sun, K; Zhu, Q; Xu, FJ; Zhang, W; Dai, CC",JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION,2022,10.1007/s00344-021-10462-8,0.990834486170133,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99978712745991,2.1287254008957e-4,0.999999982408473,1.75915265687721e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
20618,Histological investigations of healthy tissues of Catharanthus roseus to localize fungal endophytes,"Catharanthus roseus is an important medicinal plant known for its potential therapeutic terpenoid indole alkaloids. The aerial and underground parts of the plant are transcriptionally distinct and known to produce distinct spectrum of terpenoid indole alkaloids. Production of a plant-based natural drug is not always up to the desired level. Considering the limitations associated with the productivity, microorganisms serve as the ultimate and inexhaustible source of novel structures bearing pharmaceutical potential. Endophytes, the microorganisms residing inside the healthy tissues of the host plant are relatively unstudied and offer potential sources of novel natural products for exploitation in medicine, agriculture and the pharmaceutical industry. The present study was carried out to examine the localization and distribution of endophytic fungi present inside the healthy plants tissues of C. roseus (purple and white) variety. The endophytic fungi were detected by incubating the sterilized explants of C. roseus in PDA plates to promote the growth of mycelia. To locate the distribution, fungal endophytes were stained with Lactophenol cotton blue. Dense fungal colony and hyphae were observed in the xylem, phloem, and pith region of both leaf and stem tissues. Dense colonies of endophytes were also observed in cortex of root tissue. Rich localization was observed for C. roseus white variety in leaf and stem tissues.

11993,Endosphere Microbiome and Metabolic Differences Between the Spots and Green Parts of Tricyrtis macropoda Leaves,"Background Plant leaves are important organs for photosynthesis and biological energy production. The leaves of Tricyrtis macropoda have an unusual spotted pattern. However, whether the spots of T. macropoda affect the plant microbiome and metabolites is unclear. In this study, we compared differences in the endosphere microbiome and plant metabolites in green parts and spots and the effects of spots on the photosynthesis of leaves. Methods 16S/ITS sequences and metabolite spectra were obtained by high-throughput amplicon sequencing and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry, respectively. Changes in the diversity of the endophytic microbial community and metabolites were studied, and the effect of T. macropoda leaf spots on photosynthesis was examined by chlorophyll fluorescence. Results The results showed that the relative abundance of Cercospora fungi in the leaf spots of T. macropoda was significantly higher than that in the green parts (P < 0.05) while Colletotrichum fungi showed low abundance in the spots. Alkaloid and ketone metabolites were decreased in the green parts compared with the spots, and amino acids, organic acids, lipids, and other compounds were increased in the green parts compared with the spots. A combined analysis of microbial communities and metabolites showed a significant correlation between the endophytic fungal communities and metabolite production. The changes in these metabolites may cause changes in local leaf color. In addition, we found that the spot areas of T. macropoda can be photosynthetically normal. Conclusion This research showed the relationship between endophytic microorganisms and metabolites, and the findings advance our understanding of endophyte-plant interactions and provide a new direction for investigating the relationship between endophytes and phenotypes.","Wang, Y; Cheng, HY; Chang, F; Zhao, L; Wang, B; Wan, Y; Yue, M",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2021,10.3389/fmicb.2020.599829,0.941263614065455,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.627226059054765,0.372773940945235,0.999995169067863,4.83093213676788e-6,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
13887,Experiments with some of the newer systemic fungicides on apple and marrow,"In field trials against apple scab (caused by Venturia inaequalis) and powdery mildew (caused by Podosphaera leucotricha), improved control of one or other disease has been given by the newer systemic fungicides benomyl, triarimol and the thiophanates. However, in tests on apple seedlings in the greenhouse, biological evidence of translocation from individual deposits was generally limited to movement within the treated leaf. In greenhouse tests with cucumbers and marrows, using Oidium sp., there was again little evidence for movement of toxicant from a treated leaf, although effective disease control was readily obtained by root application of several compounds at low dosage. These results suggest that the systemic properties of the compounds evident when used as soil or seed treatments are of little account when they are applied as foliar sprays.

17858,Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium 14028s Genomic Regions Required for Colonization of Lettuce Leaves.,"Contamination of edible produce leaves with human bacterial pathogens has been associated with serious disease outbreaks and has become a major public health concern affecting all aspects of the market, from farmers to consumers. While pathogen populations residing on the surface of ready-to-eat produce can be potentially removed through thorough washing, there is no disinfection technology available that effectively eliminates internal bacterial populations. By screening 303 multi-gene deletion (MGD) mutants of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) 14028s, we were able to identify ten genomic regions that play a role in opening the stomatal pore of lettuce leaves. The major metabolic functions of the deleted regions are associated with sensing the environment, bacterium movement, transport through the bacterial membrane, and biosynthesis of surface appendages. Interestingly, at 21 days post inoculation, seven of these mutants showed increased population titers inside the leaf, two mutants showed similar titers as the wild type bacterium, whereas one mutant with a large deletion that includes the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) showed significantly impaired persistence in the leaf apoplast. These findings suggest that not all the genomic regions required for initiation of leaf colonization (i.e., epiphytic behavior and tissue penetration) are essential for continuing bacterial survival as an endophyte. We also observed that mutants lacking either SPI-1 (Mut3) or SPI-2 (Mut9) induce callose deposition levels comparable to those of the wild type STm 14028s; therefore, these islands do not seem to affect this lettuce defense mechanism. However, the growth of Mut9, but not Mut3, was significantly impaired in the leaf apoplastic wash fluid (AWF) suggesting that the STm persistence in the apoplast may be linked to nutrient acquisition capabilities or overall bacterial fitness in this niche, which are dependent on the gene(s) deleted in the Mut9 strain. The genetic basis of STm colonization of leaves investigated in this study provides a foundation from which to develop mitigation tactics to enhance food safety.",Montano J; Rossidivito G; Torreano J; Porwollik S; Sela Saldinger S; McClelland M; Melotto M,Frontiers in microbiology,2020,10.3389/fmicb.2020.00006,0.952496518415173,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.968229035390459,0.031770964609541,0.999998464030457,1.53596954288737e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

9875,Genomic landscape of a relict fir-associated fungus reveals rapid convergent adaptation towards endophytism,"Comparative and pan-genomic analyses of the endophytic fungus Pezicula neosporulosa (Helotiales, Ascomycota) from needles of the relict fir, Abies beshanzuensis, showed expansions of carbohydrate metabolism and secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes characteristic for unrelated plant-beneficial helotialean, such as dark septate endophytes and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi. The current species within the relatively young Pliocene genus Pezicula are predominantly saprotrophic, while P. neosporulosa lacks such features. To understand the genomic background of this putatively convergent evolution, we performed population analyses of 77 P. neosporulosa isolates. This revealed a mosaic structure of a dozen non-recombining and highly genetically polymorphic subpopulations with a unique mating system structure. We found that one idiomorph of a probably duplicated mat1-2 gene was found in putatively heterothallic isolates, while the other co-occurred with mat1-1 locus suggesting homothallic reproduction for these strains. Moreover, 24 and 81 genes implicated in plant cell-wall degradation and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, respectively, showed signatures of the balancing selection. These findings highlight the evolutionary pattern of the two gene families for allowing the fungus a rapid adaptation towards endophytism and facilitating diverse symbiotic interactions.","Yuan, ZL; Wu, Q; Xu, LX; Druzhinina, IS; Stukenbrock, EH; Nieuwenhuis, BPS; Zhong, ZH; Liu, ZJ; Wang, XY; Cai, F; Kubicek, CP; Shan, XL; Wang, JY; Shi, GH; Peng, L; Martin, FM",ISME JOURNAL,2022,10.1038/s41396-021-01176-6,0.959301236580305,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995982767898332,0.00401723210166808,0.999999996994275,3.00572489120299e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The leaf endophytic Pseudomonas protegens E1BL2 was previously isolated from giant Jala maize, which is a native Zea mays landrace of Nayarit, Mexico. Using different Mexican maize landraces, this work evaluated the strain's plant growth promotion and biocontrol against eight phytopathogenic fungi in vitro and greenhouse conditions. Also, a plant field trial was conducted on irrigated fields using the hybrid maize Supremo. The grain productivity in this assay increased compared with the control treatment. The genome analysis of P. protegens E1BL2 showed putative genes involved in metabolite synthesis that facilitated its beneficial roles in plant health and environmental adaptation (bdhA, acoR, trpE, speE, potA); siderophores (ptaA, pchC); and extracellular enzymes relevant for PGPB mechanisms (cel3, chi14), protection against oxidative stress (hscA, htpG), nitrogen metabolism (nirD, nit1, hmpA), inductors of plant-induced systemic resistance (ISR) (flaA, flaG, rffA, rfaP), fungal biocontrol (phlD, prtD, prnD, hcnA-1), pest control (vgrG-1, higB-2, aprE, pslA, ppkA), and the establishment of plant-bacteria symbiosis (pgaA, pgaB, pgaC, exbD).

3003,Identification and Quantification of Loline-Type Alkaloids in Endophyte-Infected Grasses by LC-MS/MS,"Lolines, fungal metabolites of the grass endophyte association, were identified and quantified using newly developed LC-MS/MS methods in endophyte-infected grasses belonging to the Lolium and Festuca genera after extraction with three different solvents using two extraction methods. The shaking extraction method with isopropanol/water was superior to the other methods due to its high sensitivity, high accuracy (recovery within or close to the range of 80-120%), and high precision (coefficient of variation of <10%). Seven loline alkaloids were identified and quantified using our newly established LC-MS/MS methods, and N-formylloline was the most abundant (5 mg/g dry matter), followed by N-acetylloline. These LC-MS/MS methods used the shortest sample handling time and the fewest sample preparation steps and proved to be good alternatives to existing GC and GC-MS analytical methods without compromising analytical efficiency. In conclusion, we developed for the first time a highly sensitive quantitative LC-MS/MS analytical method for the accurate and reproducible quantification and a LightSight-assisted LC-QTRAP/MS qualitative method for the tentative identification of loline-type alkaloids in endophyte-infected grasses.","Adhikari, KB; Boelt, B; Fomsgaard, IS",JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY,2016,10.1021/acs.jafc.6b02616,0.909891537502673,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.976183987171546,0.0238160128284542,0.999998767663408,1.23233659232724e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
8209,Metabolomics-based chemotaxonomy of root endophytic fungi for natural products discovery,"Fungi are prolific producers of natural products routinely screened for biotechnological applications, and those living endophytically within plants attract particular attention because of their purported chemical diversity. However, the harnessing of their biosynthetic potential is hampered by a large and often cryptic phylogenetic and ecological diversity, coupled with a lack of large-scale natural products' dereplication studies. To guide efforts to discover new chemistries among root-endophytic fungi, we analyzed the natural products produced by 822 strains using an untargeted UPLC-ESI-MS/MS-based approach and linked the patterns of chemical features to fungal lineages. We detected 17809 compounds of which 7951 were classified in 1992 molecular families, whereas the remaining were considered unique chemistries. Our approach allowed to annotate 1191 compounds with different degrees of accuracy, many of which had known fungal origins. Approximately 61% of the compounds were specific of a fungal order, and differences were observed across lineages in the diversity and characteristics of their chemistries. Chemical profiles also showed variable chemosystematic values across lineages, ranging from relative homogeneity to high heterogeneity among related fungi. Our results provide an extensive resource to dereplicate fungal natural products and may assist future discovery programs by providing a guide for the selection of target fungi.","Maciá-Vicente, JG; Shi, YN; Cheikh-Ali, Z; Grün, P; Glynou, K; Kia, SH; Piepenbring, M; Bode, HB",ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,2018,10.1111/1462-2920.14072,0.959714109444215,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.82881422523492,0.17118577476508,0.999974896178739,2.51038212605303e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

11392,Effect of fungal endophytes on plant growth and nutrient uptake in Trifolium subterraneum and Poa pratensis as affected by plant host specificity,"The introduction of well-adapted species, such as Trifolium subterraneum (subclover) and Poa pratensis (Kentucky bluegrass), might enhance the forage yield and quality of dehesa pastures for feeding livestock. However, the climatic hardness and poor soils in these agrosystems may limit plant establishment and development. Since fungal endophytes have been found to alleviate the environmental stresses of their host, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of five isolates on forage yield, nutritive value, and plant mineral uptake after their inoculation in the two abovementioned plant species. Two experiments were established (under greenhouse and field conditions) using plants inoculated with two isolates in 2012/2013 (Epicoccum nigrum, Sporormiella intermedia) and three isolates in 2013/2014 (Mucor hiemalis, Fusarium equiseti, Byssochlamys spectabilis). Fusarium equiseti (E346) increased the herbage yield of T. subterraneum under greenhouse conditions, and B. spectabilis improved the forage quality of T. subterraneum by reducing fiber content and of P. pratensis by increasing crude protein. S. intermedia increased the mineral uptake of Ca, Cu, Mn, Pb, Tl, and Zn in subclover, and M. hiemalis increased the uptake of K and Sr in Kentucky bluegrass. These results evidence the potential of the studied fungal endophytes to enhance herbage yield and nutritional value of forage, although further studies should include all of the target forage species as certain host specificity in the effect was observed.","García-Latorre, C; Rodrigo, S; Santamaria, O",MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS,2021,10.1007/s11557-021-01732-6,0.978588329811966,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.989846834932707,0.0101531650672925,0.999999687813617,3.12186382744883e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

These organism includes bacteria, actionomycetes and fungi. Endophytes are now extensively utilized in modern medicine and agriculture because of their distinct capacity of producing a wide range of metabolites with effective biological activities. In the present study, anti bacterial activity of endophytic fungal organism Phoma europhyrena isolated from leaf tissue of Clerodendron sp and the antibacterial activity was studied against human pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Surface leaf washing method was adopted to isolate the fungal organism and the isolated fungi was cultured in synthetic liquid media under optimum condition. Extracts were prepared from culture free broth using ethyl acetate. Concentrated crude extract thus obtained was tested against the bacterial strains by agar diffusion solid plate assay and turbidometric liquid broth assay. Antibacterial activity was further confirmed by biofilm inhibition studied by microtitre plate assay. The present findings clearly reveals tested bacterial strains were susceptible to ethyl acetate extract which were all studied by agar diffusion, turbidometric and biofilm inhibition assays.

7500,Endophytic fungi from the medicinal herb Euphorbia geniculata as a potential source for bioactive metabolites,"Many researchers proved that plant endophytes manage successful issues to synthesize active chemicals within plant cells. These bioactive compounds might support a range of plant defense mechanism against many pathogenic microorganisms. In this study, a total of 22 isolates representing 21 fungal species belonging to 15 fungal genera in addition to one variety were isolated and identified for the first time from Euphorbia geniculate plants. The genus Aspergillus was the most common fungus isolated from the studied plant. The fungus Isaria feline was recorded in both leaves and stem, while Aspergillus flavus, A. ochraceus, A. terreus var. terreus, Emercilla nidulans var. acristata, Macrophomina phaseolina colonized both stem and root. The isolated fungi showed antagonistic activities against six strains of plant pathogenic fungi viz., Eupenicillium brefeldianum, Penicillium echinulatum, Alternaria phragmospora, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium verticilloid, and Alternaria alternata in dual culture assay. The highest antagonistic activity fungal species (Aspergillus flavus, A. fumigatus, and Fusarium lateritium) and the lowest (Cladosprium herbarum, F. culomrum, and Sporotrichum thermophile) showed twining in their secondary metabolites especially terpens and alkaloids with that of their host E. geniculata. Three concentrations of (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml) of these secondary metabolites extracted by ethyl acetate and n-butanol from the above six endophytic fungal species were tested against three pathogenic fungi isolated from infected tomato plant (E. brefeldianum-EBT-1, P. echinulatum-PET-2, and A. phragmospora-APT-3), whereas these pathogens showed promising sensitivity to these fungal secondary metabolites.

12148,Fungal Diversity in Fire-Affected Pine Forest Soils at the Upper Tree Line,"Forest fires represent a significant ecological disturbance in ecosystems that increasingly affects Pinus heldreichii H. Christ forests at the upper tree line in Montenegro, due to climate change and anthropogenic factors. Soil samples were collected from five high-altitude sites in the Ku & ccaron;i Mountains, including three post-fire sites (2-, 4-, and 6-years post-fire) and two unburned control sites. High-throughput sequencing and soil chemical analyses were conducted to assess fungal diversity, community composition, and soil nutrient properties. The results showed that fungal diversity was significantly higher in unburned soils compared to post-fire soils, with the most prominent changes in ectomycorrhizal fungi, which are crucial for pine regeneration. The fungal community composition differed markedly between the post-fire and unburned sites, with specific taxa such as Hygrocybe conica (Schaeff.) P. Kumm. and Solicoccozyma aeria (Saito) Yurkov dominating the post-fire environments. Despite this, the fungal richness did not significantly change over time (2-, 4-, or 6-years post-fire), suggesting the slow recovery of fungal communities in high-altitude environments. In addition to shifts in fungal biodiversity, the post-fire soils exhibited higher levels of available phosphorus, likely due to the conversion of organic phosphorus into soluble forms during combustion. However, the organic matter content remained unchanged. This study provided important insights into the long-term ecological impacts of forest fires on high-altitude P. heldreichii forests and underlined the importance of preserving unburned forest areas to maintain fungal biodiversity and support natural regeneration, as well as the potential need for active restoration strategies in fire-affected regions.","Lazarevic, J; Topalovic, A; Menkis, A",FORESTS,2024,10.3390/f15112012,0.899472759819862,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998376200549612,0.0016237994503882,0.999999985581977,1.44180228867086e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16957,"Molecular Detection of Plasmodiophora brassicae, Causal Agent of Clubroot of Crucifers, in Plant and Soil.","Clubroot of crucifers, caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, recently has been identified in canola (Brassica napus) fields in Alberta, Canada. An effective strategy for managing the disease is to avoid planting cruciferous crops in P. brassicae-infested soil, because the pathogen produces resting spores that can remain infectious for many years. A simple, one-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol was developed to detect the pathogen in plant and soil samples. The primers TC1F and TC1R, based on a P. brassicae partial 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence from GenBank, yielded a 548-bp product in the optimized PCR. A second pair of primers, TC2F and TC2R, which amplified a fragment of the 18S and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 regions of the rDNA repeat, also was tested and produced a 519-bp product. Neither set of primers amplified any DNA fragment from noninfected plant hosts, noninfested soil, or common soil fungi and bacteria tested in this study. Quantities of 100 fg or less of total P. brassicae DNA, or 1 × 103 resting spores per gram of soil, could be detected consistently using these primers and PCR protocol, corresponding to an index of disease of 11% or lower when the soil was bioassayed. The protocol also enabled detection of P. brassicae in symptomless root tissue 3 days after inoculation with the pathogen. Therefore, the PCR assay described in this study could provide a reliable diagnosis for routine detection of P. brassicae in plant and soil materials in a specific and rapid manner.",Cao T; Tewari J; Strelkov SE,Plant disease,2007,10.1094/PD-91-0080,0.932506596450895,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.933627571074595,0.0663724289254054,0.999999892144203,1.0785579718231e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

2914,Associations between Ectomycorrhizal Fungi and Bacterial Needle Endophytes in Pinus radiata: Implications for Biotic Selection of Microbial Communities,"Studies of the ecological and evolutionary relationships between plants and their associated microbes have long been focused on single microbes, or single microbial guilds, but in reality, plants associate with a diverse array of microbes from a varied set of guilds. As such, multitrophic interactions among plant-associated microbes from multiple guilds represent an area of developing research, and can reveal how complex microbial communities are structured around plants. Interactions between coniferous plants and their associated microbes provide a good model system for such studies, as conifers host a suite of microorganisms including mutualistic ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi and foliar bacterial endophytes. To investigate the potential role ECM fungi play in structuring foliar bacterial endophyte communities, we sampled three isolated, native populations of Monterey pine (Pious radiata), and used constrained analysis of principal coordinates to relate the community matrices of the ECM fungi and bacterial endophytes. Our results suggest that ECM fungi may be important factors for explaining variation in bacterial endophyte communities but this effect is influenced by population and environmental characteristics, emphasizing the potential importance of other factors biotic or abiotic in determining the composition of bacterial communities. We also classified ECM fungi into categories based on known fungal traits associated with substrate exploration and nutrient mobilization strategies since variation in these traits allows the fungi to acquire nutrients across a wide range of abiotic conditions and may influence the outcome of multi-species interactions. Across populations and environmental factors, none of the traits associated with fungal foraging strategy types significantly structured bacterial assemblages, suggesting these ECM fungal traits are not important for understanding endophyte-ECM interactions. Overall, our results suggest that both biotic species interactions and environmental filtering are important for structuring microbial communities but emphasize the need for more research into these interactions.","Rúa, MA; Wilson, EC; Steele, S; Munters, AR; Hoeksema, JD; Frank, AC",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2016,10.3389/fmicb.2016.00399,0.977957124025219,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.95039495608161,0.0496050439183902,0.999999994273666,5.7263340735858e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

6107,Histopathology of Corn Plants Infected by Endophytic Fungi,"Simple Summary Endophytic fungi are fungi that live all or part of their life cycles within the tissues of their hosts. Although several endophyte-plant interactions are non-pathogenic in nature, it has been reported that upon infection, some endophytic fungi are able to adopt a pathogenic status resulting in disease symptoms in their host plants, ranging in severity from mild to severe. In the present study, light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to investigate the tissue colonization and cell damage of corn plants by three endophytic fungi, Fusarium verticillioides, Fusarium sacchari, and Penicillium citrinum, causing disease symptoms in the roots, stems, and leaves of infected corn plants. Tissue deterioration and cell collapse were produced by endophytic F. verticillioides, while significant cell proliferation and wall thickening were observed in corn plants infected by endophytic F. sacchari. Corn plants infected by P. citrinum showed reductions in cell diameter of the vascular bundles of infected corn tissues. The ability of endophytic fungi recovered from healthy corn plants to cause disease when inoculated in healthy tissues of other corn plants signifies their importance as determinants of corn health and productivity. Endophytic fungi inhabiting plant tissues show extensive functional diversity, ranging from mutualism to pathogenicity. The present study evaluated the histological responses of corn plants to colonization by three species of endophytic fungi isolated from corn. Corn seedlings were inoculated with 1 x 10(6) conidia per mL spore suspensions of endophytic Fusarium verticillioides, Fusarium sacchari, and Penicillium citrinum and observed for 14 days for the emergence of disease symptoms. Histological examination of diseased root, stem, and leaf tissues was conducted using light and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicated that the mean diameters of root phloem, stem vascular bundles, and leaf vascular bundles, of corn plants infected with endophytic P. citrinum (18.91 mu m, 146.96 mu m, and 107.86 mu m, respectively), F. verticillioides (18.75 mu m, 85.45 mu m, and 118.24 mu m, respectively), and F. sacchari (24.15 mu m root phloem, and 98.90 mu m stem vascular bundle diameters), were significantly lower than the root phloem (33.68 mu m), stem vascular bundle (186.77 mu m), and leaf vascular bundle (155.88 mu m) of the uninfected corn plants (p <= 0.05). Endophytic F. verticillioides was the most virulent, resulting in severe degradation and the eventual collapse of infected plant tissues. The study showed that endophytic fungi recovered from corn plants are capable of initiating significant disease responses in infected corn tissues.","Terna, TP; Nor, NMIM; Zakaria, L",BIOLOGY-BASEL,2022,10.3390/biology11050641,0.982605050723983,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.865515582520123,0.134484417479877,0.998734790999429,0.00126520900057114,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
20739,Isolation and biological activity of endophytic fungi from Withania somnifera,"Virtually all plants are hosts to bacteria and fungi that can be classified as endophytes. Endophytes are 'microbes that colonize living internal tissues of plants without causing any immediate, overt negative effects'.

In the present study, Withania somnifera (F: Solanaceae) which produces withanine and withanolides used to cure various diseases was selected for exploring the endophytes associated with it. A total 15 endophytic fungi were isolated from different parts of plant like root, stem and leaf. Surface sterilization of plant material was achieved using sodium hypochlorite (10% or 20% v/v) for 10 min. The fungi were isolated by incubating the plant material on potato dextrose agar supplemented with streptomycin (250 mgl-1) at 27°. The fungal strains were identified by studying their morphological and microscopical characteristics. The fungi were fermented as static cultures in potato dextrose broth for 21 day at 27°C. The culture broth and mycelium were extracted with ethyl acetate and acetone respectively. The combined extracts were tested for antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. Aspergillus sp.

1810,"Effects of nutrient addition on endophyte-associated grass invasion in a long-term, old-field community experiment","Strictly vertically transmitted (hereditary) Epichloe spp. fungal endophytes are symbionts with cool-season pooid host grasses. Such endophytes may increase host invasiveness in the non-native, introduced ranges. However, because costs and benefits for the host can vary with the growing conditions, the endophyte may become locally or temporally extinct when costs outweigh benefits. Our long-term field experiment involved the introduction of seven Schedonorus pratensis (meadow fescue) cultivars hosting Epichloe uncinata endophyte, which represent host-grass populations differing in genetic backgrounds and Epichloe infection frequencies, to an unmanaged old field. In the first 6 years, the host grasses persisted but did not become invasive in the plant community, regardless of their endophyte infection frequency. Subsequently, we hypothesized that increasing nutrient availability would decrease endophyte costs and thus increase the host's success and abundance. We fertilized half of the plots for four additional years and re-examined S. pratensis invasiveness. We predicted that increased nutrient availability would increase S. pratensis abundance and E. uncinata frequency and concentration, as well as decrease plant community diversity, relative to unfertilized plots. Fertilization increased endophyte concentrations in three low-endophyte host populations. However, E. uncinata did not enable S. pratensis populations to achieve high abundance or to reduce plant community diversity in the old field, with or without fertilization. Thus, nutrient availabililty and host invasiveness appear to be decoupled in this study system.","Hager, HA; Roloson, JL; Shukla, K; Yurkonis, KA; Newman, JA",OECOLOGIA,2021,10.1007/s00442-021-04933-8,0.974310884761854,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.955327092564139,0.0446729074358608,0.999984844659977,1.51553400231652e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

4488,18S rDNA gene metabarcoding of microeukaryotes and epi-endophytes in the holobiome of seven species of large brown algae,"Brown algae (Phaeophyceae) are habitat-forming species in coastal ecosystems and include kelp forests and seaweed beds that support a wide diversity of marine life. Host-associated microbial communities are an integral part of phaeophyte biology, and whereas the bacterial microbial partners have received considerable attention, the microbial eukaryotes associated with brown algae have hardly been studied. Here, we used broadly targeted ""pan-eukaryotic"" primers (metabarcoding) to investigate brown algal-associated eukaryotes (the eukaryome). Using this approach, we aimed to investigate the eukaryome of seven large brown algae that are important and common species in coastal ecosystems. We also aimed to assess whether these macroalgae harbor novel eukaryotic diversity and to ascribe putative functional roles to the host-associated eukaryome based on taxonomic affiliation and phylogenetic placement. We detected a significant diversity of microeukaryotic and algal lineages associated with the brown algal species investigated. The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were taxonomically assigned to 10 of the eukaryotic major supergroups, including taxonomic groups known to be associated with seaweeds as epibionts, endobionts, parasites, and commensals. Additionally, we revealed previously unrecorded sequence types, including novel phaeophyte OTUs, particularly in the Fucus spp. samples, that may represent fucoid genomic variants, sequencing artifacts, or undescribed epi-/endophytes. Our results provide baseline data and technical insights that will be useful for more comprehensive seaweed eukaryome studies investigating the evidently lineage-rich and functionally diverse symbionts of brown algae.","Bjorbaekmo, MFM; Brodie, J; Krabberod, AK; Logares, R; Fuss, J; Fredriksen, S; Wold-Dobbe, A; Shalchian-Tabrizi, K; Bass, D",JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY,2023,10.1111/jpy.13377,0.983022090874475,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996732512358116,0.00326748764188425,0.999999991191466,8.808534457394051e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10432,INFECTION BY PATHOGENS AND POPULATION AGE OF HOST PLANTS,"(1) The incidence of disease caused by host-specific systemic fungal pathogens was compared in populations of three host plants, Valeriana sambucifolia, Trientalis europaea and Silene dioica. (2) The study was conducted in an archipelago area in the Gulf of Bothnia, Sweden, subject to isostatic readjustment (land uplift). In this area primary succession is in strikingly different phases on different islands. The height above sea level of an island is correlated with island age and the time since it was first colonized by plants. Approximate ages of host-plant populations could thus be estimated. (3) In all three systems, disease incidence peaks during an early-intermediate phase of population development. In V. sambucifolia maximum disease (84%) occurs in forty to forty-five-year-old populations, in T. europaea in fifty to 100-year-old populations (approximately 45%), and in S. dioica in fifty to 120-year-old populations (approximately 60%). Populations with an estimated age of greater than fifty years for V. sambucifolia, > 400 years for T. europaea and > 300 years for S. dioica show low disease incidences (< 10%). (4) A significant positive correlation between disease incidence and mean host population density was detected only for the Valeriana-Uromyces system, where the pathogen has an annual cycle, in contrast to the other two pathogens, which are perennial. (5) Three hypotheses could account for the observed population age-disease incidence pattern: (i) host population size and density effects, (ii) founder effects and selection for resistance, and (iii) changes in the environment during primary succession.","CARLSSON, U; ELMQVIST, T; WENNSTROM, A; ERICSON, L",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,1990,10.2307/2260954,0.921852109860346,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.984465539677077,0.0155344603229229,0.999998698618355,1.30138164466942e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

4496,Endophytes infection increased the disease resistance of host Achnatherum sibiricum and non-symbiotic neighbours to pathogenic fungi,"Epichloe<spacing diaeresis> infection can affect the fungal disease resistance of host grasses. However, few studies have been reported on the effects of endophyte infection on non-symbiotic neighbours. We surveyed the plant diseases in natural grassland, and compared differences of total disease index between neighboring and non-neighboring plants of Achnatherum sibiricum. Then laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of endophyte on the growth of four pathogen species as well as the brown patch of the host and its neighboring plants. The results of plant disease investigation in natural grassland showed that the major epidemic diseases of grasses were spot blight, rust disease and powdery mildew in Hulunbuir natural grassland. Among common herbages, the total disease index of endophyte-infected A. sibiricum was the lowest. Compared with nonneighboring plants, the brown patch disease index of Leymus chinensis, Stipa baicalensis and Agropyron cristatum was significantly reduced when neighbouring with A. sibiricum. The laboratory experiments results showed that the culture filtration of both Epichloe<spacing diaeresis> gansuensis and Epichloe<spacing diaeresis> sibiricum significantly restrained the growth of Curvularia lunata, Bipolaris sorokiniana, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Sclerotinia trifoliorum. The two species of endophytes could reduce lesion area of detached host leaves. In vivo plant experiments, the endophyte reduced the disease resistance of both the host and its neighbor grasses L. chinensis to C. lunata and B. sorokiniana. This study first verified that the endophytes in A. sibiricum have a positive effect on disease resistance of neighbor grasses to brown patch. The study contributes to the understanding of endophyte-host interactions and suggests potential applications of endophytes in biological control strategies for grassland management.","Shi, XJ; Zhang, JX; Qin, TZ; Liu, JM; Gao, YB; Ren, AZ",ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,2024,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2024.105952,0.970771557623237,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999922110975644,7.78890243558635e-5,0.999999838596384,1.61403616250055e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Copper sulfide-sepiolite composite (SP-CuS NC) nanoplatform was developed as seed treatment agent to control seed borne fungal pathogen as well to increase the seed quality parameters after application during storage. Copper sulfide-sepiolite nanocomposite (SP-CuS NC) was prepared sonochemically by in situ synthesis of copper sulfide in aqueous media containing dispersed activated sepiolite.

Results from application of nano composite on freshly harvested paddy seeds at different active concentrations of copper sulfide (ranging from 20 to 500 mu g/g) when packed in cotton bags for storage indicated the efficacy of such nano-enabled natural silicate material for seed storage approach due to the restricted delivery of copper at the right place without showing any sign of phytotoxicity. SP-CuS NC inflicted the promotion of seed germination, particularly in the diseased media conditions, which increased with the time of application as well as applied concentration.

Still, it is largely unknown what microbes and potential functions are involved in sustaining turfgrass, the major component of urban/suburban landscapes, under drought. We examined microbial responses to water deficits in bulk soil, rhizosphere, and root endosphere of bermudagrass by applying evapotranspiration (ET)-based dynamic irrigation twice per week during the growing season to create six treatments (0%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%, and 120% ET) and respective drought-stressed soil conditions. Bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed via marker gene amplicon sequencing and thereafter drought-reshaped potential functions of the bacterial community were projected. Slight yet significant microbial responses to irrigation treatments were observed in all three microhabitats. The root endophytic bacterial community was most responsive to water stress. No-irrigation primarily increased the relative abundance of root endophytic Actinobacteria, especially the genus Streptomyces. Irrigation at =40% ET increased the relative abundances of PICRUSt2-predicted functional genes encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase, superoxide dismutase, and chitinase in root endosphere.

7430,Identification and characterization of type III polyketide synthase genes from culturable endophytes of ethnomedicinal plants,"Endophytic fungi provide benefits to host plants by producing a diverse class of secondary metabolites (natural products). Arrays of polyketide natural products are synthesized by specific classes of polyketide synthases (PKS I, II and III) in host organisms. In the present study, we attempt to screen and identify type HI PKSs in culturable fungal endophytes isolated from the ethno medicinal plants including Arbus precatorius, Bacopa monnieri,Citrus aurantifolia and Datura metel to detect the genetic potential of endophytic fungi in producing bioactive compounds. A total of seventeen endophytic fungal strains belonging to eight genera were identified using fungal morphology and rDNA-ITS phylogenetic analyses. A CODEHOP-PCR based strategy was followed to design degenerate primers for the screening of type III PKS genes from fungal endophytes. We had successfully amplified partial PKS genes from eight endophytes. The amplified PKS sequences showed 60-99% identity to already characterized/putative PKS genes. From the partial sequence of FiPKS from Fusarium incarnatum BMER1, a full-length gene was amplified, cloned and characterized.

18697,Genomics of plant-associated fungi: Research progress and highlights in forage crops.,"Plant-associated fungi are fungal groups that exhibit different interactions with plants such as symbiosis (mycorrhizae), antagonistic (pathogenic) and beneficial (biocontrol), and commensal relationships. Since the publication of the first fungal genome sequence of the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe grisea in 2005, a new chapter in the genome exploration of plant-associated fungi has been initiated. Research in past decades showed about 1385 sequenced fungal genomes associated with plants. These genomes are linked with grain crops (e.g., wheat, rice), cash crops (e.g., soybean, cotton), and forage crops (e.g., alfalfa). The reported functional groups associated with plants include pathogens, endophytes, mycorrhizal fungi and saprotrophs. For the categories of plant-associated fungi based on functional groups, pathogenic fungi were the dominant group with a distribution of 96 %, followed by endophytes (2 %) and other fungi with unclear roles (2 %). For the categories of plant-associated fungi based on crop host, only 3.5 % of sequenced genomes is associated with forage crops compared with 67 % for food and cash crops. Based on the number of sequenced genomes, Fusarium belongs to the top one ranked fungal genus with wheat as the top one ranked crop host.

3819,Assessing Genotypic and Environmental Effects on Endophyte Communities of Fraxinus (Ash) Using Culture Dependent and Independent DNA Sequencing,"Fraxinus excelsior populations are in decline due to the ash dieback disease Hymenoscyphus fraxineus. It is important to understand genotypic and environmental effects on its fungal microbiome to develop disease management strategies. To do this, we used culture dependent and culture independent approaches to characterize endophyte material from contrasting ash provenances, environments, and tissues (leaves, roots, seeds). Endophytes were isolated and identified using nrITS, LSU, or tef DNA loci in the culture dependent assessments, which were mostly Ascomycota and assigned to 37 families. Few taxa were shared between roots and leaves. The culture independent approach used high throughput sequencing (HTS) of nrITS amplicons directly from plant DNA and detected 35 families. Large differences were found in OTU diversity and community composition estimated by the contrasting approaches and these data need to be combined for estimations of the core endophyte communities. Species richness and Shannon index values were highest for the leaf material and the French population. Few species were shared between seed and leaf tissue. PCoA and NMDS of the HTS data showed that seed and leaf microbiome communities were highly distinct and that there was a strong influence of Fraxinus species identity on their fungal community composition. The results will facilitate a better understanding of ash fungal ecology and are a step toward identifying microbial biocontrol systems to minimize the impact of the disease.","Lahiri, A; Murphy, BR; Hodkinson, TR",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2021,10.3390/jof7070565,0.992037475918278,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.902005000348717,0.0979949996512831,0.999279911885555,7.2008811444479e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1430,Disease risk of the foliar endophyte Colletotrichum from invasive Ageratina adenophora to native plants and crops,"The disease risk driven by foliar fungi asymptomatically infecting invasive plants has rarely been determined. In this study, we selected 44 foliar Colletotrichum endophytes isolated from the invasive plant Ageratina adenophora that are phylogenetically closely related to the C. gloeosporioides complex, C. boninense complex, C. orchidearum complex, and C. acutatum complex and evaluated their potential virulence and ability to transmit spores to native plants and cash crops both in vitro and in vivo. We verified that some foliar endophyte Colletotrichum strains adversely affect the leaf and seed germination of native plants and cash crops. Some strains reduce the growth and yield of tomato (SL) (Solanum lycopersicum) and pepper (CA) (Capsicum annuum) plants and even cause the death of strawberry (FA) plants (Fragaria ananassa). Moreover, we confirmed that A. adenophora leaves could horizontally transmit Colletotrichum to surrounding crop plants in vivo. Therefore, a high abundance of Colletotrichum asymptomatically associated with A. adenophora leaves might increase disease risk in surrounding native plants and cash crops. Our results provide a new perspective for regional ecological risk assessment of invasive plants and prevention of economic plant diseases in the invaded range.","Yang, AL; Chen, YS; Mei, L; Guo, J; Zhang, HB",FUNGAL ECOLOGY,2024,10.1016/j.funeco.2024.101386,0.994955685015143,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.988148397378313,0.0118516026216873,0.999992318209201,7.68179079913001e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
7329,"Enhancing dendrobine production in Dendrobium nobile through mono-culturing of endophytic fungi, Trichoderma longibrachiatum (MD33) in a temporary immersion bioreactor system","Introduction Dendrobine, a valuable alkaloid found in Dendrobium nobile, possesses significant pharmaceutical potential. Methods In this study, we explored innovative approaches to enhance dendrobine production by utilizing endophytic fungi in a Temporary Immersion Bioreactor System (TIBS, Nanjing BioFunction Co. Ltd., China) and traditional test bottles. Dendrobine was unequivocally identified and characterised in D. nobile co-culture seedlings through UHPLC analysis and LC-MS qTOF analysis, supported by reference standards. Results The CGTB (control group) and EGTB (experimental group) 12-month-old D. nobile seedlings exhibited similar peak retention times at 7.6 +/- 0.1 minutes, with dendrobine identified as C16H25NO2 (molecular weight 264.195). The EGTB, co-cultured with Trichoderma longibrachiatum (MD33), displayed a 2.6-fold dendrobine increase (1804.23 ng/ml) compared to the CGTB (685.95 ng/ml). Furthermore, a bioanalytical approach was applied to investigate the mono-culture of T. longibrachiatum MD33 with or without D. nobile seedlings in test bottles. The newly developed UHPLC-MS method allowed for dendrobine identification at a retention time of 7.6 +/- 0.1 minutes for control and 7.6 +/- 0.1 minutes for co-culture. Additionally, we explored TIBS to enhance dendrobine production. Co-culturing D. nobile seedlings with Trichoderma longibrachiatum (MD33) in the TIBS system led to a substantial 9.7-fold dendrobine increase (4415.77 ng/ml) compared to the control (454.01 ng/ml) after just 7 days. The comparative analysis of dendrobine concentration between EGTB and EGTIBS highlighted the remarkable potential of TIBS for optimizing dendrobine production. Future research may focus on scaling up the TIBS approach for commercial dendrobine production and investigating the underlying mechanisms for enhanced dendrobine biosynthesis in D. nobile. The structural elucidation of dendrobine was achieved through H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy, revealing a complex array of proton environments and distinct carbon environments, providing essential insights for the comprehensive characterization of the compound. Discussion These findings hold promise for pharmaceutical and industrial applications of dendrobine and underline the role of endophytic fungi in enhancing secondary metabolite production in medicinal plants.","Sarsaiya, S; Jain, A; Shu, FX; Yang, MF; Pu, MX; Jia, Q; Gong, QH; Wu, Q; Qian, X; Shi, JS; Chen, JS",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2024,10.3389/fpls.2024.1302817,0.985926977568843,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998857755339649,0.0011422446603505,0.999999995708153,4.2918474330022605e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

10397,Functional Characterization of a Hexose Transporter from Root Endophyte Piriformospora indica,"Understanding the mechanism of photosynthate transfer at symbiotic interface by fungal monosaccharide transporter is of substantial importance. The carbohydrate uptake at the apoplast by the fungus is facilitated by PiHXT5 hexose transporter in root endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica. The putative PiHXT5 belongs to MFS superfamily with 12 predicted transmembrane helices. It possess sugar transporter PFAM motif (PF0083) and MFS superfamily domain (PS50850). It contains the signature tags related to glucose transporter GLUT1 of human erythrocyte. PiHXT5 is regulated in response to mutualism as well as glucose concentration. We have functionally characterized PiHXT5 by complementation of hxt-null mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae EBY.VW4000. It is involved in transport of multiple sugars ranging from D-glucose, D-fructose, D-xylose, D-mannose, D-galactose with decreasing affinity. The uncoupling experiments indicate that it functions as H+/glucose co-transporter. Further, pH dependence analysis suggests that it functions maximum between pH 5 and 6. The expression of PiHXT5 is dependent on glucose concentration and was found to be expressed at low glucose levels (1 mM) which indicate its role as a high affinity glucose transporter. Our study on this sugar transporter will help in better understanding of carbon metabolism and flow in this agro-friendly fungus.","Rani, M; Raj, S; Dayaman, V; Kumar, M; Dua, M; Johri, AK",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2016,10.3389/fmicb.2016.01083,0.983374086357976,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.86516160376419,0.13483839623581,0.999989184021649,1.08159783509532e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

6305,Endophytic fungi harbored in Cannabis sativa L.: diversity and potential as biocontrol agents against host plant-specific phytopathogens,"The objective of the present work was isolation, phylogenetic characterization, and assessment of biocontrol potential of endophytic fungi harbored in various tissues (leaves, twigs, and apical and lateral buds) of the medicinal plant, Cannabis sativa L. A total of 30 different fungal endophytes were isolated from all the plant tissues which were authenticated by molecular identification based on rDNA ITS sequence analysis (ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 regions). The Menhinick's index revealed that the buds were immensely rich in fungal species, and Camargo's index showed the highest tissue-specific fungal dominance for the twigs. The most dominant species was Penicillium copticola that could be isolated from the twigs, leaves, and apical and lateral buds. A detailed calculation of Fisher's log series index, Shannon diversity index, Simpson's index, Simpson's diversity index, and Margalef's richness revealed moderate overall biodiversity of C. sativa endophytes distributed among its tissues. The fungal endophytes were challenged by two host phytopathogens, Botrytis cinerea and Trichothecium roseum, devising a dual culture antagonistic assay on five different media. We observed 11 distinct types of pathogen inhibition encompassing a variable degree of antagonism (%) on changing the media. This revealed the potential chemodiversity of the isolated fungal endophytes not only as promising resources of biocontrol agents against the known and emerging phytopathogens of Cannabis plants, but also as sustainable resources of biologically active and defensive secondary metabolites.","Kusari, P; Kusari, S; Spiteller, M; Kayser, O",FUNGAL DIVERSITY,2013,10.1007/s13225-012-0216-3,0.973722192315776,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999920265322328,7.97346776720521e-5,0.999999999995827,4.17310630496104e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
14353,Metabolites Diversity and Hydrocarbons Analysis on Volatile Organic Compounds Produced by Ascocoryne Strains,"Objective: Endophytic fungus Ascocoryne sarcoides NRRL 50072 was firstly found to be able to produce volatile compounds similar to those in fossil fuels. This could be a new avenue to biofuel development. The purpose of this study is to clarify whether the other strains from the same species or related species in Ascocoryne have similar metabolisms to produce biofuel compounds. Method: Different strains from Ascocoryne were isolated with tissue-surface sterilization. The evolutionary relationship between the strains in the genus was determined through constituting a ML phylogenetic tree. The compounds in volatile gas from the strains were analyzed and identified in NIST database with HSSPEM-GC-MS. Result: All the strains studied were able to produce volatile metabolites containing hydrocarbons, alcohols, esters, aldehydes, acids, etc. However, the volatile compounds among the strains were highly diverse, even among closely related strains with significantly different compositions in their volatile compounds. Conclusion: Most fungi from Ascocoryne could have the capability to produce volatile hydrocarbons. The compounds of hydrocarbons may be strain-specific. Therefore, it is fundamental for discovering or genetic engineering new strains to study and develop myco-diesel from Ascocoryne fungi. © 2017, Chinese Academy of Forestry.

Methods: In the present study the DNA was isolated and the ITS region of 5.8s rRNA was amplified using specific primers ITS 1 and ITS4 and sequence was determined using automated sequencers. Blast search sequence similarity was found against the existing non redundant nucleotide sequence database thus, identified as Aspergilus flavus, Hyporcaea lixii, Aspergillus niger, Eutorium amstelodami, Irpex hydnoides and Neurospora crassa. Among the seven isolates, one fungi Irpex hydnoides was selected for further studies. The fungi were grown in sabouraud broth for five days and filtrate were separated and subjected to ethyl acetate for further studies. Results: Nearly half (49.25%) of the extracts showed activity (IC50 of 125 μg/mL).

10633,Modulation of volatile production in strawberries fruits by endophytic fungi: Insights into modulation of the ester's biosynthetic pathway under drought condition,"Strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa) are valued worldwide for their aroma among other quality traits. Pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) is a key enzyme in aroma, initiating the conversion of pyruvate into acetaldehyde. This process produces precursors for esters and aromatic compounds that enhance strawberry aroma. Additionally, alcohol acyltransferases (AATs) are essential for catalyzing acyl group transfers, further enriching fruit aroma diversity. However, strawberries are highly vulnerable to drought, which affects product quality. Plant rootassociated fungi offer a novel approach to mitigate water deficiency stress. This study investigates the effect of Antarctic fungal inoculation on the gene expression of FaPDC, and the FaAAT gene family, related to the accumulation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in strawberries. Fruits of fungi-inoculated plants under drought stress showed significant changes in gene expression, leading to increased total volatile ester production, primarily in acetate esters, which are important for strawberry aroma. These findings underscore the role of Antarctic fungi in modulating the metabolic pathway of volatile esters by inducing the expression of FaPDC and FaAAT genes. Beyond elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying aromatic compound biosynthesis in fruits, this study highlights the potential of Antarctic microorganisms as valuable tools to restore and maintain the sensory attributes of agricultural products under water deficiency stress.","Rodríguez-Arriaza, F; Cortiella, MGI; Pollmann, S; Morales-Quintana, L; Ramos, P",PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY,2025,10.1016/j.plaphy.2024.109347,0.988276378826155,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.962597753903136,0.0374022460968645,0.99999874300056,1.25699944009128e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
7448,First Inventory of Fungi in Symptomless and Symptomatic Chinese Mesona Indicates Phytopathological Threat,"Chinese mesona (Platostoma palustre) plays an important role as special crop in Southeast Asia and Taiwan for the production of herbal tea, grass jelly, and further processed food. In order to assess the potential threat of fungi to Chinese mesona, we surveyed isolates from symptomless plants in the area of mesona production, as well as from leaf spots of potted plants in a garden shop and a plantation in a botanical garden in Taiwan. From leaves, stems, and roots of 15 symptomless plants sampled at five collection events over two years, 154 isolates from 810 surface- sterilized plant fragments were obtained and identified based on DNA sequence data of the internal transcribed spacer region, and partially of the b-tubulin and histone H3 genes. The most common species belonged to the genera Cercospora, Colletotrichum, and Fusarium and were considered to be potential plant pathogens. Latent pathogenicity was confirmed by an infection experiment with an endophytic strain of Corynespora cassiicola. Observation of leaf spot disease associated with Cercospora kikuchii suggested pathogenicity of this fungus, which was also isolated as an endophyte from symptomless leaves. We hypothesize that the most common endophytic fungi are latent pathogens in the host and may cause plant disease when the host becomes weakened by senescence or changed cultivation condition. Leaf spots of plants in the botanical garden were associated with a species of Pseudocercospora, which was not found among the endophytic isolates and is newly described based on morphology and analysis of translation elongation factor 1 alpha gene sequences.","Hsieh, CW; Chuang, YY; Lee, MZ; Kirschner, R",PLANT DISEASE,2020,10.1094/PDIS-03-20-0475-RE,0.679644633203765,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999982130816815,1.78691831852294e-5,0.999999999998985,1.01540997832217e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
3466,Reinfestation of endophtye-infected tall fescue in renovated endophyte-free pastures under rotational stocking,"Endophyte-infected (E+) tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) S.J. Darbyshire] is problematic in pastures because it produces alkaloids that can be toxic to cattle (Bos taurus). Replacement of E + tall fescue pasture with endophyte-free (E -) fescue may effectively eliminate this problem. Endophyte-free cultivars, however, are less competitive than E+ fescue and are usually displaced over time. The main objective of this study was to determine whether E + fescue would reinfest pastures planted with mixtures of E- fescue and other species and grazed under rotational stocking. In 2001, nine tall fescue pastures in western Illinois were renovated and planted with mixtures that contained E- fescue (Barcel) and two, four, or seven additional species. Pastures were grazed by beef cattle over 3 yr. Tall fescue tillers were collected each September and subjected to microscopic analysis for endophyte presence. After renovation, E + still accounted for 18 to 38% of tall fescue. Relative to all other species, however, E+ fescue was < 10% of pasture communities. The species mixtures sown with E- fescue had little influence on E+ fescue reinfestation (P = 0.70). Contrary to other studies, percentage of E+ fescue in E- pastures did not increase in the 3 yr of this study. Moderate grazing pressure under rotational stocking combined with relatively wet growing seasons likely favored E- fescue and suppressed E+ reinfestation. We also suggest that if pasture renovation can reduce E+ fescue percentage to < 10%, it is unlikely that E+ fescue will reinfest pastures to an extent that may cause fescue toxicosis in cattle.","Tracy, BF; Renne, IJ",AGRONOMY JOURNAL,2005,10.2134/agronj2004.0304,0.94055996458588,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.935021525122339,0.0649784748776608,0.999993942806597,6.05719340307509e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2008,Vegetative Hyphal Fusion and Subsequent Nuclear Behavior in Epichloe Grass Endophytes,"Epichloe species (including the former genus Neotyphodium) are fungal symbionts of many agronomically important forage grasses, and provide their grass hosts with protection from a wide range of biotic and abiotic stresses. Epichloe species include many interspecific hybrids with allodiploid-like genomes, which may provide the potential for combined traits or recombination to generate new traits. Though circumstantial evidence suggests that such interspecific hybrids might have arisen from nuclear fusion events following vegetative hyphal fusion between different Epichloe strains, this hypothesis has not been addressed empirically. Here, we investigated vegetative hyphal fusion and subsequent nuclear behavior in Epichloe species. A majority of Epichloe strains, especially those having a sexual stage, underwent self vegetative hyphal fusion. Vegetative fusion also occurred between two hyphae from different Epichloe strains. Though Epichloe spp. are uninucleate fungi, hyphal fusion resulted in two nuclei stably sharing the same cytoplasm, which might ultimately lead to nuclear fusion. In addition, protoplast fusion experiments gave rise to uninucleate putative hybrids, which apparently had two markers, one from each parent within the same nucleus. These results are consistent with the notion that interspecific hybrids arise from vegetative hyphal fusion. However, we also discuss additional factors, such as post-hybridization selection, that may be important to explain the recognized prevalence of hybrids in Epichloe species.","Shoji, JY; Charlton, ND; Yi, MH; Young, CA; Craven, KD",PLOS ONE,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0121875,0.958892987741912,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999521785688186,4.7821431181387e-4,0.999999998073473,1.92652671593407e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
21024,Endophytic bacteria of artemisia as biological control agent for cercospora leaf spot in paddy,"The problem of Cercospora janseana attacks that causes narrow brown spots in rice needs to be considered. Control of pathogens with fungicides is not environmentally-friendly. Alternative controls using biological control agents such as endophytic bacteria need to be assessed. This study aimed at determining the antagonism ability of artemisia endophytic bacteria towards C. janseana at in vitro and in vivo tests. The research methods included the isolation of endophytic bacteria from the leaves of Artemisia annua, pathogenicity test through hypersensitivity reactions, KOH test, identification of morphology and cell shape of endophytic bacteria and inhibitory test in vivo of endophytic bacteria. Five endophytic bacteria were successfully isolated. BEA12 had the highest inhibitory ability at antagonism in vitro test. Abnormal hyphae such as swelling hyphae like chlamydospore formed in C. janseana with BEA5 and BEA12 treatment also curling hyphae formed in C. janseana with BEA2 treatment indicated that endophytic bacteria produced secondary metabolite compound or antibiotic. BEA4 was not able to inhibit C. janseana at antagonism in vitro test but, it had disease inhibition ability at in vivo test. Inhibition mechanism of C. janseana by endophytic bacteria was through secondary metabolite compound or antibiotic production, or inducing host resistance. The effectiveness of diseases inhibition by endophytic bacteria was fluctuated. © 2019, Agri. Bio. Publishers.

Consequently, improving plants' adaptive response to abiotic stress is a key goal to ensure agricultural productivity in these regions. In this study we developed a new methodology, using both area-based comparison and soil water content measurements of individual non-irrigated and irrigated clones, to assess performance of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) genotypes subjected to moisture stress in a simulated competitive environment. We applied this method to the evaluation of a full-sibling population from a pair cross between genotypes from a New Zealand cultivar and a Moroccan ecotype. Our hypothesis was that: (i) both leaf lamina regrowth after defoliation (LR) and plant vigour affect plant performance during drought and rehydration; and (ii) quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with plant performance under moisture stress could be identified. Differences amongst genotypes in dry matter (DM) production, early vigour at establishment, leaf elongation rate and LR were measured. LR explained most of the variation in DM production during exposure to moisture deficit and rehydration followed by plant vigour, indicated by initial DM production in both treatments and subsequent measures of DM production of irrigated clones. We identified two main QTL regions associated with DM production and LR, both during drought exposure and rehydration. Further research focused on these regions should improve our understanding of the genetic control of drought response in this forage crop and potentially other grass species with significant synteny, and support improvement in performance through molecular breeding approaches.","Hatier, JHB; Faville, MJ; Hickey, MJ; Koolaard, JP; Schmidt, J; Carey, BL; Jones, CS",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,2014,10.1093/jxb/eru318,0.976608271988882,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996574021528,0.00342597847199985,0.999999776136345,2.23863654613687e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

18167,A Bacterial Endophyte from Apoplast Fluids Protects Canola Plants from Different Phytopathogens via Antibiosis and Induction of Host Resistance.,"Endophytic bacteria colonize inner plant tissues and thrive at the apoplast, which is considered its main reservoir. Because this niche is the place where the main molecular events take place between beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms, the aim of this work was to characterize culturable endophytic bacteria from apoplastic fluids obtained from field-grown canola leaves and analyze their potential for biological control of diseases caused by Xanthomonas campestris, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and Leptosphaeria maculans. Dual-culture analysis indicated that three isolates (Apo8, Apo11, and Apo12) were able to inhibit the growth of all three phytopathogens. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA and rpoD genes of these isolates revealed that they are closely related to Pseudomonas viridiflava. One of the isolates, Apo11, was able to diminish the propagation of X. campestris in whole-plant assays. At the same time, Apo11 inoculation reduced the necrotic lesions provoked by S. sclerotiorum on canola leaves. This protective effect might be due to the induction of resistance in the host mediated by salicylic and jasmonic acid signaling pathways or the production of compounds with antimicrobial activity. At the same time, Apo11 inoculation promoted canola plant growth. Thus, the isolate characterized in this work has several desirable characteristics, which make it a potential candidate for the formulation of biotechnological products to control plant diseases or promote plant growth.",Romero FM; Rossi FR; Gárriz A; Carrasco P; Ruíz OA,Phytopathology,2019,10.1094/PHYTO-07-18-0262-R,0.686684302585621,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.918713228578188,0.0812867714218119,0.999963305353666,3.66946463342677e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
16181,Interactions between plant communities and soil microbial communities in the aggregate spray-seeding restoration area of Changqin Island,"As global eco-environmental issues have aroused increasing concern, ecological restoration has become a key research topic. As an emerging technology for ecological restoration, aggregate spray-seeding offers significant advantages in vegetation restoration. [Objective] To reveal the relationship between plant community assembly and soil microbial communities during the aggregate spray-seeding restoration process. [Methods] A comprehensive investigation was conducted at plots of various seeding batches on the slopes of Changqin Island in Zhuhai City, focusing on the internal relationships of the structures of pioneer plant communities with soil nutrient content and characteristics of soil fungal and bacterial communities. [Results] The soil fungal community in the aggregate spray-seeding restoration area of Changqin Island was mainly composed of 9 phyla, among which Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were dominant. The soil bacterial community was dominated by Pseudomonadota, Acidobacteriota, and Bacteroidota. The soil fungi of plant pathogens, wood saprotrophs, and endophytes exhibited high abundance, while a large proportion of bacteria were involved in nitrogen cycling. Using the support vector machine method, we identified 24 soil microbial and nutrient indicators related to differences across aggregate spray-seeding batches. The cluster analysis classified the main restoration plants into two groups and the 24 soil-microbial and nutrient indicators into four categories. The inter-group correlation analysis showed significant associations of plant combinations with soil microbial and nutrient indicators. [Conclusion] Substantial differences in community structure and diversity are observed among different aggregate spray-seeding batches. Plant community assembly significantly influences the structures and functions of soil microbial communities. The findings of this study provide essential theoretical support for ecological restoration practices, contributing to the optimization of restoration strategies and enhancing ecosystem stability and sustainability. © 2025, Acta Microbiologica Sinica Editorial Office.

16019,Mitigating maize stalk rot disease: harnessing Bacillus subtilis PM57 and Bacillus cereus PM38 as biocontrol allies against Erwinia carotovora,"Maize bacterial stalk rot, caused by Erwinia carotovora pv. zeae (EC) is a significant threat to maize production, and applicable biocontrol measures are lacking. This study aims to identify a potent biocontrol agent against Erwinia carotovora and enhance plant growth under stress conditions. Thirty strains were screened using the agar plate well diffusion method. Strains PM57 and PM38 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity, forming inhibition zones of 5.0 and 4.51 mm, while distilled water served as a control with no inhibition. Their cell-free supernatants (CFSs) also demonstrated strong antagonistic activity with the maximum inhibition zones of 7.0 and 5.5 mm. The minimum inhibitory concentration of cell-free supernatants from both strains was 50 μg/ml. PM57 was identified as Bacillus subtilis via 16S rRNA gene sequencing. FTIR analysis revealed functional groups, including sulfonates, carbohydrates, proteins, and polyphenols in PM38, while PM57 exhibited peaks related to C-N stretching and aliphatic primary amine. GC-MS analysis identified twenty-six bioactive compounds known for their biological and medicinal properties, including tert-butyl phenol compounds, hydrocarbons, aldehydes, benzoquinones, pyrroles, and terpenes. Both inoculants produced volatile metabolites that effectively inhibited Erwinia carotovora growth in vitro. A greenhouse study revealed that PM57 reduced stalk rot disease incidence by 76.83 %, while PM38 reduced it by 74.94 %. The application of both inoculants enhanced chlorophyll activity; PM57 increased plant-growth by 11 %, and PM38 by 6 % and improved pathogen stress tolerance in maize seedlings compared to the positive control. These results demonstrate the potential of PM57 and PM38 as effective biocontrol agents for sustainable maize cultivation. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",Ullah G.; Nisar M.; Rehman F.U.; Paree paker N.; Hussain Munis M.F.; Chaudhary H.J.,Microbial Pathogenesis,2025,10.1016/j.micpath.2025.107556,0.905881716300853,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.946258664974803,0.0537413350251967,0.999999832213782,1.67786218474575e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

12177,PLANT GROWTH PROMOTING ENDOPHYTIC YEAST GEOTRICHUM CANDIDUM (JX 477426) FROM ROOTS OF BRUGUIERA CYLINDRICA,"Dynamic mangrove ecosystems are fascinating sources of microorganisms which serve as an extraordinary habitat for the growth and development of many endophytic microorganisms. In this study, we isolated 16 endophytic fungi thriving in the mangrove species Bruguiera cylindrica, collected from Ayiramthengu in the state of Kerala, India. All the isolated endophytes were screened for their plant growth promoting activities (IAA, siderophore and HCN production, ACC deaminase activity) and enzyme production. Among the isolates, seven displayed only a single trait from the total plant growth promoting traits evaluated, although IAA production was a common trait observed amongst the lot. When IAA concentration was quantified in the culture medium, the isolate MEF 21 showed the highest IAA production (>45 mu g/mL). The ability of MEF 21 isolate to produce IAA, both in the presence and absence of L-Tryptophan was confirmed by TLC and GC-MS analysis. The isolate also produced siderophores and displayed ACC deaminase activity. The fungus exhibited high extracellular enzyme activity such as amylase, cellulase and protease. Vigna radiata seeds were treated with culture filtrates of MEF 21 to determine its plant growth promoting ability by vigor index method. A germination percentage of 93% and a vigor index of 337.59 were displayed by MEF 21 alone. In vitro antagonistic activity was also exhibited by MEF 21 against the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris with a growth inhibition zone of 35 +/- 1.5 mm diameter in the dual culture plate. This efficient plant growth promoting isolate, MEF 21, was further identified using morphological, biochemical and phylogenetic methods. Molecular identification included ITS-PCR utilizing universal primers. The PCR products were sequenced and submitted to GenBank. The isolate thus identified was Geotrichum candidum with an accession number JX 477426. These findings revealed the efficacy of the endophytic yeast, isolated from the surface sterilized root of the mangrove plant, to promote plant growth, development and protection.","George, TK; SubaidaBeevi, S; Asok, AK; Shaikmoideen, JM",JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY BIOTECHNOLOGY AND FOOD SCIENCES,2019,10.15414/jmbfs.2019.9.2.267-272,0.906791396525525,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.989216310440838,0.0107836895591622,0.99999849304227,1.50695773015741e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Wang, Nagao & Kakish) Pryor, Creamer, Shoemaker, McLain-Romero, & Hambleton found within toxic locoweeds (Astragalus and Oxytropis spp.) produces the alkaloid swainsonine, which is responsible for locoism in grazing animals. We sought to determine the location of U. oxytropis within locoweed seed, develop endophyte free plants, and assess the influence of environmental stresses on locoweed and endophyte cultures. Undifilum was identified within the parenchyma layers in seeds of Astragalus lentiginosus M.E. Jones using light microscopy and polymerase chain reaction. Astragalus lentiginosus and Oxytropis sericea Nutt. seedlings produced in embryo culture without seed coats did not contain swainsonine or fungus. Plants produced from whole seed contained U. oxytropis in both foliage and root tissues. When the in-vitro cultured plants of O. sericea and U. oxytropis cultures were subjected to environmental stresses including high temperature, low and high pH media, nutrient deficient media, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) amended media to simulate water deficit, both dry mass and swainsonine levels were affected. Swainsonine levels were greatest for O. sericea and Undifilum cultures in PEG or hydrochloric acid amended media. Plants grown in PEG-amended media had significantly greater dry mass, while Undifilum grown in PEG-amended media had lower dry mass than other treatments.","Oldrup, E; McLain-Romero, J; Padilla, A; Moya, A; Gardner, D; Creamer, R",BOTANY,2010,10.1139/B10-026,0.948125496314235,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.927489558902498,0.0725104410975023,0.999999861117205,1.38882794820105e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

5336,"Siderophores, a potential phosphate solubilizer from the endophyte Streptomyces sp. CoT10, improved phosphorus mobilization for host plant growth and rhizosphere modulation","Available phosphorus (AP) deficiency in soil is an important limiting factor in agricultural and forestry production. Thus, microbes with high P mobilization capacity are of great concern, especially for acidic soil where most P is fixed by Fe. Camellia oleifera is a typical acidic soil-planted oil crop with a high status in forestry economic systems in China. In this study, Streptomyces sp. CoT10 was screened and identified from C. oleifera endophytes. CoT10 could effectively mobilize different P resources, particularly showing a high solubility of 72.49 mg L-1 for FePO4, and was prominent in the production of different siderophores. Here, we initially assumed and confirmed that the Fe-P mobilization function of CoT10 was directly mediated by its siderophores. Application of CoT10 in C. oleifera could benefit P fraction transformation by mobilizing insoluble P and Fe, thus improving 15.35% AP content in soil and promoting plant growth with high P and Fe acquisition. In addition, CoT10 inoculation improved microbial diversity, with the proportions of some dominant groups, such as Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes, obviously enriched by 21.32%, 7.93%, and 38.95%, respectively. In addition, redundancy analysis (RDA), network analysis and functional prediction indicated that CoT10 inocu-lation improved the microbial interactions in C. oleifera rhizosphere soil and balanced the soil microbial P-and Fe-related functional roles.

12593,"Role of fungal endophyte of tall fescue (Epichloe coenophiala) on water availability, wilting point and integral energy in texturally-different soils","Managing soil water and water uptake by plant roots is more crucial in the arid and semi-arid regions comparing to the other places. Beside the well-known plant available water (PAW) concept, integral energy (E-l) is recently suggested to quantify the energy required by plants for water uptake. A greenhouse study was conducted to examine the effect of aboveground fungal endophyte infection (Epichloe coenophiala) in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb. =Schedonorus arundinaceus and Lolium arundinaceum) on soil water availability indices such as PAW and E-l in six texturally-different soils. The PAW was calculated as the difference between field capacity, theta(FC) [at matric suction, h, of 100 or 330 hPa (1 hPa =0.1 kPa)] and permanent wilting point, theta(PWP) (nominal value at h of 15000 hPa or actual h value determined in the greenhouse experiment). The E-l was computed by integration of soil water retention curve (determined using undisturbed soil samples) over the nominal and actual PAW ranges. The results indicated that h(PWP), the matric suction at actual permanent wilting point, of tall fescue is considerably greater than the conventional value (i.e., 15000 hPa) and its value was greater in endophyte-infected (E+) plant associated soils compared to endophyte-free (E-) ones (27572 hPa/2757 kPa for E+ vs. 21780 hPa/2178 kPa for E-) and the difference was greater in the coarse- to medium-textured soils. Moreover, E+ treatments, especially in the coarse- and medium-textured soils, had greater values of actual PAW and El. This shows that E+ plants were able to tolerate higher h values at similar conditions presumably due to induced drought-tolerance mechanisms. The effect of endophyte presence on increment of PAW(actual) and E-l(actual) in comparison with nominal values was much more evident in the coarse- and medium textured soils. This indicates that the error in calculations of the PAW and E-l values by considering theta(PWP) at h= 15000 hPa is relatively smaller in fine-textured soils. Nevertheless, nominal E, values were lower for E+ treatments indicating that in similar PAW, the plant needed lower energy to take up water from the PAW range because endophyte presence can affect soil water release path in the PAW range. Greater contribution of structural pores to water retention in E+ plant associated soils compared to E ones was related to greater sub-critical water repellency and aggregate stability and better physical quality in E+ plant associated soils. It is concluded that the presence of endophyte in tall fescue, especially in coarse- and medium-textured soils, affects soil water release path, increases PAW and thereby might raise water productivity in drought periods.

14596,"Effects of Tricyclazole on Cadmium Tolerance and Accumulation Characteristics of a Dark Septate Endophyte (DSE), Exophiala pisciphila","Exophiala pisciphila is a cadmium-tolerant fungus, and produces 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene melanin which can be inhibited by tricyclazole. Tricyclazole at higher levels (20 and 40 μg mL-1) reduced the growth and sporulation of E. pisciphila, but toxicity was not observed at a low concentration (2.5 μg mL-1). Under cadmium (Cd) stress (50, 100 and 200 mg L-1), 2.5 μg mL-1 of tricyclazole reduced fungal growth and sporulation. These reduces indicated a decrease on Cd tolerance of E. pisciphila. For both the 0 and 2.5 μg mL-1 tricyclazole treatments, Cd was associated mostly with cell walls and was extracted by 2 % acetic acid and 1 M NaCl. The FTIR spectra of the E. pisciphila mycelia were similar for both 0 and 2.5 μg mL-1 tricyclazole treatments, which showed hydroxyl, amine, carboxyl and phosphate groups. Thus inhibition of melanin synthesis by tricyclazole did not change Cd accumulation characteristics in E. pisciphila. Results suggested that melanin played a protective role for E. pisciphila against Cd stress, but inhibition of melanin synthesis did not have a remarkable impact on Cd accumulation in E. pisciphila. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media.",Zhan F.; He Y.; Yang Y.; Li Y.; Li T.; Zhao Z.,Bulletin of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology,2016,10.1007/s00128-015-1676-4,0.980139562811316,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.834954149074779,0.165045850925221,0.999999763736275,2.36263725028607e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
11342,Fungal Endophyte Diversity and Bioactivity in the Indian Medicinal Plant Ocimum sanctum Linn,"Endophytic mycopopulation isolated from India's Queen of herbs Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) were explored and investigated for their diversity and antiphytopathogenic activity against widespread plant pathogens Botrytis cinerea, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium oxysporum. 90 fungal isolates, representing 17 genera were recovered from 313 disease-free and surface sterilised plant segments (leaf and stem tissues) from three different geographic locations (Delhi, Hyderabad and Mukteshwar) during distinct sampling times in consequent years 2010 and 2011 in India. Fungal endophytes were subjected to molecular identification based on rDNA ITS sequence analysis. Plant pathogens such as F. verticillioides, B. maydis, C. coarctatum, R. bataticola, Hypoxylon sp., Diaporthe phaseolorum, Alternaria tenuissima and A. alternata have occurred as endophyte only during second sampling (second sampling in 2011) in the present study. Bi-plot generated by principal component analysis suggested tissue specificity of certain fungal endophytes. Dendrogram revealed species abundance as a function of mean temperature of the location at the time of sampling. Shannon diversity in the first collection is highest in Hyderabad leaf tissues (H' = 1.907) whereas in second collection it was highest from leaf tissues of Delhi (H' = 1.846). Mukteshwar (altitude: 7500 feet) reported least isolation rate in second collection. Nearly 23% of the total fungal isolates were considered as potent biocontrol agent. Hexane extract of M. phaseolina recovered from Hyderabad in first collection demonstrated highest activity against S. sclerotiorum with IC50 value of 0.38 mg/ml. Additionally, its components 2H-pyran-2-one, 5,6-dihydro-6-pentyl and palmitic acid, methyl ester as reported by GC-MS Chromatogram upon evaluation for their antiphytopathogenic activity exhibited IC50 value of 1.002 and 0.662 against respectively S. sclerotiorum indicating their significant role in antiphytopathogenic activity of hexane extract.

19444,"Microbial Community, Metabolic Potential and Seasonality of Endosphere Microbiota Associated with Leaves of the Bioenergy Tree Paulownia elongata × fortunei.","The microbial structure and metabolic function of plant-associated endophytes play a key role in the ecology of various environments, including trees. Here, the structure and functional profiles of the endophytic bacterial community, associated with Paulownia elongata × fortunei, in correlation with seasonality, were evaluated using Biolog EcoPlates. Biolog EcoPlates was used to analyse the functional diversity of the microbiome. The total communities of leaf endophyte communities were investigated using 16S rRNA V5-V7 region amplicon deep sequencing via Illumina MiSeq. Community level physiological profiling (CLPP) analysis by the Biolog EcoPlate™ assay revealed that the carboxylic acids (19.67-36.18%) and amino acids (23.95-35.66%) were preferred by all by all communities, whereas amines and amides (0.38-9.46%) were least used. Seasonal differences in substrate use were also found. Based on the sequencing data, mainly phyla Proteobacteria (18.4-97.1%) and Actinobacteria (2.29-78.7%) were identified. A core microbiome could be found in leaf-associated endophytic communities in trees growing in different locations. This work demonstrates the application of Biolog EcoPlates in studies of the functional diversity of microbial communities in a niche other than soil and shows how it can be applied to the functional analyses of endomicrobiomes. This research can contribute to the popularisation of Biolog EcoPlates for the functional analysis of the endomicrobiome.

11072,"Isolation and characterization of Muscodor albus I-41.3s, a volatile antibiotic producing fungus","Muscodor albus is an endophytic fungus of tropical tree species that produces volatile organic compounds (VOC's) that have antibiotic activity. A new isolate of this organism has been obtained from a small, unidentified vine, generally used by the indigenous people of the Tesso Nilo region in Central Sumatra, Indonesia, to treat snakebites. This unique organism produces a number of VOC's not previously observed in other M. albus isolates including tetrohydofuran, 2-methyl furan; 2-butanone; aciphyllene, and large amounts of an unusual azulene derivative. Noticeably absent from the VOC mixture was 1-butanol, 3-methyl-. Scanning electron micrographs of the organism showed a unique fishnet-like deposit of what appears to be a biopolymer covering the hyphae. The ITS-5.8S rDNA partial sequence data showed 99% identity to the original M. albus strain cz-620. In addition, an artificial mixture of some of the VOC's produced by this new isolate generally mimicked the inhibitory as well as lethal effects of the fungal VOC's on the test microorganisms. One of the most sensitive test fungi was Stachybotrys chartarum, an organism associated with the ""toxic mold"" syndrome of buildings. Fungi belonging to the Muscodor genus regularly appear in tropical rainforests throughout the world and these isolates appear to have chemical, biological, and structural characteristics that make them potentially useful in medicine, agricultural and industrial applications.

13532,Influence of consumption of endophyte-infested tall fescue hay on performance of heifers and lambs,"Two experiments were conducted to evaluate performance and physiological responses of heifers and lambs to Neotyphodium coenophialum-infested tall fescue hay fed under European rearing conditions. Endophyte-free (E-) or 100% endophyte-infested (E+) hay was derived from the same cultivar (cv. Clarine) so that the effect of the endophytic fungus could be clearly separated from a possible cultivar effect. In Exp. 1, starting in June 1996, 20 age- and body weight-paired Holstein dairy heifers were assigned for 97 d to one of two treatments consisting of ad libitum access to either E- or E+ hay, corresponding to 0 and .41 mg/ kg ergovaline, respectively. During the experimental period, no significant difference (P > .20) in forage consumption, rectal temperature, or behavioral status of the animals was observed between the two treatments. The E+ diet induced a 10% apparent decrease in ADG and a clear reduction in prolactin (PRL) plasma concentration compared to the E-diet. When animals were all reassigned to a common endophyte-free diet, the E+ group recovered body weight and PRL to levels similar to those in animals fed E-after 7 wk. In Exp. 2, 30 Texel ram lambs were assigned to two treatments consisting of dietary E- or E+ tall fescue hay. The E- and E+ hays were harvested from the same plots as used in Exp. 1 and contained 0 and .96 mg/kg ergovaline, respectively. No effect of the endophyte was found on intake or carcass or testicle weight (P > .20) after the 95-d feeding period. The E+ treatment resulted in a slight reduction in BW at slaughter, mainly explained by a lower ruminal fill (P < .01). In E+ treated animals, prolactin concentrations dropped significantly (P < .001) from d 27. Hay assessment in both experiments showed no difference in chemical composition and IVDMD. The endophytic fungus strongly lowered the palatability of the E+ hay, although there was no effect on intake with heifers (Exp. 1) or with lambs (Exp. 2). The potential of severe heat stress, as expressed by the temperature humidity index, was not high in our experimental conditions, although they were considered rather unusually stressful for the western part of northern Europe.

1103,Microbial impacts on plant-herbivore interactions: the indirect effects of a birch pathogen on a birch aphid,"The role of indirect interactions in structuring communities is becoming increasingly recognised. Plant fungi can bring about changes in plant chemistry which may affect insect herbivores that share the same plant, and hence the two may interact indirectly. This study investigated the indirect effects of a fungal pathogen (Marssonina betulae) of silver birch (Betula pendula) on an aphid (Euceraphis betulae), and the processes underpinning the interaction. There was a strong positive association between natural populations of the aphid and leaves bearing high fungal infection. In choice tests, significantly more aphids settled on leaves inoculated with the fungus than on asymptomatic leaves. Individual aphids reared on inoculated leaves were heavier, possessed longer hind tibiae and displayed enhanced embryo development compared with aphids reared on asymptomatic leaves; population growth rate was also positively correlated with fungal infection when groups of aphids were reared on inoculated branches. Changes in leaf chemistry were associated with fungal infection with inoculated leaves containing higher concentrations of free-amino acids. This may reflect a plant-initiated response to fungal attack in which free amino acids from the degradation of mesophyll cells are translocated out of infected leaves via the phloem. These changes in plant chemistry are similar to those occurring during leaf senescence, and are proposed as the mechanistic basis for the positive interaction between the fungus and aphid.","Johnson, SN; Douglas, AE; Woodward, S; Hartley, SE",OECOLOGIA,2003,10.1007/s00442-002-1139-6,0.99389959062583,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99969322095678,3.0677904321967e-4,0.999999999999913,8.71525074330748e-14,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

18062,Malassezia Is Associated with Crohn's Disease and Exacerbates Colitis in Mouse Models.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by alterations in the intestinal microbiota and altered immune responses to gut microbiota. Evidence is accumulating that IBD is influenced by not only commensal bacteria but also commensal fungi. We characterized fungi directly associated with the intestinal mucosa in healthy people and Crohn's disease patients and identified fungi specifically abundant in patients. One of these, the common skin resident fungus Malassezia restricta, is also linked to the presence of an IBD-associated polymorphism in the gene for CARD9, a signaling adaptor important for anti-fungal defense. M. restricta elicits innate inflammatory responses largely through CARD9 and is recognized by Crohn's disease patient anti-fungal antibodies. This yeast elicits strong inflammatory cytokine production from innate cells harboring the IBD-linked polymorphism in CARD9 and exacerbates colitis via CARD9 in mouse models of disease.

7446,Antifungal Activities of Volatile Secondary Metabolites of Four Diaporthe Strains Isolated from Catharanthus roseus,"Four endophytic fungi were isolated from the medicinal plant, Catharanthus roseus, and were identified as Diaporthe spp. with partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1), beta-tubulin (TUB), histone H3 (HIS), calmodulin (CAL) genes, and rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (TEF1-TUB-HIS-CAL-ITS) multigene phylogeny suggested for species delimitation in the Diaporthe genus. Each fungus produces a unique mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) with an abundant mixture of terpenoids analyzed by headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fiber-GC/MS. These tentatively-detected terpenes included alpha-muurolene, beta-phellandrene, gamma-terpinene, and alpha-thujene, as well as other minor terpenoids, including caryophyllene, patchoulene, cedrene, 2-carene, and thujone. The volatile metabolites of each isolate showed antifungal properties against a wide range of plant pathogenic test fungi and oomycetes, including Alternaria alternata, Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Fusarium graminearum, and Phytophthora cinnamomi. The growth inhibition of the pathogens varied between 10% and 60% within 72 h of exposure. To our knowledge, the endophytic Diaporthe-like strains are first reported from Catharanthus roseus.

75,Screening of Anti-Inflammatory Activity and Metabolomics Analysis of Endophytic Fungal Extracts; Identification and Characterization of Perylenequinones and Terpenoids from the Interesting Active Alternaria Endophyte,"Patients suffering from inflammatory chronic diseases are classically treated with anti-inflammatory drugs but unfortunately are highly susceptible to becoming resistant to their treatment. Finding new drugs is therefore crucial and urgent and research on endophytic fungi is a promising way forward. Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that colonize healthy plants and live within their intercellular tissues. They are able to produce a large variety of secondary metabolites while allowing their host to stay healthy. A number of these molecules are endowed with antioxidant or antimicrobial as well as cytotoxic properties, making them very interesting/promising in the field of human therapy. The aim of our study was to investigate whether extracts from five endophytic fungi isolated from plants are endowed with anti-inflammatory activity. Extracts of the endophytic fungi Alternaria alternata from Calotropis procera leaves and Aspergillus terreus from Trigonella foenum-graecum seeds were able to counteract the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pro-inflammatory effect on THP-1 cells differentiated into macrophages. Moreover, they were able to induce an anti-inflammatory state, rendering them less sensitive to the LPS pro-inflammatory stimulus. Taken together, these results show that these both endophytic fungi could be interesting alternatives to conventional anti-inflammatory drugs. To gain more detailed knowledge of their chemical richness, phytochemical analysis of the ethyl acetate extracts of the five endophytic fungi studied was performed using HPTLC, GC-MS and LC-MS with the Global Natural Products Social (GNPS) platform and the MolNetEnhancer tool. A large family of metabolites (carboxylic acids and derivatives, steroid derivatives, alkaloids, hydroxyanthraquinones, valerolactones and perylenequinones) were detected. The purification of endophytic fungus extract of Alternaria alternate, which diminished TNF-alpha production of 66% at 20 mu g/mL, incubated one hour before LPS addition, led to the characterization of eight pure compounds. These molecules are altertoxins I, II, III, tricycloalternarenes 3a, 1b, 2b, anthranilic acid, and o-acetamidobenzoic acid. In the future, all these pure compounds will be evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activity, while altertoxin II has been shown in the literature as the most active mycotoxin in terms of anti-inflammatory activity.","Spina, R; Ropars, A; Bouazzi, S; Dadi, S; Lemiere, P; Dupire, F; Khiralla, A; Yagi, S; Frippiat, JP; Laurain-Mattar, D",MOLECULES,2023,10.3390/molecules28186531,0.993178517554463,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.981524665593357,0.0184753344066425,0.999988863629383,1.11363706168932e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18608,"Surfactin, Iturin, and Fengycin Biosynthesis by Endophytic Bacillus sp. from Bacopa monnieri.","Endophytic microorganisms which are ubiquitously present in plants may colonize intracellularly or intercellularly without causing any diseases. By living within the unique chemical environment of a host plant, they produce a vast array of compounds with a wide range of biological activities. Because of this, natural products of endophytic origin have been exploited for antimicrobial, antiviral, anticancer, and antioxidant properties. Also, they can be considered to function as an efficient microbial barrier to protect plants from various pathogens. In the present study, endophytic bacterium BmB 9 with antifungal and antibacterial activity isolated from the stem tissue of Bacopa monnieri was studied for the molecular and chemical basis of its activity. PCR-based genome mining for various biosynthetic gene clusters proved the presence of surfactin, iturin, and type I polyketide synthase (PKS) genes in the isolate.

4934,Four-year biochar study: Positive response of acidic soil microenvironment and citrus growth to biochar under potassium deficiency conditions,"Biochar has direct or indirect effects on soil microorganisms, but the changes in soil metabolism are rarely monitored and analyzed. In addition, the potassium (K) effect of biochar has not attracted much attention. This study set up a four-year experiment with acid soil and citrus as the test soil and plants, respectively. The long-term effects of biochar on the acid soil microenvironment and citrus growth were explored from soil properties (nutrient contents, microbial com-munities, and metabolites) and citrus growth (nutrient contents, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and root endophytes). The results showed that the four-year amendment of biochar in acid soil was very significant, in which the soil pH was increased by 1 unit, organic matter and cation exchange capacity (CEC) increased by 120.77% and 16.21%, respec-tively. Biochar improved the K availability of soil by increasing the number and metabolic activity of Azotobacter and Pseudomonas, and finally effectively alleviated the K deficiency of citrus. From the perspective of available K con-tent, 2% biochar reduced the 20% conventional K application rate. The pH, organic matter, and cation exchange ca-pacity (CEC) were the most important factors affecting the bacterial community structure, while the fungal community was more sensitive to the change in the nutrient environment. Biochar mainly stimulated the progress of soil metabolism by affecting the metabolic activity of bacterial communities. Biochar application increased some of the beneficial bacteria in the soil, i.e., the relative abundance of Pseudarthrobacter increased by 700 times. However, biochar and exogenous K did not significantly affect arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and endophytic bacteria in citrus roots.

1895,Relative importance of fertiliser addition to plants and exclusion of predators for aphid growth in the field,"Herbivore dynamics and community structure are influenced both by plant quality and the actions of natural enemies. A factorial experiment manipulating both higher and lower trophic levels was designed to explore the determinants of colony growth of the aphid Aphis jacobaeae, a specialist herbivore on ragwort Senecio jacobaea. Potential plant quality was manipulated by regular addition of NPK-fertiliser and predator pressure was reduced by interception traps; the experiment was carried out at two sites. The size and persistence of aphid colonies were measured. Fertiliser addition affected plant growth in only one site, but never had a measurable effect on aphid colony growth. In both habitats the action of insect predators dominated, imposing strong and negative effects on aphid colony performance. Ants were left unmanipulated in both sites and their performance on the aphid colonies did not significantly differ between sites or between treatments. Our results suggest that, at least for aphid herbivores on S. jacobaea, the action of generalist insect predators appears to be the dominant factor affecting colony performance and can under certain conditions even improve plant productivity.","Müller, CB; Fellowes, MDE; Godfray, HCJ",OECOLOGIA,2005,10.1007/s00442-004-1795-9,0.864550555700394,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.864848385144094,0.135151614855906,0.990611658585214,0.00938834141478595,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
2711,Endophytic Capacity of Entomopathogenic Fungi in a Pasture Grass and Their Potential to Control the Spittlebug Mahanarva spectabilis (Hemiptera: Cercopidae),"Pests in pastures have compromised the production of biomass for feeding livestock herds. Many strategies have been applied to sustainably solve this problem. One viable and innovative technique is the delivery of entomopathogenic fungi through endophytes. Therefore, this study aimed to (i) evaluate the endophytic capacity of two entomopathogenic fungi, Fusarium multiceps UFMGCB 11443 and Metarhizium anisopliae UFMGCB 11444, in Urochloa brizantha [(Hochst. ex A. Rich.) Stapf] (Poaceae) cultivar 'Marundu') via foliar inoculation or seed treatment, and (ii) measure their efficiency in controlling Mahanarva spectabilis Distant, 1909 (Hemiptera: Cercopidae) in U. brizantha. In the greenhouse, the fungi colonized the tissues of U. brizantha plants when inoculated via foliar spraying or seed treatment. The fungi F. multiceps and M. anisopliae caused 88% and 97.1% epizootic effects via seed inoculation, respectively, and 100% epizootic effects via foliar inoculation. In the field, the lowest fungal dose of 0.5 kg/ha had the same effect as a fourfold greater dose, with a >86% decrease in insect pest infestation observed. In summary, the fungi F. multiceps and M. anisopliae have endophytic effects and can effectively control M. spectabilis in U. brizantha pastures.","Campagnani, MO; Auad, AM; Mauricio, RM; Madureira, AP; Cangussú, MA; Rosa, LH; Pereira, MFA; Muniz, M; Souza, SRO; Silva, NBM; Silva, ACR; Campos, WG",AGRONOMY-BASEL,2024,10.3390/agronomy14050943,0.944846969584613,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.96171844812502,0.0382815518749796,0.999972079373401,2.7920626599065e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12061,Biocontrol Activity of Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Against Botrytis cinerea and Other Cannabis Fungal Pathogens,"Gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea is one of the most widespread and damaging diseases in cannabis crops worldwide. With challenging restrictions on pesticide use and few effective control measures, biocontrol agents are needed to manage this disease. The aim of this study was to identify bacterial biocontrol agents with wide-spectrum activity against B. cinerea and other cannabis fungal pathogens. Twelve Bacillus and Pseudomonas strains were first screened with in vitro confrontational assays against 10 culturable cannabis pathogens, namely B. cinerea, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Fusarium culmorum, F. sporotrichoides, F. oxysporum, Nigrospora sphaerica, N. oryzae, Alternaria alternata, Phoma sp., and Cercospora sp. Six strains displaying the highest inhibitory activity, namely Bacillus velezensis LBUM279, FZB42, LBUM1082, Bacillus subtilis LBUM979, P. synxantha LBUM223, and P. protegens Pf-5, were further assessed in planta where all, except LBUM223, significantly controlled gray mold development on cannabis leaves. Notably, LBUM279 and FZB42 reduced disease severity by at least half compared with water-treated plants and prevented lesion development and/or sporulation up to 9 days after pathogen inoculation. Genomes of LBUM279, LBUM1082, and LBUM979 were sequenced de novo and taxonomic affiliations were determined to ensure nonrelatedness with pathogenic strains. Moreover, the genomes were exempt of detrimental genes encoding major toxins and virulence factors that could otherwise pose a biosafety risk when used on crops. Eighteen gene clusters of potential biocontrol interest were also identified. To our knowledge, this is the first reported attempt to control cannabis fungal diseases in planta by direct antagonism with beneficial bacteria.","Balthazar, C; Novinscak, A; Cantin, G; Joly, DL; Filion, M",PHYTOPATHOLOGY,2022,10.1094/PHYTO-03-21-0128-R,0.742786518649841,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.797189121048254,0.202810878951746,0.992233153327077,0.00776684667292282,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
10581,Controlled release of tebuconazole from a polymer matrix microparticle: Release kinetics and length of efficacy,"Preparation and characterization of microencapsulated tebuconazole, its release kinetics in water, and the bioefficacy of these formulations in controlling wheat rust in spring wheat is described herein. Control led-release (CR) formulations based on matrix microparticles were prepared by the oil-in-water emulsion process. Polymer-based matrix was prepared from poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(styrene-co-maleic anhydride) (PSMA). Modification of the matrix was achieved by the use of different low molecular weight or polymeric additives. These additives were found to lower the glass transition temperature of the matrix and enhance the release rate of tebuconazole in water, under infinite sink conditions. Release of tebuconazole from matrix microparticles was found to be diffusion controlled. CR formulations were found to be very efficacious in controlling wheat rust. Soil-applied CR formulations prepared from a PMMA or PSMA matrix, modified with poly(vinyl acetate), were as effective in controlling wheat rust (Puccinia recondita) as foliar-applied tebuconazole, Raxil, from Bayer AG. Results suggest that CR formulations with a systemic fungicide, such as tebuconazole, applied as either a soil or seed treatment, may provide control of foliar diseases, possibly eliminating or reducing the need for traditional foliar applications.","Asrar, J; Ding, YW; La Monica, RE; Ness, LC",JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY,2004,10.1021/jf0306385,0.97445874941473,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.898696038044277,0.101303961955723,0.999993609931444,6.39006855596147e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
15312,Antimicrobial Potential of Endophytic Fungi from Medicinal Plants of Tropical Islands in Andaman India,"Endophytic fungi are prolific producers of analogues putative phytochemicals which can be exploited for human therapeutic intervention and drug development. Mangroves of Andaman are still untapped for their potential fungi and its activities. The current investigation deals with screening of 19 endophytic isolates derived from different medicinal plants for their antimicrobial activity. The fungi with highest antimicrobial activity were characterized by phylogenetic analysis. Amongst, the tested endophytic fungal isolates, the ethyl acetate fraction of three endophytic isolates, referred as MG 4, MG 13 and MG 16 exhibited potential antibacterial activity against the test panel microorganisms. In in-vitro agar well diffusion assay, MG 16 exhibited highest antibacterial activity showing inhibition zone size ranging between 17-24.7 mm whereas isolates MG 4 and MG 13 exhibited inhibition zones ranging between 15.3 to 24.7 mm respectively. Furthermore, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of three endophytic fungi ranges between 1.9-62.5 µg/ml against the test panel of Gram positive and Gram negative microorganisms. Isolate MG 4 was showing 100% sequence similarity with Sarocladium strictum whereas isolatesMG 13, MG 16 showed 99% sequence similarity with F. falciforme and F. incarnatum respectively.

21186,Elicitation of forskolin in cultures of Rhizactonia bataticola-a phytochemical synthesizing endophytic fungi,"Objective: Coleus forskohlii is the only known source of Forskolin-a labdanediterpene and a highly valuable phytochemical. Coleus forskohlii has been listed as endangered plant; therefore, efforts have been made to find novel sources of Forskolin production. Methods: Endophytic fungi were isolated from Coleus forskohlii tissue and screened for Forskolin production by using thin layer chromatography (TLC) method. Further, 16 different elicitation media combinations were used to enhance the Forskolin content. Results: In this study, out of 38 strains of endophytic fungi from Coleus forskohlii only 2 strains EF1 and EF2 were found to synthesize Forskolin in mycelium, whereas EF2 was found to release the Forskolin into the broth. Further, EF2 was identified as Rhizactonia bataticola accession no. NFCCI 2028. Further, T2S1 media showed dramatic effects on enhanced Forskolin production in mycelium. However, there was a significant increase about four folds in broth which corresponded to 0.5 mg compared to T1S1media where it was 0.09 mg. Conclusion: The present study suggests that the Forskolin producing Rhizactonia bataticola and T2S1 media can serve as potential materials for large scale enhancement of Forskolin production. © 2015, International Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science.

A total of 53 endophytic bacterial orders in12 phyla and 24 endophytic fungal orders in 2 phyla were detected in healthy, asymptomatic and symptomatic leaf midribs. It was found that the predominant endophytic bacteria belonged to Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes and the predominant endophytic fungi belonged to Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) analysis showed that OTU_2 and OTU_6 were the core endophytic fungal OTUs, and OTU_10, OTU_4 and OTU_141 were the core endophytic bacterial OTUs. The richness and diversity of the endophytic microbes were affected by infection of the HLB bacterium, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas). The most significant change was the reduction in endophytic fungal OTUs following CLas infection. Eleven endophytic fungal OTUs and 24 endophytic bacterial OTUs were found to be associated with tree healthy status in citrus. Some of the healthy and HLB disease specific OTUs were discussed, with emphasis on their possible roles in HLB pathogenesis.","Yan, HX; Zhou, BR; Jiang, B; Lv, YD; Moniruzzaman, MD; Zhong, GY; Zhong, Y",PHYSIOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY,2021,10.1016/j.pmpp.2020.101590,0.983305109305438,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.809220683289963,0.190779316710037,0.999991782993238,8.21700676167936e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

We recently established the antibacterial activity of ethyl acetate extracts of endophyte fungus P. herbarum in vitro and identified some potentially active components using GC-MS. The current study aims to perform molecular docking of the discovered P. herbarum compounds against Mur enzymes (Mur A, Mur C, Mur D, and Mur F) of Staphylococcus aureus using Auto Dock Tools 1.5.6. SwissADME online tool was used to calculate the drug-likeness characteristics. According to the findings, only 14 of 23 bioactive compounds evaluated from P. herbarum extract adhered to Lipinski’s Rule of Five (LRo5) and had binding affinity ranged between − 3.5 to -6.5 (kcal/mol) with at least one of the four targeted Mur enzymes.

Methods: The plant parts were collected from healthy-looking A. corniculatum. The endophytes were isolated and identified by colonial morphology and macroscopic characteristics and DNA sequencing of fungal ITS region, and then grouped by phylogenetic analysis. Antibacterial activity was assayed using five human pathogenic bacteria (B. cereus, P. aeruginosa, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and A. baumanii) out of which two of them were MDR bacteria. Ethyl acetate extracts from endophytes were prepared, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 3 endophytes was tested using serial 2-fold dilutions of the extract. Results: 61 endophytes obtained from A. corniculatum were grouped into 6 genera (Colletotrichum, Alternaria, Phomopsis, Pestalotiopsis, Guignardia, Cladosporium). Colletotrichum and Pestalotiopsis were the most frequent genera, accounting for colonization frequencies (CF) of 29.5 and 37.7%. Among the rare morphotypes, Alternaria, Phomopsis, Guignardia and Cladosporium were the infrequent genera, accounting for CF ranging from 3.2 to 13.1%. Overall, 3 endophytes, including Glomerella, Guignardia, and Cladosporium, all isolated from the leaves, showed inhibitory activity against five test bacteria in vitro. The endophyte, Colletotrichum, inhibited two MDR K. pneumoniae and A. baumanii, while Guignardia inhibits MDR K. pneumoniae. The MIC of the extract of Colletotrichum against MDR K. pneumoniae was 4 mu g/ml, against MDR A. baumanii was 0.5 mu g/ml, while MIC of Guignardia to K. pneumoniae was 8 mu g/ml. Conclusion: The study demonstrates that endophytes from mangrove plant A. corniculatum were a fascinating fungal reservoir against MDR pathogenic bacteria.","Gong, B; Chen, YP; Zhang, H; Xiong, Z; Zhang, YQ; Fang, HY; Zhong, QP; Zhang, CX",TROPICAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH,2014,10.4314/tjpr.v13i4.16,0.843696613633995,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998064464879327,0.00193553512067318,0.999999993918466,6.0815336100361606e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

5759,Identification of Alternaria spp. as causal agent of dead flower buds disease of pear (Pyrus communis) in the Netherlands and methods for disease control,"The occurrence of dead dormant flower buds is a common phenomenon of economic importance in the major pear production areas of Europe. Thus far, the cause of dead flower buds disease remained unknown. Several causes have been proposed, including insufficient tree chilling, unmet dormancy requirements, incompatibility between scion and cultivar, but also various biotic stress agents such as pathogens and pests. In this study, we tested the relationship between reduction of tree growth and dead flower bud incidences, but found no indication that growth regulation can prevent the occurrence of dead flower buds. It has been proposed that the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae may be the causal agent of dead flower buds of pear. However, although we found the bacterium as epiphyte and even as endophyte on and in flower buds, our findings argue that P. syringae pv. syringae is not the causal agent of dead flower buds disease in the Netherlands. In our research, Alternaria spp. were consistently found in diseased flower buds, and strong correlations between dead dormant flower buds and infection rates of flower buds with Alternaria spp. were recorded. The isolated Alternaria species were identified as A. arborescens SC and A. alternata SC. Field experiments for disease control showed that the disease may be controlled by specific fungicide applications. Thus, we propose that dead flower buds of pear in the Netherlands should be regarded as a fungal disease caused by A. alternata SC and potentially also A. arborescens SC.","Wenneker, M; Pham, KTK; Woudenberg, JHC; Thomma, BPHJ",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY,2019,10.1007/s10658-019-01827-7,0.892967157492337,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.979945995888226,0.0200540041117738,0.999996784161514,3.2158384859482e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

However, apart from mycorrhizae little is known about the responses of other root-associated fungi to these compounds. Here, we report results from an in vitro experiment where impacts of biologically meaningful concentrations of selected lichen secondary metabolites and lichen extracts on the radial growth of two ubiquitous root-associated fungi were under scrutiny. The growth of both fungal species, Phialocephala fortinii, a fungus belonging to the dark-septate endophyte complex, and Rhizoscyphus ericae, a mycorrhizal associate of Ericaceous plants, responded negatively to the studied concentrations of lichen phenols, whereas lichenan did not affect the growth of either of the species. Extracts from epiphytic Hypogymnia physodes had variable effects on the fungi. We conclude that lichen phenols are potentially antibiotic towards root-associated fungi, and lichenan is not readily degradable by the fungal species studied.

Efficacy in promoting plant growth and reducing disease severity and final nematode densities were evaluated for two arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF; Funneliformis mosseae and Rhizophagus irregularis), three soil bacteria with different living strategies (the endophyte Bacillus megaterium, a rhizospheric Pseudomonas putida and the hyperparasite of nematodes Pasteuria penetrans) and combinations of the fungi and bacteria. In M. incognita-infested plants, F. mosseae increased tomato growth more than R. irregularis, and plants inoculated with B. megaterium presented higher shoot fresh weight than with P. putida or P. penetrans, but dual inoculation did not improve tomato growth more than single inoculations. Disease severity and final nematode densities were reduced by F. mosseae compared to non-mycorrhizal plants. B. megaterium and P. penetrans reduced both the root galling and the final nematode densities compared to treatments without bacteria. P. penetrans reduced final nematode densities more than B. megaterium or P. putida. Dual inoculation of AMF and P. penetrans showed the highest efficacy in reducing the final nematode densities in tomato.","Flor-Peregrín, E; Azcón, R; Martos, V; Verdejo-Lucas, S; Talavera, M",BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,2014,10.1080/09583157.2014.925091,0.978823769132748,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994881106209221,0.00511889379077864,0.999999987098899,1.29011011873459e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12404,"Investigation of alpha-glucosidase inhibition activity of Artabotrys sumatranus leaf extract using metabolomics, machine learning and molecular docking analysis","One way to treat diabetes mellitus type II is by using alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, that will slow down the postprandial glucose intake. Metabolomics analysis of Artabotrys sumatranus leaf extract was used in this research to predict the active compounds as alpha-glucosidase inhibitors from this extract. Both multivariate statistical analysis and machine learning approaches were used to improve the confidence of the predictions. After performance comparisons with other machine learning methods, random forest was chosen to make predictive model for the activity of the extract samples. Feature importance analysis (using random feature permutation and Shapley score calculation) was used to identify the predicted active compound as the important features that influenced the activity prediction of the extract samples. The combined analysis of multivariate statistical analysis and machine learning predicted 9 active compounds, where 6 of them were identified as mangiferin, neomangiferin, norisocorydine, apigenin-7-O-galactopyranoside, lirioferine, and 15,16-dihydrotanshinone I. The activities of norisocorydine, apigenin-7-O-galactopyranoside, and lirioferine as alpha-glucosidase inhibitors have not yet reported before. Molecular docking simulation, both to 3A4A (alpha-glucosidase enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, usually used in bioassay test) and 3TOP (a part of alpha-glucosidase enzyme in human gut) showed strong to very strong binding of the identified predicted active compounds to both receptors, with exception of neomangiferin which only showed strong binding to 3TOP receptor. Isolation based on bioassay guided fractionation further verified the metabolomics prediction by succeeding to isolate mangiferin from the extract, which showed strong alpha-glucosidase activity when subjected to bioassay test. The correlation analysis also showed a possibility of 3 groups in the predicted active compounds, which might be related to the biosynthesis pathway (need further research for verification). Another result from correlation analysis was that in general the alpha-glucosidase inhibition activity in the extract had strong correlation to antioxidant activity, which was also reflected in the predicted active compounds. Only one predicted compound had very low positive correlation to antioxidant activity.","Rosa, D; Elya, B; Hanafi, M; Khatib, A; Budiarto, E; Nur, S; Surya, MI",PLOS ONE,2025,10.1371/journal.pone.0313592,0.961409582871901,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.986420662236509,0.0135793377634906,0.999999917050858,8.29491424436668e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16557,Combined analysis of tall fescue steer grazing studies in the Eastern United States.,"The mixed-models procedure (MMP) was used to analyze pooled data sets from 12 independent studies conducted during the last 13 yr at nine locations in seven states to provide combined estimates of daily gains by beef steers (Bos taurus) grazing tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) pastures free of (E-) or infested (E+) at different levels with the endophytic fungus Acremonium coenophialum. Treatments included low-infestation (< or = 5% E+), moderate-infestation (> or = 20 to < or = 35% E+), and high-infestation (> or = 50 to < or = 97% E+) tall fescue pastures, and, in tall fescue-clover (Trifolium spp.) mixtures, pastures at the same E+ levels with approximately 25 and 10% clover in spring and summer stands, respectively. Spring, summer, and combined spring+summer data were analyzed separately. The MMP permitted estimation of the fixed effects of treatments over a broad inference space of future years and different tall fescue pastures over a wide geographic range; detected relationships that had not been apparent in the individual studies, such as the interactions between clover presence and E+ infestation levels; and provided a more coherent body of information than did the results obtained from each discrete study.

18404,Indoleacetic acid production and plant growth promoting potential of bacterial endophytes isolated from rice (Oryza sativa L.) seeds.,"Bacterial endophytes from the phyllosphere and rhizosphere have been used to produce bioactive metabolites and to promote plant growth. However, little is known about the endophytes residing in seeds. This study aimed to isolate and identify seed-borne bacterial endophytes from rice and elucidate their potential for phytohormone production and growth enhancement. The isolated endophytes included Micrococcus yunnanensis RWL-2, Micrococcus luteus RWL-3, Enterobacter soli RWL-4, Leclercia adecarboxylata RWL-5, Pantoea dispersa RWL-6, and Staphylococcus epidermidis RWL-7, which were identified using 16S rRNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. These strains were analyzed for indoleacetic acid (IAA) production by using GC-MS and IAA was found in the range of 11.50 ± 0.77 μg ml-1 to 38.80 ± 1.35 μg ml-1. We also assessed the strains for plant growth promoting potential because these isolates were able to produce IAA in pure culture. Most of the growth attributes of rice plants (shoot and root length, fresh and dry biomass, and chlorophyll content) were significantly increased by bacterial endophytes compared to the controls.

Antifungal assay was evaluated from crude extract of endophytic fungal strain. The crude extract isolated from endophytic fungi showing potential activity against bacteria and fungi. The fungal crude extract showed potential activity at higher concentration 500 mu g/mL inhibited the growth of R. stolonifur (10 mm), A. niger (9.9mm) P. chrysogenum (8.3mm) and T. horzianum (7.8mm) respectively. While lower zone of inhibition was observed at 20 mu g/mL concentration against the pathogenic fungal strains i.e T. horzianum (2.3mm), P. chrysogenum (5.5mm) and A. niger (6.3mm) and no inhibition was recorded in the R. stolonifur (0). LCMS analysis showed that the crude extract have the presence of bioactive secondary metabolites. From the present study it is concluded that the crude extract obtained from endophytic fungi Cladosporium sphaerospermum contain bioactive compounds that have the potential to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria and fungi.

11762,Reassessment of Treubia species (Marchantiophyta: Treubiaceae) in New Zealand,"Treubia belongs to the Haplomitriopsida, a small class of deeply divergent liverworts with an ancient fossil record. Treubia is a genus of interest for having an unusual endophytic fungal association and in having single large oil-bodies in some of the cells whose size and frequency are taxonomically useful. The taxonomy of Treubia in New Zealand has been uncertain and between two and four species have been suggested to be present. DNA sequences and morphology confirm that there are two species of Treubia in New Zealand, Treubia lacunosa and T. pygmaea. The two can be separated morphologically using a combination of shoot width, differences in frequency and size of oil-body cells, presence or absence of gemmae, and differences in habitat. The frequency of oil-bodies in leaf cells alone is insufficient to distinguish the two. New comprehensive descriptions of both New Zealand species are provided, and Treubia lacunosa is re-neotypified. Treubia lacunosoides is a new synonym of T lacunosa. Treubia tasmanica, which is found in Tasmania, Australia, was confirmed to be morphologically indistinguishable from T pygmaea but was found to have consistent and significant plastid DNA sequence differences to the New Zealand species.","Glenny, D; Bulman, S; Tremblay, S",NOVA HEDWIGIA,2015,10.1127/nova_hedwigia/2015/0256,0.989928747644563,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.899754627465535,0.100245372534465,0.999999965485932,3.45140684920864e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
1520,Dark septate endophyte enhances maize cadmium (Cd) tolerance by the remodeled host cell walls and the altered Cd subcellular distribution,"Evidence accumulated in recent years supports the crucial role of remodeled cell walls (CWs) in enabling plants to adapt to environmental challenges. However, the metal tolerance and alleviation mechanisms involving the CWs by endophyte-plant interactions to toxic metals have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, these mechanisms are tested by exploring the maize (Zea mays) Cd tolerance by modifying its root CW structure via inoculation with a dark septate endophyte (DSE) fungus Exophiala pisciphila. Our present study demonstrates that the root CWs were the primary site for Cd accumulation, functioning as a sink for toxic Cd ions. Interestingly, E. pisciphila colonization significantly bioaugmented subcellular compartmentalization of maize roots and increased the Cd content of various CW subfractions through a significantly increased enzyme activity, e.g., pectin methylesterase, as well as an upregulated expression of genes involved in CW biosynthesis and changes in the contents of functional groups in pectin and hemicellulose 1 in response to Cd stress. Consequently, the enhanced Cd compartmentation in plant CWs by DSE lowers the entry of trace metals in the protoplast, thereby conferring the tolerant races of plants that can survive and thrive on metal-contaminated soils.","Shen, M; Schneider, H; Xu, RB; Cao, GH; Zhang, HB; Li, T; Zhao, ZW",ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,2020,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2020.104000,0.9918638790714,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.961702521463661,0.0382974785363392,0.999807003207058,1.9299679294171e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

12098,Foliar Diseases and the Associated Fungi in Rice Cultivated in Kenya,"We conducted a survey to assess the occurrence and severity of rice blast and brown spot diseases on popular cultivars grown in the Busia, Kirinyaga, and Kisumu counties of Kenya in 2019. Working with agricultural extension workers within rice production areas, we interviewed farmers (n = 89) regarding their preferred cultivars and their awareness of blast disease, as this was the major focus of our research. We scored the symptoms of blast and brown spot and assessed the lodging, plant height, and maturity of the crops (days after planting). Furthermore, we collected leaf and neck tissues for the assessment of the prevailing fungal populations. We used specific DNA primers to screen for the prevalence of the causal pathogens of blast, Magnaporthe oryzae, and brown spot, Cochliobolus miyabeanus, on asymptomatic and symptomatic leaf samples. We also conducted fungal isolations and PCR-sequencing to identify the fungal species in these tissues. Busia and Kisumu had a higher diversity of cultivars compared to Kirinyaga. The aromatic Pishori (NIBAM 11) was preferred and widely grown for commercial purposes in Kirinyaga, where 86% of Kenyan rice is produced. NIBAM108 (IR2793-80-1) and BW196 (NIBAM 109) were moderately resistant to blast, while NIBAM110 (ITA310) and Vietnam were susceptible. All the cultivars were susceptible to brown spot except for KEH10005 (Arize Tej Gold), a commercial hybrid cultivar. We also identified diverse pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi, with a high incidence of Nigrospora oryzae, in the rice fields of Kirinyaga. There was a marginal correlation between disease severity/incidence and the occurrence of causal pathogens. This study provides evidence of the need to strengthen pathogen surveillance through retraining agricultural extension agents and to breed for blast and brown spot resistance in popular rice cultivars in Kenya.","Nganga, EM; Kyallo, M; Orwa, P; Rotich, F; Gichuhi, E; Kimani, JM; Mwongera, D; Waweru, B; Sikuku, P; Musyimi, DM; Mutiga, SK; Ziyomo, C; Murori, R; Wasilwa, L; Correll, JC; Talbot, NJ",PLANTS-BASEL,2022,10.3390/plants11091264,0.988375859045338,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993519651909876,0.00648034809012396,0.999999992561915,7.4380845926924605e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18890,Mechanism of Bacillus cooperating with silicon to re-balance chlorophyll metabolism and restore carbon metabolism of Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. Seedlings exposed to salt-drought stress.,"Salt-drought is a major environmental event affecting crop productivity and quality by causing chlorophyll (Chl) and carbon balance disorder. There has been growing interest in the application of endophyte and silicon (Si), as inoculants for saline and drought land restoration. This study investigates the impact of Bacillus (Bs), Si, and Bs + Si on the disorder of Chl metabolism and carbon balance of G. uralensis seedlings under salt-drought stress (SD). Results showed that both Bs and Si treatments enhanced Chl and carbon metabolism, with the combined Bs and Si treatment showing a synergistic effect. Specifically, Bs + Si enhanced the mutual conversion of Chl a and Chl b, restored the equilibrium in Chl a and Chl b content, and increased RuBisco activity by 31.07%, thereby promoting carbon fixation. Subsequently, Bs + Si re-balanced the carbohydrate content, by increasing the sucrose synthase (SS), and β-amylase (BMY) activities by 49.57%, and 83.59% respectively, and decreasing sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), and granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS) activities by 38.93%, 40.93% respectively etc involved in the metabolism of sucrose and starch. Furthermore, Bs + Si facilitated the restoration of the typical progression of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and glycolysis pathway (EMP).

8467,"Community composition of root-associated fungi in a Quercus-dominated temperate forest: ""codominance"" of mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi","In terrestrial ecosystems, plant roots are colonized by various clades of mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi. Focused on the root systems of an oak-dominated temperate forest in Japan, we used 454 pyrosequencing to explore how phylogenetically diverse fungi constitute an ecological community of multiple ecotypes. In total, 345 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of fungi were found from 159 terminal-root samples from 12 plant species occurring in the forest. Due to the dominance of an oak species (Quercus serrata), diverse ectomycorrhizal clades such as Russula, Lactarius, Cortinarius, Tomentella, Amanita, Boletus, and Cenococcum were observed. Unexpectedly, the root-associated fungal community was dominated by root-endophytic ascomycetes in Helotiales, Chaetothyriales, and Rhytismatales. Overall, 55.3% of root samples were colonized by both the commonly observed ascomycetes and ectomycorrhizal fungi; 75.0% of the root samples of the dominant Q. serrata were so cocolonized. Overall, this study revealed that root-associated fungal communities of oak-dominated temperate forests were dominated not only by ectomycorrhizal fungi but also by diverse root endophytes and that potential ecological interactions between the two ecotypes may be important to understand the complex assembly processes of belowground fungal communities.","Toju, H; Yamamoto, S; Sato, H; Tanabe, AS; Gilbert, GS; Kadowaki, K",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2013,10.1002/ece3.546,0.918116599930053,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.942293074568604,0.0577069254313961,0.999060737221859,0.00093926277814104005,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
9610,Fungal 7-epi-10-deacetyltaxol produced by an endophytic Pestalotiopsis microspora induces apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (HepG2),"Background: Paclitaxel (taxol) is a potent anticancer drug that is used in the treatment of a wide variety of cancerous. In the present study, we identified a taxol derivative named 7-epi-10-deacetyltaxol (EDT) from the culture of an endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis microspora isolated from the bark of Taxodium mucronatum. This study was carried out to investigate the effects of fungal EDT on cell proliferation, the induction of apoptosis and the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis in human hepatoma HepG2 cells in vitro. Methods: The endophytic fungus was identified by traditional and molecular taxonomical characterization and the fungal EDT was purified using column chromatography and confirmed by various spectroscopic and chromatographic comparisons with authentic paclitaxel. We studied the in vitro effects of EDT on HepG2 cells for parameters such as cell cycle distribution, DNA fragmentation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and nuclear morphology. Further, western blot analysis was used to evaluate Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), p38-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase (PARP) expression. Results: We demonstrate that the fungal EDT exhibited significant in vitro cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells. We investigated cytotoxicity mechanism of EDT in HepG2 cells. The results showed nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation were observed in cells treated with fungal EDT. Besides, the fungal EDT arrested HepG2 cells at G2/M phase of cell cycle. Furthermore, fungal EDT induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner associated with ROS generation and increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, p38 MAPKs and PARP cleavage. Conclusions: Our data show that EDT induced apoptotic cell death in HepG2 cells occurs through intrinsic pathway by generation of ROS mediated and activation of MAPK pathway.

Plants of the cultivar Baco Blanc a grapevine hybrid of Folle Blanche and Noah used to produce Armagnac in France were sampled. Methods and Results: Forty-two and 58-year-old vines, planted in the same vineyard, were uprooted, cut longitudinally and their functional wood tissues sampled. Culture-dependent and single-strand conformational polymorphism methods were used to compare the fungal communities colonising these wood tissues. It was shown that the fungal communities were significantly different depending on the age of the grapevines. A total of 421 fungal strains were isolated and identified by internal transcribed spacer region sequencing. Conclusions: Many grapevine trunk diseases fungal pathogens, particularly the causal agents of Esca (42-year-old vines) and Eutypa dieback (58-year-old vines), as well as numerous potentially plant-beneficial mycoparasites (e.g. Trichoderma spp.), were isolated from the functional wood tissues of old grapevines. Significance of the Study: The lack of foliar symptoms among older grapevines may reflect an 'equilibrium' among trunk fungal pathogens, mycoparasites and saprobes in the functional wood tissues of trunks.","Bruez, E; Baumgartner, K; Bastien, S; Travadon, R; Guérin-Dubrana, L; Rey, P",AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF GRAPE AND WINE RESEARCH,2016,10.1111/ajgw.12209,0.811940994198307,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999971266005562,2.87339944384594e-5,0.999999999990712,9.28812582401406e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

1338,The Epichloe festucae Antifungal Protein Efe-AfpA Is also a Possible Effector Protein Required for the Interaction of the Fungus with Its Host Grass Festuca rubra subsp. rubra,"Strong creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra subsp. rubra) is a commercially important low-maintenance turfgrass and is often naturally infected with the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae. Epichloe spp. are endophytes of several cool-season grass species, often conferring insect resistance to the grass hosts due to the production of toxic alkaloids. In addition to insect resistance, a unique feature of the strong creeping red fescue/E. festucae symbiosis is the endophyte-mediated disease resistance to the fungal pathogen Clarireedia jacksonii, the causal agent of dollar spot disease. Such disease resistance is not a general feature of other grass/ Epichloe interactions. E. festucae isolates infecting red fescue have an antifungal protein gene Efe-afpA, whereas most other Epichloe spp. do not have a similar gene. The uniqueness of this gene suggests it may, therefore, be a component of the unique disease resistance seen in endophyte-infected red fescue. Here, we report the generation of CRISPR-Cas9 Efe-afpA gene knockouts with the goal of determining if absence of the protein in endophyte-infected Festuca rubra leads to disease susceptibility. However, it was not possible to infect plants with the knockout isolates, although infection was possible with the wild type E. festucae and with complemented isolates. This raises the interesting possibility that, in addition to having antifungal activity, the protein is required for the symbiotic interaction. The antifungal protein is a small secreted protein with high expression in planta relative to its expression in culture, all characteristics consistent with effector proteins. If Efe-AfpA is an effector protein it must be specific to certain interactions, since most Epichloe spp. do not have such a gene in their genomes.","Wang, RY; Luo, SM; Clarke, BB; Belanger, FC",MICROORGANISMS,2021,10.3390/microorganisms9010140,0.976469601809661,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.909909521889202,0.0900904781107983,0.999998226428039,1.77357196085026e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Here, we discuss the roles of the phytohormones (auxins, cytokinin, gibberellins, abscisic acid, ethylene, salicylic acid, jasmonates, and brassinosteroids) in the interaction of P. indica with higher plant species, and compare available data with those from other (beneficial) microorganisms interacting with roots. Crosstalks between different hormones in balancing the plant responses to microbial signals is an emerging topic in current research. Furthermore, phytohormones play crucial roles in systemic signal propagation as well as interplant communication. P. indica interferes with plant hormone synthesis and signaling to stimulate growth, flowering time, differentiation and local and systemic immune responses. Plants adjust their hormone levels in the roots in response to the microbes to control colonization and fungal propagation. The available information on the roles of phytohormones in beneficial root-microbe interactions opens new questions of how P. indica manipulates the plant hormone metabolism to promote the benefits for both partners in the symbiosis.",Xu L; Wu C; Oelmüller R; Zhang W,Frontiers in microbiology,2018,10.3389/fmicb.2018.01646,0.950418195928149,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.97412399400906,0.0258760059909397,0.999996986705386,3.01329461405153e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
13665,"Genetic Diversity in Tall Fescue Ecotypes from Alabama I. Maturity, Morphological Traits, and Disease Reaction","There is a large hectarage of tall fescue in Alabama. Recognition of the deleterious effects of the endophytic fungus Acremonium coenophialum has resulted in substantial acceptance of new endophyte‐free cultivars. Destruction of old pastures and the concomitant loss of potentially valuable adapted germplasm could be a valid cause for concern. The objectives of this study were to evaluate genetic variation for maturity and plant morphological traits, both among and within tall fescue cv. ‘Kentucky 31’ populations from 18 to 38 year‐old pastures in Alabama. Ten populations of approximately 50 plants each were collected from old Alabama tall fescue pastures. Two pastures were sampled in each of five counties, representing the five major land use areas of the state. In 1990, spaced plants of all populations were evaluated at heading time for maturity, morphological, and disease traits at two locations in central Alabama. Endophyte infection level of the populations ranged from 2 to 100 %. Maturity was highly correlated with tiller length and flag leaf width and was used as a covariate for these traits in the analysis of variance. Leaf rust and net blotch ratings were negatively correlated. Significant variation among populations was observed for maturity and flag leaf dimensions, most variation being due to differences among source counties. Significant variation was observed within all populations for maturity and morphological traits, but only in seven populations for leaf rust. No within‐population variation was detected for net blotch. The average precipitation for the month of May explained 81 % of the variation among populations for maturity. Age of the pasture sampled had a significant effect on tiller diameter (r2= 0.55), and latitude of the pasture sampled was the best individual predictor of leaf width (r2= 0.42). This study reveals that considerable genetic diversity, largely influenced by climatic conditions, exists among ‘Kentucky 31’ tall fescue ecotypes from Alabama. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell.

1944,Response of sod webworm Chrysoteuchia topiaria Zeller (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) to endophyte infection and mycotoxin profiles of cool-season turfgrass species grown for seed in Oregon,"The subterranean sod webworm, also known as cranberry girdler (Chrysoteuchia topiaria), is one of the most damaging insect pests in cool-season grass grown for seed crops in Oregon. Chemical control options are limited and require irrigation or rainfall for adequate insecticide incorporation to control C. topiaria larvae. Epichlo & euml; endophytes associated with cool-season turfgrass species and their mycotoxin profiles are well-documented in offering plant protection against invertebrates; these fungi may offer sustainable pest management tools. Our objectives were to characterize endophyte-mediated resistance to C. topiaria in 19 commercially available cultivars of tall fescue, perennial ryegrass, and fine fescue grown for seed in Oregon. Endophyte status (presence and viability) of fungal endophytes and their mycotoxin profiles were measured using polymerase chain reaction, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. No-choice assays were conducted in the laboratory to measure the impact of endophyte status on C. topiaria larvae in two separate no-choice experiments. Our results suggested that increased mortality of C. topiaria larvae (R-2 = 0.8526, Experiment 1; R-2 = 0.6628, Experiment 2) in tall fescue cultivars was most influenced by total peramine and ergot alkaloid, and total ergoline concentrations in Experiment 1 and 2, respectively. However, no significant effect on insect mortality was found in the perennial ryegrass and fine fescue cultivars included in this study. Overall, these findings suggest a viable grass-endophyte association can be utilized as a sustainable alternative to foliar insecticides for C. topiaria management in tall fescue seed crops. Plain Language Summary This is an applied research article. This study explored the endophyte status of 19 commercially available cultivars of three cool-season grass species. Two experiments were conducted in which insect response was measured regarding mortality after 7-10 days of feeding on each cultivar. We found that increased mortality occurred in endophyte-infected tall fescue cultivars. Furthermore, the insect resistance response was also found to be associated with the production of mycotoxins in these cultivars.","Kaur, N; Rivedal, HM; Intasin, J; Verhoeven, EC; Di, YM; Anderson, NP; Dorman, SJ; Duringer, JM",CROP FORAGE & TURFGRASS MANAGEMENT,2024,10.1002/cft2.20291,0.991866121938365,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.923681371108478,0.0763186288915217,0.999999999971686,2.8314461886225198e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19128,Unraveling the functional characteristics of endophytic bacterial diversity for plant growth promotion and enhanced secondary metabolite production in Pelargonium graveolens.,"The rich diversity of microbial endophytic communities associated with plants, often referred to as the second genome, serves as a compelling illustration of efficient co-evolution. This noteworthy partnership plays a pivotal role in sustaining plant well-being and enhancing plant adaptability across diverse habitats. Therefore, examining the diversity of endophytic microbes associated with their particular host plant is valuable for gaining insights into the vast spectrum of plant-microbe interactions. The present experiments aimed at investigating the bacterial endophytic diversity in both root and shoot tissues of Pelargonium graveolens, employing culture dependent and culture independent high-throughput metagenomics approach. A total of 614 and 620 operational taxonomic units (OTUs), encompassing 291 and 229 genera, were identified in the shoot and root tissues of P. graveolens, respectively. Furthermore, the subsequent classification of OTUs revealed 15 highly abundant phyla, with Proteobacteria dominating both root and shoot tissues. Notably, an exceptionally high abundance of Firmicutes phyla was observed in the shoot compared to the root. Additionally, 30 bacterial endophytes from the root, stem, petiole, and leaves were isolated and molecularly characterized, unveiling a consistent pattern of diversity distribution between the root and shoot of P. graveolens. Upon screening all isolates for plant growth promoting traits, Pseudomonas oryzihabitans was found to be positive for major biochemical test like nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization etc. and on inoculation resulted in about two-fold increase in content of essential oil accompanied by a significant rise in the geraniol and citronellol content. Diving deep into the genetic constitution of P. oryzihabitans unveiled a substantial number of genes directly and indirectly contributing to the endophyte's capability in colonizing host plants effectively. In summary, data obtained from metagenomics and culture dependent approaches including glass house trials suggest potential bacterial endophytes suitable for field applications for yield enhancement and in planta secondary metabolite enhancement investigations.",Deepa N; Chauhan S; Singh A,Microbiological research,2024,10.1016/j.micres.2024.127673,0.949833342592047,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.822729724838912,0.177270275161088,0.999991791254681,8.20874531870519e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
4069,Application of bacteria symbiotic with Butia archeri (Arecaceae) to the biocontrol of the phytopathogenic fungi that deteriorate seeds of Glycine max,"Rhizospheric and endophytic microorganisms compete with phytopathogens for ecological niches, which led us to hypothesise that bacteria symbiotic with the palm Butia archeri may influence the germination of the seeds of Glycine max and provide effective biocontrol against phytopathogens. We evaluated seed biopriming with rhizospheric strains of the bacteria Enterobacter asburiae and Bacillus cereus, and endophytic strains of Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter sp., Bacillus sp. and Pantoea agglomerans. Seeds treated with E. cloacae and Enterobacter sp. presented higher germination potential, germination velocity index and accumulation of fresh biomass in the radicle than seeds that were untreated or treated with other bacteria. Seeds that were not treated were also most affected by fungi, in particular Fusarium and Penicillium, during storage. When treated with B. cereus and E. asburiae, fungal infestation of the stored seeds was reduced to levels similar to those found in seeds treated with chemical fungicide. Our combined analysis of the influence of these strains on radicular growth and the control of phytopathogens, indicates that the rhizospheric strains of B. cereus and E. asburiae may have the best potential for biocontrol. The present study also demonstrated that the microbiota associated with plants native to the Brazilian Cerrado may be a promising source of species or biomolecules with potential for the biocontrol of plant pathogens.","Vitorino, LC; Palharini, KMZ; Rocha, AFD; Prates, LS; Goulart, LG; Silva, AL; Bessa, LA",SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,2019,10.15258/sst.2019.47.3.08,0.985966736290402,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992488308186683,0.0075116918133168,0.99999999975949,2.40510278359807e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10485,Fungal Symbionts Alter Plant Drought Response,"Grassland productivity is often primarily limited by water availability, and therefore, grasslands may be especially sensitive to climate change. Fungal symbionts can mediate plant drought response by enhancing drought tolerance and avoidance, but these effects have not been quantified across grass species. We performed a factorial meta-analysis of previously published studies to determine how arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and endophytic fungal symbionts affect growth of grasses under drought. We then examined how the effect of fungal symbionts on plant growth was influenced by biotic (plant photosynthetic pathway) and abiotic (level of drought) factors. We also measured the phylogenetic signal of fungal symbionts on grass growth under control and drought conditions. Under drought conditions, grasses colonized by AM fungi grew larger than those without mycorrhizal symbionts. The increased growth of grasses conferred from fungal symbionts was greatest at the lowest soil moisture levels. Furthermore, under both drought and control conditions, C3 grasses colonized by AM fungi grew larger than C3 grasses without symbionts, but the biomass of C4 grasses was not affected by AM fungi. Endophytes did not increase plant biomass overall under any treatment. However, there was a phylogenetically conserved increase in plant biomass in grasses colonized by endophytes. Grasses and their fungal symbionts seem to interact within a context-dependent symbiosis, varying with biotic and abiotic conditions. Because plant-fungal symbioses significantly alter plant drought response, including these responses could improve our ability to predict grassland functioning under global change.","Worchel, ER; Giauque, HE; Kivlin, SN",MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,2013,10.1007/s00248-012-0151-6,0.991918411987971,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999552254039977,4.4774596002294e-4,0.999999997960117,2.03988337332817e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
4971,CONTROL OF RHIZOCTONIA-SOLANI AND SCLEROTIUM-ROLFSII IN THE GREENHOUSE USING ENDOPHYTIC BACILLUS SPP,"Isolates of different endophytic bacteria were recovered from surface-disinfected seeds obtained from commercial companies, plants in the field and tissue culture. The bacteria were isolated from seeds after stringent surface-disinfection. Pseudomonas fluorescens (isolate no. 14) from bean inhibited growth of all fungi tested and was fluorescent on King B medium. Bacillus cereus from Sinapis (isolate no. 65) inhibited growth of Rhizoctonia solani, Pythium ultimum and Sclerotium rolfsii and also exhibited chitinase activity. Bacillus subtilis from onion tissue culture (isolate no. 72) inhibited R, solani and P. ultimum growth. B, cereus from cauliflower (isolate no. 78) inhibited growth of R. solani. B. pumilus from sunflower (isolate no. 85) inhibited growth of R. solani and S. rolfsii. B. cereus (isolate no. 65) was introduced into cotton, and by using radioactive labelling we found that it was present for 16 days in the root-stem junction. It is most likely that these bacteria were still found 72 days after their introduction in the root and stem, at levels of 2.8.10(5) and 5.10(4) cfu g(-1) fresh weight, respectively, when selective o medium was used. There was no difference between control and treated plants in their height or in the fresh weight of roots, stems and leaves. When cotton seedlings were inoculated with B. cereus (isolate no. 65), B. subtilis (isolate no. 72) or B. pumilus (isolate no. 85), disease incidence caused by Rhizoctonia solani was reduced in the greenhouse by 51%, 46% and 56%, respectively. In bean seedlings inoculated with B. subtilis (isolate no. 72), B. cereus (isolate no. 78) or B. pumilus (isolate no. 65), disease incidence caused by Sclerotium rolfsii was reduced by 72%, 79% and 26%, respectively, as compared to control. In both cotton and bean seedlings, these endophytes reduced the disease index more than 50%. These results indicate that endophytic bacteria can survive inside cotton plants and are efficient agents for biological control against plant pathogens under greenhouse conditions.","PLEBAN, S; INGEL, F; CHET, I",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY,1995,10.1007/BF01874870,0.968881023121233,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.988375032976243,0.0116249670237571,0.999999285003993,7.14996006734303e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Colonization frequencies of needles are more important in the autumnal and spring periods for major identified fungi. In addition, a specific investigation revealed a high incidence of the symptomatic isolates of Lophodermium cedrinum in Tougurt site which presents the greatest width of Atlas cedar decline in the studied area. The symptomatic forms grow more quickly and have smaller and rudimentary conidia than those of the asymptomatic forms. In addition, the cellulolytic and pectinolytic activities are more important for symptomatic isolates of Tougurt and Telmet site, compared to those of Bordjem.

The volatile flavor substances and organic acids of apple vinegar co-fermented with T. delbrueckii S1 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (experimental) and that fermented with S. cerevisiae (control) were detected by headspace solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively, and their differences in flavor substances were compared through biometric analysis. Heatmap cluster analysis showed that T. delbrueckii S1 had no significant effect on the synthesis of volatile substances in apple vinegar, and the apple vinegars could be well distinguished by orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The results of differential metabolites showed that phenethyl acetate, contributing to the typical apple aroma; and phenyl ethanol, benzaldehyde and benzyl alcohol, contributing to floral and fruity aromas, were more prominent in the experimental group, while ethyl caproate, ethyl decanoate and ethyl laurate, responsible for fruit and laurel oil-like aromas, were more prominent in the control group. The results of co-occurrence network analysis showed that T. delbrueckii S1 could enhance the transmissibility of volatile flavor compounds, and consequently increase the complexity of metabolites. In addition, the box plot of organic acids showed that T. delbrueckii S1 could increase the contents of L-lactic acid, L-malic acid and acetic acid.

E46, which can infect and colonize the aquatic plant Spirodela polyrhiza, utilize fenpropathrin as the sole carbon source for growth. S. polyrhiza helped enhance fenpropathrin degradation by E46 by 17.5%, only slightly improved fenpropathrin degradation by E42, and had no effect on strain E1. The application of plant exudates and extracts from fenpropathrin-unexposed/induced plants stimulated bacterial growth of the three strains, but resulted in differential fenpropathrin degradation, suggesting that not all plants and their endophytic bacteria are suitable for coupling phytoremediation and microbial-remediation.

18035,"Progress and Obstacles in Culturing 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus', the Bacterium Associated with Huanglongbing.","In recent decades, 'Candidatus Liberibacter spp.' have emerged as a versatile group of psyllid-vectored plant pathogens and endophytes capable of infecting a wide range of economically important plant hosts. The most notable example is 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' (CLas) associated with Huanglongbing (HLB) in several major citrus-producing areas of the world. CLas is a phloem-limited α-proteobacterium that is primarily vectored and transmitted among citrus species by the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) Diaphorina citri. HLB was first detected in North America in Florida (USA) in 2005, following introduction of the ACP to the State in 1998. HLB rapidly spread to all citrus growing regions of Florida within three years, with severe economic consequences to growers and considerable expense to taxpayers of the state and nation. Inability to establish CLas in culture (except transiently) remains a significant scientific challenge toward effective HLB management. Lack of axenic cultures has restricted functional genomic analyses, transfer of CLas to either insect or plant hosts for fulfillment of Koch's postulates, characterization of host-pathogen interactions and effective screening of antibacterial compounds. In the last decade, substantial progress has been made toward CLas culturing: (i) three reports of transient CLas cultures were published, (ii) a new species of Liberibacter was identified and axenically cultured from diseased mountain papaya (Liberibacter crescens strain BT-1), (iii) psyllid hemolymph and citrus phloem sap were biochemically characterized, (iv) CLas phages were identified and lytic genes possibly affecting CLas growth were described, and (v) genomic sequences of 15 CLas strains were made available.

On a second assay, plants were subjected to following conditions: absence and presence of strains AB202, AB213 (Burkholderia spp.), BA227, BA234 (Herbaspirillum-like), AB202 plus BA227, AB213 plus BA234, the mixture of the four bacterial strain, absence and presence of the Foc; and cultivated in pots filled with autoclaved Haplic Arenosol, during 2 months. The plant association with diazotrophs and the Foc was confirmed, and factors interacted significantly on the most probable number of bacteria and the colony forming units of the pathogen on roots and plant rhizomes. The potential of the endophytes on the inhibition of Foc propagate units and on the plant growth promotion was demonstrated. The higher biomass was observed four and 2 months after plant inoculation with AB202 and BA234. Results showed that these endophytes may be used as potential biofertilizer and biocontrol agents. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Weber O.B.; Muniz C.R.; Vitor A.O.; Freire F.C.O.; Oliveira V.M.,Plant and Soil,2007,10.1007/s11104-007-9335-0,0.976871560774713,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.983435794284693,0.0165642057153074,0.999993424524932,6.57547506810463e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2374,A fungal endophyte increases plant resilience to low nutrient availabilities: a case of Fe acquisition in legumes,"Microbial inocula are considered a promising and effective alternative solution to the use of chemical fertilizers to support plant growth and productivity since they play a key role in the availability and uptake of nutrients. Here, the effect of a beneficial of a fungal root endophyte, Fusarium solani strain K (FsK), on nutrient acquisition efficiency of the legume Lotus japonicus was studied, and putative mode-of-action of the endophyte at a molecular level was determined. Plant colonization with the endophyte resulted in increased shoot and root fresh weight under Fe deficiency compared to control nutrient conditions. Plant inoculation with FsK was associated with a significant increase in macro- and micronutrient concentration in leaves at an early stage of endophyte inoculation and a replenishment of Fe content under prolonged iron starvation. The mechanistic basis of the plant growth promotion capabilities of the endophyte is exerted at the transcriptional level since we recorded changes in the expression levels of genes related to iron uptake in FsK-colonized plants under stress conditions compared to uninoculated plants. In addition, the observed changes in the ethylene biosynthesis-related genes suggest a possible implication of ethylene in the mode of action used by FsK to enhance plant response to nutrient stress conditions. Finally, we demonstrated that the endophyte possesses a reductive high-affinity Fe uptake system and identified a ferric reductase that was induced in planta under Fe deficiency conditions, indicating that this fungal Fe homeostasis mechanism may result in a benefit in nutrient acquisition for the plant as well.","Avramidou, M; Balaktsis, V; Tsiouri, O; Maghrebi, M; Vigani, G; Sergiou, A; Ntelkis, N; Ehaliotis, C; Papadopoulou, KK",PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM,2024,10.1111/ppl.14577,0.976678280598864,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999762690942152,2.3730905784792e-4,0.99999998300802,1.69919799342111e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The anamorphs of Epichloë species have been classified in genus Neotyphodium, the form genus that also includes most asexual Epichloë descendants. A nomenclatural realignment of this monophyletic group into one genus would enhance a broader understanding of the relationships and common features of these grass endophytes. Based on the principle of priority of publication we propose to classify all members of this clade in the genus Epichloë. We have reexamined classification of several described Epichloë and Neotyphodium species and varieties and propose new combinations and states. In this treatment we have accepted 43 unique taxa in Epichloë, including distinct species, subspecies, and varieties. We exclude from Epichloë the two taxa Neotyphodium starrii, as nomen dubium, and Neotyphodium chilense, as an unrelated taxon. © 2014 by The Mycological Society of America.",Leuchtmann A.; Bacon C.W.; Schardl C.L.; White Jr. J.F.; Tadych M.,Mycologia,2014,10.3852/13-251,0.616513390970802,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998274903520598,0.00172509647940207,0.999999999839453,1.6054657603348201e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

Smith (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) fed on young maize colonized with endophytic fungus Beauveria bassiana from South Sumatra, Indonesia","The aim of present research was to evaluate the seed treated effect of endophytic Beauveria bassiana isolated from soil and infected-host cadavers on the growth of S. frugiperda. The three isolates (TaBrPGA, LtApPGA, and TaTtLH) of B. bassiana identified molecularly were used for bioassay. The research confirmed that isolates of B. bassiana isolated from soil and infected-host cadavers of Lepidoptera were endophytic entomopathogenic fungi All isolates of endophytic B. bassiana caused negative effects on the growth of S. frugiperda larvae. TaTtLH isolate of B. bassiana was the most pathogenic isolate (73% of larvae mortality) among the other isolates. B. bassiana in seed treatment could retard the growth of S. frugiperda larvae, pupae, and adults. The endophytic B. bassiana could also kill the pupae and adults of S. frugiperda, and decrease the pupae and adult emergence. Beauveria bassiana could decrease 86% of adult emergence. Beauveria bassiana applied in seed treatment could protect she stored corn seeds and the young maize plant against S. frugiperda. So, endophytic B. bassiana could be recommended to protect the stored corn seeds. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

13086,Endophytic life strategies decoded by genome and transcriptome analyses of the mutualistic root symbiont Piriformospora indica,"Recent sequencing projects have provided deep insight into fungal lifestyle-associated genomic adaptations. Here we report on the 25 Mb genome of the mutualistic root symbiont Piriformospora indica (Sebacinales, Basidiomycota) and provide a global characterization of fungal transcriptional responses associated with the colonization of living and dead barley roots. Extensive comparative analysis of the P. indica genome with other Basidiomycota and Ascomycota fungi that have diverse lifestyle strategies identified features typically associated with both, biotrophism and saprotrophism. The tightly controlled expression of the lifestyle-associated gene sets during the onset of the symbiosis, revealed by microarray analysis, argues for a biphasic root colonization strategy of P. indica. This is supported by a cytological study that shows an early biotrophic growth followed by a cell death-associated phase. About 10% of the fungal genes induced during the biotrophic colonization encoded putative small secreted proteins (SSP), including several lectin-like proteins and members of a P. indica-specific gene family (DELD) with a conserved novel seven-amino acids motif at the C-terminus. Similar to effectors found in other filamentous organisms, the occurrence of the DELDs correlated with the presence of transposable elements in gene-poor repeat-rich regions of the genome. This is the first in depth genomic study describing a mutualistic symbiont with a biphasic lifestyle. Our findings provide a significant advance in understanding development of biotrophic plant symbionts and suggest a series of incremental shifts along the continuum from saprotrophy towards biotrophy in the evolution of mycorrhizal association from decomposer fungi. © 2011 Zuccaro et al.",Zuccaro A.; Lahrmann U.; Güldener U.; Langen G.; Pfiffi S.; Biedenkopf D.; Wong P.; Samans B.; Grimm C.; Basiewicz M.; Murat C.; Martin F.; Kogel K.-H.,PLoS Pathogens,2011,10.1371/journal.ppat.1002290,0.951466412319442,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.984891954022276,0.0151080459777239,0.999999946388275,5.36117247262879e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6817,"Acclimatization with endophytic fungi and reintroduction of Guarianthe skinneri (Bateman) Dressler & WE Higgins, a threatened, native orchid of cultural value in southern Mexico","The acclimatization of vitroplants into natural conditions represents one of the greatest challenges for the conservation of wild orchids. For more than a century, a wide range of orchid species have been propagated in the laboratory (in vitro), with, when attempted, a low percentage of plants surviving the acclimatization process. We designed a rustic protocol for acclimatization using fungal endophytes of vitroplants for the reintroduction of Guarianthe skinneri into semi-natural habitat. In Phase I (21 days), a total of 640 vitroplants measuring 1-2.8 cm were transplanted onto substrates made from pieces of each of: clay tiles; Cedrela odorata bark, Agave fourcroydes string, and the exocarp of Theobroma bicolor fruits, and then placed into trays with transparent lids. These transplanted vitroplants were inoculated with three selected strains of endophytic fungi previously isolated from mature G. skinneri plants (Nigrospora sp., Coprinellus sp., and Fusarium sp.). In Phase II the growing vitroplants were transplanted onto larger, individual pieces of the same substrates and were hung from the metal frames of galleries open to natural climatic conditions, for 120 days. In Phase III, surviving, acclimatized seedlings were reintroduced onto the branches of cocoa and coffee bushes as phorophytes, in two sites and evaluated at seven months. We observed 59.1 % (378/640 plants) survival at the end of Phase I, decreasing to 15 % (96/640 plants) at the end of Phase II. The survival percentages were higher when the vitroplants came from a previous subculture using Dalla Rosa and Laneri (DRL) culture medium and were then established on pieces of clay tiles or Cedrela odorata bark and inoculated with endophytic fungi. For Phase III, survival at seven months in the site at 80 m was 21.9 % (21 plants), with no surviving plants in the site at 1,100 m. Only 3.3 % of the original 640 vitroplants survived to one year. This is the first rustic acclimatization protocol of G. skinneri vitroplants, using fungal endophytes, aiming towards achieving reintroduction under natural conditions. The protocol requires improvement, specifically to be initiated with larger, more developed vitroplants, and continued study to improve the selection and management of symbiotic endophytic fungi, and will be applied in reintroduction and restoration programs for G. skinneri and other endangered wild epiphytic orchids.

In the present study, in vivo experiments were conducted to determine the physiological responses of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) seedlings by inoculation with an endophytic actinobacterium, Streptomyces thermocarboxydus isolate BPSAC147 under greenhouse conditions. Further, photochemical quantum yield of photosystem II (PSII) (Fv/Fm), photochemical quenching (qP) and non-photochemical (NPQ) were calculated in seedlings inoculated with S. thermocarboxydus (T1) and were compared with control (T0) plants. Furthermore, the electron transport rate (ETR) of PSII exhibited a significant increase in T1 plants, relative to T0 plants. These results indicate that inoculation of tomato seedlings with S. thermocarboxydus had a positive effect on the process of photosynthesis, resulting in enhanced chlorophyll fluorescence parameters due to increased ETR in the thylakoid membrane.

14274,Influence of macerating enzyme - Cellulase on the extraction of valuable compounds: Carotenoid and camptothecin,"Macerating enzymes breaks long chain compounds during maceration for extraction of industrially important phytomolecules. Cellulase is an important class of enzyme which helps in the extraction process of phytomolecules such as carotenoids, camptothecin from their natural sources as macerating enzyme. The extraction of phytoconstituents like carotenoids, camptothecin holds high commercial value. The uses of macerating enzymes help to the extraction process of phytomolecules and increase its yield. Quality of the product is also improved in terms of stability, texture and viscosity. Camptothecin is an important drug with potential anticancer activity. In this work, the effect of cellulase on the extraction of carotenoid from carrot, tomato and sweet potato have been studied. As a pioneer work, the production of camptothecin from endophytic fungi Aspergillus niger has been carried out using cellulase. The quantitative analysis of pharmaceutical important phytomolecules such as carotenoids and camptothecin were performed using UV-Visible spectrophotometer, HPLC with respective standard compounds. Carotenoid extraction was made from tomato, carrot and sweet potato with cellulose enzyme found 2.5±0.25µg/g, 2.2 ±0.18µg/g, 18± 1.75 µg/g respectively. Carotenoid extracted from carrot using enzyme yielded 1.47 times higher amount of carotenoid than that of without enzyme. Carotenoid extracted from tomato, showed the maximum difference of being 7.3 times higher with enzyme than without enzyme. The another industrially important phytomolecule camptothecin extraction was made from Aspergillus niger with cellulase enzyme yielded 0.5512 mg/g which is more than the camptothecin, extracted without enzyme (0.175 mg/g). Thus, it was observed that the use of cellulase enhanced the yield of both carotenoid and camptothecin from natural sources such as plants and fungi. © 2018 Pharmascope Publications.

4870,Increased abundance of secreted hydrolytic enzymes and secondary metabolite gene clusters define the genomes of latent plant pathogens in the Botryosphaeriaceae,"BackgroundThe Botryosphaeriaceae are important plant pathogens, but also have the ability to establish asymptomatic infections that persist for extended periods in a latent state. In this study, we used comparative genome analyses to shed light on the genetic basis of the interactions of these fungi with their plant hosts. For this purpose, we characterised secreted hydrolytic enzymes, secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters and general trends in genomic architecture using all available Botryosphaeriaceae genomes, and selected Dothideomycetes genomes.ResultsThe Botryosphaeriaceae genomes were rich in carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), proteases, lipases and secondary metabolic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) compared to other Dothideomycete genomes. The genomes of Botryosphaeria, Macrophomina, Lasiodiplodia and Neofusicoccum, in particular, had gene expansions of the major constituents of the secretome, notably CAZymes involved in plant cell wall degradation. The Botryosphaeriaceae genomes were shown to have moderate to high GC contents and most had low levels of repetitive DNA. The genomes were not compartmentalized based on gene and repeat densities, but genes of secreted enzymes were slightly more abundant in gene-sparse regions.ConclusionThe abundance of secreted hydrolytic enzymes and secondary metabolite BGCs in the genomes of Botryosphaeria, Macrophomina, Lasiodiplodia, and Neofusicoccum were similar to those in necrotrophic plant pathogens and some endophytes of woody plants. The results provide a foundation for comparative genomic analyses and hypotheses to explore the mechanisms underlying Botryosphaeriaceae host-plant interactions.","Nagel, JH; Wingfield, MJ; Slippers, B",BMC GENOMICS,2021,10.1186/s12864-021-07902-w,0.93398169564375,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999726149171045,2.738508289547e-4,0.999998791442875,1.20855712504309e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Epichloe gansuensis, seed-borne endophytic fungi, establishes a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with Achnatherum inebrians and confers salt tolerance in the host plants. In this study, analysis of transcriptome and metabolome was used to explore the potential molecular mechanism underlying the salt-adaptation of A. inebrians roots mediated by E. gansuensis. We found that E. gansuensis played an important role in the gene expression of the host's roots and regulated multiple pathways involved in amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, TCA cycle, secondary metabolism, and lipid metabolism in the roots of A. inebrians. Importantly, E. gansuensis significantly induced the biological processes, including exocytosis, glycolytic process, fructose metabolic process, and potassium ion transport in roots of host plants at transcriptional levels, and altered the pathways, including inositol phosphate metabolism, galactose metabolism, starch, and sucrose metabolism at metabolite levels under NaCl stress. These findings provided insight into the molecular mechanism of salt resistance in roots of A. inebrians mediated by E. gansuensis and could drive progress in the cultivation of new salt-resistance breeds with endophytes.","Wang, C; Huang, R; Wang, JF; Jin, J; Malik, K; Niu, XL; Tang, R; Hou, WP; Cheng, C; Liu, YL; Liu, J",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2022,10.3390/jof8101092,0.947180945969386,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998215042470883,0.00178495752911708,0.999999523815769,4.76184230713272e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

14986,"Optimization of culture conditions for the production, antifungal activity and characterization of secondary metabolites of Trichoderma longibrachiatum","The present study was intended to optimize the culture conditions for secondary metabolite production by endophytic fungi. Based on the morphology and phylogeny, the fungus was identified as Trichoderma longibrachiatum isolated from brinjal leaf based on morphological characterization. The antifungal activity was evaluated against phytopathogens such as Macrophomina phaseolina, Phytopthora infestans, Colletotrichum falcatum and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides through the overlapping method, culture filtrate and organic fraction from Potato dextrose both as a growth medium. The organic fraction exhibited a significant antifungal activity, while modifications in medium composition may possess a major impact on the quantity and quality of secondary metabolites production. To achieve maximum metabolite production, the growth of the culture was optimized with screening of basal media, carbon, nitrogen, pH, trace elements and incubation period. The final optimized fermentation conditions were Minimal ereavis broth as basal media; glucose and sucrose as carbon source; Peptone and Yeast extract as nitrogen source, sodium nitrate as precursor; pH as 6; and incubation period as 7 days at 28°C. This optimization resulted in antifungal activity of 47.19-60.67% against M. phaseolina, P. infestans, C. falcatum, and C. gloeosporioides which was higher than that before optimization (43.80%).

7524,The Beneficial Endophytic Fungus Fusarium solani Strain K Alters Tomato Responses Against Spider Mites to the Benefit of the Plant,"Beneficial microorganisms are known to promote plant growth and confer resistance to biotic and abiotic stressors. Soil-borne beneficial microbes in particular have shown potential in protecting plants against pathogens and herbivores via the elicitation of plant responses. In this study, we evaluated the role of Fusarium solani strain K (FsK) in altering plant responses to the two spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae in tomato. We found evidence that FsK, a beneficial endophytic fungal strain isolated from the roots of tomato plants grown on suppressive compost, affects both direct and indirect tomato defenses against spider mites. Defense-related genes were differentially expressed on FsK-colonized plants after spider mite infestation compared to clean or spider mite-infested un-colonized plants. In accordance, spider mite performance was negatively affected on FsK-colonized plants and feeding damage was lower on these compared to control plants. Notably, FsK-colonization led to increased plant biomass to both spider mite-infested and un-infested plants. FsK was shown to enhance indirect tomato defense as FsK-colonized plants attracted more predators than un-colonized plants. In accordance, headspace volatile analysis revealed significant differences between the volatiles emitted by FsK-colonized plants in response to attack by spider mites. Our results highlight the role of endophytic fungi in shaping plant-mite interactions and may offer the opportunity for the development of a novel tool for spider mite control.","Pappas, ML; Liapoura, M; Papantoniou, D; Avramidou, M; Kavroulakis, N; Weinhold, A; Broufas, GD; Papadopoulou, KK",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2018,10.3389/fpls.2018.01603,0.962163949174869,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.940332767499918,0.0596672325000815,0.999989958119339,1.00418806613378e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

15947,"Isolation, identification and characterization of endophytic fungi of bambusa oldhamii munro applied as antagonists to pyricularia oryzae","Endophytic fungi, in addition to improving plant development, may produce antimicrobial substances that can inhibit pathogens. The objective of this study was to isolate and characterize endophytic fungi of Bambusa oldhamii and evaluate in vitro antagonism to Pyricularia oryzae. Fungal isolates of B. oldhamii shoots were purified and identified by nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) including internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1 and ITS4). These isolates were then confirmed by phylogenetic analysis of the ITS1 and ITS2 sequences and morphological analysis. The isolates were evaluated in in vitro experiments of direct and indirect antagonism (volatile production). Five fungal isolates were identified and named as follows: isolate 27 (Arthrinium sp.); isolate 29 (Acrocalymma sp.); isolate 122 (Botryobambusa fusicoccum); isolate 711 (Phoma sp.) and isolate 712 (Phoma sp.). We found that the area of the P. oryzae colony was reduced by more than 80% by all endophytic isolates in this study, with emphasis on isolate 122, with a 96% reduction in area of the P. oryzae.

In this study, we investigated the root microbiome of tomato in association with infection by root knot nematodes. Our objectives were to observe the effects and response of the bacterial endophytes before nematode attacks and to reveal the functional attributes of microbes in plant health and nematode pathogenesis. Community analysis of root-associated microbiomes in healthy and nematode-infected tomatoes indicated that nematode infections were associated with variation and differentiation of the endophyte and rhizosphere bacterial populations in plant roots. The community of the resident endophytes in tomato root was significantly affected by nemato-pathogenesis. Remarkably, some bacterial groups in the nematode feeding structure, the root gall, were specifically enriched, suggesting an association with nematode pathogenesis. Function-based metagenomic analysis indicated that the enriched bacterial populations in root gall harbored abundant genes related to degradation of plant polysaccharides, carbohydrate and protein metabolism, and biological nitrogen fixation.

1156,Nutritional requirements for growth of fungal endophytes of grasses,"Fifteen isolates of fungal endophytes of grasses were studied for their ability to metabolize different sources of carbon and nitrogen. These endophytes had been isolated from 12 different species of Poaceae and included Clavicipitaceae with or without a teleomorph (genera Epichloe and Neotyphodium, respectively) and species belonging to the genus Acremonium sensu stricto (Acremonium chilense-like). Pectin and cellulose as carbon sources and tryptophan and methionine as nitrogen sources appeared to support poorly the growth of most isolates. Hexoses, disaccharides, complex nitrogen sources, asparagine, and glutamine supported growth of all isolates. The isolates of genus Neotyphodium were characterized by limited growth whatever the substrate, the inhibition of their growth by high concentrations of glucose and fructose, and their inability to assimilate pentoses (xylose, arabinose) and nitrates. The isolates of genus Epichloe showed better growth than those of the previous group and their growth was not inhibited by high concentrations of glucose, but they were also unable to use pentoses. The Acremonium chilense-like isolates showed rapid growth and were distinguished by their ability to use the pentoses and nitrates. Zn contrast, they showed relatively poor growth on methionine and alanine as nitrogen sources. They showed the most rapid growth on high concentrations of glucose or fructose.","Naffaa, W; Ravel, C; Guillaumin, JJ",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY,1998,10.1139/cjm-44-3-231,0.993836164851686,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996890727906848,0.00310927209315237,0.999999999994692,5.30775423612795e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11193,The Genes Associated with Jasmonic Acid and Salicylic Acid Are Induced in Tropical Chili Pepper against Ralstonia solanacearum by Applying Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi,"Controlling soil-borne pathogens is a significant problem in agriculture. Arbuscular mycorrhizae have a potential role in controlling soil-borne pathogens by increasing plant phytohormone contents. However, the mechanism of resistance by mycorrhizae has not been fully elucidated, particularly against bacterial wilt disease in Solanaceae. This study examined the role of mycorrhizae in expressing genes involved in the signaling pathways mediated by jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) in tropical chili pepper against the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum. Seedlings from ten genotypes of chili pepper were inoculated with a consortium of five mycorrhizal species and/or inoculated with a mixture of nine isolates of R. solanacearum. The leaves of 10-week-old plants after the treatment were sampled for real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. The results showed that the mycorrhizae strengthened the immune system of tropical chili pepper by increasing the relative gene expression levels of JA and SA in genotypes with high and low responsiveness to the mycorrhizae. The relative gene expression level of JA was related to the percentage colonization of mycorrhizae and the resistance of the tropical chili pepper genotypes to R. solanacearum. The relative gene expression level of SA was associated with the resistance of tropical chili pepper to R. solanacearum.","Ambarwati, E; Arwiyanto, T; Widada, J; Alam, T; Andika, I; Taryono",HORTICULTURAE,2022,10.3390/horticulturae8100876,0.583973781057399,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997265995972286,0.00273400402771374,0.999999910253454,8.9746546305669e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

15823,Different response of Alyssum montanum and Helianthus annuus to cadmium bioaccumulation mediated by the endophyte fungus Serendipita indica,"Environmental pollution by heavy metals is a severe issue worldwide. Microbe-assisted phytoremediation is a safe, inexpensive, and promising strategy in refinement of metal-polluted regions. Current in vitro work was installed to study effects of the endophytic fungus Serendipita indica on some physiological traits and cadmium (Cd) bioaccumulation of Alyssum montanum and Helianthus annuus seedlings grown in MS medium, under varying levels of Cd (0, 20, 40 and 60 mg Cd/l medium). Even though Cd stress induced phyto-toxicity in both tested species, but a significant improvement was found in biomass accumulation, photosynthetic pigments content, and chlorophyll fluorescence indicators in inoculated seedlings by S. indica under different doses of Cd in media. The non-infected A. montanum plantlets accumulated more Cd in shoot than root, and illustrated the properties of an accumulator species as evidenced by translocation factor (TF) and bioaccumulation factor of shoot (BFS) higher than 1. Contrary to this, un-colonized H. annuus seedlings had higher amount of Cd in root than shoot and showed a phyto-stabilizer feature, as evidenced by TF 1 and bioaccumulation factor of root (BFR) higher than 1. Presence of S. indica significantly enhanced Cd accumulation in root, while it noticeably diminished Cd amounts of shoot in both A. montanum and H. annuus seedlings, so that inoculated plants had higher values for BFR against lower values for BFS and TF, in compare to non-inoculated ones. These findings indicated that S. indica can be considered as a bio-fertilizer to improve the physiological characteristics of tested species under Cd stress, as well as a bio-stabilizer of Cd in the roots of A. montanum and H. annuus in the regions exposed to toxic levels of Cd. © 2019 Ecological Society of China.

4732,Endophytic Beauvea bassiana increases galling of 'Rutgers' tomato roots with Meloidogyne incognita,"Beauveria bassiana is endophytic in many plant species and has been shown to protect host plants against insect pests and plant pathogens. However, less is known about its activity against plant-parasitic nematodes. In vitro and plant assays were conducted to determine the effect of B. bassiana 11-98 (Bb) on Meloidogyne incognita (root-knot nematode; RKN). Beauveria bassiana was confirmed as an endophyte in 'Rutgers' tomato and colonization patterns of Bb in 'Rutgers' (highly susceptible to RKN) were compared with those in 'Mountain Spring' (less susceptible to RKN). In greenhouse tests with 'Rutgers' at 30 and 60 days after treatment (DAT) with RKN and Bb, there were few differences in plant growth variables among treatments in repeated trials. However, RKN root galling and egg count/root system were enhanced in plants treated with Bb at 60 DAT. In an in vitro assay with egg masses from greenhouse tests, the percentages of hatched eggs, and mobile and immobile nematodes did not differ significantly for RKN and RKN+Bb treatments. The presence of viable Bb from roots was confirmed by collecting egg suspensions from root galls and plating them on selective medium. Colonies of Bb were verified on agar medium, but no parasitism of RKN eggs was observed. Research is needed to investigate factors responsible for increased galling by RKN in the presence of endophytic Bb in 'Rutgers' tomato.","Yerukala, S; Bernard, EC; Gwinn, KD; Butler, DM; Grewal, PS; Ownley, BH",JOURNAL OF NEMATOLOGY,2021,10.21307/jofnem-2021-072,0.949742589597548,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999555949505058,4.4405049494191e-4,0.999999999940612,5.93879390109464e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

5109,Food soiling and diet discrimination of mouse lines divergently selected for response to a nutritional toxicosis,"Mouse lines were selected for eight generations for resistance (R) versus susceptibility (S) to growth depression from toxins in endophyte-infected tall fescue seed. To examine a possible correlated response to that selection, three experiments subsequently were conducted to examine food soiling behaviour of the mice. In Experiment 1, the average food soiling score was higher for R mice than S mice; but males had higher scores than females and soiling of the toxin-containing diet (T+) was greater than soiling of the non-toxin-containing diet (T-) only in the R line. When all mice received the T- diet during the first two weeks of Experiment 2, neither line, sex nor their interaction affected food soiling scores. During the second two weeks of Experiment 2, R mice had higher average food soiling scores than S mice on both the T- and the T+ diet; but within the R line, neither sex, diet nor their interaction significantly affected food soiling scores. In Experiment 3, when all mice had simultaneous access to both diets, bowls containing the T- diet were more heavily soiled than bowls containing the T+ diet, lines did not differ in soiling of the two diets, but males expressed greater diet soiling differences than females. In summary, after eight generations of divergent selection for growth depression from ingestion of fungal toxins, resistant and susceptible lines differed in food soiling behaviour, but not consistently across experiments. Differences could be attributable to genetic drift but might also represent correlated selection response in social, nutritional or emotional aspects of eliminative behaviour. Speculations about the biological and behavioural bases for observed differences may lead to testable hypotheses about how toxicosis resistance is inherited and expressed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

777,"Production of paclitaxel with anticancer activity by two local fungal endophytes, Aspergillus fumigatus and Alternaria tenuissima","Among 60 fungal endophytes isolated from twigs, bark, and mature leaves of different plant species, two fungal isolates named TXD105 and TER995 were capable of producing paclitaxel in amounts of up to 84.41 and 37.92 mu g L-1, respectively. Based on macroscopic and microscopic characteristics, ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA sequence, and phylogenetic characteristic analysis, the two respective isolates were identified as Aspergillus fumigatus and Alternaria tenuissima. In the effort to increase paclitaxel magnitude by the two fungal strains, several fermentation conditions including selection of the proper fermentation medium, agitation rate, incubation temperature, fermentation period, medium pH, medium volume, and inoculum nature (size and age of inoculum) were tried. Fermentation process carried out in M1D medium (pH 6.0) and maintained at 120 rpm for 10 days and at 25 A degrees C using 4% (v/v) inoculum of 5-day-old culture stimulated the highest paclitaxel production to attain 307.03 mu g L-1 by the A. fumigatus strain. In the case of the A. tenuissima strain, fermentation conditions conducted in flask basal medium (pH 6.0) and maintained at 120 rpm for 14 days and at 25 A degrees C using 8% (v/v) inoculum of 7-day-old culture were found the most favorable to attain the highest paclitaxel production of 124.32 mu g L-1. Using the MTT-based assay, fungal paclitaxel significantly inhibited the proliferation of five different cancer cell lines with 50% inhibitory concentration values varied from 3.04 to 14.8 mu g mL(-1). Hence, these findings offer new and alternate sources with excellent biotechnological potential for paclitaxel production by fungal fermentation.","Ismaiel, AA; Ahmed, AS; Hassan, IA; El-Sayed, ESR; El-Din, AAK",APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,2017,10.1007/s00253-017-8354-x,0.980163992371029,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995174616979321,0.00482538302067929,0.999999999678731,3.2126923343867004e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

9268,Plant immune inducer ZNC promotes rutin accumulation and enhances resistance to Botrytis cinerea in tomato,"Gray mold is a destructive disease caused by Botrytis cinerea, a pervasive plant pathogen, which poses a threat to both tomato growth and postharvest storage. The utilization of induced resistance presents a potential strategy for combating plant pathogenic attacks. ZNC (zhinengcong), an extract derived from the endophytic fungus Paecilomyces variotii, has been discovered to play a vital role in preventing diverse forms of bacterial infections. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism behind its ability to enhance tomato resistance to fungi remains unclear. In this study, we found that the exogenous spraying of ZNC could significantly improve the resistance of tomato plants to B. cinerea. The results of both the metabolomic analysis and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) demonstrated that tomato plants responded to ZNC treatment by accumulating high levels of rutin. Additional transcriptome analysis uncovered that rutin enhances tomato resistance possible by initiating the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs) related genes expression during the initial phase of invasion by B. cinerea. In addition, we also found that rutin might activate plant immunity by eliciting ethylene (ET) and jasmonic acid (JA)-mediated pathways. Therefore, plant immune inducer ZNC and rutin has bright application prospects and high utilization value to control gray mold.","Zhao, HP; Ding, XY; Chu, XM; Zhang, HM; Wang, XY; Zhang, XW; Liu, HQ; Zhang, XY; Yin, ZY; Li, Y; Ding, XH",STRESS BIOLOGY,2023,10.1007/s44154-023-00106-0,0.985993705326384,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.977222898643567,0.0227771013564326,0.999997794985746,2.20501425385322e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19425,Spread and driving factors of antibiotic resistance genes in soil-plant system in long-term manured greenhouse under lead (Pb) stress.,"Livestock manure is often used as fertilizer in greenhouses, resulting in simultaneous enrichment of heavy metals and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soils. The soil-plant system is a non-negligible way to spread ARGs; however, the effects of lead (Pb) on the spread of ARGs and their driving factors in the greenhouse soil-plant system remain unclear. In this present study, the occurrence of ARGs in greenhouse soils and their spread into plants under Pb stress were studied. Overall, Pb promoted the accumulation of ARGs in root endophytes at 10, 50, and 100 mg/kg as well as in soils at 10 and 200 mg/kg, but reduced the total relative abundance of ARGs in leaf endophytes. Particularly, Pb increased the mobile genetic elements (MGEs) relative abundance and endophytic bacterial community diversity in roots, consistent with the change in the total relative abundance of ARGs. Network analysis revealed that bacterial community and MGEs may jointly affect the migration of ARGs in the soil-plant system of greenhouses.

In this study, the diversity of foliar endophytic fungi (FEF) of the southern temperate tree Embothriumcoccineum (Proteaceae), as well as their role in plant protection in nature was determined. Fungal endophytes were isolated from 40 asymptomatic leaves by the culture method for molecular identification of the 18S rRNA gene. A relationship between FEF frequency and plant protection was evaluated in juveniles of E. coccineum. Fungal endophyte frequency was estimated using real-time PCR analyses to determine endophyte DNA content per plant. A total of 178 fungal isolates were identified, with sequence data revealing 34 different operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A few common taxa dominated the fungal endophyte community, whereas most taxa qualified as rare. A significant positive correlation between plant protection (evaluated in terms of percentage of leaf damage) and FEF frequency was found. Furthermore, in vitro confrontation assays indicated that FEF were able to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens. The data showed a relatively high diversity of fungal endophytes associated with leaves of E. coccineum, and suggest a positive relationship between fungal endophyte frequencies in leaves and host protection in nature.","González-Teuber, M",AOB PLANTS,2016,10.1093/aobpla/plw050,0.952963697387821,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.937640791389854,0.0623592086101463,0.99993733552437,6.2664475630303e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

6120,"Metabolites of endophytic fungi isolated from leaves of Bauhinia variegata exhibit antioxidant activity and agonist activity on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α, β/δ and γ","Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that affects millions of people worldwide and is linked to oxidative stress and inflammation. Thiazolidinediones (TZD) improve insulin sensitization and glucose homeostasis mediated by the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPAR gamma) in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, their use is associated with severe adverse effects such as loss of bone mass, retention of body fluids, liver and heart problems, and increased risk of bladder cancer. Partial PPAR gamma agonists can promote the beneficial effects of thiazolidinediones with fewer adverse effects. Endophytic fungi colonize plant tissues and have a particularly active metabolism caused by the interaction with them, which leads to the production of natural products with significant biological effects that may be like that of the colonized plant. Here, we identify seven endophytic fungi isolated from Bauhinia variegata leaves that have antioxidant activities. Also, one of the extracts presented pan-agonist activity on PPAR, and another showed activity in PPAR alpha and PPAR beta/delta. A better understanding of this relationship could help to comprehend the mechanism of action of antioxidants in treating diabetes and its complications. Moreover, compounds with these capabilities to reduce oxidative stress and activate the receptor that promotes glucose homeostasis are promising candidates in treatment of diabetes.","Mesquita, PG; de Araujo, LM; Neves, FDR; Borin, MD",FRONTIERS IN FUNGAL BIOLOGY,2022,10.3389/ffunb.2022.1049690,0.99164098027318,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999837027217655,1.6297278234466e-4,0.999999969723099,3.02769007642922e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

This research aimed to assess the effect of young maize inoculated with endophytic fungi on the development of S. frugiperda. The fungal isolates used for the bioassay were Beauveria bassiana JgSPK isolate (GenBank acc. no. MZ356494), B. bassiana JgCrJr isolate (GenBank acc. no. MZ356497), and Metarhizium anisopliae CaTpPga isolates (GenBank acc. no. MZ242073). Beauveria bassiana (JgSPK and JgCrJr isolates) and M. anisopliae (CaTpPga isolate) colonized young maize plant significantly reduced the pupae and adult emergence, adult longevity, eggs laid, and viable eggs of S. frugiperda. The fungi also significantly enhanced larval mortality compared to non-colonized ones. The larval mortality caused by M. anisopliae CaTpPga isolate (57.67%) was highest among other treatments but not significantly different from those treated with B. bassiana JgSPK isolate (51.33%). Furthermore, the developmental time (eggs, larvae, pupae stages, and lifespan) of S. frugiperda fed on leaves colonized with endophytic fungi significantly increased compared to non-colonized ones. So, B. bassiana and M. anisopliae inoculated as seed treatments caused negative effects on the development of S. frugiperda. These findings highlight the potential of endophytic B. bassiana and M. anisopliae from South Sumatra to protect maize against S. frugiperda. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

15405,"Evaluation of Antibacterial Activity, Total Phenolic and Flavonoid Contents of Extracts of Endophytic Fungi Associated with Tinospora crispa (L.) Hook. f. & Thomson","In the preliminary study, endophytic fungi associated with Tinospora crispa have been reported as antibacterial that assayed by TLC-bioautography. While more comprehensive studies for antibacterial activity using microdilution, total phenolic, flavonoid contents, and their relationship of extracts of fungal endophytes from this plant have never been investigated yet. This research aims to assess antibacterial activity, total phenolic, total flavonoid, and their relationship of fungal extracts associated with T. crispa. Based on morphological identification, this study revealed that endophytic Phomopsis sp. is the most isolated fungi (35% of fungal isolate composition). Based on the microdilution method, morphological and molecular identification showed that the fungal extracts performing a vigorous antibacterial activity (MIC value: <64 μg.ml-1) against S. aureus InaCC-B4 were three extracts i.e., Colletotrichum brevisporum TcDn1Bd-01, and Diaporthe passifloricola TcBt2Bo-03, and Alternaria alstroemeriae TcTd2Bo-07. While one extracts, Phomopsis sp. TcBt1Bo-06, have potent bacterial growth inhibition toward E. coli InaCC-B5 (MIC value: <64 μg.ml-1). The highest of both total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) values of the extract is A. alstroemeriae TcTd2Bo07 which are 166.210 ± 0.000 GAE/extract (mg/g) and 339.991 ± 0.136 QE/extract (mg/g), respectively. There is a negative and significantly very high Pearson’s correlation TPC values toward the MIC value of antibacterial against S. aureus and E. coli (r = -0.671 and -0.969, respectively, P<0.01).

3114,Carbon for nutrient exchange between Lycopodiella inundata and Mucoromycotina fine root endophytes is unresponsive to high atmospheric CO2,"Non-vascular plants associating with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AMF) and Mucoromycotina 'fine root endophyte' (MFRE) fungi derive greater benefits from their fungal associates under higher atmospheric [CO2] (a[CO2]) than ambient; however, nothing is known about how changes in a[CO2] affect MFRE function in vascular plants. We measured movement of phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) between the lycophyte Lycopodiella inundata and Mucoromycotina fine root endophyte fungi using P-33-orthophosphate, (15) N-ammonium chloride and (CO2)-C-14 isotope tracers under ambient and elevated a[CO2] concentrations of 440 and 800 ppm, respectively. Transfers of P-33 and (15) N from MFRE to plants were unaffected by changes in a[CO2]. There was a slight increase in C transfer from plants to MFRE under elevated a[CO2]. Our results demonstrate that the exchange of C-for-nutrients between a vascular plant and Mucoromycotina FRE is largely unaffected by changes in a[CO2]. Unravelling the role of MFRE in host plant nutrition and potential C-for-N trade changes between symbionts under different abiotic conditions is imperative to further our understanding of the past, present and future roles of plant-fungal symbioses in ecosystems.","Hoysted, GA; Kowal, J; Pressel, S; Duckett, JG; Bidartondo, MI; Field, KJ",MYCORRHIZA,2021,10.1007/s00572-021-01033-6,0.96057717978455,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999963605332686,3.63946673135952e-5,0.999999999943134,5.6865734343603e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6894,Application of Stemphylium lycopersici Extracts Immobilized on MCM-48type Mesoporous Materials as Biocatalysts for Monoacylglycerol Production,"Monoacylglycerols are eco-friendly and inexpensive emulsifiers with a range of applications. The traditional synthetic route is not eco-friendly, while enzymatic catalysis offers milder reaction conditions and higher selectivity. However, its application still is limited due to the costs. In this context, endophytic fungi can be source to new biocatalysts with enhanced catalytic activity. Based on this perspective, the aim of this study was perform the synthesis of MAG's through transesterification reactions of solketal and different vinyl esters, using crude and immobilized lipolytic extracts from the endophytic fungi Stemphylium lycopersici, isolated from Humiria balsamifera. The reactions were conducted using 100 mg of biocatalyst, 1 mmol of substrates, 9 : 1 n-heptane/acetone, at 40 degrees C, 200 rpm for 96 h. In the reactions using the ILE and stearate, laureate and decanoate vinyl esters it was possible to obtain the correspondent products with conversion rates of 52-75 %. Also, according to the structure drivers used in MCM-48 synthesis, different morphologies and conversions rates were observed. Employing [C16MI] Cl, [C14MI] Cl and [C4MI] Cl, the 1-lauroyl- glycerol conversion was 36 %, 79 % and 44 %, respectively.

13948,Adaptation of subpopulations of the Norway spruce needle endophyte Lophodermium piceae to the temperature regime,"Lophodermium piceae represents the most common Norway spruce needle endophyte. The aim of this study was to find out whether subpopulations of L. piceae in climatically different environments (in which Norway spruce occurs natively) are adapted to local thermal conditions. L. piceae's ability for thermal adaptation was investigated by determining growth rates of 163 isolates in vitro at four different temperatures: 2, 6, 20 and 25 °C. Isolates were obtained between 1995 and 2010 from apparently healthy needles sampled in Finland, Poland, Switzerland, Italy and southeastern Siberia. The sampling sites represent seven climatically distinct locations. Results were evaluated in relation to the age and geographic origin of the isolate, in addition to the highest and lowest average monthly temperature of the sampling location. We found a significant correlation between the growth rate and the age of the isolate at 25 °C. Variation in growth rates between subpopulations was low compared to within subpopulations. Only at 2 °C did statistically significant differences between the average growth rates of subpopulations emerge. These results suggest that L. piceae covers the whole distribution area of Norway spruce but that generally the thermal reaction norm of its subpopulations has not changed according to local temperature ranges, despite high contrast in thermal conditions across this vast area. Therefore, it would appear that the thermal environment is not a crucial factor in assessing the fitness of this fungal species within the native range of Norway spruce. © 2019 British Mycological Society",Müller M.M.; Hamberg L.; Morozova T.; Sizykh A.; Sieber T.,Fungal Biology,2019,10.1016/j.funbio.2019.09.008,0.97275715847154,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999318059731264,6.8194026873632e-4,0.999996350733271,3.64926672902222e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

By using SA-and JA-impaired mutant lines and exogenous hormonal application, here we investigated whether the SA-and JA-pathways also have a role in T-78 root colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana. Endophytic colonization by T-78 was faster in the SA-impaired mutant sid2 than in the wild type. Moreover, elicitation of SA-dependent defenses by SA application reduced T-78 colonization, indicating that the SA-pathway affects T-78 endophytism. In contrast, elicitation of the JA-pathway, which antagonized SA-dependent defenses, resulted in enhanced endophytic colonization by T-78. These findings are in line with our previous observation that SA-dependent defenses are repressed by T-78, which likely aids colonization by the endophytic fungus.","Martínez-Medina, A; Appels, FVW; van Wees, SCM",PLANT SIGNALING & BEHAVIOR,2017,10.1080/15592324.2017.1345404,0.987335519936421,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.97633832825833,0.0236616717416704,0.999999468286053,5.31713947093948e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Here, we characterized the root fungal communities of field-grown maize and of Panicum from adjacent borders in the Congo Basin and assessed parameters that could shape them. The soil properties indicated that comparable poor soil conditions prevailed in fields and borders, illustrating the low input character of local subsistence farming. The rhizosphere fungal communities, dominated by ascomycetous members, were structured by plant species, slash-and-burn practices and soil P, pH and C/N ratio. Examining fungi with potential plant growth-promoting abilities, the glomeromycotan communities appeared to be affected by the same parameters, whereas the inconspicuous symbionts of the order Sebacinales seemed less susceptible to environmental and anthropogenic factors. Notwithstanding the low abundances at which they were detected, sebacinoids occurred in 87% of the field samples, implying that they represent a consistent taxon within indigenous fungal populations across smallholder farm sites. Pending further insight into their ecosystem functionality, these data suggest that Sebacinales are robust root inhabitants that might be relevant for on-farm inoculum development within sustainable soil fertility management in the Sub-Saharan region.","Venneman, J; De Tender, C; Debode, J; Audenaert, K; Baert, G; Vermeir, P; Cremelie, P; Bekaert, B; Landschoot, S; Thienpondt, B; Djailo, BD; Vereecke, D; Haesaert, G",FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY,2019,10.1093/femsec/fiz101,0.982635112503632,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995832940495271,0.00416705950472886,0.999999995387161,4.61283866659556e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The current paper reports Muscodor tigerii as a novel endophytic fungus from the stem internal tissue of Cinnamomum camphora growing in the Tiger Hill area of Darjeeling, West Bengal, India. M. tigerii exhibited distinct morphological, molecular and physiological features than previously reported Muscodor species. The fungus possesses all the morphological features described till date in genus Muscodor making it remarkably unique. The strong fruity smell of the fungus is attributed to 22 volatile organic compounds (VOCs), predominantly 4-Octadecylmorpholine, 1-Tetradecanamine,N,N-dimethyl and 1,2-Benzenedicarboxylic acid, mono(2-ethylhexyl) ester. The in vitro VOC stress assay completely suppressed the growth of Alternaria alternata and Cercospora beticola while growth of other fungal species was inhibited in a range of 10 %-70 %. The growth of Candida albicans in the presence of VOC was reduced by 50 %-65 % while in bacteria 50 %-80 % reduction in growth was observed. Thus, M. tigerii stands as a potential candidate to be further developed into a biocontrol agent.","Saxena, S; Meshram, V; Kapoor, N",ANNALS OF MICROBIOLOGY,2015,10.1007/s13213-014-0834-y,0.983371323607129,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996183157072959,0.00381684292704108,0.999999939559219,6.04407809356999e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Nevertheless, the tea phyllosphere harbours a variety of endophytes that are highly effective at degrading polyaromatic hydrocarbons, anthracene, and pyrene. The present study attempts to analyse the pyrene and anthracene degrading capability of phyllosphere endophytic fungi that inhabit Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze leaves. The frequency of occurrence of endophytic fungi in different leaf tissue layers was examined using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The best pyrene and anthracene degrading strains were selected based on the High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) results, and further kinetic assays. Light microscopy and SEM observations highlighted a heterogeneous endophytic fungal distribution among leaf tissue layers; the upper epidermis had the highest fungal distribution compared to other leaf layers. HPLC results revealed that Phyllosticta capitalensis, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Colletotrichum siamense, Pseudopestalotiopsis chinensis, and Daldinia eschscholtzii, have higher pyrene and anthracene degradation respectively and their PAH degradation kinetics follow the first-order kinetic model.

According to the NGS analysis, 12 taxa of class level were presented in different grapevine organs (stem, leaf, berry, seed). Among the 12 taxa, sequences of two fungal classes were the most represented: Dothideomycetes-60% and Tremellomycetes-33%. The top five taxa included Vishniacozyma, Aureobasidiaceae, Cladosporium, Septoria and Papiliotrema. The highest number of fungal isolates and sequences were detected in the grape leaves. The present data also revealed that lower temperatures and increased precipitation favored the number and diversity of endophytic fungi in the wild Amur grape. The number of fungi recovered from grape tissues in autumn was two times higher than in summer. Thus, this study is the first to describe and analyze the biodiversity of the endophytic fungal community in wild grapevine V. amurensis.","Aleynova, OA; Nityagovsky, NN; Suprun, AR; Ananev, AA; Dubrovina, AS; Kiselev, K",PLANTS-BASEL,2022,10.3390/plants11212897,0.98958528967958,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.5719867330296,0.4280132669704,0.999999999855144,1.44856238115665e-10,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

19008,Differential responses of bell pepper genotypes to indigenous Pseudomonas putida A32 treatment: implications for drought resilience.,"This study aimed to evaluate the potential of endophytic plant growth-promoting bacterium (PGPB), Pseudomonas putida A32, to mitigate drought stress in two bell pepper genotypes, Amfora 19 and Amfora 26, and to assess the genotype-specific responses to bacterial treatment. The isolate P. putida A32 was selected for its remarkable beneficial properties, exhibiting 13 out of 14 traits tested. Under drought conditions, Amfora 26 showed increased relative water content and decreased H2O2 and malondialdehyde following bacterial treatment, while Amfora 19 exhibited enhanced growth parameters but responded less to bacterial treatment regarding drought parameters. However, Amfora 19 displayed inherent drought tolerance mechanisms, as indicated by lower stress parameters compared to Amfora 26. The study emphasizes the importance of genotype-specific responses to PGPB treatment and the mechanisms of drought tolerance in peppers. Pseudomonas putida A32 effectively mitigated drought stress in both genotypes, with differential responses influenced by plant genotype. Our study confirmed our initial hypothesis that Amfora 19, as a genotype tolerant to biotic stress, is also more tolerant to abiotic stress. Understanding these interactions is crucial for the development of customized strategies to improve plant productivity and tolerance to drought.",Mesaroš A; Atanasković I; Nedeljković M; Stanković S; Lozo J,Journal of applied microbiology,2024,10.1093/jambio/lxae190,0.943376894479438,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.955362231400771,0.0446377685992288,0.999999950144637,4.98553625050135e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
20732,Physiological ecological effect of endophyte infection on Achnatherum sibiricum under drought stress,"Endophytes and their host grasses are mutually symbiotic. On one hand, the host grasses provide necessary photosynthates for the fungi; on the other hand, endophyte-infected grasses express a range of adaptations to biotic and abiotic stresses, including drought, mineral imbalance, and soil acidity. Cool-season grasses infected with Neotyphodium endophytes have an extraordinary impact on the ecology and economy of pasture and turf. In this paper, Achnatherum sibiricum infected by Neotyphodium lolii was employed to establish endophyte-free (EF) and endophyte-infected (EI) populations. EI and EF Achnatherum sibiricum were grown in the field and tested for their ecophysiolocal response to water deficiency. Relative water content (RWC), chlorophyll, soluble sugar and protective enzymes of EI and EF populations under normal and drought stress conditions were calculated. The experiment was carried out on the campus of Nankai University, Tianjin. The stress treatment began in mid-June and ended in mid-July, over a time span of 35 days. All experimental plants were watered to saturation before the experiment. During the treatment, half of the plants were served as the control group, they were watered once or twice a day. The remaining plants were subjected to drought-stress treatment. Every morning, a soil moisture probe (ECH2 O Check, Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA) was inserted to a 5 cm depth into each pot to record the volumetric water content percentage, i. e., the amount of total soil volume consisting of water. Control plants were watered to maintain field capacity, i. e., soil moisture readings at 35%. For plants in the drought treatment, sufficient water was added to keep the soil moisture readings between 5% and 10%. The results showed that endophyte infection had no significant effect on the host's vegetative growth, total biomass, chlorophyll content. On the other hand, it has a favorable effect on the host's maintenance of photochemical efficiency (Fv/ Fm), and made a contribution to keep the stability of photosystem II. Endophyte infection had no significant effect on Fv/ Fm in the control treatment, but enhanced the Fv/Fm of the host plant significantly under drought stress. At the same time, endophyte infection alleviated the drought injury on the cell membrane of the host grass, i. e. endophyte infection reduced the production of malondialdehyde (MDA). Endophyte infection did not improve the activity of protective enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), while the carotenoid content of the EI plants was significantly higher than that of the EF plants under drought stress. Therefore, we suggested that under drought stress, endophyte infection may alleviate the adverse effect mainly through non-enzyme systems instead of protective enzymes. Others studies have showed that the endophyte promotes host natural grass tolerance of drought mainly by two mechanisms: (1) by changing the morphological and physiological characteristic of the host plants to help them maintain a reasonable growth rate under drought stress; (2) the endophyte enables plant tissues to withstand water deficits, but as a trade-off, the endophyte reduces the host plant's growth. In our study, the endophyte infection did not have a significant effect on the host plant's vegetative growth and biomass accumulation under drought stress, but did remit the drought damage to some extent. We suggest that endophyte may enable plants invest more in structural carbohydrates such as lignin and fiber to help host plant overcome the resource-limited environment. Thus, it will be interesting to determine whether endophyte infection contributes to greater investment in structural carbohydrates in plants.",Han R.; Li X.; Ren A.; Gao Y.,Shengtai Xuebao/ Acta Ecologica Sinica,2011,NA,0.687038283089385,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.894379999344718,0.105620000655282,0.999999760654622,2.39345377739397e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
3200,"Distinct Microbial Community of Phyllosphere Associated with Five Tropical Plants on Yongxing Island, South China Sea","The surfaces of a leaf are unique and wide habitats for a microbial community. These microorganisms play a key role in plant growth and adaptation to adverse conditions, such as producing growth factors to promote plant growth and inhibiting pathogens to protect host plants. The composition of microbial communities very greatly amongst different plant species, yet there is little data on the composition of the microbiome of the host plants on the coral island in the South China Sea. In this study, we investigated the abundances and members of a major microbial community (fungi, bacteria, and diazotrophs) on the leaves of five dominant plant species (Ipomoea pes-caprae, Wedelia chinensis, Scaevola sericea, Cocos nucifera, and Sesuvium portulacastrum) on the island using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and high-throughput amplicon sequencing. Quantitative PCR results showed that fungi and bacteria were ubiquitous and variable among different host plants. Scaevola sericea showed the lowest absolute abundance and highest diversity of fungi and bacteria, while Cocos nucifera had the lowest abundance and the highest diversity of diazotrophs compare to the other four plants. There was a small proportion of shared microorganisms among the five different plants, while unique fungi, bacteria and diazotrophs were significantly enriched for different host plant species in this study (p < 0.05). Some of the most abundant organisms found in the communities of these different host plants are involved in important biogeochemical cycles that can benefit their host, including carbon and nitrogen cycles.","Bao, LJ; Cai, WY; Zhang, XF; Liu, JH; Chen, H; Wei, YS; Jia, XX; Bai, ZH",MICROORGANISMS,2019,10.3390/microorganisms7110525,0.965491772496247,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999099459835143,9.0054016485715e-4,0.99999998874178,1.12582199118805e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11224,"trans-2-Octenal controls Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, the causal agent of tomato wilt in vitro, in soil and in the field","BACKGROUNDFungal plant diseases cause major crop losses. Phytopathogenic fungi's ability to evolve resistance to fungicides, alongside ongoing prohibition of such agents by the European Commission because of their pronounced adverse effects on human health and the environment, make their control a challenge. Moreover, the development of less perilous fungicides is a complex task. Here we describe the process and challenges involved in the development of a novel fungicide, from in-vitro studies to field experiments.RESULTSIn-vitro experiments with trans-2-octenal, a bioactive compound secreted by the endophytic fungus Daldinia cf. concentrica, revealed its ability to fully inhibit and kill phytopathogenic microorganisms. A formulated version of trans-2-octenal was then used against the soil-borne pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Forl), the causal agent of tomato vascular wilt disease, in pot experiments with different soil types. We found the highest fungicidal activity in sandy and loam soils, whereas heavy soil impaired activity. Lastly, we investigated the activity of the formulated trans-2-octenal against Forl in semi-field experiments. We achieved complete elimination of Forl, provided the soil is rotavated after trans-2-octenal application.CONCLUSIONtrans-2-Octenal has the potential to control Forl in vitro, in pots and in the field.

17702,"Plant growth-promoting bacterial endophytes as biocontrol agents of pre- and post-harvest diseases: Fundamentals, methods of application and future perspectives.","Sustainable agriculture requires the recruitment of bacterial agents to control diverse plant diseases such as bacterial endophytes. Bacterial endophytes colonize and inhabit internal plant tissues without causing any apparent damage. Within the plant, these bacteria exert multiple beneficiary effects, including direct stimulation of plant growth by the action of phytohormones or the production of metabolites. However, bacterial endophytes also protect their plant host through biocontrol pathogens or by inducing plant innate immune system. The present work makes a systematic and in-depth review on the current state of endophytic bacterial diversity, their plant colonization strategies, and their potential roles as protective agents against plant diseases during pre- and post-harvest stages of crop productivity. In addition, an exploration of their beneficial effects on sustainable agriculture by reducing/eliminating the use of toxic agrochemicals was conducted.

METHODS: SMEFGB were cultured. The secondary metabolites of endophytic fungi was extracted, purified and identified. The effects of secondary metabolites on proliferation, apoptosis and migration of human cervical cancer HeLa cells were determined. In addition, the effects of SMEFGB on growth of Hela implanted tumor in mice were investigated. RESULTS: In 9 stains of endophytic fungi successfully isolated from the leaves of Ginkgo biloba, the stain J-1, J-2 and J-3 could produce podophyllotoxin. These 3 stains were identified by molecular biology. The secondary metabolites of stain J-1, J-2 and J-3 markedly inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells, promoted their apoptosis and blocked their migration. In addition, the secondary metabolites of stain J-1, J-2 and J-3 significantly attenuated the growth of HeLa implanted tumor in mice.

We report on the isolation of seed-borne fungal endophytes from Phragmites australis (common reed) that were ascribed to the genus Stagonospora. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays revealed that a Stagonospora sp. regularly colonized reed as shown for a period of three years. In spring, it was only detected in roots, whereas in autumn, it could frequently be found in all organs, including seeds. Microcosm experiments revealed that seeds harbored viable propagules of the fungus that colonized the developing germling, indicating vertical transmission. Endophytic growth was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy, reisolation of the fungus after surface sterilization, and PCR. Aseptic microcosms were established for studying fungal contributions towards host vitality. Several Stagonospora isolates enhanced reed biomass. Seed-borne endophytic Stagonospora spp. thus can provide improved vigor to common reed, which could be most important when seed-derived germlings establish new reed stands.","Ernst, M; Mendgen, KW; Wirsel, SGR",MOLECULAR PLANT-MICROBE INTERACTIONS,2003,10.1094/MPMI.2003.16.7.580,0.991830401714448,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999999999984983,1.50166488614369e-11,1,0,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

16949,Curvularia Blight on Lolium perenne on Turfgrasses in Argentina.,"Lolium perenne L. is commonly used alone or in association with blue-grass and fescues in sport fields, parks, and gardens. During 2003, symptoms of an unknown disease were observed on L. perenne turfgrass in western Buenos Aires. Initial symptoms were indefinite yellow and green dappled spots that extended downward from the leaf tip, turned brown and finally gray, causing leaf death. Segments of symptomatic leaf tissues were surface sterilized and placed on 2% potato dextrose agar in petri dishes. After 4 days at room temperature, blackish brown colonies developed with dark brown septate conidiophores. Conidia were 21 to 29 × 9 to 13 μm, 3-septa, curved at the third cell from the base that is longer and darker than the others. Cells at each end are subhyaline and intermediate cells are medium brown. These characteristics are consistent with Curvularia lunata (Wakker) Boedijng (1). Pathogenicity tests were performed in five plastic trays with substrate of natural soil and sand (1:1 [v/v]) where the turfgrass (L. perenne cv. El Cencerro) was seeded. Plants were inoculated by spraying a suspension of 2 × 106 conidia per ml of sterile distilled water. Controls were sprayed with sterile distilled water. The trays were covered with transparent plastic bags, sprayed periodically with water, and incubated at 25°C in a greenhouse for 20 days. The first symptoms were observed 3 days later. After 9 days, 24% of the grass surface area showed blight lesions. C. lunata was consistently reisolated from affected tissues. Control plants remained symptomless.

363,Endophytic fungi from Vitis labrusca L. ('Niagara Rosada') and its potential for the biological control of Fusarium oxysporum,"We investigated the diversity of endophytic fungi found on grape (Vitis labrusca cv. Niagara Rosada) leaves collected from Salesopolis, SP, Brazil. The fungi were isolated and characterized by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis, followed by sequencing of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA. In addition, the ability of these endophytic fungi to inhibit the grapevine pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp herbemontis was determined in vitro. We also observed that the climatic factors, such as temperature and rainfall, have no effect on the frequency of infection by endophytic fungi. The endophytic fungal community that was identified included Aporospora terricola, Aureobasidium pullulans, Bjerkandera adusta, Colletotrichum boninense, C. gloeosporioides, Diaporthe helianthi, D. phaseolorum, Epicoccum nigrum, Flavodon flavus, Fusarium subglutinans, F. sacchari, Guignardia mangiferae, Lenzites elegans, Paraphaeosphaeria pilleata, Phanerochaete sordida, Phyllosticta sp, Pleurotus nebrodensis, Preussia africana, Tinctoporellus epiniltinus, and Xylaria berteri. Among these isolates, two, C. gloeosporioides and F. flavus, showed potential antagonistic activity against F. oxysporum f. sp herbemontis. We suggest the involvement of the fungal endophyte community of V. labrusca in protecting the host plant against pathogenic Fusarium species. Possibly, some endophytic isolates could be selected for the development of biological control agents for grape fungal disease; alternatively, management strategies could be tailored to increase these beneficial fungi.","Brum, MCP; Araújo, WL; Maki, CS; Azevedo, JL",GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH,2012,10.4238/2012.December.6.2,0.864077037679175,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999949552491189,5.04475088111071e-5,1,0,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Here, we investigated a panel of 137 bacterial isolates present in different organs of the medicinal plant Echinacea purpurea, aiming to evaluate if different plant organs harbor strains with different antibiotic resistance profiles, implying then the presence of different biological interactions in the communities inhabiting different plant organs. Data obtained showed a large antibiotic resistance variability among strains, which was strongly related to the different plant organs (26% of total variance, P < 0.0001). Interestingly this uneven antibiotic resistance pattern was present also when a single genus (Pseudomonas), ubiquitous in all organs, was analyzed and no correlation of antibiotic resistance pattern with genomic relatedness among strains was found.

Here, we report the identification of additional non-Acremonium sp. endophytes (herein designated p-endophytes) in three more grass species: Festuca gigantea, Festuca arizonica, and Festuca pratensis. In each grass species, the p-endophyte was cosymbiotic with an Acremonium endophyte. Serological analysis and sequence determinations of variable portions of their rRNA genes indicated that the two previously identified non-Acremonium endophytes are closely related to each other and to the newly identified p-endophytes.

19652,Selection of Endophytic Strains for Enhanced Bacteria-Assisted Phytoremediation of Organic Pollutants Posing a Public Health Hazard.,"Anthropogenic activities generate a high quantity of organic pollutants, which have an impact on human health and cause adverse environmental effects. Monitoring of many hazardous contaminations is subject to legal regulations, but some substances such as therapeutic agents, personal care products, hormones, and derivatives of common organic compounds are currently not included in these regulations. Classical methods of removal of organic pollutants involve economically challenging processes. In this regard, remediation with biological agents can be an alternative. For in situ decontamination, the plant-based approach called phytoremediation can be used. However, the main disadvantages of this method are the limited accumulation capacity of plants, sensitivity to the action of high concentrations of hazardous pollutants, and no possibility of using pollutants for growth. To overcome these drawbacks and additionally increase the efficiency of the process, an integrated technology of bacteria-assisted phytoremediation is being used recently. For the system to work, it is necessary to properly select partners, especially endophytes for specific plants, based on the knowledge of their metabolic abilities and plant colonization capacity. The best approach that allows broad recognition of all relationships occurring in a complex community of endophytic bacteria and its variability under the influence of various factors can be obtained using culture-independent techniques. However, for practical application, culture-based techniques have priority.",Karaś MA; Wdowiak-Wróbel S; Sokołowski W,International journal of molecular sciences,2021,10.3390/ijms22179557,0.979251450948424,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.660746737208231,0.339253262791769,0.999952792324001,4.72076759994167e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
2439,Exemplifying endophytes of banana (Musa paradisiaca) for their potential role in growth stimulation and management of Fusarium oxysporumf. spcubense causing panama wilt,"In the present study, potentiality of endophytic microorganisms such as Rigidiporus vinctus AAU EF, Trichoderma reesei UH EF, and Sphingobacterium tabacisoli UH EB in the management of panama wilt and growth promotion of banana was assessed through artificial inoculation. During the study, a total of 220 bacterial and 110 fungal endophytes were isolated from root, pseudostem, and leaf samples of banana, and they were evaluated against Fusarium oxysporumf. spcubense causing panama wilt. Out of total 330 bacterial and fungal endophytes, only five endophytes exhibited antagonism against Fusarium oxysporumf. spcubense, out of which only three isolates, namely Trichoderma reesei UH EF, Rigidiporus vinctus AAU EF, and Sphingobacterium tabacisoli UH EB, produced indole acetic acid, siderophore, and hydrogen cyanide, except one bacterial strain Sphingobacterium tabacisoli UH EB which does not produce hydrogen cyanide. Furthermore, these three endophytes were identified through cultural and morphological characteristics as well as by the sequencing internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 16S rRNA gene sequences analysis for bacteria, respectively. The response of host plant to endophyte inoculation was assessed by measuring the change in four growth parameters; plant height, pseudo stem girth (diameter), number of roots, and total number of leaves. The application of endophytes, irrespective of isolate and treatment type promoted the overall growth of the plant growth when compared with diseased plants with significant higher values recorded for all parameters assessed. The endophytes reported as growth promoters were found to have significant inhibition effect on Foc which can evidenced with lowest AUDPC values and epidemic rate at 99.09 units(2) and 0.02 unit/day, respectively.","Savani, AK; Bhattacharyya, A; Boro, RC; Dinesh, K; Swamy, JCN",FOLIA MICROBIOLOGICA,2021,10.1007/s12223-021-00853-5,0.994177689975192,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992901954102028,0.00709804589797234,0.999999999992109,7.89135423673315e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
14878,Large-scale fungal diversity assessment in the Andean Yungas forests reveals strong community turnover among forest types along an altitudinal gradient,"The Yungas, a system of tropical and subtropical montane forests on the eastern slopes of the Andes, are extremely diverse and severely threatened by anthropogenic pressure and climate change. Previous mycological works focused on macrofungi (e.g. agarics, polypores) and mycorrhizae in Alnus acuminata forests, while fungal diversity in other parts of the Yungas has remained mostly unexplored. We carried out Ion Torrent sequencing of ITS2 rDNA from soil samples taken at 24 sites along the entire latitudinal extent of the Yungas in Argentina. The sampled sites represent the three altitudinal forest types: the piedmont (400-700 m a.s.l.), montane (700-1500 m a.s.l.) and montane cloud (1500-3000 m a.s.l.) forests. The deep sequence data presented here (i.e. 4 108 126 quality-filtered sequences) indicate that fungal community composition correlates most strongly with elevation, with many fungi showing preference for a certain altitudinal forest type. For example, ectomycorrhizal and root endophytic fungi were most diverse in the montane cloud forests, particularly at sites dominated by Alnus acuminata, while the diversity values of various saprobic groups were highest at lower elevations. Despite the strong altitudinal community turnover, fungal diversity was comparable across the different zonal forest types. Besides elevation, soil pH, N, P, and organic matter contents correlated with fungal community structure as well, although most of these variables were co-correlated with elevation. Our data provide an unprecedented insight into the high diversity and spatial distribution of fungi in the Yungas forests. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Geml J.; Pastor N.; Fernandez L.; Pacheco S.; Semenova T.A.; Becerra A.G.; Wicaksono C.Y.; Nouhra E.R.,Molecular Ecology,2014,10.1111/mec.12765,0.824373711526723,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.953707371308445,0.0462926286915549,0.999999342816945,6.57183054753041e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
13679,Effects of O3 on alder photosynthesis and symbiosis with Frankia,"Alnus serrulata (Aiton) Willdenow seedlings with and without root nodules formed by the nitrogen‐fixing actinomycete Frankia were exposed to clean filtered air or ozone (O3) at 0.12 μl l−1 for 27 d (approximately 164 h total exposure). Gas exchange measurements on leaves and transmission electron micrographs of root nodule cells were made to detect any O3 effects on the functioning of leaves and the root symbiont. Photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and internal CO2, concentration were calculated for all plants in clean O3‐free air more than three weeks after the fumigations began. Significant positive correlations between photosynthesis and conductance were found for leaves of control nodulated and unnodulated alders and O3‐treated nodulated alders. There was a weak positive correlation between photosynthesis and conductance for unnodulated O3‐treated seedlings measured in clean air. When O3‐treated leaves were measured during fumigation with O3, no positive correlation between photosynthesis and conductance was found for either nodulated or unnodulated seedlings. Photosynthetic rates of leaves having the highest stomatal conductance values were decreased by O3for both nodulated and unnodulated plants. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that after a 27 d exposure of shoots to O3, host root cells of nodules from O3‐treated plants lacked organelles and showed extensive cytoplasmic breakdown. Hyphae and N2‐fixing vesicles of Frankia appeared normal. The Frankia endophyte seems to be more resistant to O3 than is the host root nodule cell. These results show that ambient levels of O3 may reduce photosynthesis and bring about associated degradation in rhizosphere symbiosis. Copyright © 1989, Wiley Blackwell.

1798,Microbial community response to growing season and plant nutrient optimisation in a boreal Norway spruce forest,"Interactions between Norway spruce trees and bacteria and fungi in nutrient limited boreal forests can be beneficial for tree growth and fitness. Tree-level effects of anthropogenic nutrient addition have been well studied, however understanding of the long-term effects on the associated microbiota is limited. Here, we report on the sensitivity of microbial community composition to the growing season and nutrient additions. High throughput sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS1 region was used to characterise changes in the microbial community after application of a complete mineral nutrient mixture for five and 25 years. The experiment was conducted using the Flakaliden forest research site in northern boreal Sweden and included naturally low nutrient control plots. Needle and fine root samples of Norway spruce were sampled in addition to bulk soil during one growing season to provide comprehensive insight into phyllosphere and belowground microbiota community changes. The phyllosphere microbiota was compositionally distinct from the below ground communities and phyllosphere diversity increased significantly over the growing season but was not influenced by the improved nutrient status of the trees. In both root and soil samples, alpha diversity of fungal, in particular ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), and bacterial communities increased after long-term nutrient optimisation, and with increasing years of treatment the composition of the fungal and bacterial communities changed toward a community with a higher relative abundance of nitrophilic EMF and bacterial species but did not cause complete loss of nitrophobic species from the ecosystem. From this, we conclude that 25 years of continuous nutrient addition to a boreal spruce stand increased phylotype richness and diversity of the microbiota in the soil, and at the root-soil interface, suggesting that long-term anthropogenic nutrient inputs can have positive effects on belowground biodiversity that may enhance ecosystem robustness. Future studies are needed to assess the impact of these changes to the microbiota on ecosystem carbon storage and nitrogen cycling in boreal forests.","Haas, JC; Street, NR; Sjödin, A; Lee, NM; Högberg, MN; Näsholm, T; Hurry, V",SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,2018,10.1016/j.soilbio.2018.07.005,0.669329584878859,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999999917631519,8.2368480618104e-8,0.999999999999723,2.77222689248902e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

Okra polysaccharide has the repeating structure (1 -> 4)-O-alpha-(D-galactopyranosyluronic acid) (1 -> 2)-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranose in its hexasaccharide repeating unit of its main chain. To determine the enzymes essential for Lp production, the supernatant of a culture broth was fractionated by repeated column chromatographies to identify two serial fractions responsible for Lp production and non-Lp production by measuring Lp production together with P-galactosidase (P-gal), rhamnogalacturonan lyase (RG-lyase) and acetylesterase (AE) activities, which we hypothesized to be necessary for Lp production from the structure of Lp. We confirmed the presence of these three enzymatic activities in the highest-Lp-producing fraction. The addition of purified RG-lyase to fractions producing no or a small amount of Lp demonstrated that P-gal and RG-lyase activities are necessary for Lp production. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the three separated proteins on SDS-PAGE confirmed the presence of enzymes identical to P-gal, RG-lyase and AE in the Lp-producing fractions.","Saranpuetti, C; Tanaka, M; Sone, T; Asano, K; Tomita, F",JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCE AND BIOENGINEERING,2006,10.1263/jbb.102.452,0.986049207040796,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99852926384248,0.00147073615751972,0.999999997172176,2.82782408600468e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

7663,Endophytic fungi from the Amazonian plant Paullinia cupana and from Olea europaea isolated using cassava as an alternative starch media source,"Endophytic fungi live inside plants, apparently do not cause any harm to their hosts and may play important roles in defense and growth promotion. Fungal growth is a routine practice at microbiological laboratories, and the Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) is the most frequently used medium because it is a rich source of starch. However, the production of potatoes in some regions of the world can be costly. Aiming the development of a new medium source to tropical countries, in the present study, we used leaves from the guarana (a tropical plant from the Amazon region) and the olive (which grows in subtropical and temperate regions) to isolate endophytic fungi using PDA and Manihot Dextrose Agar (MDA). Cassava (Manihot esculenta) was evaluated as a substitute starch source. For guarana, the endophytic incidence (EI) was 90% and 98% on PDA and MDA media, respectively, and 65% and 70% for olive, respectively. The fungal isolates were sequenced using the ITS-rDNA region. The fungal identification demonstrated that the isolates varied according to the host plant and media source. In the guarana plant, 13 fungal genera were found using MDA and six were found using PDA. In the olive plant, six genera were obtained using PDA and 4 were obtained using MDA. The multivariate analysis results demonstrated the highest fungal diversity from guarana when using MDA medium. Interestingly, some genera were isolated from one specific host or in one specific media, suggesting the importance of these two factors in fungal isolation specificity. Thus, this study indicated that cassava is a feasible starch source that could serve as a potential alternative medium to potato medium.","Sia, ED; Marcon, J; Luvizotto, DM; Quecine, MC; Tsui, S; Pereira, JO; Pizzirani-Kleiner, AA; Azevedo, JL",SPRINGERPLUS,2013,10.1186/2193-1801-2-579,0.98741632510145,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994977249599375,0.00502275040062473,0.999999962867251,3.7132749430846e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Strains of Fusarium moniliforme isolated from cereals in Europe produced in cultures high levels (up to 4 mg/g) of fumonisins B1 and B2 (FB1 and FB2). FB1 and FB2 have been found in maize and maize‐based foods and feeds in most European countries. In Italy these mycotoxins have been directly involved in a fatal outbreak of equine leukoencephalomalacia, and have been found at different levels in most maize‐based food products, including polenta—a staple food in a region with high incidence of esophageal cancer. The European Commission, Community Bureau of Reference (BCR) and Measurements and Testing Programme (M&T), has undertaken two consecutive intercomparison studies, involving over 20 laboratories from 12 European countries, to improve the quality of fumonisins analysis at European level. The first study consisted in the evaluation of the determination of fumonisins in an unknown solution, while the second one involved the analytical methodology for fumonisins in contaminated and blank maize samples.

8262,The growth of tomato seedlings inoculated with co-cultivated Piriformospora indica and Bacillus pumilus,"A novel co-culture method using the beneficial root endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica and a plant-growth promoting rhizobacterial strain of Bacillus pumilus to promote the growth of tomato seedlings in plug trays, is described. Coconut water, a waste product from the coconut industry, was used as medium for co-cultivation of the two biological agents. During the co-culture with the fungus, the bacterial strain showed a similar growth rate to that in monoculture in fresh autoclaved coconut water. In contrast, co-culture in potato dextrose broth (PDB), a medium routinely used for cultivation of the endophytic fungus, did not support bacterial growth. Inoculation with the co-culture or a mixture of P. indica and B. pumilus promoted tomato seedling growth significantly when compared with individual application of the two biological agents. No difference was observed with respect to the degree of root colonization in tomato seedlings whether it was done with a monoculture or a co-culture with rhizobacterium. The co-culture system developed reduces the cost of inoculum production as it uses coconut water, a cheap and locally available waste product and a single fermentation vessel.

17952,Comparison of specific endophytic bacterial communities in different developmental stages of Passiflora incarnata using culture-dependent and culture-independent analysis.,"Plants and endophytic microorganisms have coevolved unique relationships over many generations. Plants show a specific physiological status in each developmental stage, which may determine the occurrence and dominance of specific endophytic populations with a predetermined ecological role. This study aimed to compare and determine the structure and composition of cultivable and uncultivable bacterial endophytic communities in vegetative and reproductive stages (RS) of Passiflora incarnata. To that end, the endophytic communities were assessed by plating and Illumina-based 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Two hundred and four cultivable bacterial strains were successfully isolated. From the plant's RS, the isolated strains were identified mainly as belonging to the genera Sphingomonas, Curtobacterium, and Methylobacterium, whereas Bacillus was the dominant genus isolated from the vegetative stage (VS). From a total of 133,399 sequences obtained from Illumina-based sequencing, a subset of 25,092 was classified in operational taxonomy units (OTUs). Four hundred and sixteen OTUs were obtained from the VS and 66 from the RS. In the VS, the most abundant families were Pseudoalteromonadaceae and Alicyclobacillaceae, while in the RS, Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillaceae were the most abundant families. The exclusive abundance of specific bacterial populations for each developmental stage suggests that plants may modulate bacterial endophytic community structure in response to different physiological statuses occurring at the different plant developmental stages.",Goulart MC; Cueva-Yesquén LG; Hidalgo Martinez KJ; Attili-Angelis D; Fantinatti-Garboggini F,MicrobiologyOpen,2019,10.1002/mbo3.896,0.942895100881321,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.955548091878914,0.0444519081210865,0.999999953729336,4.62706638559851e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

10693,Mycoflora of Iranian maize harvested in the main production areas in 2000,"Maize is one of the most important cereals produced in, and imported into, Iran. The incidences of seed-borne fungi were determined in Iranian maize harvested in 2000 from four major production areas with different climatic conditions, namely Fars, Khuzestan, Kermanshah and Mazandaran provinces. This is the first study to compare the mycoflora of maize in the aforementioned areas. Mycological analyses showed a predominance of Fusarium species (38.5%), followed by Aspergillus species (8.7%), Rhizopus species (4.8%), Penicillium species (4.5%), Mucor species (1.1%), and four other fungal genera. Fusarium verticillioides was the most prevalent species (83% of Fusarium isolates and 52% of the total isolations), with the highest incidence in Mazandaran (59%), a region of Iran with the highest rainfall and relative humidity, high rate of esophageal cancer (EC) and high levels of fumonisins in maize. Aspergillus flavus was the most widely recovered Aspergillus species and 38% of samples were contaminated with this potentially aflatoxigenic fungus. The incidence of A. flavus was highest in Kermanshah, the province with lowest mean minimum temperature. Penicillium species were seen in all the samples and Fars had the highest incidence, with highly significant differences when compared to the other three provinces. Diplodia species were not isolated from any of the samples examined.","Ghiasian, SA; Kord-Bacheh, P; Rezayat, SM; Maghsood, AH; Taherkhani, H",MYCOPATHOLOGIA,2004,10.1023/B:MYCO.0000038425.95049.03,0.952626202553219,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997046249594361,0.00295375040563929,0.999999931320423,6.86795771365212e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1381,Untargeted metabolomics screening reveals unique secondary metabolite production from Alternaria section Alternaria,"Alternaria section Alternaria is comprised of many species that infect a broad diversity of important crop plants and cause post-harvest spoilage. Alternaria section Alternaria species, such as A. alternata and A. arborescens, are prolific producers of secondary metabolites that act as virulence factors of disease and are mycotoxins that accumulate in infected tissues-metabolites that can vary in their spectrum of production between individuals from the same fungal species. Untargeted metabolomics profiling of secondary metabolite production using mass spectrometry is an effective means to detect phenotypic anomalies in secondary metabolism within a species. Secondary metabolite phenotypes from 36 Alternaria section Alternaria isolates were constructed to observe frequency of production patterns. A clear and unique mass feature pattern was observed for three of the strains that were linked with the production of the dehydrocurvularin family of toxins and associated detoxification products. Examination of corresponding genomes revealed the presence of the dehydrocurvularin biosynthesis gene cluster associated with a sub-telomeric accessory region. A comparison of sequence similarity and occurrences of the dehydrocurvularin biosynthetic gene cluster within Pleosporalean fungi is presented and discussed.","Witte, TE; Villenueve, N; Shields, SW; Sproule, A; Eggertson, Q; Kim, NE; Boddy, CN; Dettman, JR; Overy, DP",FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES,2022,10.3389/fmolb.2022.1038299,0.873901840694632,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.962578253937523,0.0374217460624773,0.999999997582778,2.4172219781348804e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
20553,Occurrence of storage fungi in jatropha (Jatropha curcas L.) seeds,"Atropha is a potential source for production of bio-diesel and an alternative source for fossil fuels. The present study is undertaken for the analysis of storage fungi and its biodiversity in Jatropha seed samples collected from local market and research institutes in Chennai. Standard plating technique was used to study the growth of storage fungi in seeds stored for 12 to 60 months by using selective media called osmophilic media. The analysis of storage fungi in seeds with different treatments to observe as (1) surface mycoflora (2) surface invaders (3) internal fungi (4) kernel fungi. The results show that, the occurrence of different species of Aspergillus, Penicillium and Mucor species was the dominant mycoflora even from interior portion of the seeds. Among the species of storage fungi encountered, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus glaucus, Aspergillus fumigatus and Penicillium species were frequently present in the order of dominance. Mucor and Rhizhopus also occur constantly in all the samples. The higher contamination of seeds with storage fungi indicates the possibility of quality losses particularly in lipid, which may affect the quality of bio-diesel. Among the different strains of A. flavus, few were found to produce aflatoxin B1. The spoilage of lipids by the named fungi, may affect the quality of bio-diesel. This study will create awareness of fungal spoilage on biodiesel seeds and for remedy to prevent the storage losses by microorganisms.","Jayaraman, P; NesaPriya, S; Parameshwari, S; Priya, SS; Jawahar, N; Babu, HS",AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY RESEARCH,2011,NA,0.908764428975133,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.905848545381475,0.0941514546185247,0.999993253827911,6.74617208928918e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19042,Screening of bacterial endophytes of larch against Neofusicoccum laricinum and validation of their safety.,"In order to provide a highly feasible research pathway for the control of larch shoot blight, healthy larch branches and leaves were collected from 13 sampling sites in 8 provinces in China. The antagonistic endophytic bacteria obtained from the screening were used to carry out disease control experiments in potted seedlings. The safety evaluation test was conducted on the antagonistic bacteria. Subsequently, the strains with better preventive effect and high safety were identified by morphological and molecular methods. A total of 391 strains of endophytic bacteria were isolated from healthy larch branches and leaves. Seventy-eight strains of larch endophytic bacteria with antagonistic effect were obtained by primary sieving. Ten strains of endophytic bacteria with obvious antagonism were further obtained by secondary sieving, and all of them had an inhibition rate of more than 57%. Among them, strains YN 2, JL 6, NMG 23, and JL 54 showed the highest inhibition rate of 63.16%-65.08%, which was significantly different from the other treatments. The results of the pot test showed that 14 days after inoculation with the pathogen, strains YN 2 and JL 54 were more effective in the control of larch shoot blight, with the preventive effects reaching 57.7% and 50.0%, respectively. Strains JL 6 and JL 54 were biologically safe in the safety evaluation test. Therefore, strain JL 54 was selected for identification. It was identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens through morphological observation, 16S rDNA sequence, gyrB gene sequence and 16S rDNA-gyrB tandem feature sequence analysis. Larch shoot blight is a widely distributed, damaging, and rapidly spreading fungal disease of forest trees that poses a serious threat to larch plantations. Endophytic bacteria have biological effects on host plants against pests and diseases, and they have a growth-promoting effect on plants. In this paper, we investigated for the first time the biocontrol effect of endophytic bacteria on larch shoot blight by screening endophytic bacteria with the function of antagonizing dieback fungi.

7278,"A mutualistic symbiosis between a dark septate endophytic fungus, Heteroconium chaetospira, and a nonmycorrhizal plant, Chinese cabbage","Symbiotic microorganisms, such as mycorrhizal fungi, are known to associate with most plants; however members of the Cruciferae are an exception. We investigated nutrient exchange between a dark septate endophytic fungus, Heteroconium chaelospira, and Chinese cabbage plants (Cruciferae) in vitro. Chinese cabbage could not use some amino acids, while the fungus-treated plants were able to use all of the nitrogen forms provided. To demonstrate that nitrogen transfer occurs between the fungus and the host plant, we used a hydrophobic polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane compartment system, which restricts diffusion and mass flow of ions and allows only fungal penetration. Our results strongly suggest that H. chaetospira provided nitrogen to the plant, rather than the plant mineralizing available organic nitrogen. In addition carbon transfer from the host plant to the fungus was demonstrated with HPLC and (CO2)-C-13-labeling experiments. When H. chaetospira colonized host plant roots under low glucose condition, ergosterol content in culture pot (as an index of fungal biomass) increased significantly compared to the fungal treatment without a host plant. Sucrose concentration in the host root significantly decreased as a result of fungal colonization, and mannitol (a specific carbon source to fungal cells) increased in the roots. Sucrose and mannitol in the host root treated with the fungus were labeled clearly by C-13 after C-13-labeled CO2 was provided to the plant. These results suggest that the fungus obtained carbon, mainly as sucrose, from the host plant. We show for the first time the existence of a fungus establishing a mutualistic association with a nontnycorrhizal Cruciferae plant.","Usuki, F; Narisawa, H",MYCOLOGIA,2007,10.3852/mycologia.99.2.175,0.772778207317481,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994421364730506,0.00557863526949431,0.999999925316885,7.46831151365868e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

17434,Genetics of Cordyceps and related fungi.,"Ascomycete Cordyceps sensu lato consists of hundreds of species of fungi capable of infecting different insects. Species of these fungi are either valued traditional Chinese medicines or used for biocontrol of insect pests. Phylogenomic analysis indicated that fungal entomopathogenicity has evolved for multiple times, and the species of Cordyceps were diverged from the mycoparasite or plant endophyte. Relative to plant pathogens and saprophytes, Cordyceps species demonstrate characteristic genome expansions of proteases and chitinases that are used by the fungi to target insect cuticles. Only a single mating-type gene identified in the sequenced species of Cordyceps sensu lato indicates that these fungi are sexually heterothallic, but the gene structure of the mating-type loci and frequency in performing sexual cycle are considerably different between different species. Similar to the model fungus Neurospora crassa, Cordyceps and related fungi contain the full components for RNA interference pathways. However, the mechanism of repeat-induced point mutation varies between different fungi. Epigenetic rather than genetic alterations are majorly responsible for the frequent occurrence of culture degeneration in Cordyceps-related species.

Carex kobomugi Ohwi in coastal sand dunes was treated with the supernatant solution of Penicillium citrinum KACC43900 isolated from Ixeris repens (L.) A. Gray. After treatment, the length of leaf blades, photosynthesis, chlorophyll fluorescence, and soil respiration were measured in the field. The contents of chlorophyll and carotenoid were determined with leaf blades selected for measurement of chlorophyll fluorescence. Fungal culture filtrate (FCF) increased leaf blade length, the contents of chlorophyll a (Chl a) and chlorophyll b (Chl b), total chlorophyll (total Chl [a + b]), and carotenoid in leaf blades of C. kobomugi. FCF also increased net photosynthetic rate (A), transpiration rate (E), carboxylation efficiency (A/Ci), and water-use efficiency (A/E). However, the ratio of variable fluorescence to maximal fluorescence (Fv/Fm) did not show significant difference between control and FCF-treated plants. Soil respiration rates were higher in the site treated with FCF than the control. Although growth response and physiological characteristics of C. kobomugi were different according to the treatment methods of FCF, injection or spray treatment, plant growth of C. kobomugi was increased with FCF treatment.","Hwang, JS; You, YH; Bae, JJ; Khan, SA; Kim, JG; Choo, YS",JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH,2011,10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-10-00090.1,0.96742871214293,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995552086256189,0.00444791374381146,0.99999999402763,5.972369931939171e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
14510,Multi-marker metabarcoding of coral skeletons reveals a rich microbiome and diverse evolutionary origins of endolithic algae,"Bacteria, fungi and green algae are common inhabitants of coral skeletons. Their diversity is poorly characterized because they are difficult to identify with microscopy or environmental sequencing, as common metabarcoding markers have low phylogenetic resolution and miss a large portion of the biodiversity. We used a cost-effective protocol and a combination of markers (tufA, 16S rDNA, 18S rDNA and 23S rDNA) to characterize the microbiome of 132 coral skeleton samples. We identified a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, many never reported in corals before. We additionally investigated the phylogenetic diversity of the green algae - the most abundant eukaryotic member of this community, for which previous literature recognizes only a handful of endolithic species. We found more than 120 taxonomic units (near species level), including six family-level lineages mostly new to science. The results suggest that the existence of lineages with an endolithic lifestyle predates the existence of modern scleractinian corals by ca. 250my, and that this particular niche was independently invaded by over 20 lineages in green algae evolution. These results highlight the potential of the multi-marker approach to assist in species discovery and, when combined with a phylogenetic framework, clarify the evolutionary origins of host-microbiota associations. © The Author(s) 2016.",Marcelino V.R.; Verbruggen H.,Scientific Reports,2016,10.1038/srep31508,0.874207366914376,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.946988900588646,0.0530110994113537,0.99999973578079,2.64219210177608e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1528,From Endophyte Community Analysis to Field Application: Control of Apple Canker (Neonectria ditissima) with Epicoccum nigrum B14-1,"Apple canker, caused by Neonectria ditissima (Tul. and C. Tul.) Samuels and Rossman, is a major disease of apples (Malus domestica) worldwide. N. ditissima infects through natural and artificial wounds. Infected wood develops canker lesions which girdle branches and main stems causing reduced yield and tree death. N. ditissima is difficult to control; removal of inoculum (cankers) is expensive and therefore seldom practiced, whilst effective chemical products are being banned and no biocontrol products have been found to be effective against N. ditissima. This study used cues from a previous apple endophyte community analysis to isolate and test fungal endophytes belonging to the genus Epicoccum as potential endophytic biocontrol agents. Epicoccum nigrum B14-1, isolated from healthy apple trees, antagonised N. ditissima in vitro and reduced the incidence of N. ditissima infections of leaf scars by 46.6% and pruning wounds by 5.3% in field conditions at leaf fall. Autumn application of B14-1 conidia increased E. nigrum abundance in apple tissues at 10-20 days post-inoculation by ca. 1.5x, but this returned to control levels after one year. E. nigrum B14-1 did not cause detrimental effects on apple foliage, buds, fruit, or growth and could therefore present a new biocontrol agent to manage N. ditissima in commercial apple production.","Papp-Rupar, M; Olivieri, L; Saville, R; Passey, T; Kingsnorth, J; Fagg, G; McLean, H; Xu, XM",AGRICULTURE-BASEL,2023,10.3390/agriculture13040809,0.802456507507687,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999828643113423,1.7135688657727e-4,0.99999996949153,3.05084699725455e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6742,Host species identity in annual Brassicaceae has a limited effect on the assembly of root-endophytic fungal communities,"Background: Establishing the contribution of host plant genotype to the assembly of root-associated microbial communities can be challenging, since multiple ecological factors may confound the effects purely due to the host, and plant species often do not occur sympatrically.Aims: We aimed to measure the relative importance of host plant species on driving the assembly of natural root-endophytic fungal communities, as compared to other habitat conditions that depend on the local environment.Methods: Species of annual wild Brassicaceae and the cultivated Brassica napus were collected in two separate locations, where they grew in close proximity. Arrhentherum elatius (Poaceae) was also collected in both sites and used as outgroup. The root-endophytic fungal communities of these plants were characterised using Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing and cultivation, and compared between locations and hosts.Results: Plant family and sampling location were the factors driving most variation in fungal communities, affecting both community composition and the proportion of cultivable fungi. Whether Brassicaceae were wild or domesticated had little effect on endophytic communities, although its contribution increased when cultivable fungi were considered. No strong specificity of endophytes towards hosts was found, because a core mycobiome was shared by different species.Conclusions: Plant species is a limited predictor of the structure and composition of fungal endophytic communities in roots of annual Brassicaceae, as compared to geographic location. However, the host effect on endophytic assemblages increases with phylogenetic distance between hosts.","Glynou, K; Thines, M; Maciá-Vicente, JG",PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY,2018,10.1080/17550874.2018.1504332,0.940176656527842,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997549930695615,0.0024500693043851,0.999999999528112,4.71888306208257e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2088,Alkaloid Variation Among Epichloid Endophytes of Sleepygrass (Achnatherum robustum) and Consequences for Resistance to Insect Herbivores,"Epichloid endophytes are well known symbionts of many cool-season grasses that may alleviate environmental stresses for their hosts. For example, endophytes produce alkaloid compounds that may be toxic to invertebrate or vertebrate herbivores. Achnatherum robustum, commonly called sleepygrass, was aptly named due to the presence of an endophyte that causes toxic effects to livestock and wildlife. Variation in alkaloid production observed in two A. robustum populations located near Weed and Cloudcroft in the Lincoln National Forest, New Mexico, suggests two different endophyte species are present in these populations. Genetic analyses of endophyte-infected samples revealed major differences in the endophyte alkaloid genetic profiles from the two populations, which were supported with chemical analyses. The endophyte present in the Weed population was shown to produce chanoclavine I, paspaline, and terpendoles, so thus resembles the previously described EpichloA << funkii. The endophyte present in the Cloudcroft population produces chanoclavineI, ergonovine, lysergic acid amide, and paspaline, and is an undescribed endophyte species. We observed very low survival rates for aphids feeding on plants infected with the Cloudcroft endophyte, while aphid survival was better on endophyte infected plants in the Weed population. This observation led to the hypothesis that the alkaloid ergonovine is responsible for aphid mortality. Direct testing of aphid survival on oat leaves supplemented with ergonovine provided supporting evidence for this hypothesis. The results of this study suggest that alkaloids produced by the Cloudcroft endophyte, specifically ergonovine, have insecticidal properties.","Shymanovich, T; Saari, S; Lovin, ME; Jarmusch, AK; Jarmusch, SA; Musso, AM; Charlton, ND; Young, CA; Cech, NB; Faeth, SH",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,2015,10.1007/s10886-014-0534-x,0.979478424477108,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999717173700586,2.8282629941366e-4,0.999999275953401,7.24046598676864e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
20149,Studies on the cost-effective management of Alternaria blight of rapeseed-mustard (Brassica spp.),"Three systemic fungicides: Topsin-M (Thiophanate methyl, 70%WP), Ridomil MZ (Mancozeb, 64% + Metalaxyl, 8%WP), and Bavistin (Carbendazim, 50%WP) alone and in combination with four non-systemic fungicides Captaf (Captan, 50%WP), Indofil M-45 (Mancozeb, 75%WP), Indofil Z-78 (Zineb, 75%WP), and Thiram (Thiram, 75%WP) were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo for their effectiveness to manage Alternaria blight of rapeseed-mustard caused by Alternaria brassicae. A pure culture of the pathogenic fungus was applied in the field at 2 g colonized sorghum seeds kg(-1) soil. All the fungicides were evaluated for their efficacy at various concentrations, 50, 100, 150, 200 and 500 ppm, and were sprayed in the field at 0.2% a.i.l(-1). All fungicides significantly reduced the severity of the disease but Ridomil MZ was most effective. Topsin-M at a concentration of 500 ppm was the most effective in reducing radial growth of the pathogenic fungi (74.2%). Ridomil MZ reduced disease severity by 32% and was followed in effectiveness by the combination Bavistin+Captaf (26.5%). Maximum yield was obtained in plots sprayed with Bavistin+Captaf (1198 kg ha(-1)) followed by Bavistin+Indofil Z-78 (1172 kg ha(-1)). It was worth noting that the highest net profit as well as the highest cost-benefit ratio was obtained with Bavistin+Indofil Z-78 (1:3.2), followed by Bavistin+Captaf (1:1.3).","Khan, MM; Khan, RU; Mohiddin, FA",PHYTOPATHOLOGIA MEDITERRANEA,2007,NA,0.941160051832491,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.86634754726274,0.13365245273726,0.999970740211264,2.92597887355805e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
666,New synergistic co-culture of Corylus avellana cells and Epicoccum nigrum for paclitaxel production,"Paclitaxel is a main impressive chemotherapeutic agent with unique mode of action and broad-spectrum activity against cancers. Hazel (Corylus avellana) is a paclitaxel-producing species through bioprospection. Endophytic fungi have significant roles in plant paclitaxel production. This study evaluated the effect of co-culture of C. avellana cells and paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungus, Epicoccum nigrum strain YEF2 and also the effect of elicitors derived from this fungal strain on paclitaxel production. The results clearly revealed that co-culture of C. avellana cells and E. nigrum was more effective than elicitation of C. avellana cells by only cell extract or culture filtrate of this fungal strain. Co-culture of C. avellana cells and E. nigrum surpassed monocultures in terms of paclitaxel production designating their synergistic interaction potential. Fungal inoculum amount, co-culture establishment time and co-culture period were important factors for achieving the maximum production of paclitaxel in this co-culture system. The highest total yield of paclitaxel (404.5 mu gL(-1)) was produced in co-culture established on 13th day using 3.2% (v/v) of E. nigrum mycelium suspension, which was about 5.5 and 136.6 times that in control cultures of C. avellana cells and E. nigrum, respectively. This is the first report on positive effect of co-culture of paclitaxel-producing endophytic fungus and non-host plant cells for enhancing paclitaxel production.

18032,Biotechnological application of endophytic filamentous bipolaris and curvularia: a review on bioeconomy impact.,"The filamentous Bipolaris and Curvularia genera consist of species known to cause severe diseases in plants and animals amounting to an estimated annual loss of USD $10 billion worldwide. Despite the harmful effect of Bipolaris and Curvularia species, scarce attention is paid on beneficial areas where the fungi are used in industrial processes to generate biotechnological products. Catalytic potential of Bipolaris and Curvularia species in the production of biodiesel, bioflucculant, biosorbent, and mycoherbicide are promising for the bioeconomy. It is herein demonstrated that knowledge-based application of some endophytic Bipolaris and Curvularia species are indispensable vectors of sustainable economic development. In the twenty-first century, India, China, and the USA have taken progress in the biotechnological application of these fungi to generate wealth. As such, some Bipolaris and Curvularia species significantly impact on global crop improvement, act as catalyst in batch-reactors for biosynthesis of industrial enzymes and medicines, bioengineer of green-nanoparticle, agent of biofertilizer, bioremediation and bio-hydrometallurgy.

12761,Hybridization in Populus alters the species composition and interactions of root-colonizing fungi: consequences for host plant performance,"Interactions among plants and soil microbes can significantly influence plant communities, yet we understand little about how hybridization of plant species might alter these interactions. In addition, few studies have explored the effects of different components of soil microbial communities on plant performance. We tested for feedbacks between soil microbes within a Populus hybridizing system using approaches that allowed us to isolate the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and root endophytes. We found significant differences among the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal spore communities cultured from Populus angustifolia James, Populus fremontii S. Watson, and their F1 hybrids. Populus angustifolia cuttings grew 40% larger when inoculated with AM fungal spores from F1 hybrids than with spores from P. fremontii, while growth with spores from P. angustifolia was intermediate. However, parental and hybrid inocula promoted growth equally when soil inoculum was used. Roots inoculated with AM fungal spores alone were colonized principally by AMF, while those inoculated with soil were colonized mostly by dark septate endophytes. These results indicate that genetic variation among hybridizing plant species can influence both microbial communities and their interactions with host plants, but these effects depend upon the type of microbe. Furthermore, our results suggest that interactions among fungi during root colonization may alter the composition and function of the plant microbiome.","Gehring, CA; Ji, BM; Fong, S; Whitham, TG",BOTANY,2014,10.1139/cjb-2013-0174,0.987375941255315,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.921809709042264,0.0781902909577361,0.999999215194566,7.84805433640123e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
21232,[Diversity of endophytic fungi associated with Ferula sinkiangensis K. M. Shen].,"We studied the diversity of endophytic fungi associated with Ferula sinkiangensis K. M. Shen. Endophytic fungi from different years (1-2 years, 3-4 years and > 5 years) and different parts (root, stemand leaf) of Ferula sinkiangensis K. M. Shen were isolated by tissue expand method. Strains were classified by morphology and similarity of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence by Clustal X method. Composition, diversity and preference of endophytic fungal community were analyzed by the isolation rate (IR), isolation frequency (IF), Shannon-Wiener biodiversity index (H'), Margalef Richness index (R). In total 140 endophytic fungi were isolated from F. sinkiangensis K. M. Shen and classified into 18 genera. Among the 140 isolates, Aureobasidium (25.7%), Alternaria (16.4%) and Phyllosticta (15.7%) were the dominant genera. The isolation results show that there were some notable differences between distribution and composition of the endophytic fungi isolated from different years and different parts of Ferula sinkiangensis K. M. Shen. Meanwhile, a certain degree of years and tissue preference were also obvious. The results obtained in this study will be helpful to exploit the endophytic fungal resources of Ferula sinkiangensis K. M.

12305,"Potential Role of Laccases in the Relationship of the Maize Late Wilt Causal Agent,Magnaporthiopsis maydis, and Its Host","Late wilt is a vascular disease of maize (Zea maysL.) caused by the soil-borne and seed-borne fungusMagnaporthiopsis maydis.The pathogen penetrates the roots of maize plants at the seedling stage, grows into the xylem vessels, and gradually spreads upwards. From the flowering stage to the kernel ripening, the fungal hyphae and secreted materials block the water supply in susceptible maize cultivars, leading to rapid dehydration and death. Laccase is an enzyme secreted by fungus for diverse purposes. TheM. maydislaccase gene was identified in our laboratory, but under what conditions it is expressed and to what functions remain unknown. In the current study, we tested the influence of plant age and tissue source (roots or leaves) onM. maydislaccase secretion. The results show increasing laccase secretion as corn parts (as ground tissue) were added to the minimal medium (MM). Furthermore, roots stimulated laccase secretion more than leaves, and adult plants enhanced laccase secretion more than young plants. This implies the possibility that the richer lignin tissue of adult plants may cause increased secretion of the enzyme. In vitro pathogenicity assay proved the ability ofM. maydisto develop inside detached roots of maize, barley, watermelon, and cotton but not peanut. Testing root powder from those plants in MM revealed a negative correlation betweenM. maydisgrowth (expressed as biomass) and laccase secretion. For example, while the addition of maize, barley, or cotton root powder led to increasing fungal dry weight, it also resulted in relatively lower laccase activity. Watermelon and peanut root powder led to opposite responses. These findings suggest a pivotal role of laccase in the ability ofM. maydisto exploit and grow on different host tissues. The results encourage further examination and a deeper understanding of the laccase role in these interesting host-pathogen interactions.","Degani, O; Goldblat, Y",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2020,10.3390/jof6020063,0.80104449205731,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.974885167485665,0.0251148325143354,0.999998650858961,1.3491410393307e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3646,The inconspicuous gatekeeper: endophytic Serendipita vermifera acts as extended plant protection barrier in the rhizosphere,"In nature, beneficial and pathogenic fungi often simultaneously colonise plants. Despite substantial efforts to understand the composition of natural plant-microbe communities, the mechanisms driving such multipartite interactions remain largely unknown. Here we address how the interaction between the beneficial root endophyte Serendipita vermifera and the pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana affects fungal behaviour and determines barley host responses using a gnotobiotic soil-based split-root system. Fungal confrontation in soil resulted in induction of B. sorokiniana genes involved in secondary metabolism and a significant repression of genes encoding putative effectors. In S. vermifera, genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes were strongly induced. This antagonistic response was not activated during the tripartite interaction in barley roots. Instead, we observed a specific induction of S. vermifera genes involved in detoxification and redox homeostasis. Pathogen infection but not endophyte colonisation resulted in substantial host transcriptional reprogramming and activation of defence. In the presence of S. vermifera, pathogen infection and disease symptoms were significantly reduced despite no marked alterations of the plant transcriptional response. The activation of stress response genes and concomitant repression of putative effector gene expression in B. sorokiniana during confrontation with the endophyte suggest a reduction of the pathogen's virulence potential before host plant infection.","Sarkar, D; Rovenich, H; Jeena, G; Nizam, S; Tissier, A; Balcke, GU; Mahdi, LK; Bonkowski, M; Langen, G; Zuccaro, A",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,2019,10.1111/nph.15904,0.973097931787819,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997656411651588,0.00234358834841186,0.999999656233156,3.43766844435045e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1822,Fourteen New Species of Foliar Colletotrichum Associated with the Invasive Plant Ageratina adenophora and Surrounding Crops,"Ageratina adenophora is one of the most invasive weeds in China. Following an outbreak in Yunnan in the 1960s, A. adenophora has been spreading in Southwest China at tremendous speed. Previous research indicated A. adenophora contained many Colletotrichum species as endophytes. In this study, we investigated the diversity of Colletotrichum in healthy and diseased leaves of the invasive plant A. adenophora and several surrounding crops in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guizhou provinces in China, and obtained over 1000 Colletotrichum strains. After preliminary delimitation using the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) sequences, 44 representative strains were selected for further study. Their phylogenetic positions were determined by phylogenetic analyses using combined sequences of ITS, actin (ACT), chitin synthase (CHS-1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and beta-tubulin (TUB2).

14318,Cultural characteristics of fungal endophyte from 3 locoweed species in China,"Locoweeds contain swainsonine-producing fungal endophytes. Endophytes in several locoweed species in China are known to belong to the same taxonomic species of fungus. However, since these endophytes are isolated within their respective hosts and vertically transmitted to seed of the next plant generation, it is likely that the fungal endophytes of the various locoweed species have developed distinctive biological traits. Colony growth rate and morphological characteristics of endophytes from Oxytropis glabra, O. ochrocephala and O. kansuensis (strains LYZ0091, LYZ0093 and LYZ0109, respectively) were studied under different temperature and pH regimes and grown on various media to test this hypothesis. It was found that: 1) The maximum temperature for growth differed between strains (LYZ0109 ceased growth at 30℃, while LYZ0091 and LYZ0093 continued to grow at 30℃); 2) The optimum temperatures for colony growth were 20, 25 and 25℃, respectively, for LYZ0091, LYZ0093, and LYZ0109; 3) The growth rate of LYZ0091 at 5, 10 and 15℃ was significantly (P<0.05) higher than LYZ0109, while significantly (P<0.05) lower than LYZ0109 at 20 and 25℃. 4) No significant growth difference between fungal strains was found over the pH range pH 4 to pH 11; 5) The colony growth rate of strain LYZ0109 was significantly (P<0.05) higher than that of LYZ0091 on NA, PCA, PDA, PSA and WHDA media for most growth measures; 6) No conidia were produced by any fungal strain in any of temperature, pH and media combinations tested; 7) Hyphae of LYZ0091 and LYZ0109 were waved, and seldom produced chlamydospores; hyphae of LYZ093 were straight with plentiful chlamydospores arranged as tree-like structures from the media bottom to the surface.

8581,Structure and Ecological Function of Fungal Endophytes from Stems of Different Mulberry Cultivars,"To explore the microbial community structure and ecological function of mulberry and their potential relationship with the resistance of mulberry, the community structure and function of endophytic fungi in 18 mulberry cultivars were analyzed and predicted by using high-throughput sequencing technology and the FUNGuild database. A total of 352 operational taxonomic units of fungi were observed at a 97% similarity level, representing six phyla of fungi, Fungi_unclassified, Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Zygomycota, Rozellomycota, and Chytridiomycota. Fungi_unclassified was dominant, and Ascomycota was relatively dominant in all cultivars. At the genus level, Ascomycota_unclassified was dominant, and Ampelomyces was relatively dominant, with a richness in TAIWANCHANGGUOSANG 16.47-8975.69 times that in the other cultivars. Classified Ascomycota_unclassified was 4.75-296.65 times more common in NANYUANSIJI than in the other cultivars. Based on the FUNGuild analysis method, we successfully annotated six nutrient types, namely, pathotroph, pathotroph-saprotroph, pathotroph-saprotroph-symbiotroph, saprotroph, saprotroph-symbiotroph, and symbiotroph, among which saprophytic-symbiotic accounted for the largest proportion and was absolutely dominant in TWC. This research suggests that community composition differs among cultivars and that the diversity and richness of endophytic fungi in resistant cultivars are higher than those in susceptible cultivars. The ecological functions of cultivars with different resistances are quite different.","Peng, FF; Li, XL; Wei, ZX; Luo, YJ; Wang, W; Han, GH",CURRENT MICROBIOLOGY,2023,10.1007/s00284-023-03504-9,0.995419140553403,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.974434568122697,0.0255654318773034,0.999999623255626,3.7674437391999e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16294,Endophytic fungal community structure and dynamic changes of dominant flora in different ages of Eucommia ulmoides; [不同树龄杜仲内生真菌群落结构解析及优势菌群动态变化],"Objective To observe the composition, abundance and diversity of endophytic fungal communities in different ages of Eucommia ulmoides, and compare the dynamic changes with seasons of the dominant populations of endophytic fungi in different ages of Eucommia ulmoides. Methods Leaves and branches of different ages of Eucommia ulmoides were collected and the endophytic fungal community structure was analyzed using Illumina HiSeq High-throughput sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis was performed. Results There were many shared operational taxonomic units (OTUs) among different ages of Eucommia ulmoides. The lower the age of Eucommia ulmoides, the higher the number of unique OTUs. The differences in the alpha diversity indices of endophytic fungal communities among different ages of Eucommia ulmoides were not significant. The higher the age of Eucommia ulmoides, the higher the alpha diversity index. The difference in the endophytic fungal community composition between 67-year-old and 45-year-old Eucommia ulmoides was small, while that between 28-year-old Eucommia ulmoides and the other two groups was large. The dominant phylum in Eucommia ulmoides was Ascomycota, followed by Basidiomycota. There were nine dominant genera shared by different ages of Eucommia ulmoides, including Devriesia, Diaporthe, Trichomerium, Sphaerulina, Aureobasidium, Paramycosphaerella, Nigrospora, Sarocladium and Pichia, which constitute the core endophytic fungal group of Eucommia ulmoides. Trichomerium and Sphaerulina only had high relative abundance in spring, Paramycosphaerella only had high relative abundance in summer, while Nigrospora, Sarocladium and Pichia only had high relative abundance in autumn. Based on the FUNGuild forecast, the dominant groups of endophytic fungi in Eucommia ulmoides were mainly phytopathogens and undefined saprophytes. Conclusion There are core endophytic fungal group in Eucommia ulmoides. The relative abundance of endophytic fungal dominant genera varied among different ages of Eucommia ulmoides, and the species of dominant genera succeed with seasonal changes. The age of trees is an important factor that causes differences in the structure and diversity of endophytic fungal communities of Eucommia ulmoides in the same habitat. © 2024 Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Microecology.

9009,An endophytic Schizophyllum commune possessing antioxidant activity exhibits genoprotective and organprotective effects in fresh water fish Channa punctatus exposed to bisphenol A,"Background: Oxidative stress is responsible for the onset of several chronic and degenerative diseases. Exogenous supply of antioxidants is reported to neutralize the effects of oxidative stress. Several synthetic antioxidants suffer from various side effects which necessitates the exploration of antioxidant compounds from natural sources. Endophytic fungi residing in the plants are gaining the attention of researchers as a source of novel antioxidants. Majority of the research conducted so far on endophytic fungi has been restricted to the members of phylum ascomycota. Basidiomycota, inspite of their immense bioactive potential remain relatively unexploited. This study aimed to assess the ameliorative effects of an endophytic Schizophyllum commune (basidiomycetous fungus) against oxidative stress associated altered antioxidant levels, genotoxicity and cellular damage to different organs in bisphenol A exposed fresh water fish Channa punctatus. Results: Good antioxidant and genoprotective potential was exhibited by S. commune extract in in vitro studies conducted using different antioxidant, DNA damage protection, and cytokinesis blocked micronuclei assays. In vivo studies were performed in fresh water fish Channa punctatus exposed to bisphenol A. A significant decrease in the considered parameters for DNA damage (% micronuclei and comet assay) were recorded in fish treated with S. commune extract on comparison with untreated bisphenol A exposed group.

11201,Dissipation of propiconazole and tebuconazole in peppermint crops (Mentha piperita (Labiatae)) and their residues in distilled oils,"The broad-spectrum, systemic fungicides propiconazole (1) and tebuconazole (2) are used to control rust in peppermint (Mentha piperita L.). An analytical method, using gas chromatography combined with detection by high-resolution mass spectrometry, was developed to allow for the simultaneous monitoring of both pesticides in peppermint leaves and oil. Field trials were established to determine the rate of dissipation of tebuconazole and propiconazole in peppermint crops. Three applications of each fungicide were trialed at two rates (125 and 250 g of active ingredient (ai)/ha). At harvest, 64 days after the final application, propiconazole was detected at levels of 0.06 mg/kg and 0.09 mg/kg of dry weight, and tebuconazole was detected at 0.26 and 0.80 mg/kg dry weight, in identical trials. Rates of dissipation of propiconazole and tebuconazole were lower at a second trial site, where three applications of 125 g/ka ai for each fungicide resulted in residue levels of 0.21 mg/kg for both pesticides, detected 89 days after the last application. Propiconazole and tebuconazole were detected in the distilled oil at levels between 0.02 and 0.05 mg/kg and between 0.011 and 0.041 mg/kg, respectively. Propiconazole had a higher tendency to co-distill with the peppermint oil, with 0.7% of that present in the vegetative material ending up in the oil, compared to 0.09% of tebuconazole.","Garland, SM; Menary, RC; Davies, NW",JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY,1999,10.1021/jf980120e,0.949509377663793,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.812911061037406,0.18708893896259499,0.999999848719355,1.51280644788976e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

In this study, we isolated and characterized 82 endophytic bacteria from the root nodules of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) grown in a Pb-Zn mining area. There were 80 isolates showing resistance to four HMs, 0.01-18.0 mM/L for Cd, 0.2-40.0 mM/L for Zn, 0.3-2.2 mM/L for Pb, and 0.2-1.4 mM/L for Cu.

Two symbiotic isolates selected with the highest potential for HM resistance and PGP traits, designated Mesorhizobium loti HZ76 and Agrobacterium radiobacter HZ6, were evaluated for promotion of plant growth and metal uptake by R. pseudoacacia seedlings grown in pots containing different levels of Cd, Zn, Pb, or Cu. HZ76 significantly increased plant shoot biomass, while HZ6 did not, compared with non-inoculated controls. The results indicate that inoculation with HZ76 or HZ6 relieved HM stress in the plants, depending on the type and concentration of HM in the treatment. Mesorhizobium loti HZ76 may be a better candidate for application in phytoremediation than A. radiobacter HZ6.

17205,Endophytes as producers of peptides: an overview about the recently discovered peptides from endophytic microbes.,"An endophyte is a fungus or bacterium that lives within a plant in a symbiotic relationship. Extensive colonization of the plant tissue by endophytes creates a barrier effect, where they outcompete and prevent pathogenic organisms from taking hold. This happens by producing secondary metabolites that inhibit the growth of the competitors or pathogens. In this way they play a very important role in the plant defence mechanisms. The metabolites produced by these endophytes fall within a wide range of classes of compounds that include peptides which are the focus of this review. Peptides are increasingly being selected for drug development because they are specific for their targets and have a higher degree of interactions. There have been quite a number of endophytic peptides reported in the recent past indicating that endophytes can be used for the production of peptide based drugs. Molecular screening for NRPS, which shows peptide producing capability, has also shown that endophytes are potential producers of peptides. The presence of NRPS also offers the possibility of genetic modifications which may generate peptides with high pharmacological activities. This review, therefore, aims to show the current status of peptides isolated from endophytic bacteria and fungi in the recent decade. Endophytes as potential sources of peptides according to NRPS studies will also be discussed.",Abdalla MA; Matasyoh JC,Natural products and bioprospecting,2014,10.1007/s13659-014-0038-y,0.952696874491899,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995657793942579,0.00434220605742078,0.999999999405139,5.9486116033014e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The current work involved purification and characterization of the lipase from an endophytic-bacteria isolated from the stem of Withania somnifera L. Dunal. Based on the analysis of morphology and 16S rDNA sequence, the endophytic bacteria was identified as Bacillus pumilus and designated as B. pumilus WSS5. Purified lipase from the B. pumilus WSS5 was found to be of 27KDa as revealed by SDS-PAGE with optimum activity at 37 & DEG;C and pH 8. The stability of the enzyme in presence of various metal ions, surfactants, inhibitors, and organic solvents suggested that this enzyme could be exploited in leather and detergent industries. In addition, the stain removal potential of the crude and purified lipase was determined on cotton fabric pieces stained with vegetable oil. Lipase added to water along with detergent significantly enhanced the stain removal efficiency of a commercially available detergent. The current findings suggest the potential of B. pumilusWSS5 lipase owing to promising properties such as the alkali-thermostability, organic solventtolerance, and broad substrate specificity that makes it a strong candidate for application in detergent formulations, biotransformation, industries, and medicine.

Out of 36 endophytic fungi segregated from symptomless roots of apple, wheat, maize, marigold, cherry, and garlic plants, only 9 isolates showed inhibitory effect during preliminary screening and were further assayed under in vitro, pot, and field conditions against the white root rot pathogen/disease. Under in vitro conditions, maximum mycelial inhibition of 81.48% was obtained with the isolate Aspergillus aculeatus strain C2. Microscopic studies on interaction between fungal endophyte with hyphal tips of D. necatrix revealed various morphological abnormalities in the hyphae. In glasshouse conditions, seed treatment pursued by soil application with Crinipellis tabtim strain M8 isolate was highly effective and exhibited 93.55% disease control. Similarly, under field conditions, the overall maximum disease control was exhibited by Crinipellis tabtim strain M8 (84.95%). The most promising root endophytes that were identified rely on morphological and ITS sequence analysis. Root colonization assay was performed which revealed maximum endosphere and rhizosphere colonization with Crinipellis tabtim strain M8. Additionally, confocal microscopic illustrations of transverse sections of root cells tenanted by fungal endophytes as compared to untreated control suggested the persistence and establishment of endophytes in the endosphere of apple seedlings.

8742,Detection of postharvest pathogenic fungi by RNA markers in high-throughput platform on streptavidin plate,"Postharvest pathogenic fungi cause rots and major losses in harvested crops worldwide. Therefore, advanced disease detection and decay prevention in crops are essential to minimize these rots. In this study, oligonucleotides-based detection was integrated into an adapted commercial well-plate reader to enable a high-throughput biosensor monitoring system for the detection of RNA-markers of quiescent fungi in harvested crops. The streptavidin commercial 96-well plates were functionalized with complementary strands to the target RNA-markers of quiescent fungal-pathogens Alternaria alternata and Botrytis cinerea. After exposure to the target sample, the target RNA sequence binds to the immobilized surface DNA strand. Then, a reporter DNA strand binds to the target RNA. The reporter DNA that is linked to the fluorophore Texas-Red produces a light signal, which is detected by the plate reader. Firstly, the assay functionality was optimized with the surface DNA strand and reporter DNA strand concentrations of 100 nM and 250 nM, respectively. Then, the specificity of the platform was examined against several non-specific target DNA markers from different pathogenic fungi. The light intensity signals were significantly higher by 3.6- and 4.9-fold as compared to the control in the markers of Botrytis cinerea and Alternaria alternata, respectively. The biosensor demonstrated highly sensitive detection for both Botrytis cinerea (LOD = 0.657 nM RNA), and Alternaria alternata (LOD = 0.533 nM RNA), which was validated with biological samples.

11848,Effect of drought on the growth of Lolium perenne genotypes with and without fungal endophytes,"1. Grass leaves are often inhabited by fungal endophytes that can enhance host growth. In some forage species, endophytes improve host resistance to, and recovery from, drought. 2. Our objective was to determine if the growth of genotypes of Lolium perenne L. was improved by endophytes during recovery from drought. 3. Thirteen infected genotypes were cloned into ramets. Half were treated with a systemic fungicide to eliminate the endophyte (E-); half were untreated and retained high endophyte levels (E+). In a glasshouse, half of all E- and E+ ramets were watered regularly, whilst half were exposed to a 2 week drought on two occasions, each followed by a 3 week recovery period. 4. After the first drought and recovery period, endophytes significantly reduced tiller production in the drought-stressed group. 5. After the second drought and recovery period, effects of drought on live leaf area and dry mass were highly dependent on host genotype, but not endophytes. The mean tiller mass of E+ ramets after drought was significantly less than that of watered E+ ramets, but this was not true in E- ramets. For six genotypes there was greater mass allocation to storage in the tiller bases of E- ramets after drought. 6. This perennial ryegrass population showed marked genotypic variation in the ability to recover from drought stress, but endophytes played little or no role in this ability. For some host genotypes there may be a metabolic cost of harbouring endophytes during environmentally stressful conditions.","Cheplick, GP; Perera, A; Koulouris, K",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,2000,10.1046/j.1365-2435.2000.00466.x,0.970498875557308,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990500715102877,0.0094992848971229,0.99999999987319,1.2680989591729002e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19119,Cereals can trap endophytic bacteria with potential beneficial traits when grown ex-situ in harsh soils.,"Microbial communities associated with plants growing in harsh conditions, including salinity and water deficiency, have developed adaptive features which permit them to grow and survive under extreme environmental conditions. In the present study, an ex-situ plant trapping method has been applied to collect the culturable microbial diversity associated with the soil from harsh and remote areas. Oryza sativa cv. Baldo and Triticum durum Primadur plants were used as recruiters, while the soil surrounding the roots of Oryza glaberrima plants from remote regions of Mali (West Africa) was used as substrate for their growth. The endophytic communities recruited by the two plant species belonged to Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, and the dominant genera were Bacillus, Kosakonia, and Enterobacter. These endophytes were characterized by analyzing some of the most common plant growth promoting traits. Halotolerant, inorganic phosphate-solubilizing and N-fixing strains were found, and some of them simultaneously showing these three traits. We verified that 'Baldo' recruited mostly halotolerant and P-solubilizers endophytes, while the endophytes selected by 'Primadur' were mainly N-fixers. The applied ex-situ plant trapping method allowed to isolate endophytes with potential beneficial traits that could be applied for the improvement of rice and wheat growth under adverse environmental conditions.",Amenta ML; Vaccaro F; Varriale S; Sangaré JR; Defez R; Mengoni A; Bianco C,FEMS microbiology ecology,2024,10.1093/femsec/fiae041,0.958586128266251,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995033820810832,0.00496617918916796,0.999993739882952,6.26011704840668e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12585,Improved Taxol production by combination of inducing factors in suspension cell culture of Taxus baccata,"To date enormous attempts have been devoted to improve Taxol production exploiting various methodologies from bioprocess engineering to biotechnological and synthetic approaches. We have developed a 2-stage suspension cell culture of Taxus baccata L. using modified B5 medium in order to improve cell growth as well as productivity. After callus induction and cell line selection, B5 medium was supplemented with vanadyl sulfate (0.1 mg/l), silver nitrate (0.3 mg/l) and cobalt chloride (0.25 mg/l) at the first day of stage I culture to maximize cell growth. This medium was further supplemented with sucrose (1%) and ammonium citrate (50 mg/l) on day 10 and sucrose (1%) and phenylalanine (0.1 mM) on day 20 (i.e., biomass growth medium). At stage II (day 25), two different concentrations of several elicitors such as methyl jasmonate (10 or 20 mg/l), salicylic acid (50 or 100 mg/l) and fungal elicitor (25 or 50 mg/l) were added to the biomass growth medium with the aim of improving cellular productivity. For morphological analysis, microscopic inspection was carried out during cultivation. Cell-associated and extracellular amount of Taxol were detected and measured using HPLC methodology. At stage I, overall Taxol amount of biomass growth medium was 13.75 mg/l (i.e., 5.6-fold higher than that of untreated B5 control). At stage II, treated cells with methyl jasmonate (10 mg/l), salicylic acid (100 mg/l) and fungal elicitor (25 mg/l) produced the highest amount of Taxol (39.5 mg/l), which is 16-fold higher than that of untreated B5 control (2.45 mg/l). Microscopic analyses of Taxus cells in suspension cultures showed various positional auto-fluorescence showing direct correlation with Taxol production. Our studies revealed that intervallic supplementation of B5 medium with combination of biomass growth factors at stage I and mixture of elicitors at stageII could significantly increase Taxol production. Thus, we suggest that the exploitation of this methodology may improve the production of Taxol since demands for Taxol pharmaceuticals are increasingly growing and resource paucities have limited its direct harvesting from Taxus trees.

Its farming is being promoted in Colombia as an alternative to traditional crops, especially among small and medium farmers. Existing crops have a limited genetic base and are therefore susceptible to biotic stress, particularly those caused by viruses and fungi. Wild vanilla can be a source of variability that could help increase its gene pool and could also provide naturally associated endophyte microorganisms with antagonistic properties to fight pathogens of farmed vanilla. In this study we assessed the understanding of vanilla cultivation as well as the diversity of the genus Vanilla in Colombia. As a result of this first phase of research, we found twenty species of Colombian vanilla and 60 morphospecies of endophytic microorganisms.

15189,Response of photosynthetic characteristics of Astragalus to high temperature stress and influencing factor analysis under DSE inoculation; [接种 DSE 下黄芪光合特征对高温胁迫的响应及因素分析],"Dark septate endophyte (DSE) improving the growth ability of plants to cope with adversity has always been a research hotspot. In this study the response of photosynthetic characteristics of Astragalus to high temperature stress and its influencing factors under DSE inoculation (Alternaria sp.) were observed. Astragalus membranaceus was used as the test object and 42 °C high temperature stress treatment was carried out. The stress duration of 1, 3, 7 and 11 days, and 3 replicates for each treatment were set up. The soil chemical properties, root indexes, leaf morphology and photosynthetic characteristics were determined. The results showed that with the increase of high temperature stress time, the leaf area, stomatal opening density, chlorophyll content and root tip number of inoculated and uninoculated Astragalus plants reduced by 55.5%–66.3%, 69.6%–81.0%, 68.2%–81.2% and 56.7%–59.8%, respectively. However, inoculation with DSE Alternaria sp. increased leaf circumference and area, stomatal opening density, chlorophyll content, transpiration rate and net photosynthetic rate (P<0.05) of the plants, indicating that inoculation with DSE significantly reduced the influence of high temperature on the photosynthetic characteristics of Astragalus membranaceus, and improved the ability of the Astragalus plants to resist high temperature stress. Further analysis of principal component and structural equation models showed that soil available phosphorus, available potassium, root length, chlorophyll a, stomatal opening density and net photosynthetic rate were significantly positive (P<0.05), indicating that inoculation with DSE could improve the photosynthetic rate of Astragalus by adjusting the root system, leaf photosynthetic pigment, stomata and other indicators. The research results provide a scientific basis for the resource utilization of DSE under high temperature adversity. Copyright © 2023 Institute of Microbiology, CAS.

8606,Metabolomic Tools to Assess the Chemistry and Bioactivity of Endophytic Aspergillus Strain,"Endophytic fungi associated with medicinal plants are a potential source of novel chemistry and biology that may find applications as pharmaceutical and agrochemical drugs. In this study, a combination of metabolomics and bioactivity-guided approaches were employed to isolate secondary metabolites with cytotoxicity against cancer cells from an endophytic Aspergillus aculeatus. The endophyte was isolated from the Egyptian medicinal plant Terminalia laxiflora and identified using molecular biological methods. Metabolomics and dereplication studies were accomplished by utilizing the MZmine software coupled with the universal Dictionary of Natural Products database. Metabolic profiling, with aid of multivariate data analysis, was performed at different stages of the growth curve to choose the optimized method suitable for up-scaling. The optimized culture method yielded a crude extract abundant with biologically-active secondary metabolites. Crude extracts were fractionated using different high-throughput chromatographic techniques. Purified compounds were identified by HR-ESI-MS, 1D- and 2D-NMR. This study introduced a new method of dereplication utilizing both high-resolution mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy. The metabolites were putatively identified by applying a chemotaxonomic filter. We also present a short review on the diverse chemistry of terrestrial endophytic strains of Aspergillus, which has become a part of our dereplication work and this will be of wide interest to those working in this field.","Tawfike, AF; Tate, R; Abbott, G; Young, L; Viegelmann, C; Schumacher, M; Diederich, M; Edrada-Ebel, R",CHEMISTRY & BIODIVERSITY,2017,10.1002/cbdv.201700040,0.916563299273206,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.976603635450057,0.023396364549943,0.999999997075476,2.92452373429342e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

However, there is preliminary evidence from both laboratory and animal-based studies that some fungi may suppress enteric methanogenesis. This study determined the antimethanogenic potential of a range of endophytic (Neotyphodium species) and saprophytic (Geotrichum, Monascus, Mortierella and Penicillium species) fungi. Candidate fungi were selected on the basis of their production of various classes of secondary compounds and screened in an in vitro batch-culture fermentation assay. No strains of endophyte in ryegrass or tall fescue suppressed methanogenesis compared with their endophyte-free controls. The supernatant fractions from three strains of Mortierella wolfii were the most promising fungi identified. They suppressed methanogenesis as effectively as an inhibitor of methanogenesis (bromoethane sulphonate at 30 µmoles/L), without also reducing overall fermentation. These strains should be investigated further by screening fresh cultures grown under contrasting conditions to establish some variation in putative bioactive compounds. © 2012 The Royal Society of New Zealand.",Cosgrove G.P.; Muetzel S.; Skipp R.A.; Mace W.J.,New Zealand Journal of Agricultural Research,2012,10.1080/00288233.2012.693106,0.97414960061318,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.902789207867493,0.0972107921325068,0.999989143794742,1.08562052576477e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
4432,Tolerance of tomato plants to water stress is improved by the root endophyte Fusarium solani FsK,"The endophyte Fusarium solani strain FsK may colonize the roots of tomato plants and protect them against fungal pathogens. Here we show that the fungus can alleviate the strong negative effects of water stress on the development and growth of tomato seedlings that were co-cultivated with FsK under in vitro conditions. In a succeeding pot experiment, the presence of FsK ameliorated physiological stress in plants grown in peat under water deficit irrigation conditions: plants practically restored levels of net photosynthesis rate (P-N), maximal potential yield of PSII (F-v/F-m) and relative water content (% RWC) and displayed a 4-fold increase in stomatal conductivity (g(s)) and a 7-fold decrease in proline levels compared to mock-inoculated plants. These changes indicate a shift towards an anisohydric type response to water stress, aided by mechanisms maintaining efficient water absorption by roots and high-water conductance in planta. Effects on the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and relevant antioxidant enzymes were less dramatic. Our data indicate that the endophyte may reduce stomatal closure response to water stress, and potentially improve water acquisition by roots and/or water conductance in planta, thus preventing reduction in photosynthesis rates and minimizing water loss; this, results in increased tolerance of tomato plants to water deprivation, conferred by the endophyte.","Kavroulakis, N; Doupis, G; Papadakis, IE; Ehaliotis, C; Papadopoulou, KK",RHIZOSPHERE,2018,10.1016/j.rhisph.2018.04.003,0.904625618120414,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.752141654508419,0.247858345491581,0.999996469512381,3.53048761903008e-6,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

Pusa Basmati-1) and non-aromatic (cv. BPT-5204) rice-genotypes grown in the mountain and plateau-zones of India by both metagenomic NGS (mNGS) and conventional microbiological methods. Microbiome analysis by sequencing V3-V4 region of ribosomal gene revealed marginally more bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTU) in the mountain zone at Palampur and Almora than plateau zone at Hazaribagh. Interestingly, the rice leaf endophytic microbiomes in mountain zone were found clustered separately from that of plateau-zone. The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity indices indicated influence of geographical location as compared to genotype per se for shaping rice endophytic microbiome composition. Bacterial phyla, Proteobacteria followed by Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were found abundant in all three locations.

Such surroundings are known to make plants dependent on symbiosis with other organisms. Up to now only arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were found to act as endophytic symbiosis partners for A. montana. Here we identified five Streptomyces strains, microorganisms also known to occur as endophytes in plants and to produce a huge variety of active secondary metabolites, as inhabitants of A. montana. The secondary metabolite spectrum of these strains does not contain sesquiterpene lactones, but consists of the glutarimide antibiotics cycloheximide and actiphenol as well as the diketopiperazines cyclo-prolyl-valyl, cyclo-prolyl-isoleucyl, cyclo-prolyl-leucyl and cyclo-prolyl-phenylalanyl. Notably, genome analysis of one strain was performed and indicated a huge genome size with a high number of natural products gene clusters among which genes for cycloheximide production were detected. Only weak activity against the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus was revealed, but the extracts showed a marked cytotoxic activity as well as an antifungal activity against Candida parapsilosis and Fusarium verticillioides. Altogether, our results provide evidence that A. montana and its endophytic Streptomyces benefit from each other by completing their protection against competitors and pathogens and by exchanging plant growth promoting signals with nutrients.","Wardecki, T; Brötz, E; De Ford, C; von Loewenich, FD; Rebets, Y; Tokovenko, B; Luzhetskyy, A; Merfort, I",ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY,2015,10.1007/s10482-015-0492-5,0.985128428907859,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999906311033573,9.36889664268159e-5,0.999999999519157,4.80842698991069e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Previous studies have shown that extracts from this plant have antiplasmodial activity. Aim of the study: This study aimed to explore the endophyic fungi associated with some parts of this plant for their ability to produce antiplasmodial metabolites. Materials and methods: One hundred and fifty-two endophytic fungi isolated from twelve different organs of A. muricata were cultured and the ethyl acetate extracts of conditioned media screened for antiplasmodial activity using the 96-well microtiter plate format SYBR green florescence assay against Chloroquine-sensitive Pf3D7 and Chloroquine-resistant PfINDO/PfDd2 strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Results: Twenty-seven (17.76%) of fungi tested were found to completely inhibit the growth of Plasmodium parasites at 10 mu g/mL. The 5.8S rDNA sequencing data revealed the strongly active (IC50 < 2 mu g/mL against at least 2 P. falciparum strains) isolates to be Trichoderma afroharzianum AMrb7, Penicillium citrinum AMrb11, Neocosmospora rubicola AMb22, Penicillium tropicum AMb3, Penicillium citrinum AMrb23, Aspergillus versicolor AMb7, and Fusarium sp AMst1. Of these, the extracts from Penicillium citrinum AMrb11 (IC50 0.84-0.93 mu g/mL) and Neocosmospora rubicola AMb22 (IC50 0.39-1.92 mu g/mL) showed the highest promise against all three plasmodial strains with selectivity indices ranging from 34.71 to 180.97. Dynamic head space GC-MS analysis of ethyl acetate extracts of promising fungi revealed broad-spectrum antimicrobial compounds such as Penicidin, Aromadendrene, Ethyl p-methoxycinnamate, 2-Coumaranone and 2-Methyl resorcinol.

11009,Combined inhibition of class 1-PI3K-alpha and delta isoforms causes senolysis by inducing p21<SUP>WAF1/CIP1</SUP> proteasomal degradation in senescent cells,"The targeted elimination of radio- or chemotherapy-induced senescent cells by so-called senolytic substances represents a promising approach to reduce tumor relapse as well as therapeutic side effects such as fibrosis. We screened an in-house library of 178 substances derived from marine sponges, endophytic fungi, and higher plants, and determined their senolytic activities towards DNA damage-induced senescent HCT116 colon carcinoma cells. The Pan-PI3K-inhibitor wortmannin and its clinical derivative, PX-866, were identified to act as senolytics. PX-866 potently induced apoptotic cell death in senescent HCT116, MCF-7 mammary carcinoma, and A549 lung carcinoma cells, independently of whether senescence was induced by ionizing radiation or by chemotherapeutics, but not in proliferating cells. Other Pan-PI3K inhibitors, such as the FDA-approved drug BAY80-6946 (Copanlisib, Aliqopa (R)), also efficiently and specifically eliminated senescent cells. Interestingly, only the simultaneous inhibition of both PI3K class I alpha (with BYL-719 (Alpelisib, Piqray (R))) and delta (with CAL-101 (Idelalisib, Zydelig (R))) isoforms was sufficient to induce senolysis, whereas single application of these inhibitors had no effect. On the molecular level, inhibition of PI3Ks resulted in an increased proteasomal degradation of the CDK inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1) in all tumor cell lines analyzed. This led to a timely induction of apoptosis in senescent tumor cells. Taken together, the senolytic properties of PI3K-inhibitors reveal a novel dimension of these promising compounds, which holds particular potential when employed alongside DNA damaging agents in combination tumor therapies.","Neuwahl, J; Neumann, CA; Fitz, AC; Biermann, AD; Magel, M; Friedrich, A; Sellin, L; Stork, B; Piekorz, RP; Proksch, P; Budach, W; Jaenicke, RU; Sohn, D",CELL DEATH & DISEASE,2024,10.1038/s41419-024-06755-x,0.97160535578372,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.930113016368215,0.0698869836317847,0.99999998625074,1.37492602858558e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
8283,"An endophytic fungus, Piriformospora indica, enhances drought tolerance of trifoliate orange by modulating the antioxidant defense system and composition of fatty acids","A cultivable endophytic fungus, Piriformospora indica, improves growth and enhances stress tolerance of host plants, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We hypothesized that P. indica enhanced the drought tolerance of the host by regulating the antioxidant defense system and composition of fatty acids. Trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata) seedlings were inoculated with P. indica under ample water and drought stress to analyze the change in plant growth, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, antioxidant enzyme activities, non-enzymatic antioxidant concentrations, fatty acid compositions, and expressions of both antioxidant enzyme genes and fatty acid desaturase (FAD) genes. The 9-week soil water deficit significantly increased the colonization of P. indica to roots, and P. indica promoted the increase of shoot biomass under drought. Soil drought triggered an elevation of hydrogen peroxide in roots, while the inoculated plants had lower levels of ROS (hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion radicals) and lower degree of membrane lipid peroxidation (based on malondialdehyde levels) under drought. Drought treatment also elevated ascorbic acid and glutathione concentrations, and the elevation was further amplified after P. indica inoculation. Inoculated plants under drought also recorded significantly higher iron-superoxide dismutase (Fe-SOD), manganese-superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), peroxidases, catalase, glutathione reductase and ascorbate peroxidase activities, accompanied by up-regulation of PtFe-SOD and PtCu/Zn-SOD expressions. Inoculation with P. indica significantly increased total saturated fatty acids (e.g., C6:0, C15:0, C16:0, C23:0 and C24:0) concentration and reduced total unsaturated fatty acids (e.g., C18:1N9C, C18:2N6, C18:3N3, C18:1N12 and C19:1N9T) concentrations, leading to a decrease in the unsaturation index of fatty acids, which may be associated with the up-regulation of PtFAD2 and PtFAD6 and down-regulation of Pt Delta 9. It was concluded that the colonization of P. indica can activate enzyme and non-enzyme defense systems and regulate the composition of fatty acids under drought, thus alleviating the oxidative damage to the host caused by drought.","Cao, JL; He, WX; Zou, YN; Wu, QS",TREE PHYSIOLOGY,2023,10.1093/treephys/tpac126,0.946952453020437,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992352256068684,0.00764774393131639,0.999999961754268,3.82457321368435e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16544,Endogenous toxins and mycotoxins in forage grasses and their effects on livestock.,"Plant toxins are the chemical defenses of plants against herbivory. Grasses have relatively few intrinsic toxins, relying more on growth habit to survive defoliation and endophytic fungal toxins as chemical defenses. Forage grasses that contain intrinsic toxins include Phalaris spp. (tryptamine and carboline alkaloids), sorghums (cyanogenic glycosides), and tropical grasses containing oxalates and saponins. Toxic effects of these grasses include neurological damage (Phalaris staggers), hypoxia (sudangrass), saponin-induced photosensitization (Brachiaria and Panicum spp.), and bone demineralization (oxalate-containing grasses). Endophytic toxins in grasses include ergot alkaloids in tall fescue and tremorgens (e.g., lolitrem B) in perennial ryegrass. Lolitrems cause neurological effects, producing the ryegrass staggers syndrome. Annual ryegrass toxicosis is caused by corynetoxins, which are chemically similar to tunicamycin antibiotics. Corynetoxins are produced by Clavibacter bacteria that parasitize a nematode, Anguina agrostis, that may infect annual ryegrass. Corynetoxins inhibit glycoprotein synthesis, causing defective formation of various blood components of the reticulo-endothelial system. Another mycotoxin in ryegrass is sporidesmin, which causes liver damage and secondary photosensitization (facial eczema). Fusarium toxins such as zearalenone and trichothecenes also occur in forage grasses. Kikuyugrass poisoning results in severe damage to the ruminal epithelium and omasal mucosa, and neurological signs. The causative agent, which may be associated with army worm predation of the grass, has not been identified.

10819,Effects of Piriformospora indica on rooting and growth of tissue-cultured banana (Musa acuminata cv. Tianbaojiao) seedlings,"Piriformospora indica is a plant growth- and disease resistance-promoting fungus in the Sebacinales family. In this study, the effect of this symbiotic fungus on the growth of tissue-cultured banana seedlings was investigated to explore its potential applications in the banana tissue culture industry. P. indica plugs (P-1) and a P. indica chlamydospore suspension (P-2) were co-cultured with banana seedlings in rooting medium to investigate their growth-promoting efficiency. Both the P-1 and P-2 treatments improved the plant biomass and chlorophyll contents of banana seedlings. The P-2 treatment had stronger promoting effects than the P-1 treatment, especially on plant height and root length in the first 3 weeks. At 4 weeks after inoculation, seedlings in the P-1 and P-2 treatments showed increased plant height, more and longer roots, increased shoot fresh weight, leaf width and length, and stem circumference compared with controls. The P. indica treatments also significantly enhanced the chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total chlorophyll, and carotenoid contents in banana leaves. The results of this study verified that the fungus can facilitate the growth of banana seedlings in vitro and shorten the rooting time of tissue-cultured banana seedlings. Therefore, it has the potential to improve the growth and quality of tissue-cultured banana plants.","Dan, L; Mensah, RA; Fan, L; Na, T; Quan, Q; Yeha, K; Xu, XH; Chen, CZ; Lai, ZX",SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE,2019,10.1016/j.scienta.2019.108649,0.974861684909251,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999502996666236,4.9700333376379e-4,0.999999809157383,1.90842616709652e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Here we examine the draft genome sequence of Burkholderia sp. LS-044, an antibiotic-resistant endophytic strain affiliated to the Bcc (ST895) inhabiting rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. Tainung 71) root. Antimicrobial susceptibility of LS-044 was evaluated comparatively with other Burkholderia sp. (CC-Al74 and CC-3XP9) using commercial ATB PSE 5 test strips. The genome of LS-044 was sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform. Plant probiotic and antimicrobial resistance genes were screened by Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (RAST), CARD 2017, NCBI and/or UniProt. Plant-associated members of Bcc (LS-044 and CC-Al74) exhibited greater resistance to the majority of antibiotics tested. The draft genome sequence of LS-044 contained 8.78 Mbp in 62 contigs having a G + C content of 66.5%, 8868 coding sequences and 75 RNAs. The genome harboured genes coding for LysR-type β-lactamase transcription regulator, classes A, C and D β-lactamases, several metal-dependent β-lactamases, antibiotic efflux proteins, and proteins conferring resistance to colistin, streptothricin, colicin and fluoroquinolones. Similarly, it also possessed genes for copper homeostasis, copper-cobalt-zinc-cadmium-chromium resistance and reduction of mercury.

It is produced by a number of plants, including Nothapodytes nimmoniana (Grahm) Mabb. (Icacinaceae), occurring naturally in the Western Ghats, India. The plant is inhabited by a number of endophytic fungi, many of which have been isolated and shown to produce CPT, in culture, independent of the host. In this article, we examine the sensitivity of endophytic fungi isolated from N. nimmoniana to CPT. Contrary to our hypothesis that these fungi should be resistant to CPT (as they are exposed to host CPT as well as that produced by themselves), we report that these fungi are sensitive and thus inhibited by CPT. We discuss these results in the context of the role of CPT in limiting endophytic fungal growth.","Shweta, S; Shivanna, MB; Gurumurthy, BR; Shaanker, RU; Kumar, TRS; Ravikanth, G",CURRENT SCIENCE,2014,NA,0.962394664489944,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.982451518409598,0.0175484815904023,0.999990180486852,9.81951314782403e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Fungal communities showed low diversity; the 680 clones belonged to 93 OTUs. Of these, 78 belonged to the phylum Ascomycota, 13 to the phylum Basidiomycota, 1 to the phylum Zygomycota, and 1 to an unknown phylum. Among the OTUs, the most common orders in the Ascomycota were Helotiales (42 OTUs) and Chaetothyriales (14 OTUs) and the most common orders in the Basidiomycota were Sebacinales (3 OTUs) and Platygloeales (3 OTUs). Most OTUs clustered within clades that contained phylotypes identified from samples in Antarctic or Arctic ecosystems or from bryophytes in other ecosystems. In addition, we found that host-related factor may shape the fungal communities associated with bryophytes in this region. This is the first systematic study of the fungal community in Antarctic bryophytes to be performed using culture-independent method and the results may improve understanding of the endophytic fungal evolution and ecology in the Antarctic ecosystem.","Zhang, T; Xiang, HB; Zhang, YQ; Liu, HY; Wei, YZ; Zhao, LX; Yu, LY",EXTREMOPHILES,2013,10.1007/s00792-013-0558-0,0.720072576764367,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.411697009377458,0.588302990622542,0.999987702390457,1.22976095425775e-5,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
2742,Fungal Diversity of Selected Habitat Specific Cynorkis Species (Orchidaceae) in the Central Highlands of Madagascar,"About 90% of Cynorkis species are endemic to the biodiversity hotspot of Madagascar. This terrestrial habitat-specific genus received little study for fungal diversity to support conservation. We evaluated the diversity of culturable fungi of 11 species and soil characteristics from six sites spanning a >40 km radius in and along the region's inselbergs. Peloton-forming fungi were grown in vitro from root/protocorm slices and positively identified using DNA sequencing. The fungal diversity was then correlated with soil pH, NO3-N, P, and K. All species harbored either putative mycorrhizal associates in the Rhizoctonia complex or Hypocreales fungi. Tulasnella Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were most prevalent in all soil types while Serendipita OTUs were found in species inhabiting granite/rock outcrops in moist soil (seepage areas). Most Cynorkis species were present in soil with low NO3-N and P levels with diversity of mycorrhizal fungi inversely correlated to NO3-N levels. Of the different orchid life stages sampled, only one species (Cynorkis fastigiata) yielded putative mycorrhizal fungi from juvenile stages. As diversity of mycorrhizal fungi of Cynorkis spp. was negatively correlated with NO3-N, and majority of the studied taxa were found in soils with low NO3-N and P contents, reintroduction studies must include analysis of N and P in detail. For the first time, we showed that the assemblage of culturable fungi in the roots of habitat-specific species of Cynorkis (Orchidaceae) are intimately tied to specific soil characteristics.","Yokoya, K; Jacob, AS; Zettler, LW; Kendon, JP; Menon, M; Bell, J; Rajaovelona, L; Sarasan, V",MICROORGANISMS,2021,10.3390/microorganisms9040792,0.779560102782205,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993159821721648,0.00684017827835167,0.999979313493742,2.06865062575279e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
1367,Mycorrhiza Reduces Adverse Effects of Dark Septate Endophytes (DSE) on Growth of Conifers,"Mycorrhizal roots are frequently colonized by fungi of the Phialocephala fortinii s.l. - Acephala applanata species complex (PAC). These ascomycetes are common and widespread colonizers of tree roots. Some PAC strains reduce growth increments of their hosts but are beneficial in protecting roots against pathogens. Nothing is known about the effects of PAC on mycorrhizal fungi and the PAC-mycorrhiza association on plant growth, even though these two fungal groups occur closely together in natural habitats. We expect reduced colonization rates and reduced negative effects of PAC on host plants if roots are co-colonized by an ectomycorrhizal fungus (ECM). Depending on the temperature regime interactions among the partners in this tripartite ECM-PAC-plant system might also change. To test our hypotheses, effects of four PAC genotypes (two pathogenic and two non-pathogenic on the Norway spruce), mycorrhization by Laccaria bicolor (strain S238N) and two temperature regimes (19 degrees C and 25 degrees C) on the biomass of the Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) seedlings were studied. Mycorrhization compensated the adverse effects of PAC on the growth of the Norway spruce at both temperatures. The growth of the Douglas-fir was not influenced either by PAC or mycorrhization at 19 degrees C, but at 25 degrees C mycorrhization had a similar protective effect as in the Norway spruce. The compensatory effects probably rely on the reduction of the PAC-colonization density by mycorrhizae. Temperature and the PAC strain only had a differential effect on the biomass of the Norway spruce but not on the Douglas-fir. Higher temperature reduced mycorrhization of both hosts. We conclude that ectomycorrhizae form physical and/or physiological barriers against PAC leading to reduced PAC-colonization of the roots. Additionally, our results indicate that global warming could cause a general decrease of mycorrhization making primary roots more accessible to other symbionts and pathogens.","Reininger, V; Sieber, TN",PLOS ONE,2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0042865,0.735730917931422,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992089036983603,0.00791096301639715,0.99999997083352,2.91664797869018e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

Moreover, both these arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal markers were slightly decreased in the presence ofS. indica.Root ergosterol increased from 7 to 114 mu g g(-1)withS. indicainoculation. With increasing salinity, the concentration of ergosterol in roots decreased. Inoculation withR. irregulariscaused a decrease in root ergosterol. Increasing salinity resulted in an increase of Cl and Na in tomato shoots, but the increase was significantly lower in single- or dual-inoculated plants in contrast to the control plants.","Heidarianpour, MB; Aliasgharzad, N; Olsson, PA",MYCORRHIZA,2020,10.1007/s00572-020-00962-y,0.983023278941046,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.457714661596839,0.542285338403161,0.99999973971353,2.60286470266102e-7,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

Given the lack of effective therapeutic solutions to counteract cancer progression, basic research aims to identify novel bioactive molecules with inhibitory potential on cancer cell migration. In this context, this work investigated the role of members of the salicylaldehyde secondary metabolite set from the sponge endophyte fungus Eurotium chevalieri MUT 2316 as potential inhibitors of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell migration. Since tetrahydroauroglaucin (TAG) and dihydroauroglaucin (DAG) were isolated in large amounts, both were evaluated for their anticancer properties towards SH-SY5Y cells. Both molecules were found to be non-cytotoxic by MTT assay and cytofluorimetric analysis. Moreover, DAG showed efficacy in inhibiting the highly migratory phenotype of SH-SY5Y cells by wound healing assay; whereas TAG, although structurally similar to DAG, showed no anti-migratory effect. Therefore, this work provides good reasons to conduct further in vitro and in vivo studies focusing on DAG as a potentially useful migrastatic natural marine molecule.","Vasarri, M; Vitale, GA; Varese, GC; Barletta, E; D'Auria, MV; de Pascale, D; Degl'Innocenti, D",PHARMACEUTICS,2022,10.3390/pharmaceutics14030616,0.967028157656497,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999405652342458,5.9434765754174e-4,0.999999998595276,1.40472355969479e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6795,Microbial oil accumulation and cellulase secretion of the endophytic fungi from oleaginous plants,"This research was designed to screen for strains that produce microbial oil by using straw as the substrate. One hundred and forty-one isolates of endophytic fungi were obtained from stems of seven oleaginous plant species. Sixty-nine isolates (48.9% of the total isolates) could be clearly seen having lipid bodies in their hyphae when examined with optical microscopy. Twenty-six isolates which had bigger and more oil bodies in their hyphae were selected for further research. These isolates belong to five genera including Microsphaeropsis, Phomopsis, Cephalosporium, Sclerocystis and Nigrospora. Their oil contents ranged from 21.3 to 35.0% of dry cell weights when cultured in potato dextrose broth. When cultured on the solid-state medium composed of steam-exploded wheat straw (20% w/w), wheat bran (5%) and water (75%) they were able to produce cellulase and microbial oil with yields of 0.31 similar to 0.69 filter paper unit and 19 similar to 42 mg/g initial dry substrate, respectively. These results show that some endophytic fungi isolated from the oleaginous plants have the abilities of accumulating oil and producing cellulase simultaneously. They may be potential microbial oil producers by utilising straw as the substrate.","Peng, XW; Chen, HZ",ANNALS OF MICROBIOLOGY,2007,10.1007/BF03175213,0.97622358694969,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.969748604647766,0.0302513953522343,0.999999955964561,4.40354391839648e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

17622,"Endophytes of grapevine flowers, berries, and seeds: identification of cultivable bacteria, comparison with other plant parts, and visualization of niches of colonization.","Endophytic bacteria can colonize various plants and organs. However, endophytes colonizing plant reproductive organs have been rarely analyzed. In this study, endophytes colonizing flowers as well as berries and seeds of grapevine plants grown under natural conditions were investigated by cultivation as well as by fluorescence in situ hybridization. For comparison, bacteria were additionally isolated from other plant parts and the rhizosphere and characterized. Flowers, fruits, and seeds hosted various endophytic bacteria. Some taxa were specifically isolated from plant reproductive organs, whereas others were also detected in the rhizosphere, endorhiza or grape inflo/infructescence stalk at the flowering or berry harvest stage. Microscopic analysis by fluorescence in situ hybridization of resin-embedded samples confirmed the presence of the isolated taxa in plant reproductive organs and enabled us to localize them within the plant. Gammaproteobacteria (including Pseudomonas spp.) and Firmicutes (including Bacillus spp.) were visualized inside the epidermis and xylem of ovary and/or inside flower ovules. Firmicutes, mainly Bacillus spp. were additionally visualized inside berries, in the intercellular spaces of pulp cells and/or xylem of pulp, but also along some cell walls inside parts of seeds.

4111,"Production and bioprocessing of Taxol from Aspergillus niger, an endophyte of Encephalartos whitelockii, with a plausible biosynthetic stability: antiproliferative activity and cell cycle analysis","The biosynthetic potency of Taxol by fungi raises their prospective to be a platform for commercial production of Taxol, nevertheless, the attenuation of its productivity with the fungal storage, is the challenge. Thus, screening for a novel fungal isolate inhabiting ethnopharmacological plants, with a plausible metabolic stability for Taxol production could be one of the most affordable approaches. Aspergillus niger OR414905.1, an endophyte of Encephalartos whitelockii, had the highest Taxol productivity (173.9 mu g/L). The chemical identity of the purified Taxol was confirmed by HPLC, FTIR, and LC-MS/MS analyses, exhibiting the same molecular mass (854.5 m/z) and molecular fragmentation pattern of the authentic Taxol. The purified Taxol exhibited a potent antiproliferative activity against HepG-2, MCF-7 and Caco-2, with IC50 values 0.011, 0.016, and 0.067 mu M, respectively, in addition to a significant activity against A. flavus, as a model of human fungal pathogen. The purified Taxol displayed a significant effect against the cellular migration of HepG-2 and MCF-7 cells, by similar to 52-59% after 72 h, compared to the control, confirming its interference with the cellular matrix formation. Furthermore, the purified Taxol exhibited a significant ability to prompt apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, by about 11-fold compared to control cells, suppressing their division at G2/M phase. Taxol productivity by A. niger has been optimized by the response surface methodology with Plackett-Burman Design and Central Composite Design, resulting in a remarkable similar to 1.6-fold increase (279.8 mu g/L), over the control. The biological half-life time of Taxol productivity by A. niger was similar to 6 months of preservation at 4 degree celsius, however, the Taxol yield by A. niger was partially restored in response to ethyl acetate extracts of E. whitelockii, ensuring the presence of plant-derived signals that triggers the cryptic Taxol encoding genes.","Gamal, A; Fikry, E; Tawfeek, N; El-Shafae, AM; El-Sayed, ASA; El-Domiaty, MM",MICROBIAL CELL FACTORIES,2024,10.1186/s12934-024-02356-7,0.896810809134019,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993909648760203,0.00609035123979722,0.999992573178114,7.42682188625832e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

11833,Biogeography of plant-associated fungal symbionts in mountain ecosystems: A meta-analysis,"Aim: Predicting the potential for climate change to disrupt host-microbe symbioses requires basic knowledge of the biogeography of these consortia. In plants, fungal symbionts can ameliorate the abiotic stressors that accompany climate warming and thus could influence plants under a changing climate. Forecasting future plant-microbe interactions first requires knowledge of current fungal symbiont distributions, which are poorly resolved relative to the distributions of plants. Location: We used meta-analysis to summarize the biogeographic distributions of plant-fungal symbionts in mountain ecosystems worldwide, because these ecosystems are likely to be among the first to experience climate change-induced range shifts. Methods: We analysed 374 records from 53 publications to identify general trends, pinpoint areas in need of greater study and develop reporting guidelines to facilitate future syntheses. Results: Elevational patterns varied strongly among fungal and plant functional groups. Fungal diversity and abundance increased with altitude for the ectomycorrhizal fungi. However, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and localized foliar endophytes declined in either abundance or diversity with altitude. In shrubs, fungal abundance increased with elevation, but in C-3 grasses, fungal abundance declined with elevation. Altitudinal patterns in fungal composition were stronger than gradients in fungal abundance or diversity, suggesting that species turnover contributes more to elevational gradients in fungal symbionts than does variation in abundance or richness. Plant functional groups were overrepresented by C-3 grasses and trees, with surprisingly few data on sedges or shrubs, despite their ecological dominance in mountain ecosystems. Similarly, epichloae, ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and root endophytes were understudied relative to other fungal groups. Main Conclusions: Meta-analysis revealed broad biogeographic patterns in plant-fungal symbiont abundance, diversity and composition that inform predictions of future distributions.","Kivlin, SN; Lynn, JS; Kazenel, MR; Beals, KK; Rudgers, JA",DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS,2017,10.1111/ddi.12595,0.84674170403483,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999995248057279,4.75194272134522e-6,0.999999999995905,4.09516864863235e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
8996,Supression of seed borne Cladosporium herbarum on common bean seed by Trichoderma harzianum and promotion of seedling development,"Trichoderma harzianum isolates have been broadly used for biocontrol of plant diseases caused by fungi. Cladosporium herbarum is a common saprophyte and seed borne fungus, which is easy to manipulate under controlled conditions. It was chosen as a model to test the effectivity of seed treatments with T. harzianum. Common bean seeds (cv. Perola) contaminated with C. herbarum were treated with conidial suspension (CS) and autoclaved filtrate (AF) of five isolates of T. harzianum and subsequently submitted to health and germination tests. The proportion of normal seedlings formed, the length of roots, hypocotyls and leaves, and total plantlet length, total plantlet biomass, root mass ratio (RMR), stem mass ratio (SMR), leaf mass ratio (LMR), aerial part/root system ratio (AP/RS) and leaf area were also evaluated. Isolates CEN289 and CEN290 (CS and AF) provided 66 to 77% of supression of C. herbarum on seeds and a higher number of normal seedlings as compared with control. It also yielded a higher total biomass of plantlets. Moreover treatment with isolates CEN289 and CEN290 increased root and stem length in the experiments with CS. Such results indicate the potential of T. harzianum for seed treatment and suggest that it should be further tested as control for seed borne fungal diseases and as a plant growth promoter. The better performance found for CEN289 and CEN290 confirms the variability in terms of biocontrol activity among strains of T. harzianum.","Guimaraes, GR; Pereira, FS; Matos, FS; Mello, SCM; Carvalho, DDC",TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY,2014,10.1590/S1982-56762014000500007,0.992558489757394,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.974127419560927,0.0258725804390728,0.999999973282536,2.67174642409884e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The underlying mechanism of asperpyridone A was elucidated by analyzing the genes expressed, the Gene Ontology (GO) function enrichment, the protein interaction network, and real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, which suggested that asperpyridone A exhibits hypoglycemic activity by activating the insulin signaling pathway.

1738,Arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis and dark septate endophytes under contrasting grazing modes in the Magellanic steppe of Tierra del Fuego,"The impact of the mode and intensity of sheep grazing on the co-occurrence of AM fungi and DSE in Poa rigidifolia and Deschampsia flexuosa roots and their associations with N and Pin plant tissue was studied in a range of degraded grasslands from Tierra del Fuego (Argentina). Under different grazing modes. AM colonization was always higher in Deschampsia (36.8%) than in Poa (24.5%), whereas DSE colonization was similar in both species (28% in Deschampsia and 27% in Poa). High DSE colonization was associated with soils of low fertility and subjected to grazing associated with an intense grassland disturbance. In contrast, AM colonization was associated with more fertile soils and low grassland disturbance. An opposite response of AM and DSE colonization was observed in low or absence of grazing. Nutrients in the plant tissue were always higher in Deschampsia than in Poa. Nitrogen concentration in both plants was positively correlated with AM and negatively with DSE colonization, whereas P concentration showed no correlation with AM or DSE. The highest AM colonization indexes and nutrients in tissue may explain why Deschampsia is much better adapted to the acid, xeric conditions and low fertility of the soils of these grasslands than Poa.

17446,First Report of Brown Rot Caused by Monilia polystroma on Apple in Serbia.,"Monilia polystroma van Leeuwen is a new Japanese species, similar to M. fructigena but distinguishable based on morphological and molecular characteristics (3). After its first discovery on apple in Japan, occurance of M. polystroma in Europe has been reported in Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Switzerland (2,3,4). In October 2011, during a survey for apple fungal pathogens in the Bela Crkva district, 15 apple fruit (Malus domestica Borkh.) cv. Golden Delicious were collected. Two isolates of Monilinia polystroma were obtained from apple fruit showing brown rot, covered with small yellowish sporodohia. The pathogen was identified as M. polystroma based on morphological and molecular features (1,3). Upon isolation, colonies cultivated on PDA were white to grayish and the mycelium grew 8.85 mm per day at 22 ± 1°C in 12-h light/12-h dark regime. After 6 to 8 days of incubation, black stromatal plates were observed on the reverse sides of the inoculated petri dishes. Conidia were one-celled, limoniform, hyaline, 14.7 to 21.88 μm (16.2 mean) × 7.85 to 12.92 μm (10.8 mean), and were produced in branched monilioid chains on inoculated apple fruit. Morphological identification was confirmed by PCR (1) using genomic DNA extracted from the mycelium of pure cultures, and amplified products of 425 bp in length, specific for M. polystroma were amplified as expected with primers MO368-5 and MO368-8R. For one isolate, the ribosomal ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region was obtained, using primers ITS1 and ITS4, and deposited in GenBank (Accession No JX315717). The sequence was 498 bp in length and showed 100% identity with sequences deposited for M. polystroma in NCBI GenBank (JN128835, AM937114, GU067539). Pathogenicity was confirmed by wound-inoculating five surface-sterilized, mature apple fruit with mycelium plugs (5 mm in diameter) of both isolates grown on PDA. Control fruit were inoculated with sterile PDA plugs. After 3 days of incubation in plastic containers, under high humidity (RH 90 to 95%) at 22 ± 1°C, typical symptoms of brown rot developed on inoculated fruit, while control fruit remained symptomless. Isolates recovered from symptomatic fruit showed the same morphological and molecular characteristics as original isolates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of M. polystroma in Serbia. Further studies are necessary to estimate the economic importance and geographic distribution of this organism in Serbia. References: (1) M.-J. Côté et al. Plant Dis. 88:1219, 2004. (2) M.

15851,"The diversity and distribution of endophytes across biomes, plant phylogeny and host tissues: how far have we come and where do we go from here?","The interiors of plants are colonized by diverse microorganisms that are referred to as endophytes. Endophytes have received much attention over the past few decades, yet many questions remain unanswered regarding patterns in their biodiversity at local to global scales. To characterize research effort to date, we synthesized results from ~600 published studies. Our survey revealed a global research interest and highlighted several gaps in knowledge. For instance, of the 17 biomes encompassed by our survey, 7 were understudied and together composed only 7% of the studies that we considered. We found that fungal endophyte diversity has been characterized in at least one host from 30% of embryophyte families, while bacterial endophytes have been surveyed in hosts from only 10.5% of families. We complimented our survey with a vote counting procedure to determine endophyte richness patterns among plant tissue types. We found that variation in endophyte assemblages in above-ground tissues varied with host growth habit. Stems were the richest tissue in woody plants, whereas roots were the richest tissue in graminoids. For forbs, we found no consistent differences in relative tissue richness among studies. We propose future directions to fill the gaps in knowledge we uncovered and inspire further research. © 2020 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Harrison J.G.; Griffin E.A.,Environmental Microbiology,2020,10.1111/1462-2920.14968,0.955551844152037,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.94047807735217,0.0595219226478295,0.999997248673166,2.75132683402735e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2624,Phylogenetic Diversity and Host Specialization of Corynespora cassiicola Responsible for Emerging Target Spot Disease of Cotton and Other Crops in the Southeastern United States,"Corynespora cassiicola is a ubiquitous fungus causing emerging plant diseases worldwide, including target spot of cotton, soybean, and tomato, which have rapidly increased in incidence and severity throughout the southeastern United States. The objectives of this study were to understand the causes for the emerging target spot epidemics in the United States by comparing phylogenetic relationships of isolates from cotton, tomato, soybean, and other crop plants and ornamental hosts, and through the determination of the host range of isolates from emerging populations. Fifty-three isolates were sampled from plants in the southeastern United States and 1,380 nucleotides from four nuclear loci were sequenced. Additionally, sequences of the same loci from 23 isolates representing each of the distinct lineages of C. cassiicola described from previous studies were included. Isolates clustered based on host of origin, regardless of the geographic location of sampling. There was no genetic diversity detected among isolates from cotton, which were genetically distinct from isolates from other host species. Furthermore, pathogenicity and virulence assays of 40 isolates from various hosts onto cotton, soybean, tomato, and cucumber showed that isolates from cotton were more aggressive to cotton than those from other hosts. Soybean and tomato were most susceptible to isolates that originated from the same host, providing evidence of host specialization. These results suggest that emerging target spot epidemics in the United States are caused by either the introduction of host-specific isolates or the evolution of more aggressive strains on each host.","Sumabat, LG; Kemerait, RC; Brewer, MT",PHYTOPATHOLOGY,2018,10.1094/PHYTO-12-17-0407-R,0.986270714235392,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999883213931012,1.1678606898763e-4,0.999999997165854,2.8341464730630204e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

RESULTS There were 16 151 differential genes including 14 706 up-regulated and 1445 down-regulated unigenes with significant differences (P < 0.05), and a total of 1432 metabolites exhibited statistically significant (P < 0.05) metabolic differences comprising 27 different marker metabolites which showed highly significant values of VIP > 5 and P < 0.01. Results highlight differential regulation of 20 enzymatic genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of five different marker metabolites including acetaldehyde, homocysteine, cyclopropylamine, 1-pyrrolinium and halistanol sulfate.

2815,Effect of an Epichloe endophyte on adaptability to water stress in Festuca sinensis,"As water stress, including drought and waterlogging, can severely affect plant growth, this study investigated the effects of an endophyte from the genus Epichloe on two different ecotypes of Festuca sinensis grass under five soil water conditions in a controlled greenhouse experiment. Changes in F. sinensis plants grown with (E+) and without the endophyte (E-) were evaluated as they were subjected to different water treatments (20%, 35%, 50%, 65% and 80% relative saturation moisture content, RSMC). Growth parameters such as plant height, number of tillers, blade width, stem diameter, root length, total biomass, root-shoot ratio and relative water content were determined. The results showed that drought and waterlogging significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited the growth of F. sinensis. The presence of the endophyte significantly (P < 0.05) increased plant growth and root-shoot ratio under drought and waterlogged conditions. In addition, the plant height, number of tillers, blade width, stem diameter and total biomass in seedlings of both ecotypes reached the maximum at 65% RSMC, which suggests the optimal water condition. These findings also show that moderate drought (35% and 50% RSMC) could promote root growth of grass seedlings. Therefore, endophytic infections can result in enhanced host plant resistance to drought and waterlogged conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

16057,"Isolation, identification, and salt tolerance characterization of a salt-tolerant and plant growth-promoting fungal strain Ophioceras leptosporum LW2","[Objective] Soil salinization is a serious threat to land health, and microbial remediation of saline-alkali soil is an eco-friendly and practical approach. Endophytic fungi can enhance host resistance to both biotic and abiotic stresses. Consequently, there is a need for further research on the biological characteristics of endophytic fungi. Such research can expand the existing endophytic fungal database and provide elite strains and effective strategies for the green remediation of saline-alkali soil and soil restoration. [Methods] The characteristics of the fungal strain were analyzed by plate culture under stress, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and multi-gene phylogenetic analysis. The colonization of the strain in rice roots was examined by GFP fluorescence labeling, trypan blue staining, SEM, and colonization curve plotting. Pot experiments under stress and non-stress conditions, the peroxidase activity assay, transcriptome analysis, and gene expression analysis were carried out to decipher the mechanism by which the strain enhanced the salt tolerance of rice plants. [Results] An endophytic fungal strain, LW2, capable of enhancing the salt tolerance of host rice plants, was obtained. The phylogenetic tree showed that LW2 clustered with Ophioceras leptosporum CBS 894.70 in the same minimal clade, and thus the strain was identified as O. leptosporum LW2. LW2 successfully colonized rice roots and promoted the growth of potted rice. The rice plants co-cultured with LW2 showed significant increases in the fresh weight, plant height, and stem width. The pot experiments under salt stress showed that LW2 improved the salt tolerance of rice by increasing the plant height and stem width under stress conditions while alleviating stress-induced wilting and yellowing. LW2 mitigated salt-induced damage of rice by increasing the peroxidase activity and promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging. In addition, LW2 regulated the expression of EIL1 and HKTs in the ethylene signaling pathway which affected ion transport, thereby enhancing rice salt tolerance. [Conclusion] This study identified an endophytic fungal strain, O. leptosporum LW2, capable of enhancing the salt tolerance of host rice. We preliminarily investigate the salt tolerance mechanism of this strain, providing scientific evidence and an elite strain for microbial remediation of saline-alkaline soil and the development of green agriculture. © 2025, Acta Microbiologica Sinica Editorial Office.

21314,"Antibacterial activity of nano chitosan derived from mangrove fungus endophyte, Fusarium sp. 20CB07","This study aimed to evaluate antibactereal activity and characterize nano chitosan obtained from mangrove fungal endophytes, exploiting the chitin components in fungal cell walls. Four fungal isolates were collected from various parts of mangrove plants. Chitosan extraction from fungi involved a 14-day solid-state fermentation process in rice media, followed by deacetylation. The resulting chitosan extract underwent characterization through infrared spectroscopy to determine the degree of deacetylation and differential scanning calorimeter analysis to characterize chitosan. Nano chitosan synthesis used the ionic gelation method with sodium tripolyphosphate. The particle size of nano chitosan was analyzed using a particle size analyzer, and its antibacterial bioactivity was tested against clinically resistant bacterial pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Among the four isolates, isolate 20CB07, identified as Fusarium sp., demonstrated superior chitosan production. This isolate yielded chitosan with a percentage yield of 16.7% and a deacetylation degree of 97.77%. The differential scanning calorimeter analysis of chitosan exhibited a thermogram with broad endothermic peaks around 72.9oC and between 278.6 and 314o C due to the decomposition of water and chitosan, respectively. Nano chitosan characterization revealed a nanoparticle size of 127.2 nm. The compound demonstrates antibacterial activity against both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at a concentration level of 50 μg mL-1, exhibiting greater selectivity towards inhibiting P. aeruginosa over S. aureus. These findings highlight the potential of isolate 20CB07 as a chitosan source, providing foundational information for future studies on the bioactivity applications of nano chitosan. © 2024, BIOFLUX SRL.

19528,Enumeration of citrus endophytic bacterial communities based on illumine metagenomics technique.,"Citrus is a valuable crop in Pakistan. It is rich in vitamin C, other nutrients and antioxidants. Huanglongbing (HLB) caused by a bacterium ""Candidatus liberibacter asiaticus"" (CLas), africanus and americanus has an influence on citrus production around the world. Beside HLB there exist several other bacterial species in citrus groves in Pakistan. The structure and diversity of bacterial species in various ecosystems can be quickly examined using NGS. This approach is considerably quicker and more precise than outdated methods. Healthy or citrus greening infected leaf samples of Grapefruit (Citrus paradisi), C. aurantifolia, and C. reticulata Blanco were used for diversity analysis. In this study high throughput, NGS technique was used to access the population of both cultivable and non-cultivable bacterial endophytes from citrus leaves, by using PCR amplicons of 16S rDNA sequences (V5-V7 regions) with Illumina Hi seq. As a result, a total number of 68,722 sequences were produced from the test samples. According to the NGS-based diversity classification, the most common genera of exploited bacterial endophytes were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteria. C. aurantifolia and C. paradisi showed almost equal diversity, whereas C. reticulata Blanco had a higher proportion of Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria in their leaves. To determine alpha diversity (AD), additional data was analyzed using statistical indices such as Shannon, Chao1, and Simpson. According to the inverse Simpson diversity index, the abundance of the microbial population in six different citrus samples was 0.48, 0.567, and 0.163, respectively. The metagenomics of microbiota in plant tissues was successfully recorded by NGS technology, which can help us learn more about the interactions between plants and microbes.

Piriformospora indica has been reported to be successful in managing many RNA viruses and single-stranded DNA viruses infecting various crops. In this study, the efficiency of Piriformospora indica was evaluated in managing Pipper yellow mottle virus (PYMoV), which is a double stranded DNA virus infecting black pepper. Piriformospora indica-colonization significantly reduced the incidence and severity of PYMoV in black pepper. Loss in biomass caused due to the virus infection was also significantly lower in the P. indica-colonized plants compared to the control plants. PCR analysis revealed that the virus titer was less in the colonized plants than in the control plants; thus inhibiting the replication of the virus. © 2022, Kerala Agricultural University.

18513,Essential Genes for In Vitro Growth of the Endophyte Herbaspirillum seropedicae SmR1 as Revealed by Transposon Insertion Site Sequencing.,"The interior of plants contains microorganisms (referred to as endophytes) that are distinct from those present at the root surface or in the surrounding soil. Herbaspirillum seropedicae strain SmR1, belonging to the betaproteobacteria, is an endophyte that colonizes crops, including rice, maize, sugarcane, and sorghum. Different approaches have revealed genes and pathways regulated during the interactions of H. seropedicae with its plant hosts. However, functional genomic analysis of transposon (Tn) mutants has been hampered by the lack of genetic tools. Here we successfully employed a combination of in vivo high-density mariner Tn mutagenesis and targeted Tn insertion site sequencing (Tn-seq) in H. seropedicae SmR1. The analysis of multiple gene-saturating Tn libraries revealed that 395 genes are essential for the growth of H. seropedicae SmR1 in tryptone-yeast extract medium. A comparative analysis with the Database of Essential Genes (DEG) showed that 25 genes are uniquely essential in H. seropedicae SmR1. The Tn mutagenesis protocol developed and the gene-saturating Tn libraries generated will facilitate elucidation of the genetic mechanisms of the H. seropedicae endophytic lifestyle. A focal point in the study of endophytes is the development of effective biofertilizers that could help to reduce the input of agrochemicals in croplands. Besides the ability to promote plant growth, a good biofertilizer should be successful in colonizing its host and competing against the native microbiota. By using a systematic Tn-based gene-inactivation strategy and massively parallel sequencing of Tn insertion sites (Tn-seq), it is possible to study the fitness of thousands of Tn mutants in a single experiment. We have applied the combination of these techniques to the plant-growth-promoting endophyte Herbaspirillum seropedicae SmR1. The Tn mutant libraries generated will enable studies into the genetic mechanisms of H. seropedicae-plant interactions. The approach that we have taken is applicable to other plant-interacting bacteria.",Rosconi F; de Vries SP; Baig A; Fabiano E; Grant AJ,Applied and environmental microbiology,2016,10.1128/AEM.02281-16,0.956417868327939,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997879305608543,0.00212069439145686,0.999999995318354,4.681645515702831e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

In laboratory tests, N.similar to gansuense infections of A.similar to inebrians increased mortality rates and reduced the survival of an aphid Rhopalosiphum padi and a mite Tetranychus cinnabarinus. Both species demonstrated a quantitative preference for feeding on endophyte-free (E-) compared with endophyte-infected (E+) leaves. In the field, populations of the two species were lower on E+ compared with E- specimens for most of the growing season. Results of tests with a grasshopper species (Oedaleus decorus) gave similar results. A species of seed-harvesting ant (Messor aciculatus) showed a preference for collecting E- seeds. These results demonstrate that the anti-herbivore activity of E+ A.similar to inebrians is effective against a wide range of arthropod groups. Thus, the Neotyphodium endophyte may help this grass to improve its invasive ability and, therefore, broaden its range.","Zhang, XX; Li, CJ; Nan, ZB; Matthew, C",WEED RESEARCH,2012,10.1111/j.1365-3180.2011.00887.x,0.968583647955789,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999939230760147,6.07692398530733e-5,0.999999999999299,7.01438906958174e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

18687,Endophyte-enriched biochar and zeolite for heavy metal immobilization in sewage-irrigated soils: impacts on Spinacia oleracea growth and antioxidant responses.,"Untreated sewage water (SW) irrigation in farmlands leads to the accumulation of toxic metals in soils, which can cause serious concerns for food safety and global food security. This study evaluated the effectiveness of endophytic enriched biochar (EBC) and endophytic enriched zeolite (EZE) as immobilizing agents to reduce heavy metal uptake in Spinacea oleracea (S. oleracea) irrigated with SW. In a pot experiment, EBC and EZE were applied at rate of 1% w/w with control treatment. The experiment was arranged in completely randomized design with three replicates. Results showed that SW negatively affected spinach growth and physiology. However, applying EBC and EZE, alone or in combination, considerably improved growth and physiology by reducing cadmium (Cd) and chromium (Cr) uptake. Interestingly, combining EBC and EZE with tap water (TW) and SW increased shoot and root dry weights by 80.58% and 71.83%, reducing Cd and Cr uptake in shoots by 93% and 75%, respectively, compared to the control. Additionally, this combination significantly decreased antioxidant enzyme activity, particularly Ascorbate peroxidase (APX, 59.4%), Catalase (CAT, 42.3%), Glutathione peroxidase (GPX, 68%). The co-application of EBC and EZE under TW+SW (1:1) enhanced phyto-stabilization efficiency significantly and minimized health risks from spinach consumption. The improvement in plant growth with EBC and EZE under Cd and Cr stress suggests that both amendments could be efficient for promoting the Cd and Cr immobilization and improving the soil quality in Cd and Cr-contaminated soil. This emphasizes their capacity as sustainable soil enhancer for the remediation of Cd and Cr-contaminated soils, promotion of healthy plant biomass and support the prolonged ecological restoration. This study demonstrates the synergistic potential of endophyte-enriched biochar (EBC) and zeolite (EZE) in mitigating cadmium and chromium uptake in Spinacea oleracea grown under sewage water irrigation.

15444,The Long-Term Resistance to Carbendazim in Venturia inaquealis in the Krasnodar Region (Russia),"Regular application of systemic fungicides to control apple scab in vulnerable types results in the selection of resistant strains. Benzimidazoles were one of the first fungicides to which Venturia inaequalis developed resistance. This class of fungicides has been prohibited for use on apple trees in the Russian Federation since 2015. This is due to their low efficacy. It seems relevant to assess the sensitivity of the pathogen to benzimidazoles after a long break in use. The sensitivity to carbendazim of four populations of the causative agent of apple scab, V. inaequalis, from Krasnodar Territory, Russia, was studied. The baseline population had never been exposed to the effects of a fungicide. It was collected in natural growths of the eastern apple tree (Malus orientalis) in the Western Cauca-sus foothills. The other populations of pathogen were collected from commercial orchards of M. × domestica cul-tivars “Rienette Simirenko”, “Gala”, and “Jeromine”, where it was once used fungicidal treatments with car-bendazim. Sampling was carried out in 2020–2021. In total, the sensitivity of 227 monospore isolates was stud-ied. In experiments in vitro, we determined an effective 50% dose (ED50 or EC50) of monospore cultures of the pathogen, a dose at which there is a double decrease in mycelium growth when using five to six concentrations of carbendazim (Zimoshans 500 CE, manufacturer: OOO “Chance”, Russia). For the baseline population, the concentrations of carbendazim were 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 mg/l; for the garden population, they were 10, 50, 100, 500, 1000, and 10000 mg/l of the active substance. ED50 was determined using probit regression analysis. The original population of Venturia inaequalis showed its high sensitivity to carbendazim. The distribution of these isolates was characterized by a logonormal dependence; most of the isolates were sensitive to low concentrations of the fungicide. The mean EC50 value was 0.0102 mg/l active ingredient, with a difference between the extreme values of this indicator of 30.8. The EC50 value of carbendazim for the initial population of apple scab from the Krasnodar region was obtained for the first time in this study. All studied horticultural populations (more than 170 isolates) were resistant to carbendazim. EC50 values for most of the isolates could not be accu-rately calculated, as even the highest drug concentrations of 10 000 mg/l used did not result in significant growth inhibition. For the first time in the region, long-term resistance (for six years) of the apple scab pathogen to car-bendazim was shown. © 2022, Russian Academy of Sciences.

We demonstrate that approximately 75% of the genes, which respond to P. indica in Arabidopsis roots, differ among seedlings grown on normal phosphate (Pi) or Pi limitation conditions, and among wild-type and the wrky6 mutant impaired in the regulation of the Pi metabolism. Mapman analyses suggest that the fungus activates different signaling, transport, metabolic and developmental programs in the roots of wild-type and wrky6 seedlings under normal and low Pi conditions. Under low Pi, P. indica promotes growth and Pi uptake of wild-type seedlings, and the stimulatory effects are identical for mutants impaired in the PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTERS1; 1, -1; 2 and -1; 4. The data suggest that the fungus does not stimulate Pi uptake, but adapts the expression profiles to Pi limitation in Pi metabolism mutants.","Bakshi, M; Sherameti, I; Meichsner, D; Thürich, J; Varma, A; Johri, AK; Yeh, KW; Oelmüller, R",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2017,10.3389/fmicb.2017.01262,0.99319178143307,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.917456047071378,0.0825439529286224,0.999998961980131,1.03801986917063e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

3374,Plant population and genotype effects override the effects of Epichloe endophyte species on growth and drought stress response of Achnatherum robustum plants in two natural grass populations,"In cool-season grasses, systemic and vertically transmitted EpichloA infections often provide a suite of benefits including increased growth, reproduction and competitive abilities. However, these effects of EpichloA endophytes on their hosts often depend upon host and endophyte genotype and environmental factors. Achnatherum robustum (sleepygrass) harbors at least two EpichloA species within natural populations in the Southwest USA. We tested the effects of endophyte infection and species, host population and plant genotype (by experimentally removing the endophyte), and soil moisture (a key limiting factor) on growth and drought stress response of infected A. robustum plants from two populations (Weed and Cloudcroft) in the Sacremento Mountains of New Mexico, USA). Although the two populations harbor distinct EpichloA species each with very different chemoprofiles, neither endophyte status (infected vs. uninfected) nor endophyte species affected most growth parameters at 8 or 25 weeks of the experiment, except for leaf length. In high water treatment, infected plants from the Weed population had longer leaf length compared with uninfected plants. In contrast, the population of origin affected all growth parameters, including plant height, leaf number, length and width, tiller number and shoot and root biomass, as well as wilting time. Grasses from the Cloudcroft population generally showed greater growth than grasses from the Weed population. Endophyte infection did affect wilting time, with infection in the Weed population generally reducing time to wilting under low and high water, whereas infection in the Cloudcroft population reduced time to wilting only under high water conditions. Our results suggest that plant population and their associated plant genotypes may play a much larger role in endophyte-host grass interactions in varying environments than previously thought. Asexual EpichloA species may be compatible with only specific host genotypes within populations such that the phenotypic effects due to population may be greater than phenotypic changes influenced by variation in the endophyte.","Jia, T; Shymanovich, T; Gao, YB; Faeth, SH",JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY,2015,10.1093/jpe/rtv004,0.787039709724617,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99890601593447,0.00109398406552973,0.999368096709723,6.319032902774e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

15685,Effect of light exposure on secondary metabolites production of an endophytic fungus arthrinium rasikravindrae and its antioxidant and anticancer activities,"Endophytic microorganisms are one of the promising sources in producing bioactive compounds, to be developed for new drug candidates. They are found to have the ability to generate the same compounds as their host plant. Metabolite producing capacity of the endophytes is known to be affected by light exposure during fermentation process. This study focused on an endophytic fungus Arthrinium rasikravindrae isolated from Coleus amboinicus stem to reveal out its metabolite profiles due to light exposure as well as its bioactivity consequences. A. rasikravindrae was cultured on potato dextrose broth medium for 14 days and fermented in dark and exposed to natural light. Metabolite profiling was performed using TLC and GC-MS analysis. The activities were observed using DPPH assay for antioxidant and MTT assay for cytotoxicity potential. The results showed that A. rasikravindrae ethyl acetate extract produced during dark and exposed to light fermentation conditions contained different compounds but there was some which showed similarity with their host plant. Methyl octadec-9-enoate was found in all fermentation conditions as well as in C. amboinicus stem extract. Besides methyl octadec-9-enoate, methyl palmitate was also found present in both A. rasikravindrae extract fermented exposed to light and its host plant. The antioxidant activity of extract generated from dark fermentation condition was better as compared to that exposed to light with IC50 value of 66.36±0.53 vs 556.92±34.37 µg/mL. However, cytotoxic activity screening against several cancer cell lines exhibited opposing results in which extract from light-exposed fermentation resulted in better cytotoxic activity (IC50 value of 291.40 ± 2.34 µg/mL on WiDr, 336.80 ± 5.05 µg/mL on T47D, and 404.73 ± 3.46 µg/mL on Hela cell lines). Extract obtained from dark fermentation condition showed IC50 value of more than 500 µg/mL in all tested cancer cell lines. Preliminary examination on cytotoxic activity against WiDR cells suggested that the extract from light-exposed fermentation might induce cell death through mechanisms involving cell cycle arrest. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

19360,The Endophytic Root Microbiome Is Different in Healthy and Ralstonia solanacearum-Infected Plants and Is Regulated by a Consortium Containing Beneficial Endophytic Bacteria.,"Plant bacterial wilt disease caused by Ralstonia solanacearum leads to huge economic losses worldwide. Endophytes play vital roles in promoting plant growth and health. It is hypothesized that the endophytic root microbiome and network structure are different in healthy and diseased plants. Here, the endophytic root microbiomes and network structures of healthy and diseased tobacco plants were investigated. Composition and network structures of endophytic root microbiomes were distinct between healthy and diseased plants. Healthy plants were enriched with more beneficial bacteria and bacteria with antagonistic activity against R. solanacearum. R. solanacearum was most abundant in diseased plants. Microbial networks in diseased plants had fewer modules and edges, lower connectivity, and fewer keystone microorganisms than those in healthy plants. Almost half of the nodes were unique in the two networks. Ralstonia was identified as a key microorganism of the diseased-plant network. In healthy plants, abundant bacteria and biomarkers (Pseudomonas and Streptomyces) and keystone microorganisms (Bacillus, Lysobacter, and Paenibacillus) were plant-beneficial bacteria and showed antibacterial and plant growth-promoting activities. The endophytic strain Bacillus velezensis E9 produced bacillaene to inhibit R. solanacearum. Consortia containing keystone microorganisms and beneficial endophytic bacteria significantly regulated the endophytic microbiome and attenuated bacterial wilt by inducing systemic resistance and producing antibiotic. Overall, the endophytic root microbiome and network structure in diseased plants were different from those in healthy plants. The endophytic root microbiome of diseased plants had low abundances of beneficial bacteria and an unstable network and lacked beneficial keystone microorganisms, which favored infection. Synthetic microbial consortia were effective measures for preventing R. solanacearum infection. IMPORTANCE Bacterial wilt disease causes heavy yield losses in many crops. Endophytic microbiomes play important roles in control of plant diseases. However, the role of the endophytic root microbiome in controlling bacterial wilt disease is poorly understood. Here, differences in endophytic root microbiomes and network structures between healthy and diseased tobacco plants are reported. A synthetic microbial consortium containing beneficial endophytic bacteria was used to regulate the endophytic microbiome and attenuate bacterial wilt disease. The results could be generally used to guide control of bacterial wilt disease.",Li Y; Qi G; Xie Z; Li B; Wang R; Tan J; Shi H; Xiang B; Zhao X,Microbiology spectrum,2023,10.1128/spectrum.02031-22,0.980471566317323,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.463821428005397,0.536178571994603,0.99855113360783,0.00144886639216979,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

12598,Analysis of growth dynamics in five different media and metabolic phenotypic characteristics of Piriformospora indica,"Piriformospora indica is an important endophytic fungus with broad potential for alleviating biotic and abiotic stress on host plants. This study monitored the growth dynamics of P. indica on five commonly used artificial media for microorganisms and analyzed its metabolic characteristics using Biolog Phenotype Microarray (PM) technology. The results showed that P. indica grew fastest on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA), followed by Kidney Bean Agar (KBA), Alkyl Ester Agar (AEA), Oatmeal Agar (OA), and Luria-Bertani Agar (LB), and the most suitable medium for spore production was OA. Using Biolog PM1-10, 950 metabolic phenotypes of P. indica were obtained. P. indica could metabolize 87.89% of the tested carbon sources, 87.63% of the tested nitrogen sources, 96.61% of the tested phosphorus sources, and 100% of the tested sulfur sources. P. indica displayed 92 kinds of tested biosynthetic pathways, and it could grow under 92 kinds of tested osmotic pressures and 88 kinds of tested pH conditions. PM plates 1-2 revealed 43 efficient carbon sources, including M-Hydroxyphenyl acid, N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine, Tyramine, Maltotrios, alpha-D-Glucosine, I-Erythritol, L-Valine, D-Melezitose, D-Tagatose, and Turanose. PM plates 3,6-8 indicated 170 efficient nitrogen sources, including Adenosine, Inosine Allantoin, D, L-Lactamide, Arg-Met, lle-Trp, Ala-Arg, Thr-Arg, Trp-Tyr, Val-Asn, Gly-Gly-D-Leu, Gly-Gly-Phe, and Leu-Leu-Leu. This study demonstrates that P. indica can metabolize a variety of substrates, such as carbon and nitrogen sources, and has a wide range of environmental adaptability. The growth dynamics on artificial culture media and metabolic phenotypes of P. indica can be used to investigate its biological characteristics, screen for more suitable growth and sporulation conditions, and elucidate the physiological mechanisms that enhance the stress resistance of host plants. This study provides a theoretical basis for its better application in agriculture.","Hu, JR; Li, JM; Wang, HY; Sun, ML; Huang, CY; Wang, HC",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2024,10.3389/fmicb.2023.1301743,0.913876413299729,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.851841516035748,0.148158483964252,0.999993827959403,6.17204059660814e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

The limited selection of studies quoted here exemplifies the range of host responses to symbiotic DSE fungi. Like mycorrhizal associations, DSE associations vary from negative to neutral and positive when measured by host performance or host tissue nutrient concentrations. This range of host responses is partially attributable to variation between different fungus taxa and strains. Similarly, hosts differ in their responses to a single DSE strain. Experimental conditions may also govern the nature of the symbiotic association. It is concluded that DSE are capable of forming mutualistic associations functionally similar to mycorrhizas. If the variation in host response to mycorrhizal fungi is considered to represent a continuum ranging from parasitism to mutualism, DSE symbiosis must be considered mycorrhizal, at least under some conditions.",Jumpponen A.,Mycorrhiza,2001,10.1007/s005720100112,0.970372274016676,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.953133734664009,0.0468662653359913,0.999998891502728,1.10849727230633e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

19331,Endophytes as nature's gift to plants to combat abiotic stresses.,"In recent decades, scientists have recognized that plants' distinct and immensely dynamic microbial communities are more than just ""passengers,"" but instead, play an important role in their development, and shielding against abiotic and biotic stresses. Endophytes comprise fungi and bacteria that live within plant tissues and support growth when plants are under stress. All plants in nature are considered to have symbiotic association with endophytes. A comprehensive review of the accessible data suggests that mobility, cell-wall degradation capacity, and reactive oxygen species scavenging are critical attributes for the successful colonization of endophytes. Plants encounter several abiotic stresses caused by climate change and global warming, which have an effect on their growth and production. Abiotic stress like high temperature, salinity, and high precipitation can severely affect plants compared to biotic stress. This review aims to highlight what role endophytes play to aid plant growth under abiotic stress conditions like heat, salinity, and drought.

18668,Genomic and Metabolomic Analysis of the Endophytic Fungus Alternaria alstroemeriae S6 Isolated from Veronica acinifolia: Identification of Anti-Bacterial Properties and Production of Succinic Acid.,"Background: Endophytic fungi are prolific sources of bioactive metabolites with potential in pharmaceutical and biotechnological applications. Methods: Here, the endophytic fungus, Alternaria alstroemeriae S6, was isolated from Veronica acinifolia (speedwell), and conducted its anti-microbial activities, whole-genome sequencing and metabolome analysis. Results: The ethyl acetate extract of this fungus exhibited strong anti-bacterial activity and the inhibition zones, induced by the fungal extract at 20 mg/mL, reached 16.25 ± 0.5 mm and 26.5 ± 0.5 mm against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. To unravel the biosynthetic potential for anti-bacterial compounds, whole-genome sequencing was conducted on A. alstroemeriae S6, resulting in a high-quality assembly of 42.93 Mb encoding 13,885 protein-coding genes. Comprehensive functional genome annotation analyses, including gene ontology (GO) terms, clusters of orthologous groups (COGs), Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), and antibiotics and secondary metabolites analysis shell (antiSMASH) analyses, were performed. According to the antiSMASH analysis, 58 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), including 16 non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs), 21 terpene synthases, 12 polyketide synthetases (PKSs), and 9 hybrids, were identified. In addition, succinic acid was identified as the major metabolite within the fungal extract, while 20 minor bioactive compounds were identified through LC-MS/MS-based molecular networking on a GNPS database.

12420,ITS1 metabarcoding highlights low specificity of lichen mycobiomes at a local scale,"As self-supporting and long-living symbiotic structures, lichens provide a habitat for many other organisms beside the traditionally considered lichen symbionts - the myco- and the photobionts. The lichen-inhabiting fungi either develop diagnostic phenotypes or occur asymptomatically. Because the degree of specificity towards the lichen host is poorly known, we studied the diversity of these fungi among neighbouring lichens on rocks in an alpine habitat. Using a sequencing metabarcoding approach, we show that lichen mycobiomes clearly reflect the overlap of multiple ecological sets of taxa, which differ in their trophic association with lichen thalli. The lack of specificity to the lichen mycobiome is further supported by the lack of community structure observed using clustering and ordination methods. The communities encountered across samples largely result from the subsampling of a shared species pool, in which we identify three major ecological components: (i) a generalist environmental pool, (ii) a lichenicolous/endolichenic pool and (iii) a pool of transient species. These taxa majorly belong to the fungal classes Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and Tremellomycetes with close relatives in adjacent ecological niches. We found no significant evidence that the phenotypically recognized lichenicolous fungi influence the occurrence of the other asymptomatic fungi in the host thalli. We claim that lichens work as suboptimal habitats or as a complex spore and mycelium bank, which modulate and allow the regeneration of local fungal communities. By performing an approach that minimizes ambiguities in the taxonomic assignments of fungi, we present how lichen mycobiomes are also suitable targets for improving bioinformatic analyses of fungal metabarcoding.","Fernández-Mendoza, F; Fleischhacker, A; Kopun, T; Grube, M; Muggia, L",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2017,10.1111/mec.14244,0.988946473714703,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.776465882490121,0.223534117509879,0.999996326315735,3.67368426545944e-6,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
3724,Levels of specificity of Xylaria species associated with fungus-growing termites: a phylogenetic approach,"Fungus-growing termites live in obligate mutualistic symbiosis with species of the basidiomycete genus Termitomyces, which are cultivated on a substrate of dead plant material. When the termite colony dies, or when nest material is incubated without termites in the laboratory, fruiting bodies of the ascomycete genus Xylaria appear and rapidly cover the fungus garden. This raises the question whether certain Xylaria species are specialised in occupying termite nests or whether they are just occasional visitors. We tested Xylaria specificity at four levels: (1) fungus-growing termites, (2) termite genera, (3) termite species, and (4) colonies. In South Africa, 108 colonies of eight termite species from three termite genera were sampled for Xylaria. Xylaria was isolated from 69% of the sampled nests and from 57% of the incubated fungus comb samples, confirming high prevalence. Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS region revealed 16 operational taxonomic units of Xylaria, indicating high levels of Xylaria species richness. Not much of this variation was explained by termite genus, species, or colony; thus, at level 2-4 the specificity is low. Analysis of the large subunit rDNA region, showed that all termite-associated Xylaria belong to a single clade, together with only three of the 26 non-termite-associated strains. Termite-associated Xylaria thus show specificity for fungus-growing termites (level 1). We did not find evidence for geographic or temporal structuring in these Xylaria phylogenies. Based on our results, we conclude that termite-associated Xylaria are specific for fungus-growing termites, without having specificity for lower taxonomic levels.","Visser, AA; Ros, VID; De Beer, ZW; Debets, AJM; Hartog, E; Kuyper, TW; Læssoe, T; Slippers, B; Aanen, DK",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2009,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.04036.x,0.808451333904886,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.977317162788872,0.0226828372111278,0.999999997041749,2.9582508664916e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
13224,Efficacy of chemical and fluorescent protein markers in studying plant colonization by endophytic non-pathogenic Fusarium oxysporum isolates,"In studying plant colonization by inoculated Fusarium oxysporum endophytes, it is important to be able to distinguish inoculated isolates from saprophytic strains. In the current study, F. oxysporum isolates were transformed with the green (GFP) and red fluorescent protein (DsRed) genes, and benomyl- and chlorate-resistant mutant isolates were also developed. The benomyl- and chlorate-resistant mutants, and the fluorescently labelled transformants, were able to grow on potato dextrose agar amended with 20 mg Benlate® l-1, 30 g chlorate l-1 and 150 μg hygromycin ml-1, respectively. Single spores of all mutants remained stable after several transfers on non-selective media. Most mutants and transformants produced colony diameters that did not differ significantly from that of their wild-type progenitors after 7 days of growth on non-selective media. Few mutants, however, had growth rates that were either slower or faster than for their wild-types. Plant colonization studies showed that root and rhizome tissue colonization by most benomyl- and chlorate-resistant mutants was similar to that of their wild-type isolates. Unlike GFP transformants, DsRed transformants were difficult to visualize in planta. Both the mutants and transformants can be used for future studies to investigate colonization, distribution and survival of biocontrol F. oxysporum endophytes in banana plants. © International Organization for Biological Control (IOBC) 2009.",Paparu P.; Macleod A.; Dubois T.; Coyne D.; Viljoen A.,BioControl,2009,10.1007/s10526-009-9221-1,0.994270066800421,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999884676923028,1.1532307697166e-4,0.999999999783291,2.16708651024078e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

1458,Fungal endophyte Penicillium janthinellum LK5 can reduce cadmium toxicity in Solanum lycopersicum (Sitiens and Rhe),"We investigated the role of gibberellins-producing endophyte Penicillium janthinellum LK5 associated with Solanum lycopersicum (host), abscisic acid (ABA)-deficient tomato mutant Sitiens and its wild-type Rheinlands Ruhm (Rhe) plants under cadmium (Cd) stress. A 100-mu M Cd application to host, Sitiens and Rhe reduced the shoot growth, chlorophyll content and stomatal conductance. However, these parameters were significantly (P < 0.0011) higher (1.0- to 2.6-folds) in host, Sitiens and Rhe under endophytic association than in non-endophyte infected plants (control) under Cd stress. Furthermore, endophytic association minimized the Cd-induced membrane injury and oxidative stress to host, Sitiens and Rhe plants by reducing electrolytes and lipid peroxidation while increasing the content of reduced glutathione and catalase activities as compared to non-endophyte-infected plants. Stress-responsive ABA content significantly increased (similar to 2-folds) in Sitiens and Rhe under endophyte association, while in host plants it was decreased under Cd stress. Salicylic acid content was similar to aEuro parts per thousand 1.7-fold higher in host, Sitiens and Rhe plants under Cd stress and endophyte association than in the control. Besides gibberellins production, the endophyte has the potential to solubilize phosphates (12.73 +/- 0.24 mg/l) since higher P was observed in the roots of Sitiens, Rhe and host plants. Similarly, nutrients like sulfur and calcium were more efficiently assimilated in roots of endophyte-associated plants than control under Cd stress. Conversely, Cd accumulation was significantly decreased (P < 0.001) in the roots of endophyte-inoculated host, Sitiens and Rhe than control. In conclusion, endophyte symbiosis can counteract heavy metal stress which can exert negative effects on plant growth.","Khan, AL; Waqas, M; Hussain, J; Al-Harrasi, A; Lee, IJ",BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS,2014,10.1007/s00374-013-0833-3,0.992611319839258,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999986077030829,1.39229691711797e-5,0.999999999750772,2.49228304660676e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

8366,Analysis of the mechanism of saponin biotransformation in Dioscoreae nipponicae rhizoma by the endophytic fungus Fusarium sp. C39 using whole-genome sequencing,"Fusarium sp. C39 is an endophytic fungus of Dioscorea nipponica Makino. Symbiosis of Fusarium sp. C39 with Rhizoma Dioscoreae Nipponicae (RDN) can significantly increase the content of saponin, which provides a new approach for saponin production and reduces the pressure on natural sources of saponins. However, the underlying mechanism is not clear, limiting its application. In this study, the genome of Fusarium sp. C39 was sequenced, the gene functions were predicted via gene annotation, and the genome was compared to the genomes of four related species. Fusarium sp. C39 is predicted to encode many key enzyme genes involved in saponin synthesis, which could transform the mevalonate, isopentenyl pyrophosphate, and various intermediate compounds present in the RDN extract into saponins. The Fusarium sp. C39 genome contains specific genes that are conducive to its endophytic lifestyle and can provide abundant raw materials for saponin synthesis. Based on the genomic analysis, we proposed the mechanism by which Fusarium sp. C39 generates saponins and provides a theoretical basis for rapid, efficient, low-cost production of saponins.","Ding, CH; Yu, D; Chen, YY; Zhu, JY; Wu, JK; Du, XW; Wang, XJ",JOURNAL OF BASIC MICROBIOLOGY,2022,10.1002/jobm.202100664,0.916137593670734,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.866143583797039,0.133856416202961,0.999999918471272,8.15287278799204e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
12467,Double-stranded RNA-mediated interference of dumpy genes in Bursaphelenchus xylophilus by feeding on filamentous fungal transformants,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a valuable tool for studying gene function in vivo and provides a functional genomics platform in a wide variety of organisms. The pinewood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, is a prominent invasive plant-parasitic nematode and has become a serious worldwide threat to forest ecosystems. Presently, the complete genome sequence of B. xylophilus has been published, and research involving genome-wide functional analyses is likely to increase. In this study, we describe the construction of an effective silencing vector, pDH-RH, which contains a transcriptional unit for a hairpin loop structure. Utilising this vector, double-stranded (ds)RNAs with sequences homologous to the target genes can be expressed in a transformed filamentous fungus via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation technology, and can subsequently induce the knockdown of target gene mRNA expression in B. xylophilus by allowing the nematode to feed on the fungal transformants. Four dumpy genes (Bx-dpy-2, 4, 10 and 11) were used as targets to detect RNAi efficiency. By allowing the nematode to feed on target gene-transformed Fusarium oxysporum strains, target transcripts were knocked down 34-87% compared with those feeding on the wild-type strain as determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Morphological RNAi phenotypes were observed, displaying obviously reduced body length; weak dumpy or small (short and thin) body size; or general abnormalities. Moreover, compensatory regulation and non-specific silencing of dpy genes were found in B. xylophilus. Our results indicate that RNAi delivery by feeding in B. xylophilus is a successful technique. This platform may provide a new opportunity for undertaking RNAi-based, genome-wide gene functional studies in vitro in B. xylophilus. Moreover, as B. xylophilus feeds on endophytic fungi when a host has died, RNAi feeding technology will offer the prospect for developing a novel control strategy for the nematode. Furthermore, this platform may also be applicable to other parasitic nematodes that have a facultative, fungivorous habit. (C) 2016 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

6731,Genomic and transcriptomic analysis of the endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis fici reveals its lifestyle and high potential for synthesis of natural products,"Background: In recent years, the genus Pestalotiopsis is receiving increasing attention, not only because of its economic impact as a plant pathogen but also as a commonly isolated endophyte which is an important source of bioactive natural products. Pestalotiopsis fici Steyaert W106-1/CGMCC3.15140 as an endophyte of tea produces numerous novel secondary metabolites, including chloropupukeananin, a derivative of chlorinated pupukeanane that is first discovered in fungi. Some of them might be important as the drug leads for future pharmaceutics. Results: Here, we report the genome sequence of the endophytic fungus of tea Pestalotiopsis fici W106-1/CGMCC3.15140. The abundant carbohydrate-active enzymes especially significantly expanding pectinases allow the fungus to utilize the limited intercellular nutrients within the host plants, suggesting adaptation of the fungus to endophytic lifestyle. The P. fici genome encodes a rich set of secondary metabolite synthesis genes, including 27 polyketide synthases (PKSs), 12 non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPSs), five dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases, four putative PKS-like enzymes, 15 putative NRPS-like enzymes, 15 terpenoid synthases, seven terpenoid cyclases, seven fatty-acid synthases, and five hybrids of PKS-NRPS. The majority of these core enzymes distributed into 74 secondary metabolite clusters. The putative Diels-Alderase genes have undergone expansion. Conclusion: The significant expansion of pectinase encoding genes provides essential insight in the life strategy of endophytes, and richness of gene clusters for secondary metabolites reveals high potential of natural products of endophytic fungi.","Wang, XN; Zhang, XL; Liu, L; Xiang, MC; Wang, WZ; Sun, X; Che, YS; Guo, LD; Liu, G; Guo, LY; Wang, CS; Yin, WB; Stadler, M; Zhang, XY; Liu, XZ",BMC GENOMICS,2015,10.1186/s12864-014-1190-9,0.992466163057831,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996366831945607,0.00363316805439283,0.999999998423205,1.57679480583539e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

11423,Auxin-mediated relationships between apple plants and root inhabiting fungi: impact on root pathogens and potentialities of growth-promoting populations,"This study aimed to elucidate the relationship between plant hosts and root-colonizing fungi recovered from apple orchard soils that had been replanted over multiple generations. Functional relationships of three groups of filamentous fungi (Ceratobasidium sp., Cylindrocarpon-like group and Fusarium acuminatum) with apple rootstocks were evaluated in plant growth bioassays. The Cylindrocarpon-like group and Ceratobasidium sp. showed a relationship with the host plant varying from pathogenic to commensal through to mutualistic for the latter group, while that of F.acuminatum tended to be mutualistic. Seven fungal isolates of each group, which induced the highest plant growth in bioassays, were evaluated for auxin (IAA) and gibberellin (GA(3) and GA(4)) production in culture filtrate. All isolates of F.acuminatum as well as most of those of the Ceratobasidium sp. and Cylindrocarpon-like groups produced IAA in culture filtrate. IAA production was evaluated for additional isolates of endophytic fungal species from fruit tree orchards and the functionality of IAA was confirmed by growing in vitro micropropagated plantlets of apple rootstock on MS medium supplemented with fungal culture filtrate. Findings from this study may explain the difficulty in defining the precise role of diverse root-colonizing fungal populations in replant disease aetiology of fruit tree orchards. However, the results demonstrate the presence of a positive and widely available biotic component of the orchard soil biology that may be exploited for the benefit of tree growth and production.","Manici, LM; Kelderer, M; Caputo, F; Mazzola, M",PLANT PATHOLOGY,2015,10.1111/ppa.12315,0.81671281274228,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992261930191468,0.00773806980853202,0.999999843081275,1.5691872512491e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3160,Endophytic Trichoderma citrinoviride isolated from mountain-cultivated ginseng (Panax ginseng) has great potential as a biocontrol agent against ginseng pathogens,"Background: Ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer) is an invaluable medicinal plant containing various bioactive metabolites (e.g., ginsenosides). Owing to its long cultivation period, ginseng is vulnerable to various biotic constraints. Biological control using endophytes is an important alternative to chemical control. Methods: In this study, endophytic Trichoderma citrinoviride PG87, isolated from mountain-cultivated ginseng, was evaluated for biocontrol activity against six major ginseng pathogens. T. citrinoviride exhibited antagonistic activity with mycoparasitism against all ginseng pathogens, with high endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase activity. Results: T. citrinoviride inoculation significantly reduced the disease symptoms caused by Botrytis cinerea and Cylindrocarpon destructans and induced ginsenoside biosynthesis in ginseng plants. T. citrinoviride was formulated as dustable powder and granules. The formulated agents also exhibited significant biocontrol activity and induced ginsenosides production in the controlled environment and mountain area. Conclusion: Our results revealed that T. citrinoviride has great potential as a biological control agent and elicitor of ginsenoside production.

2738,Endophytic Beauveria bassiana in grapevine Vitis vinifera (L.) reduces infestation with piercing-sucking insects,"Fungi are important natural pathogens of arthropod pests and are successfully used as biocontrol agents in various crops. In addition to colonizing arthropods, evidence has accumulated that some entomopathogenic fungi like Beauveria bassiana can endophytically colonize a wide array of plant species. However, only limited information is currently available on the endophytic colonization of grapevines with B. bassiana and whether the fungus still maintains its pathogenic habit against insect pests. Greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to optimize endophytic establishment of the entomopathogenic fungus B. bassiana in younger, potted plants and mature grapevine plants in the vineyard. We used two different commercialized B. bassiana strains, applied either as conidial suspensions (ATCC 74040 and GHA) or as a formulated product (Naturalis (R), strain ATCC 74040) on grapevine leaves. The potential of endophytic B. bassiana to provide protection against putative target pest insects like the vine mealybug Planococcus ficus was assessed in a bioassay using surface sterilized leaves. Endophytic survival of B. bassiana inside leaf tissues of seven-week-old potted plants was evident for at least 21 days after inoculation, irrespective of the inoculum used. Endophytic B. bassiana reduces infestation rate and growth of P. ficus. In the vineyard B. bassiana was detected as an endophyte in mature grapevine plants up to five weeks after last application with significant reduction of infestation with grape leafhopper, Empoasca vitis.

16317,Endophytic diazotrophic communities from rice roots are diverse and weakly associated with soil diazotrophic community composition and soil properties,"Aim: Bacteria that promote plant growth, such as diazotrophs, are valuable tools for achieving a more sustainable production of important non-legume crops like rice. Different strategies have been used to discover new bacteria capable of promoting plant growth. This work evaluated the contribution of soil diazotrophs to the endophytic communities established in the roots of rice seedlings cultivated on seven representative soils from Uruguay. Methods and results: The soils were classified into two groups according to the C and clay content. qPCR, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP), and 454-pyrosequencing of the nifH gene were used for analyzing diazotrophs in soil and plantlets' roots grown from seeds of the same genotype for 25 days under controlled conditions. A similar nifH abundance was found among the seven soils, roots, or leaves. The distribution of diazotrophs was more uneven in roots than in soils, with dominance indices significantly higher than in soils (nifH T-RFLP). Dominant soils' diazotrophs were mainly affiliated to Alphaproteobacteria and Planctomycetota. Conversely, Alpha, Beta, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacillota were predominant in different roots, though undetectable in soils. Almost no nifH sequences were shared between soils and roots. Conclusions: Root endophytic diazotrophs comprised a broader taxonomic range of microorganisms than diazotrophs found in soils from which the plantlets were grown and showed strong colonization patterns.  © 2024 The Author(s).",Ferrando L.; Rariz G.; Martínez-Pereyra A.; Fernández-Scavino A.,Journal of Applied Microbiology,2024,10.1093/jambio/lxae157,0.898494336422758,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.964659705459288,0.0353402945407119,0.999999893117381,1.06882618755577e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
17469,Development and systematic validation of qPCR assays for rapid and reliable differentiation of Xylella fastidiosa strains causing citrus variegated chlorosis.,"The xylem-limited, Gram-negative, fastidious plant bacterium Xylella fastidiosa is the causal agent of citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC), a destructive disease affecting approximately half of the citrus plantations in the State of São Paulo, Brazil. The disease was recently found in Central America and is threatening the multi-billion U.S. citrus industry. Many strains of X. fastidiosa are pathogens or endophytes in various plants growing in the U.S., and some strains cross infect several host plants. In this study, a TaqMan-based assay targeting the 16S rDNA signature region was developed for the identification of X. fastidiosa at the species level. Another TaqMan-based assay was developed for the specific identification of the CVC strains. Both new assays have been systematically validated in comparison with the primer/probe sets from four previously published assays on one platform and under similar PCR conditions, and shown to be superior. The species specific assay detected all X. fastidiosa strains and did not amplify any other citrus pathogen or endophyte tested. The CVC-specific assay detected all CVC strains but did not amplify any non-CVC X. fastidiosa nor any other citrus pathogen or endophyte evaluated. Both sets were multiplexed with a reliable internal control assay targeting host plant DNA, and their diagnostic specificity and sensitivity remained unchanged. This internal control provides quality assurance for DNA extraction, performance of PCR reagents, platforms and operators. The limit of detection for both assays was equivalent to 2 to 10 cells of X. fastidiosa per reaction for field citrus samples. Petioles and midribs of symptomatic leaves of sweet orange harbored the highest populations of X. fastidiosa, providing the best materials for detection of the pathogen. These new species specific assay will be invaluable for molecular identification of X. fastidiosa at the species level, and the CVC specific assay will be very powerful for the specific identification of X. fastidiosa strains that cause citrus variegated chlorosis.",Li W; Teixeira DC; Hartung JS; Huang Q; Duan Y; Zhou L; Chen J; Lin H; Lopes S; Ayres AJ; Levy L,Journal of microbiological methods,2013,10.1016/j.mimet.2012.10.008,0.985107602923734,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.905286180072776,0.094713819927224,0.999949807532907,5.01924670931464e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12672,"Effects of root-colonizing fungi on pioneer Pinus thunbergii seedlings in primary successional volcanic mudflow on Kuchinoerabu Island, Japan","Root-colonizing fungi, such as mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophyte fungi, are often found on pioneer plant species during early primary succession. However, little is known about which fungal species are responsible for the establishment of pioneer plants when these symbionts colonize simultaneously. We investigated the root-colonizing fungal communities of Pinus thunbergii that established prior to lichens, bryophytes, and short-lived herbaceous plants in a primary successional volcanic mudflow site on Kuchinoerabu Island, Japan. We collected a total of 54 current-year and 1- to 2-year-old seedlings. The colonization of root fungi was evaluated by direct observation of key structures (e.g., mantle, arbuscule, microsclerotia, and hyphae) and molecular analysis. Of the 34 current-year seedlings collected, only 12 individuals were colonized by ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi. By contrast, all 1- to 2-year-old seedlings were colonized by ECM fungi. Seedlings colonized by pine-specific ECM fungi, specifically Rhizopogon roseolus and Suillus granulatus, showed higher nitrogen and phosphorus contents in their needles compared to non-ECM seedlings. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophyte fungi were found in only two and three individuals, respectively. The high density of mycophagous deer on Kuchinoerabu-jima may contribute to the favored dispersal of ECM fungi over other root-colonizing fungi. In conclusion, the seedling establishment of P. thunbergii at the volcanic mudflow may be largely supported by ECM fungi, with negligible effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophytes.","Ishikawa, A; Hayasaka, D; Nara, K",MYCORRHIZA,2024,10.1007/s00572-024-01142-y,0.830501840658009,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999440851716878,5.5914828312226e-4,0.999999876766297,1.23233702797876e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
7855,Soybean Fungal Endophytes Alternaria and Diaporthe spp. are Differentially Impacted by Fungicide Application,"In field trials in Iowa, we investigated the association of a fungicide applied at early pod set to the diversity and composition of foliar endophytic fungi in presenescent soybeans. The main purpose of our study was to determine whether fungicides affect the microbiome of soybean plants during the pod-fill reproductive stage. In a replicated experiment focused on the impact of a fungicide application including a quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) and a pyrazole-carboxamide spanning two growing seasons, healthy stems and leaves near the tops of soybean were sampled for endophytic fungi. The survey yielded 1,791 isolates belonging to 17 putative species, identified by morphology and sequence analysis of the ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region. Taxa were grouped by genus into operational taxonomic units: Alternaria, Colletotrichum, and Diaporthe were the dominant genera isolated. Plant parts were analyzed separately using a multivariate community analysis of isolate counts per plant. The 14.3% fluxapyroxad and 28.6% pyraclostrobin fungicide spray significantly increased the proportion of Diaporthe isolates over no-spray controls, whereas the inverse occurred for foliar Alternaria isolates. In addition, seed harvested from fields with shorter-season varieties and sprayed with fungicide showed higher percentages of Diaporthe isolates than fields with no fungicide spray. In conclusion, soybean farmers may want to consider that the application of a QoI fungicide in the absence of disease pressure might adversely impact seed quality.","Batzer, JC; Mueller, DS",PLANT DISEASE,2020,10.1094/PDIS-05-19-1001-RE,0.918404484535304,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.973415868740723,0.0265841312592767,0.999999987086101,1.29138989501953e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Alien material was removed from the non-sterilized plant samples before being submitted for extraction. It was observed that extracts collected in different spots showed different biological activities. Extracts ADS04(10.66 +/- 0,17mm) and ADS14(11.37 +/- 0,11mm) were active against Staphylococcus aureus, according to the diffusion in bioautography assay. They showed significant antioxidant activity and inhibited AChE; the cytotoxicity observed to the human breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 were higher than in normal cell line MCF-10A. ADS04 was 7.62 times more cytotoxic to MCF-7, and ADS14 was 2.03 times more cytotoxic to MDA-MB-231 than to MCF-10A. The extracts showed similar cytotoxicity between PC-3, a human prostate cancer cell line, and MCF-10A.

However, the assessment of the real ecological role and relevance to plant health of these fungi has been impaired by uncertainty in species identification, deriving from both the evolving taxonomic structure of the genus and an inaccurate use of molecular markers. In this paper, the characterization of two hazelnut endophytic strains isolated in Poland is reported with reference to their secondary metabolite profiles and interactions with pests and pathogens. Our results are indicative of a possible role of these strains in defensive mutualism which could be related to the production of several bioactive compounds, especially cyclohexadepsipeptides of the enniatin family.

Further exploration of the relationships between invasive species and their associated microbiomes, as well as the interactions with the microbiomes of native species, can lead to key new insights into invasive success and potentially new and effective control approaches. In this manuscript, we review microbial relationships with plants, outline steps necessary to develop invasive species control strategies that are based on those relationships, and use the invasive plant species Phragmites australis (common reed) as an example of how development of microbial-based control strategies can be enhanced using a collective impact approach. The proposed science agenda, developed by the Collaborative for Microbial Symbiosis and Phragmites Management, contains a foundation of sequential steps and mutually-reinforcing tasks to guide the development of microbial-based control strategies for Phragmites and other invasive species.

3478,"Sloth Hair as a Novel Source of Fungi with Potent Anti-Parasitic, Anti-Cancer and Anti-Bacterial Bioactivity","The extraordinary biological diversity of tropical forests harbors a rich chemical diversity with enormous potential as a source of novel bioactive compounds. Of particular interest are new environments for microbial discovery. Sloths - arboreal mammals commonly found in the lowland forests of Panama - carry a wide variety of micro-and macro-organisms on their coarse outer hair. Here we report for the first time the isolation of diverse and bioactive strains of fungi from sloth hair, and their taxonomic placement. Eighty-four isolates of fungi were obtained in culture from the surface of hair that was collected from living three-toed sloths (Bradypus variegatus, Bradypodidae) in Soberania National Park, Republic of Panama. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a diverse group of Ascomycota belonging to 28 distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs), several of which are divergent from previously known taxa. Seventy-four isolates were cultivated in liquid broth and crude extracts were tested for bioactivity in vitro. We found a broad range of activities against strains of the parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and Chagas disease (Trypanosoma cruzi), and against the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Fifty fungal extracts were tested for antibacterial activity in a new antibiotic profile screen called BioMAP; of these, 20 were active against at least one bacterial strain, and one had an unusual pattern of bioactivity against Gram-negative bacteria that suggests a potentially new mode of action.

17941,Effectiveness of the Zea mays-Streptomyces association for the phytoremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons impacted soils.,"Restoring polluted sites by petroleum hydrocarbons is a challenge because of their complexity and persistence in the environment. The main objective of the present study was to investigate the performance of plant-actinobacteria system for the remediation of crude petroleum and pure-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) contaminated soils. The endophytic strain Streptomyces sp. Hlh1 was tested for its ability to degrade model PAHs (phenanthrene, pyrene and anthracene) in liquid minimal medium. Streptomyces sp. Hlh1 demonstrated the ability to grow on PAHs as sole carbon and energy source, reaching hydrocarbons removal of 63%, 93% and 83% for phenanthrene, pyrene and anthracene, respectively. Maize plant was chosen to study the impact of Streptomyces sp. Hlh1 inoculation on the dissipation of contaminants and plant growth. Thus, maize seedlings grown in soils contaminated with crude petroleum and pure-PAHs were inoculated with Streptomyces sp. Hlh1. Results showed that the endophyte inoculation increased contaminants removal. Maximum hydrocarbons removal (70%) was achieved in inoculated and planted soil contaminated with crude oil, while 61%, 59%, and 46% of hydrocarbons dissipation were registered for phenanthrene, pyrene and anthracene, respectively. These degradations rates were significantly higher compared to non-inoculated systems in all the treatments evaluated. Further, it was revealed that hydrocarbons (C8-C30) were efficiently degraded in plant-Streptomyces Hlh1 system. Moreover, the inoculation with the actinobacteria resulted significant plant development and enhanced photosynthetic pigments compared to plants grown in the other experimental conditions. The present study provide evidence that the inoculation of maize plants with Streptomyces sp. Hlh1 play a remarkable role in the removal of petroleum hydrocarbons, enhancing plant development in contaminated soils.",Baoune H; Aparicio JD; Acuña A; El Hadj-Khelil AO; Sanchez L; Polti MA; Alvarez A,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2019.109591,0.532539071730656,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.941788765877622,0.0582112341223779,0.980646680434458,0.0193533195655418,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
15869,Fungal endophytes promote the accumulation of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids in Lycoris radiata,"Lycoris radiata is a main source of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids; however, the low content of these alkaloids in planta remains a limit to their pharmaceutical development and utilization. The accumulation of secondary metabolites can be enhanced in plants inoculated with fungal endophytes. In this study, we analysed the diversity of culturable fungal endophytes in different organs of L. radiata. Then, by analysing the correlation between the detectable rate of each fungal species and the content of each tested alkaloid, we proposed several fungal candidates implicated in the increase of alkaloid accumulation. This was verified by inoculating these candidates to L. radiata plants. Based on the results of two independent experiments conducted in May 2018 and October 2019, the individual inoculation of nine fungal endophytes significantly increased the total content of the tested alkaloids in the entire L. radiata plants. This is the first study in L. radiata to show that fungal endophytes are able to improve the accumulation of various alkaloids. Therefore, our results provide insights into a better understanding of interactions between plants and fungal endophytes and suggest an effective strategy for enhancing the alkaloid content in the cultivation of L. radiata. © 2020 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Zhou J.; Liu Z.; Wang S.; Li J.; Li Y.; Chen W.-K.; Wang R.,Environmental Microbiology,2020,10.1111/1462-2920.14958,0.775180458576584,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.762969581482279,0.237030418517721,0.99999922890673,7.71093269791301e-7,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
1935,Effect of the Arctic terrestrial plant Ranunculus hyperboreus on LPS-induced inflammatory response via MAPK pathways,"The Arctic flora hosts a limited number of species due to its extreme environmental conditions which also yield novel and unique secondary metabolites from withstanding plants. Considering a lack of research on bioactivity potential of Arctic flora, Ranunculus hyperboreus, an Arctic plant, was studied for its anti-inflammatory potential as a part of ongoing research on discovering novel natural bioactive products. Solvent-based fractions (H2O, n-BuOH, 85% aq. MeOH, n-hexane) from R. hyperboreus extract were observed to decrease the elevated nitrate amount during the inflammatory response of lipopolysaccharide-induced mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells. To some extent, treatment with fractions was able to regulate the expression and protein levels of inflammationrelated enzymes, iNOS and COX-2, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6. The most active fractions, H2O and 85% aq. MeOH, were suggested to exert their effect through suppressed activation of MAPK pathways, especially JNK. Based on the studies of same species, phenolic glycosides were suggested to be the main active ingredients. To our knowledge, this is the first report of any bioactivity of R. hyperboreus which could be a valuable source of natural bioactive agents against inflammation.","Kong, CS; Lee, JI; Karadeniz, F; Kim, H; Seo, Y",ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATURFORSCHUNG SECTION C-A JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES,2018,10.1515/znc-2017-0173,0.982490468038736,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.467151492018347,0.532848507981653,0.999999749997345,2.50002654911263e-7,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

It has a root endophyte, Phialocephala fortinii, in its adventitious roots at a high frequency. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the effects of P. fortinii on Al tolerance mechanisms of M. sinensis and reveal potential underlying mechanisms. In the absence of P. fortinii, M. sinensis produced chlorogenic, citric, and malic acids that could act to alleviate Al toxicity in acidic mine soil. Up on fungal inoculation, the levels of these compounds were reduced, although the growth of seedlings and Mg concentration in the roots were increased. IAA production by the fungus may contribute to enhanced plant growth whereas an increase of Mg uptake could reduce toxicity of reactive oxygen species under Al stress. These actions of P. fortinii could promote growth and survival of M. sinensis in mine sites.","Haruma, T; Yamaji, K; Masuya, H",LETTERS IN APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY,2021,10.1111/lam.13514,0.975698155236487,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999048971419773,9.5102858022661e-4,0.99999998294353,1.70564703472209e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16010,Strain and contact-dependent metabolomic reprogramming reveals distinct interaction strategies between Laccaria bicolor and Trichoderma,"The genus Trichoderma (Hypocreaceae, Ascomycota) compromises over 400 known species, that are found in various soils, on plant surfaces and as plant endophytes. Interactions between the mycoparasitic Trichoderma spp. and beneficial ectomycorrhizal fungi such as Laccaria bicolor (Hydnangiaceae, Basidiomycota) can influence the structure of fungal communities and plant symbioses. In this study, we conducted in vitro dual-culture experiments involving L. bicolor and four Trichoderma strains (T. harzianum WM24a1, MS8a1, ES8g1, and T. atrobrunneum) to analyze their metabolic responses in relation to varying degrees of physical contact. Using integrated analyses of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), hyphal metabolomes, and secreted exudates, we uncovered strong contact- and strain-dependent growth inhibition patterns: Trichoderma growth was suppressed under shared headspace, whereas L. bicolor was more strongly inhibited under direct contact. Metabolomic profiling revealed distinct and strain-specific alterations in both VOC and soluble metabolite profiles during co-cultivation, with hundreds of discriminant mass features affected. Key metabolic pathways, including amino acid, carbohydrate, lipid, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, showed differential enrichment depending on the interaction stage and fungal partner. These results demonstrate that Trichoderma–Laccaria interactions are mediated by dynamic, contact-specific chemical reprogramming and suggest that fungal recognition and competition involve coordinated changes in both volatile and non-volatile metabolite production. Our findings provide a foundation for exploring how such antagonistic interactions may influence tripartite communication in plant-associated microbial networks. They also highlight the potential role of both emitted and secreted fungal metabolites in shaping interaction dynamics through putative non-self-recognition mechanisms. © The Author(s) 2025.",Sivaprakasam Padmanaban P.B.; Stange P.; Weber B.; Ghirardo A.; Pritsch K.; Karl T.; Benz J.P.; Rosenkranz M.; Schnitzler J.-P.,Fungal Biology and Biotechnology,2025,10.1186/s40694-025-00204-w,0.629131735879137,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.791217060285277,0.208782939714723,0.999995400830568,4.59916943240657e-6,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
17378,First Report of Powdery Mildew Caused by Erysiphe cruciferarum on Garden Cress in Korea.,"Garden cress (Lepidium sativum L.), belonging to the family Brassicaceae, is an edible herb with peppery flavor and aroma (2). This plant was recently introduced and is cultivated as an edible green under organic farming in Korea. In September 2012, seedlings showing typical symptoms of powdery mildew were found in greenhouses in Pyeongchang County, Korea. Symptoms first appeared as thin white colonies, which progressed to abundant growth on the leaves and stems. Infected herbs were unmarketable mainly due to signs of senescence and withering of leaves and mostly abandoned without becoming harvested. Two samples of diseased leaves were deposited in the Korea University Herbarium (KUS Accession Nos. F27137 and F27150). Appressoria on the mycelium were well-developed, lobed, and solitary or in opposite pairs. Conidiophores were unbranched, cylindrical, 88 to 120 × 8.5 to 10 μm, and composed of 3 to 4 cells. Foot-cells of conidiophores were straight to sub-straight, cylindric, 22 to 42 μm long, and generally equal to or shorter than the upper cells. Singly produced conidia were oblong to cylindrical or oval, 34 to 52 × 14 to 18 μm with a length/width ratio of 2.2 to 3.3, with angular/rectangular wrinkling of outer walls, and no distinct fibrosin bodies. Germ tubes were produced on the perihilar position of conidia. No chasmothecia were found. These structures are typical of the powdery mildew Pseudoidium anamorph of the genus Erysiphe. The specific measurements match with those of E. cruciferarum Opiz ex L. Junell as previously described (1). To confirm the identification, the complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA from KUS-F27150 was amplified with primers ITS5 and P3 and directly sequenced (4). The resulting 554-bp sequence was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. KC414675). The amplified ITS sequence shared >99% similarity with the sequences of E. cruciferarum on several brassicaceous hosts (EU140958, FJ548627, and GU721075). Pathogenicity was confirmed through inoculation by gently dusting conidia onto leaves of five healthy potted garden cress plants. Five non-inoculated plants served as controls. Inoculated plants were isolated from non-inoculated plants in separate rooms in a greenhouse at 18 to 24°C. Inoculated plants developed signs and symptoms after 8 days, whereas the control plants remained symptomless. The fungus present on the inoculated plants was morphologically identical to that originally observed on diseased plants, fulfilling Koch's postulates. Previously, the disease was reported in several European countries and southeastern Asia (Lebanon, Israel, Iran, Iraq, India, and China) (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of powdery mildew caused by E. cruciferarum on garden cress in Korea. Since garden cress production was only recently started on a commercial scale in Korea, powdery mildew infections pose a serious threat to the production of this herb, especially in organic farming where chemical control options are limited.

11955,Spatial and temporal dynamics of the fungal community of chestnut blight cankers on American chestnut (Castanea dentata) in Michigan and Wisconsin,"Chestnut blight cankers caused by the fungal pathogen Cryphonectria parasitica on infected American chestnut trees can be invaded by hypoviruses that infect C. parasitica mycelia. Hypoviruses lower pathogen virulence (i.e. hypovirulence) and decrease the probability of stem girdling. Cankers also are susceptible to invasion by non-C parasitica fungi; however, the influence of invading fungi on disease severity is unknown. Fungi may antagonize C. parasitica growth and combine with hypovirulence to further reduce the probability of stem girdling. We conducted a survey to investigate how spatial and temporal dynamics of the fungal community within cankers correlate with canker severity and the likelihood of girdling. Cankers from six American chestnut populations were monitored from 2012 to 2016. We found that the spatial distribution of the fungal community within a canker resembled a mosaic that increased in fungal diversity over time. Cankers with increased fungal diversity were not associated with higher stem survivorship over time, compared to cankers with abundant hypovirulence in recovering chestnut populations. Fungal communities also were unstable, and cankers on surviving trees containing hypovirulence consistently were invaded by non-C. parasitica fungi. Our results suggest that canker communities are not stable, and volatility of the fungal community indicates that cankers can change quickly from less severe to more severe cankers through loss of hypovirulence. Non-C. parasitica fungi may facilitate canker expansion through greater inhibition of hypovirulent C. parasitica relative to virulent C. parasitica, which may permit virulent C. parasitica to escape hypovirus infection and resume rapid canker expansion.

4968,Functional analysis of an indole-diterpene gene cluster for lolitrem B biosynthesis in the grass endosymbiont Epichloe festucae,"Epichloe festucae Fl1 in association with Lolium perenne synthesizes a diverse range of indole-diterpene bioprotective metabolites, including lolitrem B, a potent tremorgen. The ltm genes responsible for the synthesis of these metabolites are organized in three clusters at a single sub-telomeric locus in the genome of E. festucae. Here we resolve the genetic basis for the remarkable indole-diterpene diversity observed in planta by analyzing products that accumulate in associations containing ltm deletion mutants of E. festucae and in cells of Penicillium paxilli containing copies of these genes under the control of a P. paxilli biosynthetic gene promoter. We propose a biosynthetic scheme to account for this metabolic diversity. (c) 2012 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by Elsevier B.V.

16453,"Efficacy of Lamium album as a natural fungicide: impact on seed germination, ergosterol, and mycotoxins in Fusarium culmorum-infected wheat seedlings","Fusarium culmorum is a major wheat pathogen, and its secondary metabolites (mycotoxins) cause damage to plants, animals, and human health. In the era of sustainable agriculture, eco-friendly methods of prevention and control are constantly needed. The use of plant extracts as biocontrol agents has gained popularity as they are a source of active substances that play a crucial role in fighting against phytopathogens. This study evaluated the impact of Lamium album on wheat seed germination and seedling growth. In a pot experiment, the effect of L. album on wheat seedlings artificially inoculated with F. culmorum was evaluated by measuring seedling growth parameters, and by using chromatographic methods, ergosterol and mycotoxins levels were analyzed. The results showed that the phytotoxic effect of L. album flower extracts on wheat seed germination and seedling growth was concentration dependent. The radicle length was also reduced compared to the control; however, L. album did not significantly affect the dry weight of the radicle. A slight phytotoxic effect on seed germination was observed, but antifungal effects on artificially infected wheat seedlings were also confirmed with the reduction of ergosterol level and mycotoxins accumulation in the roots and leaves after 21 days of inoculation. F. culmorum DNA was identified in the control samples only. Overall, this study is a successful in planta study showing L. album flower extract protection of wheat against the pathogen responsible for Fusarium crown and root rot. Further research is essential to study the effects of L. album extracts on key regulatory genes for mycotoxin biosynthetic pathways.

1200,Leaf and Root Endospheres Harbor Lower Fungal Diversity and Less Complex Fungal Co-occurrence Patterns Than Rhizosphere,"Plant-associated microbiomes are key determinants of host-plant fitness, productivity, and function. However, compared to bacterial community, we still lack fundamental knowledge concerning the variation in the fungal microbiome at the plant niche level. In this study, we quantified the fungal communities in the rhizosphere soil, as well as leaf and root endosphere compartments of a subtropical island shrub, Mussaenda kwangtungensis, using high-throughput DNA sequencing. We found that fungal microbiomes varied significantly across different plant compartments. Rhizosphere soil exhibited the highest level of fungal diversity, whereas the lowest level was found in the leaf endosphere. Further, the fungal communities inhabiting the root endosphere shared a greater proportion of fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with rhizosphere communities than with leaf fungal endophyte communities, despite significant separation in community structure between the two belowground compartments. The fungal co-occurrence networks in the three compartments of M. kwangtungensis showed scale-free features and non-random co-occurrence patterns and matched the topological properties of small-world and evidently modular structure. Additionally, the rhizosphere network was more complex and showed higher centrality and connectedness than the leaf and root endosphere networks. Overall, our findings provide comprehensive insights into the structural variability, niche differentiation, and co-occurrence patterns in the plant associated fungal microbiome.","Qian, X; Li, HZ; Wang, YL; Wu, BW; Wu, MS; Chen, L; Li, XC; Zhang, Y; Wang, XP; Shi, MM; Zheng, Y; Guo, LD; Zhang, DX",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2019,10.3389/fmicb.2019.01015,0.988077549387614,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996894942228973,0.00310505777102717,0.999996809579955,3.19042004470749e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

11585,Biosorption effect of Aspergillus niger and Penicillium chrysosporium for Cd- and Pb-contaminated soil and their physiological effects on Vicia faba L.,"Phytoremediation is an important solution to soil pollution management. The goal of this study is to determine the biosorption ability of the two selected fungi (Aspergillus niger and Penicillium chrysosporium) under heavy metal stress on faba bean plants. The fungal strains produced phytohormones, siderophore, ACC deaminase, and secondary metabolites. The biosorption capacity of A. niger and P. chrysosporium was 0.09 and 0.06 mg g(-1) and 0.5 and 0.4 mg g(-1) in media containing Cd and Pb, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of the fungal cell wall show primary functional groups like hydroxyl, amide, carboxyl, phosphoryl, sulfhydryl, and nitro. Therefore, A. niger and P. chrysosporium were inoculated to soils, and then the faba bean seeds were sown. After 21 days of sowing, the plants were irrigated with water to severe as control, with 100 mg L-1 of Cd and 200 mg L-1 of Pb. The results show that Cd and Pb caused a significant reduction in morphological characteristics, auxin, gibberellins, photosynthetic pigments, minerals content, and antioxidant enzymes as compared to control plants but caused a substantial boost in abscisic acid, ethylene, electrolyte leakage, lipid peroxidation, glutathione, proline, superoxide dismutase, secondary metabolites, and antioxidant capacity. In inoculated plants, metal-induced oxidative stress was modulated by inhibiting the transport of metal and decreased electrolyte leakage and lipid peroxidation. Finally, the inoculation of endophytic fungi contributed actively to the absorption of heavy metals and decreased their content in soil and plants. This could be utilized as an excellent technique in the fields of heavy metal-contaminated sustainable agriculture.","El-Mahdy, OM; Mohamed, H; Mogazy, AM",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH,2021,10.1007/s11356-021-15382-4,0.985843675198631,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.96966485540561,0.0303351445943897,0.999999049666444,9.50333556182237e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15531,"Endophytic fungi inhabiting Physalis angulata L. plant: Diversity, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities of their ethyl acetate extracts","Endophytic fungi are an essential source of biologically active compounds. They have the ability to synthesize secondary metabolites which are the same or have a high degree of similarity to their host plants. In this study, we aimed to explore the biodiversity and the bioactivities of active metabolites produced by 14 endophytic fungi isolated from the medicinal plant Physalis angulata L. (PA). Fourteen endophytic fungi were isolated from the flowers, stems, leaves, and fruit husks of PA. The endophytic fungi were cultured and incubated in the PDB medium at room temperature. After three weeks, the cultures were extracted using ethyl acetate and dried using a rotary evaporator. The antioxidant activity was evaluated against DPPH while antibacterial activity was evaluated against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus using microdilution technique. TLC analysis was also done to profile the active compounds within the extract. Hyphomycetes fungus isolated from the flower of PA exhibited a moderate antioxidant activity with an antioxidant index value of 0.59 (IC50 = 52.43 μg/mL). Six isolates have strong antibacterial activity against E. coli and S. aureus with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value ranging from 8-64 μg/mL. These endophytic fungi are one Hyphomycetes fungus isolated from the flower, one Fusarium sp. isolated from the stem, and four Colletotrichum sp. isolated from leaf and fruit husk of PA.

3963,"EFFECTS OF SEVERAL FUNGICIDES ON THE LOLIUM ENDOPHYTE IN RYEGRASS PLANTS, SEEDS, AND IN CULTURE","The Lolium endophyte is the cause of ryegrass staggers in livestock. A range of fungicides, mostly systemic and many in the ergosterol-biosynthesis inhibiting group, was tested against the Lolium endophyte. Fungicides were sprayed on infected plants or applied as seed treatments to infected seed, and were also tested for their ability to inhibit growth of the fungus in culture at concentrations of 2.5-5000 ppm. The endophyte was resistant to many fungicides, and only propiconazole (Tilt) reduced the level of endophyte after foliar application. In culture, the fungus was most sensitive to prochloraz (Sportak), but showed some sensitivity to propiconazole and imazalil (Fungaflor). Prochloraz completely controlled the fungus in seed, and propiconazole gave good, but not complete, control. Both chemicals produced some phytotoxic effects. No control was obtained with seed treatments of triadimenol + fuberidizol (Baytan F17) or carboxin + thiram (Vitaflo 200).","HARVEY, IC; FLETCHER, LR; EMMS, LM",NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,1982,10.1080/00288233.1982.10425226,0.974217951877013,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.978232691446102,0.0217673085538984,0.999999949726057,5.02739427865606e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
9813,A Quantitative Review of Fungicide Efficacy for Managing Downy Mildew in Cucurbits,"A meta-analysis of the effect of fungicides on cucurbit downy mildew was conducted using data previously published in Fungicide & Nematicide Tests and Plant Disease Management Reports from 2000 to 2008. Standardized mean effect size (the difference in disease intensity expressed in standard deviation units between the fungicide treatment and its corresponding untreated control) was calculated for each of the 105 field studies evaluating the effects of fungicides on cucurbit downy mildew. Fixed- and random-effects meta-analyses were performed on the log-transformed standardized mean effect sizes to estimate the overall mean effect size ((L) over bar (+)), and to determine the variability in the effect size among studies. Fungicides led to a significant (P < 0.001) reduction in disease with an <(L)over bar>(+) value of 1.198, indicating that, overall, fungicides were highly effective against cucurbit downy mildew. Fixed- and random-effects meta-analyses were then conducted to determine the effects of moderator variables on (L) over bar (+). The fixed-effects model resulted in narrower 95% confidence intervals and generally lower estimates of moderator subgroup mean effect size ((L) over bar) than the random-effects models. Fungicide efficacy was significantly (P < 0.001) greater in cucumber, with <(L)over bar> being 26.5% higher in cucumber than in other cucurbits. Year of study, number of sprays, and disease pressure in the control significantly (P < 0.001) affected <(L)over bar>. Fungicide efficacy was significantly lower during the 2004-05 season than prior to or after the 2004-05 season. Studies in which disease pressure was moderate had a significantly higher (L) over bar than studies with either low or high disease pressure. Fungicide efficacy was >= 22% in studies that received 5 to 6 sprays than in studies that received 1 to 4 or >6 sprays. Fungicide products led to a significant (P < 0.001) reduction in disease, although there was substantial between-study variability. The pyridinylmethyl-benzamide group of fungicides (fluopicolide) was the most effective, followed by the carbamate (propamocarb) and quinone inside inhibitors (cyazofamid) group of fungicides, while the carboxylic acid amide group (mandipropamid and dimethomorph) was the least effective. A combination of protectant and systemic fungicides resulted in a proportional increase in <(L)over bar> compared with sole application of either protectant or systemic fungicides.","Ojiambo, PS; Paul, PA; Holmes, GJ",PHYTOPATHOLOGY,2010,10.1094/PHYTO-12-09-0348,0.988607987298087,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985792190107565,0.0142078098924347,0.999999887527191,1.12472808622144e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
9987,Chaenomeles speciosa fruit endophytic fungi isolation and characterization of their antimicrobial activity and the secondary metabolites composition,"Background Endophytes promote the survival of the host plants affected by unfavorable environment. To confirm the endophytes role in Chaenomeles speciosa pathogenic resistance, fungal isolates were derived from both fruit peel and pulp, and presumptively identified using macroscopic and microscopic techniques. Antifungal potential of the isolates was assayed by dual culture method and agar disc method against Alternaria alternata, Fusarium culmorum, and Fusarium oxysporum strains. Two most active fungal isolates were cultured in Czapek's liquid medium to obtain metabolites. The crude ethyl acetate extracts of metabolites were characterized for antibacterial activity against Basillus subtilis and Erwinia dissolvens, and for component composition by GC-MS technique. Results Nine fungal endophytic isolates were derived from the peel and pulp of C. speciosa fruits and tentatively attributed to Penicillium spp. (seven isolates), Aspergillus spp. (one isolate), Mucor spp. (one isolate). Two fungal isolates, one each of the fruit peel and pulp, were designated as Penicillium sp. I and Penicillium sp. II respectively, and selected for further research. Both isolates showed similar activity against A. alternata; however, Penicillium sp. I activity against F. culmorum and F. oxysporum exceeded the activity of Penicillium sp. II. Cultural medium ethyl acetate extracts of both endophytes exhibited higher antibacterial activity against Gram-positive B. subtilis, while mycelium extracts were more active against Gram-negative E. dissolvens. In general, Penicillium sp. I antibacterial activity was higher in cultural medium extracts, while activity of Penicillium sp. II dominated in mycelium extracts. GC-MS analysis of the fungal metabolites component composition revealed the identity of 27 and 17 compounds, respectively in the ethyl acetate extracts of Penicillium sp. I and Penicillium sp. II cultural medium. Basic compounds produced by the first isolate, were represented by 3-Furanacetic acid, 4-hexyl-2,5-dihydro-2,5-dioxo, Diisooctyl phthalate, 11-Hexadecyn-1-ol, and Propanedioic acid, dihydroxy. At the same time, Phthalic acid diisooctyl ester and other phthalates constituted the main part of the second isolate metabolites, followed by Hexadecanoic acid, Eicosyl isopropyl ether, and 4-Butoxy-2-butanone at a lower content. Conclusions The findings showed that the antimicrobial potential of Chaenomeles fruits endophytic fungi is promising and deserves further investigation.","Lykholat, YV; Khromykh, NO; Didur, OO; Drehval, OA; Sklyar, TV; Anishchenko, AO",BENI-SUEF UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF BASIC AND APPLIED SCIENCES,2021,10.1186/s43088-021-00171-2,0.942836389595307,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999847512639319,1.5248736068097e-4,0.999999999999319,6.80677736397683e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15343,CHANGES IN ANTIOXIDANT ENZYMES OF BARLEY (Hordeum vulgare L.) USING THE ENDOPHYTIC FUNGUS PIRIFORMOSPORA INDICA AND THE BACTERIUM AZOSPIRILLUM SPP. UNDER DROUGHT STRESS,"SUMMARY Piriformospora indica and Azospirillum spp. due to great ability to effectively improve plant growth and stress tolerance, have been considered significantly in recent decades. The present study was conducted as factorial based on a randomized complete block with three replications in the research field of Plant Production Engineering and Genetics, Faculty of Agriculture, Maragheh University. The experimental treatments included three levels of stress (full irrigation, irrigation at 70% of field capacity, and irrigation at 50% of field capacity), endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica (non-use and use) and bacterium Azospirillum (non-use and use). The results of the present study showed that the interaction between drought stress and using fungi and bacteria had a significant effect at the probability level of 1% on leaf area, chlorophyll a, the activity of glutathione reductase, ascorbate peroxidase, and catalase; and the content of malondialdehyde, hydrogen peroxide, superoxide dismutase, Fe-SOD isozymes, Mn-SOD, and proline at the probability level of 5% on Cu/Zn-SOD isozyme. The simple effects of the studied treatments were also significant on the parameters of chlorophyll b and carotenoids at the statistical level of 1%. The highest content of superoxide dismutase, Cu/Zn-SOD, Fe-SOD, Mn-SOD isozymes, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase peroxidase and glutathione reductase was obtained from inoculation with bacteria and fungi in irrigation treatment at 50% of field capacity resulting in a reduction by 47.01 and 33.93% in the content of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde in irrigation treatment at 50% of field capacity and the combined use of fungi and bacteria compared to the non-use of fungi and bacteria in the same treatment. So, it can be concluded that the combined use of Piriformospora indica and Azospirillum spp. under conditions of severe drought stress can play an important role in modulating Barley growth. © 2022, University of Montenegro.

First, as per phylogenetic analysis, the strains were divided into four groups: CkDB2, CkDB5, MoAL2 and MoAL5. All of these were DSEs, which could form microsclerotia in M. oiwakensis. The growth response experiment revealed that inoculation of the plant with MoAL5 and CkDB5 promoted an increase in the total fresh weight of the seedlings. Chemical composition analysis showed that seedlings inoculated with CkDB5 had the highest berberine concentration.

A total of 70 bacterial isolates were characterized by both biochemical and molecular identification methods. Taxonomic classification showed dominance of three major phyla, viz, Firmicutes (57.1%), Actinobacteria (20.0%) and Proteobacteria (22.8%). Screening for in vitro plant growth-promoting activities revealed a hitherto unreported endophytic bacterium from wild rice germplasm, Microbacterium laevaniformans RS0111 with highest indole acetic acid (28.39 ± 1.39 µg/ml) and gibberellic acid (67.23 ± 1.83 µg/ml) producing efficiency.

4376,Use of Endophytic and Rhizosphere Actinobacteria from Grapevine Plants To Reduce Nursery Fungal Graft Infections That Lead to Young Grapevine Decline,"Endophytic and rhizosphere actinobacteria isolated from the root system of 1-year-old grafted Vitis vinifera plants were evaluated for their activities against fungi that cause grapevine trunk diseases. A total of 58 endophytic and 94 rhizosphere isolates were tested. Based on an in vitro bioassay, 15.5% of the endophytic isolates and 30.8% of the rhizosphere isolates exhibited antifungal activity against the fungal pathogen Diplodia seriata, whereas 13.8% of the endophytic isolates and 16.0% of the rhizosphere isolates showed antifungal activity against Dacty-lonectria macrodidyma (formerly Ilyonectria macrodidyma). The strains which showed the greatest in vitro efficacy against both pathogens were further analyzed for their ability to inhibit the growth of Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Phaeoacremonium minimum (formerly Phaeoacremonium aleophilum). Based on their antifungal activity, three rhizosphere isolates and three endophytic isolates were applied on grafts in an open-root field nursery in a 3-year trial. The field trial led to the identification of one endophytic strain, Streptomyces sp. VV/E1, and two rhizosphere isolates, Streptomyces sp. VV/R1 and Streptomyces sp. VV/R4, which significantly reduced the infection rates produced by the fungal pathogens Dactylonectria sp., Ilyonectria sp., P. chlamy-dospora, and P. minimum, all of which cause young grapevine decline. The VV/R1 and VV/R4 isolates also significantly reduced the mortality level of grafted plants in the nursery. This study shows that certain actinobacteria could represent a promising new tool for controlling fungal trunk pathogens that infect grapevine plants through the root system in nurseries. IMPORTANCE Grapevine trunk diseases are a major threat to the wine and grape industry worldwide. They cause a significant reduction in yields as well as in grape quality, and they can even cause plant death. Trunk diseases are caused by fungal pathogens that enter through pruning wounds and/or the root system. Although different strategies have recently been developed to protect pruning wounds using antifungal compounds (natural or synthetic) or biocontrol agents, no tools are yet available for controlling soil pathogens that infect plants through their root system. This study shows that different actinobacterial isolates, when applied to grafts in a nursery, can significantly reduce the infection rate caused by fungal pathogens that enter through the root system. This is a new, promising, and green alternative for preventing the decline of young grapevines in nurseries and vineyards.","Alvarez-Pérez, JM; González-García, S; Cobos, R; Olego, MA; Ibañez, A; Díez-Galán, A; Garzón-Jimeno, E; Coque, JJR",APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,2017,10.1128/AEM.01564-17,0.906721026540662,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999476796045471,5.2320395452937e-4,0.999999999614093,3.85907195088464e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Plant samples were collected from three districts, Kamrup, Barpeta and Biswanath of Assam for endophytic fungal isolation. Variation was found in the distribution of fungal endophytes in stems and leaves of the plant collected from different locations under study. The percentage isolation of the endophytic fungal isolates was more from the stems collected from Kamrup (M) whereas the percentage isolation of endophytic fungal isolates was more from the leaves collected from Biswanath Chariali and Barpeta. Shannon-diversity and Simpson diversity indices of fungal endophytes varied in stems and leaves of the plant under study. This variation can be attributed to the soil conditions of the sampling site as well as the seasonal variation during sampling periods. Cladosporium sp. and Fusarium sp., are the most dominant and frequently occurring endophytic fungal species in C. quadrangularis of Kamrup (M) and Barpeta districts. Colletotrichum sp. and Rhizopus sp. were the dominant endophytic fungal species in Biswanath district. Since C. quadrangularis is used traditionally in the treatments of bone fracture, the study of endophytes associated to this plant could be of paramount significance with a scope of identifying the potent endophytes that are capable of producing bioactive compounds necessary in bone-healing. © 2023, Pavol Jozef Safarik University in Kosice.

6353,Screening of Mycotoxigenic Fungi in Barley and Barley Malt (Hordeum vulgare L.) Using Real-Time PCR-A Comparison between Molecular Diagnostic and Culture Technique,"Filamentous fungi have a crucial impact on the food safety and technological quality of malting barley. Commonly used techniques for the detection of seed-borne fungi are based on cultivation and identification by morphological criteria. In contrast, this study established a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay based on SYBR green technology for the detection and quantification of black fungal species (Alternaria spp., Epicoccum nigrum, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Penicillium verrucosum and Aspergillus niger) on brewing barley and compares it with the traditional cultivation technique and visual assessment. To screen the fungal spectrum over different barley varieties and harvest years, naturally infected samples of malting barley and corresponding malts (Hordeum vulgare L.) were analyzed over four consecutive years (2018-2021), grown under different climatic conditions in Germany. Alternaria and Cladosporium spp. DNA were present in all examined barley samples, even without visible contamination. In contrast, detection via culture-based methods does not reliably cover all species. Molecular analysis showed that there was less fungal biomass after malting, by 58.57% in the case of A. alternata, by 28.27% for Cladosporium spp. and by 12.79% for Epicoccum nigrum. Correlation analysis showed no causal relationship between fungal DNA and the number of black kernels. The qPCR provides a highly sensitive and time-saving screening method for detecting latent fungal infections in brewing grains to identify batches that are potentially highly contaminated with toxigenic fungi.","Bretträger, M; Becker, T; Gastl, M",FOODS,2022,10.3390/foods11081149,0.96773349792298,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.893381481134136,0.106618518865864,0.999996275866519,3.72413348137535e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

15995,Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic exploration of Avicennia germinans L.: Endophytic microbiome of leaves and roots,"Mangroves are productive coastal ecosystems with extreme environmental conditions of temperature, salinity and anthropogenic pollution. Their associated microbiota plays an essential role in plant survival, yet their functional dynamics remain poorly understood. This study characterizes the endophytic microbiome of Avicennia germinans L. in the Buenaventura Bay mangrove ecosystem (Colombia), using a combined metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approach. Distinct microbial communities were observed in leaves and pneumatophores. Root-associated endophytes exhibited higher taxonomic richness and greater transcriptional activity. Functional gene expression revealed enrichment of pathways related to osmotic and oxidative stress responses, hydrocarbon degradation, nitrogen metabolism, and ion homeostasis. The expression of efflux pumps, NADH dehydrogenase, cytochromes, chaperones, H⁺-ATPases, and H⁺/Na⁺ antiporters suggest active microbial participation in salinity, heavy metal, xenobiotics and stress resistance. These findings highlight the adaptive versatility of the endophytic microbiome in A. germinans and support its potential for biotechnological applications in stress resistance and bioremediation. © 2025 The Authors",Lemos-Lucumi C.A.; Cárdenas-Hernández V.; Toro-Perea N.,Microbiological Research,2025,10.1016/j.micres.2025.128287,0.956886595422389,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.965312639883915,0.0346873601160854,0.999999243670175,7.56329824547208e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

3821,Gamarada debralockiae gen. nov sp nov.-the genome of the most widespread Australian ericoid mycorrhizal fungus,"This study describes a novel ericoid mycorrhizal fungus (ErMF), Gamarada debralockiae Midgley and Tran-Dinh gen. nov. sp. nov. Additionally, catabolism was explored from a genomic perspective. The nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of G. debralockiae were sequenced. Morphological characteristics were assessed on various media. Catabolic genes of G. debralockiae were explored using SignalP and dbCAN. Phylogenetic comparisons were undertaken using Phylogeny.fr. The 58.5-Mbp draft genome of G. debralockiae contained 17,075 putative genes. The complete mitochondrial genome was 28,168 bp in length. In culture, G. debralockiae produces slow-growing non-sporulating colonies. Gamarada debralockiae has many putative secreted catabolic enzymes. Phylogeny indicated G. debralockiae was distinct from known ascomycetous ErMF: Pezoloma ericae, Meliniomyces spp., Oidiodendron spp., and Cairneyella variabilis. It is closely related to many undescribed plant root-associated fungi and its nearest described relative is Hyphodiscus brevicollaris. Gamarada debralockiae has been recovered from virtually all Australian ericoid mycorrhizal studies and biogeographic data suggests the taxon is widespread in Australia. Gamarada debralockiae has similar catabolic potential to C. variabilis and co-occurs with C. variabilis at Australian sites. Plants that host multiple ErMF may benefit from subtle differences in catabolism that improve access to nitrogen and phosphorus from within recalcitrant organic matter.","Midgley, DJ; Sutcliffe, B; Greenfield, P; Nai, TD",MYCORRHIZA,2018,10.1007/s00572-018-0835-y,0.903439310096834,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.984770776515006,0.0152292234849939,0.999987561982291,1.24380177090044e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3645,Insect pathogens as biological control agents: Back to the future,"The development and use of entomopathogens as classical, conservation and augmentative biological control agents have included a number of successes and some setbacks in the past 15 years. In this forum paper we present current information on development, use and future directions of insect-specific viruses, bacteria, fungi and nematodes as components of integrated pest management strategies for control of arthropod pests of crops, forests, urban habitats, and insects of medical and veterinary importance. Insect pathogenic viruses are a fruitful source of microbial control agents (MCAs), particularly for the control of lepidopteran pests. Most research is focused on the baculoviruses, important pathogens of some globally important pests for which control has become difficult due to either pesticide resistance or pressure to reduce pesticide residues. Baculoviruses are accepted as safe, readily mass produced, highly pathogenic and easily formulated and applied control agents. New baculovirus products are appearing in many countries and gaining an increased market share. However, the absence of a practical in vitro mass production system, generally higher production costs, limited post application persistence, slow rate of kill and high host specificity currently contribute to restricted use in pest control. Overcoming these limitations are key research areas for which progress could open up use of insect viruses to much larger markets. A small number of entomopathogenic bacteria have been commercially developed for control of insect pests. These include several Bacillus thuringiensis sub-species, Lysinibacillus (Bacillus) sphaericus, Paenibacillus spp. and Serratia entomophila. B. thuringiensis sub-species kurstaki is the most widely used for control of pest insects of crops and forests, and B. thuringiensis sub-species israelensis and L. sphaericus are the primary pathogens used for control of medically important pests including dipteran vectors. These pathogens combine the advantages of chemical pesticides and MCAs: they are fast acting, easy to produce at a relatively low cost, easy to formulate, have a long shelf life and allow delivery using conventional application equipment and systemics (i.e. in transgenic plants). Unlike broad spectrum chemical pesticides, B. thuringiensis toxins are selective and negative environmental impact is very limited. Of the several commercially produced MCAs, B. thuringiensis (Bt) has more than 50% of market share. Extensive research, particularly on the molecular mode of action of Bt toxins, has been conducted over the past two decades. The Bt genes used in insect-resistant transgenic crops belong to the Cry and vegetative insecticidal protein families of toxins. Bt has been highly efficacious in pest management of corn and cotton, drastically reducing the amount of broad spectrum chemical insecticides used while being safe for consumers and non-target organisms. Despite successes, the adoption of Bt crops has not been without controversy. Although there is a lack of scientific evidence regarding their detrimental effects, this controversy has created the widespread perception in some quarters that Bt crops are dangerous for the environment. In addition to discovery of more efficacious isolates and toxins, an increase in the use of Bt products and transgenes will rely on innovations in formulation, better delivery systems and ultimately, wider public acceptance of transgenic plants expressing insect-specific Bt toxins. Fungi are ubiquitous natural entomopathogens that often cause epizootics in host insects and possess many desirable traits that favor their development as MCAs. Presently, commercialized microbial pesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi largely occupy niche markets. A variety of molecular tools and technologies have recently allowed reclassification of numerous species based on phylogeny, as well as matching anamorphs (asexual forms) and teleomorphs (sexual forms) of several entomopathogenic taxa in the Phylum Ascomycota. Although these fungi have been traditionally regarded exclusively as pathogens of arthropods, recent studies have demonstrated that they occupy a great diversity of ecological niches. Entomopathogenic fungi are now known to be plant endophytes, plant disease antagonists, rhizosphere colonizers, and plant growth promoters. These newly understood attributes provide possibilities to use fungi in multiple roles. In addition to arthropod pest control, some fungal species could simultaneously suppress plant pathogens and plant parasitic nematodes as well as promote plant growth. A greater understanding of fungal ecology is needed to define their roles in nature and evaluate their limitations in biological control. More efficient mass production, formulation and delivery systems must be devised to supply an ever increasing market. More testing under field conditions is required to identify effects of biotic and abiotic factors on efficacy and persistence. Lastly, greater attention must be paid to their use within integrated pest management programs; in particular, strategies that incorporate fungi in combination with arthropod predators and parasitoids need to be defined to ensure compatibility and maximize efficacy. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) in the genera Steinernema and Heterorhabditis are potent MCAs. Substantial progress in research and application of EPNs has been made in the past decade. The number of target pests shown to be susceptible to EPNs has continued to increase. Advancements in this regard primarily have been made in soil habitats where EPNs are shielded from environmental extremes, but progress has also been made in use of nematodes in above-ground habitats owing to the development of improved protective formulations. Progress has also resulted from advancements in nematode production technology using both in vivo and in vitro systems; novel application methods such as distribution of infected host cadavers; and nematode strain improvement via enhancement and stabilization of beneficial traits. Innovative research has also yielded insights into the fundamentals of EPN biology including major advances in genomics, nematode-bacterial symbiont interactions, ecological relationships, and foraging behavior. Additional research is needed to leverage these basic findings toward direct improvements in microbial control. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Here we focused on the dominant Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia oceanica and assessed its root mycobiome at 32 localities covering most of the ecoregions in the NW Mediterranean Sea using light and scanning electron microscopy and tag-encoded 454-pyrosequencing. Microscopy revealed that the recently discovered dark septate endophytic association specific for P. oceanica is present at all localities and pyrosequencing confirmed that the P. oceanica root mycobiome is dominated by a single undescribed pleosporalean fungus, hitherto unknown from other hosts and ecosystems. Its numerous slow-growing isolates were obtained from surface-sterilised root segments at one locality and after prolonged cultivation, several of them produced viable sterile mycelium. To infer their phylogenetic relationships we sequenced and analysed the large (LSU) and small (SSU) subunit nrDNA, the ITS nrDNA and the DNA-directed RNA polymerase II (RPB2). The fungus represents an independent marine biotrophic lineage in the Aigialaceae (Pleosporales) and is introduced here as Posidoniomyces atricolor gen. et sp. nov. Its closest relatives are typically plantassociated saprobes from marine, terrestrial and freshwater habitats in Southeast Asia and Central America.

16376,Molecular Characterization of Endophytic Fungi from the Leaves of Beruwas Laut (Scaevola taccada (Gaertn.) Roxb.) as Antibacterial Producer,"Endophytic fungi live and develop in plant tissues, are symbiotic, and are host-plant friendly. These fungi generally produce secondary metabolites with anticancer, antiviral, or antibacterial properties. This study aims to identify endophytic fungi isolated from Beruwas laut leaves. The endophytic fungi were isolated from Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA), while the secondary metabolites were produced by fermentation on Maltose Yeast Broth medium, agitated for 18 days at 150 rpm. The chemical composition of the fungi was identified using TLC. The antibacterial activity was assessed against some pathogenic bacteria strains through agar diffusion and TLC-Bioautography methods, while molecular identification was conducted using PCR. The results revealed 16 chemical isolates from the endophytic fungi, among which IFDBL-15 exhibited the most potent antibacterial activity. Inhibitory zones of the isolates against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 14990), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25923), and Salmonella typhi (NCTC 786) were 15.47, 14.52, 14.64, 14.10, 15.92, and 15.52 mm, respectively. The fermentation extract of the IFDBL-15 isolate contained flavonoids, alkaloids, anthraquinones, and saponins. TLC-Bioautography activity revealed four active spots. The spot that inhibited all test bacteria was identified as a flavonoid (Rf = 0.45). Molecular identification using ITS1 and ITS4 gene regions via Polymerase Chain Reaction showed that the IFDBL-15 isolate exhibited the closest relationship to the species Parengyodontium album with an identity match of 99.83%.

14060,Research developments on the effects of grass – endophyte fungi symbiosis on soil physical and chemical properties and microbes; [禾草– 内生真菌共生对土壤理化性质及其微生物影响的研究进展],"Grass-endophyte symbiosis can promote plant resistance for adversities, enhances agronomic traits, as well as reduces the feeding of herbivores. Underground processes are mainly altered through litter decomposition dynamics and roots exuding organic compounds that influence the underground biological processes. The effect of grass-endophyte symbiosis on soil physical, chemical, and biological properties and processes varies depending on the type of grass, endophyte strain, and soil type. The effects on the physical properties of soil mainly relate to soil structure, and the effects on soil chemical composition are mainly reflected in the changes to soil carbon and nitrogen. The effects on soil biology were mainly observed in soil fungi, gram-negative bacteria, and nematodes. In this paper we reviewed the responses of grass-endophyte symbiosis on soil properties and functions to elucidate the mechanisms of interactions between grasses and microorganisms in the host soil habitat and their functions, to generate new knowledge for the discovery and development of novel endophytic grass cultivars. The aims are to (1) elucidate the mechanism and function of interaction between symbionts and microorganisms in host soil habitats, (2) to identify and develop novel grass-endophytic fungi symbionts and (3) to utilize these to alter the soil microenvironment, providing a theoretical basis for the discovery and development of new grass-endophytic fungal symbionts and the use of new grass-endophytic fungi symbiosis to change the soil microenvironment. © 2019 Editorial Office of Pratacultural Science.

Methods and Results: Sixty-eight chitinolytic endophytic Actinomycetes were recovered from various medicinal plants and evaluated for their chitinase activity. Among these isolates, 12 were screened for their plant growth promoting abilities and antagonistic potential against Sc. rolfsii. Further, these isolates were validated in vivo for their ability to protect chickpea against Sc. rolfsii infestation under greenhouse conditions. The isolates significantly (P < 0·05) increased the biomass (1·2–2·0 fold) and reduced plant mortality (42–75%) of chickpea.

19804,Fungal endophytes protect grass seedlings against herbivory and allow economical seed production,"Background: When infected with seed-transmitted fungal endophytes, some grasses produce a larger quantity of seeds, although these seeds are smaller than normal. The principles of life-history theory suggest that this size reduction could evolve if the infection reduces predation pressure. Question: Does the endophyte protect grass seedlings against herbivory? Hypothesis: Herbivores consume more seedlings that develop from endophyte-free grass seeds than from endophyte-infected grass seeds. Organisms: Epichloe typhina is the seed-transmitted endophytic fungus, the weeping alkaligrass (Puccinellia distans) seedlings are the hosts, and the grove snail (Cepaea nemoralis) is the herbivore. Methods: Our experiment consisted of two 66-h food-choice tests. The tests were performed consecutively and on the same individual snails. We offered snails freshly harvested weeping alkaligrass seedlings with and without the endophyte. Results: Starved snails consumed approximately 20% less biomass of infected seedlings than uninfected seedlings.

5640,Influence of Host and Geographic Locale on the Distribution of Colletotrichum cereale Lineages,"Colletotrichum cereale is an ascomycete inhabitant of cool-season Pooideae grasses. The fungus has increased in frequency over the past decade as a destructive pathogen of Poa annua and Agrostis stolonifera turfgrass. Colletotrichum cereale exists as two lineages, designated clades A and B, but little is known about the distribution of these clades in natural environments, or what role these subdivisions may play in the trajectory of disease outbreaks. In this study, our objective was to determine the frequency of C. cereale clades A and B. To rapidly discriminate between the two C. cereale clades, a real-time PCR assay was developed based on the Apn2 gene. A collection of 700 C. cereale pathogens and endophytes from twenty Pooideae grass genera were genotyped. 87% of the collection was identifed as part of clade A, 11.7% as part of clade B, and 1.3% was a mixture. Colletotrichum cereale from turfgrass hosts in North America were most commonly members of clade A (78%). The overabundance of clade A in turfgrass isolates was directly attributable to the dominance of this lineage from southern sampling sites, irrespective of host. In contrast, 111 C. cereale turfgrass isolates collected from northern sampling sites were evenly distributed between clades A and B. Only 28% of C. cereale from A. stolonifera at northern sampling sites were part of clade A. These data show that environmental factors such as geographic location and host identity likely played a role in the distribution of the major C. cereale clades in North American turfgrass.","Beirn, LA; Clarke, BB; Crouch, JA",PLOS ONE,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0097706,0.649656573932628,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992367142190569,0.00763285780943055,0.999999999875335,1.24664945033715e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
18166,Effects of Different Sources of Nitrogen on Endophytic Colonization of Rice Plants by Azospirillum sp. B510.,"Azospirillum sp. B510, a free-living nitrogen-fixing bacterium isolated from the stems of rice (Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare), was investigated to establish effective conditions for the colonization of rice plants. We analyzed the effects of the nitrogen sources KNO3, NH4Cl, urea (CO[NH2]2), and NH4NO3 at different concentrations (0.01-10 mM) on this colonization. Nitrogen promoted plant growth in a concentration-dependent manner, with minor differences being observed among the different nitrogen sources. Bacterial colonization was markedly suppressed on media containing NH4+ concentrations higher than 1 mM. Since concentrations of up to and including 10 mM NH4+ did not exhibit any antibacterial activity, we analyzed several factors affecting the NH4+-dependent inhibition of endophytic colonization, including the accumulation of the reactive oxygen species H2O2 and the secretion of the chemotactic substrate malic acid. The accumulation of H2O2 was increased in rice roots grown on 1 mM NH4Cl. The amounts of malic acid secreted from NH4-grown rice plants were lower than those secreted from plants grown without nitrogen or with KNO3. Although the bacterium exhibited chemotactic activity, moving towards root exudates from plants grown without nitrogen and KNO3-grown plants, this activity was not observed with root exudates from NH4+-grown plants. NH4+, but not NO3-, caused the acidification of growth media, which inhibited plant bacterial colonization. These NH4+-dependent phenomena were markedly suppressed by the stabilization of medium pH using a buffer. These results demonstrate that the type and concentration of nitrogen fertilizer affects the colonization of rice plants by Azospirillum sp.

In the study, 171 endophytic fungi were isolated from the roots of Aconitum carmichaelii, a traditional Chinese medicine, collected from six production sites of Yunnan Province in southwestern China These EFs were categorized to belong to 28 taxa by molecular identification, and Chaetomium and Fusarium were the dominant genera with a relative frequency of 16.96% and 16.37% respectively. Cladosporium and Pochonia were found to be unique dominant genera from the roots of A. carmichaelii in Huize and Yulong counties, respectively. The Shannon index ranged from 1.68 to 2.05 and the Simpson's diversity index ranged from 0.81 to 0.92 for the EFs of A. carmichaeli, indicating the rich diversity of EFs in A. carmichaelii. Preliminary screening of the growth inhibition of three severe fungal pathogens by the isolated EFs was conducted and 17 genera of EFs were found to inhibit the growth of the tested pathogens. For example, Acrostalagmus luteoalbus, Phoma sp., and Thielavia sp. each displayed good anti-fungal activity against Alternaria alternate, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum, and Phytophthora drechleri.

Recent studies indicate that FabH can be a potential target for bactericide development. In the present study, an immobilized FabH column was developed and used to screen FabH inhibitors from complex natural product extracts. Combined with HPLC, four secondary metabolites, alternariol (1), altenuisol (2), alterlactone (3), and dehydroaltenusin (4), were site-directed, isolated, and identified from the crude extract of Alternaria alternata ZHJG5. These compounds showed inhibitory activities on FabH of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) with IC50 values from 29.5 to 74.1 mu M and also displayed a varying degree of antibacterial activities against Xoo with minimal inhibitory concentration values from 4 to 64 mu g/mL.

11578,Endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica mitigates moisture stress in rice by modifying root growth,"We examined the drought mitigating effects of endophytic root colonization by the beneficial fungus Piriformospora indica in rice plants under varying moisture stress. In a randomized block design, P. indica colonized and non-colonized rice under different levels of moisture stress viz., ideal/non-stress, mild, moderate, severe, very severe and extremely severe stress; created by manipulating the irrigation levels based on the depth and frequency, were evaluated for growth, yield, rooting parameters, and nutrient uptake under non-flooded rice growing conditions. Growth promotive and stress protective effects were noticed in the colonized plants on the number of productive tillers, filled grains per panicle and grain yield under extremely severe stress with an enhancement of 73, 18 and 37 % respectively over control. They also had 26 and 21 % higher rooting depth than the control plants at 60 days after transplanting and harvest respectively, under severe stress which could have ensured better performance of the inoculated plants in terms of growth and yield. Colonization by the beneficial fungus also enhanced production of lateral roots contributing to 44 % higher root volume, resulting in higher area for water and nutrient absorption under severe stress. Endophyte mediated modification of the root architecture improved acquisition of phosphorus, an element directly linked to plant health under stress, by the plants under both severe stress and non-stress situations. Colonization also enhanced the water use efficiency of the plants, a factor influenced by root spread and volume, to 29 % compared to that in the non-colonized plants under severe stress.","Mani, KM; Ameena, M; Johnson, JM; Anith, KN; Pillai, PS; John, J; Beena, R",RHIZOSPHERE,2023,10.1016/j.rhisph.2023.100799,0.972020717498274,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99977755060639,2.2244939361024e-4,0.999999979625173,2.03748274918425e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15825,Harnessing chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) seed endophytes for enhancing plant growth attributes and bio-controlling against Fusarium sp.,"A seed microbiome is likely to have important impacts on plant fitness and productivity but functional potentials of seed microbiome remain poorly understood. It is also suggested that bio-inoculants developed from or compatible with seed microbiome are more likely to produce desired outcomes of sustainable increase in agriculture productivity but few empirical evidences are available. The aim of this study was to identify culturable endophytes of the germinating and dry seeds of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), and their functional attributes. We isolated 29 bacterial strains from chickpea seeds (8 strains from dry and 21 strains from germinating seeds). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA showed that the seed endophytic bacteria belong to Enterobacter sp., Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Staphylococcus sp., Pantoea sp. and Mixta sp. Isolates produced significant amount of Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) (Enterobacter hormaechei BHUJPCS-15; 58.91 μg/ml), solubilised phosphate (Bacillus subtilis BHUJPCS-24; 999.85 μg/ml) and potassium, ammonia (Bacillus subtilis BHUJPCS-12; 148.73 μg/ml), and also inhibited the growth of chickpea pathogen (Pseudomonas aeruginosa BHUJPCS-7 against Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. ciceris) under laboratory conditions. Several seed endophytes induced significant increase in plant growth and increased tolerance of chickpea plants to the pathogen (Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. ciceris) when tested in vitro. Re-introduction of these isolates, resulted in significant increase in plant length, biomass and chlorophyll contents and bio-controlling activity against Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. ciceris.

11599,Development of specific primers for detection and identification of Alternaria spp. in carrot material by PCR and comparison with blotter and plating assays,"Alternaria alternata, A. radicina and A. dauci are important seed-borne fungi on carrot, with the first two species having a high toxigenic potential, for which a specific and sensitive detection method is required. Because both the traditional deep-freeze-blotter method and plating on selective medium are time consuming and laborious, a PCR-based assay was developed. Sequences of the internal transcribed spacer regions of the ribosomal gene repeat (rDNA) from 45 different Alternaria isolates were determined, a restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was performed and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. Based on the sequences, specific primers for detection and identification of the three Alternaria species on carrot seeds and roots were designed. The primers were highly sensitive and were shown to be able to differentiate between the three Alternaria species. A. alternata and A. radicina could be detected in DNA isolated from carrot material applying the specific primers, even at low infection levels. The PCR-assay was compared to the deep-freeze-blotter method (DFBM) and plating on Alternaria radicina Selective Agar (ARSA, for A. radicina) by testing naturally infected seed samples and root material. Results of the PCR-assay were similar to those of the blotter method and plating on ARSA for the detection of A. alternata and A. radicina. A positive correlation was found between the percentage of seed infection established by the blotter method and the intensity of the amplified, specific product. The PCR-assay based on the specific primers developed seems to be a good alternative for the deep-freeze-blotter method and plating on ARSA, especially when time is an important issue.","Konstantinova, P; Bonants, PJM; van Gent-Pelzer, MPE; van der Zouwen, P; van den Bulk, R",MYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH,2002,10.1017/S0953756201005160,0.993249384895567,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.943876843661235,0.0561231563387649,0.999336209944934,6.63790055066e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Media-based analyses revealed that fungi colonizing these grasses exhibited similar morphotypes (albeit in different proportions). Conversely, molecular-based analyses suggested that the community of fungal OTUs were dissimilar, with several OTUs commonly present on only one plant and no AMF sequences present in either plant species. When compared to various datasets of RAF obtained from the North American mainland (with similar methods), the Honduran grasses harbored a different set of fungal OTUs. Interestingly, some cosmopolitan taxonomic clades commonly encountered on the mainland were also isolated in Honduras, though based on ITS rDNA the fungi were only related distantly to those on the mainland. Additional work is necessary to determine how the RAF communities change over geographic distance and whether invasive grasses are constitutionally set up to accept relationships with a different suite of RAF species.

3971,Phragmites australis Associates with Belowground Fungal Communities Characterized by High Diversity and Pathogen Abundance,"Microbial symbionts are gaining attention as crucial drivers of invasive species spread and dominance. To date, much research has quantified the net effects of plant-microbe interactions on the relative success of native and invasive species. However, little is known about how the structure (composition and diversity) of microbial symbionts can differ among native and invasive species, or vary across the invasive landscape. Here, we explore the structure of endosphere and soil fungal communities associated with a monoculture-forming widespread invader, Phragmites australis, and co-occurring native species. Using field survey data from marshes in coastal Louisiana, we tested three hypotheses: (1) Phragmites australis root and soil fungal communities differ from that of co-occurring natives, (2) Phragmites australis monocultures harbor distinct fungal communities at the expanding edge compared to the monodominant center, and (3) proximity to the P. australis invading front alters native root endosphere and soil fungal community structure. We found that P. australis cultivates root and soil fungal communities with higher richness, diversity, and pathogen abundances compared to native species. While P. australis was found to have higher endosphere pathogen abundances at its expanding edge compared to the monodominant center, we found no evidence of compositional changes or pathogen spillover in native species in close proximity to the invasion front. This work suggests that field measurements of fungal endosphere communities in native and invasive plants are useful to help understand (or rule out) mechanisms of invasion.","Schroeder, CS; Halbrook, S; Birnbaum, C; Waryszak, P; Wilber, W; Farrer, EC",DIVERSITY-BASEL,2020,10.3390/d12090363,0.89547798940985,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.977163818677584,0.0228361813224157,0.999999996603926,3.3960740886129803e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11932,THE INTEGRATION OF HOST-RESISTANCE WITH FUNGICIDES IN THE CONTROL OF OAT POWDERY MILDEW,"Treatment of seed with the systemic fungicides triadimenol plus fuberidazole as Baytan significantly decreased powdery mildew [Erysiphe graminis f. sp. avenae] in field experiments involving eight oat cultivars differing widely in their resistance to the disease. This was so up to growth stage G.S. 61 (Zadoks) even in a year of high mildew incidence, although the effect diminished after flowering. Significant (P .ltoreq. 0.001) interactions between fungicide treatments and cultivars occurred in each of three years at nearly all assessment times. In years of high mildew incidence (1983 and 1984), susceptible cultivars developed similar levels of mildew in seed-treated and untreated plots by about flowering time, although cultivars with adult plant resistance (APR) had significantly less mildew when seed-treated than when left untreated. Later, as the APR was fully expressed and the fungicide effectiveness was declining, similar mildew levels were recorded on treated and untreated plots. Untreated APR cultivars generally had less mildew than treated susceptible cultivars and in a year of late and light mildew, APR alone provided good protection. Seed treatments combined with foliar sprays of tridemorph as Calixin almost completely controlled mildew except on very susceptible cultivars late in the season in high mildew years. Over all cultivars, seed treatment gave yield advantages of 5.3% (1983) and 6.6% (1984) but in 1982, a year of low mildew, the response was small. The possible influence of integrated host resistance and fungicides in stabilising the pathogen population at economically unimportant levels and the environmental benefit of using host resistance to minimise fungicide usage is discussed.","JONES, IT; RODERICK, HW; CLIFFORD, BC",ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY,1987,10.1111/j.1744-7348.1987.tb04178.x,0.983378094540757,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.821236896564888,0.178763103435112,0.999996915569599,3.08443040131223e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
4523,Endophytic Beauveria bassiana in maize affects survival and fecundity of the aphid Sitobion avenae,"The entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana is able to colonize and establish a symbiotic relationship with plants as an endophyte, naturally as well as through artificial inoculation. This study aims at implementing a reliable and efficient method to establish endophytic B. bassiana in maize plants. The level of the endophytic establishment was evaluated and the survival and fecundity of the English grain aphid (Sitobion avenae) was investigated. Eight-days-old maize plants were sprayed with a fungal spore suspension, while control plants were treated only with a Tween solution. Two weeks after inoculation, seven clip cages per plant, each containing an adult aphid, were attached to different leaves and left for seven days. All inoculated plants contained endophytic B. bassiana as confirmed by plating surface disinfected leaf pieces on selective plates. None of the control plants showed growth of B. bassiana. The highest colonization levels were 61% in older inoculated leaves and 19% in younger non-inoculated leaves. The survival of S. avenae on inoculated plants was reduced up to 49% as compared to control plants. Dead aphids did not show any signs of mycosis. The number of nymphs produced by a single aphid was reduced up to 70% and 74% on inoculated and non-inoculated leaves, respectively. Presence of endophytic B. bassiana in non-inoculated younger leaves implies the movement of the endophyte inside plants. The negative effect on aphid fecundity appears to be systemic as implied by the almost equal reduction of mean numbers of nymphs produced on older and younger leaves on the inoculated plants, irrespective of the level of colonization by endophytic B. bassiana.","Mahmood, Z; Steenberg, T; Mahmood, K; Labouriau, R; Kristensen, M",BIOLOGICAL CONTROL,2019,10.1016/j.biocontrol.2019.104017,0.996745815848566,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.861922408715415,0.138077591284585,0.999999999971604,2.8396396345442596e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

19068,Recent progress in the role of seed endophytic bacteria as plant growth-promoting microorganisms and biocontrol agents.,"The importance of microorganisms residing within the host plant for their growth and health is increasingly acknowledged, yet the significance of microbes associated with seeds, particularly seed endophytic bacteria, remains underestimated. Seeds harbor a wide range of bacteria that can boost the growth and resilience of their host plants against environmental challenges. These endophytic associations also offer advantages for germination and seedling establishment, as seed endophytic bacteria are present during the initial stages of plant growth and development. Furthermore, plants can selectively choose bacteria possessing beneficial traits, which are subsequently transmitted through seeds to confer benefits to future generations. Interestingly, even with the ongoing discovery of endophytes in seeds through high-throughput sequencing methods, certain endophytes remain challenging to isolate and culture from seeds, despite their high abundance. These challenges pose difficulties in studying seed endophytes, making many of their effects on plants unclear. In this article, a framework for understanding the assembly and function of seed endophytes, including their sources and colonization processes was outlined in detail and available research on bacterial endophytes discovered within the seeds of various plant species has also been explored. Thus, this current review aims to provide valuable insights into the mechanism of underlying seed endophytic bacteria-host plant interactions and offers significant recommendations for utilizing the seed endophytic bacteria in sustainable agriculture as plant growth promoters and enhancers of environmental stress tolerance.",Guha T; Mandal Biswas S,World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,2024,10.1007/s11274-024-04031-w,0.906969779019679,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.777634494148027,0.222365505851973,0.999948422969905,5.15770300953955e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
15204,Validity of direct bilateral axillary arterial cannulation in emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection,"Background and Aim of the Study: To assess the validity and long-term outcomes of direct bilateral axillary arterial cannulation for acute type A aortic dissection. Methods: Between 2003 and 2020, 208 consecutive patients with acute type A aortic dissection underwent emergency surgical repair. Cardiopulmonary bypass was attempted to establish direct bilateral axillary arterial cannulation and bicaval drainage. Antegrade selective cerebral perfusion was established by axillary perfusion and direct cannulation of the left common carotid artery. Results: Ascending aortic, partial arch, and extended total aortic arch replacement were performed in 50 (24.0%), 7 (3.4%), and 151 (72.6%) patients, respectively. Aortic root surgery and coronary artery bypass grafting were performed concomitantly in 23 and seven patients, respectively. Cardiopulmonary bypass was attempted only through bilateral axillary cannulation in all patients but was successful in 13 (6.3%) patients without bilateral axillary cannulation. No postoperative complications occurred related to this technique. There were seven hospital deaths (early mortality rate, 3.4%). Five patients had postoperative reoperation for bleeding, and nine (4.3%) were transferred to other hospitals due to postoperative permanent cerebral infarction, particularly two with arm ischemia. The 10-year survival rate of patients who underwent emergency surgical repair with this technique was 71.4%. Conclusions: Direct bilateral axillary arterial cannulation followed by selective cerebral perfusion was successful in 93.7% of patients and this may be an optimal solution for providing stable outcomes after emergency surgery for acute type A aortic dissection. However, we experienced two complications of arm ischemia, attention should be paid to potential arm ischemia. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",Suzuki R.; Kurazumi H.; Nawata R.; Yokoyama T.; Matsunaga K.; Tsubone S.; Matsuno Y.; Tomisada K.; Shirasawa B.; Mikamo A.; Hamano K.,Journal of Cardiac Surgery,2022,10.1111/jocs.17175,0.986129629838591,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.633707711933286,0.366292288066714,0.999991002696367,8.99730363301821e-6,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
4594,Arbuscular mycorrhizal relations of mangrove plant community at the Ganges river estuary in India,"Mangroves are climax formation of hydrohalophytes inhabiting estuarine or marine salt marshes in the tropics and subtropics. As a terrestrial plant community inhabiting tidally inundated estuarine or marine sediments, mangroves show considerable adaptation to salinity, water-logging and nutrient stress. Thirty-one species of mangrove and mangrove associates and 23 species of transported flora, belonging to 25 families at four physiographic stages of succession of the mangrove plant community at the terminal part of the Ganges river estuary in India were examined for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) root association. Dominant members of the mangrove plant community were all AM, mostly with 'Paris' type structures. Many of the known non-mycotrophic plant families, except the Cyperaceae, also showed AM association, with intracellular hyphae and vesicles as the most discernible endophyte structures. Intensity of AM colonization varied both with the species and situations of their occurrence, being more intense and also more extensive in less saline dry ridge mangroves than in more saline formative and developed swamp mangroves. Introduced exotic trees on the ridges and embankments were infected by AM, but less than the declining mangroves in the same location. Seven species of AM fungi in common with those of the upstream mesophytic plants were isolated from root-free rhizosphere soils of the mangroves, three of which predominated in root association. These species, individually and as mixtures, infected roots of salinity tolerant herbs and trees in both locational silt and upstream alluvial soil with obvious improvements in their biomass yield and phosphorus nutrition. AM infective potential of root-free rhizosphere soils of the dominant members of the mangrove community were negatively related to salinity level of the sediment soil of the successional stages. The evidences of AM association of mangroves and other salt marsh plants obtained here and those reported elsewhere are discussed.","Sengupta, A; Chaudhuri, S",MYCORRHIZA,2002,10.1007/s00572-002-0164-y,0.985056995123851,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.84544257075776,0.15455742924224,0.999999598798589,4.0120141098221e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
914,"Mycotrophy in Gilliesieae, a threatened and poorly known tribe of Alliaceae from central Chile","The five known genera of Gilliesieae have their diversity center in the Mediterranean zone of central Chile, where many of their habitats are threatened by urban expansion, industrial and agroforestry activities, as well as other anthropogenic impacts. Very little is known about the biology of these particular geophytes, the majority of which currently have either vulnerable or endangered status, mainly due to their dispersed and small populations generally associated to remnants of native vegetation. As mycorrhizal associations are essential for soil resource acquisition and stress mitigation in most plants, our objective was to assess the hitherto unknown mycotrophic status of ten species of Gilliesieae from central Chile by qualitative and quantitative assessment of intraradical fungal structures. All sampled genera (Gethyum, Gilliesia, Miersia, Solaria, Speea) showed regular presence of arbuscular mycorrhiza, while other mycorrhizal or putatively mutualistic associations, like dark septate endophytes, were practically absent. Mycorrhizal colonization of fine roots reached a mean of ca. 45 % across all examined taxa, with highly variable values ranging from 9 % to 82 % in Miersia tenuiseta and Gilliesia curicana, respectively. The high level of mycorrhization indicates that arbuscular mycorrhiza should be considered for conservation strategies of threatened species or biotechnological use in plant propagation. The main future task is the identification of the associated fungal taxa.","Torres-Mellado, GA; Escobar, I; Palfner, G; Casanova-Katny, MA",REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL,2012,10.4067/S0716-078X2012000200004,0.987841022155456,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997543010722666,0.00245698927733391,0.999999985937205,1.40627949285488e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Its structure has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses and was found to be identical tocyclo(L-Pro-L-Phe) purified from species of other fungal genera. This secondary metabolite has been selected following bioguided-assay fractionation against two strains ofSalmonella enterica, the causal agent of bovine gastroenteritis. The diketopiperazinecyclo(L-Pro-L-Phe), isolated for the first time fromParaphaeosphaeriaspecies, showed minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 71.3 and 78.6 mu g/mL against the twoS.entericastrains. This finding may be significant in limiting the use of synthetic antibiotics in animal husbandry and reducing the emergence of bacterial multidrug resistance.

11447,Diversity of microfungi associated with phyllosphere of endemic Serbian plant Nepeta rtanjensis Diklic & Milojevic,"Nepeta rtanjensis (Lamiaceae) is an endemic and critically endangered plant species that grows only on Rtanj Mountain in the southeastern Serbia. Due to its endemic character and distribution separated from the other Nepeta species in Mediterranean Basin, N. rtanjensis has been considered as a relict. It has been noticed that number of individual plants in natural habitat rapidly decreases. Hence, the project of reintroduction of this plant was successfully conducted. However, many aspects of its biology still remain unknown and necessary to investigate. In that sense, epiphytic and endophytic Nepeta rtanjensis phyllosphere fungi were studied at three sites in Serbia: Javor-Locus classicus, with autochthonous population and with reintroduced plants, and Belgrade with micro-propagated specimens in experimental field. The sites in Javor are located in the area of the Mountain Rtanj. From both, the surface and the interior of leaves, a total of 49 taxa of microfungi were identified, belonging to 35 genera. Alternaria spp. was reported on all studied sites with the highest isolation frequency (>75 %). Similarity between epiphytic and endophytic fungal assemblage was moderate. The highest fungal diversity was detected on site with the autochthonous Nepeta rtanjensis population. Phyllosphere mycobiota show the presence of a large number of viable propagules, with a low frequency of occurrence of symptoms, due to the specific anatomy of the leaf and a well-developed indumentum.","Grbic, ML; Stupar, M; Unkovic, N; Vukojevic, J; Stevanovic, B; Grubisic, D",BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,2015,10.1007/s40415-015-0150-1,0.921629295110522,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.988688932694782,0.0113110673052176,0.999999998703658,1.2963415896294402e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
8459,Plant endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi alter the decomposition of Achnatherum sibiricum litter,"Symbiotic infection with endophytic fungi has been shown to affect the decomposition rate of host plant leaf litter, but whether this effect is influenced by the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) remains unclear. In this study, we placed litterbags with endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) Achnatherum sibiricum leaf litter in experimental microcosms in which three AMF inoculation treatments (Funneliformis mosseae, FM; Claroideoglomus etunicatum, CE; and no AMF, NM) were conducted. We then studied the dynamics of mass and nutrient losses and the soil microbial community during a 300-day decomposition period. The presence of endophytes inhibited A. sibiricum litter decomposition, while AMF significantly enhanced the rate of litter decomposition. The degree of inhibition of endophytes was dependent on the AMF species identity. The presence of endophytes significantly decreased the decomposition rate at later decomposition stages under FM inoculation, while the inhibitory effect of endophytes on litter decomposition was eliminated under CE inoculation. In the presence of endophytes, the ratio of carbon to nitrogen in litter increased, which is usually associated with lower decomposition rates. The effect of endophytes on nitrogen accumulation was also influenced by the host plant AMF status, i.e., endophytes reduced nitrogen loss from litter during decomposition only in the FM inoculation treatment. Endophytes had significant negative effects on the biomass of the soil fungal, bacterial and total microbial communities. Our findings suggest that the presence of endophytes can decrease the decomposition rate of A. sibiricum leaf litter directly by altering litter quality and indirectly by inhibiting soil microbial community development during decomposition. Moreover, this inhibitory effect changes depending on the AMF species present. These results may further our understanding of the interactive effects of these two symbionts on nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration in natural communities.","Zhou, Y; Li, X; Gao, YB; Ren, AZ",APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,2022,10.1016/j.apsoil.2022.104616,0.957711644344008,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.958326821907612,0.041673178092388,0.999999983001709,1.69982914410838e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The maritime Antarctic is very vulnerable to rapid environmental change caused by global warming. The aim of this study was to investigate the importance of bryophytes as a microhabitat for fungal species in the maritime Antarctic by surveying endophytic fungal diversity from several bryophytes including Andreaea sp., Barbilophozia hatcheri, Chorisodontium aciphyllum, Polytrichum alpinum, Polytrichum strictum, Sanionia uncinata, and Warnstorfia sarmentosa. We collected 13 bryophyte samples at four localities on Barton Peninsula, King George Island. In total, 31 endophytic fungi morphotypes were isolated from bryophyte tissues by a thorough surface sterilization method. Using internal transcribed spacer sequence analysis, 16 endophytic fungal strains belonging to Ascomycota (12), Basidiomycota (1), Oomycota (1), and Zygomycota (2) phyla were obtained. Our results suggest the presence of a diverse range of fungal species even in a very limited area, and those bryophytes play an important role in conserving fungal diversity in this harsh environment.

11982,Prevalence of interspecific hybrids amongst asexual fungal endophytes of grasses,"Epichloe endophytes are fungal symbionts of grasses that span a continuum including asexual mutualists that are vertically transmitted, obligately sexual pathogens that are horizontally transmitted, and mixed-strategy symbionts with both mutualistic and pathogenic capabilities. Here we show that processes of genome evolution differ markedly for the different symbiont types. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis was conducted of a broad taxonomic, ecological and geographical sample of sexual and asexual isolates, in which were identified and sequenced alleles of genes for beta-tubulin (tub2) and translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1), and microsatellite alleles were identified by length polymorphisms. The majority of asexual isolates had two or three alleles of most loci, but every sexual isolate had only single alleles for each locus. Phylogenetic analysis of tub2 and tef1 indicated that in all instances of multiple alleles in an isolate, the alleles were derived from different sexual species. It is concluded that, whereas horizontally transmissible species had haploid genomes and speciation occurred cladistically, most of the strictly seedborne mutualists were interspecific hybrids with heteroploid (aneuploid or polyploid) genomes. Furthermore, the phylogenetic evidence indicated that, in at least some instances, hybridization followed rather than caused evolution of the strictly seedborne habit. Therefore, the abundance of hybrid species among grass endophytes, and their prevalence in many host populations suggests a selective advantage of hybridization for the mutualistic endophytes.","Moon, CD; Craven, KD; Leuchtmann, A; Clement, SL; Schardl, CL",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2004,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2004.02138.x,0.961292281311215,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.778298679052768,0.221701320947232,0.999999979148595,2.08514054911291e-8,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

3778,The impact of soil treatments on black pod rot (caused by Phytophthora megakarya) of cacao in Cameroon,"In Cameroon, Phytophthora megakarya is the causal agent of black pod rot of cacao (Theobroma cacao L). Primary inoculum of P. megakarya is located in the soil. With the onset of the rainy season, this primary inoculum is activated and through rain splash cacao pods become infected. From there repeated cycles of pod infection, sporulation, spore dispersal and pod infection, result in losses that can reach up to 70-80% when no control measures are in place. Thus, if this soil-borne inoculum could be eliminated or prevented from reaching cacao pods, losses from black pod could possibly be reduced considerably. Biological control of cacao black pod disease, using Trichoderma asperellum PR11, has proven successful in Cameroon. Moreover, T. asperellum PR11 has also been proven to be useful against soilborne inoculum of Pythium myriotylum and Phytophthora ramorum. The objective of this study therefore, was to use soil applications of T. asperellum PR11 to reduce black pod disease due to P. megakarya. This study was undertaken under farmers' field condition in the Centre region of Cameroon. Trichoderma asperellum PRR11, together with a water and fungicide (Ridomil Gold 66 WP) control, were applied on a three weeks basis over two consecutive production seasons. Weekly data collection consisted of counting healthy and diseased pods. For each treatment six replicate plots, each containing 16 trees, were used. Soil samples were taken at the beginning and end of the second season to determine the impact of the treatments on P. megakarya primary inoculum levels as well as the presence of fungal antagonists of P. megakarya. Although soil applications did not significantly reduce the total number of diseased pods, nor overall pod rot rate, soil applications did change disease dynamics by reducing the speed in which the disease progressed. Moreover, soil applications did impact the presence of fungal antagonists and most importantly significantly reduced the amount of P. megakarya primary inoculum present in the soil. Given the effectiveness of T. asperellum in controlling black pod rot, combined aerial and soil applications should have additive effects when combined simultaneously for the control of black pod disease in cacao.","Ndoungue, M; Petchayo, S; Techou, Z; Nana, WG; Nembot, C; Fontem, D; Hoopen, GMT",BIOLOGICAL CONTROL,2018,10.1016/j.biocontrol.2018.04.016,0.955470937493631,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.989679785075439,0.0103202149245611,1,1.11022302462516e-16,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

PVL1 was isolated using laboratory synthetic media. 16S rRNA gene sequencing method has been employed for identification before and after root colonization ability. Original isolated and remunerated strain from colonized roots were identified as Bacillus spp. as per EzBiocloud database. The presence of bacteria in the root section of the plantlet was confirmed through Epifluorescence microscopy of colonized roots. The in-vitro plantlet colonized by PVL1 as well as DLMB attained higher growth than the control. PVL1 capable of producing plant beneficial phytohormone under in vitro cultivation. HPLC and GC-MS analysis suggest that colonized plants contain Indole Acetic Acid (IAA). The methanol extract of Bacillus spp., contains 0.015 μg in 1 μl concentration of IAA. PVL1 has the ability to produce antimicrobial compounds such as ethyl iso-allocholate, which exhibits immune restoring property.

10888,Dehydrin-like Proteins in the Necrotrophic Fungus Alternaria brassicicola Have a Role in Plant Pathogenesis and Stress Response,"In this study, the roles of fungal dehydrin-like proteins in pathogenicity and protection against environmental stresses were investigated in the necrotrophic seed-borne fungus Alternaria brassicicola. Three proteins (called AbDhn1, AbDhn2 and AbDhn3), harbouring the asparagine-proline-arginine (DPR) signature pattern and sharing the characteristic features of fungal dehydrin-like proteins, were identified in the A. brassicicola genome. The expression of these genes was induced in response to various stresses and found to be regulated by the AbHog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. A knock-out approach showed that dehydrin-like proteins have an impact mainly on oxidative stress tolerance and on conidial survival upon exposure to high and freezing temperatures. The subcellular localization revealed that AbDhn1 and AbDhn2 were associated with peroxisomes, which is consistent with a possible perturbation of protective mechanisms to counteract oxidative stress and maintain the redox balance in AbDhn mutants. Finally, we show that the double deletion mutant Delta Delta abdhn1-abdhn2 was highly compromised in its pathogenicity. By comparison to the wild-type, this mutant exhibited lower aggressiveness on B. oleracea leaves and a reduced capacity to be transmitted to Arabidopsis seeds via siliques. The double mutant was also affected with respect to conidiation, another crucial step in the epidemiology of the disease.","Pochon, S; Simoneau, P; Pigné, S; Balidas, S; Bataillé-Simoneau, N; Campion, C; Jaspard, E; Calmes, B; Hamon, B; Berruyer, R; Juchaux, M; Guillemette, T",PLOS ONE,2013,10.1371/journal.pone.0075143,0.967577598462462,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.980035609355163,0.0199643906448375,0.999996804341827,3.19565817330503e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

11868,"A new highly effective hybrid fungicide containing difenoconazole and tea tree oil for managing scab of apple, pecan and almond trees and as a tool in resistance management","Management of scab diseases of apple, pecan and almond is mostly based on fungicide applications according to host phenological stage and wetness events. Resistance to widely used locally systemic fungicides including the methyl benzimidazoles, demethylation inhibitors (DMIs) and quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs) has been reported. We evaluated the activity of a new premixed hybrid fungicide containing the DMI difenoconazole and essential tea tree oil (TTO) against mycelial growth of Venturia inaequalis in vitro and against scab of apple, pecan and almond in field trials. Mycelial growth of 24 isolates of V. inaequalis collected from commercial apple orchards varied in their sensitivity to difenoconazole (EC50 values of 0.0002-1.29 mg/L). Difenoconazole-TTO was significantly more inhibitory to some of the isolates than difenoconazole alone, primarily to those that were less sensitive to difenoconazole. Protective foliar applications of difenoconazole-TTO in field trials were highly effective in controlling scab of apple and generally provided significantly higher disease control than difenoconazole alone. On apple and almond, difenoconazole-TTO treatments were similarly or more effective than applications with other synthetic fungicides belonging to the DMI, QoI and succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) groups, or their mixtures. Difenoconazole-TTO completely prevented scab on pecan trees. Results suggest that difenoconazole-TTO can be integrated into scab control programmes for these crops and be used as a strategic approach in fungicide resistance management in orchards.","Reuveni, M; Gur, L; Henriquez, JL; Frank, J; Tedford, E; Cloud, G; Adaskaveg, JE",PLANT PATHOLOGY,2022,10.1111/ppa.13610,0.961374283380916,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.976080794052101,0.0239192059478988,0.999999975011634,2.49883660430328e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

341,Plant-endophytic fungi interactions: A strigolactone perspective,"Symbiotic associations between endophytic fungi, hereon referred to as mycoendophytes, and their hosts involve several metabolic and regulatory processes. The exact molecular signal mechanisms that underlie these interactions are largely unidentified. Nevertheless, phytohormones seem to play key roles in the establishment and perpetuation of these symbiotic associations including plant-mycoendophyte symbiosis. Strigolactones, a group of apocarotenoid phytohormones, are known to influence both plant and fungal developmental processes e.g. modulation of host-root parasitic plant interactions and the activation of hyphae growth and branching. However, their role in plant-mycoendophyte interactions remains largely undescribed. Here, we provide a concise synthesis of current scientific knowledge on strigolactone influences in shaping plant-mycoendophyte symbiotic interactions, while also providing some perspective and research directions on critical molecular, physiological and ecological aspects that hold promise to deepen our understanding of this biologically and ecologically significant interaction.

1094,Do fungivores trigger the transfer of protective metabolites from host plants to arbuscular mycorrhizal hyphae?,"A key objective in ecology is to understand how cooperative strategies evolve and are maintained in species networks. Here, we focus on the tri-trophic relationship between arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, host plants, and fungivores to ask if host plants are able to protect their mutualistic mycorrhizal partners from being grazed. Specifically, we test whether secondary metabolites are transferred from hosts to fungal partners to increase their defense against fungivores. We grew Plantago lanceolata hosts with and without mycorrhizal inoculum, and in the presence or absence of fungivorous springtails. We then measured fungivore effects on host biomass and mycorrhizal abundance (using quantitative PCR) in roots and soil. We used high-performance liquid chromatography to measure host metabolites in roots, shoots, and hyphae, focusing on catalpol, aucubin, and verbascoside. Our most striking result was that the metabolite catalpol was consistently found in AM fungal hyphae in host plants exposed to fungivores. When fungivores were absent, catalpol was undetectable in hyphae. Our results highlight the potential for plant-mediated protection of the mycorrhizal hyphal network.","Duhamel, M; Pel, R; Ooms, A; Bücking, H; Jansa, J; Ellers, J; van Straalen, NM; Wouda, T; Vandenkoornhuyse, P; Kiers, ET",ECOLOGY,2013,10.1890/12-1943.1,0.989846693557518,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998094072746983,0.00190592725301745,0.999999999996439,3.5612623960901098e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
7054,Elicitation of gymnemic acid production in cell suspension cultures of Gymnema sylvestre R.Br. through endophytic fungi,"The enhancement of plant secondary metabolite production in cell suspension cultures through biotic or abiotic elicitation has become a potential biotechnological approach for commercialization or large-scale production of bioactive compounds. Gymnema sylvestre R.Br. is an important medicinal plant, rich in a group of oleanane triterpenoid saponins called gymnemic acid, well known for its anti-diabetic activity. Two endophytic fungal strains were isolated from the leaves of G. sylvestre and identified as Polyancora globosa and Xylaria sp. based on the PCR amplification and internal transcribed spacer (ITS 1-5.8S-ITS 2) sequencing of 18S rRNA gene. The process of elicitation of cell suspension cultures of G. sylvestre with dried powder of fungal mycelia (DPFM) and extracellular culture filtrate (ECF) of endophytic fungi consistently enhanced the accumulation of gymnemic acid and the DPFM was proved to be an effective elicitor when compared to the ECF. The DPFM elicited the gymnemic acid content in the range of 2.57-10.45-fold, while the ECF elicited the gymnemic acid content in the range of 2.39-7.8-fold. P. globosa, a novel and a rare endophytic fungal strain, has shown a great influence on the production of gymnemic acid. Cell suspension cultures elicited with DPFM of P. globosa produced higher amount of gymnemic acid content (124.23 mg/g dried cell weight) compared to the cultures elicited with DPFM of Xylaria sp. (102.24 mg/g DCW). But the cultures treated with consortium of DPFM of both fungi showed great influence on the production of gymnemic acid (139.98 mg/g DCW) than the cultures treated with DPFM alone. Similarly, cultures treated with consortium of ECF of both fungi produced more gymnemic acid content (94.86 mg/g DCW) compared with cultures treated with ECF of Xylaria sp. (77.93 mg/g DCW) and ECF of P. globosa (78.65 mg/g DCW) alone.","Netala, VR; Kotakadi, VS; Gaddam, SA; Ghosh, SB; Tartte, V",3 BIOTECH,2016,10.1007/s13205-016-0555-y,0.982987009578484,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995021535002552,0.00497846499744851,0.999999818504873,1.81495127371534e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

A total of twenty-nine endophytic fungal strains along with two nonsporulating forms were isolated from the host plant from three experimental plots. The maximum numbers of fungal strains were found belong to family Aspergillaceae and order Eurotiales. The highest rates of colonization and isolation (p<0.05) of endophytic fungi have been reported in wild foliar explants (95.53±0.53) and monoculture (1.02±0.01), respectively. The highest relative frequency was observed among isolated fungal strains in the case of Lasiodiplodia theobromae isolated from the leaf and root of wild (26.22%) and monoculture (29.62%) explants. In L. theobromae and Aspergillus flavus, isolated from the leaf and roots of wild (21.66%) and monoculture (14.66%) explants showed the highest colonization frequency. Current findings showed that the distribution of fungal endophytes and their relative frequency in host plants vary in three different growing conditions. © 2020, MRF.

16281,Diversity Pattern of Cultivable Endophytic Microbes from Various Parts of Two Cultivars of Indian Spinach: Basella,"Ubiquitous endophytes asymptomatically colonize intra-and intercellular plant tissues through a symbiotic association. These microbes adapt to their environment within the plant’s strict limits, grow, and produce specific compounds that promote the host's growth and maintain a stable symbiosis. Applications of endophytes include the production of pigments, enzymes, antimicrobials, biodegradation/bioremediation, and bioactive compounds that help mankind. A hypothesis could be that microbial diversity depends on the variety of microbes, their association patterns with the host, and the surrounding environment. Our objectives were to isolate, identify, and analyze the diversity of both bacteria and fungi from various parts of Basella alba and Basella rubra plants. We used conventional culture-based methods to grow bacteria and fungi on artificial media from the roots, stems, leaves, fruits, and seeds of B. alba and B. rubra. To identify and sequence the grown organisms, we used Internal Transcribed Sequence (ITS) 1 and 4 and 16S rRNA PCR, followed by Sanger’s sequencing methods. We manually calculated diversity measurements, such as Shannon's and Simpson's indices of diversity and species richness (SChao1). All the endophytic fungi identified belong to the phylum Ascomycetes, with three classes, nine orders, nine families, and 13 genera from B. alba, and three classes, five orders, eight families, and 13 genera from B. rubra. The most common class found was Dothideomycetes, followed by Eurotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes. In the phylum Firmicutes, genus Bacillus was identified from B. alba. From B. rubra, members of the phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were identified. Bacillus was found in greater abundance in the leaf, stem, fruit, and seed, while Achromobacter was predominant in the root, and Clostridium in the leaf. On nutrient agar for bacteria and potato dextrose agar for fungi, 105 cultivable fungi and 49 bacteria were identified.

The number of genera and species, together with their colonization frequency (CF%) in mature teak and rain tree leaves were greater than those in the young leaves. More endophytic isolates in the leaves of both trees were recovered during the rainy season. The fungal genera found in both young and mature teak leaves were Alternaria, Colletotrichum, Nigrospora, Phomopsis and mycelia sterilia. Phomopsis was the dominant genus in both young (newly emerged) and mature leaves. Fusarium, Penicillium, Schizophyllum commune and members of the Xylariaceae were found only in mature leaves. For the rain tree leaves, species of Phomopsis and mycelia sterilia were found in both young newly emerged and mature leaves. Colletotrichum and Penicillium were found only in mature leaves, whereas Nigrospora was found only in young newly emerged leaves. In this study, Phomopsis was the dominant genus in the leaves of both tree species. A total of 37 isolates of endophytic fungi isolated from teak and rain tree leaves were tested for the production of antimicrobial activities. Out of these, 18 isolates could produce inhibitory substances effective against Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli and 3 isolates inhibited growth of Candida albicans in vitro.","Chareprasert, S; Piapukiew, J; Thienhirun, S; Whalley, AJS; Sihanonth, P",WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY,2006,10.1007/s11274-005-9060-x,0.985868343356803,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996055520286859,0.00394447971314084,0.999999933252658,6.6747342319928307e-08,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6681,Production of hydrocarbon compounds by endophytic fungi Gliocladium species grown on cellulose,"Endophytic fungi belonging to the genus Gliocladium are able to degrade plant cellulose and synthesize complex hydrocarbons under microaerophilic conditions. These fungi could thus be used to produce biofuels from cellulosics without the need for hydrolytic pretreatments. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase micro-extraction (GC-MS-SPME) of head space gases from Gliocladium cultures demonstrated the production of C(6)-C(19) hydrocarbons including hexane, benzene, heptane, 3,4-dimethyl hexane, 1-octene, m-xylene, 3-methyl nonane, dodecane, tridecane, hexadecane and nonadecane directly from the cellulosic biomass. Hydrocarbon production was 100-fold higher in co-cultures of Gliocladium and Escherichia coli than in pure Gliocladium cultures. The dry mycelia weight is stable at stationary period in co-culture condition which may lead to synthesize more hydrocarbons. These fungi could potentially be developed into cost-effective biocatalysts for production of biofuels. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

6217,Endophytic Fungi Produce Gibberellins and Indoleacetic Acid and Promotes Host-Plant Growth during Stress,"We isolated and examined two endophytic fungi for their potential to secrete phytohormones viz. gibberellins (GAs) and indoleacetic acid (IAA) and mitigate abiotic stresses like salinity and drought. The endophytic fungi Phoma glomerata LWL2 and Penicillium sp. LWL3 significantly promoted the shoot and allied growth attributes of GAs-deficient dwarf mutant Waito-C and Dongjin-beyo rice. Analysis of the pure cultures of these endophytic fungi showed biologically active GAs (GA(1), GA(3), GA(4) and GA(7)) in various quantities. The cultures of P. glomerata and Penicillium sp. also contained IAA. The culture application and endophytic-association with host-cucumber plants significantly increased the plant biomass and related growth parameters under sodium chloride and polyethylene glycol induced salinity and drought stress as compared to control plants. The endophytic symbiosis resulted in significantly higher assimilation of essential nutrients like potassium, calcium and magnesium as compared to control plants during salinity stress. Endophytic-association reduced the sodium toxicity and promoted the host-benefit ratio in cucumber plants as compared to non-inoculated control plants. The symbiotic-association mitigated stress by compromising the activities of reduced glutathione, catalase, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase. Under stress conditions, the endophyte-infection significantly modulated stress through down-regulated abscisic acid, altered jasmonic acid, and elevated salicylic acid contents as compared to control. In conclusion, the two endophytes significantly reprogrammed the growth of host plants during stress conditions.","Waqas, M; Khan, AL; Kamran, M; Hamayun, M; Kang, SM; Kim, YH; Lee, IJ",MOLECULES,2012,10.3390/molecules170910754,0.902765017451023,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999838088936141,1.6191106385861e-4,0.99999999970948,2.90519719392535e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3820,Soil-plant compartments affect fungal microbiome diversity and composition in grapevine,"Plant compartments provide unique niches that lead to specific microbial associations. The microbiota colonizing the endophytic compartment (endorhizosphere) and the rhizosphere contribute to productivity, plant growth, phytoremediation and carbon sequestration. The main objective of this study was to investigate how fungal communities are enriched in different habitats outside and inside of grapevine roots. For this purpose, the spatial dynamics of the fungal communities associated with three soil-plant compartments (bulk soil, rhizosphere and endorhizosphere) were characterized by ITS high-throughput amplicon sequencing (HTAS). Fungal communities were largely affected in their diversity and composition by soil-plant compartments, whereas the spatial variation (i.e. across five vineyards) was low. The endorhizosphere compartment differed most from the other two, suggesting that the root tissues entail a barrier for fungal colonization. The results of functional prediction via FUNGuild suggested an increase in the relative abundances of potential plant pathogens, endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhiza, and a decrease in wood, dung and undefined saprotrophs from bulk soil towards the endorhizosphere. Roots of asymptomatic vines were a microbial niche that is inhabited by soilborne fungi associated with grapevine trunk diseases, which opens up new perspectives in the study of the endophytic role of these pathogens on grapevines. Results obtained in this study provide helpful information to better know how the host shapes its microbiome and the implications for vineyard productivity and management.

13339,Genetic diversity of Lophodermium piceae in South Finland,"Lophodermium piceae, the dominant needle endophyte of Norway spruce (Picea abies), is known to be extremely diverse. This work aimed to test the possible occurrence of cryptic species within the morphological species L. piceae. Genetic variation in 36 South Finnish L. piceae isolates originating from six localities was investigated by comparing DNA sequences of three genetic markers. One of the markers was the internal transcribed sequence (ITS) of the ribosomal DNA and the other two (LP1 and LP2) were based on sequence characterized amplified regions designed for L. piceae. The LP2 marker could be detected only from isolates of L. piceae but not from 20 other ascomycete species tested. This sequence, therefore, is considered as a species-specific marker for L. piceae. For comparison, ITS sequences of isolates representing two other Lophodermium species, L. pinastri and L. seditiosum, were also investigated. In a neighbor-joining analysis of ITS sequences all L. piceae isolates fell into one cluster, which was clearly separate from those of L. pinastri and L. seditiosum. Dendrograms of the three markers were incongruent indicating that the L. piceae population examined consisted of a single phylogenetic species. No geographical differentiation was observed. Our results confirm that L. piceae is a genetically highly diverse endophytic species. © 2007 The Authors.",Müller M.M.; Valjakka R.; Hantula J.,Forest Pathology,2007,10.1111/j.1439-0329.2007.00504.x,0.96526218464637,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.697671008795175,0.302328991204825,0.999995553366105,4.44663389453925e-6,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
2577,Trichoderma asperellum empowers tomato plants and suppresses Fusarium oxysporum through priming responses,"Plant-associated microbes play crucial roles in plant health and promote growth under stress. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is one of the strategic crops grown throughout Egypt and is a widely grown vegetable worldwide. However, plant disease severely affects tomato production. The post-harvest disease (Fusarium wilt disease) affects food security globally, especially in the tomato fields. Thus, an alternative effective and economical biological treatment to the disease was recently established using Trichoderma asperellum. However, the role of rhizosphere microbiota in the resistance of tomato plants against soil-borne Fusarium wilt disease (FWD) remains unclear. In the current study, a dual culture assay of T. asperellum against various phytopathogens (e.g., Fusarium oxysporum, F. solani, Alternaria alternata, Rhizoctonia solani, and F. graminerarum) was performed in vitro. Interestingly, T. asperellum exhibited the highest mycelial inhibition rate (53.24%) against F. oxysporum. In addition, 30% free cell filtrate of T. asperellum inhibited F. oxysporum by 59.39%. Various underlying mechanisms were studied to explore the antifungal activity against F. oxysporum, such as chitinase activity, analysis of bioactive compounds by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and assessment of fungal secondary metabolites against F. oxysporum mycotoxins in tomato fruits. Additionally, the plant growth-promoting traits of T. asperellum were studied (e.g., IAA production, Phosphate solubilization), and the impact on tomato seeds germination. Scanning electron microscopy, plant root sections, and confocal microscopy were used to show the mobility of the fungal endophyte activity to promote tomato root growth compared with untreated tomato root. T. asperellum enhanced the growth of tomato seeds and controlled the wilt disease caused by the phytopathogen F. oxysporum by enhancing the number of leaves as well as shoot and root length (cm) and fresh and dry weights (g). Furthermore, Trichoderma extract protects tomato fruits from post-harvest infection by F. oxysporum. Taking together, T. asperellum represents a safe and effective controlling agent against Fusarium infection of tomato plants.","Sehim, AE; Hewedy, OA; Altammar, KA; Alhumaidi, MS; Abd Elghaffar, RY",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2023,10.3389/fmicb.2023.1140378,0.991664087211351,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999978702599237,2.1297400762659e-5,0.999999999995086,4.9140691515958695e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The germination of the conidia on the leaves, the penetration and the colonization of the host were stimulated. Fructification of the fungus occurred 12 days after inoculation; the untreated plants, 5 days later. The application of a toxin produced by Helminthosporium sativum caused symptoms identical to those caused by the parasite. The toxin caused stronger pathological reactions on treated than on untreated plants. The growth of radicles was more inhibited, the IAA-content was more reduced, and the ion efflux, the activity of IAA-oxidase and of peroxidase, were higher in treated plants.","SAUR, R",PHYTOPATHOLOGISCHE ZEITSCHRIFT-JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY,1976,NA,0.628636289259129,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.754377009617597,0.245622990382403,0.999998402476844,1.59752315620487e-6,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
3939,Beneficial Soil Microbes Negatively Affect Spider Mites and Aphids in Pepper,"Beneficial soil microbes have long been recognized for their ability to improve plant growth, to antagonize pathogens and to prime plants against biotic stressors. Nevertheless, their ability to enhance plant resistance against arthropod pests remains largely unexplored, especially in crop plants such as pepper. Herein, we assessed the effects of several fungal and bacterial species/strains applied in the soil on the performance of key pests of pepper plants. Specifically, we recorded the impact of pepper inoculation with commercial strains of beneficial bacteria (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Pseudomonas spp.) as well as fungi (Trichoderma spp. and Cordyceps fumosorosea) on the population growth of the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, and the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae. Furthermore, we recorded the effects of microbial inoculation on plant growth parameters, such as stem and root weight. We found that both pests can be negatively affected by microbial inoculation: spider mites laid up to 40% fewer eggs, and the number of aphids were up to 50% less on pepper-inoculated plants, depending on the microbe. We also recorded a variation among the tested microbes in their impact on herbivore performance, but no significant effects were found on plant biomass. Our results add to the growing literature that beneficial soil microbes may be capable of exerting biocontrol capabilities against aboveground herbivorous pests possibly, among other means, via the elicitation of plant defense responses.","Pappas, ML; Samaras, K; Koufakis, I; Broufas, GD",AGRONOMY-BASEL,2021,10.3390/agronomy11091831,0.904065554195557,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.973389139328731,0.0266108606712687,0.999985866988246,1.41330117536809e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18763,The impact of Bisphenol A on the endophytic bacterial community and transcriptome of soybean seedlings.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is widely acknowledged as an endocrine disruptor, and its toxicological effects have garnered considerable research interest. In this investigation, a soil pot experiment was conducted to examine the consequences of sustained BPA exposure on the growth of soybean seedlings, the transcriptome, and the endophytic bacterial community. We observed a substantial inhibition in soybean seedling growth. Transcriptome analysis showed that growth-related genes in both leaves and roots were markedly downregulated following BPA treatment. Intriguingly, BPA considerably increased the abundance and diversity of endophytic bacteria in leaves while suppressing beta diversity in roots. A significant association was identified between amplicon sequence variants and differentially expressed genes under BPA treatment in the leaves and roots.

8520,Effect of Nano Fe-oxide and Endophytic Fungus (P. indica) on Petroleum Hydrocarbons Degradation in an Arsenic Contaminated Soil under Barley Cultivation,"BackgroundHeavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbon pollution are important environmental problems. This research was conducted to evaluate the effect of nano Fe-oxide and endophytic fungus (P. indica) on petroleum hydrocarbons degradation in an arsenic and petroleum hydrocarbons contaminated soil using barley plant.MethodsTreatments consisted of the presence (E+) and the absence (E-) of P.indica fungi, soil contaminated with As in the rates of 0 (AS(0)), 12 (AS(12)) and 24 (As-24) mg As /kg of soil, and application of 0 (Fe-0) and 1% (Fe-1) (W/W) nano Fe-oxide. The plant used in this study was the barley plant. After 7 weeks, the root and shoot As concentration was measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy. The concentration of total soil petroleum hydrocarbon (TPHS) was measured using GC-mass.ResultsApplication of nano Fe-oxide in soil treated with 12 and 24 mg As/kg soil decreased root As concentration by 30 and 20.6%, respectively. The presence of P.indica caused a significant reduction in the shoot As concentration. With increasing shoot Fe concentration the shoot As concentration was decreased. The highest TPHS degradation was observed in non As-polluted soil that containing 1% (W/W) nano Fe-oxide in the presence of P.indica, while the lowest that was in As polluted soil (24 mg As/kg soil) without applying nano Fe-oxide and in the absence of P.indica.ConclusionIncreasing soil sorption properties due to nano Fe-oxide application had significant effect on TPHS degradation in the presence of P.indica. However the role of soil condition on the amount of TPHS degradation cannot be ignored.","Baghaie, AH; Jabari, AG",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,2019,10.1007/s40201-019-00402-w,0.858397422203942,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994650851099431,0.00534914890056855,0.999999876005281,1.23994718936871e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10126,Deletion of the Fungal Gene soft Disrupts Mutualistic Symbiosis between the Grass Endophyte Epichloe festucae and the Host Plant,"Hyphal anastomosis, or vegetative hyphal fusion, establishes the interconnection of individual hyphal strands into an integrated network of a fungal mycelium. In contrast to recent advances in the understanding of the molecular basis for hyphal anastomosis, knowledge of the physiological role of hyphal anastomosis in the natural habitats of filamentous fungi is still very limited. To investigate the role of hyphal anastomosis in fungal endophyte-plant interactions, we generated mutant strains lacking the Epichloe festucae soft (so) gene, an ortholog of the hyphal anastomosis gene so in the endophytic fungus E. festucae. The E. festucae Delta so mutant strains grew similarly to the wild-type strain in culture but with reduced aerial hyphae and completely lacked hyphal anastomosis. The most striking phenotype of the E. festucae Delta so mutant strain was that it failed to establish a mutualistic symbiosis with the tall fescue plant host (Lolium arundinaceum); instead, it killed the host plant within 2 months after the initial infection. Microscopic examination revealed that the death of the tall fescue plant host was associated with the distortion and disorganization of plant cells. This study suggests that hyphal anastomosis may have an important role in the establishment/maintenance of fungal endophyte-host plant mutualistic symbiosis.","Charlton, ND; Shoji, JY; Ghimire, SR; Nakashima, J; Craven, KD",EUKARYOTIC CELL,2012,10.1128/EC.00191-12,0.947741102936622,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999040695564853,9.5930443514696e-4,0.999999999643739,3.56261464773411e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

7519,Ribosomal ITS sequence-directed selection for endophytic Myrothecium strains antagonistic to Ralstonia solanacearum to control patchouli bacterial wilt,"Ralstonia solanacearum (RS) wilt is a soil-borne devastating disease that causes enormous loss to patchouli in tropical and subtropical areas of Asia. The aim of this study was to develop a feasible method to isolate antagonistic fungal endophytes against RS from patchouli and to investigate their effects on biocontrol of patchouli RS wilt. Diversity of endophytic fungi in roots, stems and leaves of healthy patchouli was estimated with Illumina-based sequencing strategies. The number of fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% similarity level was 465, 542 and 298 in roots, stems and leaves, respectively. The most detected genus in patchouli stems and leaves was Aspergillus, while the most dominant genera in roots were Athelia (11.1%) and Myrothecium (10.1%). Due to wide applications of Myrothecium species for biocontrol, 40 isolates of Myrothecium were isolated from patchouli roots using the selection medium for Myrothecium. At the species level, the strain (SWG1) with the most potent activity against RS in vitro was further identified and used to control patchouli RS wilt in vivo. The results of pot experiments showed that fresh weight, dry weight and height of patchouli seedlings inoculated with SWG1 increased by 58.2%, 65.5% and 11.9%, respectively, compared to seedlings without inoculation. The inoculation of SWG1 reduced the disease incidence and disease index of patchouli RS wilt by 66.7% and 71.0%, respectively. The results indicated the directed isolation of antagonistic endophytic fungi based on Illumina sequencing analysis of the ribosomal fungal ITS should be valuable to screen biological agents to control plant diseases.","Shi, WG; Li, JQ; Yao, HX; Li, JB; Chen, MQ; Chen, DT; Fu, YH; Xie, HR; Deng, ZJ",BIOCONTROL,2022,10.1007/s10526-021-10125-3,0.820041048175033,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.877632749421214,0.122367250578786,0.999965144566647,3.48554333533535e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

The present study investigated the antifungal mechanism by which aloe vera extract gel-biosynthesized (AVGE) selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) suppressed Fusarium-induced wilt disease in lettuce (Lactuca sativa). AVGE Se NPs were synthesized by utilizing sodium selenite as a Se source and AVGE as a biocompatible capping and reducing agent. Over 21 d, 2.75% of total AVGE Se NPs was dissolved into Se ions, which was more than 8-fold greater than that of bare Se NPs (0.34%). Upon exposure to soil applied AVGE Se NPs at 50 mg/kg, fresh shoot biomass was significantly increased by 61.6 and 27.8% over the infected control and bare Se NPs, respectively. As compared to the infected control, the shoot levels of citrate, isocitrate, succinate, malate, and 2-oxo-glutarate were significantly upregulated by 0.5-3-fold as affected by both Se NPs. In addition, AVGE Se NPs significantly increased the shoot level of khelmarin D, a type of coumarin, by 4.40- and 0.71-fold over infected controls and bare Se NPs, respectively. Additionally, AVGE Se NPs showed greater upregulation of jasmonic acid and downregulation of abscisic acid content relative to bare Se NPs in diseased shoots. Moreover, the diversity of bacterial endophytes was significantly increased by AVGE Se NPs, with the values of Shannon index 40.2 and 9.16% greater over the infected control and bare Se NPs. Collectively, these findings highlight the significant potential of AVGE Se NPs as an effective and biocompatible strategy for nanoenabled sustainable crop protection. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",Shang H.; Ma C.; Li C.; Cai Z.; Shen Y.; Han L.; Wang C.; Tran J.; Elmer W.H.; White J.C.; Xing B.,ACS Nano,2023,10.1021/acsnano.3c02790,0.964494362982433,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.789659054324981,0.210340945675019,0.999999706578611,2.93421388630755e-7,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

It was supposed that P. liquidambari B3 could enhance the efficiency of nodulation and nitrogen fixation by enriching the diversity of nodular endophytic bacteria under continous monocropping system. To verify this hypothesis, a pot experiment was conducted under natural conditions. Four treatments were set as follow: discontinuous cropping soil (NS), continuous cropping soil (CK), continuous cropping soil inoculate with actived P. liquidambari B3 (CSB3), and continuous cropping soil inoculate with sterilized P. liquidambari B3 (CSIB3). As a result, a total of 120 isolates were obtained. Our study clearly declared that the addition of fungal endophyte effectively enriched the genetic diversity and the community composition in CSB3. In contrast, a low genetic diversity level and simplex community structure were exhibited in CK and CSIB3. Meanwhile, the positive percentage rate and corresponding community composition of the plant growth-promoting isolates in NS and CSB3 were larger and more abundant than the other.

12701,Fungal endophytes from salt- adapted plants confer salt tolerance and promote growth in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) at early seedling stage,"With increasing human global population, increased yield under saline conditions is a desirable trait for major food crops. Use of endophytes, isolated from halophytic hosts, seems to be an exciting approach for conferring salt tolerance to a salt -sensitive crop. Therefore, in the current study, fungal endophytes were isolated from halophytic plants' roots and their ability to withstand in vitro salt stress was evaluated. The fungal endophytes could withstand up to 1M NaCl concentrations and this tolerance was independent of their host or tissue source. When inoculated on salt-sensitive wheat seeds/seedlings, several of the endophytes showed a positive impact on germination and biomass-related parameters upon salt stress, both in vitro and under glasshouse conditions. One of the isolates from dicot plants (identified as Microsphaeropsis arundinis) could successfully colonize wheat and promote its growth under salt and no -salt conditions. Amongst the fungal isolates that are known to be natural endophytes of wheat, Chaetomium globosum was the best performing isolate and has previously been reported to be an effective biocontrol agent.

18201,Bacterial microbiome of root-associated endophytes of Salicornia europaea in correspondence to different levels of salinity.,"The halophytes have evolved several strategies to survive in saline environments; however, an additional support from their associated microbiota helps combat adverse conditions. Hence, our driving interests to investigate the endophytic bacterial community richness, diversity, and composition associated to roots of Salicornia europaea from two test sites with different origins of soil salinity. We assumed that salinity will have a negative effect on the diversity of endophytes but simultaneously will permit the high occurrence of halophylic bacteria. Further, to establish the role of the host and its external environment in determining the endophytic diversity, we analyzed the physico-chemical parameters of root zone soil and the concentration of salt ions in the plant roots. The results based on the Miseq Illumina sequencing approach revealed a higher number of endophytic bacterial OTUs at naturally saline test site with a higher level of soil salinity. Proteobacteria and Bacteriodetes were the dominant endophytic phyla at both analyzed sites; additionally, the high occurrence of Planctomycetes and Acidobacteria at more saline site and the occurrence of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi at less saline site were recorded. The salinity in the root zone soil was crucial in structuring the endophytic community of S. europaea, and the significant prevalence of representatives from the phyla Deltaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Caldithrix, Fibrobacteres, and Verrucomicrobia at the more saline test site suggest domination of halophylic bacteria with potential role in mitigation of salt stress of halophytes.",Szymańska S; Borruso L; Brusetti L; Hulisz P; Furtado B; Hrynkiewicz K,Environmental science and pollution research international,2018,10.1007/s11356-018-2530-0,0.941140021701695,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.976579170887752,0.0234208291122479,0.999997698518823,2.30148117708051e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
21068,Fungal endophytes associated with some thermo-tolerant plants in salt-stress ecosystems,"The ecological fitness of plants growing in harsh ecosystem possibly could be affected by the presence of endophytes. During June 2016, the 35 asymptomatic plants were collected from extremely hot deserts and dry saltmarshes around Abadan, southwestern Iran and surveyed for the endophytic fungi. A total of 59 fungal isolates were recovered and subjected to morphological and DNA analysis. The mycelial biomass was produced and freeze-dried for DNA extraction. The regions of internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 and intervening 5.8S nrDNA (ITS), partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1α) and partial RNA polymerase II (rpb2) were amplified and sequenced. On the basis of their morphological characters, in combination with DNA analysis and multi-locus phylogeny, the isolates were identified as Alternaria sene-cionicola, A. alternata, Exserohilum gedarefense and Cladosporium sp. The topology of a phylogenetic tree constructed based on combined sequences of ITS, tef1á and rpb2 regions showed that the isolates of A. alternata generated a distinct and well-supported clade, while the isolates of A. senecionicola clustered with three other species, including A. geophila, A. cerealis and A arborescens. The low diversity of endophytic fungi detected in this study support the hypothesis that harsh ecosystems limit the species richness of fungal endophytes.

A total number of 100 seeds and 100 cubes (1 cm3) obtained from the fruits (10 pieces per plate) were put on wet filter paper and incubated at 25°C to allow the growth of fungi for a period of 1 week. Fungal species developed on seeds and fruit pieces were isolated on potato dextrose agar for identification. This study was carried out during year from May 2007 to April 2008. Twenty species from 14 genera of fungi have been isolated from 13 different varieties of date-palm as seed-borne fungi while 39 species of 16 genera of fungi were isolated as fruit spoilage fungi. Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Fusarium oxysporum and F. solani were the predominant species in both seed-borne and fruit spoilage fungi. © 2009 Academic Journals Inc.",Al-Sheikh H.,Research Journal of Microbiology,2009,10.3923/jm.2009.208.213,0.905749325003653,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997904107652732,0.00209589234726775,0.99999999999834,1.6604495556293799e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10141,Fungal endophyte protects Atractylodes lancea from root rot caused by Fusarium oxysporum,"Endophytic fungi, which stimulate a variety of defence reactions in host plants without causing visible disease symptoms, have been isolated from almost every plant. However, beneficial interactions between fungal endophytes and pathogens from the same habitat remain largely unknown. An inoculation of Atractylodes lancea plantlets with Gilmaniella sp. AL12 (AL12) prior to infection with Fusarium oxysporum prevented the necrotization of root tissues and plant growth retardation commonly associated with fusarium root rot. Quantification of F. oxysporum infections using real-time PCR revealed a correlation between root rot symptoms and the relative amount of fungal DNA. Pretreatment with AL12 reduced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species stimulated by F. oxysporum. An in vitro analysis of their interactions under axenic culture conditions showed AL12 could inhibit F. oxysporum growth. Additionally, F. oxysporum infections were shown to decrease salicylic acid (SA) production compared with control plantlets. SA biosynthesis inhibitors, 2-aminoindan-2-phosphonic acid and paclobutrazol, abolished the inhibition of F. oxysporum growth in A. lancea even after inoculation with AL12. The results indicated that the fungal endophyte protected A. lancea not only by direct antibiosis, but also by reversing the F. oxysporum-mediated suppression of SA production.","Ren, CG; Chen, F; Dai, CC",PLANT PATHOLOGY,2017,10.1111/ppa.12567,0.980722816714,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995667815183492,0.00433218481650767,0.999442077490929,5.5792250907083e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The entophytic bacterial community structure and diversity were investigated by PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). The results showed that the diversity and community structure of endophytic bacteria in T. matsutake varied significantly, while those from the environments alike had high similarity. In addition, each T. matsutake sample contained more than 15 species of endophytes, with that from Yanyuan having the highest endophytes diversity index and abundance, while those from Xiaojin were the lowest. Phylogenetic tree showed that endophytic bacterial species in T. matsutake were abundant. Dominant bacterial population in T. matsutake collected from different places varied, and Pseudomonas, Ewingella and Bacillus were distributed in all samples and retained a certain advantage. Alcaligenes and Sphingobacterium distributed in most samples, while Duganella and Lysinibacillus only in certain ones.

20525,Fungi pathogenic on wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum L.) in northern Tunisia as potential biocontrol agents,"The distribution and life cycle of wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum L.) and a survey of the pathogens of this plant are reported for the northern regions of Tunisia. Wild radish is a common weed of cereal crops and legumes. It germinates in early autumn (October), develops a rosette stage in November to December after which stem growth, flowering and pod production occur through to May, with pod maturity completed in June. Fungus isolation from the foliar tissues exhibiting disease symptoms showed that wild radish was infected with the fungi Albugo candida, Alternaria spp. including A. brassicicola, and A. raphani, Erysiphe cruciferarum, Stemphylium herbarum, Peronospora parasitica and Phoma lingam. Ascochyta spp., Cercospora armoraciae, Cladosporium cladosporioides and Colletotrichum higginsianum are here reported from wild radish for the first time. Inoculation tests of pathogens on wild radish plants showed that the most injurious fungi were Alternaria raphani and Phoma lingam. The remaining pathogens were weakly to moderately aggressive on this weed. To access the pathogenic effect of fungi spontaneously infecting natural populations of wild radish, the weed was grown in a field experiment with and without the broad-spectrum systemic fungicide Carbendazim. Results showed a statistically significant two-fold decrease in the number and weight of seed pods in the non-treated plants, indicating that the reproductive potential of wild radish was naturally reduced by fungal infection. Foliar pathogenic fungi have a potential in the integrated weed management of wild radish, this role merits further investigations.","Djébali, N; Scott, JK; Jourdan, M; Souissi, T",PHYTOPATHOLOGIA MEDITERRANEA,2009,NA,0.866053612767111,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.738966367946751,0.261033632053249,0.995587567782659,0.00441243221734111,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
7612,Effects of a Dark Septate Fungal Endophyte on the Growth and Physiological Response of Seedlings to Drought in an Epiphytic Orchid,"Dark septate endophytes (DSE) are a group of facultative biotrophic root-colonizing fungi that live within a plant for a part of their life cycle without causing any apparent, overt negative effects. These fungi have been found in >600 different plant species, including orchids. Although the precise ecological functions of dark septate fungal endophytes are not yet well understood, there is increasing evidence that they enhance host growth and nutrient acquisition, and improve the plant's ability to tolerate biotic and abiotic stresses. In this research, we tested the effects of a DSE isolated from the roots of the epiphytic orchid Coelogyne viscosa on the growth and drought tolerance of orchid seedlings. Our results showed that addition of DSE inoculum significantly enhanced biomass of seedlings and increased the activities of drought resistance related enzymes and the accumulation of osmoregulatory substances. These results suggest that DSE can fulfill important ecological functions in stressful environments and potentially play an important role in the life cycle of epiphytic orchids.","Liu, N; Jacquemyn, H; Liu, Q; Shao, SC; Ding, G; Xing, XK",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2022,10.3389/fmicb.2022.961172,0.907899487944436,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994777922957786,0.00522207704221412,0.999999999969134,3.0865532352208896e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15549,Microbe-dependent heterosis in maize,"Hybrids account for nearly all commercially planted varieties of maize and many other crop plants because crosses between inbred lines of these species produce first-generation [F1] offspring that greatly outperform their parents. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, called heterosis or hybrid vigor, are not well understood despite over a century of intensive research. The leading hypotheses—which focus on quantitative genetic mechanisms (dominance, overdominance, and epistasis) and molecular mechanisms (gene dosage and transcriptional regulation)—have been able to explain some but not all of the observed patterns of heterosis. Abiotic stressors are known to impact the expression of heterosis; however, the potential role of microbes in heterosis has largely been ignored. Here, we show that heterosis of root biomass and other traits in maize is strongly dependent on the belowground microbial environment. We found that, in some cases, inbred lines perform as well by these criteria as their F1 offspring under sterile conditions but that heterosis can be restored by inoculation with a simple community of seven bacterial strains. We observed the same pattern for seedlings inoculated with autoclaved versus live soil slurries in a growth chamber and for plants grown in steamed or fumigated versus untreated soil in the field. In a different field site, however, soil steaming increased rather than decreased heterosis, indicating that the direction of the effect depends on community composition, environment, or both. Together, our results demonstrate an ecological phenomenon whereby soil microbes differentially impact the early growth of inbred and hybrid maize. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

13987,Fungal endophytes from medicinal plants: growth promotion in Oryza sativa L. and Cicer arietinum L.,"In the present investigation, four endophytic fungi were isolated from two medicinal plants from two medicinal plants and identified using molecular technique and tested the efficacy of four isolates on the growth of Cicer arietinum and two varieties of rice (Sarath and Gomati). The molecular characterization using amplification of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of fungal ribosomal DNA (rDNA) reveals four fungi namely Diaporthe phaseolorum, Penicillium oxalicum, Fusarium sp. and Syncephalastrum monosporum. The efficacy of isolates on the growth of plants indicated that there was significant increase in shoot length, root length and shoot dry weight with inoculation of D. phaseolorum, P. oxalicum and Fusarium sp. on Sarath variety of rice. Significant increase in shoot length and root dry weight was observed in Gomati rice variety with the inoculation of D. phaseolorum, P. oxalicum and Fusarium sp. Again there was significant increase in root length, shoot dry weight and root dry weight with inoculation of D. phaseolorum, P. oxalicum and Fusarium sp. on the growth of C. arietinum. However, no significant difference was observed between S. monosporum and uninoculated treatment on the growth of rice variety Gomati and C. arietinum.

10012,Integrative Taxonomy of Novel Diaporthe Species Associated with Medicinal Plants in Thailand,"During our investigations of the microfungi on medicinal plants in Thailand, five isolates of Diaporthe were obtained.

Five new species, Diaporthe afzeliae, D. bombacis, D. careyae, D. globoostiolata, and D. samaneae, are introduced as saprobes from the plant hosts, viz. Afzelia xylocarpa, Bombax ceiba, Careya sphaerica, a member of Fagaceae, and Samanea saman. Interestingly, this is the first report of Diaporthe species on these plants, except on the Fagaceae member. The morphological comparison, updated molecular phylogeny, and pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) analysis strongly support the establishment of novel species. Our phylogeny also revealed the close relationship between D. zhaoqingensis and D. chiangmaiensis; however, the evidence from the PHI test and DNA comparison indicated that they are distinct species. These findings improve the existing knowledge of taxonomy and host diversity of Diaporthe species as well as highlight the untapped potential of these medicinal plants for searching for new fungi.","Monkai, J; Hongsanan, S; Bhat, DJ; Dawoud, TM; Lumyong, S",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2023,10.3390/jof9060603,0.920510283635402,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999998108877503,1.89112249747709e-6,0.999999999999701,2.9942714974140497e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
20521,"IN VITRO NEMATICIDAL EFFECT OF ENDOPHYTIC FUSARIUM OXYSPORUM AGAINST RADOPHOLUS SIMILIS, PRATYLENCHUS GOODEYI AND HELICOTYLENCHUS MULTICINCTUS","Endophytic fungi colonize most plants, causing no damage to their hosts, and often extending benefits, such as enhanced protection against various biotic and abiotic constraints. In the current study, three experiments assessed the activity of secondary metabolites of three strains of endophytic Fusarium oxysporum (Emb2.4o, Eny1.31i and V5w2) against the banana (Musa spp.) root-parasitic nematodes Radopholus similis, Pratylenchus goodeyi and Helicotylenchus multicinctus under different laboratory procedures. All experiments showed higher nematode mortality after 24 h exposure for each endophyte culture filtrate compared to control treatments after 24 h exposure. Helicotylenchus multicinctus was less sensitive to endophytic treatments than R. similis and P. goodeyi; and R. similis was more sensitive than P. goodeyi to strain V5w2 even at lower filtrate concentrations. Based on motility of R. similis and P. goodeyi, light (14 L: 10 D h) had no significant effect on endophyte culture filtrates (Emb2.4o and V5w2). These results indicate the potential of endophytic F. oxysporum as an environmentally sensitive management strategy for a range of plant-parasitic nematodes on banana, although more detail is required on the identification of the toxic metabolites involved.","Van Dessel, P; Coyne, D; Dubois, T; De Waele, D; Franco, J",NEMATROPICA,2011,NA,0.943848196399394,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Absence,0.298087432861302,0.701912567138698,0.999715872302486,2.8412769751429e-4,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
14984,Lipidome of the Brown Macroalga Undaria pinnatifida: Influence of Season and Endophytic Infection,"An analysis of the lipidome of the brown alga Undaria pinnatifida (Laminariales) was performed’ more than 900 molecular species were identified in 12 polar lipids and 1 neutral lipid using HPLC/MS-MS. The seasonal changes of U. pinnatifida lipidome were determined. It was shown that acclimatization to winter and spring was accompanied by an increase in the unsaturation of both polar and neutral lipids. In autumn and summer, on the contrary, the contents of more saturated molecular species of all lipid classes increased. Based on the data obtained, a scheme for the polar and neutral lipid synthesis in brown algae was proposed. In addition, the influence of infection with the brown filamentous endophyte Laminariocolax aecidioides (Ectocarpales) on U. pinnatifida lipidome was studied. It was found that infection has the most noticeable effect on the molecular species composition of triacylglycerides, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylhydroxyethylglycine of the host macrophyte. In infected samples of algae, changes in the composition of triacylglycerides were revealed both in areas with the presence of an endophyte and in adjacent intact tissues, which may indicate the occurrence of a secondary infection. © 2023 by the authors.",Chadova K.; Velansky P.,Marine Drugs,2023,10.3390/md21090466,0.878332197078438,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.731516017076453,0.268483982923547,0.999986689905225,1.33100947753428e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
18185,Bacterial Production of Indole Related Compounds Reveals Their Role in Association Between Duckweeds and Endophytes.,"Duckweed farming can be a sustainable practice for biofuel production, animal feed supplement, and wastewater treatment, although large scale production remains a challenge. Plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) have been shown to improve plant health by producing phytohormones such as auxin. While some of the mechanisms for plant growth promotion have been characterized in soil epiphytes, more work is necessary to understand how plants may select for bacterial endophytes that have the ability to provide an exogenous source of phytohormones such as auxin. We have isolated and characterized forty-seven potentially endophytic bacteria from surface-sterilized duckweed tissues and screened these bacterial strains for production of indole related compounds using the Salkowski colorimetric assay. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), and indole produced by various bacterial isolates were verified by mass spectrometry. Using the Salkowski reagent, we found that 79% of the isolated bacterial strains from our collection may be capable of producing indole related compounds to various extents during in vitro growth. Of these bacteria that are producing indole related compounds, 19% are additionally producing indole. There is an apparent correlation between the type of indole related compound produced by a particular bacteria and the duckweed genus from which the bacterial strain is derived. These results suggest the possible association between different duckweed genera and endophytes that are producing distinct types of secondary metabolites. Understanding the role of indole related compounds during interaction between endophytes and the plant host may be useful to help design synthetic bacterial communities that could target specific or multiple species of duckweed in the future to sustainably enhance plant growth.",Gilbert S; Xu J; Acosta K; Poulev A; Lebeis S; Lam E,Frontiers in chemistry,2018,10.3389/fchem.2018.00265,0.959067135779024,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.92883430549418,0.0711656945058198,0.999999527716799,4.72283201213841e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3300,Persistence of plant-mediated microbial soil legacy effects in soil and inside roots,"Plant-soil feedbacks are shaped by microbial legacies that plants leave in the soil. We tested the persistence of these legacies after subsequent colonization by the same or other plant species using 6 typical grassland plant species. Soil fungal legacies were detectable for months, but the current plant effect on fungi amplified in time. By contrast, in bacterial communities, legacies faded away rapidly and bacteria communities were influenced strongly by the current plant. However, both fungal and bacterial legacies were conserved inside the roots of the current plant species and their composition significantly correlated with plant growth. Hence, microbial soil legacies present at the time of plant establishment play a vital role in shaping plant growth even when these legacies have faded away in the soil due the growth of the current plant species. We conclude that soil microbiome legacies are reversible and versatile, but that they can create plant-soil feedbacks via altering the endophytic community acquired during early ontogeny. Legacies of past plant communities are likely to influence plant-soil interactions. Here, the authors report a reciprocal transplant experiment showing that soil microbial legacies shaped by previous plants persist for soil fungi and root endophytes but can be reversed by a next generation of plants for soil bacteria.","Hannula, SE; Heinen, R; Huberty, M; Steinauer, K; De Long, JR; Jongen, R; Bezemer, TM",NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,2021,10.1038/s41467-021-25971-z,0.89725730159303,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.876362953087392,0.123637046912608,0.99999933628766,6.6371234042073e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

On the basis of the evidence presented in this study, strain ISE14T can be distinguished from closely related species belonging to the genus Chryseobacterium. Thus, strain ISE14T is a novel species of the genus Chryseobacterium, for which the name Chryseobacteriumphosphatilyticum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is ISE14T (=KACC 19820T=JCM 32876T).",Jeong JJ; Sang MK; Lee DW; Choi IG; Kim KD,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology,2019,10.1099/ijsem.0.003091,0.935096334342978,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.970838551840693,0.0291614481593073,0.999999934868392,6.51316081068387e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15252,Dereplication of Cytochalasans and Octaketides in Cytotoxic Extracts of Endophytic Fungi from Casearia arborea (Salicaceae),"Endophytes have been shown to be a source of novel drug prototypes. The Casearia genus is known for presenting cytotoxic clerodane diterpenes; however, there are few reports on secondary metabolites produced by its fungal microbiota. Thus, in the present study endophytic fungi obtained from the fresh leaves of C. arborea were grown in potato dextrose broth and rice to perform a secondary metabolite prospection study. The cytotoxic profile of the crude extracts at 10 µg/mL was determined by a colorimetric assay on tumor cell lines. The endophytes producing cytotoxic extracts were identified through phylogenetic analysis and belong to Diaporthe and Colletotrichum species. Metabolites present in these extracts were organized in molecular networking format based on HRMS-MS, and a dereplication process was performed to target compounds for chromatographic purification. Metabolic classes, such as lipids, peptides, alkaloids, and polyketides were annotated, and octaketide and cytochalasin derivatives were investigated. Cytochalasin H was purified from the cytotoxic Diaporthe sp. CarGL8 extract and its cytotoxic activity was determined on human cancer cell lines A549, MCF-7, and HepG2. The data collected in the present study showed that molecular networking is useful to understand the chemical profile of complex matrices to target compounds, minimizing the cost and time spent in purification processes. © 2022 by the authors.",Santos A.L.; Ionta M.; Horvath R.O.; Soares M.G.; Silva D.O.; Kawafune E.S.; Ferreira M.J.P.; Sartorelli P.,Metabolites,2022,10.3390/metabo12100903,0.97968770782802,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.899652116291525,0.100347883708475,0.999942565999426,5.74340005743412e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
13787,Accumulation of systemic fungicides and other solutes by haustorial complexes isolated from Pisum sativum infected with Erysiphe pisi,"Haustorial complexes, isolated from pea leaves infected with powdery mildew, were incubated with individual 14C‐labelled systemic fungicides or other solutes, and the accumulation of these compounds by the complexes was assessed following filter centrifugation of the products through silicone oil. Inulincarboxylic acid and butyric acid were not absorbed; glucose, sucrose, acetic acid and glycerol were absorbed very slowly by the complexes. All the systemic fungicides, which included nuarimol, fenarimol, dimethirimol, ethirimol, and other pyrimidine‐based analogues, were accumulated against large concentration gradients (30‐1500 fold). The fatty acids, linoleic and lauric, were also readily accumulated. The accumulation of the fatty acids and fungicides was usually complete within 5–15 min. The degree of accumulation of all the solutes was significantly correlated with their lipophilicity, indicating that partitioning of compounds into sub‐cellular lipids was the major mechanism determining accumulation by the complexes. The cations 2‐hydroxyethylarnmonium and 1‐methylpyridinium were also accumulated against large concentration gradients (18‐and 46‐fold, respectively) but less rapidly than the fungicides. The significance of these findings for the systemic distribution and mode of action of fungicides is discussed.

1165,Root-associated fungi not tree density influences stand nitrogen dynamics at the larch forest-tundra ecotone,"Greater tree density and forest productivity at the tundra-taiga ecotone (TTE) are expected with climate warming, with potential feedbacks to the climate system. Yet, competition for nitrogen (N) may impact TTE dynamics. Greater tree density will likely increase N demand, while reducing N supply through soil shading and slower decomposition rates. We explored whether characteristics of roots and root-associated fungi important to N acquisition responded to changes in density at the TTE and were related to above-ground stand productivity and N cycling. We measured rooting depth, uptake of N forms among soil layers and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) colonization and composition along a natural tree density gradient of monodominant larch Larix cajanderi in northeastern Siberia. We tested relationships between larch root and fungal characteristics, above-ground productivity and stand-level N cycling parameters. Overall, there was preferential uptake of ammonium compared to glycine or nitrate. Nitrogen uptake was greatest in shallow soils of the organic horizon and related to root chemistry, root-associated fungi and above-ground N cycling parameters, but the direction of these relationships depended on N form. Uptake of different N forms, rooting depth and EcM colonization and composition were not related to tree density, but fungal composition was correlated with root N chemistry and above-ground N cycling parameters. In addition to EcM, the abundance of dark septate endophytes and other ascomycetous taxa was positively related to N uptake and above-ground N cycling parameters. Synthesis. There was little impact of tree density on root and fungal parameters related to N acquisition suggesting intraspecific larch competition for N was not amplified with increased density. There was, however, a strong impact of root-associated fungi on N uptake and stand N dynamics regardless of tree density. Together, this suggests an important role of root-associated fungi on broadscale patterns of N cycling in TTE larch forests independent of changes in tree density expected with climate warming.","Hewitt, RE; Alexander, HD; Miller, SN; Mack, MC",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2022,10.1111/1365-2745.13882,0.978771565954186,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999846985569832,1.530144301684e-4,0.999999999955826,4.4173886770693097e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16416,Diversity and Antimicrobial Activity of Endophytic Fungi Associated with Houttuynia cordata Thunb,"The study focused on the endophytic fungi associated with Houttuynia cordata Thunb., also known as Fish mint, from four districts of Assam, India. This plant is widely used in traditional medicine to treat various ailments such as dysentery, cold, fever, mumps, etc. The investigation aimed to isolate and identify these fungi from healthy plant tissues and to assess their antimicrobial properties. Sixty-one endophytic fungal isolates were obtained from the leaf, stem, and root tissues of H. cordata. The highest fungal population was recorded in samples from North Lakhimpur district, followed by Nagaon and Kamrup (M) districts. Among the isolated fungi, one particular strain of Trichoderma obtained from Nagaon district showed significant antifungal activity against six test fungal pathogens in vitro. The fungal species was further identified as Trichoderma virens strain MBDM1 through 28S rDNA sequence analysis and molecular phylogeny. The ethyl acetate extract of T. virens was analyzed using GC-MS, revealing the presence of six fungicidal metabolites: 1-H-benzotriazol, Trans,cis-1,7-dimethylspiro[4.5]decane, 2H-Pyrane-2-one-tetrahydro-6-pentyl 4-nitro-, 8-decanoic acid, Thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazol-3(2H)- one and Cyclotrisiloxane hexamethyl. These compounds are likely responsible for the antifungal activity against the test fungal pathogens. © 2024 KRF",Swargiary D.; Saikia A.; Jaiswal M.; Goyary S.; Barthakur M.,Biopesticides International,2024,10.59467/BI.2024.20.213,0.921191806524135,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.964493735377611,0.0355062646223886,0.99977887198746,2.2112801254037e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15774,Inducing secondary metabolite production from Daldinia eschscholzii JC-15 by red ginseng medium,"Red ginseng (RG) is one of the most popular herbal medicines and used as a dietary supplement in recent years. The bioactive ingredient in RG can induce the production of novel microbial metabolite from fermented RG. Using the one strain-many compounds strategy, the reinvestigation of the metabolites from Daldinia eschscholzii JC-15 cultured in red ginseng medium led to the isolation of an unprecedented benzopyran-naphthalene hybrid, daldinsin (1) and a new lactone (2). In this research, a new lactone, 8-hydroxylhelicascolide A (2) instead of helicascolide A was produced by the D. eschscholzii JC-15 induced by the red ginseng medium. Compound 1 showed anti-acetylcholinesterase activity with the inhibition ratio of 38.8% at 50 μM. Compound 2 indicated antimicrobial activities against Fusarium Solani, F. oxysporum, and Escherichia coli with MICs at 128 μg/mL. RG is therefore a promising activator in production of novel microbial metabolite. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Wang B.-Y.; Yang Y.-B.; Yang X.-Q.; Zhu C.-H.; Yang S.; Xu T.-T.; Wang X.-Y.; Tan N.-H.; Zhou H.; Ding Z.-T.,Natural Product Research,2020,10.1080/14786419.2019.1610751,0.983173371787539,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999058186171083,9.4181382891698e-4,0.999999999997805,2.19513296428886e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15795,"Comparative transcriptome profiling of rice colonized with beneficial endophyte, Piriformospora indica, under high salinity environment","The salinity stress tolerance in plants has been studied enormously, reflecting its agronomic relevance. Despite the extensive research, limited success has been achieved in relation to the plant tolerance mechanism. The beneficial interaction between Piriformospora indica and rice could essentially improve the performance of the plant during salt stress. In this study, the transcriptomic data between P. indica treated and untreated rice roots were compared under control and salt stress conditions. Overall, 661 salt-responsive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected with 161 up- and 500 down-regulated genes in all comparison groups. Gene ontology analyses indicated the DEGs were mainly enriched in “auxin-activated signaling pathway”, “water channel activity”, “integral component of plasma membrane”, “stress responses”, and “metabolic processes”. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed that the DEGs were primarily related to “Zeatin biosynthesis”, “Fatty acid elongation”, “Carotenoid biosynthesis”, and “Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites”. Particularly, genes related to cell wall modifying enzymes (e.g. invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitor protein and arabinogalactans), phytohormones (e.g. Auxin-responsive Aux/IAA gene family, ent-kaurene synthase, and 12-oxophytodienoate reductase) and receptor-like kinases (e.g. AGC kinase and receptor protein kinase) were induced in P. indica colonized rice under salt stress condition. The differential expression of these genes implies that the coordination between hormonal crosstalk, signaling, and cell wall dynamics contributes to the higher growth and tolerance in P. indica-inoculated rice. Our results offer a valuable resource for future functional studies on salt-responsive genes that should improve the resilience and adaptation of rice against salt stress. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Nivedita; Gazara R.K.; Khan S.; Iqrar S.; Ashrafi K.; Abdin M.Z.,Molecular Biology Reports,2020,10.1007/s11033-020-05839-z,0.958213174594537,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.87535034734383,0.12464965265617,0.999999998276108,1.7238920291262602e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

11757,"Endophytic association of bioactive and halotolerant Humicola fuscoatra with halophytic plants, and its capability of producing anthraquinone and anthranol derivatives","Halophytic plants growing in harsh desert environments are rich reservoirs of unique endophytic microorganisms. Here, healthy fresh plants of the families Tamaricaceae and Amarantaceae at three saline locations in Iran were investigated for their bioactive endophytic fungi. Among a vast number of isolates, eight isolates were identified as Humicola fuscoatra (Sordariomycetes, Pezizomycotina, Ascomycota) by microscopy and representative DNA sequences of the 5.8S rDNA (ITS) and partial beta-tubulin (TUB2). Those isolates were halotolerant, and highly bioactive, so that their intra- and extra-cellular metabolites possessed in vitro antifungal, antibacterial and antiproliferative activities, against a number of fungal and bacterial plant pathogens including the fungi Arthrobotrys conoides, Pyrenophora graminea, Pyricularia grisea and the bacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas oryzae. Chemical analyses of metabolites from the endophytes using HNMR, CNMR, NOESY, COSY, HMBC, HSQC, DEPT, TOCSY and EI MASS techniques identified 3,8-dihydroxy-1-methyl-9,10-anthracenedione (aloesaponarin II; an anthraquinone derivative), 1,8,9-anthracenetriol structure (chrysarobin; an anthranol derivative) and 2,4-di-tert-butylthiophenol in fungal extracts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of endophytic association of halotolerant H. fuscoatra isolates with Tamaricaceae and Amarantaceae, and their bioactivity against plant pathogens. Also, the capability of chrysarobin and aloesaponarin II production is new to the fungal kingdom.

14308,Analysis on the Characteristics of Endophytic Fungi and Mineral Nutrient of Vaccinium uliginosum in the Daxing'an Mountains,"Objective: This study was investigated endophytic fungi diversity, infection rate, infection structure, and host mineral nutrient content to understond the effects of endophytic fungi colonization on the mineral nutrition of V. uliginosum. Method: This study was conducted in the Daxing'an Mountains area with three soil types: Mountain land type, Meadow bog permafrost soil layer type, Meadow bog with soil layer type. The diversity of root mycorrhizal fungi of V. uliginosum was analyzed by modern biological techniques (ITS). Multivariate statistical analysis was used to study the relationship between mycorrhizal colonization and host plant mineral nutrition. Result: 1) The diversity of endophytic fungi (H'=3.58~4.36) and infection structure (exogenous mycelium, intracellular hyphae with partition, intracellular nonseptate hyphae group, intracellular hyphae, missing of the epidermal cells) were rich, the infection rate was high (54.98%~68.09%) on V. uliginosum roots in the Greater Xing'an Mountains. The endophytic fungi in the root system of V. uliginosum in different site types had the specificity. Among them, the mountain land type and the meadow bog with soil layer type were dominated by Phialocephala, while the dominant species of the meadow bog permafrost soil layer type was Meliniomyces. 2) Among the three site types, the endophytic fungi diversity and infection rate were the highest in the meadow bog permafrost soil layer type, followed by the mountain land type, and the meadow bog with soil layer type was lowest. The content of most mineral elements in the three site types showed the same trend as that root endophytic fungi diversity and infection rate, with the exception of Zn element in V. uliginosum. 3) The endophytic fungi infection rate was significantly or extremely significantly positively correlated with N, P, K, Ca and Fe content, but had an extremely negative correlation with Zn content (r=-0.944**). Conclusion: The endophytic fungi can significantly promote the mineral nutrient accumulation of V. uliginosum, suggesting that the endophytic fungi colonization is an important factor affecting the mineral nutrient status of V. uliginosum, and the environmental conditions was important factor influencing the diversity and abundance of endophytic fungi in V. uliginosum roots. © 2017, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

16062,Insight into the composition and differentiation of endophytic microbial communities in kernels via 368 maize transcriptomes,"Introduction: Kernels are important reproductive organs in maize, yet there is a lack of systematic investigation on the differences in the composition of endophytic microorganisms in plants from a population perspective. Objectives: We aimed to elucidate the composition of endophytic microorganisms in developing maize kernels, emphasizing differences among various inbred lines. Methods: The transcriptomic data of 368 maize inbred lines were used to explore the composition and diversity of endophytic microorganisms. Results: The findings revealed a higher abundance of fungi than bacteria in developing maize kernels, followed by protozoa, while viruses were less abundant. There were significant differences in the composition and relative abundance of endophytic microorganisms among different maize lines. Diversity analysis revealed overall similarity in the community composition structure between tropical/subtropical (TST) and temperate (NSS) maize germplasm with apparent variations in community richness and abundance. The endophytic microorganisms network in the kernels from TST genotypes exhibited higher connectivity and stability compared to NSS kernels. Bacteria dominated the highly connected species in the networks, and different core species showed microbial phylum specificity. Some low-abundance species acted as core species, contributing to network stability. Beneficial bacteria were predominant in the core species of networks in TST kernels, while pathogenic bacteria were more abundant in the core species of networks in NSS kernels. Conclusion: Tropical maize germplasm may have advantages in resisting the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms, providing excellent genetic resources for disease-resistant breeding. © 2024",Tao F.; Chen F.; Liu H.; Chen C.; Cheng B.; Han G.,Journal of Advanced Research,2025,10.1016/j.jare.2024.05.018,0.947089637798328,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.721336110685283,0.278663889314717,0.999956619406599,4.33805934014764e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
