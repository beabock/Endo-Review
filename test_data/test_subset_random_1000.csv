6681,Production of hydrocarbon compounds by endophytic fungi Gliocladium species grown on cellulose,"Endophytic fungi belonging to the genus Gliocladium are able to degrade plant cellulose and synthesize complex hydrocarbons under microaerophilic conditions. These fungi could thus be used to produce biofuels from cellulosics without the need for hydrolytic pretreatments. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase micro-extraction (GC-MS-SPME) of head space gases from Gliocladium cultures demonstrated the production of C(6)-C(19) hydrocarbons including hexane, benzene, heptane, 3,4-dimethyl hexane, 1-octene, m-xylene, 3-methyl nonane, dodecane, tridecane, hexadecane and nonadecane directly from the cellulosic biomass. Hydrocarbon production was 100-fold higher in co-cultures of Gliocladium and Escherichia coli than in pure Gliocladium cultures. The dry mycelia weight is stable at stationary period in co-culture condition which may lead to synthesize more hydrocarbons. These fungi could potentially be developed into cost-effective biocatalysts for production of biofuels. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

6399,Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and chemical profiling ofCurvularia tsudaeendophytic inCynodon dactylon(L.) Pers,"There is a growing body of evidence that endophytic fungal metabolites possess important biological activities.Cynodon dactylon(L.) Pers., a well-known grass species with potential medicinal properties, is under-explored for the diversity of endophytic fungal species and their metabolites. We report here the diversity of endophytic fungi in the culm, leaf and inflorescence ofCynodon dactylonwhen cultured on moist blotter (MB), potato dextrose agar (PDA) and malt extract agar (MEA). Species richness, Shannon and Simpson diversity and evenness indices showed that PDA followed by MEA supported the growth of the largest number of fungal species. Amongst four fungal species tested,Curvularia tsudaewas selected for further studies on antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. The mycelial mat (MM) and culture filtrate (CF) of PD broth grownCurvularia tsudaeextracted with ethyl acetate and methanol, respectively, were subjected to antimicrobial assay against five bacterial and four fungal test isolates. Results indicated that the ethyl acetate extract of CF had moderate activity againstEnterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescenceandStaphylococcus aureuswhereas the methanolic MM extract showed high to moderate activity toAspergillus flavus, A. nigerandFusarium oxysporum. Cyclic voltammetric analysis of ethyl acetate extract showed very good antioxidant activity and the extract contained coumarins when determined by HPLC. High-resolution orbitrap LC-MS of ethyl acetate extract revealed the presence of metabolites with antimicrobial and antioxidant and other biological activities. Finding of the present study suggested thatCurvularia tsudaecould be exploited for pharmaceutical applications.","Nischitha, R; Vasanthkumari, MM; Kumaraswamy, BE; Shivanna, MB",3 BIOTECH,2020,10.1007/s13205-020-02250-0,0.966163429744796,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993439667881899,0.00656033211810121,0.999999523572694,4.76427306161931e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6217,Endophytic Fungi Produce Gibberellins and Indoleacetic Acid and Promotes Host-Plant Growth during Stress,"We isolated and examined two endophytic fungi for their potential to secrete phytohormones viz. gibberellins (GAs) and indoleacetic acid (IAA) and mitigate abiotic stresses like salinity and drought. The endophytic fungi Phoma glomerata LWL2 and Penicillium sp. LWL3 significantly promoted the shoot and allied growth attributes of GAs-deficient dwarf mutant Waito-C and Dongjin-beyo rice. Analysis of the pure cultures of these endophytic fungi showed biologically active GAs (GA(1), GA(3), GA(4) and GA(7)) in various quantities. The cultures of P. glomerata and Penicillium sp. also contained IAA. The culture application and endophytic-association with host-cucumber plants significantly increased the plant biomass and related growth parameters under sodium chloride and polyethylene glycol induced salinity and drought stress as compared to control plants. The endophytic symbiosis resulted in significantly higher assimilation of essential nutrients like potassium, calcium and magnesium as compared to control plants during salinity stress. Endophytic-association reduced the sodium toxicity and promoted the host-benefit ratio in cucumber plants as compared to non-inoculated control plants. The symbiotic-association mitigated stress by compromising the activities of reduced glutathione, catalase, peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase. Under stress conditions, the endophyte-infection significantly modulated stress through down-regulated abscisic acid, altered jasmonic acid, and elevated salicylic acid contents as compared to control. In conclusion, the two endophytes significantly reprogrammed the growth of host plants during stress conditions.","Waqas, M; Khan, AL; Kamran, M; Hamayun, M; Kang, SM; Kim, YH; Lee, IJ",MOLECULES,2012,10.3390/molecules170910754,0.902765017451023,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999838088936141,1.6191106385861e-4,0.99999999970948,2.90519719392535e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3820,Soil-plant compartments affect fungal microbiome diversity and composition in grapevine,"Plant compartments provide unique niches that lead to specific microbial associations. The microbiota colonizing the endophytic compartment (endorhizosphere) and the rhizosphere contribute to productivity, plant growth, phytoremediation and carbon sequestration. The main objective of this study was to investigate how fungal communities are enriched in different habitats outside and inside of grapevine roots. For this purpose, the spatial dynamics of the fungal communities associated with three soil-plant compartments (bulk soil, rhizosphere and endorhizosphere) were characterized by ITS high-throughput amplicon sequencing (HTAS). Fungal communities were largely affected in their diversity and composition by soil-plant compartments, whereas the spatial variation (i.e. across five vineyards) was low. The endorhizosphere compartment differed most from the other two, suggesting that the root tissues entail a barrier for fungal colonization. The results of functional prediction via FUNGuild suggested an increase in the relative abundances of potential plant pathogens, endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhiza, and a decrease in wood, dung and undefined saprotrophs from bulk soil towards the endorhizosphere. Roots of asymptomatic vines were a microbial niche that is inhabited by soilborne fungi associated with grapevine trunk diseases, which opens up new perspectives in the study of the endophytic role of these pathogens on grapevines. Results obtained in this study provide helpful information to better know how the host shapes its microbiome and the implications for vineyard productivity and management.

20810,Anthracnose of cereals and grasses,"Anthracnose impacts on the health of cereals and grasses worldwide and is caused by a monophyletic group of taxa in the genus Colletotrichum. During the past decade there have been important changes in our knowledge of how the grass-associated Colletotrichum have evolved, and an increased understanding of the mechanisms by which these fungi engage in hemibiotrophic interactions with their host plants. Several new species of graminicolous Colletotrichum have been described from both cool- and warm-season grasses, revealing a pattern of distinctly specialized relationships between these fungi and their hosts. In this review, an overview of the Colletotrichum species that cause anthracnose disease in cereals and grasses is provided. The current knowledge of how these organisms interact with and impact their hosts, their evolutionary histories, population processes, and how these factors come together to influence the diversity and ecology of the graminicolous Colletotrichum group are highlighed. © 2009 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

13339,Genetic diversity of Lophodermium piceae in South Finland,"Lophodermium piceae, the dominant needle endophyte of Norway spruce (Picea abies), is known to be extremely diverse. This work aimed to test the possible occurrence of cryptic species within the morphological species L. piceae. Genetic variation in 36 South Finnish L. piceae isolates originating from six localities was investigated by comparing DNA sequences of three genetic markers. One of the markers was the internal transcribed sequence (ITS) of the ribosomal DNA and the other two (LP1 and LP2) were based on sequence characterized amplified regions designed for L. piceae. The LP2 marker could be detected only from isolates of L. piceae but not from 20 other ascomycete species tested. This sequence, therefore, is considered as a species-specific marker for L. piceae. For comparison, ITS sequences of isolates representing two other Lophodermium species, L. pinastri and L. seditiosum, were also investigated. In a neighbor-joining analysis of ITS sequences all L. piceae isolates fell into one cluster, which was clearly separate from those of L. pinastri and L. seditiosum. Dendrograms of the three markers were incongruent indicating that the L. piceae population examined consisted of a single phylogenetic species. No geographical differentiation was observed. Our results confirm that L. piceae is a genetically highly diverse endophytic species. © 2007 The Authors.",Müller M.M.; Valjakka R.; Hantula J.,Forest Pathology,2007,10.1111/j.1439-0329.2007.00504.x,0.96526218464637,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.697671008795175,0.302328991204825,0.999995553366105,4.44663389453925e-6,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
2577,Trichoderma asperellum empowers tomato plants and suppresses Fusarium oxysporum through priming responses,"Plant-associated microbes play crucial roles in plant health and promote growth under stress. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is one of the strategic crops grown throughout Egypt and is a widely grown vegetable worldwide. However, plant disease severely affects tomato production. The post-harvest disease (Fusarium wilt disease) affects food security globally, especially in the tomato fields. Thus, an alternative effective and economical biological treatment to the disease was recently established using Trichoderma asperellum. However, the role of rhizosphere microbiota in the resistance of tomato plants against soil-borne Fusarium wilt disease (FWD) remains unclear. In the current study, a dual culture assay of T. asperellum against various phytopathogens (e.g., Fusarium oxysporum, F. solani, Alternaria alternata, Rhizoctonia solani, and F. graminerarum) was performed in vitro. Interestingly, T. asperellum exhibited the highest mycelial inhibition rate (53.24%) against F. oxysporum. In addition, 30% free cell filtrate of T. asperellum inhibited F. oxysporum by 59.39%. Various underlying mechanisms were studied to explore the antifungal activity against F. oxysporum, such as chitinase activity, analysis of bioactive compounds by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and assessment of fungal secondary metabolites against F. oxysporum mycotoxins in tomato fruits. Additionally, the plant growth-promoting traits of T. asperellum were studied (e.g., IAA production, Phosphate solubilization), and the impact on tomato seeds germination. Scanning electron microscopy, plant root sections, and confocal microscopy were used to show the mobility of the fungal endophyte activity to promote tomato root growth compared with untreated tomato root. T. asperellum enhanced the growth of tomato seeds and controlled the wilt disease caused by the phytopathogen F. oxysporum by enhancing the number of leaves as well as shoot and root length (cm) and fresh and dry weights (g). Furthermore, Trichoderma extract protects tomato fruits from post-harvest infection by F. oxysporum. Taking together, T. asperellum represents a safe and effective controlling agent against Fusarium infection of tomato plants.","Sehim, AE; Hewedy, OA; Altammar, KA; Alhumaidi, MS; Abd Elghaffar, RY",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2023,10.3389/fmicb.2023.1140378,0.991664087211351,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999978702599237,2.1297400762659e-5,0.999999999995086,4.9140691515958695e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

3939,Beneficial Soil Microbes Negatively Affect Spider Mites and Aphids in Pepper,"Beneficial soil microbes have long been recognized for their ability to improve plant growth, to antagonize pathogens and to prime plants against biotic stressors. Nevertheless, their ability to enhance plant resistance against arthropod pests remains largely unexplored, especially in crop plants such as pepper. Herein, we assessed the effects of several fungal and bacterial species/strains applied in the soil on the performance of key pests of pepper plants. Specifically, we recorded the impact of pepper inoculation with commercial strains of beneficial bacteria (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Pseudomonas spp.) as well as fungi (Trichoderma spp. and Cordyceps fumosorosea) on the population growth of the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, and the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae. Furthermore, we recorded the effects of microbial inoculation on plant growth parameters, such as stem and root weight. We found that both pests can be negatively affected by microbial inoculation: spider mites laid up to 40% fewer eggs, and the number of aphids were up to 50% less on pepper-inoculated plants, depending on the microbe. We also recorded a variation among the tested microbes in their impact on herbivore performance, but no significant effects were found on plant biomass. Our results add to the growing literature that beneficial soil microbes may be capable of exerting biocontrol capabilities against aboveground herbivorous pests possibly, among other means, via the elicitation of plant defense responses.","Pappas, ML; Samaras, K; Koufakis, I; Broufas, GD",AGRONOMY-BASEL,2021,10.3390/agronomy11091831,0.904065554195557,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.973389139328731,0.0266108606712687,0.999985866988246,1.41330117536809e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18763,The impact of Bisphenol A on the endophytic bacterial community and transcriptome of soybean seedlings.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is widely acknowledged as an endocrine disruptor, and its toxicological effects have garnered considerable research interest. In this investigation, a soil pot experiment was conducted to examine the consequences of sustained BPA exposure on the growth of soybean seedlings, the transcriptome, and the endophytic bacterial community. We observed a substantial inhibition in soybean seedling growth. Transcriptome analysis showed that growth-related genes in both leaves and roots were markedly downregulated following BPA treatment. Intriguingly, BPA considerably increased the abundance and diversity of endophytic bacteria in leaves while suppressing beta diversity in roots. A significant association was identified between amplicon sequence variants and differentially expressed genes under BPA treatment in the leaves and roots.

8520,Effect of Nano Fe-oxide and Endophytic Fungus (P. indica) on Petroleum Hydrocarbons Degradation in an Arsenic Contaminated Soil under Barley Cultivation,"BackgroundHeavy metals and petroleum hydrocarbon pollution are important environmental problems. This research was conducted to evaluate the effect of nano Fe-oxide and endophytic fungus (P. indica) on petroleum hydrocarbons degradation in an arsenic and petroleum hydrocarbons contaminated soil using barley plant.MethodsTreatments consisted of the presence (E+) and the absence (E-) of P.indica fungi, soil contaminated with As in the rates of 0 (AS(0)), 12 (AS(12)) and 24 (As-24) mg As /kg of soil, and application of 0 (Fe-0) and 1% (Fe-1) (W/W) nano Fe-oxide. The plant used in this study was the barley plant. After 7 weeks, the root and shoot As concentration was measured using atomic absorption spectroscopy. The concentration of total soil petroleum hydrocarbon (TPHS) was measured using GC-mass.ResultsApplication of nano Fe-oxide in soil treated with 12 and 24 mg As/kg soil decreased root As concentration by 30 and 20.6%, respectively. The presence of P.indica caused a significant reduction in the shoot As concentration. With increasing shoot Fe concentration the shoot As concentration was decreased. The highest TPHS degradation was observed in non As-polluted soil that containing 1% (W/W) nano Fe-oxide in the presence of P.indica, while the lowest that was in As polluted soil (24 mg As/kg soil) without applying nano Fe-oxide and in the absence of P.indica.ConclusionIncreasing soil sorption properties due to nano Fe-oxide application had significant effect on TPHS degradation in the presence of P.indica. However the role of soil condition on the amount of TPHS degradation cannot be ignored.","Baghaie, AH; Jabari, AG",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING,2019,10.1007/s40201-019-00402-w,0.858397422203942,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994650851099431,0.00534914890056855,0.999999876005281,1.23994718936871e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10126,Deletion of the Fungal Gene soft Disrupts Mutualistic Symbiosis between the Grass Endophyte Epichloe festucae and the Host Plant,"Hyphal anastomosis, or vegetative hyphal fusion, establishes the interconnection of individual hyphal strands into an integrated network of a fungal mycelium. In contrast to recent advances in the understanding of the molecular basis for hyphal anastomosis, knowledge of the physiological role of hyphal anastomosis in the natural habitats of filamentous fungi is still very limited. To investigate the role of hyphal anastomosis in fungal endophyte-plant interactions, we generated mutant strains lacking the Epichloe festucae soft (so) gene, an ortholog of the hyphal anastomosis gene so in the endophytic fungus E. festucae. The E. festucae Delta so mutant strains grew similarly to the wild-type strain in culture but with reduced aerial hyphae and completely lacked hyphal anastomosis. The most striking phenotype of the E. festucae Delta so mutant strain was that it failed to establish a mutualistic symbiosis with the tall fescue plant host (Lolium arundinaceum); instead, it killed the host plant within 2 months after the initial infection. Microscopic examination revealed that the death of the tall fescue plant host was associated with the distortion and disorganization of plant cells. This study suggests that hyphal anastomosis may have an important role in the establishment/maintenance of fungal endophyte-host plant mutualistic symbiosis.","Charlton, ND; Shoji, JY; Ghimire, SR; Nakashima, J; Craven, KD",EUKARYOTIC CELL,2012,10.1128/EC.00191-12,0.947741102936622,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999040695564853,9.5930443514696e-4,0.999999999643739,3.56261464773411e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

7519,Ribosomal ITS sequence-directed selection for endophytic Myrothecium strains antagonistic to Ralstonia solanacearum to control patchouli bacterial wilt,"Ralstonia solanacearum (RS) wilt is a soil-borne devastating disease that causes enormous loss to patchouli in tropical and subtropical areas of Asia. The aim of this study was to develop a feasible method to isolate antagonistic fungal endophytes against RS from patchouli and to investigate their effects on biocontrol of patchouli RS wilt. Diversity of endophytic fungi in roots, stems and leaves of healthy patchouli was estimated with Illumina-based sequencing strategies. The number of fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at 97% similarity level was 465, 542 and 298 in roots, stems and leaves, respectively. The most detected genus in patchouli stems and leaves was Aspergillus, while the most dominant genera in roots were Athelia (11.1%) and Myrothecium (10.1%). Due to wide applications of Myrothecium species for biocontrol, 40 isolates of Myrothecium were isolated from patchouli roots using the selection medium for Myrothecium. At the species level, the strain (SWG1) with the most potent activity against RS in vitro was further identified and used to control patchouli RS wilt in vivo. The results of pot experiments showed that fresh weight, dry weight and height of patchouli seedlings inoculated with SWG1 increased by 58.2%, 65.5% and 11.9%, respectively, compared to seedlings without inoculation. The inoculation of SWG1 reduced the disease incidence and disease index of patchouli RS wilt by 66.7% and 71.0%, respectively. The results indicated the directed isolation of antagonistic endophytic fungi based on Illumina sequencing analysis of the ribosomal fungal ITS should be valuable to screen biological agents to control plant diseases.","Shi, WG; Li, JQ; Yao, HX; Li, JB; Chen, MQ; Chen, DT; Fu, YH; Xie, HR; Deng, ZJ",BIOCONTROL,2022,10.1007/s10526-021-10125-3,0.820041048175033,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.877632749421214,0.122367250578786,0.999965144566647,3.48554333533535e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
15016,Aloe Vera Extract Gel-Biosynthesized Selenium Nanoparticles Enhance Disease Resistance in Lettuce by Modulating the Metabolite Profile and Bacterial Endophytes Composition,"The use of nanotechnology to suppress crop diseases has attracted significant attention in agriculture. The present study investigated the antifungal mechanism by which aloe vera extract gel-biosynthesized (AVGE) selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) suppressed Fusarium-induced wilt disease in lettuce (Lactuca sativa). AVGE Se NPs were synthesized by utilizing sodium selenite as a Se source and AVGE as a biocompatible capping and reducing agent. Over 21 d, 2.75% of total AVGE Se NPs was dissolved into Se ions, which was more than 8-fold greater than that of bare Se NPs (0.34%). Upon exposure to soil applied AVGE Se NPs at 50 mg/kg, fresh shoot biomass was significantly increased by 61.6 and 27.8% over the infected control and bare Se NPs, respectively. As compared to the infected control, the shoot levels of citrate, isocitrate, succinate, malate, and 2-oxo-glutarate were significantly upregulated by 0.5-3-fold as affected by both Se NPs. In addition, AVGE Se NPs significantly increased the shoot level of khelmarin D, a type of coumarin, by 4.40- and 0.71-fold over infected controls and bare Se NPs, respectively. Additionally, AVGE Se NPs showed greater upregulation of jasmonic acid and downregulation of abscisic acid content relative to bare Se NPs in diseased shoots. Moreover, the diversity of bacterial endophytes was significantly increased by AVGE Se NPs, with the values of Shannon index 40.2 and 9.16% greater over the infected control and bare Se NPs. Collectively, these findings highlight the significant potential of AVGE Se NPs as an effective and biocompatible strategy for nanoenabled sustainable crop protection. © 2023 American Chemical Society.",Shang H.; Ma C.; Li C.; Cai Z.; Shen Y.; Han L.; Wang C.; Tran J.; Elmer W.H.; White J.C.; Xing B.,ACS Nano,2023,10.1021/acsnano.3c02790,0.964494362982433,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.789659054324981,0.210340945675019,0.999999706578611,2.93421388630755e-7,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
12779,Fungal endophyte Phomopsis liquidambari B3 enriches the diversity of nodular culturable endophytic bacteria associated with continuous cropping of peanut,"Previously, the application of the fungal endophyte Phomopsis liquidambari B3 exhibited notable effect in alleviating soil obstacles caused by continuous cropping of peanut. It was supposed that P. liquidambari B3 could enhance the efficiency of nodulation and nitrogen fixation by enriching the diversity of nodular endophytic bacteria under continous monocropping system. To verify this hypothesis, a pot experiment was conducted under natural conditions. Four treatments were set as follow: discontinuous cropping soil (NS), continuous cropping soil (CK), continuous cropping soil inoculate with actived P. liquidambari B3 (CSB3), and continuous cropping soil inoculate with sterilized P. liquidambari B3 (CSIB3). As a result, a total of 120 isolates were obtained. Our study clearly declared that the addition of fungal endophyte effectively enriched the genetic diversity and the community composition in CSB3.

18769,"Antimicrobial, Quorum Sensing Inhibition, and Anti-Cancer Activities of Silver Nanoparticles Synthesized from Kenyan Bacterial Endophytes of Teclea nobilis.","Untapped bioactive compounds from microbial endophytes offer a promising solution to counter antimicrobial and chemotherapeutic drug resistance when complexed as silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). AgNPs were biosynthesized using cell-free supernatants from endophytic Streptomyces sp. KE4D and Bacillus safensis KE4K isolated from the Kenyan medicinal plant Teclea nobilis, following fermentation in three different media. Bacterial extracts were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. AgNPs were characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Antimicrobial activity was assessed using agar well diffusion assays, and quorum sensing inhibition (QSI) was investigated using Chromobacterium violaceum. Anti-cancer potential was evaluated against breast (MCF-7) and prostate cancer (DU-145) cell lines using MTT assays. AgNPs were 5-55 nm in size, with KE4D AgNPs being spherical and KE4K AgNPs exhibiting various shapes. Cyclopropane acetic acids and fatty acids were identified as possible capping agents. Medium-dependent antimicrobial activity was observed, with medium Mannitol and medium 5294 AgNPs displaying stronger activity, particularly against Gram-negative indicators. KE4D medium 5294 AgNPs demonstrated 85.12% violacein inhibition at 140 µg/mL and better QSI activity, whilst KE4K AgNPs were better antimicrobials. The AgNPs IC50 values were <3.5 µg/mL for MCF-7 and <2.5 µg/mL for DU-145 cells. The bioactivity of biosynthesized AgNPs is influenced by the bacterial isolate and fermentation medium, suggesting that AgNP synthesis can be tailored for specific bioactivity.",Mohamed F; Chenia HY,International journal of molecular sciences,2025,10.3390/ijms26073306,0.891563295640944,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991432141031929,0.00856785896807111,0.999999910950742,8.90492577454438e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12701,Fungal endophytes from salt- adapted plants confer salt tolerance and promote growth in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) at early seedling stage,"With increasing human global population, increased yield under saline conditions is a desirable trait for major food crops. Use of endophytes, isolated from halophytic hosts, seems to be an exciting approach for conferring salt tolerance to a salt -sensitive crop. Therefore, in the current study, fungal endophytes were isolated from halophytic plants' roots and their ability to withstand in vitro salt stress was evaluated. The fungal endophytes could withstand up to 1M NaCl concentrations and this tolerance was independent of their host or tissue source. When inoculated on salt-sensitive wheat seeds/seedlings, several of the endophytes showed a positive impact on germination and biomass-related parameters upon salt stress, both in vitro and under glasshouse conditions. One of the isolates from dicot plants (identified as Microsphaeropsis arundinis) could successfully colonize wheat and promote its growth under salt and no -salt conditions. Amongst the fungal isolates that are known to be natural endophytes of wheat, Chaetomium globosum was the best performing isolate and has previously been reported to be an effective biocontrol agent. Based on the results of our preliminary study, we suggest that these fungal endophytes could prove beneficial for enhancing the salt stress tolerance of wheat crop.","Manjunatha, N; Manjunatha, N; Li, H; Sivasithamparam, K; Jones, MGK; Edwards, I; Wylie, SJ; Agarrwal, R",MICROBIOLOGY-SGM,2022,10.1099/mic.0.001225,0.994999514461072,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.809807531683771,0.190192468316229,0.999457140960883,5.4285903911699e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
18201,Bacterial microbiome of root-associated endophytes of Salicornia europaea in correspondence to different levels of salinity.,"The halophytes have evolved several strategies to survive in saline environments; however, an additional support from their associated microbiota helps combat adverse conditions. Hence, our driving interests to investigate the endophytic bacterial community richness, diversity, and composition associated to roots of Salicornia europaea from two test sites with different origins of soil salinity. We assumed that salinity will have a negative effect on the diversity of endophytes but simultaneously will permit the high occurrence of halophylic bacteria. Further, to establish the role of the host and its external environment in determining the endophytic diversity, we analyzed the physico-chemical parameters of root zone soil and the concentration of salt ions in the plant roots. The results based on the Miseq Illumina sequencing approach revealed a higher number of endophytic bacterial OTUs at naturally saline test site with a higher level of soil salinity. Proteobacteria and Bacteriodetes were the dominant endophytic phyla at both analyzed sites; additionally, the high occurrence of Planctomycetes and Acidobacteria at more saline site and the occurrence of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi at less saline site were recorded. The salinity in the root zone soil was crucial in structuring the endophytic community of S. europaea, and the significant prevalence of representatives from the phyla Deltaproteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Caldithrix, Fibrobacteres, and Verrucomicrobia at the more saline test site suggest domination of halophylic bacteria with potential role in mitigation of salt stress of halophytes.",Szymańska S; Borruso L; Brusetti L; Hulisz P; Furtado B; Hrynkiewicz K,Environmental science and pollution research international,2018,10.1007/s11356-018-2530-0,0.941140021701695,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.976579170887752,0.0234208291122479,0.999997698518823,2.30148117708051e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
21068,Fungal endophytes associated with some thermo-tolerant plants in salt-stress ecosystems,"The ecological fitness of plants growing in harsh ecosystem possibly could be affected by the presence of endophytes. During June 2016, the 35 asymptomatic plants were collected from extremely hot deserts and dry saltmarshes around Abadan, southwestern Iran and surveyed for the endophytic fungi. A total of 59 fungal isolates were recovered and subjected to morphological and DNA analysis. The mycelial biomass was produced and freeze-dried for DNA extraction. The regions of internal transcribed spacer 1 and 2 and intervening 5.8S nrDNA (ITS), partial translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1α) and partial RNA polymerase II (rpb2) were amplified and sequenced. On the basis of their morphological characters, in combination with DNA analysis and multi-locus phylogeny, the isolates were identified as Alternaria sene-cionicola, A. alternata, Exserohilum gedarefense and Cladosporium sp. The topology of a phylogenetic tree constructed based on combined sequences of ITS, tef1á and rpb2 regions showed that the isolates of A. alternata generated a distinct and well-supported clade, while the isolates of A. senecionicola clustered with three other species, including A. geophila, A. cerealis and A arborescens. The low diversity of endophytic fungi detected in this study support the hypothesis that harsh ecosystems limit the species richness of fungal endophytes.

10141,Fungal endophyte protects Atractylodes lancea from root rot caused by Fusarium oxysporum,"Endophytic fungi, which stimulate a variety of defence reactions in host plants without causing visible disease symptoms, have been isolated from almost every plant. However, beneficial interactions between fungal endophytes and pathogens from the same habitat remain largely unknown. An inoculation of Atractylodes lancea plantlets with Gilmaniella sp. AL12 (AL12) prior to infection with Fusarium oxysporum prevented the necrotization of root tissues and plant growth retardation commonly associated with fusarium root rot. Quantification of F. oxysporum infections using real-time PCR revealed a correlation between root rot symptoms and the relative amount of fungal DNA. Pretreatment with AL12 reduced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species stimulated by F. oxysporum. An in vitro analysis of their interactions under axenic culture conditions showed AL12 could inhibit F. oxysporum growth. Additionally, F. oxysporum infections were shown to decrease salicylic acid (SA) production compared with control plantlets. SA biosynthesis inhibitors, 2-aminoindan-2-phosphonic acid and paclobutrazol, abolished the inhibition of F. oxysporum growth in A. lancea even after inoculation with AL12. The results indicated that the fungal endophyte protected A. lancea not only by direct antibiosis, but also by reversing the F. oxysporum-mediated suppression of SA production.","Ren, CG; Chen, F; Dai, CC",PLANT PATHOLOGY,2017,10.1111/ppa.12567,0.980722816714,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995667815183492,0.00433218481650767,0.999442077490929,5.5792250907083e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The entophytic bacterial community structure and diversity were investigated by PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). The results showed that the diversity and community structure of endophytic bacteria in T. matsutake varied significantly, while those from the environments alike had high similarity. In addition, each T. matsutake sample contained more than 15 species of endophytes, with that from Yanyuan having the highest endophytes diversity index and abundance, while those from Xiaojin were the lowest.

20525,Fungi pathogenic on wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum L.) in northern Tunisia as potential biocontrol agents,"The distribution and life cycle of wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum L.) and a survey of the pathogens of this plant are reported for the northern regions of Tunisia. Wild radish is a common weed of cereal crops and legumes. It germinates in early autumn (October), develops a rosette stage in November to December after which stem growth, flowering and pod production occur through to May, with pod maturity completed in June. Fungus isolation from the foliar tissues exhibiting disease symptoms showed that wild radish was infected with the fungi Albugo candida, Alternaria spp. including A. brassicicola, and A. raphani, Erysiphe cruciferarum, Stemphylium herbarum, Peronospora parasitica and Phoma lingam. Ascochyta spp., Cercospora armoraciae, Cladosporium cladosporioides and Colletotrichum higginsianum are here reported from wild radish for the first time. Inoculation tests of pathogens on wild radish plants showed that the most injurious fungi were Alternaria raphani and Phoma lingam. The remaining pathogens were weakly to moderately aggressive on this weed. To access the pathogenic effect of fungi spontaneously infecting natural populations of wild radish, the weed was grown in a field experiment with and without the broad-spectrum systemic fungicide Carbendazim. Results showed a statistically significant two-fold decrease in the number and weight of seed pods in the non-treated plants, indicating that the reproductive potential of wild radish was naturally reduced by fungal infection. Foliar pathogenic fungi have a potential in the integrated weed management of wild radish, this role merits further investigations.","Djébali, N; Scott, JK; Jourdan, M; Souissi, T",PHYTOPATHOLOGIA MEDITERRANEA,2009,NA,0.866053612767111,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.738966367946751,0.261033632053249,0.995587567782659,0.00441243221734111,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
7612,Effects of a Dark Septate Fungal Endophyte on the Growth and Physiological Response of Seedlings to Drought in an Epiphytic Orchid,"Dark septate endophytes (DSE) are a group of facultative biotrophic root-colonizing fungi that live within a plant for a part of their life cycle without causing any apparent, overt negative effects. These fungi have been found in >600 different plant species, including orchids. Although the precise ecological functions of dark septate fungal endophytes are not yet well understood, there is increasing evidence that they enhance host growth and nutrient acquisition, and improve the plant's ability to tolerate biotic and abiotic stresses. In this research, we tested the effects of a DSE isolated from the roots of the epiphytic orchid Coelogyne viscosa on the growth and drought tolerance of orchid seedlings. Our results showed that addition of DSE inoculum significantly enhanced biomass of seedlings and increased the activities of drought resistance related enzymes and the accumulation of osmoregulatory substances. These results suggest that DSE can fulfill important ecological functions in stressful environments and potentially play an important role in the life cycle of epiphytic orchids.","Liu, N; Jacquemyn, H; Liu, Q; Shao, SC; Ding, G; Xing, XK",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2022,10.3389/fmicb.2022.961172,0.907899487944436,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994777922957786,0.00522207704221412,0.999999999969134,3.0865532352208896e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15549,Microbe-dependent heterosis in maize,"Hybrids account for nearly all commercially planted varieties of maize and many other crop plants because crosses between inbred lines of these species produce first-generation [F1] offspring that greatly outperform their parents. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, called heterosis or hybrid vigor, are not well understood despite over a century of intensive research. The leading hypotheses—which focus on quantitative genetic mechanisms (dominance, overdominance, and epistasis) and molecular mechanisms (gene dosage and transcriptional regulation)—have been able to explain some but not all of the observed patterns of heterosis. Abiotic stressors are known to impact the expression of heterosis; however, the potential role of microbes in heterosis has largely been ignored. Here, we show that heterosis of root biomass and other traits in maize is strongly dependent on the belowground microbial environment. We found that, in some cases, inbred lines perform as well by these criteria as their F1 offspring under sterile conditions but that heterosis can be restored by inoculation with a simple community of seven bacterial strains. We observed the same pattern for seedlings inoculated with autoclaved versus live soil slurries in a growth chamber and for plants grown in steamed or fumigated versus untreated soil in the field. In a different field site, however, soil steaming increased rather than decreased heterosis, indicating that the direction of the effect depends on community composition, environment, or both. Together, our results demonstrate an ecological phenomenon whereby soil microbes differentially impact the early growth of inbred and hybrid maize. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

2088,Alkaloid Variation Among Epichloid Endophytes of Sleepygrass (Achnatherum robustum) and Consequences for Resistance to Insect Herbivores,"Epichloid endophytes are well known symbionts of many cool-season grasses that may alleviate environmental stresses for their hosts. For example, endophytes produce alkaloid compounds that may be toxic to invertebrate or vertebrate herbivores. Achnatherum robustum, commonly called sleepygrass, was aptly named due to the presence of an endophyte that causes toxic effects to livestock and wildlife. Variation in alkaloid production observed in two A. robustum populations located near Weed and Cloudcroft in the Lincoln National Forest, New Mexico, suggests two different endophyte species are present in these populations. Genetic analyses of endophyte-infected samples revealed major differences in the endophyte alkaloid genetic profiles from the two populations, which were supported with chemical analyses. The endophyte present in the Weed population was shown to produce chanoclavine I, paspaline, and terpendoles, so thus resembles the previously described EpichloA << funkii. The endophyte present in the Cloudcroft population produces chanoclavineI, ergonovine, lysergic acid amide, and paspaline, and is an undescribed endophyte species. We observed very low survival rates for aphids feeding on plants infected with the Cloudcroft endophyte, while aphid survival was better on endophyte infected plants in the Weed population. This observation led to the hypothesis that the alkaloid ergonovine is responsible for aphid mortality. Direct testing of aphid survival on oat leaves supplemented with ergonovine provided supporting evidence for this hypothesis. The results of this study suggest that alkaloids produced by the Cloudcroft endophyte, specifically ergonovine, have insecticidal properties.","Shymanovich, T; Saari, S; Lovin, ME; Jarmusch, AK; Jarmusch, SA; Musso, AM; Charlton, ND; Young, CA; Cech, NB; Faeth, SH",JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY,2015,10.1007/s10886-014-0534-x,0.979478424477108,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999717173700586,2.8282629941366e-4,0.999999275953401,7.24046598676864e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

In the current study, three experiments assessed the activity of secondary metabolites of three strains of endophytic Fusarium oxysporum (Emb2.4o, Eny1.31i and V5w2) against the banana (Musa spp.) root-parasitic nematodes Radopholus similis, Pratylenchus goodeyi and Helicotylenchus multicinctus under different laboratory procedures. All experiments showed higher nematode mortality after 24 h exposure for each endophyte culture filtrate compared to control treatments after 24 h exposure. Helicotylenchus multicinctus was less sensitive to endophytic treatments than R. similis and P. goodeyi; and R. similis was more sensitive than P. goodeyi to strain V5w2 even at lower filtrate concentrations. Based on motility of R. similis and P. goodeyi, light (14 L: 10 D h) had no significant effect on endophyte culture filtrates (Emb2.4o and V5w2).

14984,Lipidome of the Brown Macroalga Undaria pinnatifida: Influence of Season and Endophytic Infection,"An analysis of the lipidome of the brown alga Undaria pinnatifida (Laminariales) was performed’ more than 900 molecular species were identified in 12 polar lipids and 1 neutral lipid using HPLC/MS-MS. The seasonal changes of U. pinnatifida lipidome were determined. It was shown that acclimatization to winter and spring was accompanied by an increase in the unsaturation of both polar and neutral lipids. In autumn and summer, on the contrary, the contents of more saturated molecular species of all lipid classes increased. Based on the data obtained, a scheme for the polar and neutral lipid synthesis in brown algae was proposed. In addition, the influence of infection with the brown filamentous endophyte Laminariocolax aecidioides (Ectocarpales) on U. pinnatifida lipidome was studied. It was found that infection has the most noticeable effect on the molecular species composition of triacylglycerides, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylhydroxyethylglycine of the host macrophyte. In infected samples of algae, changes in the composition of triacylglycerides were revealed both in areas with the presence of an endophyte and in adjacent intact tissues, which may indicate the occurrence of a secondary infection. © 2023 by the authors.",Chadova K.; Velansky P.,Marine Drugs,2023,10.3390/md21090466,0.878332197078438,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.731516017076453,0.268483982923547,0.999986689905225,1.33100947753428e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
18185,Bacterial Production of Indole Related Compounds Reveals Their Role in Association Between Duckweeds and Endophytes.,"Duckweed farming can be a sustainable practice for biofuel production, animal feed supplement, and wastewater treatment, although large scale production remains a challenge. Plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) have been shown to improve plant health by producing phytohormones such as auxin. While some of the mechanisms for plant growth promotion have been characterized in soil epiphytes, more work is necessary to understand how plants may select for bacterial endophytes that have the ability to provide an exogenous source of phytohormones such as auxin. We have isolated and characterized forty-seven potentially endophytic bacteria from surface-sterilized duckweed tissues and screened these bacterial strains for production of indole related compounds using the Salkowski colorimetric assay. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), and indole produced by various bacterial isolates were verified by mass spectrometry. Using the Salkowski reagent, we found that 79% of the isolated bacterial strains from our collection may be capable of producing indole related compounds to various extents during in vitro growth. Of these bacteria that are producing indole related compounds, 19% are additionally producing indole. There is an apparent correlation between the type of indole related compound produced by a particular bacteria and the duckweed genus from which the bacterial strain is derived. These results suggest the possible association between different duckweed genera and endophytes that are producing distinct types of secondary metabolites. Understanding the role of indole related compounds during interaction between endophytes and the plant host may be useful to help design synthetic bacterial communities that could target specific or multiple species of duckweed in the future to sustainably enhance plant growth.",Gilbert S; Xu J; Acosta K; Poulev A; Lebeis S; Lam E,Frontiers in chemistry,2018,10.3389/fchem.2018.00265,0.959067135779024,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.92883430549418,0.0711656945058198,0.999999527716799,4.72283201213841e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3300,Persistence of plant-mediated microbial soil legacy effects in soil and inside roots,"Plant-soil feedbacks are shaped by microbial legacies that plants leave in the soil. We tested the persistence of these legacies after subsequent colonization by the same or other plant species using 6 typical grassland plant species. Soil fungal legacies were detectable for months, but the current plant effect on fungi amplified in time. By contrast, in bacterial communities, legacies faded away rapidly and bacteria communities were influenced strongly by the current plant. However, both fungal and bacterial legacies were conserved inside the roots of the current plant species and their composition significantly correlated with plant growth. Hence, microbial soil legacies present at the time of plant establishment play a vital role in shaping plant growth even when these legacies have faded away in the soil due the growth of the current plant species. We conclude that soil microbiome legacies are reversible and versatile, but that they can create plant-soil feedbacks via altering the endophytic community acquired during early ontogeny. Legacies of past plant communities are likely to influence plant-soil interactions. Here, the authors report a reciprocal transplant experiment showing that soil microbial legacies shaped by previous plants persist for soil fungi and root endophytes but can be reversed by a next generation of plants for soil bacteria.","Hannula, SE; Heinen, R; Huberty, M; Steinauer, K; De Long, JR; Jongen, R; Bezemer, TM",NATURE COMMUNICATIONS,2021,10.1038/s41467-021-25971-z,0.89725730159303,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.876362953087392,0.123637046912608,0.99999933628766,6.6371234042073e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

18134,"Chryseobacterium phosphatilyticum sp. nov., a phosphate-solubilizing endophyte isolated from cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) root.","A bacterial strain, designated as ISE14T, with Gram-stain-negative and non-motile rod-shaped cells, was isolated from the root of a cucumber plant collected in a field in Iksan, Republic of Korea and was characterized using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain ISE14T represented a member of the genus Chryseobacterium and was closely related to Chryseobacterium viscerum 687B-08T (16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 98.50 %), Chryseobacterium lactis NCTC 11390T (98.49 %), Chryseobacterium ureilyticum F-Fue-04IIIaaaaT (98.49 %) and Chryseobacterium oncorhynchi 701B-08T (98.04 %). Average nucleotide identity values between genome sequences of strain ISE14T and the closely related species ranged from 81.44 to 83.15 %, which were lower than the threshold of 95 % (corresponding to a DNA-DNA hybridization value of 70 %). The DNA G+C content of strain ISE14T was 36.3 mol%. The dominant fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0, summed feature 9 (iso-C17 : 1ω9c and/or C16 : 0 10-methyl), summed feature 3 (iso-C15 : 0 2-OH and/or C16 : 1ω7c) and iso-C17 : 0 3-OH. The major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, three unidentified aminolipids and eight unidentified lipids; the predominant respiratory quinone was MK-6. On the basis of the evidence presented in this study, strain ISE14T can be distinguished from closely related species belonging to the genus Chryseobacterium. Thus, strain ISE14T is a novel species of the genus Chryseobacterium, for which the name Chryseobacteriumphosphatilyticum sp. nov. is proposed.

15252,Dereplication of Cytochalasans and Octaketides in Cytotoxic Extracts of Endophytic Fungi from Casearia arborea (Salicaceae),"Endophytes have been shown to be a source of novel drug prototypes. The Casearia genus is known for presenting cytotoxic clerodane diterpenes; however, there are few reports on secondary metabolites produced by its fungal microbiota. Thus, in the present study endophytic fungi obtained from the fresh leaves of C. arborea were grown in potato dextrose broth and rice to perform a secondary metabolite prospection study. The cytotoxic profile of the crude extracts at 10 µg/mL was determined by a colorimetric assay on tumor cell lines. The endophytes producing cytotoxic extracts were identified through phylogenetic analysis and belong to Diaporthe and Colletotrichum species. Metabolites present in these extracts were organized in molecular networking format based on HRMS-MS, and a dereplication process was performed to target compounds for chromatographic purification. Metabolic classes, such as lipids, peptides, alkaloids, and polyketides were annotated, and octaketide and cytochalasin derivatives were investigated. Cytochalasin H was purified from the cytotoxic Diaporthe sp. CarGL8 extract and its cytotoxic activity was determined on human cancer cell lines A549, MCF-7, and HepG2. The data collected in the present study showed that molecular networking is useful to understand the chemical profile of complex matrices to target compounds, minimizing the cost and time spent in purification processes. © 2022 by the authors.",Santos A.L.; Ionta M.; Horvath R.O.; Soares M.G.; Silva D.O.; Kawafune E.S.; Ferreira M.J.P.; Sartorelli P.,Metabolites,2022,10.3390/metabo12100903,0.97968770782802,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.899652116291525,0.100347883708475,0.999942565999426,5.74340005743412e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
13787,Accumulation of systemic fungicides and other solutes by haustorial complexes isolated from Pisum sativum infected with Erysiphe pisi,"Haustorial complexes, isolated from pea leaves infected with powdery mildew, were incubated with individual 14C‐labelled systemic fungicides or other solutes, and the accumulation of these compounds by the complexes was assessed following filter centrifugation of the products through silicone oil. Inulincarboxylic acid and butyric acid were not absorbed; glucose, sucrose, acetic acid and glycerol were absorbed very slowly by the complexes. All the systemic fungicides, which included nuarimol, fenarimol, dimethirimol, ethirimol, and other pyrimidine‐based analogues, were accumulated against large concentration gradients (30‐1500 fold). The fatty acids, linoleic and lauric, were also readily accumulated. The accumulation of the fatty acids and fungicides was usually complete within 5–15 min. The degree of accumulation of all the solutes was significantly correlated with their lipophilicity, indicating that partitioning of compounds into sub‐cellular lipids was the major mechanism determining accumulation by the complexes. The cations 2‐hydroxyethylarnmonium and 1‐methylpyridinium were also accumulated against large concentration gradients (18‐and 46‐fold, respectively) but less rapidly than the fungicides. The significance of these findings for the systemic distribution and mode of action of fungicides is discussed.

1165,Root-associated fungi not tree density influences stand nitrogen dynamics at the larch forest-tundra ecotone,"Greater tree density and forest productivity at the tundra-taiga ecotone (TTE) are expected with climate warming, with potential feedbacks to the climate system. Yet, competition for nitrogen (N) may impact TTE dynamics. Greater tree density will likely increase N demand, while reducing N supply through soil shading and slower decomposition rates. We explored whether characteristics of roots and root-associated fungi important to N acquisition responded to changes in density at the TTE and were related to above-ground stand productivity and N cycling. We measured rooting depth, uptake of N forms among soil layers and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) colonization and composition along a natural tree density gradient of monodominant larch Larix cajanderi in northeastern Siberia. We tested relationships between larch root and fungal characteristics, above-ground productivity and stand-level N cycling parameters. Overall, there was preferential uptake of ammonium compared to glycine or nitrate. Nitrogen uptake was greatest in shallow soils of the organic horizon and related to root chemistry, root-associated fungi and above-ground N cycling parameters, but the direction of these relationships depended on N form. Uptake of different N forms, rooting depth and EcM colonization and composition were not related to tree density, but fungal composition was correlated with root N chemistry and above-ground N cycling parameters. In addition to EcM, the abundance of dark septate endophytes and other ascomycetous taxa was positively related to N uptake and above-ground N cycling parameters. Synthesis. There was little impact of tree density on root and fungal parameters related to N acquisition suggesting intraspecific larch competition for N was not amplified with increased density. There was, however, a strong impact of root-associated fungi on N uptake and stand N dynamics regardless of tree density. Together, this suggests an important role of root-associated fungi on broadscale patterns of N cycling in TTE larch forests independent of changes in tree density expected with climate warming.","Hewitt, RE; Alexander, HD; Miller, SN; Mack, MC",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2022,10.1111/1365-2745.13882,0.978771565954186,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999846985569832,1.530144301684e-4,0.999999999955826,4.4173886770693097e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16416,Diversity and Antimicrobial Activity of Endophytic Fungi Associated with Houttuynia cordata Thunb,"The study focused on the endophytic fungi associated with Houttuynia cordata Thunb., also known as Fish mint, from four districts of Assam, India. This plant is widely used in traditional medicine to treat various ailments such as dysentery, cold, fever, mumps, etc. The investigation aimed to isolate and identify these fungi from healthy plant tissues and to assess their antimicrobial properties. Sixty-one endophytic fungal isolates were obtained from the leaf, stem, and root tissues of H. cordata. The highest fungal population was recorded in samples from North Lakhimpur district, followed by Nagaon and Kamrup (M) districts. Among the isolated fungi, one particular strain of Trichoderma obtained from Nagaon district showed significant antifungal activity against six test fungal pathogens in vitro. The fungal species was further identified as Trichoderma virens strain MBDM1 through 28S rDNA sequence analysis and molecular phylogeny. The ethyl acetate extract of T. virens was analyzed using GC-MS, revealing the presence of six fungicidal metabolites: 1-H-benzotriazol, Trans,cis-1,7-dimethylspiro[4.5]decane, 2H-Pyrane-2-one-tetrahydro-6-pentyl 4-nitro-, 8-decanoic acid, Thiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazol-3(2H)- one and Cyclotrisiloxane hexamethyl.

15795,"Comparative transcriptome profiling of rice colonized with beneficial endophyte, Piriformospora indica, under high salinity environment","The salinity stress tolerance in plants has been studied enormously, reflecting its agronomic relevance. Despite the extensive research, limited success has been achieved in relation to the plant tolerance mechanism. The beneficial interaction between Piriformospora indica and rice could essentially improve the performance of the plant during salt stress. In this study, the transcriptomic data between P. indica treated and untreated rice roots were compared under control and salt stress conditions. Overall, 661 salt-responsive differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected with 161 up- and 500 down-regulated genes in all comparison groups. Gene ontology analyses indicated the DEGs were mainly enriched in “auxin-activated signaling pathway”, “water channel activity”, “integral component of plasma membrane”, “stress responses”, and “metabolic processes”. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed that the DEGs were primarily related to “Zeatin biosynthesis”, “Fatty acid elongation”, “Carotenoid biosynthesis”, and “Biosynthesis of secondary metabolites”. Particularly, genes related to cell wall modifying enzymes (e.g. invertase/pectin methylesterase inhibitor protein and arabinogalactans), phytohormones (e.g. Auxin-responsive Aux/IAA gene family, ent-kaurene synthase, and 12-oxophytodienoate reductase) and receptor-like kinases (e.g. AGC kinase and receptor protein kinase) were induced in P. indica colonized rice under salt stress condition. The differential expression of these genes implies that the coordination between hormonal crosstalk, signaling, and cell wall dynamics contributes to the higher growth and tolerance in P. indica-inoculated rice. Our results offer a valuable resource for future functional studies on salt-responsive genes that should improve the resilience and adaptation of rice against salt stress. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",Nivedita; Gazara R.K.; Khan S.; Iqrar S.; Ashrafi K.; Abdin M.Z.,Molecular Biology Reports,2020,10.1007/s11033-020-05839-z,0.958213174594537,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.87535034734383,0.12464965265617,0.999999998276108,1.7238920291262602e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

2159,Alpha-mannosidosis caused by toxic plants in ruminants of Argentina,"It is well known that several of the swainsonine-containing plant species found widespread around the world have a negative economic impact in each country. In Argentina, most of the information on the poisonous plant species that produce alpha-mannosidosis is published in Spanish and thus not available to most Englishspeaking researchers interested in toxic plants. Therefore, the aim of this review is to summarize the information about swainsonine-containing plants in Argentina, which are extensively distributed throughout different ecoregions of the country. To date, five species from three genera have been shown to induce alpha-mannosidosis in livestock in Argentina: Ipomoea carnea subsp. fistulosa, Ipomoea hieronymi subsp. calchaquina (Convolvulaceae), Astragalus garbancillo, Astragalus pehuenches (Fabaceae), and Sida rodrigoi (Malvaceae). These species contain the indolizidine alkaloid swainsonine, which inhibits the lysosomal enzyme alpha-mannosidase and consequently affects glycoprotein metabolism, resulting in partially metabolized sugars. The prolonged consumption of these poisonous plants produces progressive weight loss and clinical signs related to a nervous disorder, characterized by tremors of head and neck, abnormalities of gait, difficulty in standing, ataxia and wide-based stance. Histological lesions are mainly characterized by vacuolation of different cells, especially neurons of the central nervous system. The main animal model used to study alpha-mannosidosis is the guinea pig because, when experimentally poisoned, it exhibits many of the characteristics of naturally intoxicated livestock.","Cholich, LA; Martinez, A; Micheloud, JF; Pistán, ME; García, EN; Robles, CA; Ortega, HH; Gimeno, EJ",ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS,2021,10.1590/0001-3765202120191496,0.994173609196503,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999998204245021,1.79575497924069e-6,0.999999999999998,2.1094237467878e-15,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Here, healthy fresh plants of the families Tamaricaceae and Amarantaceae at three saline locations in Iran were investigated for their bioactive endophytic fungi. Among a vast number of isolates, eight isolates were identified as Humicola fuscoatra (Sordariomycetes, Pezizomycotina, Ascomycota) by microscopy and representative DNA sequences of the 5.8S rDNA (ITS) and partial beta-tubulin (TUB2). Those isolates were halotolerant, and highly bioactive, so that their intra- and extra-cellular metabolites possessed in vitro antifungal, antibacterial and antiproliferative activities, against a number of fungal and bacterial plant pathogens including the fungi Arthrobotrys conoides, Pyrenophora graminea, Pyricularia grisea and the bacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas oryzae.

The endophytic fungi in the root system of V. uliginosum in different site types had the specificity. Among them, the mountain land type and the meadow bog with soil layer type were dominated by Phialocephala, while the dominant species of the meadow bog permafrost soil layer type was Meliniomyces. 2) Among the three site types, the endophytic fungi diversity and infection rate were the highest in the meadow bog permafrost soil layer type, followed by the mountain land type, and the meadow bog with soil layer type was lowest. The content of most mineral elements in the three site types showed the same trend as that root endophytic fungi diversity and infection rate, with the exception of Zn element in V. uliginosum. 3) The endophytic fungi infection rate was significantly or extremely significantly positively correlated with N, P, K, Ca and Fe content, but had an extremely negative correlation with Zn content (r=-0.944**). Conclusion: The endophytic fungi can significantly promote the mineral nutrient accumulation of V. uliginosum, suggesting that the endophytic fungi colonization is an important factor affecting the mineral nutrient status of V. uliginosum, and the environmental conditions was important factor influencing the diversity and abundance of endophytic fungi in V. uliginosum roots. © 2017, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

3151,Endophytic Consortium With Diverse Gene-Regulating Capabilities of Benzylisoquinoline Alkaloids Biosynthetic Pathway Can Enhance Endogenous Morphine Biosynthesis in Papaver somniferum,"Secondary metabolite biosynthesis in medicinal plants is multi-step cascade known to be modulated by associated endophytes. While a single endophyte is not able to upregulate all biosynthetic steps, limiting maximum yield achievement. Therefore to compliment the deficient characteristics in an endophyte we tried consortium of endophytes to achieve maximum yield. Here, efforts were made to maximize the in planta morphine yield, using consortium of two endophytes; SM1B (Acinetobacter sp.) upregulating most of the genes of morphine biosynthesis except T6ODM and CODM, and SM3B (Marmoricola sp.) upregulating T6ODM and CODM in alkaloidless Papaver somniferum cv. Sujata. Consortium-inoculation significantly increased morphine and thebaine content, and also increased the photosynthetic efficiency of poppy plants resulted in increased biomass, capsule weight, and seed yields compared to single-inoculation. The increment in morphine content was due to the modulation of metabolic-flow of key intermediates including reticuline and thebaine, via upregulating pertinent biosynthetic genes and enhanced expression of COR, key gene for morphine biosynthesis. This is the first report demonstrating the endophytic-consortium complimenting the functional deficiency of one endophyte by another for upregulating multiple genes of a metabolic pathway similar to transgenics (overexpressing multiple genes) for obtaining enhanced yield of pharmaceutically important metabolites.","Ray, T; Pandey, SS; Pandey, A; Srivastava, M; Shanker, K; Kalra, A",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2019,10.3389/fmicb.2019.00925,0.858350102965453,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999992070349413,7.9296505870296e-6,0.999999999945517,5.4483195732757395e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16062,Insight into the composition and differentiation of endophytic microbial communities in kernels via 368 maize transcriptomes,"Introduction: Kernels are important reproductive organs in maize, yet there is a lack of systematic investigation on the differences in the composition of endophytic microorganisms in plants from a population perspective. Objectives: We aimed to elucidate the composition of endophytic microorganisms in developing maize kernels, emphasizing differences among various inbred lines. Methods: The transcriptomic data of 368 maize inbred lines were used to explore the composition and diversity of endophytic microorganisms. Results: The findings revealed a higher abundance of fungi than bacteria in developing maize kernels, followed by protozoa, while viruses were less abundant. There were significant differences in the composition and relative abundance of endophytic microorganisms among different maize lines. Diversity analysis revealed overall similarity in the community composition structure between tropical/subtropical (TST) and temperate (NSS) maize germplasm with apparent variations in community richness and abundance. The endophytic microorganisms network in the kernels from TST genotypes exhibited higher connectivity and stability compared to NSS kernels. Bacteria dominated the highly connected species in the networks, and different core species showed microbial phylum specificity. Some low-abundance species acted as core species, contributing to network stability. Beneficial bacteria were predominant in the core species of networks in TST kernels, while pathogenic bacteria were more abundant in the core species of networks in NSS kernels. Conclusion: Tropical maize germplasm may have advantages in resisting the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms, providing excellent genetic resources for disease-resistant breeding. © 2024",Tao F.; Chen F.; Liu H.; Chen C.; Cheng B.; Han G.,Journal of Advanced Research,2025,10.1016/j.jare.2024.05.018,0.947089637798328,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.721336110685283,0.278663889314717,0.999956619406599,4.33805934014764e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

13041,Tree species as hosts for arbuscular mycorrhizal and dark septate endophyte fungi,"A survey of 35 tree species (belonging to 28 genera in 19 families) in Aliyar, South India was carried out to ascertain their arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and dark septate endophyte (DSE) fungal status. All the tree species examined had AM association. AM and DSE colonization is reported for the first time in 20 and 14 species respectively. Cooccurrence of AM and DSE was observed in 14 (40%) tree species. The extent of DSE colonization was inversely related to the extent of AM fungal colonization. Six tree species had Arum-type, 18 had intermediatetype and 11 had typical Paris-type AM morphology. AM fungal spore morphotypes belonging to 11 species in two genera were isolated from the rhizosphere soil. AM fungal spore numbers were not related to the extent of AM colonization and Glomus dominated spore diversity. AM association individually and along with DSE were found respectively in the 63% and 44% of the economically important tree species. The occurrence of AM and DSE fungal association in economically important indigenous tree species indicates the possibility of exploiting this association in future conservation programmes of these species. © 2012 Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Uma E.; Sathiyadash K.; Loganathan J.; Muthukumar T.,Journal of Forestry Research,2012,10.1007/s11676-012-0267-z,0.959007398224773,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.859568216835369,0.140431783164631,0.999999519512335,4.80487664988871e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
18252,Fungal Endophytes: Beyond Herbivore Management.,"The incorporation of entomopathogenic fungi as biocontrol agents into Integrated Pest Management (IPM) programs without doubt, has been highly effective. The ability of these fungal pathogens such as Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae to exist as endophytes in plants and protect their colonized host plants against the primary herbivore pests has widely been reported. Aside this sole role of pest management that has been traditionally ascribed to fungal endophytes, recent findings provided evidence of other possible functions as plant yield promoter, soil nutrient distributor, abiotic stress and drought tolerance enhancer in plants. However, reports on these additional important effects of fungal endophytes on the colonized plants remain scanty. In this review, we discussed the various beneficial effects of endophytic fungi on the host plants and their primary herbivore pests; as well as some negative effects that are relatively unknown. We also highlighted the prospects of our findings in further increasing the acceptance of fungal endophytes as an integral part of pest management programs for optimized crop production.",Bamisile BS; Dash CK; Akutse KS; Keppanan R; Wang L,Frontiers in microbiology,2018,10.3389/fmicb.2018.00544,0.929152811129133,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.635128368388001,0.364871631611999,0.999989397845299,1.06021547007229e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
7329,"Enhancing dendrobine production in Dendrobium nobile through mono-culturing of endophytic fungi, Trichoderma longibrachiatum (MD33) in a temporary immersion bioreactor system","Introduction Dendrobine, a valuable alkaloid found in Dendrobium nobile, possesses significant pharmaceutical potential. Methods In this study, we explored innovative approaches to enhance dendrobine production by utilizing endophytic fungi in a Temporary Immersion Bioreactor System (TIBS, Nanjing BioFunction Co. Ltd., China) and traditional test bottles. Dendrobine was unequivocally identified and characterised in D. nobile co-culture seedlings through UHPLC analysis and LC-MS qTOF analysis, supported by reference standards. Results The CGTB (control group) and EGTB (experimental group) 12-month-old D. nobile seedlings exhibited similar peak retention times at 7.6 +/- 0.1 minutes, with dendrobine identified as C16H25NO2 (molecular weight 264.195). The EGTB, co-cultured with Trichoderma longibrachiatum (MD33), displayed a 2.6-fold dendrobine increase (1804.23 ng/ml) compared to the CGTB (685.95 ng/ml). Furthermore, a bioanalytical approach was applied to investigate the mono-culture of T. longibrachiatum MD33 with or without D. nobile seedlings in test bottles. The newly developed UHPLC-MS method allowed for dendrobine identification at a retention time of 7.6 +/- 0.1 minutes for control and 7.6 +/- 0.1 minutes for co-culture. Additionally, we explored TIBS to enhance dendrobine production. Co-culturing D. nobile seedlings with Trichoderma longibrachiatum (MD33) in the TIBS system led to a substantial 9.7-fold dendrobine increase (4415.77 ng/ml) compared to the control (454.01 ng/ml) after just 7 days. The comparative analysis of dendrobine concentration between EGTB and EGTIBS highlighted the remarkable potential of TIBS for optimizing dendrobine production. Future research may focus on scaling up the TIBS approach for commercial dendrobine production and investigating the underlying mechanisms for enhanced dendrobine biosynthesis in D. nobile. The structural elucidation of dendrobine was achieved through H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy, revealing a complex array of proton environments and distinct carbon environments, providing essential insights for the comprehensive characterization of the compound. Discussion These findings hold promise for pharmaceutical and industrial applications of dendrobine and underline the role of endophytic fungi in enhancing secondary metabolite production in medicinal plants.","Sarsaiya, S; Jain, A; Shu, FX; Yang, MF; Pu, MX; Jia, Q; Gong, QH; Wu, Q; Qian, X; Shi, JS; Chen, JS",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2024,10.3389/fpls.2024.1302817,0.985926977568843,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998857755339649,0.0011422446603505,0.999999995708153,4.2918474330022605e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3280,Organic nitrogen use by salal ericoid mycorrhizal fungi from northern Vancouver Island and impacts on growth in vitro of Gaultheria shallon,"Salal (Gaultheria shallon) recovers quickly from rhizomes after clear-cut timber harvesting and dominates clearcuts of Tsuga heterophylla and Thuja plicata forests. Thus it contributes to considerable problems in regeneration of these sites in coastal British Columbia, Canada. Based on what is known about other ericaceous plants, we speculated that mycorrhizal fungi of salal play a vital role in the growth and dominance of salal by providing access to organic nitrogen. In this study, the ability of four species of fungi isolated from salal to use different forms of organic nitrogen was tested in pure culture and in association with salal. The organic forms of nitrogen applied were glutamine tan amino acid), glutathione (a peptide), and bovine serum albumin (BSA, a protein). The fungi tested were Oidiodendron maius, Acremonium strictum. and two nonsporulating fungi. Inoculated plants always grew better than noninoculated plants regardless of nitrogen source. Glutamine was used as readily as ammonium nitrogen by all four fungi and the mycorrhizal plants of salal colonized by those fungi. There was considerable variation between fungus species or the plants inoculated with those fungi in using glutathione and BSA. Salal inoculated with O. maius grew better on glutathione than BSA, while A, strictum and unknown 1 produced significantly greater yields of salal on BSA. Colonization rates of salal by all four fungi was higher on glutathione or BSA than on ammonium or glutamine.","Xiao, GP; Berch, SM",MYCORRHIZA,1999,10.1007/s005720050299,0.975913735968072,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996075766787283,0.00392423321271655,0.999999999201092,7.989081618475781e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
17911,"Bacterial communities in the rhizosphere, phyllosphere and endosphere of tomato plants.","Plants harbor diverse bacterial communities, which play crucial roles in plant health and growth, in their rhizosphere, phyllosphere and endosphere. Tomato is an important model for studying plant-microbe interactions, but comparison of its associated bacterial community is still lacking. In this study, using Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons, we characterized and compared the bacterial size and community from rootzone soil as well as the rhizosphere, phyllosphere and endosphere of roots, stems, leaves, fruits and seeds of tomato plants that were grown in greenhouse conditions. Habitat (soil, phyllospheric, and endophytic) structured the community. The bacterial communities from the soil-type samples (rootzone soil and rhizosphere) showed the highest richness and diversity. The lowest bacterial diversity occurred in the phyllospheric samples, while the lowest richness occurred in the endosphere. Among the endophytic samples, both bacterial diversity and richness varied in different tissues, with the highest values in roots. The most abundant phyla in the tomato-associated community was Proteobacteria, with the exception of the seeds and jelly, where both Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were dominant. At the genus level, the sequences of Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter were prevalent in the rhizosphere, and in the phyllosphere, more than 97% of the sequences were assigned to Acinetobacter. For the endophytes, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, and Pseudomonas were the abundant genera in the roots, stems and leaves. In the fruits, the bacterial endophytes varied in different compartments, with Enterobacter being enriched in the pericarp and seeds, Acinetobacter in the placenta, and Weissella in the jelly. The present data provide a comprehensive description of the tomato-associated bacterial community and will be useful for better understanding plant-microbe interactions and selecting suitable bacterial taxa for tomato production.",Dong CJ; Wang LL; Li Q; Shang QM,PloS one,2019,10.1371/journal.pone.0223847,0.919595505142619,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.32272006722224,0.67727993277776,0.996019704089978,0.0039802959100218,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
126,A New Source of Diterpene Lactones From Andrographis paniculata (Burm. f.) Nees-Two Endophytic Fungi of Colletotrichum sp. With Antibacterial and Antioxidant Activities,"Endophytic fungi of medicinal plants are abundant, and their metabolites often have antioxidant, antibacterial, and antitumor effects and can produce secondary metabolites identical or similar to those of their hosts, which can mitigate the problem of insufficient supply of medicinal plants. In this study, we screened endophytic fungi for strains that produce the same diterpene lactones as Andrographis paniculata based on their biological activity. Firstly, the dominant group of endophytic fungi of Andrographis paniculata was screened and pathogenicity was studied using Koch's rule. Secondly, DPPH, ABTS, OH, PTIO radical scavenging, and FRAP assays were used to detect the antioxidant activity of the extracellular extracts of the strains, and total phenol and total flavonoid contents of the strains with high antioxidant capacity were determined. S. aureus, B. subtilis, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa were used to determine the antibacterial activity of the mycelial extracts of the strains. Finally, the secondary metabolites of the mycelial extracts of the strains were examined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that 32 strains of Andrographis paniculata were relatively isolated > 70% and non-pathogenic. Extracellular extracts of strains AP-1 and AP-4 showed vigorous antioxidant activity, and AP-4, AP-12, AP-47, and AP-48 showed antibacterial activity against four strains of bacteria. The HPLC results indicated that the mycelial extracts of AP-4 and AP-12 contained diterpene lactones. The two endophytic fungi were recognized as Colletotrichum sp. The study successfully obtained diterpene lactones from the endophytic fungus of Andrographis paniculata and confirmed the feasibility of using endophytic fungal strains to produce active substances consistent with the host. It was also useful for exploring endophytic fungi and medicinal plants. The relationship provides theoretical guidance.","Li, N; Xu, D; Huang, RH; Zheng, JY; Liu, YY; Hu, BS; Gu, YQ; Du, Q",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2022,10.3389/fmicb.2022.819770,0.985384101964389,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.941842721689226,0.0581572783107737,0.999999999658611,3.4138858406862503e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
9720,Biodiversity of palm fungi in the tropics:: are global fungal diversity estimates realistic?,"Two questions are addressed: 'How many species of fungi can occur on a single host palm?' and 'What are the implications of this for global estimates of fungal diversity?' Fungal diversity estimates found in the literature are reviewed. Data on the numbers of fungi occurring on the above-ground tissues of six individual palms in the genus Licuala in Australia and Brunei Darussalam (Borneo) are provided. A total of 189 species of fungi were isolated and/or collected from the six palms. In addition, 53 'morphospecies' of mycelia sterilia were isolated, giving a total of 242 taxa from the 2672 isolates/collections made. The three palms in Australia (sampled once) yielded 100 species (each palm supporting an average of 54.7 taxa), while the three palms in Brunei Darussalam (sampled three times) yielded 172 species in total (approximately 111.3 taxa each). The magnitude of global fungal diversity, estimated at 1.5 million species, is discussed. Our results indicate that 33 to 1 would be a more accurate estimate (than 5.7 to 1) of the ratio of host specific fungal to palm species in the tropics. We therefore propose that global estimates of fungal diversity, based on temperate studies, require revision upwards.","Fröhlich, J; Hyde, KD",BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,1999,10.1023/A:1008895913857,0.972828097978482,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999959485612651,4.05143873493953e-5,0.99999998266799,1.73320102714314e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

16711,First Report of Bacterial Leaf Spot of Spinach Caused by a Pseudomonas syringae Pathovar in California.,"In 2000 and 2001, a new disease was observed on commercial spinach (Spinacia oleracea) in the Salinas Valley, Monterey County, CA. Initial symptoms were water-soaked, irregularly shaped leaf spots (2 to 3 mm diameter). As the disease developed, spots enlarged to as much as 1 to 2 cm, were vein-delimited, and turned dark brown. Faint chlorotic halos sometimes surrounded the spots. Death of large areas of the leaf occurred if spots coalesced. Spots were visible from the adaxial and abaxial sides of leaves, and no fungal structures were observed. The disease occurred on newly expanded and mature foliage. No fungi were isolated from the spots. However, cream-colored bacterial colonies were consistently isolated on sucrose peptone agar, and these strains were nonfluorescent on King's medium B. Strains were positive for levan and negative for oxidase, arginine dihydrolase, and nitrate reductase. Strains did not grow at 36°C, did not rot potato slices, but induced a hypersensitive reaction in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Turk). These results suggested the bacterium was similar to Pseudomonas syringae. Fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis (MIS-TSBA 4.10, MIDI Inc., Newark, DE) indicated the strains were highly similar (80.1 to 89.3%) to P. syringae pv. maculicola. However, in contrast to P. syringae pv. maculicola, the spinach strains did not utilize the carbon sources erythritol, L+tartrate, L lactate, and DL-homoserine. Pathogenicity of 10 strains was tested by growing inoculum in nutrient broth shake cultures for 48 h, diluting to 106 CFU/ml, and spraying 4-week-old plants of spinach cv. Bossanova. Control plants were sprayed with sterile nutrient broth. After 5 to 8 days in a greenhouse (24 to 26°C), leaf spots identical to those observed in the field developed on cotyledons and true leaves of inoculated plants. Strains were reisolated from the spots and identified as P. syringae. Control plants remained symptomless. The 10 strains were also inoculated on beet (Beta vulgaris), Swiss chard (Beta vulgaris subsp. cicla), cilantro (Coriandrum sativum), and spinach. Spinach showed leaf spots after 8 days; however, none of the other plants developed symptoms. Two strains were inoculated onto spinach cvs. Califlay, Lion, Nordic IV, Polka, Resistoflay, Rushmore, RZ 11, Spinnaker, Springfield, Viroflay, and Whitney. Leaf spot developed on all cultivars, and the pathogen was reisolated. Because the FAME data indicated a similarity between the spinach pathogen and P. syringae pv. maculicola, we inoculated sets of spinach cv. Bolero, cabbage (Brassica oleracea subsp. capitata cv. Grenedere), and cauliflower (Brassica oleracea subsp. botrytis cv. White Rock) with three P. syringae pv. maculicola and three spinach strains. Cabbage and cauliflower developed leaf spots only when inoculated with P. syringae pv. maculicola; spinach had leaf spots only when inoculated with the spinach strains. All inoculation experiments were done twice, and the results of the two tests were the same. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bacterial leaf spot of spinach in California caused by a nonfluorescent P. syringae, and the first record of this disease in the United States. Biochemical characteristics and limited host range of the pathogen indicate the California strains are likely the same as the P. syringae pv. spinaciae pathogen that was reported in Italy (1) and Japan (2).

11269,"Narrow mycorrhizae and large non-mycorrhizal fungal diversity associated with roots of Cattleya milleri, an endemic and endangered orchid from a rupestrian hotspot in the ""Quadrilátero Ferrífero"" of Minas Gerais - Brazil","The threatened orchid Cattleya milleri is a microendemic orchid of a Brazilian savanna hotspot. As endophytes and mycorrhizae may improve its propagation and conservation, we investigated its root fungal community. Cattleya milleri roots were sampled in five natural sites and at a greenhouse. Fungal root endophytes were isolated for characterization and molecular ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) identification. Total DNA was extracted from endorhiza and rhizosphere for ITS amplification and sequencing. Sixteen fungal isolates were clustered in 6 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and endorhizal and rhizospheric sequences were clustered in 327 OTUs. Endorhiza presented from 25 to 89 OTUs, and rhizosphere 56 OTUs. Cluster analysis showed high divergence between natural and greenhouse fungal communities, but similarity among natural samples. From the 94 genera, 24 were annotated as endophytes, two mycorrhizas, 33 pathotrophs, 40 saprotrophs, and 17 symbiotrophs based on the FunGuild database.

1936,Antioxidants in Festuca rubra L. seeds affected by the fungal symbiont Epichloe festucae,"Vertically transmitted fungal endophytes can be beneficial for host grasses. While the alkaloid-mediated mechanism for herbivore resistance has been widely studied, underlying physiological mechanisms for increased tolerance to abiotic stress remain scarcely explored. In this study we used three maternal lines of perennial grass Festuca rubra to examine the role of antioxidants in endophyte-mediated effects on seed viability over long-term storage. Uncolonized plants (E-) were generated by removing the endophyte from ramets of naturally endophyte-colonized (E+) plants. The E + and E- ramets were planted in a common garden in Salamanca, Spain. Seeds produced in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were harvested at maturity, dried and stored at 10 A degrees C until 2011 when we tested seed and endophyte viability, and measured antioxidants. Seed viability and alpha-tocopherol antioxidant were negatively affected by the endophyte in two maternal lines. In these same lines, the endophyte viability was lowest at the longest storage time. In the maternal line that showed the highest negative effect of endophyte on seed viability, the pattern of glutathione was opposite to that observed for tocopherols since it was higher for E + than for E- seeds. In all maternal lines, the glutathione half-cell reduction potential (E-GSSG/2GSH) and % glutathione disulphide (GSSG) increased with storage time but there was no clear pattern associated with endophyte symbiosis. Whether these parameters are good predictors of seed and endophyte longevity in storage and natural conditions should be further explored.","Gundel, PE; Hamilton, CE; Seal, CE; Helander, M; Martinez-Ghersa, MA; Ghersa, CM; de Aldana, BRV; Zabalgogeazcoa, I; Saikkonen, K",SYMBIOSIS,2012,10.1007/s13199-012-0194-y,0.961327776068374,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99544124741323,0.00455875258677039,0.999999533457984,4.665420159089e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16276,Endophytic microbial diversity associated with commercial cultivar and crop wild relative banana variety could provide clues for microbial community management,"Endophytes, microorganisms inhabiting internal plant tissues, play a pivotal role in plant growth and disease resistance. Moreover, previous studies have established that Musa plants derive disease protective functions from their microbiome. Notably, one of the crop wild relatives of banana, the Calcutta 4 variety, exhibits resistance to various phytopathogens such as Pseudocercospora fijiensis (P. fijiensis), while the Williams commercial cultivar (cv.) is highly susceptible. Therefore, this study aims primarily to characterize and compare the endophytic microbiota composition of Calcutta 4 and Williams banana plants when grown sympatrically. Alongside, differences in endophytic microbiome between plant sections (shoot or roots), growth phases (in vitro or greenhouse) and fitness factors such as the addition of plant growth-promoting bacteria Bacillus subtilis EA-CB0575 (T2 treatment) or infection by P. fijiensis (T3 treatment) were examined. Both culture-dependent and -independent techniques were used to evaluate these differences and assess the culturability of banana endophytes under varying conditions. Microbial cultures resulted in 331 isolates distributed across 54 genera when all treatments were evaluated, whereas 16 S sequencing produced 9510 ASVs assigned in 1456 genera. Alpha and beta diversity exhibited significant differences based on plant section, with an increase in phylogenetic diversity observed in plants with pathogen infection (T3) compared to control plants (T1). Additionally, four differentially abundant genera associated with nitrogen metabolism were identified in T3 plants and seven genera showed differential abundance when comparing varieties. When culture-dependent and -independent methods were compared, it was found that isolates represented 3.7 % of the genera detected by culture-independent methods, accounting for 12–41 % of the total data depending on the treatment. These results are crucial for proposing management strategies derived from crop wild relatives to enhance the resilience of susceptible commercial varieties against fitness factors affecting crop development. Additionally, they help to decipher the pathogenic effects of P. fijiensis in banana plants and advance the understanding of how plant domestication influences the endosphere. © 2024 The Authors",Posada L.F.; Arteaga-Figueroa L.A.; Adarve-Rengifo I.; Cadavid M.; Zapata S.; Álvarez J.C.,Microbiological Research,2024,10.1016/j.micres.2024.127862,0.926244473515333,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990971910284222,0.00902808971577795,0.999990030682834,9.96931716612526e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12034,Establishment of Beauveria bassiana as a fungal endophyte in pecan (Carya illinoinensis) seedlings and its virulence against pecan insect pests,"Pecan (Carya illinoinensis) is an important crop in the USA, which produces approximately 55% of the world's pecans. Several insect pests and various plant diseases reduce crop yield directly destroying nutmeats, or indirectly through effects on foliage and shucks, reducing photosynthesis. Beauveria bassiana is a well-studied, commercialized fungal entomopathogen that when applied inundatively is an effective biocontrol agent against certain pecan pests. In addition to being used in inundative biocontrol, B. bassiana can exist as an endophyte in many plant species and has been shown in some cases to reduce pest damage when present as an endophyte. The potential for B. bassiana to exist as an endophyte in pecan had not been explored previously. We tested whether B. bassiana could endophytically colonize pecan seedlings by seed soaking, seed coating and soil drenching. Results indicated that B. bassiana became established in the roots, leaves and stems of pecan seedlings. Establishment was verified using molecular techniques as well as completing Koch's postulates on the re-isolated fungus, infecting two susceptible insect hosts (Galleria mellonella and Tenebrio molitor) and a target pest (Curculio caryae). Subsequently we explored whether the established endophytic fungus suppressed two pecan aphid species. In a leaf-disc assay, populations of two pecan aphids (Melanocallis caryaefoliae and Monellia caryella) were reduced when placed on leaves of pecan that were colonized endophytically with B. bassiana, relative to control leaves. Our study demonstrates the ability to establish endophytic B. bassiana in pecan and the potential to apply this capability in pecan pest management. Additional research is needed to determine the utility of the endophytic approach against various insect and plant pathogens and to measure efficacy under field conditions.","Ramakuwela, T; Hatting, J; Bock, C; Vega, FE; Wells, L; Mbata, GN; Shapiro-Ilan, D",BIOLOGICAL CONTROL,2020,10.1016/j.biocontrol.2019.104102,0.882146328761197,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998945978427671,0.00105402157232935,0.999999999598867,4.01133126715081e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

At 2.5 g a.i.[active ingredient]/kg the seed-borne fungus was usually eliminated from samples with up to 61.5% affected seeds (35.5% internally diseased) but higher levels of infection required increased doses for complete eradication of the fungus. The germination of healthy seeds, including samples from 7 yr old stocks, on filter paper was unaffected by the treatment. However, the germination of diseased samples, particularly those internally infected with A. brassicicola, was improved. More seedlings emerged from iprodione treated than from untreated seeds in glasshouse soil but the differences were not significant. The application of .gamma.-hexachlorocyclohexane to iprodione treated seeds sown in soil did not adversely affect subsequent emergence or disease control. Disease control was maintained and germination was not affected by the treatment when treated infected seeds were stored for 2 yr at 10.degree. C, 50% r.h. [relative humidity].

21202,Chemical and phytochemical composition of moringa seed powder and antifungal activity of seed extracts against seed borne fungi,"The aim of the current study were to determine the quality of Moringa oleifera seeds and to detect the in-vitro antifungal activity of seed extracts and their phytochemical and elemental composition. Seeds of moringa recently collected or stored for one to three years were contaminated with fungi with an average of 48.44% on PDA medium. The percentage of fungal infection was higher in seeds produced during season of 2011(stored for 3 years), followed by seeds produced at season of 2012 with significant difference (87.50 and 50.00% respectively). Moringa seeds recently collected during season of 2014 showed low fungal densities than the corresponding figures of stored seeds for 1-3 years. Fourteen species which belong to nine genera were detected and they were classified as, Alternaria alternata (11.82%), Aspergillus candidus (4.32%), A. flavus (6.34%), A. niger (14.46%), A. regulosus (1.87%), A. sydowi (3.08%), A. terreus (6.09%), Chaetomium globosum (7.55%), Fusarium solani (2.35%), Helminthosporium sp. (5.97%), Macrophomina phaseolina (6.88), Nigrospora sphaericica (16.69%), Rhizoctonia solani (4.19%) and Rhizopus nigricans (8.35). The ethanolic seed extract was found to be more effective than the water extract. The ethanolic seed extract at 100% cause increase in zone of inhibition in all tested fungi reaching 2.70-3.77mm, whereas, at 50% concentration reaching between 1.40-1.93mm. The aqueous extract of moringa seeds at 100% concentration showed moderate activity against all tested fungi (inhibition zone between 0.43-1.33 mm) compared with the standard fungicide (inhibition zone 4.23 - 4.90 mm). The results of the phytochemical analysis revealed differences in the presence of components among the seed extracts. The total phenol was decreased from 7.00 to 3.19 mg/g (54.4% decrease) and total flavonoids from 0.697 to 0.550 mg/g (21.09 decrease) in moringa recently collected (2014) and stored seeds for 3 years respectively. The percentage of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium were high in recently collected seeds than in the stored seeds, as the percentages were 5.6, 0.64 and 1.18 % in recently collected seeds respectively and reduced to 5.1, 0.91 and 1.11 % respectively in old seeds for 3 years. GC/MS analysis of recent collected moringa and stored seed extracts led to the identification of different compounds. Extract of recent collected seeds during season 2014 contained some compounds varied in their chemical composition and molecular weight than old seeds of 3 years. © 2015, Sphinx Knowledge House.

18615,Beneficial role of bacterial endophytes in heavy metal phytoremediation.,"Phytoremediation is an emerging technology that uses plants and their associated microbes to clean up pollutants from the soil, water and air. In recent years, phytoremediation assisted by bacterial endophytes has been highly recommended for cleaning up of metal polluted soils since endophytic bacteria can alleviate metal toxicity in plant through their own metal resistance system and facilitate plant growth under metal stress. Endophytic bacteria improve plant growth in metal polluted soils in two different ways: 1) directly by producing plant growth beneficial substances including solubilization/transformation of mineral nutrients (phosphate, nitrogen and potassium), production of phytohormones, siderophores and specific enzymes; and 2) indirectly through controlling plant pathogens or by inducing a systemic resistance of plants against pathogens. Besides, they also alter metal accumulation capacity in plants by excreting metal immobilizing extracellular polymeric substances, as well as metal mobilizing organic acids and biosurfactants.

13802,"Photolysis, metabolism and other factors influencing the performance of triadimefon as a powdery mildew fungicide","Triadimefon, 1‐(4‐chlorophenoxy)‐3,3‐dimethyl‐1‐( 1,2,4‐triazol‐1‐yl)butanone, applied at low dosage rates to leaves of marrow, apple or barley plants gave effective control of the appropriate powdery mildew fungi. The compound appeared to be systemic and to have considerable vapour‐phase activity. In marrow plants, up to 56% of triadimefon was metabolised to a mixture of two corresponding diastereoisomeric secondary alcohols. The mixture was identical with that obtained by chemical reduction of triadimefon. This mixture was also a very effective systemic fungicide and active in the vapour‐phase. Triadimefon was also reduced when incubated with Aspergillus niger but this was important only in shake culture. In replacement culture experiments, mycelial mats of this fungus converted the compound into a different metabolite, its isopropyl analogue. This may have resulted from participation of triadimefon in the C‐4 demethylation processes involved in fungal biosynthesis of ergosterol. Photolysis caused cleavage of the C‐1 to triazole bond liberating 1,2,4‐triazole, 4‐chlorophenol and 4‐chlorophenyl methyl carbonate, all of which were non‐fungitoxic. The importance of this photolysis in the in‐vivo situation is discussed.

10558,The root endophytic fungus Trichoderma atroviride induces foliar herbivory resistance in maize plants,"Plant roots naturally associate with Trichoderma spp., which can promote plant health and nutrition. Despite that Trichoderma spp. are well-known biocontrol agents, information on their effects against foliar insect herbivory is limited. Here, we examined the effects of T. atroviride in providing maize (Zea mays) resistance against the insect herbivore Spodoptera frugiperda. Increased plant growth, reduced herbivory and altered insect feeding pattern were observed after maize inoculation with T. atroviride. Plant protection was correlated with increased emission of volatile terpenes and accumulation of jasmonic acid, an activator of defense responses against herbivory. Chemical analyses revealed that T. atroviride produced the volatiles 1-octen-3-ol and 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one. Pharmacological tests showed that both compounds reduced the consumption of foliar tissue and altered the feeding pattern of S. frugiperda in a similar way to T. atroviride. These results provide new insight into the role of T. atroviride in plant health in terms of induction of resistance to insect herbivory and production of antifeedant secondary metabolites.","Contreras-Cornejo, HA; Macías-Rodríguez, L; Del-Val, E; Larsen, J",APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,2018,10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.10.004,0.957845637030036,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.626419027964273,0.373580972035727,0.999736849230091,2.6315076990901e-4,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

502,Comparative Metabolomics Revealed the Potential Antitumor Characteristics of Four Endophytic Fungi of Brassica rapa L.,"Endophytic fungi of medicinal plants have attracted wide attention due to their various active biochemical substances that are similar to those of the host plants and can be easily fermented and cultured. As a traditional medicine and food homologous plant in Xinjiang, Brassica rapa L. has a long history of applications. Recently, it has been shown that B. rapa L. has hypoglycemic, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant properties. However, there are no studies on the function and diversity of enophytic fungi of B. rapa L. Four endophytic fungus (pr6, pr7, pr8, and pr10) strains were isolated from B. rapa L. in our laboratory. The metabolic extracts from pr10 have significant effects in terms of antitumor activity. In this study, in terms of types and contents, compared with those of the other three endophytic fungi, the dominant metabolites of pr10 were determined by comparative metabolomics analysis. The results of metabolomics analysis indicated that the metabolites of pr10 are rich in amino acids and sugar derivatives such as trehalose, whose ability to inhibit the A549 cell line has been proved.

3815,The Apoplastic Secretome of Trichoderma virens During Interaction With Maize Roots Shows an Inhabition of Plant Defence and Scavenging Oxidative Stress Secreted Proteins,"In Nature, almost every plant is colonized by fungi. Trichoderma virens is a biocontrol fungus which has the capacity to behave as an opportunistic plant endophyte. Even though many plants are colonized by this symbiont, the exact mechanisms by which Trichoderma masks its entrance into its plant host remain unknown, but likely involve the secretion of different families of proteins into the apoplast that may play crucial roles in the suppression of plant immune responses. In this study, we investigated T. virens colonization of maize roots under hydroponic conditions, evidencing inter- and intracellular colonization by the fungus and modifications in root morphology and coloration. Moreover, we show that upon host penetration, T. virens secretes into the apoplast an arsenal of proteins to facilitate inter- and intracellular colonization of maize root tissues. Using a gel-free shotgun proteomics approach, 95 and 43 secretory proteins were identified from maize and T. virens, respectively. A reduction in the maize secretome (36%) was induced by T. virens, including two major groups, glycosyl hydrolases and peroxidases. Furthermore, T. virens secreted proteins were mainly involved in cell wall hydrolysis, scavenging of reactive oxygen species and secondary metabolism, as well as putative effector-like proteins. Levels of peroxidase activity were reduced in the inoculated roots, suggesting a strategy used by T. virens to manipulate host immune responses. The results provide an insight into the crosstalk in the apoplast which is essential to maintain the T. virens-plant interaction.","Nogueira-Lopez, G; Greenwood, DR; Middleditch, M; Winefield, C; Eaton, C; Steyaert, JM; Mendoza-Mendoza, A",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2018,10.3389/fpls.2018.00409,0.602097003170361,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.950506156118557,0.0494938438814433,0.999999998933096,1.0669042316280301e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
962,Antarctic root endophytes improve physiological performance and yield in crops under salt stress by enhanced energy production and Na<SUP>+</SUP> sequestration,"Climatic change is pointed as one of the major challenges for global food security. Based on current models of climate change, reduction in precipitations and in turn, increase in the soil salinity will be a sharp constraint for crops productivity worldwide. In this context, root fungi appear as a new strategy to improve plant ecophysiological performance and crop yield under abiotic stress. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the two fungal endophytes Penicillium brevicompactum and P. chrysogenum isolated from Antarctic plants on nutrients and Na+ contents, net photosynthesis, water use efficiency, yield and survival in tomato and lettuce, facing salinity stress conditions. Inoculation of plant roots with fungal endophytes resulted in greater fresh and dry biomass production, and an enhanced survival rate under salt conditions. Inoculation of plants with the fungal endophytes was related with a higher up/down-regulation of ion homeostasis by enhanced expression of the NHX1 gene. The two endophytes diminished the effects of salt stress in tomato and lettuce, provoked a higher efficiency in photosynthetic energy production and an improved sequestration of Na+ in vacuoles is suggested by the upregulating of the expression of vacuolar NHX1 Na+/H+ antiporters. Promoting plant-beneficial interactions with root symbionts appears to be an environmentally friendly strategy to mitigate the impact of climate change variables on crop production.","Molina-Montenegro, MA; Acuña-Rodríguez, IS; Torres-Díaz, C; Gundel, PE; Dreyer, I",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2020,10.1038/s41598-020-62544-4,0.982339389372977,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985972249467828,0.0140277505321719,0.999996653103054,3.34689694603263e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15696,Endophyte Fusarium lateritium showing potato growth promotion and disease resistance and the construction of its genetic transformation system; [对马铃薯具促生抗病作用的砖红镰刀菌及其遗传转化体系构建],"A fungus was isolated from the petals of medicinal plant Nothapodytes pittosporoides. ITS molecular identification showed that the fungus was genetically very close to Fusarium lateritium with 96% similarity. Inoculating potato with the fungus showed that the fungus significantly enhanced the tolerance of potato to Phytophthora infestans, and the infection rate was 37.5%, being significantly lower than that of the experimental control (87.5%). The biomass, plant height, root biomass and taproot number of the treatment group increased by 1.25, 1.19, 2.3 and 1.47 times respectively, indicating that the fungus possessed growth promoting effect on potato. In order to explore the molecular mechanism of growth promotion and disease resistance induced by Fusarium lateritium, the expression patterns of auxin synthesis and immune defense related genes of the plant were detected. The results showed that the auxin synthesis related genes (StYUC5) were significantly up-regulated in the treatment group, and the immune related hormones jasmonic acid and salicylic acid related genes (StPI-I, StPAL and StPR1A) were also up-regulated in some degree. It is concluded that Fusarium lateritium mediates the growth promotion and disease resistance of potato by regulating the expression of plant hormone related genes. For further explore the molecular basis of Fusarium lateritium on potato growth promotion and disease resistance, the genetic transformation system was constructed and optimized, and the GFP marker strain of the fungus was obtained.

4544,"Trichoderma panacis sp. nov., an endophyte isolated from Panax notoginseng","An endophytic member of the genus Trichoderma was isolated from the root of a healthy 3-year-old Panax notoginseng in Yunnan province, PR China. The results of phylogenetic analyses based on a combined of ITS, tef1 and rpb2 indicated that this isolate was distinct from other species of the genus Trichoderma and closely related to Trichoderma songyi. It can be distinguished from T songyi by its slower growth rates on PDA and colony morphology. The novel isolate formed conidia in thick white pustules scattered mostly at the margin. Its conidiophores tended to be regularly verticillium-like, little branched, sometimes substituted by phialides singly or in whorls. Conidia are smooth, mostly broadly subglobose to ellipsoidal. In combination with the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics, all data demonstrated that the fungus studied represented a unique and distinguishable novel species of the genus Trichoderma, for which the name Trichoderma panacis sp. nov. is proposed.","Liu, SY; Yu, Y; Zhang, TY; Zhang, MY; Zhang, YX",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMATIC AND EVOLUTIONARY MICROBIOLOGY,2020,10.1099/ijsem.0.004144,0.955333900005891,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993271506582985,0.00672849341701465,0.999999999542894,4.5710557561307005e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
9334,A diverse fungal community associated with Pseudorchis albida (Orchidaceae) roots,"In addition to orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OrMF), the roots of orchids harbour plant fungal endophytes termed root-associated fungi (RAF). In the present study, the endangered photosynthetic orchid Pseudorchis albida was screened for OrMF and RAF using culture-dependent (isolations from root sections and pelotons) and culture-independent (cloning from root sections) techniques. The efficiency of the different approaches for detecting the fungi and the effect of the sampling season (summer or autumn) were evaluated. In total, 66 distinct OTUs of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal fungi were found, which, to our knowledge, is the highest diversity of RAF that has yet been detected in a single orchid species. The OrMF community was dominated by Tulasnella species, which were mainly detected by isolation from pelotons or cloning from root sections. The roots and tubers showed higher mycorrhizal colonization in summer, corroborating the frequent reports of Tulasnella from pelotons in this season. In contrast, two helotialean fungi, Varicosporium elodeae and Leohumicola sp., the latter of which was repeatedly isolated from pelotons, were significantly more abundant in the autumn.

12746,"FUNGAL ENDOPHYTES WHICH INVADE INSECT GALLS - INSECT PATHOGENS, BENIGN SAPROPHYTES, OR FUNGAL INQUILINES","Fungi are frequently found within insect galls. However, the origin of these fungi, whether they are acting as pathogens, saprophytes invading already dead galls, or fungal inquilines which invade the gall but kill the gall maker by indirect means, is rarely investigated. A pathogenic role for these fungi is usually inferred but never tested. I chose the following leaf-galling-insect/host-plant pairs (1) a cynipid which forms two-chambered galls on the veins of Oregon white oak, (2) a cynipid which forms single-chambered galls on California coast live oak, and (3) an aphid which forms galls on narrowleaf cottonwood leaves. All pairs were reported to have fungi associated with dead insects inside the gall. These fungi were cultured and identified. For the two cynipids, all fungi found inside the galls were also present in the leaves as fungal endophytes. The cottonwood leaves examined did not harbor fungal endophytes. For the cynipid on Oregon white oak, the fungal endophyte grows from the leaf into the gall and infects all gall tissue but does not directly kill the gall maker. The insect dies as a result of the gall tissue dying from fungal infection. Therefore, the fungus acts as an inquiline. Approximately 12.5% of these galls die as a result of invasion by the fungal endophyte.","WILSON, D",OECOLOGIA,1995,10.1007/BF00329088,0.984896213371494,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.499245570946591,0.500754429053409,0.998508744536161,0.00149125546383899,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

In fungi, SLPs can play either a general nutritive role, or may play specific roles in cell metabolism, or as pathogenicity or virulence factors. Results: Fifteen different genes encoding SLPs were identified in the genome of the grass endophytic fungus Epichloe festucae. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these SLPs belong to four different subtilisin families: proteinase K, kexin, pyrolysin and subtilisin. The pattern of intron loss and gain is consistent with this phylogeny. E. festucae is exceptional in that it contains two kexinlike genes. Phylogenetic analysis in Hypocreales fungi revealed an extensive history of gene loss and duplication. Conclusion: This study provides new insights into the evolution of the SLP superfamily in filamentous fungi.","Bryant, MK; Schardl, CL; Hesse, U; Scott, B",BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY,2009,10.1186/1471-2148-9-168,0.981074938025426,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.968096953584256,0.0319030464157443,0.999999999997554,2.44582132324922e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6107,Histopathology of Corn Plants Infected by Endophytic Fungi,"Simple Summary Endophytic fungi are fungi that live all or part of their life cycles within the tissues of their hosts. Although several endophyte-plant interactions are non-pathogenic in nature, it has been reported that upon infection, some endophytic fungi are able to adopt a pathogenic status resulting in disease symptoms in their host plants, ranging in severity from mild to severe. In the present study, light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to investigate the tissue colonization and cell damage of corn plants by three endophytic fungi, Fusarium verticillioides, Fusarium sacchari, and Penicillium citrinum, causing disease symptoms in the roots, stems, and leaves of infected corn plants. Tissue deterioration and cell collapse were produced by endophytic F. verticillioides, while significant cell proliferation and wall thickening were observed in corn plants infected by endophytic F. sacchari. Corn plants infected by P. citrinum showed reductions in cell diameter of the vascular bundles of infected corn tissues. The ability of endophytic fungi recovered from healthy corn plants to cause disease when inoculated in healthy tissues of other corn plants signifies their importance as determinants of corn health and productivity. Endophytic fungi inhabiting plant tissues show extensive functional diversity, ranging from mutualism to pathogenicity. The present study evaluated the histological responses of corn plants to colonization by three species of endophytic fungi isolated from corn. Corn seedlings were inoculated with 1 x 10(6) conidia per mL spore suspensions of endophytic Fusarium verticillioides, Fusarium sacchari, and Penicillium citrinum and observed for 14 days for the emergence of disease symptoms. Histological examination of diseased root, stem, and leaf tissues was conducted using light and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicated that the mean diameters of root phloem, stem vascular bundles, and leaf vascular bundles, of corn plants infected with endophytic P. citrinum (18.91 mu m, 146.96 mu m, and 107.86 mu m, respectively), F. verticillioides (18.75 mu m, 85.45 mu m, and 118.24 mu m, respectively), and F. sacchari (24.15 mu m root phloem, and 98.90 mu m stem vascular bundle diameters), were significantly lower than the root phloem (33.68 mu m), stem vascular bundle (186.77 mu m), and leaf vascular bundle (155.88 mu m) of the uninfected corn plants (p <= 0.05). Endophytic F. verticillioides was the most virulent, resulting in severe degradation and the eventual collapse of infected plant tissues. The study showed that endophytic fungi recovered from corn plants are capable of initiating significant disease responses in infected corn tissues.","Terna, TP; Nor, NMIM; Zakaria, L",BIOLOGY-BASEL,2022,10.3390/biology11050641,0.982605050723983,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.865515582520123,0.134484417479877,0.998734790999429,0.00126520900057114,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

Endophytic fungi are gaining much attention as reservoirs of bioactive compounds with beneficial therapeutic activities. The present study is focused on evaluating the chemical compositions and antimicrobial activity of secondary metabolites produced by Curvularia lunata, an endophytic fungus of Elaeis guineensis. The endophytic fungus was isolated from healthy leaves of E. guineensis using standard methods and identified using internal transcribed spacer (ITS-rDNA) sequence analysis. The fungus was subjected to solid-state fermentation and secondary metabolites extracted using ethyl acetate and concentrated under a vacuum. The crude extracts were screened for antimicrobial activity against selected pathogenic bacteria and Candida albicans using the agar diffusion method. The bioactive components of the fungal extracts were identified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Crude extract of C. lunata at 1mg/mL displayed potent antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans, with inhibition zones of 8 ± 0.6 mm, 2 ± 1.0 mm, and 10 ± 1.5 mm respectively. GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of compounds, such as 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, γ-terpinene, heptadecane, 2,6,10,14-tetramethyl, tetradecanoic acid, 2-hydroxy-, methyl ester, p-cymene, oxirane (chloromethyl) among others in the fungal extracts. These compounds are known to possess several beneficial biological properties.

5420,Assessing the Plant Growth-promoting Traits and Host Specificity of Endophytic Bacteria of Pulse Crops,"Background: Symbiotic associations between legumes and Rhizobia are ancient and fundamental. However, the plant growthpromoting endophytes other than Rhizobia are not yet fully explored for pulses productivity. The present study was aimed to isolate efficient endophytic bacteria from pulses, assess their diversity, screen their plant growth -promoting activities and to test their potential as bio inoculants for pulses. Methods: We have isolated several endophytic bacteria from pulse crops more specifically from blackgram (Vigna mungo) and greengram (Vigna radiata). After careful screening, 15 promising endophytic isolates were selected for this study. The identification of endophytic bacterial isolates was performed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The isolates were tested for their potential for the plant growth -promoting traits such as nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, indole-3-acetic acid production, siderophore secretion and antifungal activity. Pot culture experiments were conducted with the screened potential endophytic cultures. Result: The 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that species of Enterobacter, Bacillus, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Acromobacter, Ocrobacterium were found as endophytes in blackgram and greengram. The in vitro screening identified Bacillus pumilus (BG-E6), Pseudomonas fluorescens (BG-E5) and Bacillus licheniformis (BG-E3) from blackgram and Pseudomonas chlororaphis (GG-E2) and Bacillus thuringiensis (GG-E7) from greengram as potential plant growth -promoting endophytes. These strains showed antagonism against plant pathogenic fungi. Upon inoculation of these endophytic PGPR strains, the blackgram and greengram growth and yield got increased. Among the strains, BG-E6 recorded 14.7% increased yield in blackgram and GG-E2 accounted for a 19.5% yield increase in greengram compared to respective uninoculated control. The experimental results showed that there was a host specificity found among the endophytic bacterial cultures with pulses. The cross inoculation of endophytic strains did not perform well to enhance the growth and yield of their alternate hosts.","Vendan, RT; Balachandar, D",LEGUME RESEARCH,2024,10.18805/LR-4491,0.737222894221876,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997931736049459,0.0020682639505406,0.999999997816186,2.18381424055281e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

8469,Occurrence and distribution of tomato seed-borne mycoflora in Saudi Arabia and its correlation with the climatic variables,"One hundred samples of tomato seeds were collected in 2011 and 2012 from tomato-cultivated fields in Saudi Arabia and screened for their seed-borne mycoflora. A total of 30 genera and 57 species of fungi were recovered from the collected seed samples using agar plate and deep-freezing blotter methods. The two methods differed as regards the frequency of recovered seed-borne fungi. Seven fungi among those recovered from tomato seeds, which are known as plant pathogens, were tested for their pathogenicity and transmission on tomato seedlings. The recovery rate of these pathogens gradually decreased from root up to the upper stem, and did not reach to the stem apex. The distribution of tomato seed-borne fungi was also investigated throughout Saudi Arabia. In this concern, Al-Madena governorate recorded the highest incidence of fungal flora associated with tomato seeds. The impact of meteorological variables on the distribution of tomato seed-borne mycoflora was explored using the ordination technique (canonical correspondence analysis). Among all climatic factors, relative humidity was the most influential variable in this regard.

17585,Modulation of volatile organic compound formation in the Mycodiesel-producing endophyte Hypoxylon sp. CI-4.,"An endophytic Hypoxylon sp. (strain CI-4) producing a wide spectrum of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including 1,8-cineole, 1-methyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene and cyclohexane, 1,2,4-tris(methylene), was selected as a candidate for the modulation of VOC production. This was done in order to learn if the production of these and other VOCs can be affected by using agents that may modulate the epigenetics of the fungus. Many of the VOCs made by this organism are of interest because of their high energy densities and thus the potential they might have as Mycodiesel fuels. Strain CI-4 was exposed to the epigenetic modulators suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA, a histone deacetylase) and 5-azacytidine (AZA, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor). After these treatments the organism displayed striking cultural changes, including variations in pigmentation, growth rates and odour, in addition to significant differences in the bioactivities of the VOCs. The resulting variants were designated CI4-B, CI4-AZA and CI4-SAHA. GC/MS analyses of the VOCs produced by the variants showed considerable variation, with the emergence of several compounds not previously observed in the wild-type, particularly an array of tentatively identified terpenes such as α-thujene, sabinene, γ-terpinene, α-terpinolene and β-selinene, in addition to several primary and secondary alkanes, alkenes, organic acids and derivatives of benzene. Proton transfer reaction mass spectroscopic analyses showed a marked increase in the ratio of ethanol (mass 47) to the total mass of all other ionizable VOCs, from ~0.6 in the untreated strain CI-4 to ~0.8 in CI-4 grown in the presence of AZA. Strain CI4-B was created by exposure of the fungus to 100 µM SAHA; upon removal of the epigenetic modulator from the culture medium, it did not revert to the wild-type phenotype.

5250,"INTERACTIONS BETWEEN GROWTH, PHOSPHATE CONTENT AND NITROGEN-FIXATION IN MYCORRHIZAL AND NON-MYCORRHIZAL MEDICAGO-SATIVA","Nodulated M. sativa cv. Europe plants, non-mycorrhizal and mycorrhizal (inoculated with Glomus mosseae), were grown in sand or soil with a range of phosphate levels. The following parameters were measured: intensity of mycorrhizal infection, intensity of nodulation, growth, phosphate content, nitrogenase activity (acetylene reduction) and N content. Both nodulation and mycorrhizal infection had occurred within 2 wk of inoculation with the appropriate endophytes. Major increases in dry wt of mycorrhizal plants were not apparent until approximately 10 wk from inoculation. Mycorrhizal plants showed more extensive nodulation, coupled with higher rates of nitrogenase activity from 2 wk onwards, and at the final (12 wk) harvest had higher values of percent N. Phosphate content of mycorrhizal plants (.mu.g P/g dry wt) was also greater than non-mycorrhizal plants at 7 wk. By 10 or 12 wk, when significant mycorrhizal enhancement of growth was apparent, the total N and total P per mycorrhizal plant were also higher, but nitrogenase activity and phosphate content measured on a dry wt basis showed no significant differences between mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants. Apparently mycorrhizal enhancement of phosphate uptake and N fixation precedes any effect on growth. The importance of the time factor in the development of this tripartite symbiosis between legume, Rhizobium and mycorrhizal fungus is indicated.","SMITH, SE; DAFT, MJ",AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY,1977,10.1071/PP9770403,0.800942892897568,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.959954324433171,0.0400456755668291,0.999993790318889,6.20968111064713e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18456,The Overproduction of Indole-3-Acetic Acid (IAA) in Endophytes Upregulates Nitrogen Fixation in Both Bacterial Cultures and Inoculated Rice Plants.,"Endophytic bacteria from roots and leaves of rice plants were isolated and identified in order to select the diazotrophs and improve their nitrogen-fixing abilities. The nitrogen-fixing endophytes were identified by PCR amplification of the nifH gene fragment. For this purpose, two isolates, Enterobacter cloacae RCA25 and Klebsiella variicola RCA26, and two model bacteria (Herbaspirillum seropedicae z67 and Sinorhizobium fredii NGR234) were transformed to increase the biosynthesis of the main plant auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). A significant increase in the production of IAA was observed for all strains. When the expression of nifH gene and the activity of the nitrogenase enzyme were analyzed in liquid cultures, we found that they were positively affected in the IAA-overproducing endophytes as compared to the wild-type ones. Rice plants inoculated with these modified strains showed a significant upregulation of the nitrogenase activity when plants infected with the wild-type strains were used as reference. Similar results were obtained too with common bean plants infected with the S. fredii NGR234 strain. These findings suggest that IAA overproduction improves nitrogen-fixing apparatus of endophytic bacteria both in liquid cultures and in inoculated host plants.

9104,Tomato growth promotion by the fungal endophytes Serendipita indica and Serendipita herbamans is associated with sucrose de-novo synthesis in roots and differential local and systemic effects on carbohydrate metabolisms and gene expression,"Plant growth-promoting and stress resilience-inducing root endophytic fungi represent an additional carbohy-drate sink. This study aims to test if such root endophytes affect the sugar metabolism of the host plant to divert the flow of resources for their purposes. Fresh and dry weights of roots and shoots of tomato (Solanum lyco-persicum) colonised by the closely related Serendipita indica and Serendipita herbamans were recorded. Plant carbohydrate metabolism was analysed by measuring sugar levels, by determining activity signatures of key enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, and by quantifying mRNA levels of genes involved in sugar transport and turnover. During the interaction with the tomato plants, both fungi promoted root growth and shifted shoot biomass from stem to leaf tissues, resulting in increased leaf size. A common effect induced by both fungi was the inhibition of phosphofructokinase (PFK) in roots and leaves. This glycolytic-pacing enzyme shows how the glycolysis rate is reduced in plants and, eventually, how sugars are allocated to different tissues. Sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activity was strongly induced in colonised roots. This was accompanied by increased SPS-A1 gene expression in S. herbamans-colonised roots and by increased sucrose amounts in roots colonised by S. indica. Other enzyme activities were barely affected by S. indica, but mainly induced in leaves of S. herbamans- colonised plants and decreased in roots. This study suggests that two closely related root endophytic fungi differentially influence plant carbohydrate metabolism locally and systemically, but both induce a similar in-crease in plant biomass. Notably, both fungal endophytes induce an increase in SPS activity and, in the case of S. indica, sucrose resynthesis in roots. In leaves of S. indica-colonised plants, SWEET11b expression was enhanced, thus we assume that excess sucrose was exported by this transporter to the roots.","De Rocchis, V; Jammer, A; Camehl, I; Franken, P; Roitsch, T",JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY,2022,10.1016/j.jplph.2022.153755,0.959495664022372,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992331770050513,0.00766822994948669,0.999999999999081,9.18931597482242e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19602,Plant endophytic bacteria: A potential resource pool of electroactive micro-organisms.,"Electroactive micro-organisms play a significant role in microbial fuel cells. It is necessary to discover potential resources in plant endophytes. In this study, plant tissues were selected to isolate endophytic bacteria, and the electrochemical activity potential was evaluated. The microbial fuel cell (MFC) is used to evaluate the electricity-producing activity of endophytic bacteria in plant tissues, and the species distribution of micro-organisms in the anode of the MFC after inoculation of plant tissues is determined by high-throughput sequencing. Twenty-six strains of bacteria were isolated from plant tissues belonging to Angelica and Sweet Potato, of which 17 strains from six genera had electrochemical activity, including Bacillus sp., Pleomorphomonas sp., Rahnella sp., Shinella sp., Paenibacillus sp. and Staphylococcus sp. Moreover, the electricity-producing micro-organisms in the plant tissue are enriched. Pseudomonas and Clostridioides are the dominant genera of MFC anode inoculated with angelica tissue. Staphylococcus and Lachnoclostridium are the dominant genera in MFC anode inoculated with sweet potato tissue. And the most representative Gram-positive strain Staphylococcus succinus subsp. succinus H6 and plant tissue were further analysed for electrochemical activity. And a strain numbered H6 and plant tissue had a good electrogenerating activity. This study is of great significance for expanding the resource pool of electricity-producing micro-organisms and tapping the potential of plant endophytes for electricity-producing. This is the first study to apply plant endophytes to MFC to explore the characteristics of electricity production. It is of great significance for exploring the diversity of plant endophytes and the relationship between electricity producing bacteria and plants.",Ling L; Yang C; Li Z; Luo H; Feng S; Zhao Y; Lu L,Journal of applied microbiology,2022,10.1111/jam.15368,0.620482780868807,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Absence,Absence,0.241984196442001,0.758015803557999,0.884361080990905,0.115638919009095,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Absence,Uncertain_Relevance
744,Fungal endophyte symbiosis and plant diversity in successional fields,"Increasing evidence suggests that microbial interactions are important determinants of plant biodiversity. The hypothesis that fungal endophyte symbiosis reduces diversity in successional fields was tested by manipulating infection of tall fescue, the most abundant perennial grass in the eastern United States. Over a 4-year period. species richness declined and tall fescue dominance increased in infected plots relative to uninfected plots without differences in total productivity. A host-specific endophyte, with negligible biomass, altered plant community structure in this Long-term field experiment and may be reducing plant diversity throughout its expanding range.","Clay, K; Holah, J",SCIENCE,1999,10.1126/science.285.5434.1742,0.844075813716611,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999414645369837,5.8535463016336e-4,0.999999999998144,1.85573778566095e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6727,Bioactive Properties of the Aqueous Extracts of Endophytic Fungi Associated with Scots Pine (Pinus sylvestris) Roots,"Despite the continuing interest in various plant and natural products, only a small portion of the biologically active compounds from nature has been discovered and exploited. In this study, antioxidant and antibacterial properties of aqueous fractions of three endophytic fungi isolated from the roots of 8-year-old Scots pines (Pinus sylvestris) growing on a drained peatland were investigated. The endophytic fungi species were Acephala applanata, Phialocephala fortinii, and Humicolopsis cephalosporioides/Coniochaeta mutabilis. The bioactivities were examined using hydrogen peroxide scavenging and oxygen radical absorbance capacity tests as well as sensitive Escherichia coli-based biosensors, which produce a luminescent signal in the presence of substances with oxidative or genotoxic properties. In addition, cell models for Parkinson's disease, age-related macular degeneration, and osteoarthritis were used to evaluate the potential for pharmaceutical applications. The aqueous extracts of fungi and 19 out of 42 fractions were found to be active in one or more of the tests used. However, no activity was found in the age-related macular degeneration and osteoarthritis cell model tests. Additionally, bioactivity data was connected with metabolites putatively annotated, and out of 330 metabolites, 177 were interesting in view of the bioactivities investigated. A majority of these were peptides and all three fungal species shared a highly similar metabolome. We propose that Scots pine endophytic fungi are a rich source of interesting metabolites, and synergistic effects may cause the bioactivities, as they were found to vary after the fractionation process.","Tienaho, J; Karonen, M; Muilu-Mäkelä, R; Kaseva, J; de Pedro, N; Vicente, F; Genilloud, O; Aapola, U; Uusitalo, H; Vuolteenaho, K; Franzén, R; Wähälä, K; Karp, M; Santala, V; Sarjala, T",PLANTA MEDICA,2020,10.1055/a-1185-4437,0.556397175027337,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.988810854753516,0.0111891452464844,0.999999999994424,5.5764282080872395e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
20652,Identification of endophytic fungi of medicinal herbs of Lauraceae and Rutaceae with antimicrobial property,"This study was conducted to determine taxonomical features and antimicrobial activities of 156 isolates of endophytic fungi collected from twigs of medicinal plants of Lauraceae (67 isolates) and Rutaceae (89 isolates) in central and northern Taiwan. The 156 isolates of fungi were classified into 35 genera in 19 families based on morphological characteristics of mycelia and asexual/sexual spores, as well as molecular phylogenetic analysis of rDNA LSU D1/D2 and ITS regions. The most common endophytes were in the taxa of Colletotrichum, Guignardia, Hypoxylon, Nigrospora, Phomopsis and Xylaria, and the most common hosts were Citrus and Zanthoxylum of Rutaceae and Cinnamomum of Lauraceae. Molecular phylogenetic analysis showed that xylariaceous isolates could be separated into Xylaria and Hypoxylon groups based on rDNA of LSU D1/D2 and ITS regions. Four isolates of endophytic fungi including Lasmenia sp. isolate CB10, Ophioceras tenuisporum isolate CI02, Xylaria cubensis isolate LA04 and Cyanodermella sp. isolate TR09 were tested for antimicrobial activities using a dual culture method and Lasmenia sp. isolate CB10 and Cyanodermella sp. isolate TR09 showed better antimicrobial activity against 12 plant pathogens including 9 fungi and 3 bacteria.

To provide information for the risk assessment of potato, citrus, and Dendrobium officinale, field experiments combined with QuEChERS and HPLC-MS/MS were performed to detect picoxystrobin. Picoxystrobin had good linearity (R2 > 0.99), the average recovery rate was 75 − 102%, and the relative standard deviation was 1 − 11%. Picoxystrobin was utilized as the test agent in field experiments, and samples were evaluated and analyzed at various times after the final application utilizing random sampling. The results showed that picoxystrobin residuals in potato and citrus (orange meat) were ˂ 0.01 mg kg−1, whereas those in citrus whole fruit, D. officinale (fresh), and D. officinale (dried) were < 0.05 − 0.084, 0.16 − 3.82, and 0.34 − 9.05 mg kg−1, respectively. Based on these results, both the acute risk quotient (2.77%) and chronic risk quotient (8.7%) were ˂100%, and the dietary risk assessment indicated that the intake of picoxystrobin residues in potato, citrus fruit, and D. officinale did not pose a health risk.

Methods and Results: After strict sample sterilization, an endophytic fungus BH-3 with great antibacterial activity against Leuconostoc mesenteroides was isolated from the bulbs of L. lancifolium and was identified as Fusarium oxysporum on the basis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA sequence and morphological traits. After partial purification including superfiltration and gel filtration, the major antibacterial fractions were found to be the substances with the molecular mass ranging from 35 to 60 kDa, mainly 55 kDa. The partially purified antibacterial fractions were stable at thermal processes, with more than 80% of activity left at 60 degrees C for 1 h, and even 70.75% left at 121 degrees C for 15 min. 90.33-98.97% of activity was observed in the pH range of 4.0-7.0. But the fractions were sensitive to different proteases. Conclusions: Endophytic strain F. oxysporum BH-3 isolated from the bulbs of L. lancifolium produced protein-like antibacterial metabolites. The antibacterial assay against Leuc. mesenteroides indicated that the fractions were stable at thermal processes and wide pH conditions, but sensitive to proteolyses.

16254,Community structure of endophytic fungi in asymptomatic and symptomatic Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica infected by diplodia tip blight; [受枯梢病侵染的有症状和无症状樟子松的内生真菌群落结构],"[Objective] Diplodia tip blight of Mongolian pine is widely distributed in Honghuaerji, Inner Mongolia of northern China, causing severe damage on natural Mongolian pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica). Our study analyzed the diversity and community structure of endophytic fungi in different parts of asymptomatic and symptomatic Mongolian pine infected by Diplodia sapinea, laying a research foundation for the subsequent screening of effective endophytic antagonistic strains and the control of diplodia tip blight. [Method] Using culture-based and high-throughput sequencing techniques, the diversity and structure of endophytic fungal communities in different tissues (needles, twigs and phloem) of asymptomatic and symptomatic Mongolian pine were compared and analyzed, and endophytic fungi with significant differences in abundance at twigs were screened. [Result] (1) 360 and 233 taxa of endophytic fungi were isolated from symptomatic and asymptomatic Mongolian pine, respectively. D. sapinea was isolated from both asymptomatic and symptomatic Mongolian pine, with the highest isolation rate. In addition, Hormonema sp. had a higher isolation rate on asymptomatic Mongolian pine, but a lower isolation rate on symptomatic Mongolian pine, and it was only isolated from the diseased twigs. (2) The amplicon sequencing results showed that there were no significant differences of α diversity of endophytic fungi between symptomatic and asymptomatic Mongolian pine, but beta diversity, community composition and structure of endophytic fungi were various according to different tissues from symptomatic and asymptomatic Mongolian pine. (3) Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis of amplicon revealed that the fungus Diplodia sp. was significantly enriched in the twigs of symptomatic Mongolian pine, while Hormonema sp. was significantly enriched in the twigs of asymptomatic Mongolian pine. (4) Fungal trophic classification confirmed that the relative abundance of saprophytic fungi was highest in all three parts of asymptomatic Mongolian pine, while the relative abundance of plant pathogens in the phloem of symptomatic Mongolian pine was significantly increased. [Conclusion] There are no significant differences in the diversity of endophytic fungi between symptomatic and asymptomatic Mongolian pine, but there are significant differences in the community structure of endophytic fungi in different tissues.

18239,Glucose Homeostasis Is Important for Immune Cell Viability during Candida Challenge and Host Survival of Systemic Fungal Infection.,"To fight infections, macrophages undergo a metabolic shift whereby increased glycolysis fuels antimicrobial inflammation and killing of pathogens. Here we demonstrate that the pathogen Candida albicans turns this metabolic reprogramming into an Achilles' heel for macrophages. During Candida-macrophage interactions intertwined metabolic shifts occur, with concomitant upregulation of glycolysis in both host and pathogen setting up glucose competition. Candida thrives on multiple carbon sources, but infected macrophages are metabolically trapped in glycolysis and depend on glucose for viability: Candida exploits this limitation by depleting glucose, triggering rapid macrophage death. Using pharmacological or genetic means to modulate glucose metabolism of host and/or pathogen, we show that Candida infection perturbs host glucose homeostasis in the murine candidemia model and demonstrate that glucose supplementation improves host outcomes. Our results support the importance of maintaining glucose homeostasis for immune cell survival during Candida challenge and for host survival in systemic infection.",Tucey TM; Verma J; Harrison PF; Snelgrove SL; Lo TL; Scherer AK; Barugahare AA; Powell DR; Wheeler RT; Hickey MJ; Beilharz TH; Naderer T; Traven A,Cell metabolism,2018,10.1016/j.cmet.2018.03.019,0.94795507258893,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.977528105789205,0.0224718942107952,0.999998313538368,1.68646163156705e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16018,Insight into the diversity and application characters of endophytes in ramie (Boehmeria nivea L. Gaud),"Endophytes are essential for plant growth and resistance to stress. However, little is known about endophytes of ramie, which is an important fiber crop. Here, to gain insight into ramie endophytes, we collected 180 samples of three varieties ramie across four microhabitats (rhizosphere, root, stem, and leaf) in three geographic locations, and further endophyte Pseudomonas sp. B4 was isolated and its function was analyzed. The results demonstrated that microhabitat was the primary for ramie bacterial assemblage rather than geographic location or ramie variety. For endophytes, Cyanobacteria was the main phylum (>75 %, in the roots, stems, and leaves); Proteobacteria was the secondary phylum, and with relative abundance of 9.08 %, 14.97 % and 16.28 % in the roots, stems and leaves, respectively. The results of LEfSe analysis indicated Sphingomonas and Acidothermus were the biomarkers in the rhizosphere, Clostridia was the biomarker in the roots, and unidentified Chloroplast and Ralstonia were biomarkers in the stems and leaves, respectively. From the rhizosphere to the leaves, the co-occurrence network complexity gradually decreased, and the co-occurrence network of the leaves was the simplest. Proteobacteria was the key taxa according to the co‑occurrence networks analysis results. In addition, Pseudomonas sp. B4, which belongs to γ-Proteobacteria, was isolated from ramie plants and could increase plant height (19.92 %), stem diameter (10.39 %) and fiber yield (21.67 %) remarkably. Overall, this study elucidated the composition and potential functions of ramie endophytes. And, the endophyte B4 improved ramie growth and fiber yield.

2027,Phytohormone-producing fungal endophytes and hardwood-derived biochar interact to ameliorate heavy metal stress in soybeans,"This study identifies the potential use of the combined application of hardwood-derived biochar (BC) and phytohormone-producing endophytes for enhancing crop production under heavy metal stress. For this purpose, the endophyte Galactomyces geotrichum WLL1 was isolated from Trapa japonica inhabiting a Korean river whose rainfall catchment area included an abandoned zinc mine. Pyrolyzed BC derived from pine hardwoods was obtained commercially. Under growth chamber conditions, the combined or individual application of G. geotrichum WLL1 and BC (15 % w/w) significantly improved soybean growth with or without excess Zn (5,253.6 mg kg(-1)). The beneficial effect of treatments was observed in the low uptake of Zn by different plant tissues and its immobilization in the soil. Biochar and G. geotrichum WLL1 shared their beneficial properties synergistically and improved plant growth characteristics with or without Zn heavy metal stress (HMS). Further, intensive root colonization of G. geotrichum WLL1 in the presence of BC was observed irrespective of HMS. Most interestingly, BC and G. geotrichum WLL1 had a priming effect by inducing systemic resistance in soybeans as revealed by significantly large amounts of jasmonic acid. These properties of BC could be exploited under abiotic and biotic stress. Here, for the first time, the combined application of hardwood-derived BC and phytohormone-producing endophytes is recommended for environmentally friendly and cost-effective crop production under HMS.","Waqas, M; Khan, AL; Kang, SM; Kim, YH; Lee, IJ",BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS,2014,10.1007/s00374-014-0937-4,0.94843526067837,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999476866591514,5.2313340848628e-4,0.999999999795789,2.04210981458175e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3156,Community-based biotic effects as determinants of tree resistance to pests and pathogens,"In the light of the global increase in forest pests and diseases, accompanied by withdrawal of chemical pesticides and fungicides, we review recent advances in how forest tree resistance to pests and diseases might be influenced by manipulation of characteristics of the trees' community of associated plants and other organisms. These include associational resistance (AR), effected by manipulation of tree species composition or richness, genotypic diversity, or by tree density/frequency of resistant species or genotypes, use of hybrids, and strategic use of bacterial and fungal symbionts to engender systemic induced resistance, or defense priming. Due to the rotation times in forest production systems, none of the community-based actions that attempt to disrupt a tree-pest or tree-pathogen interaction, can be used in a rapidly mobilised targeted response to currently known pests or pathogens or to unknown ones that are yet to emerge. The only exception is the possible use of non-pathogenic or mutualistic organisms to induce systemic resistance or prime tree defence systems against attack. Due to the range of permutations of participating species and assemblages and the idiosyncratic nature of their ecological interactions and processes, it is not currently possible to formulate predictive rules to protect forests using only these community -based methods. It is however possible to use them as part of a long-term prophylactic strategy by structuring future forests to increase their general resistance, and reduce the probability of impacts of pests and diseases, e.g. via diversification of tree species and genotypes.","Iason, GR; Taylor, J; Helfer, S",FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,2018,10.1016/j.foreco.2018.01.037,0.992888308647014,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999486333592498,5.1366640750243e-4,0.999999997833066,2.1669338545748904e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

4460,"Fusarium antagonism potential and metabolomics analysis of endophytic bacteria isolated from Crotalaria retusa L., a traditional medicinal plant in Côte d'Ivoire","Sixty-four endophytic bacteria were isolated from roots, stems, and leaves of Crotalaria retusa L., a medicinal plant well-known for its antimicrobial properties in C & ocirc;te d'Ivoire. Taxonomic characterization revealed that these bacteria were mainly dominated by the genera Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, Bacillus, and Inquilinus. The antagonistic activities of the endophytic bacteria against two phytopathogenic fungi affiliated with the genus Fusarium were tested using in vitro coculture. Isolates belonging to the genus Inquilinus showed the highest inhibitory activities against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, ranging from 40% to 57%, while the highest inhibitory activities against Fusarium graminearum were obtained with Bacillus isolates (similar to 66%). Finally, a metabolomic study of the leaves, stems, and seeds of the plant and of the endophytes presenting antifungal activity was carried out using LC-MS/MS analysis of the methanolic extracts of all active endophytic isolates. The identified metabolites of interest from the endophytes were mainly peptides, lipids, and steroids. Two pyrrolizidine alkaloids, monocrotaline and senecionine, were detected in the plant organs but not in the endophytic bacterial extracts. These results highlighted the potential of C. retusa L. plant and its endophytic microbiome as a source of bioactive molecules of interest and biocontrol agents against phytopathogenic Fusarium spp. Bacterial endophytes were isolated from Crotalaria retusa and identified. Nine bacteria were potentially antagonistic against Fusarium wilt causing fungi. The metabolome of these bacteria was characterized using LC-MS/MS analysis.","Ahoty, ESS; Fossou, RK; Magot, F; Ebou, ATE; Kouadjo-Zézé, CGZ; Marchesseau, B; Spina, R; Grosjean, J; Laurain-Mattar, D; Slezack, S; Zézé, A",FEMS MICROBIOLOGY LETTERS,2025,10.1093/femsle/fnaf056,0.983607699928908,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.977419193784579,0.0225808062154206,0.999999944717527,5.52824727106938e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15906,Community Structure and Niche Differentiation of Endophytic Microbiome in Populus alba×P. berolinensis under Different Ecological Environment; [不同生态环境下银中杨内生菌群落结构及生态位变异],"Objective: This paper aims at studying the diversity of endosphere bacterial and fungal microbiome in roots and stems of Populus alba × P. berolinensis grown in three different sites, and the results would provide scientific basis for the study of interactions between plants and microorganisms. Method: The roots and stems of poplar were collected from three different sites: Changweizi village of Linyuan town in Daqing city, Cuohai farm in Qiqihar city and Hancunhe Dongying nursery in Fangshan District. After surface disinfection, microbial DNA was extracted and sequenced by Illumina MiSeq using 16 s rRNA and internal transcribed spacer amplicon (ITS) amplifiers to determine the bacterial and fungal communities associated with the different plant habitats and niches. Results: According to the 97% sequence similarity cut-off level, the reads of bacteria and fungi were clustered into 1541 and 240 OTU, respectively. In comparison with the database, we found that Actinobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidia were the dominant endophytic bacteria, and the fungal community was dominated by Dothideomycetes, Agaricomycetes, Sordariomycetes and Tremellomycetes. The results of alpha and beta diversity showed that the stem endophytic communities of poplar in Beijing, Daqing and Qiqihar were obviously clustered and could not be distinguished. However, the endophytic community of roots was dependent on plant organs and growth environment. The Mantel test results showed that pH, and soil organic matter (SOM) contents and potassium (K) content were significantly correlated with the microbial communities (P< 0.05). However, the nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content did not appear to be important factors explaining the variance in the communities of poplar root endophytes. We identified the core microbiome in the different organs of poplar grown in different environmental conditions, and obtained a total of 23 core bacteria OTU belonging to 6 classes, and 22 core fungi OTU belonging to 7 classes, respectively. Species indicator analysis revealed seven root endophytic bacterial indicator OTUs: Actinophytocola, Actinoplanes, Pseudonocardia, Rhodomicrobium, Streptomyces, Variovorax and Bradyrhizobium; five stem endophytic bacterial indicator OTUs: Bifidobacterium, Dialister, Faecalibacterium, Micrococcus and Rhodococcus; two root endophytic fungal indicator OTUs: Leptosphaeria and Ilyonectria; three stem endophytic fungal indicator OTUs: Pleosporales, Alternaria and Endosporium. The UpSetR results showed that 51 (3.30%) OTUs of bacteria were shared by 6 groups, and the unique OTU of 6 groups accounted for 4.54-15.44%; one (0.42%) OTU of fungi was shared by 6 groups, and the unique OTU of 6 groups accounted for 2.92-29.17%. Conclusion: The bacterial and fungal community structure depends on the pH, the soil organic matter content and potassium (K) content. Each plant organ represents a unique ecological niche for the endophytic communities. Finally, we have identified the indicator operational taxonomic units (OTU) and core microbiome associated with the different ecological niches of Populus and different environmental conditions. The results provide a basis for further study of host-microbial interactions with the identified abundant OTU of Populus. © 2020, Editorial Department of Scientia Silvae Sinicae.

15967,Optimization of process parameters for high yield production of exo – inulinase from trichoderma asperellum rsbr08 by using solid state fermentation,"Inulinase is an industrially applicable enzyme which is used widely in the production of ultra high fructose syrups and fructo-oligosaccharides. Production of inulinase enzyme in a cost effective manner is the major challenge faced. In the present research study, Trichoderma asperellum RSBR08 which has the capability to produce high exo-inulinase enzyme is produced by using the solid state fermentation. Process parameters for production of exo-inulinase by using solid state fermentation were optimized. Results showed high exo-inulinase production in garlic as substrate (199.2±6.3 U/gds), 45% moisture percentage (228.4±3.4), 26oC temperature (219.1±5.8) and 5.0 pH (213.6±4.5). Effect of different metals viz. Mg2+,Zn2+, K+,Ca2+, Na+,Mn2+ and Hg2+ were studied on the production of exo-inulinase enzyme in which Ca2+ induced the enzyme production (196.3±5.6) whereas Hg2+ has inhibited the inulinase production (37.0±3.3). Based on the above results, the solid substrate fermentation parameters optimized can be used industrially. © 2020, Association of Biotechnology and Pharmacy.

6504,"Integrated control of powdery mildew on field-grown mango trees by foliar sprays of mono-potassium phosphate fertilizer, sterol inhibitor fungicides and the strobilurin Kresoxym-methyl","Foliar sprays of solutions of di-potassium hydrogen orthophosphate, K2HPO4 (DKP) and potassium di-hydrogen orthophosphate, KH2PO4 (MKP), commercial systemic fungicides, and an alternating treatment with phosphate fertilizer and systemic fungicides inhibited development of the powdery mildew fungus, Oidium mangiferae, on flowers and bloom clusters of field-grown mango trees. The effectiveness of the alternation treatments with an appropriate systemic fungicide and 1% solution of mono-potassium phosphate (MKP) in controlling powdery mildew on bloom clusters was similar to that of the commercial treatment with the systemic fungicides. However, application of the systemic fungicides alone, on the same dates on which they were applied in the alternation treatment, without application of the phosphate treatment was significantly less effective in controlling the disease than either the phosphate or the alternation treatment. This indicates that the use of phosphate fertilizer has a significant role in disease control and that it can reduce the number of fungicide treatments necessary against powdery mildew by up to 50%. These results were confirmed in large-scale demonstration trials conducted in commercial orchards in 1994 and 1995. Our 1997 findings also revealed that tank-mix treatments of 1% MKP solution with half the recommended quantity of sterol inhibitor fungicide applied at 14-day intervals provided a protection against powdery mildew comparable with or superior to that given by the standard fungicides-based treatment applied at 7-day intervals. Tank-mix treatments of MKP (1%) with sterol inhibitor at the recommended rate or with the new strobilurin Kresoxym-methyl (BAS 490F, strobi), or the BAS 490F alone, were the most effective, and provided >95% protection against O, mangiferae, compared with the control. Phosphate solutions were found not to be phytotoxic to plant tissue. These treatments affected the yield of mango trees: a significantly lower yield was observed on control untreated trees, probably because of powdery mildew infection on flowers. The inhibitory effectiveness of phosphate salts makes them a potential major component of an integrated pest management program.","Reuveni, M; Harpaz, M; Reuveni, R",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY,1998,10.1023/A:1008624106269,0.99011358471133,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999832336086392,1.6766391360809e-4,0.999999993947043,6.052956580404611e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

F. Muell. (Epacridaceae) plants collected from a field site in New South Wales, Australia. All isolates formed typical ericoid mycorrhizal structures when inoculated onto roots of Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait. (Ericaceae). Microsatellite-primed PCR fingerprints generated using the primers (GTG)(5) and (GACA)(4) indicated that considerable genetic diversity exists within the endophyte population. It was estimated that a minimum of 43 genetically distinct mycelial genets were present in the root systems of the sampled W. pungens population, with most genets confined to individual plants. Two genets, however, were present within the root systems of two adjacent plants. While most genets were represented by less than eight isolates, three genets contained up to 41 isolates, suggesting that root system colonization by some endophytic mycelia might be extensive.","Liu, G; Chambers, SM; Cairney, JWG",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,1998,10.1046/j.1469-8137.1998.00256.x,0.988527609174068,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99970433492796,2.9566507203984e-4,0.999999992352617,7.647383060138681e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

11562,"Development of multiplex PCR protocols for simultaneous detection of Alternaria padwickii, Bipolaris oryzae, Pyricularia oryzae and Ustilaginoidea virens in rice seed","Rice, a staple crop sustaining over half of the global population, is widely cultivated and traded as crop as well as exchanged globally in the form of germplasm. This crop is particularly susceptible to seed-borne fungal pathogens such as Alternaria padwickii, Bipolaris oryzae, Pyricularia oryzae and Ustilaginoidea virens, which pose significant threats to seed health, conservation, and transboundary movement. To address these risks, we developed robust two multiplex PCR protocols capable of simultaneously detecting A. padwickii, B. oryzae and P. oryzae and A. padwickii, P. oryzae and U. virens using specific primer sets: ApEF-1F&1R designed from translation elongation factor 1 (EF 1) region of A. padwickii, BoSP7-F&R designed from ATCC 44560 unplaced genomic scaffold_136 of B. oryzae, PoM-1F&1R designed from hydrophobin-like protein (MPG1) gene region of P. oryzae and UvP-1F&1R designed from internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of U. virens. These primers amplified distinct target sequences of 175, 325, 520, and 240 bp, respectively, with an optimal annealing temperature of 62 degrees C. Sensitivity test revealed that the primers detect only target pathogens at concentration of DNA as low as 0.1 ng mu l- 1 of each pathogen, demonstrating high specificity. These findings aim to provide a robust tool for ensuring seed health testing, potentially improving disease management, reducing post-harvest losses, and supporting disease-free long-term conservation, seed certification, and expediting quick quarantine processing of rice seed.","Kumar, P; Akhtar, J; Meena, BR; Kiran, R; Tiwari, R; Chalam, VC",PHYSIOLOGICAL AND MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY,2025,10.1016/j.pmpp.2025.102786,0.986383625003185,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993102436344086,0.00689756365591411,0.999999951760903,4.82390966061175e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2271,Specific and sensitive PCR detection of Cadophora luteo-olivacea associated with grapevine trunk diseases,"Grapevine trunk diseases, caused by different fungal pathogens, are the most relevant group of diseases that affect vineyards, causing important economic losses. Quality control for sanitary purposes should be applied for different diseases in every stages of the plant development, from the nursery during propagation to the vineyard during grape production. Petri disease has been identified as one of the most dangerous for vine plants causing economic losses in cellars worldwide. Petri disease is caused by the infection of different fungal pathogens, mainly, Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, Phaeocremonium minimum and Cadophora hiteo-olivacea. The molecular detection of plant pathogens is topical due to its facility, reproducibility and accuracy. Here we have described a PCR protocol based in a pair of new designed specific primers for the rapid detection of C. hiteo-olivacea. The described procedure is intended for the direct inspection of plants suspected of being infected. Bovine serum albumin and MgCl2 were used as PCR adjuvants in order to cope with the presence of polymerase inhibitors from wood samples. Several assays have been settled out in order to assign the sensitivity and specificity of the developed technique. Under the conditions tested, the procedure has a low detection limit (10 pg) and it is specific for C. hiteo-olivacea detection among other Cadophora species and fungal endophytes of Vitis vinifera.","Vicente, J; Alonso, A; Navascués, E; Marquina, D; Santos, A",CROP PROTECTION,2020,10.1016/j.cropro.2020.105140,0.934051566836519,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999422796225797,5.7720377420259e-4,0.999999950119861,4.98801394632764e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16705,Identification of the Fungal Endophyte Epichloe festucae in the Fine Fescue Festuca ampla.,"Festuca ampla is native to the Iberian Peninsula (4). Endophytic mycelium was observed by microscopy (2) in stem pith samples of two of eight asymptomatic plants of F. ampla collected in one population from a natural grassland in Salamanca, Spain. The fungus could be isolated (2) only from these two plants, and conidiophores and reniform conidia typical of Epichloe species (3) were observed in pure cultures. The two infected plants maintained in pots outside, developed ectostromata in some reproductive stems (choke disease) the year after the field sampling. Six seeds collected from an infected plant were germinated, and all six seedlings were found to be infected based on microscopy (2), implying seed transmission of the endophyte. These observations suggest that this is a pleiotropic symbiont, having both mutualistic and pathogenic states in its host. An ergovaline concentration of 120 ng/g dry weight was detected in a sample of leaves and leaf sheaths of an infected plant. All of the above characteristics are typical of the genus Epichloe, and in particular of the fine fescue endophyte E. festucae (1,3). To determine the species, internal transcribed spacer and 5.8-rDNA sequences as well as a partial sequence of the β-tubulin gene were obtained. These two sequences (EMBL Accession Nos. AJ488497 and AJ488498) showed 100% sequence homology to the corresponding sequences in E. festucae. To our knowledge, this is the first report of this endophyte species in the grass F. ampla.

15623,Diversity and Anti-Dermatophyte Activities of Endophytic Fungi from Datura metel,"Objective： To investigate the taxonomic structure and diversity of endophytic fungi from Datura metel and screen the strains with anti-dermatophyte activities，so as to provide resources for the development of new lead compounds against dermatomycosis. Method： Endophytic fungi were isolated from the roots，stems and leaves of D. metel after tissue block incubation and then identified by morphological analysis and rDNA-internal transcribed spacer（ITS）sequencing. Their anti-dermatophyte activities were detected by agar diffusion assay. Result： A total of 292 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated from D. metel， belonging to 34 genera，with Fusarium（72.97%）in roots，Fusarium（37.25%）and Plectosphaerella（28.43%） in stems，and Colletotrichum（39.66%）in leaves as the dominant species. The isolation rate（89.23%）， colonization rate（84.62%），and diversity index（1.82）of endophytic fungi in leaves were significantly higher than those in roots（70.48%，70.48% and 1.23）and stems（69.39%，68.03% and 1.64）. The determination of anti-dermatophyte activities of 35 endophytic fungal fermented filtrates showed that the strains exhibiting inhibitory activities against Microsporum canis，Trichosporon mucoides，Trichophyton rubrum and Candida albicans accounted for 97.14%， 71.43%，45.71%， and 25.71%， respectively.

15161,Exploring the mechanisms of endophytic bacteria for suppressing early blight disease in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.),"Controlling early blight of tomatoes using endophytic bacteria is an eco-friendly and sustainable approach to manage this common fungal disease caused by Alternaria solani, Alternaria alternata, and Curvularia lunata. Endophytic bacteria are microorganisms that live inside plant tissues without causing harm and can help protect the host plant from pathogens. In this work, twenty endophytic bacterial isolates from tomato healthy plants were tested against pathogenic fungal isolates that caused early blight disease in vitro. Out of the 20 tested isolates, three (B4, B7, and B17) were considered effective isolates against the growth of fungal pathogens. The three isolates were recognized as Enterobacter cloacae HS-6 (B4), Pseudomonas gessardii HS-5 (B 7), and Pseudomonas mediterranea HS-4 (B17) using 16s-rDNA sequencing. Different concentrations of bacterial cultural diltrates at 20, 40, and 60% were tested for their antagonistic effects on the development of pathogenic fungi in vitro. The lowest dry weights of pathogenic isolates in all bacterial culture filtrates were discovered at 60%. In all culture filtrates, phenolic compounds showed the largest peak area. Under greenhouse conditions, the least disease severity of tomato early blight was found for E. cloacae and its culture filtrate compared to other treatments. Real-time PCR was used to examine the expression pattern of the defense response gene β-1.3 glucanase gene in infected tomato plants with pathogenic fungi (control) as well as its relations with efficient biocontrol agent (E. cloacae). The expression of the gene increased substantially and significantly after three days from the inoculation-infected plants with C. lunata and E. cloacae while it reached the maximum after five days from the inoculation with A. alternata, A. solani and E. cloacae. Our study concluded that the endophytic bacterial isolate E. cloacae can be considered a promising biocontrol agent for preventing tomato early blight.

14771,"Fungal endophytes of alpinia officinarum rhizomes: Insights on diversity and variation across growth years, growth sites, and the inner active chemical concentration","In the present study, the terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) technique, combined with the use of a clone library, was applied to assess the baseline diversity of fungal endophyte communities associated with rhizomes of Alpinia officinarum Hance, a medicinal plant with a long history of use. A total of 46 distinct T-RFLP fragment peaks were detected using HhaI or MspI mono-digestiontargeted, amplified fungal rDNA ITS sequences from A. officinarum rhizomes. Cloning and sequencing of representative sequences resulted in the detection of members of 10 fungal genera: Pestalotiopsis, Sebacina, Penicillium, Marasmius, Fusarium, Exserohilum, Mycoleptodiscus, Colletotrichum, Meyerozyma, and Scopulariopsis. The T-RFLP profiles revealed an influence of growth year of the host plant on fungal endophyte communities in rhizomes of this plant species; whereas, the geographic location where A. officinarum was grown contributed to only limited variation in the fungal endophyte communities of the host tissue. Furthermore, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis across all of the rhizome samples showed that the fungal endophyte community assemblages in the rhizome samples could be grouped according to the presence of two types of active indicator chemicals: Total volatile oils and galangin. Our present results, for the first time, address a diverse fungal endophyte community is able to internally colonize the rhizome tissue of A. officinarum. The diversity of the fungal endophytes found in the A. officinarum rhizome appeared to be closely correlated with the accumulation of active chemicals in the host plant tissue. The present study also provides the first systematic overview of the fungal endophyte communities in plant rhizome tissue using a culture-independent method. © 2014 Shubin et al.",Shubin L.; Juan H.; Renchao Z.; Shiru X.; Yuanxiao J.; Klopfenstein N.B.,PLoS ONE,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0115289,0.947410744414636,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997331417072949,0.00266858292705141,0.999997510811989,2.48918801126763e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

7733,Endophytic Fungal Strains of Soybean for Lipid Production,"Lipids created via microbial biosynthesis are a potential raw material to replace plant-based oil for biodiesel production. Oleaginous microbial species currently available are capable of accumulating high amount of lipids in their cell biomass, but rarely can directly utilize lignocellulosic biomass as substrates. Thus this research focused on the screening and selection of new fungal strains that generate both lipids and hydrolytic enzymes. To search for oleaginous fungal strains in the soybean plant, endophytic fungi and fungi close to the plant roots were studied as a microbial source. Among 33 endophytic fungal isolates screened from the soybean plant, 13 have high lipid content (> 20 % dry biomass weight); among 38 fungal isolates screened from the soil surrounding the soybean roots, 14 have high lipid content. Also, five fungal isolates with both high lipid content and promising biomass production were selected for further studies on their cell growth, oil accumulation, lipid content and profile, utilization of various carbon sources, and cellulase production. The results indicate that most strains could utilize different types of carbon sources and some strains accumulated > 40 % of the lipids based on the dry cell biomass weight. Among these promising strains, some Fusarium strains specifically showed considerable production of cellulase, which offers great potential for biodiesel production by directly utilizing inexpensive lignocellulosic material as feedstock.","Yang, Y; Yan, M; Hu, B",BIOENERGY RESEARCH,2014,10.1007/s12155-013-9377-5,0.987039765291625,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998154641644072,0.00184535835592788,0.99999998511629,1.48837097091459e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

We analysed the gains and losses for both interaction partners and the time factors determining cost dynamics. A hypothesis regarding the relationship between changes in the severity of grass infection with Epichloe fungus, size of fungal sexual structures (stromata), and fly presence (expressed as egg and larvae numbers) was tested. During a 3-year study conducted on permanent field plots, fungal infection of wild grass tussocks of Holcus lanatus and fly visits to fungal stromata were monitored. An increase in the number of shoots with stromata and a reduction in stromata size were observed. From one year to another, flies deposited fewer eggs on stromata, and larval body mass decreased. We explain these results by the deterioration of grass condition due to increased Epichloe infection, which resulted in higher maintenance costs for the fungal parasite.","Stawrakakis, K; Kasprzykowski, Z; Lembicz, M",ARTHROPOD-PLANT INTERACTIONS,2023,10.1007/s11829-023-09992-7,0.888359899054952,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.89572479934005,0.10427520065995,0.999974214493869,2.57855061311929e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

In live field trials BABA sprays resulted in a significant reduction of infectious leaf area and fungal sporulation, and of necrosis of oilspots. The level of disease control for BABA in four trials was similar to that achieved by metalaxyl-Cu or 'Acrobat Plus' (dimethomorph + mancozeb), Two-way tank-mixtures of BABA + fosetyl-Al, BABA + folpet, or BABA + Bion (benzothiadiazole), each at half the recommended rate, provided an additive effect against P. viticola, performing as well as the full rate of each fungicide alone. BABA was not phytotoxic and did not affect pH, total titratable acids, or (o) Brix of the juice, as determined by commercial fungicidal standards.

4616,Simple solution to preserve plant samples for microbiome analyses,"Culture-independent survey techniques are fundamental tools when assessing plant microbiomes. These methods rely on DNA that is carefully preserved after collecting samples to achieve meaningful results. Immediately freezing samples to -80 degrees C after collection is considered one of the most robust methods for preserving samples before DNA extraction but is often impractical. Preservation solutions can solve this problem, but commercially available products are expensive, and there is limited data comparing their efficacy with other preservation methods. In this study, we compared the impact of three methods of sample preservation on plant microbiome surveys: (1) RNAlater, a proprietary preservative, (2) a home-made salt-saturated dimethyl sulphoxide preservation solution (DESS), and (3) freezing at -80 degrees C. DESS-preserved samples, stored at room temperature for up to four weeks, did not show any significant differences to samples frozen at -80 degrees C, while RNAlater inflated bacterial alpha diversity. Preservation treatments did not distinctively influence fungal alpha diversity. Our results demonstrate that DESS is a versatile and inexpensive preservative of DNA in plant material for diversity analyses of fungi and bacteria.","Carvalhais, LC; Dennis, PG; Poudel, A; Birt, HWG; Bhuiyan, SA; Card, SD; Joyce, PA",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES,2022,10.1111/1755-0998.13538,0.956022961403493,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997419070575891,0.0025809294241086,0.999999999977136,2.2864043991432898e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19508,Biosorption optimization of lead(II) and cadmium(II) ions by two novel nanosilica-immobilized fungal mutants.,"This study aims at immobilization of fungal mutants on nanosilica (NSi)-carriers for designing efficient biosorbents as a significant new technology for decontamination practices and maximizing their heavy metal (HM) sorption proficiency through the experimental design methodology. Endophytic fungal mutant strains, Chaetomium globosum El26 mutant and Alternaria alternata S5 mutant were heat inactivated and then immobilized, each separately, on NSi carriers to formulate two separated nano-biosorbents. The formulated NSi-Chaetomium globosum El26 mutant (NSi-Chae El26 m) was investigated for Pb+2 uptake while, the formulated NSi-Alternaria alternata S5 mutant (NSi-Alt S5 m) was investigated for Cd+2 uptake, each through a batch equilibrium protocol. Before and after the metal sorption process, the designed nano-biosorbents were characterized via scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and Fourier transform infrared analysis. Sorption pH, contact time, sorbent concentration, and initial HM concentration were statistically optimized using a Box-Behnken design. Results showed that NSi-Chae El26 m was efficient in Pb+2 uptake with maximum biosorption capacities of 199.0, while NSi-Alt S5 m was efficient in Cd+2 uptake with maximum biosorption capacities of 162.0 mg g-1 . Moreover, the equilibrium data indicated that the adsorption of Pb+2 and Cd+2 by the tested nano-biosorbents fitted to the Freundlich isotherm. The formulated nano-biosorbents resulted in higher HM biosorption of metal ions from aqueous solution than that obtained by the free fungal biomass. The biosorption statistical modelling described the interactions between the tested sorption parameters and predicted the optimum values for maximum HM biosorption capacity by the two designed nano-biosorbents. These findings verify that members of the endophytic fungal genera Alternaria and Chaetomium are suitable to produce nano-biosorbents for decontamination practices after treatment by gamma mutagenesis, heat inactivation, and NSi immobilization.

Only four extracts namely; unidentified fungus (aqueous), Aspergillus sp.JPY2 (methanol), Aspergillus sp.JPY1 (methanol) and Phoma sp. (acetone) significantly reduced blood glucose levels as revealed by glucose tolerance test. It has been observed that in alloxan induced diabetic rats, the maximum reduction in blood glucose level was after 5 hours in the acute treatment experiment and on 14th day in sub acute treatment at a dose of 250mg/kg of body weight (P<0.05). The reduction in blood glucose in long term treatment experiment was ranged from 11.3% to 28.04%, whereas standard drug tolbutamide reduced the blood glucose level up to 40%.

12461,Nutrient Availability Does Not Affect Community Assembly in Root-Associated Fungi but Determines Fungal Effects on Plant Growth,"Nonmycorrhizal root-colonizing fungi are key determinants of plant growth, driving processes ranging from pathogenesis to stress alleviation. Evidence suggests that they might also facilitate host access to soil nutrients in a mycorrhiza-like manner, but the extent of their direct contribution to plant nutrition is unknown. To study how widespread such capacity is across root-colonizing fungi, we surveyed soils in nutrient-limiting habitats using plant baits to look for fungal community changes in response to nutrient conditions. We established a fungal culture collection and used Arabidopsis thaliana inoculation bioassays to assess the ability of fungi to facilitate host's growth in the presence of organic nutrients unavailable to plants. Plant baits captured a representation of fungal communities extant in natural habitats and showed that nutrient limitation has little influence on community assembly. Arabidopsis Mama inoculated with 31 phylogenetically diverse fungi exhibited a consistent fungus-driven growth promotion when supplied with organic nutrients compared to untreated plants. However, direct phosphorus measurement and RNA-seq data did not support enhanced nutrient uptake but rather that growth effects may result from changes in the plant's immune response to colonization. The widespread and consistent host responses to fungal colonization suggest that distinct, locally adapted nonmycorrhizal fungi affect plant performance across habitats. IMPORTANCE Recent studies have shown that root-associated fungi that do not engage in classical mycorrhizal associations can facilitate the hosts' access to nutrients in a mycorrhiza-like manner. However, the generality of this capacity remains to be tested. Root-associated fungi are frequently deemed major determinants of plant diversity and performance, but in the vast majority of cases their ecological roles in nature remain unknown. Assessing how these plant symbionts affect plant productivity, diversity, and fitness is important to understanding how plant communities function. Recent years have seen important advances in the understanding of the main drivers of the diversity and structure of plant microbiomes, but a major challenge is still linking community properties with function. This study contributes to the understanding of the cryptic function of root-associated fungi by testing their ability to participate in a specific process: nutrient acquisition by plants.","Maciá-Vicente, JG; Bai, B; Qi, R; Ploch, S; Breider, F; Thines, M",MSYSTEMS,2022,10.1128/msystems.00304-22,0.933685632455971,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991958245823226,0.00804175417677432,0.99999999626963,3.7303703459556906e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

12425,Fungal succession on the decomposition of three plant species from a Brazilian mangrove,"Leaf decomposition is the primary process in release of nutrients in the dynamic mangrove habitat, supporting the ecosystem food webs. On most environments, fungi are an essential part of this process. However, due to the peculiarities of mangrove forests, this group is currently neglected. Thus, this study tests the hypothesis that fungal communities display a specific succession pattern in different mangrove species and this due to differences in their ecological role. A molecular approach was employed to investigate the dynamics of the fungal community during the decomposition of three common plant species (Rhizophora mangle, Laguncularia racemosa, and Avicennia schaueriana) from a mangrove habitat located at the southeast of Brazil. Plant material was the primary driver of fungi communities, but time also was marginally significant for the process, and evident changes in the fungal community during the decomposition process were observed. The five most abundant classes common to all the three plant species were Saccharomycetes, Sordariomycetes, Tremellomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, and Dothideomycetes, all belonging to the Phylum Ascomycota. Microbotryomycetes class were shared only by A. schaueriana and L. racemosa, while Agaricomycetes class were shared by L. racemosa and R. mangle. The class Glomeromycetes were shared by A. schaueriana and R. mangle. The analysis of the core microbiome showed that Saccharomycetes was the most abundant class. In the variable community, Sordariomycetes was the most abundant one, mainly in the Laguncularia racemosa plant. The results presented in this work shows a specialization of the fungal community regarding plant material during litter decomposition which might be related to the different chemical composition and rate of degradation.","Moitinho, MA; Chiaramonte, JB; Bononi, L; Gumiere, T; Melo, IS; Taketani, RG",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2022,10.1038/s41598-022-18667-x,0.838623175448515,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999987096575868,1.29034241321659e-5,0.999999997026957,2.9730433670494e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Thermal IR source images of hyphae have been acquired with a 64 x 64 element focal plane array detector; single point IR spectra have been obtained with synchrotron source light. In some C. protuberata hyphae, we have discovered the spectral signature of crystalline mannitol, a fungal polyol with complex protective roles. With FTIR-FPA imaging, we have determined that the protein content in cells remains fairly constant throughout the length of a hypha, whereas the mannitol is found at discrete, irregular locations. This is the first direct observation of mannitol in intact fungal hyphae. Since the concentration of mannitol in cells varies with respect to position and is not present in all hyphae, this discovery may be related to habitat adaptation, fungal structure and growth stages.","Isenor, M; Kaminskyj, SGW; Rodriguez, RJ; Redman, RS; Gough, KM",ANALYST,2010,10.1039/c0an00534g,0.941073076678432,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999951756658739,4.82433412609115e-5,0.999999999999987,1.31006316905768e-14,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The indole alkaloid 7 displayed antitumor activity in a panel of 36 human tumor cell lines, exhibiting a mean IC50 value of 5.5 mu g/mL in an in vitro survival and proliferation assay. Furthermore, compounds 3 and 4 showed moderate antitumor activity toward individual tumor cell lines. None of compounds 1-8 exhibited any immunostimulatory activity assessed as the capacity to induce cytokines in PBMCs from healthy donors.","Kralj, A; Kehraus, S; Krick, A; Eguereva, E; Kelter, G; Maurer, M; Wortmann, A; Fiebig, HH; König, GM",JOURNAL OF NATURAL PRODUCTS,2006,10.1021/np050454f,0.913196843755419,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999588888923462,4.111110765383e-4,0.999999999857212,1.42787781598486e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1130,Occurrence of arbuscular mycorrhizas and dark septate endophytes in hydrophytes from lakes and streams in southwest China,"In this study, the colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) in 140 specimens of 32 hydrophytes collected from four lakes and four streams in southwest China were investigated. The arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and DSE colonization in these hydrophytes were rare. Typical AM structures were observed in one of the 25 hydrophytic species collected in lakes and six of the 17 species collected in streams. Spores of 10 identified AMF species and an unidentified Acaulospora sp. were isolated from the sediments. The identified AMF came from the four genera, Acaulospora, Gigaspora, Glomus and Scutellospora. Glomus and G. mosseae were the dominant genus and species respectively in these aquatic environments. The presence of DSE in hydrophytes was recorded for the first time. DSE occurred in one of the 25 hydrophyte species collected in lakes and three of the 17 species collected in streams.","Kai, W; Zhao, ZW",INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF HYDROBIOLOGY,2006,10.1002/iroh.200510827,0.933787661395553,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.682900464350517,0.317099535649483,0.991697525131274,0.0083024748687256,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
11376,Detection and management of downy mildew in rose rootstock,"A technique utilizing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed to investigate the occurrence and location of Peronospora sparsa in dormant, woody rose tissues. PCR primers were designed to amplify the internal transcribed spacer region of the ribosomal DNA of the pathogen. Inhibition of the reaction by plant compounds was minimized by optimizing the reagents used in the extraction of DNA from roses and in the amplification reaction. The PCR assay was capable of detecting as little as 2 pg of DNA from P. sparsa against a background of 4 ng of DNA from rose cane cortex. With this method, DNA of R sparsa was detected in the cortex of stem and root tissues of symptomatic plants. Pathogen DNA also was detected in the cortex of crown tissues of asymptomatic mother plants used as a source of propagation materials. Epifluorescent and differential interference contrast microscopy were used to confirm the presence of abundant hyphae and oospores within the stem cortex of infected canes. Preplant treatments of dormant rootstock cuttings in fungicides or hot water were evaluated during natural outbreaks of the disease in commercial rose nurseries. In three trials conducted over 2 years, a 10-min preplant dip in the systemic fungicides metalaxyl or mefenoxam at rates of 100 to 10,000 mg a.i./liter reduced the area under the disease progress curve by 63 to 76% relative to nontreated plots. The evidence from PCR assays, microscopy, and fungicide trials all support the occurrence of perennating infections of P. sparsa within rose.","Aegerter, BJ; Nuñez, JJ; Davis, RM",PLANT DISEASE,2002,10.1094/PDIS.2002.86.12.1363,0.858716416079498,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985518970155036,0.0144810298449636,0.999999585314482,4.14685518479452e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1888,Connecting plant-microbial interactions above and belowground: a fungal endophyte affects decomposition,"Mutualisms can strongly affect the structure of communities, but their influence on ecosystem processes is not well resolved. Here we show that a plant-microbial mutualism affects the rate of leaf litter decomposition using the widespread interaction between tall fescue grass (Lolium arundinaceum) and the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum. In grasses, fungal endophytes live symbiotically in the aboveground tissues, where the fungi gain protection and nutrients from their host and often protect host plants from biotic and abiotic stress. In a field experiment, decomposition rate depended on a complex interaction between the litter source (collected from endophyte-infected or endophyte-free plots), the decomposition microenvironment (endophyte-infected or endophyte-free plots), and the presence of mesoinvertebrates (manipulated by the mesh size of litter bags). Over all treatments, decomposition was slower for endophyte-infected fescue litter than for endophyte-free litter. When mesoinvertebrates were excluded using fine mesh and litter was placed in a microenvironment with the endophyte, the difference between endophyte-infected and endophyte-free litter was strongest. In the presence of mesoinvertebrates, endophyte-infected litter decomposed faster in microenvironments with the endophyte than in microenvironments lacking the endophyte, suggesting that plots differ in the detritivore assemblage. Indeed, the presence of the endophyte in plots shifted the composition of Collembola, with more Hypogastruridae in the presence of the endophyte and more Isotomidae in endophyte-free plots. In a separate outdoor pot experiment, we did not find strong effects of the litter source or the soil microbial/microinvertebrate community on decomposition, which may reflect differences between pot and field conditions or other differences in methodology. Our work is among the first to demonstrate an effect of plant-endophyte mutualisms on ecosystem processes under field conditions.","Lemons, A; Clay, K; Rudgers, JA",OECOLOGIA,2005,10.1007/s00442-005-0163-8,0.991484094158105,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999129905777058,8.7009422294185e-4,0.999999999994982,5.01787500439832e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

(purple coneflower), a medicinal plant commonly used in the treatment of colds, flu and related ailments. Echinacea seeds were found to be contaminated with systemic fungi and therefore an optimized minimal concentration of Plant Preservation Mixture (PPM) was incorporated in the seed germination medium to recover sterile seedlings. Regeneration was induced on petiole explants from 2-month-old sterile seedlings cultured on medium supplemented with benzylaminopurine (BAP) or thidiazuron (TDZ) in combination with indoleacetic acid (IAA). Two distinct forms of regeneration were identified in cultured petiole explants with histological and morphological observations, viz. the direct formation of somatic embryos on the epidermis and the de novo development of shoots from callus tissues formed in subepidermal cell layers.

18253,Dracaena sanderiana endophytic bacteria interactions: Effect of endophyte inoculation on bisphenol A removal.,"Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the most abundant endocrine-disrupting compounds which is found in the aquatic environment. However, actual knowledge regarding the effect of plant-bacteria interactions on enhancing BPA removal is still lacking. In the present study, Dracaena sanderiana endophytic bacteria interactions were investigated to evaluate the effect of bacterial inoculation on BPA removal under hydroponic conditions. Two plant growth-promoting (PGP) bacterial strains, Bacillus thuringiensis and Pantoea dispersa, which have high BPA tolerance and can utilize BPA for growth, were used as plant inocula. P. dispersa-inoculated plants showed the highest BPA removal efficiency at 92.32 ± 1.23% compared to other inoculated and non-inoculated plants. This was due to a higher population of the endophytic inoculum within the plant tissues which resulted in maintained levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) for the plant's physiological needs and lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In contrast, B. thuringiensis-inoculated plants had a lower BPA removal efficiency. However, individual B. thuringiensis possessed a significantly higher BPA removal efficiency compared to P. dispersa. This study provides convincing evidence that not all PGP endophytic bacteria-plant interactions could improve the BPA removal efficiency. Different inocula and inoculation times should be investigated before using plant inoculation to enhance phytoremediation.",Suyamud B; Thiravetyan P; Panyapinyopol B; Inthorn D,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2018,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.03.066,0.978077839809238,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.975341636225945,0.0246583637740549,0.999999893165888,1.06834111668341e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

However, no information is available about the growth of this entomopathogenic fungus in the presence of other endophytic fungi, which are usually found in plant tissues. Effects of fungal interactions vary from inhibiting the activity of a biocontrol agent to stimulating its effect on the targeted pathogen. This study compared the growth rate of Beauveria felina alone and in interaction with other endophytic fungi. In the presence of each competitor (Gliomastix polychroma or Rhodotorula mucilaginosa), B. felina grew faster than in the control. In the interaction between Beauveria felina and Gliomastix polychroma, an inhibition zone was formed between their mycelia.

15665,Development of an ecological strategy for the control of downy mildew (Pseudoperonospora cubensis) in cucumber cultivation (Cucumis sativus L.),"Downy mildew is a severe disease of cucumber worldwide. The oomycete Pseudoperonospora cubensis cause it and once it is established in a region, the infection spreads rapidly, causing significant loss of yield and fruit quality. The objective of the research was to develop an ecological strategy for the control of downy mildew in cucumber. The treatments were arranged in a completely randomized experimental design with an alternation of chemical and biological fungicides. The treatments were: T1: systemic fungicide (Ridomil Gold, 2.5 g/l) alternating with a contact fungicide (Bravo 2.5 ml/l), T2: CustomBio 5 (Bacillus-based fungicide, 3ml/l), T3: control (water), T4: Trichoderma sp. (3 ml/l), T5: systemic fungicide (Ridomil Gold 2.5g/l) alternating with CustomBio 5 (3 ml/l), and T6: systemic fungicide (Ridomil Gold 2.5g/l) alternating with Trichoderma sp. (3 ml/l). The following variables were evaluated: stem thickness, plant height, number and weight of fruits, yield, the area under the relative progress curve (AUDPCr), and economic analysis of each treatment. The results showed that the best treatments were T1 and T6, with an AUDPCr of 11.89% and 12.10%, respectively. Treatments T6 and T1 showed the best yield, as well. The profitability analysis showed that all the alternatives were profitable with a Benefit/Cost>1 ratio. However, the treatments T6 and T1 were the most useful. We recommend this control strategy to reduce the use of chemical fungicides and, at the same time, obtain an efficient control of the disease, which guarantees a significant yield of high-quality fruit. © 2020 The Author(s).

6959,BIODEGRADATION OF 4-CHLORO-2-METHYLPHENOXYACETIC ACID BY ENDOPHYTIC FUNGUS PHOMOPSIS SP. IN LIQUID MEDIUM AND SOIL,"An endophytic fungus strain, newly isolated from Psidium guajava (common guava), could effectively degrade 4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA). According to the analysis of its phenotypic feature and ITS rDNA gene sequence, the isolated strain was identified as Phomopsis sp. and named E41. The influencing factors including medium pH, temperature, and initial concentration of MCPA affecting the degradation of MCPA by this strain were optimized in this study. The maximum biodegradation rate of 86.89% was obtained after inoculation for 7 days under the optimal conditions with MCPA concentration of 50 mg/L, temperature 30 ?C and a pH of 6. The metabolite 4-chloro-2-methylphenol was detected by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In the bioremediation experiment, the biodegradation of MCPA was significantly enhanced in all soils with the presence of the strain E41. These results suggested that the strain E41 may have potential value for the bioremediation of MCPA-contaminated environment.","Wang, Y; Feng, G; Li, H; Du, L; Zeng, D",APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH,2021,10.15666/aeer/1902_12951307,0.960280590276962,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.975416789860141,0.0245832101398593,0.992278970415811,0.00772102958418941,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1455,Comparative genomics and transcriptomics depict ericoid mycorrhizal fungi as versatile saprotrophs and plant mutualists,"Some soil fungi in the Leotiomycetes form ericoid mycorrhizal (ERM) symbioses with Ericaceae. In the harsh habitats in which they occur, ERM plant survival relies on nutrient mobilization from soil organic matter (SOM) by their fungal partners. The characterization of the fungal genetic machinery underpinning both the symbiotic lifestyle and SOM degradation is needed to understand ERM symbiosis functioning and evolution, and its impact on soil carbon (C) turnover. We sequenced the genomes of the ERM fungi Meliniomyces bicolor, M. variabilis, Oidiodendron maius and Rhizoscyphus ericae, and compared their gene repertoires with those of fungi with different lifestyles (ecto- and orchid mycorrhiza, endophytes, saprotrophs, pathogens). We also identified fungal transcripts induced in symbiosis. The ERM fungal gene contents for polysaccharide-degrading enzymes, lipases, proteases and enzymes involved in secondary metabolism are closer to those of saprotrophs and pathogens than to those of ectomycorrhizal symbionts. The fungal genes most highly upregulated in symbiosis are those coding for fungal and plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs), lipases, proteases, transporters and mycorrhiza-induced small secreted proteins (MiSSPs). The ERM fungal gene repertoire reveals a capacity for a dual saprotrophic and biotrophic lifestyle. This may reflect an incomplete transition from saprotrophy to the mycorrhizal habit, or a versatile life strategy similar to fungal endophytes.","Martino, E; Morin, E; Grelet, GA; Kuo, A; Kohler, A; Daghino, S; Barry, KW; Cichocki, N; Clum, A; Dockter, RB; Hainaut, M; Kuo, RC; LaButti, K; Lindahl, BD; Lindquist, EA; Lipzen, A; Khouja, HR; Magnuson, J; Murat, C; Ohm, RA; Singer, SW; Spatafora, JW; Wang, M; Veneault-Fourrey, C; Henrissat, B; Grigoriev, IV; Martin, FM; Perotto, S",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,2018,10.1111/nph.14974,0.886579389977603,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996927564201833,0.0030724357981669,0.9999922018459,7.79815410023588e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19536,Insights into the beneficial roles of dark septate endophytes in plants under challenging environment: resilience to biotic and abiotic stresses.,"Dark septate endophytes (DSE) exert a plethora of effects in regulating plant growth, signalling and stress tolerance. The advent of metagenomics has led to the identification of various species of DSE to be associated with plant organs. They are known to modulate growth, nutrient uptake, phytohormone biosynthesis and production of active bioconstituents in several plants. The interactions between the DSE and host plants are mostly mutualistic but they can also be neutral or exhibit negative interactions. The DSE has beneficial role in removal/sequestration of toxic heavy metals from various environmental sites. Here, we discuss the beneficial role of DSE in enhancing plant tolerance to heavy metal stress, drought conditions, high salinity and protection from various plant pathogens. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism of stress resilience facilitated by DSE-plant interaction has also been discussed.

15942,Plant growth-promoting characteristics of root fungal endophytes isolated from a traditional cordillera rice landrace,"This study was conducted to isolate and characterize the plant growth-promoting potential of fungal endophytes from the roots of Diket red, a traditional rice plant from the Cordillera, Northern Luzon. Eighteen morphospecies of filamentous endophytes were isolated of which twelve isolates were successfully identified to the species level. These isolates were identified as Aspergillus versicolor, Aspergillus sp., Chaetosphaeria sp., Cladosporium cladosporioides, Hypocrea lixii, Microascus murinus, and Trichoderma harzianum. The identified twelve isolates were selected to screen in vitro for their plant growth-promoting characteristics, and evaluated in vivo for their beneficial effects on seedling vigor and early seedling growth. Isolate PPL14 produced the highest IAA at 55.5 μg ml-1 and M. murinus PPL10 produced the highest amount of IAA at 3.73 μg IAA mg-1 dry mycelia wt. The seedling vigor assay and in vivo plant growth promotion bioassay indicated overall positive effects of culture filtrate (CF) application of the endophyte isolates. Rice seeds and seedlings grown in aseptic condition and treated with endophyte CFs displayed significantly enhanced levels of germination, seedling vigor, shoot, root, and total plant growth, and biomass compared to non-treated control. Other plant growth-promoting characteristics were also studied including phosphate solubilization, siderophore production, ammonia production, and catalase activity.

4061,Soil microbial composition varies in response to coffee agroecosystem management,"Soil microbes are essential to the continued productivity of sustainably managed agroecosystems. In shade coffee plantations, the relationship between soil microbial composition, soil nutrient availability and coffee productivity have been demonstrated, but the effects of management on the composition of the soil microbial communities remains relatively unexplored. To further understand how management modulates the soil microbiome, the soil fungal and bacterial communities, soil chemistry, and canopy composition were surveyed in a Nicaraguan coffee cooperative, across 19 individual farms. Amplicon sequencing analyses showed that management (organic or conventional), stand age and previous land use affected the soil microbiome, albeit in different ways. Bacterial communities were most strongly associated with soil chemistry, while fungal communities were more strongly associated with the composition of the canopy and historical land use of the coffee plantation. Notably, both fungal and bacterial richness decreased with stand age. In addition to revealing the first in-depth characterization of the soil microbiome in coffee plantations in Nicaragua, these results highlight how fungal and bacterial communities are simultaneously modulated by long-term land use legacies (i.e. an agricultural plot's previous land use) and short-term press disturbance (i.e. farm age).","Jurburg, SD; Shek, KL; McGuire, K",FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY,2020,10.1093/femsec/fiaa164,0.977128637056199,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999822183621377,1.7781637862304e-4,0.999999796032729,2.03967271406036e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12775,Isolation and Characterisation of Plant Growth-Promoting Bacterial and Fungal Endophytes from Himalayan Yew (Taxus wallichiana) - An Economically Imperative Pant of Himalayas,"It is a known fact that the bacterial and fungal endophytes inhabit the plant tissues besides aiding in the better growth and health of the plants. The bark and leaves of Taxus wallichiana have drawn a lot of interest in recent years since they are the richest source of taxol, an anticancer drug. As it is a slow-growing tree that can only be regenerated via vegetative propagation, it has been classified as a critical rare species due to its extensive collection for medicinal and other purposes. Nonetheless, the use of endophytes as plant growth promoters is gaining much importance among environmentalists and agronomists because of their imperative role in crop production. Even then, there is hardly any information available regarding the growth-promoting endophytes isolated from bark and leaves associated with T. wallichiana commonly known as Himalayan Yew. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to isolate fungal and bacterial endophytes from T. wallichiana and to classify the growth-promoting properties of these endophytes. In total, seven fungal and ten bacterial endophytes were obtained from different parts of T. wallichiana. All of the isolated fungal and bacterial endophytes produced indole acetic acid while most of them also produced ammonia. Besides, the fungal and bacterial endophytes were also screened for antimicrobial and various enzymatic activities. Based on the above results, the two fungal endophytes were selected for their possible ability to promote seed growth. The results showed that the fungal endophytes isolated from T. wallichiana played an active role in increasing growth in other plant species and therefore, can be used as potential plant growth promoters.","Khan, SS; Verma, V; Rasool, S",SAINS MALAYSIANA,2022,10.17576/jsm-2022-5109-05,0.985987477852166,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.945010422789966,0.0549895772100342,0.999954293777245,4.57062227553484e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

16298,Data mining and molecular dynamics analysis to detect HIV-1 reverse transcriptase RNase H activity inhibitor,"HIV-1 is a deadly virus that affects millions of people worldwide. In this study, we aimed to inhibit viral replication by targeting one of the HIV-1 proteins and identifying a new drug candidate. We used data mining and molecular dynamics methods on HIV-1 genomes. Based on MAUVE analysis, we selected the RNase H activity of the reverse transcriptase (R.T) enzyme as a potential target due to its low mutation rate and high conservation level. We screened about 94,000 small molecule inhibitors by virtual screening. We validated the hit compounds' stability and binding free energy through molecular dynamics simulations and MM/PBSA. Phomoarcherin B, known for its anticancer properties, emerged as the best candidate and showed potential as an HIV-1 reverse transcriptase RNase H activity inhibitor. This study presents a new target and drug candidate for HIV-1 treatment. However, in vitro and in vivo tests are required. Also, the effect of RNase H activity on viral replication and the interaction of Phomoarcherin B with other HIV-1 proteins should be investigated. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Ghafoor N.A.; Kırboğa K.K.; Baysal Ö.; Süzek B.E.; Silme R.S.,Molecular Diversity,2024,10.1007/s11030-023-10707-6,0.862559607360908,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.566153582373081,0.433846417626919,0.999978434682178,2.15653178218256e-5,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
2920,"Precipitation, Not Land Use, Primarily Determines the Composition of Both Plant and Phyllosphere Fungal Communities","Plant communities and fungi inhabiting their phyllospheres change along precipitation gradients and often respond to changes in land use. Many studies have focused on the changes in foliar fungal communities on specific plant species, however, few have addressed the association between whole plant communities and their phyllosphere fungi. We sampled plant communities and associated phyllosphere fungal communities in native prairie remnants and post-agricultural sites across the steep precipitation gradient in the central plains in Kansas, USA. Plant community cover data and MiSeq ITS2 metabarcode data of the phyllosphere fungal communities indicated that both plant and fungal community composition respond strongly to mean annual precipitation (MAP), but less so to land use (native prairie remnants vs. post-agricultural sites). However, plant and fungal diversity were greater in the native remnant prairies than in post-agricultural sites. Overall, both plant and fungal diversity increased with MAP and the communities in the arid and mesic parts of the gradient were distinct. Analyses of the linkages between plant and fungal communities (Mantel and Procrustes tests) identified strong correlations between the composition of the two. However, despite the strong correlations, regression models with plant richness, diversity, or composition (ordination axis scores) and land use as explanatory variables for fungal diversity and evenness did not improve the models compared to those with precipitation and land use (Delta AIC < 2), even though the explanatory power of some plant variables was greater than that of MAP as measured by R-2. Indicator taxon analyses suggest that grass species are the primary taxa that differ in the plant communities. Similar analyses of the phyllosphere fungi indicated that many plant pathogens are disproportionately abundant either in the arid or mesic environments. Although decoupling the drivers of fungal communities and their composition - whether abiotic or host-dependent - remains a challenge, our study highlights the distinct community responses to precipitation and the tight tracking of the plant communities by their associated fungal symbionts.","Dea, HI; Urban, A; Kazarina, A; Houseman, GR; Thomas, SG; Loecke, T; Greer, MJ; Platt, TG; Lee, S; Jumpponen, A",FRONTIERS IN FUNGAL BIOLOGY,2022,10.3389/ffunb.2022.805225,0.987548176186376,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999862614184429,1.3738581557113e-4,0.999999973720394,2.62796059358195e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12179,Genetic mapping of common bunt resistance and plant height QTL in wheat,"Key message Breeding for field resistance to common bunt in wheat will need to account for multiple genes and epistatic and QTL by environment interactions. Loci associated with quantitative resistance to common bunt are co-localized with other beneficial traits including plant height and rust resistance. Common bunt, also known as stinking smut, is caused by seed borne fungi Tilletia tritici (Bjerk.) Wint. [syn. Tilletia caries (DC.) Tul.] and Tilletia laevis Kuhn [syn. Tilletia foetida (Wallr.) Liro.]. Common bunt is known to cause grain yield and quality losses in wheat due to bunt ball formation and infestation of the grain. The objectives of this research were to identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for common bunt resistance, to study the epistatic interactions between the identified QTL, and investigate the co-localization of bunt resistance with plant height. A population of 261 doubled haploid lines from the cross Carberry/AC Cadillac and checks were genotyped with polymorphic genome wide microsatellite and DArTA (R) markers. The lines were grown in 2011, 2012, and 2013 in separate nurseries for common bunt incidence and height evaluation. AC Cadillac contributed a QTL (QCbt.spa-6D) for common bunt resistance on chromosome 6D at markers XwPt-1695, XwPt-672044, and XwPt-5114. Carberry contributed QTL for bunt resistance on chromosomes 1B (QCbt.spa-1B at XwPt743523) 4B (QCbt.spa-4B at XwPt-744434-Xwmc617), 4D (QCbt.spa-4D at XwPt-9747), 5B (QCbt.spa-5B at XtPt-3719) and 7D (QCbt.spa-7D at Xwmc273). Significant epistatic interactions were identified for percent bunt incidence between QCbt.spa-1B x QCbt.spa-4B and QCbt.spa-1B x QCbt.spa-6D, and QTL by environment interaction between QCbt.spa-1B x QCbt.spa-6D. Plant height QTL were found on chromosomes 4B (QPh.spa-4B) and 6D (QPh.spa-6D) that co-located with bunt resistance QTL. The identification of previously unreported common bunt resistance QTL (on chromosomes 4B, 4D and 7D), and new understanding of QTL x QTL interactions will facilitate marker-assisted breeding for common bunt resistance.","Singh, A; Knox, RE; DePauw, RM; Singh, AK; Cuthbert, RD; Kumar, S; Campbell, HL",THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS,2016,10.1007/s00122-015-2624-8,0.980918732322201,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.626400217173719,0.373599782826281,0.999807072959103,1.9292704089746e-4,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
742,The impact of polyphenolic compounds on the in vitro growth of oak-associated foliar endophytic and saprotrophic fungi,"Foliar fungal endophytes are horizontally transmitted symbionts that inhabit healthy, photosynthetic tissues of all lineages of land plants where they influence plant health and productivity. Endophyte communities often are more similar among closely related hosts, potentially as a result of a preference for particular morphological, ecophysiological, or chemical host traits. However, the various ecological and evolutionary factors that drive community assembly often are difficult to disentangle. Here, we examined the impact of six polyphenolic compounds on the growth of 15 phylogenetically diverse Quercus (oak)-associated fungal species and assessed whether tolerance to phenolics is associated with their degree of specialization to oaks in nature. Despite frequently reported antifungal properties of phenolics, we found that oak-associated fungi grew the same or better than positive controls in 78% of trials with all compounds, although fungal sensitivity differed as a function of compound type and concentration. Overall, species with high specificity to Quercus had the greatest tolerance to phenolics, whereas generalists were more sensitive. Differences between generalists and specialists suggest that variation in phenolic abundance and composition among oaks may act as a selective filter that influences endophyte host associations in nature.","Nickerson, MN; Moore, LP; U'Ren, JM",FUNGAL ECOLOGY,2023,10.1016/j.funeco.2023.101226,0.95187269409386,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999712153107578,2.8784689242162e-4,0.99999999997851,2.1489809931551898e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) was quantified. Colonization by AMF appeared to be more frequent in the fen meadow than in the peat bog, and depended on the host plant. Roots of S. tinctoria and B. officinalis were well colonized by AMF in the fen meadow (35-55% root length) and both arbuscules and vesicles were observed to occur in spring as well as in autumn. In the peat bog, L. inundata showed a low level of root colonization in spring, when vesicles were found frequently but no arbuscules. In roots of D. intermedia from the peat bog, arbuscules and vesicles were observed, but AMF colonization was lower than in L. inundata. In contrast, the amount of AMF spores extracted from soil at the peat bog site was higher than from the fen meadow soil. Spore numbers did not differ between spring and autumn in the fen meadow, but they were higher in spring than in autumn in the peat bog. Acaulospora laevis or A. colossica and Glomus etunicatum were identified amongst the AMF spores extracted from soil at the two sites. S. tinctoria and B. officinalis roots were also regularly colonized by DSE (18-40% root length), while L. inundata was only rarely colonized and D. intermedia did not seem to be colonized by DSE at all.","Fuchs, B; Haselwandter, K",MYCORRHIZA,2004,10.1007/s00572-004-0314-5,0.972044901834241,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99972898656788,2.7101343212009e-4,0.999999939962548,6.00374516768198e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

8585,Tank mix application of copper hydroxide either with cyproconazole or pyraclostrobin fungicides reduced the control of coffee leaf rust,"Coffee leaf rust (CLR) is a major disease that occurs in all coffee-growing regions, and chemical control is the most effective strategy to control the disease. Usually, this control is based on the application of contact and/or systemic fungicides to the foliage of the plants, and a very common practice is the use of tank-mix solution of fungicides to reduce the costs of the application. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of mixtures of systemic fungicides (triazoles and strobilurins) and copper hydroxide on the germination of uredospores of Hemileia vastatrix and on the control of CLR. The results showed that the effectiveness of a fungicide can be affected when used in mixtures with another fungicide, resulting in ineffective disease control. When copper hydroxide was combined with cyproconazole, the inhibition of uredospore germination was lower than when copper hydroxide was used alone. For both fungicides pyraclostrobin and cyproconazole, effectiveness in the control of CLR was reduced with the presence of copper hydroxide in the mixture, and this loss in efficacy may be associated with the occurrence of alkaline hydrolysis of the fungicides when they are mixed with copper hydroxide.

Consequently, a total of 109 endophytic bacteria affiliated to 3 phyla, 12 orders and 36 genera were isolated using nine different selective media, from which, Actinobacteria was the dominant taxon containing seven orders at the phylum level; Micrococcales showed the highest diversity containing 12 genera at the family level. Based on PAST and SPSS analysis, species diversity and abundance were mostly isolated from nutritious soil condition (22 genera) and root tissue (27 genera). Furthermore, growth phase showed significant effect on the endophytic bacteria community (28 genera at dormancy and 17 genera at fluorescence stage). With regard to ex situ plant growth-promoting activities, Streptomyces dominated and exhibited broad ability in terms of their potential to grow on nitrogen-free media, synthesize cellulase and lipase enzymes. Characterization of potential plant-beneficial traits indicate that endophytic bacteria exhibited a number of positive activities, including potential diazotrophy (n = 66), phosphate-solubilizing (n = 6), production of lipase (n = 21) and cellulose (n = 35).

20739,Isolation and biological activity of endophytic fungi from Withania somnifera,"Virtually all plants are hosts to bacteria and fungi that can be classified as endophytes. Endophytes are 'microbes that colonize living internal tissues of plants without causing any immediate, overt negative effects'. Many endophytes produce a variety of bioactive molecules, which is currently attracting worldwide scientific investigations towards isolation and exploration of their biotechnological promise. In the present study, Withania somnifera (F: Solanaceae) which produces withanine and withanolides used to cure various diseases was selected for exploring the endophytes associated with it. A total 15 endophytic fungi were isolated from different parts of plant like root, stem and leaf. Surface sterilization of plant material was achieved using sodium hypochlorite (10% or 20% v/v) for 10 min. The fungi were isolated by incubating the plant material on potato dextrose agar supplemented with streptomycin (250 mgl-1) at 27°. The fungal strains were identified by studying their morphological and microscopical characteristics. The fungi were fermented as static cultures in potato dextrose broth for 21 day at 27°C. The culture broth and mycelium were extracted with ethyl acetate and acetone respectively. The combined extracts were tested for antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. Aspergillus sp. (WSF-6) and Mycelia sterilia (WSF-14) showed maximum activity against bacteria B. subtilis, S. aureus, E. coli while Cladosporium sp. (WSF-15) was most active against fungi A. niger and C. albicans.

6537,Antimicrobial and Cytotoxic Activities of the Secondary Metabolites of Endophytic Fungi Isolated from the Medicinal Plant Hyssopus officinalis,"According to the World Health Organization, it is estimated that by 2050, drug-resistant infections could cause up to 10 million deaths annually. Therefore, finding a new generation of antibiotics is crucial. Natural compounds from endophytic fungi are considered a potential source of new-generation antibiotics. The antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of ethyl acetate extracts of nine endophytic fungal isolates obtained from Hyssopus officinalis were investigated for bioassay-guided isolation of the natural compounds. An extract of isolate VII showed the highest antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus (30.12 & PLUSMN; 0.20 mm and 35.21 & PLUSMN; 0.20 mm) and Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30.41 & PLUSMN; 0.23 mm and 25.12 & PLUSMN; 0.25 mm) among the tested extracts of isolates. Molecular identification of isolate VII confirmed it as Chaetomium elatum based on sequencing of its ITS genes, and it was discovered that this was the first time C. elatum had been isolated from H. officinalis. This isolate was cultured at a large scale for the isolation and identification of the active compound. Penicillic acid was isolated for the first time from C. elatum and its chemical structure was established by NMR spectroscopy. The penicillic acid showed strong antibacterial activities against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus with 20.68 mm and 25.51 mm inhibition zones, respectively. In addition, MIC and MBC values and antibiofilm activities of penicillic acid were determined. It was found that penicillic acid reduced the level of biofilms in proportion to antibacterial activity.","Eshboev, F; Karakozova, M; Abdurakhmanov, J; Bobakulov, K; Dolimov, K; Abdurashidov, A; Baymirzaev, A; Makhnyov, A; Terenteva, E; Sasmakov, S; Piyakina, G; Egamberdieva, D; Nazarov, PA; Azimova, S",ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL,2023,10.3390/antibiotics12071201,0.96321497811413,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.880494864727845,0.119505135272155,0.997565005787614,0.0024349942123858,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

14935,Bioactivity of crude extract produced by endophytic fungi isolated from Ziziphus spina-christi (Nabq) leaves for antimicrobial evaluation as well as optimization of culture medium conditions,"Twenty fungal endophytes were isolated from Nabq, and plug diffusion screening revealed four of those isolates to be promising. These isolates were identified molecularly as Aspergillus sp. of Sect. Flavi (ZSEFL2) and Sec. Niger (ZSEFL14), and Penicillium spp. closest related to Penicillum crustosum (ZSEFL15, 19). Investigations were conducted to determine the effects of culture parameters, such as the type of culture medium, incubation temperature, initial pH and agitation, on the production of antimicrobial metabolites in a culture filtrate extract. Using the disk diffusion technique, antimicrobial metabolite synthesis was evaluated. In comparison to the other three distinct culture media (PDB-y, rice, and Cz), PDB demonstrated to be the best culture medium for the four tested fungal endophytes, exhibiting high levels of the Antimicrobial Index (AI). Also, a restricted range of incubation temperatures resulted in the formation of bioactive metabolites, but raising the incubation temperatures from 25 to 30 °C increased the amount of bioactive metabolites produced. Moreover, the best initial hydrogen concentration typically ranged from pH 5 to 6. Finally, when the conditions changed from stationary to shaking, the bioactive secondary metabolite's antimicrobial efficacy reduced. The behavior of the four examined fungal isolates was consistent, and they all required the same conditions to produce the most bioactive metabolites. Moreover, ethyl acetate extract's MIC values against the investigated bacterial and fungal human pathogens ranged from 0.19 to 6.25 mg/mL. © 2023 SAAB",Farouk H.M.; Hashem Z.S.; Attia E.Z.; Shaban G.M.; Glaeser S.P.; Kämpfer P.; Abdelmohsen U.R.; El-Katatny M.H.,South African Journal of Botany,2023,10.1016/j.sajb.2023.08.071,0.989702552621603,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.41106169102839,0.58893830897161,0.997106455705776,0.00289354429422439,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

We evaluated whether the core and satellite fungal communities in five pine species (Pinus radiata, Pinus pinaster, Pinus sylvestris, Pinus nigra, and Pinus uncinata) were shaped by the host species identity. Because the trees had earlier been inoculated with a fungal pathogen (Fusarium circinatum), we also explored the possibilities to detect its presence and potential co-occurrence networks. We found interspecific variation in the fungal community composition and abundance among the different tree species and the existence of a core microbiome that was independent of the host species. The presence of F. circinatum was confirmed in some samples through qPCR but the pathogen did not co-occur with a specific fungal community. The results highlight the importance of host species as a determinant of microbiome assembly in common environments.","Romeralo, C; Martín-García, J; Martínez-Alvarez, P; Muñoz-Adalia, EJ; Gonçalves, DR; Torres, E; Witzell, J; Diez, JJ",FUNGAL ECOLOGY,2022,10.1016/j.funeco.2021.101137,0.957570215005833,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999661139817652,3.3886018234762e-4,0.999999993371979,6.6280214650049604e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1956,Effects of the co-inoculation with saprobe and mycorrhizal fungi on Vaccinium corymbosum growth and some soil enzymatic activities,"In this study we evaluated the initial plant growth and some biochemical changes produced in rizhosphere soil of blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) cv. 'Elliot' plantlets obtained from in vitro culture and inoculated with six arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi strains (Gigaspora rosea; Glomus claroideum; G. deserticola; G. viscosum; G. intraradices and G. constrictum) and five saprobe fungi (Coriolopsis rigida; Phanerochaete chrysosporium; Trametes versicolor; Trichoderma harzianum and Penicillium chrysogenum). Our results showed a significant ""like"" AM root colonization (25-46%), highlighting the treatment co-inoculated with G. rosea + P chrysosporium or C. rigida; G. intraradices + C. rigida; G. viscosum + P chrysosporium, but this root colonization was morphologically atypical, and dominated by interstitial hyphae, without develop of other typical AM structures. Furthermore, significant increase in the shoot and root growth of the plantlets inoculated with G. viscosum + P chrysosporium, and G. intraradices + C. rigida were observed. On the other hand, G. claroideum + T versicolor showed the high increase in the dehydrogenase enzyme activity, while inoculation with G. claroideum alone showed the greatest beta-glucosidase activity. These results suggest that the interaction of AM symbionts together with saprobe fungi could be a biological alternative to promote the growth of micro-propagated blueberry plantlets in their early growth stages.","Arriagada, C; Manquel, D; Cornejo, P; Soto, J; Sampedro, I; Ocampo, J",JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT NUTRITION,2012,10.4067/S0718-95162012000200008,0.996036870268745,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999752019125597,2.4798087440317e-4,0.999999307498361,6.92501638588361e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12253,DHRS2-induced SPHK1 downregulation contributes to the cell growth inhibition by Trichothecin in colorectal carcinoma,"Background: Deregulation of lipid metabolism is one of the most prominent metabolic features in cancer. The activation of sphingolipid metabolic pathways affects the proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, chemoresistance, and immune escape of tumors, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Dehydrogenase/reductase member 2 (DHRS2), which belongs to the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, has been reported to participate in the regulation of lipid metabolism and impact on cancer progression. Trichothecin (TCN) is a sesquiterpenoid metabolite originating from an endophytic fungus of the herbal plant Maytenus hookeri Loes. Studies have shown that TCN exerts a broad-spectrum antitumor activity. Methods: We evaluated the proliferative ability of CRC cells by CCK8 and colony formation assays. A metabolite profiling using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was adopted to identify the proximal metabolite changes linked to DHRS2 overexpression. RNA stability assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) experiments were applied to determine the post-transcriptional regulation of SPHK1 expression by DHRS2. We used flow cytometry to detect changes in cell cycle and cell apoptosis of CRC cells in the absence or presence of TCN. Results: We demonstrate that DHRS2 hampers the sphingosine kinases 1 (SPHK1)/sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) metabolic pathway to inhibit CRC cell growth. DHRS2 directly binds to SPHK1 mRNA to accelerate its degradation in a post-transcriptionally regulatory manner. Moreover, we illustrate that SPHK1 downregulation induced by DHRS2 contributes to TCN-induced growth inhibition of CRC. Conclusions: The present study provides a mechanistic connection among metabolic enzymes, metabolites, and the malignant progression of CRC. Moreover, TCN could be developed as a potential pharmacological tool against CRC by the induction of DHRS2 and targeting SPHK1/S1P metabolic pathway.","Liu, HW; Li, X; Liu, WB; Zhang, CH; Zhang, SZ; Zhou, XR; Bode, AM; Luo, XJ",BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR CELL RESEARCH,2024,10.1016/j.bbamcr.2024.119846,0.712405077589006,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993370144077777,0.00662985592222312,0.999991612915432,8.38708456751824e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

In this study, two trichothecene toxins, namely, a novel cytotoxic epiroridin acid and a known trichothecene, mytoxin B, were isolated from the endophytic fungus Myrothecium roridum derived from the medicinal plant Pogostemon cablin. The two trichothecene mytoxins were confirmed to induce the apoptosis of HepG-2 cells by cytomorphology inspection, DNA-fragmentation detection, and flow cytometry assay. The cytotoxic mechanisms of the two mycotoxins were investigated by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, western blot, and detection of mitochondrial membrane potential. The results showed that the two trichothecene mycotoxins induced the apoptosis of cancer cell HepG-2 via activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, up-regulation of bax gene expression, down-regulation of bcl-2 gene expression, and disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential of the HepG-2 cell.

18977,Harnessing chickpea bacterial endophytes for improved plant health and fitness.,"Endophytic bacteria live asymptomatically inside the tissues of host plants without inflicting any damage. Endophytes can confer several beneficial traits to plants, which can contribute to their growth, development, and overall health. They have been found to stimulate plant growth by enhancing nutrient uptake and availability. They can produce plant growth-promoting substances such as auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins, which regulate various aspects of plant growth and development. Endophytes can also improve root system architecture, leading to increased nutrient and water absorption. Some endophytes possess the ability to solubilize nutrients, such as phosphorus and potassium, making them more available for plant uptake, and fixing atmospheric nitrogen. Chickpea (Cicer arietinum) is a major legume crop that has mutualistic interactions with endophytes. These endophytes can benefit the chickpea plant in various ways, including higher growth, improved nutrient uptake, increased tolerance to abiotic and biotic stressors, and disease suppression. They can produce enzymes and metabolites that scavenge harmful reactive oxygen species, thus reducing oxidative stress. Moreover, several studies reported that endophytes produce antimicrobial compounds, lytic enzymes, and volatile organic compounds that inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens and trigger systemic defense responses in plants, leading to increased resistance against a broad range of pathogens. They can activate plant defense pathways, including the production of defense-related enzymes, phytoalexins, and pathogenesis-related proteins, thereby providing long-lasting protection. It is important to note that the diversity and function of chickpea-associated endophytes can vary depending on factors such as variety, geographical location, and environmental conditions. The mechanisms behind the plant-beneficial interactions are still being intensively explored. In this review, new biotechnologies in agricultural production and ecosystem stability were presented. Thus, harnessing chickpea endophytes could be exploited in developing drought-resistant cultivars that can maintain productivity in arid and semi-arid environments, crucial for meeting the global demand for chickpeas.",Abdullaeva Y; Mardonova G; Eshboev F; Cardinale M; Egamberdieva D,AIMS microbiology,2024,10.3934/microbiol.2024024,0.971081067814797,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.958773168356136,0.0412268316438639,0.999980446348488,1.955365151185e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16508,First Report of Alternaria alternata Causing Leaf Spot on English Walnut.,"A foliar disease of English walnut (Juglans regia L.) was observed in 1998 in an orchard in northern Italy. Symptoms consisted of circular, necrotic spots bordered with concentric zones of darker tissue. Average lesion diameter was 20 mm, although lesions could extend to half of the leaflet lamina. A fungus identified as Alternaria alternata (Fr.:Fr.) Keissl. (1) was observed on the necrotic tissue and was consistently isolated from the margins of the necrosis. Conidia from leaves were brown, ellipsoid to ovoid (primary conidia 28 to 60 × 8 to 15 μm; secondary conidia 10 to 30 × 7 to 13 μm), with walls often ornamented, 1 to 6 transversely septate and 0 to 3 longitudinally septate. For pathogenicity tests, three isolates were grown on potato dextrose agar for 2 weeks. Inoculations were performed on detached, surface-sterilized, healthy J. regia leaflets. Four drops (5 μl each) of a sterile water suspension of 1 × 105 conidia per ml were placed on each leaflet; three leaves per isolate were used. Leaves were incubated in a moist chamber. After 10 days, leaf spots similar to the original symptoms developed on all the inoculated points for all three isolates, and the pathogen was reisolated. Control leaflets inoculated with sterile, distilled water remained symptomless. The experiment was performed three times and the results were similar.

2276,Symbiotic interactions as drivers of trade-offs in plants: effects of fungal endophytes on tall fescue,"Studying the controls on biomass allocation trade-offs in plants are important since they affect harvestable product yields and are critical to understanding symbiotic interactions. Epichloae fungal endophytes associate with cool-season grasses, growing systemically within the plant inter-cellular spaces and are transmitted through seeds. We explore the endophytes influence on the relationship between the plant reproductive and vegetative aboveground biomass (reproductive effort: RE) and on the trade-off between two components of the reproductive biomass, number and weight of panicles (RPN), using tall fescue as a model system. Naturally endophyte-colonized, manipulatively endophyte-free, and naturally endophyte-free plants from Northern European wild-populations together with the cultivar Kentucky-31 were grown under different environmental conditions (nutrients x water). The endophyte had an effect on the RPN (E+: 6.19, ME-: 4.68 and E-: 4.40) which indicates how reproductive biomass is partitioned into number and mass of panicles, but not on RE (a parts per thousand 0.06). As expected, wild plants showed higher reproductive effort (a parts per thousand 0.06) compared to the cultivar KY-31 (0.05), irrespective of endophyte presence. Endophyte-colonized plants had lighter panicles than endophyte-free plants, a pattern that was clear among low-yielding plants. Similarly, the trade-off between RPN and RE was higher for endophyte-colonized plants. This was again evident among plants with low RE indicating that colonized plants split the yield into either greater number of panicles and/or lighter panicles. The effect of vertically transmitted endophytes has earlier been studied as ratios (e.g. RE); however, our study shows that this approach may hide size-dependent endophyte effects on these relationships. Our study reveals that Neotyphodium endophyte affects trade-offs in tall fescue plants in a complex manner, and is influenced by a number of biological and abiotic factors.","Gundel, PE; Garibaldi, LA; Helander, M; Saikkonen, K",FUNGAL DIVERSITY,2013,10.1007/s13225-013-0224-y,0.85220404479396,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991750127164427,0.00824987283557304,0.999999206378345,7.93621654615606e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10133,Characterization of the Endophytic Mycobiome in Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) from a Single Location Using Illumina Sequencing,"Cowpea is an important crop for small-scale farmers in poor areas but is also being developed for commercial agriculture as a possible substitute for commercial legumes. Endophytic fungi are omnipresent and play crucial but diverse roles in plants. This study characterized the endophyte component of the cowpea mycobiome from leaves, main and crown stems and roots using Illumina MiSeq of the ITS2 region of the ribosomal operon. Ascomycetes exhibited the highest diversity, with Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTUs) assigned as Macrophomina, Cladosporium, Phoma, Fusarium and Cryptococcus, among the most dominant genera. Certain MOTUS showed preferential colonization patterns for above or below ground tissues. Several MOTU generic groups known to include phytopathogenic species were found, with relative abundances ranging from high to very low. Phylogenetic analyses of reads for some MOTUs showed that a level of identification could be obtained to species level. It also confirmed the absences of other species, including phytopathogens.

16767,Complete genome sequence of the metabolically versatile plant growth-promoting endophyte Variovorax paradoxus S110.,"Variovorax paradoxus is a microorganism of special interest due to its diverse metabolic capabilities, including the biodegradation of both biogenic compounds and anthropogenic contaminants. V. paradoxus also engages in mutually beneficial interactions with both bacteria and plants. The complete genome sequence of V. paradoxus S110 is composed of 6,754,997 bp with 6,279 predicted protein-coding sequences within two circular chromosomes. Genomic analysis has revealed multiple metabolic features for autotrophic and heterotrophic lifestyles. These metabolic diversities enable independent survival, as well as a symbiotic lifestyle. Consequently, S110 appears to have evolved into a superbly adaptable microorganism that is able to survive in ever-changing environmental conditions. Based on our findings, we suggest V. paradoxus S110 as a potential candidate for agrobiotechnological applications, such as biofertilizer and biopesticide. Because it has many associations with other biota, it is also suited to serve as an additional model system for studies of microbe-plant and microbe-microbe interactions.",Han JI; Choi HK; Lee SW; Orwin PM; Kim J; Laroe SL; Kim TG; O'Neil J; Leadbetter JR; Lee SY; Hur CG; Spain JC; Ovchinnikova G; Goodwin L; Han C,Journal of bacteriology,2011,10.1128/JB.00925-10,0.981553691592528,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.952637558563218,0.047362441436782,0.999999998377922,1.62207813847459e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5468,The Single-Seed Microbiota Reveals Rare Taxa-Associated Community Robustness,"Genetic and environmental cues affecting seed microbial communities have been investigated to assess the ecological characteristics of seed microbial communities. However, little is known concerning seed-to-seed microbial variations and ecological drivers at the single-seed level. We report rare taxa-associated heterogeneity and robustness of seed bacterial and fungal communities in individual seeds using 63 pooled and 70 single-seed samples from a single field-grown rice plant. Ordination analyses showed that seed-to-seed variation patterns could be clustered according to the originating panicle branch. Bacterial-fungal associations and in silico extinction experiments demonstrated that rare taxa contribute to the connectivity and robustness of the associations. Null modeling-based statistical analysis revealed that the distribution of rare taxa is mainly governed by dispersal limitation, whereas the distribution of prevalent taxa is mainly governed by homogeneous selection and ecological drift. Our findings provide an ecological framework for understanding the heterogeneity of seed microbial communities in a single plant; they will facilitate the development and application of seed microbiota or single microbe-based engineering strategies.","Kim, H; Kim, C; Lee, YH",PHYTOBIOMES JOURNAL,2023,10.1094/PBIOMES-10-22-0068-R,0.931121368153936,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999985109515659,1.48904843409202e-5,0.999999861220764,1.38779235658859e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19632,Attenuation of antibiotic resistance genes in livestock manure through vermicomposting via Protaetia brevitarsis and its fate in a soil-vegetable system.,"Scarab larvae (Protaetia brevitarsis) could transform large quantities of agricultural waste into compost, providing a promising bio-fertilizer for soil management. There is an urgent need to assess the risk of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in soil-vegetable system with application of compost derived from P. brevitarsis larvae. We conducted a pot experiment to compare the changes of ARGs in the soil and lettuce by adding four types of manure, livestock manure (chicken and swine manure) and the corresponding larval frass. Significantly low numbers of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were detected in both larval frass compared with the corresponding livestock manure. Pot experiment showed that the detected numbers of ARGs and MGEs in bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, and root endophytes were significantly lower in the frass-amended treatments than the raw manure-amended treatments. Furthermore, the relative abundance of ARGs and MGEs with application of chicken-frass was significant lower in rhizosphere soil and leaf endophyte. Using non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis, the patterns of soil ARGs and MGEs with chicken-frass application were more close to those from the bulk soil in the control. Structural equation models indicated that livestock manure addition was the main driver shaping soil ARGs with raw manure application, while MGEs were the key drivers in frass-amended treatments. These findings demonstrated that application of livestock manure vermicomposting via scarab larvae (P. brevitarsis) may be at low risk in spreading manure-borne ARGs through soil-plant system, providing an alternative technique for reducing ARGs in organic waste.",Zhao X; Shen JP; Shu CL; Jin SS; Di HJ; Zhang LM; He JZ,The Science of the total environment,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150781,0.516566493705958,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997847522001303,0.00215247799869653,0.99999996197746,3.80225397833556e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
18686,Plant tissue type and mineral contents shape endophytic bacterial communities in the Sisrè berry plant [Synsepalum dulcificum (Schumach & Thonn.) Daniell] in Benin.,"Diverse endophytic bacteria inhabit distinct tissues of a given species and are essential for plant growth and resilience to various stresses. Little information is available on bacterial endophytes associated with Synsepalum dulcificum, an opportunity fruit crop with high economic and medicinal values. Using Illumina sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, the diversity and structure of the endophytic bacterial community in the roots and leaves of S. dulcificum were determined, considering 29 accessions from three distinct phenotypes located either in home gardens or on farms in Benin. 2,468 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were recorded in the leaf and root endosphere of S. dulcificum, affiliated with 20 bacterial phyla, 49 classes, 125 orders, 217 families and 365 genera. Actinomycetota, Pseudomonadota and Chloroflexota were the most abundant phyla in the roots. In comparison, Pseudomonadota stood out as almost the unique phylum in the leaves, suggesting a significant decrease in diversity from roots to leaves. Significant correlations (p < 0.05) were observed between the relative abundance of the endophytic bacterial taxa and the mineral contents in the leaves, roots, and soil. While bacterial communities depended highly on accession, plant phenotype and habitat discriminated them in roots and leaves, respectively. Metagenome function prediction indicated that S. dulcificum harbors bacteria with the potential to metabolize carbohydrates and amino acids, as well as synthesize secondary metabolites and antimicrobial compounds beneficial for plant growth and adaptation to environmental stresses.

In this study, chrysin-producing fungal endophytes (A. alternata KT380662, C. capsici KT373967, and C. taiwanense PI-3 KX580307) were isolated from the leaves of Passiflora incarnata L. and characterised via morphology and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Thin layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography profiles of fungal extracts showed Rf values and retention times that closely match those of standard chrysin (ChR). Further, the production of fungal chrysin (FChR) was confirmed through UV-vis spectroscopy, FT-IR, LC-ESI-MS, and 1H1 NMR analysis. Among the isolated strains, A. alternata KT380662 was identified as having a high-level of ChR production, with rates measuring approximately 846 mg L-1. On the other hand, in vitro anticancer and radical scavenging studies proved that FChR has significant cytotoxic activity against human liver carcinoma cells (HepG2). These results clearly imply that the isolated A. alternata KT380662 could serve as an alternative source for the commercial production of ChR, which holds anticancer and radical scavenging activities, and the fungal-derived ChR can be used in chemotherapy or in prodrug development.","Seetharaman, P; Gnanasekar, S; Chandrasekaran, R; Chandrakasan, G; Kadarkarai, M; Sivaperumal, S",ANNALS OF MICROBIOLOGY,2017,10.1007/s13213-017-1263-5,0.848438308345866,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.956317577297186,0.0436824227028136,0.99999995140875,4.85912499126329e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

11148,Impact of Foliar Fungicide Application on the Culturable Fungal Endophyte Community of Soybean Seed in the Midwest United States,"The purpose of our study was to determine whether the application of quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) and pyrazole-carboxamide fungicides as a tank mix would impact the endophyte community of soybean seed. Field trials during 2018 in Iowa, South Dakota, and Wisconsin, U.S.A., investigated the impact of a single combination fungicide spray at early pod set in soybeans. The composition of culturable endophytic fungi in mature soybean seed was assessed on three cultivars per state, with maturity groups (MGs) ranging from 1.1 to 4.7. An unusually wet 2018 season delayed harvest, which led to a high level of fungal growth in grain. The survey included 1,080 asymptomatic seeds that were disinfested and individually placed on 5-cm-diameter Petri plates of acidified water agar. The survey yielded 721 fungal isolates belonging to 24 putative species in seven genera; taxa were grouped into genera based on a combination of morphological and molecular evidence. The dominant genera encountered in the survey were Alternaria, Diaporthe, and Fusarium. The study showed that the fungicide treatment reduced the incidence of Fusarium in Wisconsin seed, increased the incidence of Diaporthe in seed from all states, and had no impact on the incidence of Alternaria. This is one of the first attempts to characterize the diversity of seed endophytes in soybean and the first to characterize the impacts of fungicide spraying on these endophyte communities across three states. Our study provides evidence that the impact of a fungicide spray on soybean seed endophyte communities may be influenced by site, weather, and cultivar maturity group.","Batzer, JC; Shirazi, A; Lawson, M; Mathew, FM; Sureshbabu, BM; Smith, DL; Mueller, DS",PLANT DISEASE,2024,10.1094/PDIS-06-23-1122-RE,0.984303630896907,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999887989259775,1.1201074022476e-4,0.999999999792416,2.07584172073894e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Lipopeptides in cultures of Blu-v2 were determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and its antifungal activities were verified. However, the lipopeptide preparation did not show toxicity to larvae of Fall armyworms. In a greenhouse experiment, Blu-v2 was inoculated into small plantlets of hosta (cultivar ` Rainforest Sunrise'). The leaves of plants with bacteria (endophyte-infected = E+) and without bacteria (endophyte-free = E-) were used in seven-day feeding experiments employing fourth-instar larvae of Fall armyworms. We found that there was a significant decrease in the weights of larvae fed with E+ compared to E-plants; and the mortality rate of larvae fed with E- leaves was lower (3.33%) compared to that of larvae fed with E+ leaves (30%).

However, in most cases, the molecular mechanisms responsible for growth promotion are not known. Such research could benefit by the adoption of a grass model species that showed a positive response to bacterial inoculation and was amenable to genetic and molecular research methods. In this work we inoculated different genotypes of the model grass Brachypodium distachyon with two, well-characterized PGPR bacteria, Azospirillum brasilense and Herbaspirillum seropedicae, and evaluated the growth response. Plants were grown in soil under no nitrogen or with low nitrogen (i.e., 0.5 mM KNO3). A variety of growth parameters (e.g., shoot height, root length, number of lateral roots, fresh and dry weight) were measured 35 days after inoculation. The data indicate that plant genotype plays a very important role in determining the plant response to PGPR inoculation. A positive growth response was observed with only four genotypes grown under no nitrogen and three genotypes tested under low nitrogen. However, in contrast, relatively good root colonization was seen with most genotypes, as measured by drop plate counting and direct, microscopic examination of roots.

11654,In vitro cytotoxicity and secondary metabolites of Talaromyces wortmannii isolated from Arundo donax L.: Identification of a new phytoceramide,"Cancer remains a major global health threat, with breast, liver, and lung cancers showing particularly high incidence and mortality rates. Plant endophytes offer a unique resource for drug discovery. They produce bioactive compounds that may even surpass those of their host plants, providing a sustainable resource for new drugs. Herein, the in vitro cytotoxicity and secondary metabolites of the extract of white bean culture (EWBC) of the fungal endophyte, Talaromyces wortmannii isolated from Arundo donax L., a common reed grass were investigated. This led to the identification of a novel phytoceramide, namely talaroceramide (1), alongside other known structures, including stigmasterol (2), stigmasterol glucoside (5), thymine (3), and uracil (4). The EWBC extract exhibited cytotoxic effects on MCF7, HepG2, and A549 cancer cell lines, with IC50 values of 54.57, 57.12, and 84.33 mu g/mL, respectively. The EWBC extract demonstrated favorable selectivity indices ranging from 1.4 to 2.1 against the normal lung cell line (WI38), indicating selective cytotoxicity toward cancer cells over normal cells. The cytotoxicity observed, combined with the acceptable selectivity indices suggested the endophyte, T. wortmannii as a potential source for cytotoxic compounds. A docking study against Bcl-2 as a potential target for the discovery of anticancer drugs revealed that the new ceramide (1) showed the greatest binding affinity (-8.7894 kcal.mol-1) and the best binding interactions amongst the identified compounds.

However, triadimefon could lead to severe environmental pollution, and even threatens human health. To eliminate triadimefon residues, a triadimefon-degrading bacterial strain TY18 was isolated from a long-term polluted site and was identified as Enterobacter hormaechei. Strain TY18 could grow well in a carbon salt medium with triadimefon as the sole nitrogen source, and could efficiently degrade triadimefon. Under triadimefon stress, a total of 430 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 197 up-regulated and 233 down-regulated DEGs, were identified in strain TY18 using transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq). Functional classification and enrichment analysis revealed that these DEGs were mainly related to amino acid transport and metabolism, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, small molecule and pyrimidine metabolism. Interestingly, the DEGs encoding monooxygenase and hydrolase activity acting on carbon-nitrogen were highly up-regulated, might be mainly responsible for the metabolism in triadimefon.

18611,"Pantoea agglomerans: a mysterious bacterium of evil and good. Part II--Deleterious effects: Dust-borne endotoxins and allergens--focus on grain dust, other agricultural dusts and wood dust.","Pantoea agglomerans, a Gram-negative bacterium developing in a variety of plants as epiphyte or endophyte is particularly common in grain and grain dust, and has been identified by an interdisciplinary group from Lublin, eastern Poland, as a causative agent of work-related diseases associated with exposure to grain dust and other agricultural dusts. The concentration of P. agglomerans in grain as well as in the settled grain and flour dust was found to be high, ranging from 10(4)-10(8) CFU/g, while in the air polluted with grain or flour dust it ranged from 10(3)-10(5) CFU/m(3) and formed 73.2-96% of the total airborne Gram-negative bacteria. The concentration of P. agglomerans was also relatively high in the air of the facilities processing herbs and other plant materials, while it was lower in animal farms and in wood processing facilities. Pantoea agglomerans produces a biologically-potent endotoxin (cell wall lipopolysaccharide, LPS). The significant part of this endotoxin occurs in dusts in the form of virus-sized globular nanoparticles measuring 10-50 nm that could be described as the 'endotoxin super-macromolecules'. A highly significant relationship was found (R=0.804, P=0.000927) between the concentration of the viable P. agglomerans in the air of various agricultural and wood industry settings and the concentration of bacterial endotoxin in the air, as assessed by the Limulus test. Although this result may be interfered by the presence of endotoxin produced by other Gram-negative species, it unequivocally suggests the primary role of the P. agglomerans endotoxin as an adverse agent in the agricultural working environment, causing toxic pneumonitis (ODTS). Numerous experiments by the inhalation exposure of animals to various extracts of P. agglomerans strains isolated from grain dust, including endotoxin isolated with trichloroacetic acid (LPS-TCA), endotoxin nanoparticles isolated in sucrose gradient (VECN), and mixture of proteins and endotoxin obtained by extraction of bacterial mass in saline (CA-S), showed the ability of these extracts to evoke inflammatory and fibrotic changes in the lungs, to stimulate alveolar macrophages to produce superoxide anion (O2(-)), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and chemotactic factors for other macrophages and neutrophils, and to increase the pulmonary concentrations of toll-like receptors and chemokines. The most potent properties showed the CA-S which may be attributed to the allergenic properties of P. agglomerans proteins enhanced by the presence of the autologous endotoxin. The results of these experiments are in accord with the clinical studies which revealed a high reactivity of the agricultural and grain industry workers to allergenic extracts of P. agglomerans, and the presence in these populations of hypersensitivity pneumonitis and asthma cases caused by this bacterium. P. agglomerans has been also identified as a potential causative agent of allergic dermatitis in farmers and of allergic pulmonary disorders in cattle. In conclusion, similar to the cotton industry, also in the grain industry and in agriculture, Pantoea agglomerans should be regarded as one of the major causative agents of work-related diseases, caused by the adverse effects of protein allergens and endotoxin produced by this bacterium.",Dutkiewicz J; Mackiewicz B; Lemieszek MK; Golec M; Skórska C; Góra-Florek A; Milanowski J,Annals of agricultural and environmental medicine : AAEM,2016,10.5604/12321966.1196848,0.947117290967702,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.681849677601618,0.318150322398382,0.999915815004474,8.41849955257601e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

5311,Deciphering common bean (Phaseolus Vulgaris L.) microbiome assemblages reveal mechanistic insights into host-pathogen-microbiome interactions,"Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the primary source of proteins and nutrients in most households in subSaharan Africa. However, production of this crop is constrained by several biotic factors. While research on common bean plant-pathogen interactions has predominantly focused on binary relationships, the diversity of microbes naturally inhabiting plant tissues and their interactions has often been overlooked. Recent findings, however, show that these resident microbes actively contribute to plant defense mechanisms, rather than merely acting as passive bystanders. This study aimed to document and explore potential interactions within the common bean microbiome assemblages through field investigations in selected locations across the western regions of Kenya. Common bean leaf samples were collected from farmer's fields along motorable roads 3-5 km apart. Shotgun metagenomic analysis identified a diverse range of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, yeast, phytoplasmas, viruses, and bacteriophages, across multiple taxonomic levels-spanning 4 Kingdoms, 136 Phyla, 168 Classes, 360 Orders, 792 Families, 2039 Genera, and 6130 Species-both epiphytic and endophytic, and pathogenic or non-pathogenic. Pseudomonadota consistently showed the highest taxonomic annotation for antimicrobial-resistant organisms, highlighting its central role in resistance across the studied area. The sequences obtained were mapped to the EggNOG, CAZy, and KEGG databases to explore, assign, and predict gene functions. The EggNOG database emphasized the importance of ""Replication, recombination, and repair"" processes in maintaining genomic stability, along with amino acid transport, energy production, and metabolism. CAZy analysis revealed a significant presence of glycosyltransferases, particularly from GT1 and GT32 families, and noted the role of enzymes like Glycoside Hydrolases in plant defense against pathogens. KEGG pathway analysis underscored the central role of metabolic processes such as energy metabolism, translation, and carbohydrate metabolism. Key pathways linked to plant defense and resilience, including 2-oxocarboxylic acid metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, were identified. These findings underscore the role of metabolic and enzymatic processes in strengthening plant defenses and stress tolerance while laying the groundwork for multidisciplinary research to advance sustainable agriculture and food safety.","Osogo, AK; Muyekho, F; Were, H; Okoth, P",GENOMICS,2025,10.1016/j.ygeno.2025.111064,0.995590791600613,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.883958069159994,0.116041930840006,0.9999540452788,4.59547212001699e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
17268,First Report of Phytophthora syringae on Cedrus libani in Turkey.,"Cedrus libani, commonly known as Lebanon cedar, is one of the most important coniferous tree species in Turkey. Its main distribution is in the Taurus Mountains in the Mediterranean Region. The total area of pure Taurus cedar forest covers 109,440 ha in Turkey, all located in the southwestern regions of the country. Due to its drought resistance, Taurus cedar has been commonly used for afforestations in these semi-arid areas (1). In September 2011, during surveys for Phytophthora spp. in forest nurseries in Adapazari and İzmir in eastern Turkey, initial symptoms such as death of fine roots, yellowing, and wilting of Taurus cedar seedlings were observed. Soil samples were collected from 10 symptomatic C. libani seedlings and isolation tests for Phytophthora species were carried out using leaflets from young Quercus suber, Azalea sp., and Rhodendron sp. saplings as baits floated over flooded soil. Necrotic baits were blotted dry, cut into small pieces, and placed on selective PARPNH carrot agar. Out growing colonies were subcultured on carrot agar and kept at 12°C for morphological and molecular identifications (2). In total, six Pythiaceous isolates were obtained from the C. libani soil samples. The isolates were investigated using a light microscope and grouped according to their morphological characteristics (3). DNA was extracted from two representative isolates using Qiagen DNeasy Plant Mini Kit following the manufacturer's instructions. PCR amplifications and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA and the β-tubulin gene were performed using ITS1 and ITS4 and Tub1 and Tub2 primer sets (4). Sequencing of the PCR products in both directions was conducted by IonTek Inc. (Istanbul, Turkey) in an ABI PRISM automated sequencer. The obtained sequences were compared with those in the GenBank and Phytophthora database using BLAST search. On the basis of morphological features and molecular analyses, the two isolates were identified as Phytophthora syringae. Morphological characteristics on carrot agar were identical with the description of P. syringae (2). At 20°C, colonies reached 7 cm in diameter after 1 week. Sporangia were semipapillate to non-papillate, ovoid, with average length of 59 μm (SD ± 2.8) (range 58 to 70 μm). Oogonia were 38 μm (SD ± 5.4) in diameter (range 30 to 47 μm) with paragynous antheridia. The morphological identification was confirmed by sequence comparison at GenBank with 99% homology for both ITS and β-tubulin. The ITS sequences of the two isolates were deposited in GenBank with the accession nos. KF430614 and KF944377. Under-bark inoculation tests with mycelia plugs were conducted with both isolates of P. syringae at 18°C in a growth chamber on a total of six 1-year-old shoots cut from two C. libani trees. Lesions with an average length of 19 mm (SD ± 6) developed after 10 days. P. syringae was consistently re-isolated from the margins of necrotic tissues. Control shoots remained symptomless. To our knowledge, this is the first report of damage caused by P. syringae on C. libani seedlings in forest nursery in Turkey. References: (1) T. Çalışkan.

Our data showed that the most crucial traits affected by endophyte inoculation under salt stress were chlorophyll concentration, leaf development, water storage, root development, and biomass accumulation. Thus, the influence of endophytes was species specific. K. marisflavi CSE9 promoted the growth of all tested plant species and could be considered a universal PGPEs for many plant genotypes cultivated under saline conditions (e.g., increasing of fresh weight compared to the non-inoculated control variant of barley, lettuce, and sunflower in the ranges 11.4-246.8, 118.9-201.2, and 16.4-77.7%, respectively). P. stutzeri ISE12 stimulated growth and mitigated salinity stress only in the case of barley. Bioaugmentation of crops with halotolerant bacterial strains can alleviate salt stress and promote plant growth; however, the selection of compatible strains and the verification of universal plant stress indicators are the key factors.",Szymańska S; Lis MI; Piernik A; Hrynkiewicz K,Frontiers in microbiology,2022,10.3389/fmicb.2022.788893,0.968121487858412,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.830471933717098,0.169528066282902,0.998027841311957,0.00197215868804335,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
11337,"Ecological interactions in conifers (Agathoxylon and Protocupressinoxylon) from the Punta del Barco Formation (Baquero Group, upper Aptian), Patagonia, Argentina","The Punta del Barco Formation is the uppermost unit of the upper Aptian continental deposits of the Baquer = o Group, cropping out in Argentinian Patagonia. These units have yielded highly diverse and abundant megafloras that contain some of the oldest evidence of angiosperms in the region. The parent vegetation grew in lacustrine to fluvial environments, with progressively increased volcanic activity that certainly affected the dynamics of the palaeocommunities. In this work, new fossil woods from the Punta del Barco Formation are described and referred to Agathoxylon Hartig 1848 and Protocupressinoxylon Eckhold 1923, probably allied to Araucariaceae and Cheirolepidiaceae respectively, and constituting two of the three conifer families already reported from the unit. Rootlets traversing some of the studied specimens are interpreted as evidence of seedlings growing in fragments of wood acting as nurse-logs, an ecological strategy recorded at least since the late Palaeozoic, in this particular case probably reflecting a response to the volcanic activity recorded in the unit. Two styles of fungal activity are identified in the fossil woods: Group 1 comprises microsclerotia and associate hyphae, found in close association with rootlets, interpreted as dark septate endophytes; and Group 2, consisting of hyphae traversing wood tracheids, along with evidence of degraded wood, interpreted as wood decay fungal activity.

6181,Antiproliferative Activity and Characterization of Metabolites of Aspergillus nidulans: An Endophytic Fungus from Nyctanthes arbor-tristis Linn. Against Three Human Cancer Cell Lines,"Background: Endophytic fungi are receiving attention as sources of structurally novel bioactive secondary metabolites towards drug discovery from natural products. This study reports the isolation and characterization of secondary metabolites from an endophytic fungus Aspergillus nidulans, associated with Nyctanthes arbor-tristis Linn., a plant which has a traditional use to cure many ailments including cancer. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of the metabolites of A. nidulans from N. arbor-iristis on three human cancer cell lines, lung (NCI-H460), breast (MCF-7) and uterine cervix (HeLa), and carry out their characterization. Methods: The extracts of the endophytic fungus cultured on potato dextrose agar were subjected to various chromatographic techniques. Structures of pure compounds were determined using spectroscopic techniques. The non-polar constituents were analyzed by GC-MS. Antiproliferative activity was determined by sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. Results: The extracts and fractions showed moderate to good growth inhibition of the aforementioned human cancer cell lines. The broth extract was most potent (IC50 = 10 +/- 3.1 mu g/mL and LC50 = 95 +/- 3.9) against HeLa whereas petroleum ether insoluble fraction of mycelium was most active against NCI-H460 and MCF-7 (IC50 = 10 +/- 2.1 mu g/mL and 18 +/- 3.1 mu g/mL respectively). GC-MS led to identify 12 compounds in mycelium and 19 compounds in broth. Four pure compounds were isolated and characterized one compound 5, 10-dihydrophenazine-1-carboxylic acid (1) from broth and three 1-hydroxy-3-methylxanthone (2), ergosterol (3) and sterigmatocystin (4) from mycelium. 1 has not been reported earlier as a plant/fungal metabolite while 2-4 are new from this source. Sterigmatocystin exhibited growth inhibitory effect (IC50 = 50 +/- 2.5 mu M/mL) against only MCF-7 cell line whereas other compounds had IC50 > 100. Conclusions: In this paper, the cytotoxicity of mycelium and broth constituents of endophytic fungus Aspergillus nidulans from Nyctanthes arbor-tristis is reported for the first time. The study shows that fungus Aspergillus nidulans from Nyctanthes arbor-trisils is capable of producing biologically active natural compounds and provides a scientific rationale for further chemical investigations of endophyte-producing natural products.","Sana, T; Siddiqui, BS; Shahzad, S; Farooq, AD; Siddiqui, F; Sattar, S; Begum, S",MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY,2019,10.2174/1573406414666180828124252,0.850810426888493,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.986156463965172,0.0138435360348284,0.999999999997661,2.33901786828028e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

19576,Endophytic Microbiota of Rice and Their Collective Impact on Host Fitness.,"Endophytic microbiota mainly includes positive modulator of plant growth, productivity, stress tolerance and ability to control the phytopathogens. Rice endophytes colonize in different parts like roots, shoots, leaves, seeds, flowers, ovules, etc. The diversity and colonization of endophytes depend on several factors like host specificity, environment specificity, chemotaxis, motility, etc. A mutualistic relationship between rice plant and their endophytes improves the host health. Several crucial activities of rice plants are influenced by the presence of endophytes as they endorse plant growth by producing different phytohormones, solubilized minerals, or mitigating various environmental adverse conditions. Endophytes also protect rice plants from various phytopathogen by the production of secondary metabolites, lytic enzymes, antibiotics and induced systemic acquired resistance. Furthermore, the endophytes from rice and major crops are recently been shown useful in environmental waste management and also for the synthesis of green nanoparticles. This study highlights the beneficial interaction between rice plants and their endophytic microbiota with special emphasis on highlighting their application for sustainable agricultural and environmental practices in order to enhance the agro-economy in an eco-friendly manner.",Jana SK; Islam MM; Mandal S,Current microbiology,2022,10.1007/s00284-021-02737-w,0.966316367300986,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990495302644876,0.0095046973551237,0.99999973060247,2.69397530283655e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

18788,Sludge amended soil induced multidrug and heavy metal resistance in endophytic Exiguobacterium sp. E21L: genomics evidences.,"The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in agro-environments poses serious risks to public health and ecological balance. In this study, Exiguobacterium sp. E21L, an endophytic strain, was isolated from carrot leaves cultivated in soil amended with sewage treatment plant-derived sludge. The strain exhibited resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics, including beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and macrolides, with a high Multi-Antibiotic Resistance Index of 0.88. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a genome of 3.06 Mb, encoding 3894 protein-coding genes, including antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) such as blaNDM, ermF, tetW, and sul1, along with heavy metal resistance genes (HMRGs) like czcD, copB, and nikA. Genomic islands carrying ARGs and stress-related genes suggested potential horizontal gene transfer. The strain demonstrated robust biofilm formation, high cell hydrophobicity (> 80%), and significant auto-aggregation (90% at 48 h), correlating with genes associated with motility, quorum sensing, and stress adaptation. Notably, phenotypic assays confirmed survival under simulated gastrointestinal conditions, emphasizing its resilience in host-associated environments. Comparative genomics positioned Exiguobacterium sp. E21L near Exiguobacterium chiriqhucha RW-2, with a core genome of 2716 conserved genes. Functional annotations revealed genes involved in xenobiotic degradation, multidrug efflux pumps, and ABC-type transporters, indicating versatile resistance mechanisms and metabolic capabilities. The presence of ARGs, HMRGs, and MGEs (mobile genetic elements) highlights the potential role of Exiguobacterium sp. E21L as a reservoir for resistance determinants in agricultural ecosystems.

20461,TRANSLOCATION AND METABOLISM OF PROCYMIDONE IN CUCUMBER AND BEAN-PLANTS,"Translocation and metabolism of a systemic fungicide procymidone [Sumilex, N-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-1,2-dimethylcyclopropane-1,2-dicarboximide] radiolabeled at the carbonyl C were examined in cucumber and bean plants under laboratory conditions. The fungicide disappeared from the plants with a half-life of 20 days, after foliar application at a rate of 250 .mu.g/leaf. Procymidone was metabolized in plants via hydroxylation at the methyl group or the 4-position of phenyl group, or hydrolysis at the cyclic imide linkage. Very little of radioactivity translocated to other parts of the plants including edible portions. When the fungicide was applied to the surface of a cucumber fruit, .apprx. 24% of the applied radioactivity penetrated into the fruit in a day. There was no significant increase of radioactivity in the fruit thereafter. When bean plant seedlings were cultivated for 42 days in Kodaira light clay and Takarazuka loamy sand soils treated with 10 ppm of 14C-procymidone, shoots, and pods and seeds contained 12.3-15.3 ppm and 0.42-0.66 ppm of 14C, respectively.

13039,Biocontrol of verticillium wilt and colonization of cotton plants by an endophytic bacterial isolate,"Aims: To explore biocontrol potential of 39 DAEB isolates (doubly antagonistic towards both Verticillium dahliae Kleb and Fusarium oxysporum) against verticillium wilt of cotton and to elucidate colonization and category characteristics of an endophytic bacterium with significant biocontrol activity. Methods and Results: Thirty-nine antagonistic endophytic bacteria strains were tested for their ability to control verticillium wilt in cotton plants caused by a defoliating pathotype of V. dahliae 107 in cotton under controlled conditions. The biocontrol trial revealed that an endophytic bacterium, designated HA02, showed a significant biocontrol activity to V. dahliae 107. After cotton seedlings were inoculated with a gfp gene-tagged HA02 (HA02-gfp), HA02-gfp populations were higher in the root than in the stem; in addition, the HA02-gfp was distributed in the maturation zone of cotton root. Furthermore, HA02-gfp also colonized seedlings of maize, rape and soybean after the bacteria inoculation. Phylogenetic trees based on 16S rDNA sequences combined with morphological, physiological and identification showed that the bacterium belongs to the Enterobacter genus. Conclusions: Our results showed that only 1 of 39 DAEB isolates demonstrated more efficient biocontrol potential towards V. dahliae 107 in greenhouse and field trials. HA02-gfp mainly colonized cotton in roots. In addition, we quantitatively observed HA02 colonization in other hosts. HA02 belongs to the Enterobacter genus. Significance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study on biocontrol to defoliating pathotype of V. dahliae Kleb by endophytic bacteria. The HA02 showed effective biocontrol to V. dahliae 107 in greenhouse and field trials. Furthermore, we assessed the quantitative and qualitative colonization of HA02 in cotton seedlings.

5477,Highly Clonal Structure and Abundance of One Haplotype Characterise the Diplodia sapinea Populations in Europe and Western Asia,"Diplodia sapinea is a cosmopolitan endophyte and opportunistic pathogen having occurred on several conifer species in Europe for at least 200 years. In Europe, disease outbreaks have increased on several Pinus spp. in the last few decades. In this study, the genetic structure of the European and western Asian D. sapinea population were investigated using 13 microsatellite markers. In total, 425 isolates from 15 countries were analysed. A high clonal fraction and low genetic distance between most subpopulations was found. One single haplotype dominates the European population, being represented by 45.3% of all isolates and found in nearly all investigated countries. Three genetically distinct subpopulations were found: Central/North European, Italian and Georgian. The recently detected subpopulations of D. sapinea in northern Europe (Estonia) share several haplotypes with the German subpopulation. The northern European subpopulations (Latvia, Estonia and Finland) show relatively high genetic diversity compared to those in central Europe suggesting either that the fungus has existed in the North in an asymptomatic/endophytic mode for a long time or that it has spread recently by multiple introductions. Considerable genetic diversity was found even among isolates of a single tree as 16 isolates from a single tree resulted in lower clonal fraction index than most subpopulations in Europe, which might reflect cryptic sexual proliferation. According to currently published allelic patterns, D. sapinea most likely originates from North America or from some unsampled population in Asia or central America. In order to enable the detection of endophytic or latent infections of planting stock by D. sapinea, new species-specific PCR primers (DiSapi-F and Diplo-R) were designed. During the search for Diplodia isolates across the world for species specific primer development, we identified D. africana in California, USA, and in the Canary Islands, which are the first records of this species in North America and in Spain.","Adamson, K; Laas, M; Blumenstein, K; Busskamp, J; Langer, GJ; Klavina, D; Kaur, A; Maaten, T; Mullett, MS; Müller, MM; Ondrusková, E; Padari, A; Pilt, E; Riit, T; Solheim, H; Soonvald, L; Tedersoo, L; Terhonen, E; Drenkhan, R",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2021,10.3390/jof7080634,0.972874308234462,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999877967872834,1.2203212716597e-4,0.999998745938266,1.25406173423492e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

15087,Synergistic potential of nitrogen fertilization and endophytic microorganisms on initial growth of Sorghum bicolor; [Potencial sinérgico da adubação nitrogenada e micro-organismos endofíticos no crescimento inicial de Sorghum bicolor],"Endophytic microorganisms such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate fungi (DSF) may influence plant development according to soil microbial interaction and fertility. The purpose of the work was to evaluate the effect of nitrogen levels on the interaction of AMF and DSF on initial sorghum growth. The experimental design was completely randomized in a 4 x 4 factorial scheme, corresponding to sorghum cultivation in four treatments (Control - without inoculation of AMF and three mycorrhizal isolates: UFLA351 - Rhizoglomus clarum, UFLA372 - Claroideoglomus etunicatum, and UFLA401 - Acaulospora morrowiae) and four nitrogen levels (N): 0, 100, 300, and 600 mg Kg-1 of N. The sorghum seeds presented the filamentous fungi Rhizoctonia, Colletotrichum, Curvularia, Fusarium, Helminthosporium and Mucor; and the bacterium Bacillus subtillis, which may have interfered with plant growth. In the UFLA351 and UFLA372 treatments, the increase in nitrogen levels reduces the initial growth of sorghum, but does not influence the colonization rate of endophytic fungi DSE.

5921,Using the Microbiome Amplification Preference Tool (MAPT) to Reveal Medicago sativa-Associated Eukaryotic Microbes,"Although our understanding of the microbial diversity found within a given system expands as amplicon sequencing improves, technical aspects still drastically affect which members can be detected. Compared with prokaryotic members, the eukaryotic microorganisms associated with a host are understudied due to their underrepresentation in ribosomal databases, lower abundance compared with bacterial sequences, and higher ribosomal gene identity to their eukaryotic host. Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) blockers are often designed to reduce amplification of host DNA. Here we present a tool for PNA design called the Microbiome Amplification Preference Tool (MAPT). We examine the effectiveness of a PNA designed to block genomic Medicago sativa DNA (gPNA) compared with unrelated surrounding plants from the same location. We applied mitochondrial PNA and plastid PNA to block the majority of DNA from plant mitochondria and plastid 16S ribosomal RNA genes, as well as the novel gPNA. Until now, amplifying both eukaryotic and prokaryotic reads using 515F-Y and 926R has not been applied to a host. We investigate the efficacy of this gPNA using three approaches: (i) in silico prediction of blocking potential in MAPT, (ii) amplicon sequencing with and without the addition of PNAs, and (iii) comparison with cultured fungal representatives. When gPNA is added during amplicon library preparation, the diversity of unique eukaryotic amplicon sequence variants present in M. sativa increases. We provide a layered examination of the costs and benefits of using PNAs during sequencing. The application of MAPT enables scientists to design PNAs specifically to enable capturing greater diversity in their system.","Moccia, K; Papoulis, S; Willems, A; Marion, Z; Fordyce, JA; Lebeis, SL",PHYTOBIOMES JOURNAL,2020,10.1094/PBIOMES-02-20-0022-R,0.847033760207148,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999770591276115,2.2940872388488e-4,0.99999999999769,2.30959695812771e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

6373,Beneficial effects of endophytic fungi inoculation on tanshinones and phenolic compounds of Salvia abrotanoides,"Objective(s): Salvia abrotanoides is considered as a new source of tanshinone-producing plants in Iran. Symbiosis of endophytic fungi with their host plants is an effective tool to promote the growth and secondary metabolism of medicinal herbs. Therefore, using endophytic fungi as a biotic elicitor is a proper solution to increase the yield of plant products. Materials and Methods: In this study, some endophytic fungi were first isolated from the root of S. abrotanoides, then two of them (Penicillium canescens and Talaromyces sp.) were co-cultivated with the sterile seedling of S. abrotanoides in pot culture. After proving the colonization of these fungi in the root tissues by microscopic studies, their effects on the production of critical medicinal compounds such as tanshinones and phenolic acids were investigated in the vegetation stage (120 days). Results: Our results showed that the content of cryptotanshinone (Cry) and tanshinone IIA (T-IIA) in plants inoculated with P. canescens increased by 77.00% and 19.64%, respectively, compared with non-inoculated plants (control). The contents of mentioned compounds in plants inoculated with Talaromyces sp. increased by 50.00% and 23.00%, respectively. In this case, in plants inoculated with P. canescens, it was found that the level of caffeic acid, rosmarinic acid, and its PAL enzyme activity increased by 64.00%, 69.00%, and 50.00%, respectively, compared with the control. Conclusion: Endophytic fungi have specific modes of action and the ability to provide multiple benefits. Each of the two strains is a highly considerable microbial resource for the growth and accumulation of active compounds of S. abrotanoides.","Khorasani, FM; Ganjeali, A; Asili, J; Cheniany, M",IRANIAN JOURNAL OF BASIC MEDICAL SCIENCES,2023,10.22038/IJBMS.2023.67730.14828,0.869323094662009,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.97168815463466,0.0283118453653397,0.99999874698532,1.25301467968075e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2084,Endophyte-Mediated Resistance to Black Cutworm as a Function of Plant Cultivar and Endophyte Strain in Tall Fescue,"To improve Neotyphodium endophyte-mediated resistance to black cutworm Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel) (BCW), a series of experiments was conducted by using several different cultivars of tall fescue, Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.) Dumort. in combination with several different haplotypes of the endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum (Morgan-Jones & Gams) (plant cultivar X endophyte haplotype = plant line), each producing unique alkaloid profiles. BCW settling response, survival at 5 and 10 d, and larval biomass varied significantly among plant lines. In general, greater variation BCW performance was observed within a single plant cultivar infected with different endophyte haplotypes than among different plant cultivars infected with the same endophyte haplotype, but comparisons among the former were far more numerous. Although five endophyte-mediated alkaloids representing three alkaloid classes were quantified in the plants, the pyrrolizidine alkaloid N-acetyl norloline was consistently the single best predictor of BCW performance. BCW settling response, 5-d survival, and 10-d survival decreased as levels of the alkaloid N-acetyl norloline increased. The same three response variables also decreased with increasing levels of peramine, but increased with increasing levels of ergovaline. Minor variation in endophyte infection levels occurring among infected plant lines had no significant influence on BCW performance. Results indicate a potentially important role for N-acetyl norloline and peramine in providing resistance to black cutworm whereas ergovaline appears to be much less important. Therefore, endophyte haplotypes expressing high levels of N-acetyl norloline and peramine may be of particular importance for developing 'friendly' endophyte-enhanced turf and pasture grasses that resist challenging lepidopteran pests, although remaining safe for wildlife and grazing mammals.","Baldauf, MW; Mace, WJ; Richmond, DS",ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY,2011,10.1603/EN09227,0.984476722203732,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998943168221307,0.00105683177869266,0.999999997167198,2.8328016599132903e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
4334,Colonization effect of Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill. on tomato plant and Bemisia tabaci,"Whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) is an insect threatening tomato production in Egypt. This study investigated the impacts of the entomopathogenic fungi species, Beauveria bassiana, isolate against B. tabaci on tomato plants under natural conditions in two seasons (2023-2024). Conidial powder was directly applied to the soil. Fungus was added to the fertilization treatments (BF) and was compared with fertilization (CF) and control (C0). The findings indicated notable significant variations in the population densities of B. tabaci in comparison to the other groups in two seasons. This fungus can also be used as a growth enhancer besides being a biopesticide for tomato crops. Tomato leaf samples were collected in three growth phases: vegetative, flowering, and fruiting phases in addition to ripe tomato fruits. Collected leaves were dried and used to detect defense mechanisms through estimating phenolic compounds such as tannins and flavonoids and total protein content, while tomato fruits were used to estimate ascorbic acid level as a growth promotion indicator in the tested tomato plants. B. bassiana -treated plants showed a significant increase in total tannins compared to fertilization-treated plants and non-significant increase compared to control. While Total Protein Content (TPC) was significantly higher in fertilization-treated plants than in B. bassiana -treated plants and control it was only increased significantly in the bioagent treatment than in the control. For total flavonoids, a non-significant increase was detected in total flavonoids content in B. bassiana-treated plants than in fertilization- treated plants and controls. Beauveria bassiana -treated tomato fruits recorded the highest value of ascorbic acid content, which significantly increased than fertilization treatment and non-significantly increased compared to the control. Generally, the interaction between treatments and growth phases in total tannin content, total protein content, and total flavonoid content was not statistically significant, which means there is no behavior for B. bassiana treatment on the plant resistance mechanism during the different growth stages, and the highest level for each was recorded in the flowering phase compared to the vegetative and fruiting phases. Also, the findings indicated the highest yield was represented by adding B. bassiana to the soil. The obtained results from this study refer to the beneficial role of B. bassiana in systemic resistance induction stimulated by tannin content in the tested tomato plants against whitefly attacks.","Haron, EN; Hassan, DMA; El-Said, E; Zaid, NA; Deraz, SF; Serour, EA",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2025,10.1038/s41598-025-00562-w,0.997108637377133,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.937571603167496,0.0624283968325045,0.999998631697122,1.36830287778e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15604,"Biogenic titanium nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) from Tricoderma citrinoviride extract: synthesis, characterization and antibacterial activity against extremely drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa","Abstract: Green synthesis of nanoparticles has attracted significant attention as an alternative to chemical synthesis procedure. The bulk availability of plants, microbial biomass and the use of eco-friendly solvents has significantly reduced the cost in addition to the hazards associated with the chemical synthesis of the nanoparticle. In this study, we demonstrated the biosynthesis of titanium nanoparticles (TiO2NPs) with the extract of Trichoderma citrinoviridae as a reducing agent. The physicochemical properties of biogenic TiO2NPs were studied using FESEM, Zeta sizer, FTIR and XRD. The size (10–400 nm), morphology, crystallinity, zeta potential (29.5 mV), and polydispersity index (0.327) suggested that the biogenic TiO2NPs were polymorphic, crystalline and stable. FESEM revealed that the synthesized TiO2NPs were majorly irregular, and some interesting TiO2NPs structures, i.e., triangular, pentagonal, spherical and rod were also observed. The biogenic TiO2NPs showed excellent antibacterial activity (100 µg/mL) against planktonic cells of extremely drug-resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates. The TiO2NPs also had better antioxidant potential as compared to standard gallic acid. This study indicates the use of T. citrinoviridae for synthesizing biogenic TiO2NPs and their potential use against XDR bacteria.

10916,Serendipita indica Drives Sulfur-Related Microbiota in Enhancing Growth of Hyperaccumulator Sedum alfredii and Facilitating Soil Cadmium Remediation,"Endophytic fungus Serendipita indica can bolster plant growth and confer protection against various biotic and abiotic stresses. However, S. indica -reshaped rhizosphere microecology interactions and root-soil interface processes in situ at the submicrometer scale remain poorly understood. We combined amplicon sequencing and high-resolution nano X-ray fluorescence (nano-XRF) imaging of the root-soil interface to reveal cadmium (Cd) rhizosphere processes. S. indica can successfully colonize the roots of Sedum alfredii Hance, which induces a remarkable increase in shoot biomass by 211.32% and Cd accumulation by 235.72%. Nano-XRF images showed that S. indica colonization altered the Cd distribution in the rhizosphere and facilitated the proximity of more Cd and sulfur (S) to enter the roots and transport to the shoot. Furthermore, the rhizosphere-enriched microbiota demonstrated a more stable network structure after the S. indica inoculation. Keystone species were strongly associated with growth promotion and Cd absorption. For example, Comamonadaceae are closely related to the organic acid cycle and S bioavailability, which could facilitate Cd and S accumulation in plants. Meanwhile, Sphingomonadaceae could release auxin and boost plant biomass. In summary, we construct a mutualism system for beneficial fungi and hyperaccumulation plants, which facilitates high-efficient remediation of Cd-contaminated soils by restructuring the rhizosphere microbiota.","Qiao, YB; Lin, Z; Li, LX; Jiang, W; Ge, J; Chen, JZ; Lu, LL; Tian, SK",ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,2024,10.1021/acs.est.4c01418,0.881854972433413,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.9504926369029,0.0495073630971005,0.999999996812958,3.1870415195811603e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The severity of the symptoms caused by G. abietina, and the isolation frequency of endophytic (symptomless) G. abietina and the saprophytes, were measured 11 months after G. abietina inoculation. The isolation frequencies of the two Hormonema species increased significantly in the seedlings inoculated three times with saprophyte conidia. Irrigation treatments did not affect the saprophytes. The disease symptoms caused by G. abietina were positively correlated with tree density. Symptomless G. abietina was isolated most often from the seedlings that had received irrigation at pH 6. The isolation frequency was lowest in seedlings with acidic irrigation.

ED2, previously isolated from the medicinal herb Orthosiphon stamineus Benth. Interestingly, upon addition of aqueous host extract to the culture medium, the ethyl acetate extract prepared from fermentative broth exhibited moderate anti-candidal activity in a disc diffusion assay. The minimal inhibitory concentration of this extract was 62.5 mu g/ml and it only exhibited fungistatic activity against C. albicans. In the time-kill study, a 50% growth reduction of C. albicans was observed at 31.4 h for extract from the culture incorporating host extract. In the bioautography assay, only one single spot (Rf 0.59) developed from the extract exhibited anti-candidal activity. A spot with the a similar Rf was not detected for the crude extract from YES broth without host extract. This indicated that the terpenoid anti-candidal compound was only produced when the host extract was introduced into the medium. The study concluded that the incorporation of aqueous extract of the host plant into the culture medium significantly enhanced the anti-candidal activity of Phomopsis sp.

5725,Metabolite profiling and genomic properties of an endophytic Bacillus siamensis strain with anti-tumor activity isolated from medicinal plant Curcuma Wenyujin,"Plant endophytes produce a variety of secondary metabolites that have a wide range of biological effects. Curcuma wenyujin Y.H. Chen et C. Ling is a medicinal plant of the genus Curcuma in Zingiberaceae possessing anti-tumor effects. However, Bacillus siamensis isolated from C. wenyujin highly remains limited understanding. In this study, a novel B. siamensis named as WYJ-E14 strain from C. wenyujin was isolated. The CCK8 assay showed that the metabolites produced by WYJ-E14 strain significantly inhibited the growth of melanoma and glioma cells. Metabolomic analysis showed that the eight metabolites of the WYJ-E14 metabolites had anti-tumor cell growth activity, including desferrioxamine G1, surfactin, menaquinone-4, tracheloside, proscillaridin, microcolin J, stevioside, and demethoxycurcumin. Genomic sequencing displayed that the whole genome of WYJ-E14 contained a circular chromosome with a total length of 4,020,075 bp, and had no plasmid. Genome annotation identified 4008 putative protein-coding genes, 1 tRNA, and 27 rRNAs. The CDSs number assigned to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Gene Ontology, and Clusters of Orthologous Genes databases were 2145, 2764 and 3403, respectively. Biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) related to the synthesis of surfactin, difficidin, fengycin, bacillaene, macrolactin, butirosin A/butirosin B, bacillibactin and bacilysin were identified in the genome of WYJ-E14 by antiSMASH analysis. Most importantly, the genes involved in the biosynthesis of surfactin and menaquinone-4 metabolism were identified. In addition, WYJ-E14 genome also contained sequences that shared similarity with the genes encoding enzymes involved in the plant curcumin anabolism. The predicted ORFs encoded 120 secretory proteins. Comparative genome analysis showed that WYJ-E14 possessed collinear region among B. siamensis YB-1631 and B. velezensis W1.

5230,DEVELOPMENT OF ORCHIS PURPURELLA IN ASYMBIOTIC AND INOCULATED CULTURES,In asymbiotic cultures Orchis (Dactylorchis) purpurella seed germinated freely on deionized water agar and on defined and undefined media. Germination was enhanced by prolonged sterilization periods and high temperatures but was inhibited by light. Asymbiotic protocorms never attained the photosynthetic stage except on undefined media. Several Rhizoctonia solani strains enhanced seed germination at low temperatures. The further development of the relationship between host and endophyte varied with the strain; two pathogenic isolates from tomato and rice were strongly symbiotic to protocorms while other strains although stimulating growth ultimately became parasitic. Symbiosis was most stable at low temperatures but with any one strain there was a general pattern of infection in which nutrient depletion in the protocorm was often followed by parasitism. Drip feeding with carbohydrate delayed parasitism but in some conditions led to intense growth of the fungus. It is suggested that a careful balance of nutrients is important in the maintenance of a stable relationship between host and endophyte.

Using a cultivation-dependent approach and 16S rRNA gene amplification techniques, 93 bacterial isolates showing different phenotypic properties were obtained from 20 different subnival plant species, of which gram-positive bacteria (61.5%), psychrotolerant bacteria (67.3%), and pigmented isolates (70.9%) accounted for a large proportion. All these characteristics of endophytes were closely related to the survival environment of their host plants and were in good agreement with microbes occurring in other cold environments. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the endophytic isolates consisted of five phylogenetic groups comprising α-proteobacteria, γ-proteobacteria, the high G+C content gram-positive bacteria, the low G+C content gram-positive bacteria, and Flavobacterium-Bacteroides-Cytophaga. The largest generic diversity was found in the HGC group, while Clavibacter, Agreia, Rhodococcus, Sphingomonas, and Pseudomonas were the most prevalent genera. Of all isolates, 46.4% showed a high sequence similarity (98-100%) to strains discovered from other cold environments such as glaciers, tundra, and polar seas. Furthermore, 36.4% of the isolates produced Indole-3-acetic acid and 76.3% were able to solubilize mineral phosphate, which revealed that endophytic bacteria with multiple physiological functions were abundant and widespread in subnival plants.

Methodology: Taify grapevine leaves were collected from three different locations at Taif region. Total DNA was extracted and the endophytic fungal communities were investigated using next generation sequencing in a metagenomics approach. Results: The obtained data detected 26 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in all locations with variation in most taxa among three locations. The phylum Ascomycota dominated relative sequence abundance (90.83%), followed by Basidiomycota at 1.82%. Other unidentified fungi at phylum level dominated 7.35% abundance level. At genus level, Alternaria and Cladosporium genera were present at all locations, while Filobasidium and Didymella were detected in two locations. Most genera, Penicillium, Hanseniaspora, Fusarium, Chrysocorona and Quambalaria were detected in one location only. Interpretation: The present study confirmed the diversity of endophytic fungi in Taify grapevine, including pathogenic and nonpathogenic species. The detected species have potential to be used as biocontrol species against economically important pathogens such as Alternaria and Hanseniaspora.

The specific objectives were to determine the inhibitory properties of A. ingoldii secondary metabolites (crude extract) on the mycelial growth of a brown-rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum and a white-rot fungus Trametes versicolor, and to determine the effective concentration of A. ingoldii crude preparation against the two decay fungi in vitro. Results show the crude preparation of A. ingoldii from liquid culture possesses significant mycelial growth inhibitory properties that are concentration dependent against the brown-rot and white-rot fungi evaluated. An increase in the concentration of A. ingoldii secondary metabolites significantly decreased the mycelial growth of both wood decay fungi.

4380,Effects of two strains of Streptomyces on root-zone microbes and nematodes for biocontrol of root-knot nematode disease in tomato,"Root knot nematodes (RKN) cause major losses in tomato. Some strains of Streptomyces are known to prevent RKN disease in plants, but little attention has been given to their biocontrol effects in crops such as tomato. In this study, pot experiments were conducted to assess the effects of a Streptomyces agent (1:1 mixture of S. pactum and S. Rochei) for biocontrol of RKN disease in tomato. We quantified endophytes in tomato roots, as well as microbes and nematodes in root zone soil with or without inoculation of Streptomyces. Additionally; we measured the plant biomass and physiobiochemical traits of tomato at different growth stages. The results showed that after inoculation of Streptomyces: (i) The RKN disease index of tomato plants decreased by 37%. The quantity of bacterial-feeding nematodes decreased by 14% in root zone soil, while the quantity of fungal-feeding and plant parasitic nematodes increased by 10% and 137%, respectively. (ii) The fresh weight of shoot and root increased by 14% and 35%, respectively. Meanwhile, the polyphenol oxidase activity of leaves increased by 33% at the seedling stage. (iii) The total number of culturable bacteria decreased by 49% in root knots. Regarding the total number of culturable microbes in root zone soil, bacteria and actinomycetes also decreased by 18% and 10%, respectively, whereas fungi increased by 20%. Moreover, the quantity of both plant growth-promoting bacteria and nematicidal bacteria increased, while the quantity of plant-pathogenic bacteria decreased. In conclusion, the Streptomyces agent could reduce RKN disease in tomato by activating the systemic resistance and defensive mechanism against nematode infection. This agent triggered complex interactions between plants, microbes, and nematodes in the micro-ecosystem of root zone soil, resulting in decreased RKN infection ability and/or enhanced tomato disease resistance.

2148,Functional and transcript analysis of a novel metal transporter gene EpNramp from a dark septate endophyte (Exophiala pisciphila),"Various metal transporters mediate sub-cellular sequestration of diverse metal ions, contribute to cellular metal tolerance, and control metal partitioning, particularly under conditions of high rates of metal influx into organisms. In the current study, a ubiquitous and evolutionary conserved metal transporter gene, homology to natural resistance associated macrophage protein (Nramp), was cloned from a metal tolerant isolate of dark septate endophyte (DSE, Exophiala pisciphila), and its functional and transcript characterization were analyzed. The full-length Nramp gene from E. pisciphila (named EpNramp) was 1716 bp and expected to encode a polypeptide of 571 amino acid residues. EpNramp fused to green fluorescent protein suggested that EpNramp was a plasma membrane metal transporter, which was consistent with the results of bioinformatics analysis with 11 transmembrane domains. Yeast functional complementation revealed that EpNramp could complement the growth defect of Fe-uptake yeast mutant (fet3fet4 double mutant) by mediating the transport of Fe2+. Expression of EpNramp increased Cd2+ sensitivity and Cd2+ accumulation in yeast. In addition, qPCR data revealed that E. pisciphila significantly down regulated EpNramp expression with elevated Cd2+ exposure. Altogether, EpNramp is a bivalent cation transporter localized in cell membrane, which is necessary for efficient translocation of both Fe and Cd, and its activities partly attributed to the tolerance of DSE to toxic and excessive Cd2+ supplements.

17995,Novel Victorivirus from a Pakistani Isolate of Alternaria alternata Lacking a Typical Translational Stop/Restart Sequence Signature.,"The family Totiviridae currently contains five genera Totivirus, Victorivirus, Leishmavirus, Trichomonasvirus, and Giardiavirus. Members in this family generally have a set of two-open reading frame (ORF) elements in their genome with the 5'-proximal ORF (ORF1) encoding a capsid protein (CP) and the 3'-proximal one (ORF2) for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). How the downstream open reading frames (ORFs) are expressed is genus-specific. All victoriviruses characterized thus far appear to use the stop/restart translation mechanism, allowing for the expression of two separate protein products from bicitronic genome-sized viral mRNA, while the totiviruses use a -1 ribosomal frame-shifting that leads to a fusion product of CP and RdRp. We report the biological and molecular characterization of a novel victorivirus termed Alternaria alternata victorivirus 1 (AalVV1) isolated from Alternaria alternata in Pakistan. The phylogenetic and molecular analyses showed AalVV1 to be distinct from previously reported victoriviruses. AalVV1 appears to have a sequence signature required for the -1 frame-shifting at the ORF1/2 junction region, rather than a stop/restart key mediator. By contrast, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and peptide mass fingerprinting analyses of purified virion preparations suggested the expression of two protein products, not a CP-RdRp fusion product. How these proteins are expressed is discussed in this study. Possible effects of infection by this virus were tested in two fungal species: A. alternata and RNA silencing proficient and deficient strains of Cryphonectria parasitica, a model filamentous fungus.

Consequently, the application of different species recognition criteria affects not only diversity estimates but also the ecological hypotheses that arise from those observations. The main objective of the study was to examine how the choice and number of genetic markers and species delimitation criteria influence biodiversity estimates. Here, we compare approaches to defining species boundaries in three dominant species complexes of tropical endophytes, specially Colletotrichum gloeosporioides agg., Pestalotiopsis microspora agg. and Trichoderma harzianum agg., from two Amazonian trees: Hevea brasiliensis and H. guianensis. Molecular tools were used to describe and compare the diversity of the different assemblages. Multilocus phylogenetic analyses [gpd, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and tef1] and modern techniques for phylogenetic species delimitation were overlaid with ecological data to recognize putative species or OTUs. The results demonstrate that ITS alone generally underestimates the number of species predicted by other nuclear loci. These results question the use of ITS and arbitrary divergence thresholds for species delimitation.","Gazis, R; Rehner, S; Chaverri, P",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2011,10.1111/j.1365-294X.2011.05110.x,0.983803162187327,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.980369415355228,0.0196305846447717,0.999985713269631,1.428673036874e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

12223,"The Effectiveness of a Dark Septate Endophytic Fungus, Cladophialophora chaetospira SK51, to Mitigate Strawberry Fusarium Wilt Disease and With Growth Promotion Activities","Strawberry Fusarium wilt, caused by the virulent fungus Fusarium oxysporum formae speciales fragariae (Fof) is a devastating soil-borne disease that causes severe production losses worldwide, including Japan. Fof is one of the top 10 fungal pathogens that threaten global crop security, and a method to effectively control this pathogen has yet to be found. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungi against Fof to develop an efficient, effective, and environmentally friendly approach to improve plant health and fitness. A total of 19 fungal isolates were assessed, out of which three (SK47, SK48, and SK51) were selected based on their effectiveness in disease suppression in controlled growth chamber conditions using a soil system. Isolates SK47, SK48, and SK51 suppressed disease severity by 85.71, 61.90, and 90.48%, respectively. Molecular identification based on highly conserved small subunit (SSU), internal transcribed spacer (ITS), and large subunit (LSU) nrRNA regions identified these isolates as DSE Exophiala sp., Exophiala pisciphila, and Cladophialophora chaetospira, respectively. The sequences were deposited under accession numbers - in the GenBank database. Notably, our results revealed that isolate C. chaetospira SK51 possessed superior growth promotion activities as well as disease suppression by significantly increased plant growth parameters (shoot and root dry mass, chlorophyll content, flower bud initiation, and number of fruit) in comparison to control plants and other two fungal candidates. Root colonization by C. chaetospira SK51 was visualized, and it was confirmed that the symbiosis with strawberry plants occurred successfully. Our results provide new insights in the application of DSE fungus C. chaetospira SK51 as a biocontrol agent on strawberry plants could promote plant growth, flower bud initiation, and fruit formation. C. chaetospira SK51 exhibited remarkable beneficial traits for the host plant, and it can potentially be applied in the development of new, safe, and effective treatments as an alternative to chemical fertilizers and fungicides for sustainable crop protection.","Harsonowati, W; Marian, M; Surono; Narisawa, K",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2020,10.3389/fmicb.2020.00585,0.974487147888216,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998627453807583,0.00137254619241678,0.999999971559241,2.84407589701274e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Here, we showed that the FWD incidence was significantly negatively correlated with the diversity of both rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities. Using the microbiological culturomic approach, we selected 205 unique strains to construct different synthetic communities (SynComs), which were inoculated into germ-free tomato seedlings, and their roles in suppressing FWD were monitored using omics approach. Cross-kingdom (fungi and bacteria) SynComs were most effective in suppressing FWD than those of Fungal or Bacterial SynComs alone. This effect was underpinned by a combination of molecular mechanisms related to plant immunity and microbial interactions contributed by the bacterial and fungal communities. This study provides new insight into the dynamics of microbiota in pathogen suppression and host immunity interactions.

12478,"Gummy stem blight: One disease, three pathogens","Gummy stem blight (GSB) is a major disease of cucurbits worldwide. It is caused by three fungal species that are morphologically identical and have overlapping geographic and host ranges. Controlling GSB is challenging due to the lack of resistant cultivars and the pathogens' significant ability to develop resistance to systemic fungicides. The causal agent of GSB is recognized as a complex of three phylogenetically distinct species belonging to domain Eukaryota, kingdom Fungi, phylum Ascomycota, subphylum Pezizomycotina, class Dothideomycetes, subclass Pleosporomycetida, order Pleosporales, family Didymellaceae, genus Stagonosporopsis, species cucurbitacearum, citrulli, and caricae. Pycnidia are tan with dark rings of cells around the ostiole measuring 120-180 mu m in diameter. Conidia are 6-13 mu m long, hyaline, cylindrical with round ends, and non- or monoseptate. Pseudothecia are black and globose in shape and have a diameter of 125-213 mu m. Ascospores are 14-18 x 4-6 mu m long, hyaline, ellipsoidal with round ends, and monoseptate with a distinct constriction at the septum. Eight ascospores are found per ascus. The upper end of the apical cell is pointed, whereas the lower end of the bottom cell is blunt. Species-specific PCR primers that can be used in a multiplex conventional PCR assay are available. The GSB species complex is pathogenic to 37 species of cucurbits from 21 different genera. S. cucurbitacearum and S. citrulli are specific to cucurbits, while S. caricae is also pathogenic to papaya and babaco-mirim (Vasconcellea monoica), a related fruit. Under favourable environmental conditions, symptoms can appear 3-12 days after spore germination. Leaf spots often start at the leaf margin or extend to the margins. Spots expand and coalesce, resulting in leaf blighting. Active lesions are typically water-soaked. Cankers are observed on crowns, main stems, and vines. Red to amber gummy exudates are often seen on the stems after cankers develop on cortical tissue.","Seblani, R; Keinath, AP; Munkvold, G",MOLECULAR PLANT PATHOLOGY,2023,10.1111/mpp.13339,0.781396007621761,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999477934778505,5.2206522149485e-4,0.999999999893418,1.0658218752013201e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

In addition, climatic and chemical properties of the soils were determined in order to investigate their influence on mycorrhizal variables. VAM fungal association in the sedges was confirmed by plant- and root-trap culture techniques. The soil nutrients exhibited seasonal variations, but were highly variable between years. Intercellular hyphae and vesicles with occasional intraradical spores characterized mycorrhizal association in sedges. Dark septate fungi also colonized roots of sedges. Temporal variations in mycorrhizal colonization and spore numbers occurred, indicating seasonality. However, the patterns of mycorrhizal colonization and spore numbers were different during both the years. The VAM fungal structures observed were intercellular hyphae and vesicles. Changes in the proportion of root length with VAM structures, total colonization levels and spore numbers were related to climatic and edaphic factors. However, the intensity of influence of climatic and soil factors on VAM tended to vary with sedge species. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

3274,Interspecific hybridization and bioactive alkaloid variation increases diversity in endophytic Epichloe species of Bromus laevipes,"Studying geographic variation of microbial mutualists, especially variation in traits related to benefits they provide their host, is critical for understanding how these associations impact key ecological processes. In this study, we investigate the phylogenetic population structure of Epichloe species within Bromus laevipes, a native cool-season bunchgrass found predominantly in California. Phylogenetic classification supported inference of three distinct Epichloe taxa, of which one was nonhybrid and two were interspecific hybrids. Inheritance of mating-type idiomorphs revealed that at least one of the hybrid species arose from independent hybridization events. We further investigated the geographic variation of endophyte-encoded alkaloid genes, which is often associated with key benefits of natural enemy protection for the host. Marker diversity at the ergot alkaloid, loline, indole-diterpene, and peramine loci revealed four alkaloid genotypes across the three identified Epichloe species. Predicted chemotypes were tested using endophyte-infected plant material that represented each endophyte genotype, and 11 of the 13 predicted alkaloids were confirmed. This multifaceted approach combining phylogenetic, genotypic, and chemotypic analyses allowed us to reconstruct the diverse evolutionary histories of Epichloe species present within B.laevipes and highlight the complex and dynamic processes underlying these grass-endophyte symbioses.","Charlton, ND; Craven, KD; Afkhami, ME; Hall, BA; Ghimire, SR; Young, CA",FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY,2014,10.1111/1574-6941.12393,0.645130634480941,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99999815186997,1.84813002975909e-6,0.999999999987196,1.2804424187606899e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
17270,First Report of Powdery Mildew Caused by Erysiphe heraclei on Parsley in Korea.,"Parsley, Petroselinum crispum (Mill.) Nyman, is a minor but important leaf crop in Korea. In June 2010, parsley plants (cv. Paramount) showing typical symptoms of powdery mildew were found with approximately 90% incidence (percentage of plants showing symptoms) in polyethylene-film-covered greenhouses in an organic farm in Icheon County of Korea. Symptoms first appeared as thin white colonies, which subsequently showed abundant growth on the leaves with chlorosis and crinkling. Most diseased plantings were unmarketable and shriveled without being harvested. The damage due to powdery mildew infections on parsley has reappeared in Icheon County and Gangneung City with confirmation of the causal agent made again in 2011 and 2012. Voucher specimens were deposited in the Korea University Herbarium (KUS). Appressoria on the mycelium were multilobed or moderately lobed. Conidiophores were cylindrical, 75 to 125 × 8 to 10 μm, straight in foot-cells, and produced conidia singly, followed by 2 to 3 cells. Conidia were oblong-elliptical to oblong, 32 to 55 × 14 to 20 μm with a length/width ratio of 1.7 to 2.9, lacked fibrosin bodies, and produced germ tubes on the perihilar position, with angular/rectangular wrinkling of the outer walls. First-formed conidia were apically conical, basally subtruncate to rounded, and generally smaller than the secondary conidia. Chasmothecia were not found. These structures are typical of the powdery mildew Pseudoidium anamorph of the genus Erysiphe. The specific measurements and morphological characteristics were consistent with those of E. heraclei DC. (1). To confirm the identity of the causal fungus, the complete ITS region of rDNA from isolate KUS-F25037 was amplified with primers ITS5 and P3 (3) and sequenced directly. The resulting 606-bp sequence was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. KF680162). A GenBank BLAST search of this sequence revealed 100% identity with that of E. heraclei on Anethum graveolens from Korea (JN603995) and >99% similarity with those of E. heraclei on Daucus carota from Mexico (GU252368), Pimpinella affinis from Iran (AB104513), Anthriscus cerefolium from Korea (KF111807), and many other parsley family (Apiaceae) plants. Pathogenicity was verified through inoculation by gently pressing diseased leaves onto leaves of five healthy potted parsley plants. Five non-inoculated plants served as negative controls. Inoculated plants developed symptoms after 7 days, whereas the control plants remained symptomless. The fungus present on the inoculated plants was morphologically identical to that originally observed on diseased plants. Parsley powdery mildew caused by E. heraclei has been known in Europe, North America, Brazil, and Japan (2,4). To our knowledge, this is the first report of powdery mildew infections by E. heraclei on parsley in Korea. Since cultivation of parsley was only recently started on a commercial scale in Korea, powdery mildew infections pose a serious threat to safe production of this herb, especially those grown in organic farming where chemical options are limited.

21219,Diversity of type i polyketide synthase genes in a bioactive Phoma sp. endophytic fungus isolated from Cinnamomum molissimum in Malaysia,"Endophytic fungi are known as excellent producers of bioactive natural products. An endophytic Phoma sp. fungus isolated from the medicinal plant Cinnamomum molissimum in Malaysia was found to produce several polyketide compounds including 5-hydroxyramulosin, a potent antifungal and cytotoxic compound with unknown biosynthetic pathways. The diversity of type I polyketide synthase (PKS) genes in this fungus was evaluated with a PCR-based approach using eight degenerate primer pairs targeting the ketosynthase (KS) and ketosynthase-acyltransferase (KS-AT) interdomain. Following amplification, 11 distinct putative PKS gene fragments were cloned and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis of the PKS amino acid sequences revealed the biosynthesis potential for a wide range of polyketide compounds, including reduced, partially reduced and non-reduced polyketides. The PKS genes identified include one for the synthesis of tetrahydroxynaphthalene, and two apparently novel genes which differ from presently known PKS genes. These results demonstrate that PKS genes in the endophytic bioactive Phoma sp. are diverse and this isolate has the genomic capacity for producing more than ten different polyketide compounds including possibly unique compounds. The degenerate PCR approach was found to be a valuable method for determining the diversity of PKS genes and could be used to screen fungi with potential for producing bioactive compounds.",Refaei J.; Hussein Z.A.M.; Santhanam J.,Journal of Pure and Applied Microbiology,2014,NA,0.910014718778862,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.479506991291745,0.520493008708255,0.999999436083951,5.63916048745838e-7,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
3207,Fungicolous xylariaceous fungi in coralloid basidiomata,"Fifteen species of xylariaceous fungi were isolated from more than 100 Scytinopogon sp. basidiomata in three forests and identified by rDNA ITS sequencing. Xylariaceous fungi were present in the lower part of the basidiomata, occurred less often in the upper part and were absent in the tips of its coralloid basidiomata. These results indicated that xylariaceous fungi grow continuously in the basidiomata and that the apical growth of Scytinopogon sp. basidiomata was faster than the growth of xylariaceous fungi in its host. The results suggested that these xylariaceous fungi established a stable coexistence with Scytinopogon sp. in the forest. Five species of xylariaceous fungi were endophytes in nearby plants. Our study suggested that these endophytic xylariaceous fungi were sources of fungicolous fungi in Scytinopogon sp. in the forest. (C) 2016 Elsevier. Ltd and British Mycological Society.

2798,Distance to semi-natural habitats matters for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in wheat roots and wheat performance in a temperate agricultural landscape,"IntroductionThe proximity of semi-natural habitats and agricultural fields in an agricultural landscape leads to unavoidable biological, chemical, and physical interactions. Fungi can negatively influence, but also support crop growth in agricultural fields. Therefore, in this field study we investigated the colonisation of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and non-AM fungi in winter-wheat roots as well as winter-wheat performance in distance to semi-natural habitats.Materials and MethodsWe sampled in an intensively managed agricultural landscape in North-east Germany along agricultural transition zones, that is, along 50 m-transects from semi-natural habitats like hedgerows and glacially created in-field ponds-so-called kettle holes-into agricultural fields.ResultsTo our knowledge, we show for the first time that AM fungal colonisation in winter-wheat roots decreased linearly with increasing distance to semi-natural habitats while non-AM fungal root colonisation did not change. Winter-wheat grain yield and biomass slightly increased with increasing distance to hedgerows but not to kettle holes. This clearly shows that there is a difference between different crop performance parameters. Random forest machine learning algorithms confirmed the particular importance of distance to semi-natural habitats for AM fungal root colonisation and for winter-wheat grain yield. Less intensive agricultural management close to semi-natural habitats, for example, no herbicide and pesticide applications as a result of nature protection regulations, may partly explain this pattern. However, spatial response patterns of AM but not of non-AM fungi in wheat roots also point to changed ecological interactions close to semi-natural habitats.ConclusionSemi-natural and natural habitats in agricultural landscapes are slowly recognised not only to be important for biodiversity conservation, but also for sustainable crop production. Additionally, they may also be a tool for farmers and policy makers to improve sustainable landscape management. And agricultural transition zones are spatially and temporally complex dynamic ecosystems that should be the focus of further investigations. image","Walzl, KP; Ryo, M; Raatz, L; Petermann, JS; Gessler, A; Joshi, J; Rillig, MC",JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT,2022,10.1002/sae2.12032,0.876030785199596,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998966785879927,0.00103321412007325,0.999999999602054,3.97945676411382e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10750,Evaluation of Streptomyces spp. for effective management of Poria hypolateritia causing red root-rot disease in tea plants,"A field study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of indigenous biocontrol agents such as Streptomyces griseus and Streptomyces lydicus along with Bacillus subtilis and Trichoderma harzianum for controlling red root rot disease of tea plants. In response to biological treatments, disease incidence, green leaf yield, biometric and physiological parameters and organoleptic characters of made tea were assessed. Among the thirteen treatments tested, soil drenching of carbendazim was superior in terms of reducing red root rot incidence followed by combination of S. griseus and T. harzianum recorded in two consecutive field experiments. In contrast, the maximum green leaf yield and plant growth was achieved in soil application of these biocontrol agents. However, the performance of this dual combination of biocontrol agents was on par with systemic fungicide in terms of disease control. Correspondingly, the biometric, physiological and biochemical parameters were also considerably increased in biologically treated plants when compared to untreated control. The disease increased from 38.7% to 47.6% in untreated control plots and those plants were unhealthy in terms of leaf yellowing, stunted growth with heavy flowering, drying of branches and sudden death of bushes. The tea quality parameters such as theaflavin and thearubigin contents were significantly increased in the range of 0.75-1.43% and 10.38-13.22% respectively in biocontrol treated plants. This was also reflected in tea liquor characteristics. Our results suggested that the combination of biocontrol agents represent a promising alternative for effective management of red root rot disease in tea plants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

4693,Effects of Endophytic Entomopathogenic Ascomycetes on the Life-History Traits of Aphis gossypii Glover and Its Interactions with Melon Plants,"Entomopathogenic fungi are sprayed commercially for aphid control in greenhouses. Recently, their ability to grow endophytically within plants was discovered, offering the opportunity for systemic biological control. Endophytic colonization of host plants could also influence life-table parameters and behavior of herbivores. We investigated lethal and pre-mortality effects of Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium brunneum on Aphis gossypii; aphids either received inoculum while feeding on recently sprayed leaves (surface inoculum and endophytically-colonized) or while feeding on unsprayed but endophytically-colonized leaves. We used choice assays to identify any preferences for endophytically-colonized or control plants. Volatile emissions from endophytically-colonized plants and control plants were also compared. Aphid mortality rates ranged between 48.2 and 56.9% on sprayed leaves, and between 37.7 and 50.0 on endophytically-colonized leaves. There was a significant effect of endophytic colonization on the rate of nymph production, but this did not result in an overall increase in the aphid population. Endophytic colonization did not influence host-plant selection even though there were qualitative and quantitative differences in the blend of volatiles released by endophytically-colonized and control plants. Although endophytic colonization did not change herbivore behavior, plants still benefit via indirect defense, resistance to plant pathogens or abiotic stress tolerance.","González-Mas, N; Sánchez-Ortiz, A; Valverde-García, P; Quesada-Moraga, E",INSECTS,2019,10.3390/insects10060165,0.926241042246189,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985769900406454,0.014230099593546,0.999999999958774,4.12259115734059e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

18730,Improving maize growth through biopriming with seed endophytic Bacillus tequilensis LRB17.,"Maize (Zea mays L.) is the third most cultivated crop globally after wheat and rice. It is one of the important staple food crops in the tribal-inhabited forest areas in India, where reduced yield is observed due to lower soil nutrients. Biopriming with bacteria having plant growth promotion (PGP) effects could be an effective way to mitigate this problem. In this context, a potential Bacillus tequilensis LRB17 strain was bioprimed in maize cultivar for the first time for PGP. Treatment of maize with the bacterium could enhance seedling vigor by 19.56%. The root and shoot length and the root and shoot weights were enhanced by 120.21% and 121.41% and 43.03% and 40.07%, respectively. Average height of matured plants, average leaf area, and plant biomass could be enhanced by 19.30%, 30.47%, and 311.30%, respectively.

12561,Effects of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the diversity of culturable microfungi and nematodes associated with tomato:: impact on root-knot disease and plant growth,"The available information on Pseudomonas biocontrol inoculants on the non-target fungal and nematode community is scant. The current paper addresses this issue and investigates the effects of biocontrol agents Pseudomonas aeruginosa IE-6 and 1E-6S(+) (previously shown to suppress several soil-borne plant pathogens) on soil microfungi and plant-parasitic nematodes as well as on the root-knot development and growth of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). Furadan, a granular nematicide was included as a treatment for comparative purposes. Treatments were applied to soil at the start of each 52-day-long tomato growth cycle, and their effects on the composition and diversity of rhizosphere and endophytic microfungi and plant-parasitic nematodes were examined at the end of first and fourth growth cycle. Several diversity indices were employed to assess community diversity. A total of 16 genera comprising 23 microfungal species were isolated from the tomato rhizosphere. The most abundant fungal species belonged to the genera Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Penicillium. With a few exceptions, fungi were neither exclusively inhibited nor specifically promoted by the application of treatments at any of the growth cycles studied. However, Paecilomyces lilancinus, an egg and female parasite of root-knot nematode, though exclusively absent in the controls was isolated from the treatments. Both general diversity and equitability of rhizosphere microfungi were greater at first compared to the fourth growth cycle while species richness remained uninfluenced across the growth cycles and treatments. However, Furadan and IE-6S(+) treatments considerably abated general diversity and equitability. Of the microfungal species isolated from the rhizosphere seven were also recovered from surface-sterilized root tissue of tomato suggesting that all the endophytes are primarily rhizosphere organisms. Diversity of endophytic fungi was consistently lower compared with that of the rhizosphere. Both general diversity and equitability declined in all three treatments relative to controls in the root tissue but species richness remained unaltered. Diversity and equitability of plant-parasitic nematodes in soil were reduced by all three treatments over the controls at fourth growth cycle whilst species richness did not change at either growth cycle. The biocontrol agents significantly reduced root-knot development and enhanced shoot growth of tomato over the controls. The possible implications of fungal composition and abundance because of biocontrol by Pseudomonas application are discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

17111,The hyperaccumulator Sedum plumbizincicola harbors metal-resistant endophytic bacteria that improve its phytoextraction capacity in multi-metal contaminated soil.,"Endophyte-assisted phytoremediation has recently been suggested as a successful approach for ecological restoration of metal contaminated soils, however little information is available on the influence of endophytic bacteria on the phytoextraction capacity of metal hyperaccumulating plants in multi-metal polluted soils. The aims of our study were to isolate and characterize metal-resistant and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) utilizing endophytic bacteria from tissues of the newly discovered Zn/Cd hyperaccumulator Sedum plumbizincicola and to examine if these endophytic bacterial strains could improve the efficiency of phytoextraction of multi-metal contaminated soils. Among a collection of 42 metal resistant bacterial strains isolated from the tissues of S. plumbizincicola grown on Pb/Zn mine tailings, five plant growth promoting endophytic bacterial strains (PGPE) were selected due to their ability to promote plant growth and to utilize ACC as the sole nitrogen source. The five isolates were identified as Bacillus pumilus E2S2, Bacillus sp. E1S2, Bacillus sp. E4S1, Achromobacter sp. E4L5 and Stenotrophomonas sp. E1L and subsequent testing revealed that they all exhibited traits associated with plant growth promotion, such as production of indole-3-acetic acid and siderophores and solubilization of phosphorus. These five strains showed high resistance to heavy metals (Cd, Zn and Pb) and various antibiotics. Further, inoculation of these ACC utilizing strains significantly increased the concentrations of water extractable Cd and Zn in soil. Moreover, a pot experiment was conducted to elucidate the effects of inoculating metal-resistant ACC utilizing strains on the growth of S. plumbizincicola and its uptake of Cd, Zn and Pb in multi-metal contaminated soils. Out of the five strains, B. pumilus E2S2 significantly increased root (146%) and shoot (17%) length, fresh (37%) and dry biomass (32%) of S. plumbizincicola as well as plant Cd uptake (43%), whereas Bacillus sp. E1S2 significantly enhanced the accumulation of Zn (18%) in plants compared with non-inoculated controls. The inoculated strains also showed high levels of colonization in rhizosphere and plant tissues.

17174,Characterization of the cultivable bacterial populations associated with field grown Brassica napus L.: an evaluation of sampling and isolation protocols.,"Plant-associated bacteria are intensively investigated concerning their characteristics for plant growth promotion, biocontrol mechanisms and enhanced phytoremediation efficiency. To obtain endophytes, different sampling and isolation protocols are used although their representativeness is not always clearly demonstrated. The objective of this study was to acquire representative pictures of the cultivable bacterial root, stem and leaf communities for all Brassica napus L. individuals growing on the same field. For each plant organ, genotypic identifications of the endophytic communities were performed using three replicates. Root replicates were composed of three total root systems, whereas stem and leaf replicates needed to consist of six independent plant parts in order to be representative. Greater variations between replicates were found when considering phenotypic characteristics. Correspondence analysis revealed reliable phenotypic results for roots and even shoots, but less reliable ones for leaves. Additionally, realistic Shannon-Wiener biodiversity indices were calculated for all three organs and showed similar Evenness factors. Furthermore, it was striking that all replicates and thus the whole plant contained Pseudomonas and Bacillus strains although aboveground and belowground plant tissues differed in most dominant bacterial genera and characteristics.",Croes S; Weyens N; Colpaert J; Vangronsveld J,Environmental microbiology,2015,10.1111/1462-2920.12701,0.84283719144101,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.463805562267751,0.536194437732249,0.999548057573305,4.5194242669499e-4,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

18779,"A review on fungal endophytes of the family Fabaceae, their metabolic diversity and biological applications.","Fabaceae is considered the third largest family of the plant kingdom, comprising of a large number of plants, belonging to 650 genera and 20,000 species of plants. Out of the various plant species that are reported in the family Fabaceae, many of the species have been reported to exhibit diverse pharmacological activities and are of economic importance to agriculturists and scientists across the globe. Studies over the last few decades have unraveled a lot of concrete information about different plants, ranging from the mutualistic interdependence of plants and microbes for their survival to the innumerable benefits of plants in the sectors of agriculture, food industry, medicine, and healthcare. The survival and effective maintenance of plant homeostasis is largely regulated by the diverse microbial population that co-exists in symbiotic relationships with plants. This endophytic microbial population can be either categorized as endophytic bacteria or endophytic fungi. The studies over the past decades have highlighted the crucial role of both endophytic bacteria and fungi in the growth and development of plants. This review explores the ameliorative roles of endophytic fungi in alleviating biotic and abiotic stresses in plants. Additionally, it highlights the vast diversity of secondary metabolites produced by these fungi and their potential applications. Secondary metabolites exhibit a wide range of biologically significant activities, including anticancer, antimicrobial, antimalarial, and nematicidal properties, which hold substantial importance in therapeutic and agricultural applications.

1806,Fungal endophyte Epichloe bromicola infection regulates anatomical changes to account for salt stress tolerance in wild barley (Hordeum brevisubulatum),"Background and aims Plants can minimize the adverse effects of salinity by modifying morphological and anatomical features. Previous studies showed that endophytic Epichloe bromicola play an important role in improving wild barley (Hordeum brevisubulatum) salinity tolerance. The aim of this work is to understand whether Epichloe endophyte affects the anatomical structures of host H. brevisubulatum under salinity environments. Methods Seedlings of E. bromicola infected (E+) and E. bromicola free (E-) H. brevisubulatum were treated with different NaCl concentrations, with the control seedlings being grown without NaCl. Anatomical structures of roots, stems and leaves were observed by making paraffin sections with double staining dehydration methods (safranin and fast green). Results NaCl treatments significantly affected the anatomical structure of H. brevisubulatum. Vascular tissue area throughout the leaf, stem and root decreased as the NaCl concentration increased. Thickness of epidermis in stems and leaves, and the cortex in roots also decreased with salt level increases. Endodermis thickness, epidermis thickness and stele area in roots were increased under salinity stress. The presence of Epichloe endophyte regulated some anatomical structure modifications. Epichloe infection was associated with significant higher conducting tissues (including leaf xylem, leaf phloem, stem vascular bundles, stem xylem vessels and root meta-xylem area). The increased thickness of leaf veins, epidermis in stems, cortex and endodermis in roots were also associated with Epichloe endophyte infection under NaCl stress. Conclusions The presence of Epichloe endophyte ameliorated adverse effects of salinity on H. brevisubulatum. We observed specific changes of anatomical structures that may help in inhibiting water loss and inhibiting decrease of transport capacity for better conduction of water, nutrients, photosynthates and re-translocation of assimilates to suppress negative effects of salinity and enhance the tolerance of H. brevisubulatum to salt stress.","Chen, TX; White, JF; Li, CJ",PLANT AND SOIL,2021,10.1007/s11104-021-04828-w,0.98052401307607,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999999872541094,1.27458905668215e-7,0.999999999999748,2.51909604287448e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12810,"Apple endophyte community in relation to location, scion and rootstock genotypes and susceptibility to European canker","European apple canker, caused by Neonectria ditissima, is a severe disease of apple. Achieving effective control is difficult with the currently available pesticides. Specific apple endophytes associated with cultivars may partially contribute to the cultivar response to the pathogen and thus could be used for disease management. We sought to determine whether the overall endophyte community differed among cultivars differing in their susceptibility to N. ditissima and to identify specific microbial groups associated with the susceptibility. Using Illumina MiSeq meta-barcoding, we profiled apple tree endophytes in 16 scion-rootstock combinations at two locations and quantified the relative contribution of scion, rootstock and location to the observed variability in the endophyte communities. Endophyte diversity was primarily affected by the orchard location (accounting for 29.4% and 85.9% of the total variation in the PC1 for bacteria and fungi, respectively), followed by the scion genotype (24.3% and 19.5% of PC2), whereas rootstock effects were small (<3% of PC1 and PC2). There were significant differences in the endophyte community between canker-resistant and -susceptible cultivars. Several bacterial and fungal endophyte groups had different relative abundance between susceptible and resistant cultivars. These endophyte groups included putative pathogen antagonists as well as plant pathogens. Their possible ecological roles in the N. ditissima pathosystem are discussed.","Olivieri, L; Saville, RJ; Gange, AC; Xu, XM",FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY,2021,10.1093/femsec/fiab131,0.818055895545154,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.962479024110949,0.0375209758890511,0.999971451757846,2.85482421542582e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
17282,First Report of Gray Mold on Amorphophallus muelleri Caused by Botrytis cinerea in China.,"Amorphophallus muelleri is a perennial tuberous plant in the family Araceae. The name konjac is commonly used for the species of genus Amorphophallus that produce a polysaccharide, glucomannan. The latter, called konjac glucomannan, is extracted from the tubers of these species. Glucomannan is an excellent gelling agent used in food, pharmaceutical and chemical industry, a specialty crop grown as a source of glucomannan for industrial use. It is an important cash crop and thus contributes to poverty alleviation in southwest China. Its planting area is about 150 million mu (10 million ha). In July 2012, symptoms of an unknown blight were observed on 5 to 10% of A. muelleri flowers and seeds being grown for commercial seed production. Greenhouses temperatures ranged from 20 to 34°C (avg. 26°C). A light grey mycelium was observed on symptomatic tissues, especially flowers. Severely infected flowers and stems eventually rotted, then dried out. Diseased tissue was excised from affected flowers and surfaces and disinfected with 1% sodium hypochlorite, followed by 70% alcohol. The tissue was then rinsed in sterile distilled water, plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at 26°C. Mycelial growth on PDA was initially whitish and turned gray with age. Dark appearing conidiophores bore botryose heads of hyaline, ellipsoid, unicellular conidia, grey in mass, measuring 7.2 (6.2 to 9.5) × 5.3 (4.5 to 6.0) μm. Black, irregular sclerotia formed at random in the culture. These morphological features were typical of those described for Botrytis cinerea (2). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified using primers ITS4/ITS6 and sequenced (1). BLAST analysis of a 557-bp segment had a 99% similarity with the sequence of Botryotinia fuckeliana (anamorph = B. cinerea). The representative nucleotide sequence has been assigned the GenBank Accession No. KC999986. On the basis of morphological and molecular results, the fungus isolated from diseased konjac flowers and flower tissue was confirmed to be B. cinerea. Pathogenicity tests: Inoculum was prepared from 7-day-old cultures on PDA. Six flowering A. muelleri in 1-liter pots were spray inoculated with a 1.0 × 106 conidia/ml suspension from 7-day-old PDA cultures. As a control, six healthy plants were sprayed with sterile distilled water. Each plant was covered with a transparent polyethylene bag for 3 days and maintained in a greenhouse at temperatures between 20 and 26°C. After 8 days, small, round to irregular brown spots developed on both flowers and stems, which finally blighted. Water-treated plants remained symptomless. Koch's postulates were fulfilled when the pathogen was re-isolated from the diseased organs. Blight on common calla lily (calla lily and Amorphophallus are in the same family, different genera) flower attributed to B. cinerea was previously reported in Argentina (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of B. cinerea on A. muelleri in China. References: (1) D. E. L. Cooke and J. M. Duncan. Mycol. Res. 101:667, 1997. (2) M. B. Ellis.

15111,Diversity and antioxidant activity of endophytic fungi isolated from salam (Syzygium polyanthum),"Widjajanti H, Elfita, Sari MT, Hidayati N, Hariani PL, Setiawan A. 2023. Diversity and antioxidant activity of endophytic fungi isolated from salam (Syzygium polyanthum). Biodiversitas 24: 3051-3062. Salam (Syzygium polyanthum (Wight) Walp.) is a medicinal plant from the family Myrtaceae. The leaves are used as a spice and treat diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, ulcers, diarrhea, gastritis, and skin. This study aimed to determine endophytic fungi's diversity and antioxidant activity in the S. polyanthum plant. In addition, the distribution of endophytic fungi found on S. polyanthum was compared to that of previously reported endophytic fungi on other species of Syzygium. The distribution pattern of these endophytic fungi is needed to determine the presence of potential endophytic fungi that can live in host plants of the same genus. The endophytic fungi were isolated from fresh root bark, stem bark, and leaf tissues of S. polyanthum. The endophytic fungi were identified morphologically to determine their level of diversity; their extract was then tested for their antioxidant activity using the DPPH method. The extract that showed the highest antioxidant activity was identified molecularly. A total of 18 endophytic fungi were obtained from S. polyanthum, including seven isolates from root bark (HSA1–HSA7), four isolates from stem bark (HSB1–HSB4), and seven isolates from leaves (HSD1–HSD7). The morphological identification showed seven genera scattered in all investigated parts: Trichoderma, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Pythium, Papulaspora, Pythiogeton, and Clonostachys. The HSD5 isolate showed the best antioxidant activity, and the molecular identification confirmed this isolate as Clonostachys rosea. The comparison of the distribution of endophytic fungi isolated from S. polyanthum to endophytic fungi isolated from the host genus Syzygium showed that endophytic fungi of three genera, namely Clonostachys, Papulaspora, and Pythiogeton, are specifically found on S. polyanthum. In addition, those of four other genera, namely Trichoderma, Aspergillus, Penicillium, and Pythium, are found on other species of Syzygium. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

4675,Microbial Endophytes that Live within the Seeds of Two Tomato Hybrids Cultivated in Argentina,"Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) is probably the most important vegetable consumed around the world, and like other produce is affected by stresses and diseases that reduce the yield and production. The purpose of this work was to study the phytobiome of the tomato seeds of two hybrids in order to understand first of all whether tomato cultivars host similar groups of organisms, as well as their effect on the community structure, particularly of those microbes with the potential to promote growth and/or control plant pathogens. Different cultivars of tomato (genotypes) host significantly different endophytic communities, which is also reflected at the order level. These communities are particularly rich in spore-forming bacteria that have the ability either to promote plant growth or synthetize antimicrobial compounds that deter plant pathogens. We conclude that the seeds of the tomato cultivars Elpida and Silverio are sources of endophytic bacteria capable of synthetizing antifungal substances that could potentially be used for biocontrol against plant-pathogenic fungi.","López, SMY; Pastorino, GN; Franco, MEE; Medina, R; Lucentini, CG; Saparrat, MCN; Balatti, PA",AGRONOMY-BASEL,2018,10.3390/agronomy8080136,0.957988697119527,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99930640586071,6.9359413929034e-4,0.999975377549783,2.4622450216838e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18167,A Bacterial Endophyte from Apoplast Fluids Protects Canola Plants from Different Phytopathogens via Antibiosis and Induction of Host Resistance.,"Endophytic bacteria colonize inner plant tissues and thrive at the apoplast, which is considered its main reservoir. Because this niche is the place where the main molecular events take place between beneficial and pathogenic microorganisms, the aim of this work was to characterize culturable endophytic bacteria from apoplastic fluids obtained from field-grown canola leaves and analyze their potential for biological control of diseases caused by Xanthomonas campestris, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and Leptosphaeria maculans. Dual-culture analysis indicated that three isolates (Apo8, Apo11, and Apo12) were able to inhibit the growth of all three phytopathogens. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA and rpoD genes of these isolates revealed that they are closely related to Pseudomonas viridiflava. One of the isolates, Apo11, was able to diminish the propagation of X. campestris in whole-plant assays. At the same time, Apo11 inoculation reduced the necrotic lesions provoked by S. sclerotiorum on canola leaves. This protective effect might be due to the induction of resistance in the host mediated by salicylic and jasmonic acid signaling pathways or the production of compounds with antimicrobial activity. At the same time, Apo11 inoculation promoted canola plant growth. Thus, the isolate characterized in this work has several desirable characteristics, which make it a potential candidate for the formulation of biotechnological products to control plant diseases or promote plant growth.",Romero FM; Rossi FR; Gárriz A; Carrasco P; Ruíz OA,Phytopathology,2019,10.1094/PHYTO-07-18-0262-R,0.686684302585621,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.918713228578188,0.0812867714218119,0.999963305353666,3.66946463342677e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

19792,Antifungal Effect of All-trans Retinoic Acid against Aspergillus fumigatus In Vitro and in a Pulmonary Aspergillosis In Vivo Model.,"Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common opportunistic fungal pathogen and causes invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), with high mortality among immunosuppressed patients. The fungistatic activity of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been recently described in vitro We evaluated the efficacy of ATRA in vivo and its potential synergistic interaction with other antifungal drugs. A rat model of IPA and in vitro experiments were performed to assess the efficacy of ATRA against Aspergillus in association with classical antifungal drugs and in silico studies used to clarify its mechanism of action. ATRA (0.5 and 1 mM) displayed a strong fungistatic activity in Aspergillus cultures, while at lower concentrations, synergistically potentiated fungistatic efficacy of subinhibitory concentration of amphotericin B (AmB) and posaconazole (POS). ATRA also enhanced macrophagic phagocytosis of conidia. In a rat model of IPA, ATRA reduced mortality similarly to posaconazole. Fungistatic efficacy of ATRA alone and synergistically with other antifungal drugs was documented in vitro, likely by inhibiting fungal heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) expression and Hsp90-related genes.

Abundance of external mycelium attached to the root surface and parameters of internal fungal colonization, i.e. intensity of colonization, and arbuscule and vesicle/spore abundance, were evaluated. Mutations in SYM7 (putative ortholog of NSP2, 'nodulation signaling pathway 2'), SYM11, and SYM14 genes resulted in considerable increase in root surface colonization and a substantial decrease in internal colonization as compared to corresponding wild-type pea lines (wt). In addition, the mutants sym7 and sym11 displayed a highly reduced amount of arbuscules. In contrast, plants mutated for the SYM34 gene displayed strongly reduced root surface colonization. The mutant sym34 also had strongly reduced internal colonization after 10 days of growth, but did not differ from wt 10 days later. The sym38 mutant did not differ from wt. These data indicate that all pea genes analyzed, except SYM38, are essential for both nodule and AM development. The phenotype of sym34 suggested that the pea SYM34 gene is an ortholog of the Medicago truncatula NSP1 ('nodulation signaling pathway 1'), and early stop codons were in fact detected in an NSP1 homologous sequence of two sym34 mutants. In addition, full co-segregation of the allelic states of a molecular marker representing a polymorphic fragment of the hypothetical pea NSP1 gene, together with the nodulation phenotype of 50 F-2 plants, support our hypothesis.

13506,Endophytes in New Zealand grass seeds: Occurrence and implications for conservation of grass species,"Grass seeds from 24 native species and 3 introduced, naturalised species were collected during the summer of 1999/2000 in New Zealand, mainly from the South Island. These species represented 12 grass genera. Of the native grasses, 19 are endemic. These seeds were examined for the presence of Epichloë or Neotyphodium endophytic fungi. No endophyte was detected in any of the 64 seed collections of native species. These included seven native Poa and two native Festuca species, and contrast with the common occurrence of endophytes in Northern Hemisphere and South American populations of these genera. This may be linked to the time of colonisation of these grasses by endophytes occurring after the isolation of New Zealand from continental populations, or low herbivore pressure (vertebrate and invertebrate) in New Zealand. No endophyte was found in Elymus recticetus, a naturalised grass species introduced from Australia. However, endophyte (E. festucae) was detected in 6 of the 20 naturalised Festuca ovina and F. rubra collections, of which 4 had 82–87% endophyte-infected seed. Endophyte is known to be widespread in roadside collections of the two agricultural species Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass) and Schedonorus phoenix (syn. F. arundinacea, tall fescue). Published records show that to date the only native New Zealand species known to contain endophyte is Echinopogon ovatus. Germplasm conservation of native grasses by seed, and the regimes required to maintain viable endophyte in such collections, needs to ensure that seed is stored between 0°C and -15°C, or at 5°C in aluminium laminated packaging. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Rolston M.P.; Stewart A.V.; Latch G.C.M.; Hume D.E.,New Zealand Journal of Botany,2002,10.1080/0028825X.2002.9512797,0.792045315960156,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995118578024605,0.00488142197539473,0.999999998580276,1.4197241160474e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
15178,"Isolation, identification and biocontrol efficacy of antagonistic endophyte strain Y-54 from anthurium; [红掌拮抗内生菌 Y-54 的分离、鉴定及其生防作用]","In order to screen endophytes with broad-spectrum antagonism, the endophytic strains with antagonistic effect to various pathogens were isolated and screened from healthy Anthurium andraeanum tissues with plate confrontation method. The antibacterial spectrum and antagonism of strain Y-54 were determined. It was identified based on morphological, physiological/biological and molecular biological characteristics. The growth promoting effect on A. andraeanum and the control efficacy on anthurium bacterial blight were measured with pot experiment. The results showed that 237 endophytic bacterial strains were isolated from healthy A. andraeanum. Strain Y-54 had the strongest antagonistic effect, and its 50 fold fermentation broth had the strongest inhibitory effect on Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. dieffenbachiae, with an inhibitory rate of 37.78%. At the same time, it had strong inhibitory effect on a variety of pathogenic fungi, among which the inhibitory rate on Cladosporium fulvum was 86.42%. Strain Y-54 was identified as Bacillus siamensis based on morphological, physiological, biochemical and molecular characteristics. The leaf length, leaf width and soil and plant analyzer development (SPAD) value of A. andraeanum were significantly increased by 50 fold fermentation broth of strain Y-54, and the control efficacy on Anthurium bacterial blight was 62.94% and 59.56% at 14 days and 28 days, respectively, which was similar to that of the agents used as controls. The results indicated that strain Y-54 had potential for development and application. © 2023 Editorial Board of Journal of Plant Protection.

2022,"Sapwood mycobiome varies across host, plant compartment and environments in Nothofagus forests from Northern Patagonia","Global forests are increasingly being threatened by altered climatic conditions and increased attacks by pests and pathogens. The complex ecological interactions among pathogens, microbial communities, tree hosts and the environment are important drivers of forest dynamics. Little is known about the ecology of forest pathology and related microbial communities in temperate forests of the southern hemisphere. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing to characterize sapwood-inhabiting fungal communities in North Patagonian Nothofagus forests and assessed patterns of diversity of taxa and ecological guilds across climatic, site and host variables (health condition and compartment) as a contribution to Nothofagus autecology. The diversity patterns inferred through the metabarcoding analysis were similar to those obtained through culture-dependent approaches. However, we detected additional heterogeneity and greater richness with culture-free methods. Host species was the strongest driver of fungal community structure and composition, while host health status was the weakest. The relative impacts of site, season, plant compartment and health status were different for each tree species; these differences can be interpreted as a matter of water availability. For Nothofagus dombeyi, which is distributed across a wide range of climatic conditions, site was the strongest driver of community composition. The microbiome of N. pumilio varied more with season and temperature, a relevant factor for forest conservation in the present climate change scenario. Both species carry a number of potential fungal pathogens in their sapwood, whether they exhibit symptoms or not. Our results provide insight into the diversity of fungi associated with the complex pathobiome of the dominant Nothofagus species in southern South America.","Molina, L; Rajchenberg, M; de Errasti, A; Vogel, B; Coetzee, MPA; Aime, MC; Pildain, MB",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2023,10.1111/mec.16771,0.925893452274691,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.989317144637783,0.0106828553622173,0.999707482560535,2.9251743946501e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Methods and Results Isolation, identification and characterization of novel endophytes producing cajanol from the roots of pigeon pea were investigated. The endophytes were identified as Hypocrea lixii by morphological and molecular methods. Cajanol produced by endophytes were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). R-18 produced the highest levels of cajanol (322 center dot 4 +/- 10 center dot 6gl-1 or 102 center dot 8 +/- 6 center dot 9gg-1 dry weight of mycelium) after incubation for 7days. The cytotoxicity towards human lung carcinoma cells (A549) of fungal cajanol was investigated in vitro. Conclusions First, a novel endophyte Hypocrea lixii, producing anticancer agent cajanol, was isolated from the host pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan [L.] Millsp.). Fungal cajanol possessed stronger cytotoxicity activity towards A549 cells in time- and dose-dependent manners. Significance and Impact of the Study This endophyte is a potential handle for scientific and commercial exploitation, and it could provide a promising alterative approach for large-scale production of cajanol to satisfy new anticancer drug development.","Zhao, J; Li, C; Wang, W; Zhao, C; Luo, M; Mu, F; Fu, Y; Zu, Y; Yao, M",JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY,2013,10.1111/jam.12195,0.795601835657414,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.971252276011098,0.0287477239889024,0.999999102336751,8.97663248511371e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
5410,Establishment of the fungal entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana as a season long endophyte in jute (Corchorus olitorius) and its rapid detection using SCAR marker,"An experiment was conducted to introduce the entomopathogen Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) as an endophyte in jute (Corchorus olitorius), a bast fibre crop through seed treatment. Colonization of root, leaf, stem, capsule, and seed were assessed through plating on selective medium and PCR based detection using B. bassiana specific SCAR markers. Endophytic colonization was detected in all the plants grown from treated seeds, but all the plant parts were not colonized. Colonization was detected in leaves, stems, and green capsules but not in roots and seeds. The endophytic colonization was influenced by both plant part and sampling period. Colonization was greater in leaves (55.87%) compared to stems (12.53%) and capsules (42.44%). The percent colonization was higher in case of 60 days old plants (43.34%) than in 30 days (23.89%) and 120 days (35.39%) old plants. As B. bassiana has already been reported to be pathogenic on jute pests, namely semilooper (Anomis sabulifera) and bihar hairy caterpillar (Spilosoma obliqua), its season long endophytic colonization within jute plant suggests a novel approach of biological control of these pests through seed treatment with the entomopathogen.","Biswas, C; Dey, P; Satpathy, S; Satya, P",BIOCONTROL,2012,10.1007/s10526-011-9424-0,0.691259570781654,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998537049439756,0.00146295056024399,0.999999995049073,4.9509273347681e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
1717,Phylogenic diversity of fungal endophytes in Spanish stands of Pinus halepensis,"Fungal endophytes were collected from 168 Pinus halepensis trees sampled in 55 Spanish stands. In total, 229 endophytic isolates were grouped into 92 morphotypes according to their mycelium features. Thus, twigs enclosed 63.76% of the total endophyte isolates and needles 36.24%. Likewise, twig samples also yielded a higher endophyte species richness. Analysis of ITS rDNA region generated 38 different Ascomycota taxa and confirmed the endophytic stage of several pathogens previously associated with the Pinus halepensis decline in Spain. Naemacyclus minor, Brunchorstia pinea, Lophodermium pinastri, Phomopsis sp., Diplodia pinea, Pestalotiopsis besseyi and Truncatella angustata were isolated. Sequencing of LSU rDNA region verified the 38 taxa and contributed to infer their phylogenic relatedness using the Neighbour-Joining method. In the bootstrap consensus tree five classes were observed. Dothideomycetes resulted to be the dominant class because of its high isolation frequency (52.4%) and richest species composition (39.5%). On the contrary, class Eurotiomycetes was the least abundant (3.5%) and along with class Pezizomycetes harboured the lowest species richness (7.9%). Class Sordariomycetes and Leotiomycetes had intermediate abundance and species composition percentages.

10712,Development of controlled release nanoformulations of carbendazim employing amphiphilic polymers and their bioefficacy evaluation against Rhizoctonia solani,"Controlled release nanoformulations of carbendazim (Methyl 1H-benzimidazol-2-ylcarbamate), a systemic fungicide, have been prepared using laboratory synthesized poly(ethylene glycols) (PEGs)-based functionalized amphiphilic copolymers. The release kinetics of carbendazim from developed controlled release (CR) formulations was studied and compared with that of the commercially available 50% Wettable Powder (WP). Further, the bioefficacy evaluation of developed formulations was done against plant pathogenic fungi Rhizoctonia solani by the poison food technique method. The release of maximum amount of carbendazim from developed formulations was dependent on the molecular weight of PEGs and was found to increase with increasing molecular weights. The range of carbendazim release was found to be between 10th to 35th day as compared to commercial formulation which was up to 7th day. The diffusion exponent (n value) of carbendazim in water ranged from 0.37 to 0.52 in the tested formulations. The half-release (t(1/2)) values ranged between 9.47 and 24.20days, and the period of optimum availability (POA) of carbendazim ranged from 9.15 to 26.63days. Also, ED50 values of the developed formulations vary from 0.40 to 0.74mg L-1. These formulations can be used to optimize the release of carbendazim to achieve disease control for the desired period depending on the matrix of the polymer used.","Koli, P; Singh, BB; Shakil, NA; Kumar, J; Kamil, D",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART B-PESTICIDES FOOD CONTAMINANTS AND AGRICULTURAL WASTES,2015,10.1080/03601234.2015.1038961,0.949068701841061,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.988581258785025,0.0114187412149748,0.999999996916341,3.0836592168626e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
775,Host associations and beta diversity of fungal endophyte communities in New Guinea rainforest trees,"Processes shaping the distribution of foliar fungal endophyte species remain poorly understood. Despite increasing evidence that these cryptic fungal symbionts of plants mediate interactions with pathogens and herbivores, there remain basic questions regarding the extent to which dispersal limitation and host specificity might shape fungal endophyte community composition in rainforests. To assess the relative importance of spatial pattern and host specificity, we isolated fungi from a sample of mapped trees in lowland Papua New Guinea. Sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region were obtained for 2079 fungal endophytes from three sites and clustered into molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) at 95% similarity. Multivariate analyses suggest that host affinity plays a significant role in structuring endophyte community composition whereas there was no evidence of endophyte spatial pattern at the scale of tens to hundreds of metres. Differences in endophyte communities between sampled trees were weakly correlated with variation in foliar traits but not with tree species relatedness. The dominance of relatively few generalist endophytes and the presence of a large number of rare MOTUs was a consistent observation at three sites separated by hundreds of kilometres and regional turnover was low. Host specificity appears to play a relatively weak but more important role than dispersal limitation in shaping the distribution of fungal endophyte communities in New Guinea forests. Our results suggest that in the absence of strong ecological gradients and host turnover, beta diversity of endophyte communities could be low in large areas of contiguous forest.","Vincent, JB; Weiblen, GD; May, G",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2016,10.1111/mec.13510,0.887913770678462,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999927192457869,7.28075421305626e-5,0.999999999005324,9.94675564136571e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
7563,An endophytic Fungi of Ginkgo biloba L. produces antimicrobial metabolites as potential inhibitors of FtsZ of Staphylococcus aureus,"A total of 58 fungal isolates, belonging to 24 genera, were obtained from the leaves, stems and roots of Ginkgo biloba L. Among them, one endophytic fungal strain, Penicillium cataractum SYPF 7131, displayed the strongest antibacterial activity. Four new compounds (1-4) were isolated from the strain fermentation broth together with four known compounds (5-8). These structures were determined on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR and [Rh-2(OCOCF3)(4)]-induced electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopic analyses. All the isolated compounds were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities. Compound 3 and 4 showed moderate inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Compound 7 exhibited significant inhibitory activity against S. aureus with MIC value of 10 mu g/mL. Further, the in silico molecular docking studies of the active compounds was used to explore the binding interactions with the active site of filamentous temperature-sensitive protein Z (FtsZ) from Staphylococcus aureus. The docking results revealed that compounds 3, 4 and 7 showed high binding energies, strong H-bond interactions and hydrophobic interactions with FtsZ from S. aureus validating the observed antimicrobial activity.

2775,Interaction between endophytic Proteobacteria strains and Serendipita indica enhances biocontrol activity against fungal pathogens,"Aims Plants host communities of fungal and bacterial endophytes, establishing a complex network of multipartite interactions, but the mechanisms whereby they interact are poorly understood. Some fungi, such as the beneficial mycorrhiza-like fungus Serendipita (=Piriformospora) indica, can be helped by bacteria for establishment, survival and colonization. Although this fungus harbors a Rhizobium as an endofungal bacterium, we hypothesized that other bacteria might also establish associations with the fungus and combining S. indica with bacteria might enhance plant growth and health. Methods The interactions among S. indica and four endophytic Proteobacteria belonging to Methylobacterium, Tardiphaga, Rhodanobacter and Trinickia spp. were characterized in vitro and for their effect on tomato growth and biocontrol of Fusarium oxysporum and Rhizoctonia solani. Possible mechanisms behind these interactions were described based on genome and microscopic analyses, using fungal and bacterial strains tagged with fluorescent markers. Results All bacteria stimulated S. indica growth in vitro. Moreover, several of the bacteria stimulated growth of tomato plants, but co-inoculations with S. indica and bacteria did not perform better than single inoculations. Contrarily, combinations of S. indica and bacteria significantly reduced disease progression of fungal pathogens. These microbes seem to cooperate in the process of root colonization for instance by increasing fungal sporulation and hyphae expansion, showing multipartite interaction between microbes and plants. Interestingly, the strain of Trinickia internally colonizes spores of S. indica as an endofungal bacterium during in vitro-co-culturing, suggesting further that the fungus might acquire formerly unrecognized genera of bacteria and genome analysis of the bacteria revealed many genes potentially involved in fungal and plant growth stimulation, biocontrol and root colonization, highlighting putative mechanisms of plant-fungal-bacterial interaction. Conclusions Our study represents an important step towards unraveling the complex interactions among plants, S. indica, endophytic bacteria and fungal pathogens, and indicates that adding bacteria to fungal inoculum could have a remarkable impact on the plant-S. indica symbiosis.","del Barrio-Duque, A; Samad, A; Nybroe, O; Antonielli, L; Sessitsch, A; Compant, S",PLANT AND SOIL,2020,10.1007/s11104-020-04512-5,0.954468702742164,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.988429465843437,0.0115705341565634,0.999999931723428,6.82765717296974e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2172,Heterobasidiomycetes form symbiotic associations with hepatics:: Jungermanniales have sebacinoid mycobionts while Aneura pinguis (Metzgeriales) is associated with a Tulasnella species,"In order to evaluate substrate dependence of the symbiotic fungal associations in leafy liverworts (Jungermanniopsida), 28 species Out of 12 families were investigated by transmission electron microscopy and molecular methods. Samples were obtained from the diverse substrates: from naked soil, from the forest floor on needle litter, from between peat moss. from rotten bark of standing trees, and from stumps and rotten wood. Associations with ascomycetes were found in most of the specimens independent from the substrate. Seven species sampled from soil were found to contain basidiomycete hyphae. Ultrastructure consistently showed dolipores with imperforate parenthesomes. Molecular phylogenetic studies revealed that three specimens belonging to the Jungermanniales were associated with members of Sebacinaceae, while Aneura pinguis (Metzgeriales) was associated with a Tulasnella species. These taxa are so far the only basidiomycetes known to be symbiotically associated with leafy liverworts. The probability that the associations with Sebacinaceae are evolutionary old, but the Tulasnella associations more derived is discussed. The sebacinoid mycobionts form a similar interaction type with the jungermannialian leafy liverworts as do the associated ascomycetes. The term 'jungermannioid mycorrhiza' is proposed for this distinctive symbiotic interaction type.","Kottke, I; Beiter, A; Weiss, M; Haug, I; Oberwinkler, F; Nebel, M",MYCOLOGICAL RESEARCH,2003,10.1017/S0953756203008141,0.899384997934664,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990486308987233,0.00951369101276717,0.999999997046871,2.9531286305228803e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

10256,Impact of salicylic acid- and jasmonic acid-regulated defences on root colonization by Trichoderma harzianum T-78,"We recently found that the beneficial fungus Trichoderma harzianum T-78 primes tomato plants for salicylic acid (SA)-and jasmonic acid (JA)-regulated defenses, resulting in enhanced resistance against the root knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita. By using SA-and JA-impaired mutant lines and exogenous hormonal application, here we investigated whether the SA-and JA-pathways also have a role in T-78 root colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana. Endophytic colonization by T-78 was faster in the SA-impaired mutant sid2 than in the wild type. Moreover, elicitation of SA-dependent defenses by SA application reduced T-78 colonization, indicating that the SA-pathway affects T-78 endophytism. In contrast, elicitation of the JA-pathway, which antagonized SA-dependent defenses, resulted in enhanced endophytic colonization by T-78. These findings are in line with our previous observation that SA-dependent defenses are repressed by T-78, which likely aids colonization by the endophytic fungus.","Martínez-Medina, A; Appels, FVW; van Wees, SCM",PLANT SIGNALING & BEHAVIOR,2017,10.1080/15592324.2017.1345404,0.987335519936421,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.97633832825833,0.0236616717416704,0.999999468286053,5.31713947093948e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Surface disinfection method was applied to isolate the endophytic fungi from P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis rhizome. CMC plate assay was used to detect the cellulase activity of the isolated strains. Morphological features and sequence characters based techniques were applied to identify the strains producing high-yield cellulase. The factors affecting the cellulase activity were also explored. Finally,plate activity screen method was used to test the activity of other extracellular hydrolases production. A total of 41 fungal endophytes were isolated from 3 origins of P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis. Among the 41 isolates,strains named as AS-5,AS-7,AS-9 and AS-18 were found to be able to produce cellulase,and strain AS-9 showed the strongest cellulase production activity. AS-9 was identified as Setophoma terrestris based on the morphological observations and ITS,LSU sequences analysis. AS-9 presented maximal cellulase activity at pH7.0 and 28℃. UV exposure did not have a significant effect on cellulase production of AS9. Meanwhile,S. terrestris AS-9 also demonstrated the activities of producing caseinase,lipase,asparaginase,glutaminase and urease production.

16241,Assessment of Chinese Medicinal Herbal Wastes Compost Inoculated with Antagonistic Fungi: Nitrogen Retention and Microbial Community in Phytopathogenic Soil,"More and more non-medicinal wastes produced during the planting and processing of Chinese herbal medicine caused serious pollution. How to use these wastes efficiently and reasonably has become a popular topic with great interest. In this text, a new strain of antagonistic fungi Aspergillus niger was isolated from the root of the antimicrobial herb rhubarb, and the effect of its inoculation in Chinese medicinal herbal wastes (CMHWs) composting was investigated. Results suggested that the addition of CMHWs and A. niger could accelerate the composting process, improve the total N (TN) content (3.9%), the germination index (GI) value (132%) and the antibacterial activity against the phytopathogen Pectobacterium carotovorum (P. carotovorum) (zone of inhibition, 14.3 mm). Potting experiments suggested that a 15% dose of compost promotes the Chinese cabbage plant growth, and increases the soil TN content (0.3097%), and OM (organic matter, 74.49%), as well as the enzyme activities in the phytopathogen-contaminated rhizosphere soil. The abundance of soil Proteobacteria in compost treatments (38.2%-54.3%) was significantly higher. The highest relative abundance of Aspergillus, Pichia, and Fusarium in phytopathogen soil increased dramatically for the compost treatment, accounting for more than 65% of the microbial sequences at the fungal genus level. Redundancy analysis showed that the OM and TN were positively correlated with the Proteobacteria, Aspergillus and Fusarium, etc. Therefore, the CMHWs compost inoculated with endogenous fungi A. niger has great potential application in the waste resource utilization of Chinese herbal medicine and restoration of alkaline phytopathogenic soil. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Cao L.; Wang L.; Qi Y.; Li Z.; Wang M.; Zhang H.; Wang Z.; Lu H.; Kang S.; Song L.; Ma Z.,"Water, Air, and Soil Pollution",2024,10.1007/s11270-024-07534-2,0.975586304998794,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.859383546658412,0.140616453341588,0.99857465220831,0.00142534779169046,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
539,Leaf surface traits: overlooked determinants of birch resistance to herbivores and foliar micro-fungi?,"Previous studies on the mechanisms of birch resistance to herbivores and foliar micro-fungi (both pathogenic and endophytic) have focused mainly on the role of internal leaf chemistry. In the present study, we examined genetic correlations between leaf surface traits (glandular trichome density and total concentrations of surface flavonoid aglycones) and occurrence of three species of foliar micro-fungi, one pathogenic rust (Melampsoridium betulinum) and two endophytic fungi (Fusicladium sp. and Melanconium sp.), and performance of autumnal moth larvae (Epirrita autumnata) in two birch species, Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii and B. pendula. The performance of autumnal moth larvae on B. pubescens ssp. czerepanovii was negatively correlated with density of glandular trichomes (RGR: r=-0.855; pupal mass: r=-0.709). In addition, rust infection was negatively correlated with trichome density in B. pendula (r=-0.675) and with epicuticular flavonoid aglycones in B. pubescens ssp. czerepanovii (r=-0.855). The frequency of the endophytic fungus Fusicladium sp., was related to epicuticular flavonoid aglycones (r=-0.782), while another endophytic fungus, Melanconium sp., showed no associations with any of the studied variables in B. pubescens ssp. czerepanovii. Our results indicate that leaf surface traits may be at least as important determinants of herbivore performance and micro-fungi abundance in birch as leaf internal chemistry.","Valkama, E; Koricheva, J; Salminen, JP; Helander, M; Saloniemi, I; Saikkonen, K; Pihlaja, K",TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION,2005,10.1007/s00468-004-0380-5,0.944697565860117,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999264450950888,7.3554904911164e-4,0.999999999935782,6.421818632418309e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

These compounds impart organoleptic properties to saffron (dried stigmas of Crocus flower) making it world's costliest spice. Crocus apocarotenoids have tremendous medicinal properties as well. Effect of endophytes on Crocus apocarotenoid production and the molecular mechanism involved has not been reported so far. Here we studied the effect of an oleaginous fungal endophyte, Mortierella alpina CS10E4 on Crocus growth, apocarotenoid metabolism and tolerance to corm rot disease. The results demonstrated that there was a significant improvement in many morphological and physiological traits in endophyte treated Crocus plants including total biomass and size of corms, stigma biomass, number of apical sprouting buds, and number of adventitious roots. The endophyte also shifted metabolic flux towards enhanced production of apocarotenoids by modulating the expression of key pathway genes. Further, M. alpina CS10E4 enhanced tolerance to corm rot disease by releasing arachidonic acid which acts as conserved defense signal and induces jasmonic acid production in endophyte treated Crocus corms. This is first report on effect of a fungal endophyte on Crocus apocarotenoid metabolism and stress tolerance.","Wani, ZA; Kumar, A; Sultan, P; Bindu, K; Riyaz-Ul-Hassan, S; Ashraf, N",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2017,10.1038/s41598-017-08974-z,0.976152785126848,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993489573985601,0.00651042601439917,0.999999882319837,1.17680162836642e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16568,"Variation among Angus cows in response to endophyte-infected fescue seed in the diet, as related to their past calf production.","Production of 18, 12-yr-old Angus cows was summarized as the averaged weaning weight deviations of each cow's calves from their like-aged, like-sexed and similarly managed contemporaries. These cows had spent a large part of their productive lives on pastures dominated by endophyte-infected tall fescue, so differences among them in calf production might have been induced partly by differences in susceptibility to fescue toxicosis. Cows were divided randomly into two groups for a 31-d summer feeding trial. In a crossover design, cows were fed 0 or .9 kg per cow per day of endophyte-infected fescue seed. Various traits were monitored to quantify differences among cows in response to the endophyte-infected fescue seed. Baseline serum prolactin concentration was depressed by fescue seed feeding, but differences among cows in the amount of depression were not related to past calf production. Prolactin release in response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone tended to be depressed by fescue, but the response also was sensitive to factors such as ambient temperature. Serum cholesterol and body weight change did not respond significantly to the fescue challenge. The experiment was not successful in unambiguously differentiating among cows in susceptibility to fescue toxicosis or in relating differential susceptibility to past calf production.",Hohenboken WD; Berggren-Thomas PL; Beal WE; McClure WH,Journal of animal science,1991,10.2527/1991.69185x,0.860610888794799,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.956181287419257,0.0438187125807427,0.999997341751292,2.6582487081539e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

16608,The root cap and control of root elongation in Zea mays L. seedlings exposed to white light.,"Light-induced inhibition of the elongation of primary roots of Zea mays seedlings is dependent upon the perception of light by the root cap. Separate exposure of detached root caps and roots from which root caps have been removed (i.e. decapped roots) to white light or darkness has shown that the elongation of a dark-exposed root to which a light-exposed root cap is attached is inhibited significantly, whilst a light-exposed decapped root to which a dark-exposed root cap is attached is not inhibited. Thus the decapped root is not capable of perceiving the growth-inhibitory stimulus of white light and its rate of elongation is greater than that of light-exposed roots with root caps still intact. However, the capacity to perceive light and, therefore, to be inhibited by it, is restored to the decapped root approximately 5 h after removal of the root cap.Abscisic acid and two unidentified growth-inhibiting compounds are present in the root caps of light-grown but not of dark-grown Zea mays seedlings and a period of 2.5-3.0 h is required for transport of the compounds, in levels effective in growth inhibition, from the root cap into the apex of the root.",Wilkins H; Wain RL,Planta,1974,10.1007/BF00384000,0.898935519741139,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.961941131305172,0.0380588686948279,0.999997715315822,2.28468417795558e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
17202,"Impact of swapping soils on the endophytic bacterial communities of pre-domesticated, ancient and modern maize.","Endophytes are microbes that live within plants such as maize (corn, Zea mays L.) without causing disease. It is generally assumed that most endophytes originate from soil. If this is true, then as humans collected, domesticated, bred and migrated maize globally from its native Mexico, they moved the species away from its native population of endophyte donors. The migration of maize persists today, as breeders collect wild and exotic seed (as sources of diverse alleles) from sites of high genetic diversity in Mexico for breeding programs on distant soils. When transported to new lands, it is unclear whether maize permits only selective colonization of microbes from the Mexican soils on which it co-evolved, tolerates shifts in soil-derived endophytes, or prevents colonization of soil-based microbes in favour of seed-transmitted microbes. To test these hypotheses, non-sterilized seeds of three types of maize (pre-domesticated-Mexican, ancient-Mexican, modern-temperate) were planted side-by-side on indigenous Mexican soil, Canadian temperate soil or sterilized sand. The impact of these soil swaps on founder bacterial endophyte communities was tested using 16S-rDNA profiling, culturing and microbial trait phenotyping. Multivariate analysis showed that bacterial 16S-rDNA TRFLP profiles from young, surface-sterilized maize plants were more similar when the same host genotype was grown on the different soils than when different maize genotypes were grown on the same soil. There appeared to be two reasons for this result. First, the largest fraction of bacterial 16S-signals from soil-grown plants was shared with parental seeds and/or plants grown on sterilized sand, suggesting significant inheritance of candidate endophytes. The in vitro activities of soil-derived candidate endophytes could be provided by bacteria that were isolated from sterile sand grown plants. Second, many non-inherited 16S-signals from sibling plants grown on geographically-distant soils were shared with one another, suggesting maize can select microbes with similar TRFLP peak sizes from diverse soils. Wild, pre-domesticated maize did not possess more unique 16S-signals when grown on its native Mexican soil than on Canadian soil, pointing against long-term co-evolutionary selection. The modern hybrid did not reject more soil-derived 16S-signals than did ancestral maize, pointing against such rejection as a mechanism that contributes to yield stability across environments. A minor fraction of 16S-signals was uniquely associated with any one soil. Within the limits of TRFLP profiling, the candidate bacterial endophyte populations of pre-domesticated, ancient and modern maize are partially buffered against the effects of geographic migration --- from a Mexican soil associated with ancestral maize, to a Canadian soil associated with modern hybrid agriculture. These results have implications for understanding the effects of domestication, migration, ex situ seed conservation and modern breeding, on the microbiome of one of the world's most important food crops.",Johnston-Monje D; Mousa WK; Lazarovits G; Raizada MN,BMC plant biology,2014,10.1186/s12870-014-0233-3,0.964280384494363,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99990500525465,9.4994745350451e-5,0.999999502672002,4.97327998449926e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The stevia plant verified by BSI, Kolkata, is the Stevia rebaudiana (Bertoni) Bertoni. Isolation and its characterization of fungal endophytes showed the microscopic structure and diversity. A molecular taxonomic of fungal endophytic isolate (SC0T5) was done using an 18 s rRNA primer sequence, and it was found to be the Aspergillus versicolor strain PSFNRO-2, accession number HQ393875.1. Its phylogenetic tree was made using the BLAST sequence regenerated based on the closest nucleotide homology. The extract obtained from extracting the fungal culture using ethyl acetate was centrifuged, and the pellet dissolved in methanol was studied analytically using UHPLC profiling. The chromatogram of the standard compound, Aspergillus versicolor strain PSFNRO-2, were studied, and their retention time was 1.837 min and 1.822 min, respectively. The peak area curve of Aspergillus versicolor strain PSFNRO-2 is 19.8 mAU. The equation obtained from the standard graph was further used to quantify stevioside concentration in Aspergillus versicolor strain PSFNRO-2, found to contain 1.1 mg/ml which is 2-fold higher stevioside production than in vitro shoot (0.411 mg/ml) and in vivo leaf (0.52 mg/ml) and 1.5-fold higher stevioside production than plan stem (0.88 mg/ml). ESI-MS profiling of stevioside and Aspergillus versicolor strain PSFNRO-2 have almost the same mass of 803.40 m/z and 803.56 m/z, respectively. (c) 2025 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Methods The isolation, culture, and identification of microorganism, and plant cell suspension culture technology were adopted; And relative data were analyzed by the statistical methods. Results In four producing areas, 116 strains were isolated and classified into eight genera. The dominant populations were Fusarium LK. ex FR., Geotrichum LK., and Alternaria Nees. The population structure of endophytic fungi obviously changed at the different growing phases. Species and quantity of endophytic fungi were plentiful at the seedling stage and bud stage, and especially at the bud stage the isolation rate and isolation frequency were more than 30% and 19%, respectively. Some endophytic fungi had the obvious area and tissue specificity. Compared with the control by adding the elicitor of Fusarium sp. 3, the yields of cell biomass and polysaccharide were increased to 31. 86% and 38. 01 %, respectively.

18962,Halotolerant Endophytic Bacteria Priestia flexa 7BS3110 with Hg2+ Tolerance Isolated from Avicennia germinans in a Caribbean Mangrove from Colombia.,"The mangrove ecosystems of the Department of Atlántico (Colombian Caribbean) are seriously threatened by problems of hypersalinization and contamination, especially by heavy metals from the Magdalena River. The mangrove plants have developed various mechanisms to adapt to these stressful conditions, as well as the associated microbial populations that favor their growth. In the present work, the tolerance and detoxification capacity to heavy metals, especially to mercury, of a halotolerant endophytic bacterium isolated from the species Avicennia germinans located in the Balboa Swamp in the Department of Atlántico was characterized. Diverse microorganisms were isolated from superficially sterilized A. germinans leaves. Tolerance to NaCl was evaluated for each of the obtained isolates, and the most resistant was selected to assess its tolerance to Pb2+, Cu2+, Hg2+, Cr3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+, many of which have been detected in high concentrations in the area of study. According to the ANI and AAI percentages, the most halotolerant strain was identified as Priestia flexa, named P. flexa 7BS3110, which was able to tolerate up to 12.5% (w/v) NaCl and presented a minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.25 mM for Hg, 10 mM for Pb, and 15 mM for Cr3+. The annotation of the P. flexa 7BS3110 genome revealed the presence of protein sequences associated with exopolysaccharide (EPS) production, thiol biosynthesis, specific proteins for chrome efflux, non-specific proteins for lead efflux, and processes associated with sulfur and iron homeostasis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis showed morphological cellular changes and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed an electrodense extracellular layer when exposed to 0.25 mM Hg2+. Due to the high tolerance of P. flexa 7BS3110 to Hg2+ and NaCl, its ability to grow when exposed to both stressors was tested, and it was able to thrive in the presence of 5% (w/v) NaCl and 0.25 mM of Hg2+.

5163,Analysis of Whole-Genome for Alternaria Species Identification,"The genus Alternaria, functioning as a saprobe, endophyte, and plant pathogen, is widely distributed across various natural and human-impacted environments. Leaf spot and black spot diseases, caused by Alternaria species, are the most prevalent plant diseases within this genus, leading to significant reductions in crop yields and substantial economic losses. To facilitate the timely detection of Alternaria species during the early stages of infection, enable targeted treatments, and mitigate associated damages, we employed a species identification method based on Analysis of whole-GEnome (AGE). We downloaded 148 genomes, including 31 Alternaria species, from the NCBI GenBank database. Through bioinformatics analysis, we constructed a specific-target sequence library and selected a representative sequence per species. The specific target sequences of the seven exemplary Alternaria species were subsequently used for validation and rapid detection, utilizing Sanger sequencing and CRISPR-Cas12a technology, respectively. The results demonstrated that our method accurately identified the target species. Additionally, by combining Enzymatic Recombinase Amplification (ERA) with CRISPR-Cas12a, we achieved rapid and precise identification of genomic DNA samples, with a detection limit as low as 0.01 ng/mu L within 30 min. Therefore, AGE proves to be a highly robust and efficient method for the detection of Alternaria species, offering broad potential for various applications.","Yang, Y; Gan, YT; Xu, WJ; Huang, YH; Xin, TY; Tan, R; Song, JY",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2025,10.3390/jof11030185,0.971209530510038,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990461285159414,0.00953871484058641,0.999999980277841,1.9722158794977e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11489,A mutualistic interaction between a fungivorous nematode and a fungus within the endophytic community of Bromus tectorum,"In its invaded range in western North America, Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) can host more than 100 sequence-based, operational taxonomic units of endophytic fungi, of which an individual plant hosts a subset. Research suggests that the specific subset is determined by plant genotype, environment, dispersal of locally available endophytes, and mycorrhizal associates. But, interactions among members of the endophyte community could also be important. In a sampling of 63 sites throughout the invaded range of B. tectorum, a fungivorous nematode, Paraphelenchus acontioides, and an endophyte, Fusarium cf. torulosum, were found together in two sites. This positive co-occurrence in the field led to an experimental investigation of their interaction and its effects on relative abundances within the endophyte community. In greenhouse and laboratory experiments, we determined first that P. acontioides preferred F. cf. torulosum to other endophytes, and secondly that the relative abundance of F. cf. torulosum within the endophyte community was increased by the nematode in experimental plants. Taken together our results suggest that the fungivorous P. acontioides uses living plants to cultivate or increase the relative abundance of its preferred fungus. Surprisingly, host plant growth was unaffected by this endophytic, cultivation-based mutualism between a nematode and a fungus. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

5159,Management of Black Root Disease-Causing Fungus Fusarium solani CRP1 by Endophytic Bacillus siamensis CNE6 through Its Metabolites and Activation of Plant Defense Genes,"Black root rot disease of Cicer arietinum L. is accountable for substantial loss in chickpea production worldwide. Endophytic Bacillus siamensis CNE6 has previously shown multifaceted plant growth-promoting, broad-spectrum antifungal, and chickpea plant-colonizing potential. In the present study, the strain Bacillus siamensis CNE6 was used for controlling black root rot disease caused by Fusarium solani CRP1 in chickpea. CNE6 showed strong antagonistic potential against CRP1 both in vivo and in vitro. Scanning electron microscopic studies indicated cellular deformation of CRP1 due to production of beta-glucanase, protease, and other secondary metabolites. A total of five compounds were detected from the cell-free supernatant (CFS) of the ethyl acetate (EA) fraction of CNE6 through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. A confocal microscopic study demonstrated strong inhibition of biofilm formation of the pathogen CRP1 by the EA fraction of CFS of CNE6. Molecular docking analysis revealed that one compound, (2E)-6-methoxy-2-[(4-methoxyphenyl)methylidene]-2,3-dihydro-1-benzofuran-3-one, may inhibit the activity of lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase, which is involved in ergosterol biosynthesis and beta-tubulin assembling. In vivo experiments also showed the efficacy of CNE6 for increasing chickpea growth as well as upregulation of four defense genes (CHI1, PAMP, PR2B, and TF1082) upon pathogenic challenge. Thus, our results strongly suggest a positive role for CNE6 as a prospective biocontrol agent for combating Fusarium solani in chickpea. IMPORTANCE The present work was undertaken to explore an effective biocontrol agent against the destructive black root rot disease of chickpea. We have used an efficient bacterial endophyte, CNE6, which can colonize in the chickpea root system, produce secondary metabolites and enzymes to degrade pathogenic cellular integrity, inhibit pathogenic establishment by rupturing biofilm formation, and induce host immunity upon treatment. Interaction of the bacterial metabolite was also observed with lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase, which is an important component in fungal membrane functioning. Being an endophyte, Bacillus siamensis CNE6 fulfills a suitable criterion as a biocontrol agent to control black root rot disease in chickpea and has huge prospects for use commercially.","Gorai, PS; Ghosh, R; Ghosh, S; Samanta, S; Sen, A; Panja, S; Gond, SK; Mandal, NC",MICROBIOLOGY SPECTRUM,2023,10.1128/spectrum.03082-22,0.860714977433395,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.890926073972094,0.109073926027906,0.999999933684437,6.63155629299084e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
12705,Enhanced nodulation of peanut when co-inoculated with fungal endophyte Phomopsis liquidambari and bradyrhizobium,"In peanut continuous cropping soil, the application of fungal endophyte Phomopsis liquidambari B3 showed peanut pod yield promotion and root nodule number increase. P. liquidambari improved soil environment by degrading allelochemicals and thus promoted peanut pod yield. Furthermore, peanut yield promotion is in part due to the root nodule increase since nodular nitrogen fixation provides the largest source of nitrogen for peanut. However, it is unknown whether this nodule number increase is induced by fungal endophyte. We therefore conducted several pot experiments using vermiculite to investigate the effects of P. liquidambari on peanut-bradyrhizobium nodulation. Our results showed that P. liquidambari co-inoculated with bradyrhizobium increased root nodule number and shoot accumulated nitrogen by 28.25% and 29.71%, respectively. Nodulation dynamics analysis showed that P. liquidambari accelerated nodule initiation and subsequent nodule development. Meanwhile, P. liquidambari was able to colonize the peanut root as an endophyte. The dynamics of P. liquidambari and bradyrhizobial root colonization analysis showed that P. liquidambari inoculation significantly increased the rate of bradyrhizobial colonization. Furthermore, P. liquidambari inoculation significantly increased flavonoids synthesis-related enzymes activities, two common types of flavonoid (luteolin and quercetin-peanut rhizobial nod gene inducer) secretion and lateral root (peanut rhizobial infection site) formation, indicating that P. liquidambari altered the peanut nodulation-related physiological and metabolic activities. These obtained results confirmed the direct contribution of P. liquidambari in enhancing peanut-bradyrhizobium interaction, nodulation and yield. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

1877,Plant roots send metabolic signals to microbes in response to long-term overgrazing,"Overgrazing directly and indirectly affects soil microorganisms, which can have feedback effects on plant growth. Little is known about the root metabolites plants produce and whether they recruit beneficial microbes in response to overgrazing. Here, we used the dominant grassland species Leymus chinensis to explore correlations between root metabolites and the rhizosphere microbiome shaped by long-term overgrazing, which was determined by using LC-MS technology and high-throughput sequencing. In total, 839 metabolites were detected, with 41 significantly higher and 3 significantly lower in overgrazing versus grazing exclusion plots. The rhizosphere bacterial community was changed, but the fungal community was not altered. Moreover, 11 bacterial orders were found only in the overgrazed samples, and these showed close relationships to root metabolites and certain soil properties. Of these, Latescibacterales, B10SB3A, and Nitrosococcales are known to be involved in growth promotion, C and N metabolism, respectively. In addition, root metabolites play an important role in mediating root-fungi interactions. The beneficial fungal orders Agaricales and Sordariales have a tread to be higher maybe due to root metabolites, mainly facilitate nutrient absorption and protect organic carbon in the soil, respectively. Our results indicate that grassland plants send metabolic signals to recruit key beneficial bacteria and stabilize fungal communities to alleviate grazing-induced stress in typical grassland ecosystems.","Jingjing, Y; Huiqin, G; Fry, EL; De Long, JR; Shiming, T; Ting, Y; Weibo, R",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156241,0.88796787269645,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.876925415094356,0.123074584905644,0.999835565469163,1.6443453083681e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
2534,Populations of the Parasitic PlantPhelipanche ramosaInfluence Their Seed Microbiota,"Seeds of the parasitic weedPhelipanche ramosaare well adapted to their hosts because they germinate and form haustorial structures to connect to roots in response to diverse host-derived molecular signals.P. ramosapresents different genetic groups that are preferentially adapted to certain hosts. Since there are indications that microbes play a role in the interaction especially in the early stages of the interaction, we studied the microbial diversity harbored by the parasitic seeds with respect to their host and genetic group. Twenty-six seed lots from seven cropping plots of three different hosts-oilseed rape, tobacco, and hemp-in the west of France were characterized for their bacterial and fungal communities using 16S rRNA gene and ITS (Internal transcribed spacer) sequences, respectively. First seeds were characterized genetically using twenty microsatellite markers and phenotyped for their sensibility to various germination stimulants including strigolactones and isothiocyanates. This led to the distinction of threeP. ramosagroups that corresponded to their host of origin. The observed seed diversity was correlated to the host specialization and germination stimulant sensitivity withinP. ramosaspecies. Microbial communities were both clustered by host and plot of origin. The seed core microbiota was composed of seventeen species that were also retrieved from soil and was in lower abundances for bacteria and similar abundances for fungi compared to seeds. The host-related core microbiota of parasitic seeds was limited and presumably well adapted to the interaction with its hosts. Two microbial candidates ofSphingobacteriumspecies andLeptosphaeria maculanswere especially identified in seeds from oilseed rape plots, suggesting their involvement in host recognition and specialization as well as seed fitness forP. ramosaby improving the production of isothiocyanates from glucosinolates in the rhizosphere of oilseed rape.","Huet, S; Pouvreau, JB; Delage, E; Delgrange, S; Marais, C; Bahut, M; Delavault, P; Simier, P; Poulin, L",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2020,10.3389/fpls.2020.01075,0.992935366452193,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.982229997262629,0.0177700027373706,0.999999999999946,5.4067861299245105e-14,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
13751,Effects of feeding Kentucky 31 tall fescue seed infected with acremonium coenophialum to laboratory rats.,"An endophytic fungus found in Kentucky 31 (KY-31) tall fescue has been associated with the ""summer syndrome"" (fescue toxicity) in grazing cattle. Four experiments were conducted to investigate the use of weanling rats as an animal model to study the fescue toxicity syndrome. When graded levels of fungus-infected (INF) or fungus-free (FF) KY-31 seed were fed, feed intake and growth rates were inversely related to the amount of INF seed in the diet. When diets containing 50% seed were fed, rats eating INF seed had reduced (P less than .05) daily water consumption (9 vs 20 ml) and lowered (P less than .05) body temperatures (36.8 vs 37.7 C) when compared with the FF treatments. Autoclaving the seed increased feed intake and growth rate of rats receiving both INF and FF seed diets, but daily gains continued to be less (P less than .05) in the rats fed autoclaved INF diets when compared with rats fed autoclaved FF diets (2.3 vs 6.8 g). Rats fed diets containing either 40% shredded wheat on which the fescue endophyte had been grown or 40% shredded wheat that was not innoculated did not differ in performance. Crude fiber, nitrogen-free extract, gross energy and dry matter digestibilities were enhanced (P less than .05) by the presence of INF seed in the diets when compared with the FF seed treatments. Crude protein and ether extract digestibilities and apparent biological value of fescue protein were not affected by presence of the fungus. The effect of INF seed on organ weights was inconsistent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Neal W.D.; Schmidt S.P.,Journal of animal science,1985,10.2527/jas1985.613603x,0.928419519493757,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993731380229321,0.00626861977067861,0.999999813944934,1.86055066353497e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3157,Transcriptome analyses reveal Beauveria bassiana endophyte induced disruption of aphid physiology,"Some strains of entomopathogenic fungi are known to colonize crops endophytically, providing systemic protection against insect pests. This colonization has been revealed to reduce aphid survival and reproductive potential. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects could provide insight into what occurs to aphids when they feed on endophytically colonized plants. In this study, an RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted for transcriptome analyses of the melon aphid Aphis gossypii and its symbiotic bacteria after feeding on Beauveria bassiana endophytically colonized melon plants. The fungal colonization triggers significant alterations in the aphid transcriptome, reflecting molecular responses to fungal propagules and/or plant-induced systemic resistance. Key changes include the up-regulation of genes involved in host plant recognition by the aphid pest, immune system activation, energy production, and defense mechanisms such as toxin adaptation, detoxification, and cell death markers. Genes associated with escape responses, including alarm pheromone production and wing bud differentiation, were also up-regulated. In contrast, down-regulated genes point to disruptions in homeostasis and neuronal function, further impacting aphid physiology and its symbiotic relationship with Buchnera. These molecular perturbations likely underlie the lethal and sublethal effects observed in aphids feeding on B. bassiana-colonized plants. This study identifies critical pathways involved in aphid-fungal-plant interactions, offering valuable insights into the potential of endophytic entomopathogenic fungi for aphid pest management.","María, CM; Jose, VD; Adrián, PR; Enrique, QM; Natalia, GM",JOURNAL OF INVERTEBRATE PATHOLOGY,2025,10.1016/j.jip.2025.108377,0.955250001854477,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.600091721715657,0.399908278284343,0.999992898296069,7.10170393114495e-6,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

16127,Microbiome Analysis of Area in Proximity to White Spot Lesions Reveals More Harmful Plant Pathogens in Maize,"Plant microbiomes play a major role in plant health, growth, and development, enhancing resistance to pathogen invasion. However, despite the extensive research on the phyllosphere microbiome, it remains unclear how the microbiome of leaves in proximity to diseased leaves responds to pathogen invasion. We investigate the response of the maize phyllosphere microbiome to maize white spot by assessing the microbiome dynamics associated with the white spot portion and the area in proximity using 16S and ITS high-throughput sequencing analysis. Our results showed that the bacterial diversities were higher in the diseased portion and area in proximity to the spot than those in healthy plants. At the same time, lower fungal diversity was recorded in the diseased portion compared to portions in proximity to it and healthy leaves. The spot portion had a significant influence on the microbial composition. The diseased portion, the area in proximity to it, and the healthy leaves were dominated by the bacterial genera Sphingomonas, Delftia, Chryseobacterium, Stenotrophomonas, Methylobacterium-methylorubrum, and Bacteroides. Still, the abundance of Sphingomonas decreased in the healthy leaves with a corresponding increase in Stenotrophomonas. Conversely, the fungal genus Setophoma dominated the diseased portion, while the fungal pathogens Cladosporium, Alternaria, and Exserohilum were highly abundant in the samples from the area in proximity to it. In addition, a co-occurrence network analysis revealed a complex fungal network in healthy leaves and those in proximity to leaves infected with white spot compared to the diseased portion. This study suggests that the area in proximity to the maize leaf infected with white spot disease is colonized by more harmful plant pathogenic fungi for disease progression. © 2025 by the authors.",Jibril S.M.; Hu Y.; Yang K.; Wu J.; Li C.; Wang Y.,Biomolecules,2025,10.3390/biom15020252,0.87340797838762,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991389512285571,0.00861048771442919,0.999998733244279,1.26675572142965e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16231,Simplex-lattice design and decision tree optimization of endophytic Trichoderma-multi-walled carbon nanotube composite for enhanced methylene blue removal,"This study investigates a novel approach for enhancing methylene blue (MB) removal from water using a composite of endophytic Trichoderma mate and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). For the first time, a unique combination of simplex-lattice design and decision tree learning algorithm was employed to optimize MB removal. This innovative approach effectively identified the optimal composite ratio of hyphal mate (0.5354 g/L) and MWCNTs (0.4646 g/L) for maximizing MB removal, which achieved remarkable removal efficiency ranging from 63.50 to 95.78 % depending on the combination used. The DT model further demonstrated promising potential for predicting MB removal efficiency. SEM revealed a unique hybrid material formed by the intertwining or entrapment of MWCNTs within the hyphal network of Trichoderma mate. FT-IR analysis confirmed the presence of novel functional groups on the MWCNTs' surface at 2438.79 and 528.25 cm−1, likely due to interactions with the endophytic fungi's biomolecules. These functional groups presumably act as reducing and stabilizing agents, promoting efficient MB adsorption. This research paves the way for utilizing the combined biological and chemical approach (fungal biomass and MWCNTs) in bioremediation applications. The findings suggest significant potential for practical applications in wastewater treatment, providing an eco-friendly and cost-effective method for dye removal. Furthermore, the proposed method shows promise for scaling up to industrial wastewater treatment and applicability in resource-limited settings, offering a sustainable solution for global water pollution challenges. Further investigations with larger datasets incorporating additional influencing factors are necessary to refine the predictive power of the DT model for practical applications. © 2024 The Author(s)",Abo-Neima S.E.; Elsehly E.M.; Al-Otibi F.O.; El-Metwally M.M.; Helmy Y.A.; Eldadamony N.M.; Saber W.I.A.; El-Morsi A.A.,Heliyon,2024,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e39949,0.978616448487831,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.960592284129953,0.0394077158700474,0.999999515500671,4.84499328767818e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

10752,Intra-specific differentiation of fungal endosymbiont Alternaria longissima CLB44 using RNA secondary structure analysis and their anti-infective potential,"New antimicrobial agents derived from endosymbiotic fungi with unique and targeted mode of action are crucially rudimentary to combat multidrug-resistant infections. Most of the fungi isolated as endosymbionts show close morphological feature resemblance to plant pathogenic or free-living forms, and it is difficult to differentiate these different lifestyles. A fungal endosymbiont strain CLB44 was isolated from Combretum latifolium Blume (Combretaceae). CLB44 was then identified as Alternaria longissima based on morphological and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) intervening 5.8S rRNA gene sequence analysis. ITS2 RNA secondary structure analysis was carried out using mfold server with temperature 37 degrees C, and anti-infective potential was determined by MIC and disk diffusion methods. ITS2 RNA secondary structure analysis clearly distinguished endosymbiotic A. longissima CLB44 from free-living and pathogenic A. longissima members in the same monophyletic clade. Secondary metabolites produced effectively inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25 mu g/ml), Escherichia coli (25 mu g/ml), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (50 mu g/ml), Candida albicans (100 mu g/ml), and other human pathogens. This study emerges as an innovative finding that explores newly revealed ITS2 RNAs that may be an insight as new markers for refining phylogenetic relations and to distinguish fungal endosymbionts with other free-living or pathogenic forms.

1521,"Root Herbivory: Grass Species,EpichloeEndophytes and Moisture Status Make a Difference","The root-feeding scarab insectCostelytra givenicauses severe damage to pasture ecosystems in New Zealand. Loline alkaloids produced by someEpichloeendophytes deter this insect. In two experiments, tall fescue infected withE. coenophiala, strain AR584, and endophyte-free (Nil) controls were subjected to pulse drought stress (DS) or well-watered conditions (WW). The second experiment also included meadow fescue infected withE. uncinata. After 4-6 weeks exposure to the different conditions, roots were excised and fed toC. givenilarvae for 7 days. Relative root consumption (RC), frass production, and relative weight change (RWC) of larvae were measured and the loline content of roots determined. RC and frass output were higher for larvae feeding on Nil DS tall fescue than WW and reduced by AR584. RWC was also greater on DS than on WW Nil plants but reduced by endophyte only in DS plants. RC, frass output, and RWC of larvae were reduced by endophyte in DS and WW meadow fescue, but the effect was greater for WW plants. Loline alkaloid concentration in roots was significantly higher in DS than WW tall fescue in Experiment I but higher in WW than DS meadow fescue in Experiment II. These experiments have demonstrated that moisture status interacts with endophyte to differentially affect root herbivory in tall fescue and meadow fescue.","Popay, AJ; Jensen, JG; Mace, WJ",MICROORGANISMS,2020,10.3390/microorganisms8070997,0.974233030766121,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99941654002797,5.8345997203023e-4,0.999999999993515,6.4852567760453894e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6984,Transcriptome analysis of Arabidopsis reveals freezing-tolerance related genes induced by root endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica,"Freezing stress is a serious environmental factor that obstructs plant development. The root endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica has proved to be effective to confer abiotic stress tolerance to host plants. To investigate how P. indica improves freezing tolerance, we compared the expression profiles of P. indica-colonized and uncolonized Arabidopsis seedlings either exposed to freezing stress or not. Nearly 24 million (93.5%) reads were aligned on the Arabidopsis genome. 634 genes were differentially expressed between colonized and uncolonized Arabidopsis exposed to freezing stress. Interestingly, 193 Arabidopsis genes did not respond to freezing stress but were up-regulated by P. indica under freezing stress. Freezing stress-responsive genes encoded various members of the WRKY, ERF, bHLH, HSF, MYB and NAC transcription factor families. The qRT-PCR analyses confirmed the high-throughput sequencing results for 28 genes. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that the fungus mainly controls genes for freezing-stress related proteins involved in lipid and ion transport, metabolism pathways and phytohormone signaling. Our findings identified novel target genes of P. indica in freezing-stress exposed plants and highlight the benefits of the endophyte for plants exposed to a less investigated environmental threat.","Jiang, W; Pan, R; Buitrago, S; Wu, C; Abdelaziz, ME; Oelmüller, R; Zhang, WY",PHYSIOLOGY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF PLANTS,2021,10.1007/s12298-020-00922-y,0.943629579802118,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.987080574865011,0.0129194251349893,0.998141322882006,0.0018586771179937,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Development of fungal mycelia inside and outside the host root and total fungal biomass were determined from assays of fungal chitin. Growth and P uptake by VAM plants and uncolonized controls were compared. Mycotrophic growth in VAM plants occurred during the final 6 wk of the 19-wk growth period, when the concentration of available soil P fell below 10 .mu.g P/g soil. Growth enhancement was most pronounced in the reproductive organs. The data suggest a relationship between the initiation of the reproductive phase in the host and the cessation of growth in the endophyte.

Globally, antibiotic resistance has made a significant impact, causing millions of fatalities each year. Endophytic fungi have gained considerable attention in research due to their potential to produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites, including natural substances with antimicrobial capabilities. The genera Aspergillus and Penicillium stand out as the most prevalent species of endophytic fungi. Filamentous fungi, such as these are responsible for the production of 45% of known microbial metabolites. This review focuses on exploring the bioactive substances produced by endophytic fungi from these two genera, particularly in conjunction with medicinal plants. Emphasis is placed on their antimicrobial activity and their ability to inhibit multidrug-resistant pathogens.

6726,Soil Fungal Community Composition and Diversity of Culturable Endophytic Fungi from Plant Roots in the Reclaimed Area of the Eastern Coast of China,"As an important resource for screening microbial strains capable of conferring stress tolerance in plants, the fungal community associated with the plants grown in stressful environments has received great attention. In this study, high-throughput sequencing was employed to study the rhizosphere fungal community in the reclaimed area (i.e., sites F, H, and T) of the eastern coast of China. Moreover, endophytic fungi from the root of six plant species colonizing the investigated sites were isolated and identified. The differences in soil physicochemical parameters, fungal diversity, and community structure were detected among the sampling sites and between the seasons. Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi (e.g., genera Tuber and Geopora) were dominant at site F, which was characterized by high soil total carbon (SC) and total nitrogen (SN) contents and low soil electrical conductivity (EC) value. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, including genera Glomus, Rhizophagus, and Entrophospora were dominant at sites H (winter), H (summer), and T (summer), respectively. The positive relationship between the EC value and the abundance of genus Glomus indicated the ability of this AM fungus to protect plants against the salt stress. Endophytic fungi at sites F (Aspergillus and Tetracladium), H (Nigrospora), and T (Nigrospora, Coniochaeta and Zopfiella) were recognized as the biomarkers or keystone taxa, among which only genus Aspergillus was isolated from the plant roots. The aforementioned AM fungi and endophytic fungi could contribute to the promotion of plant growth in the newly reclaimed land.","Zhong, F; Fan, XL; Ji, WH; Hai, ZX; Hu, NC; Li, XT; Liu, GY; Yu, CM; Chen, YH; Lian, BL; Wei, H; Zhang, J",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2022,10.3390/jof8020124,0.598213929258258,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.927440756241959,0.072559243758041,0.999556608438834,4.4339156116557e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

We identified eight putative chitin synthase (CHS) genes in F. verticillioides genomic sequence, and phylogenetic evidence shows that they group into seven established CHS gene classes. We targeted two CHSs (CHS5 and CHS7) for deletion analysis and found that both are required for normal hyphal growth and maximal disease of maize seedlings and ears. CHS5 and CHS7 encode a putative class V and class VII fungal chitin synthase, respectively; they are located adjacent to each other and are divergently transcribed. Fluorescent microscopy found that both CHS deficient strains produce balloon-shaped hyphae, while growth assays indicated that they were more sensitive to cell wall stressing compounds (e.g., the antifungal compound Nikkomycin Z) than wild type. Pathogenicity assays on maize seedlings and ears indicated that both strains were significantly reduced in their ability to cause disease. Our results demonstrate that both CHS5 and CHS7 are necessary for proper hyphal growth and pathogenicity of F. verticillioides on maize.","Larson, TM; Kendra, DF; Busman, M; Brown, DW",CURRENT GENETICS,2011,10.1007/s00294-011-0334-6,0.964877817735833,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996256119895425,0.00374388010457479,0.999990707491793,9.29250820669303e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12191,Assessment of antifungal activity of nano-chitosan against mung bean seed borne pathogen Aspergillus flavus through solid matrix priming,"Seed borne pathogens are one of the major causes of reducing crop yield worldwide. In the present investiga-tion, the most common seed borne pathogen of mung bean, Aspergillusflavus was isolated and identified, and the inhibitory effects of different concentrations of nano-chitosan against the fungal growth and spore ger-mination of Aspergillusflavus were evaluated for its effective management. The emergence and seedling vigor in post-primed inoculated mung bean seeds were also tested. Results clearly showed the antifungal activity of nano-chitosan against Aspergillusflavus. Nano-chitosan arrested the growth of fungal colonies and germi-nation of spores in a dose-dependent manner. Solid matrix priming with nano-chitosan improved the biotic stress tolerance of mung bean seeds against Aspergillusflavus infection and also improved the seedling vigor measured in terms of increased root length, shoot length, fresh weight, and dry weight along with various stress tolerance indices. It was observed that among all the treatments applied, Aspergillusflavus inoculated mung bean seeds primed with 571mg / ml nano-chitosan with 10% matrix (Celite) moisture level showed the optimum antifungal activity. These observations lead to the conclusion that nano-chitosan can be effectively used as ideal priming agent in preventing seed borne fungal infections and can also improve the seedling vigor.(c) 2022 SAAB.

12717,Foliar fungal endophyte communities are structured by environment but not host ecotype in Panicum virgatum (switchgrass),"Experimental tests of community assembly mechanisms for host-associated microbiomes in nature are lacking. Asymptomatic foliar fungal endophytes are a major component of the plant microbiome and are increasingly recognized for their impacts on plant performance, including pathogen defense, hormonal manipulation, and drought tolerance. However, it remains unclear whether fungal endophytes preferentially colonize certain host ecotypes or genotypes, reflecting some degree of biotic adaptation in the symbioses, or whether colonization is simply a function of spore type and abundance within the local environment. Whether host ecotype, local environment, or some combination of both controls the pattern of microbiome formation across hosts represents a new dimension to the age-old debate of nature versus nurture. Here, we used a reciprocal transplant design to explore the extent of host specificity and biotic adaptation in the plant microbiome, as evidenced by differential colonization of host genetic types by endophytes. Specifically, replicate plants from three locally-adapted ecotypes of the native grass Panicum virgatum (switchgrass) were transplanted at three geographically distinct field sites (one home and two away) in the Midwestern US. At the end of the growing season, plant leaves were harvested and the fungal microbiome characterized using culture-dependent sequencing techniques. Our results demonstrated that fungal endophyte community structure was determined by local environment (i.e., site), but not by host ecotype. Fungal richness and diversity also strongly differed by site, with lower fungal diversity at a riparian field site, whereas host ecotype had no effect. By contrast, there were significant differences in plant phenotypes across all ecotypes and sites, indicating ecotypic differentiation of host phenotype. Overall, our results indicate that environmental factors are the primary drivers of community structure in the switchgrass fungal microbiome.","Whitaker, BK; Reynolds, HL; Clay, K",ECOLOGY,2018,10.1002/ecy.2543,0.926355761438503,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.825065819774974,0.174934180225026,0.999762462537117,2.3753746288279e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

On the island of Moorea, French Polynesia, Cgm exhibits differential success along an elevation gradient, with highest effectiveness in controlling M. calvescens at higher elevations. We examined the association between the fungal biome of M. calvescens and Cgm biocontrol success using field surveys, microbiome sequencing, and in vitro competition experiments. Our results demonstrate that: (1) quantifiable differences in foliar damage occur across the elevation gradient despite the presence of Cgm at all elevations; (2) these differences correlate to differences in community structure of leaf-associated fungi in spite of close proximity of surveyed sites; and (3) endophytic fungi isolated from plant tissues exhibit different levels of competitive ability against Cgm in vitro, with higher competitive ability displayed by fungi isolated from lower elevations. Together, these results suggest an important role of the leaf microbiome in determining the success of biocontrol efforts made against invasive plants.","Garbelotto, M; Lowell, N; Chen, IY; Osmundson, TW",JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY,2019,10.1007/s42161-019-00247-0,0.915557846293812,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999115551988869,8.8444801113056e-4,0.999999305393485,6.94606514750618e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5398,Tremellomycetes Yeasts in Kernel Ecological Niche: Early Indicators of Enhanced Competitiveness of Endophytic and Mycoparasitic Symbionts against Wheat Pathobiota,"Tremellomycetes rDNA sequences previously detected in wheat kernels by MiSeq were not reliably assigned to a genus or clade. From comparisons of ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and subsequent phylogenetic analyses, the following three basidiomycetous yeasts were resolved and identified: Vishniacozyma victoriae, V. tephrensis, and an undescribed Vishniacozyma rDNA variant. The Vishniacozyma variant's clade is evolutionarily close to, but phylogenetically distinct from, the V. carnescens clade. These three yeasts were discovered in wheat kernel samples from the Canadian prairies. Variations in relative Vishniacozyma species abundances coincided with altered wheat kernel weight, as well as host resistance to chemibiotrophic Tilletia (Common bunt-CB) and necrotrophic Fusarium (Fusarium head blight-FHB) pathogens. Wheat kernel weight was influenced by the coexistence of Vishniacozyma with endophytic plant growth-promoting and mycoparasitic biocontrol fungi that were acquired by plants. Kernels were coated with beneficial Penicillium endophyte and Sphaerodes mycoparasite, each of which had different influences on the wild yeast population. Its integral role in the kernel microbiome renders Vishniacozyma a measurable indicator of the microbiome-plant interaction. The ability of NGS technology to detect specific endophytic DNA variants and early changes in dynamics among symbionts within the kernel ecological niche enables the prediction of crop disease emergence, suggesting that advanced microbiological testing may be a potentially useful tool for both phytoprotection and more efficient wheat breeding programs.","Vujanovic, V",PLANTS-BASEL,2021,10.3390/plants10050905,0.991467964737602,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999922036601714,7.7963398285705e-5,0.999999999239797,7.60202900629281e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Plants are capable of generating different bioactive secondary metabolites, but a large amount of botanical material is often necessary to obtain small amounts of the target substance. Nowadays, many medicinal plants are becoming rather scarce. For this reason, it is important to point out the interactions between endophytic microorganisms and the host plant, because endophytes are able to produce highly diverse compounds, including those from host plants that have important biological activities. Thence, this review aims at presenting the richness in bioactive compounds of the medicinal plants from Tabebuia and Handroanthus genera, as well as important aspects about endophyte-plant interactions, with emphasis on the production of bioactive compounds by endophytic fungi, which has been isolated from various medicinal plants for such a purpose.

1304,Foliar endophytes in trees varying greatly in age,"Temple trees, including the gymnosperm Platycladus orientalis and the angiosperm Styphnolobium japonicum, have been planted in China for thousands of years. Tree age thus varies widely from young to ancient trees. Foliar endophytes of P. orientalis and S. japonicum were surveyed in this exploratory study that was based on isolation into culture and sequencing of fungi from trees varying in age from 10 to 5000 years (P. orientalis) and from 10 to 1700 years (S. japonicum). Sequenced endophytes of P. orientalis and S. japonicum belonged to 24 and 16 fungal genera, respectively. Principal components analysis showed that 14 components were necessary to explain 90% of the variance in endophyte community structure in P. orientalis. In S. japonicum eight components were needed for 90%. It is against that backdrop of complex etiology in community structuring, that the relative frequencies (abundances) of 17 of the 24 endophytes from P. orientalis and 9 of the 16 from S. japonicum were significantly correlated with tree age. There were two major trends. Abundant fungal genera [Fusarium + Alternaria = 74.57% (P. orientalis) and 81.24% (S. japonicum)] tended to decline linearly with tree age. Most of the rare fungal genera, in contrast, increased in relative abundance linearly with tree age. Diversity (H ') and richness (Margalef) of endophyte communities in foliage thus increased as the trees aged. Relative abundances of pathogenic endophytes, or latent pathogens, (Pestalotiopsis funerea and Amyloporia subxantha in P. orientalis; Collectotrichum gloeosporioides and Botryosphaeria dothidea in S. japonicum) also increased linearly as the trees aged.Since leaf age does not vary with tree age in the deciduous S. japonicum, nor in the evergreen P. orientalis, 'tree age' currently lacks a mechanistic explanation for its apparent importance among common foliar endophytes.","Yu, ZD; Ding, HR; Shen, KC; Bu, FF; Newcombe, G; Liu, HX",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY,2021,10.1007/s10658-021-02250-7,0.880810069383492,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99409496448605,0.00590503551395023,0.999999984977971,1.50220287320479e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The total yield, natural decay rate, resistance to the pathogen and quality changes during storage were determined when the fruit reached maturity. The results showed that P. indica inoculation had no significant effect on the total yield of cherry tomatoes, but it could improve the fruit quality,including increasing the content of soluble protein and vitamin C in fruit by 0. 03 mg.g-1 and 3. 9 mg.100g-1, respectively. Meanwhile, it could delay the decrease of fruit firmness, vitamin C and soluble protein content during storage, as well as increase postharvest disease resistance of the fruits. The incidence of natural decay, black spot and gray mold decreased by 25. 0, 20. 0 and 17. 5 points compared with the control, respectively. The possible mechanism of disease resistance in the fruit induced by P. indica inoculation at seedling stage include improving the postharvest fruit quality, reducing the softening rate of the fruit, and then delaying the process of fruit maturation and senescence, and activating resistance-related enzymatic activity, peroxidase (POD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity mainly, during storage.

12075,Monitoring Coffee Leaf Rust (Hemileia vastatrix) on Commercial Coffee Farms in Hawaii: Early Insights from the First Year of Disease Incursion,"Coffee leaf rust (CLR, Hemileia vastatrix) is considered the most damaging coffee disease worldwide, causing reduced yields and even plant death. CLR was detected in Hawaii for the first time in 2020, and quickly spread across the state. We initiated a CLR monitoring program in Kona, West Hawaii Island, to track the spread of this new invasive disease across a broad elevational gradient. The goals of the program were to assist growers in the early detection of CLR, to characterize patterns of disease incidence across the region, and to collect information on farm agronomics, management practices, and costs to apply fungicides, all of which can be used to develop Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies for this pathogen. We monitored 30 coffee lots in Kona, located between 204 and 875 m elevation. Average CLR incidence remained below 4% early in the season and increased to 36% during harvest. We observed no significant difference in CLR incidence between low-, mid- and high-elevation farms. A significant reduction in the number of leaves per branch was observed at the end of the harvest season, and a significant negative correlation was found between the number of leaves per branch and maximum CLR severity. Mean disease incidence and mean severity were observed to have a significant positive correlation. Incidence increased above threshold levels (5%), despite most growers applying preventative fungicides 3-10 times throughout the season, suggesting that improved coverage and timing of applications is needed along with the addition of systemic fungicides.

21296,Antifungal activity of grape seed extract mediated titanium oxide nanoparticles against Candida albicans: An in vitro study,"Background: In today’s age, the incidence of local and systemic fungal diseases has increased due to a rise of new and fatal immunodeficiency diseases as well as immune-suppressive therapy due to which there is a heightened increase in the use of antifungal drugs which have significant side effects. Nanotechnology is rapidly growing in various fields of science. Aim: To determine the antifungal activity of grape seed-mediated titanium dioxide nanoparticles against Candida albicans. Materials and Methods: The collected grape seeds were powdered and stored in an airtight container. 1 g of grape seed extract was mixed with 100 ml of distilled water and was boiled for 15 minutes. The solution was filtered, to which 20 ml of distilled water was added. To this solution 0.862 g of titanium dioxide was added and was subjected to constant stirring until the formation of white suspension. This was centrifuged for 10 minutes and the antifungal property against Candida albicans was assessed. Results: The peak found at 650 nm in the UV spectroscopy indicates the formation of titanium dioxide nanoparticles. From the study it was found that with the increase in the concentration of the grape seed mediated titanium dioxide nanoparticles, the zone of inhibition against C. albicans was increased. The highest zone of inhibition obtained was 12 mm at 150 microliters. Conclusion: The antifungal activity of grape seed mediated titanium dioxide nanoparticles was studied and their wider zones of inhibition were suggestive of good antifungal activity. © 2020 Society for Biology and Biotechnology.

9598,Does endophyte symbiosis resist allelopathic effects of an invasive plant in degraded grassland?,"Allelopathic effects and plant associated systemic endophytic fungi are often thought to play a role in the invasion of exotic plant species. Here, we tested the inhibitory effects of the aqueous extracts of the hemiparasitic weed Pedicularis kansuensis on seed germination and seedling growth of endophyte-free (E-) and -infected (E+) grass species, Stipa purpurea and Elymus tangutorum. The weed extracts significantly inhibited both seed germination and seedling growth of the target grass species. Extracts from the inflorescences gave greater inhibition than those from the stems or roots, while the concentration of the extract had a direct effect on the extent of inhibition. The E+ target plants were less susceptible to the extracts than their E-counterparts. Our results suggest that the allelopathic potential of P. kansuensis will lead to increased frequencies of endophyte infected plants in grass populations.

4198,A mycorrhizal pathogen (Glomus macrocarpum Tul. & Tul.) of tobacco: effects of long- and short-term cropping on the mycorrhizal fungal community and stunt disease,"A crop rotation experiment was conducted on two adjacent tracts of land differing in long-term cropping history (30 year in tall fescue pasture or 3 year in sorghum-sudangrass hybrid (SSGH)). Short-term crops were 2 years in tobacco or low-endophyte (Acremonium coenophialum Morgan-Jones & Gams) tall fescue. Tobacco was grown on all plots in Year 3, and data relating mycorrhizal stunt disease of tobacco and populations of the stunt pathogen, Glomus macrocarpum Tul. & Tul., and of other members of the mycorrhizal, fungal community, were taken. Disease incidence was highest with SSGH-tobacco and lowest with fescue-fescue, the other two combinations being intermediate. Mycorrhizal colonization was related to disease occurrence. At the beginning of the season, populations of G. macrocarpum were equally high in land with a long-term history of SSGH, regardless of its short-term history; but at the end of the season, populations of G. macrocarpum among the four treatments were proportional to the incidence of disease. Populations of four mycorrhizal fungal species which were high in land with a short-term history of fescue were depressed by production of tobacco. Monocropping of tobacco appeared to narrow the diversity of the mycorrhizal fungal community and increased the proportion which is pathogenic, the overall result being lower productivity of soil for tobacco. Crop rotation of tobacco with fescue decreased the proportion of the mycorrhizal fungal community which is pathogenic and maintained productivity of soil for tobacco.","Guo, BZ; An, ZQ; Hendrix, JW",APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,1994,10.1016/0929-1393(94)90004-3,0.982878035320664,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997441352043226,0.00255864795677424,0.999978303425204,2.16965747964482e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

It appears to produce taxol and other taxanes in de novo fashion when grown in semi-synthetic liquid media. The presence of 1 in the fungal extract was confirmed by mass spectrometry, comparative chromatographic behavior with ''yew'' taxol, reactivity with taxol-specific monoclonal antibodies, and 9KB cytotoxicity studies. Both acetate-1-C-14 and phenylalanine UL-C-14 served as precursors of taxol-C-14 in fungal culture labeling studies, confirming the de novo synthesis of 1 by the fungus.

8827,Chemical investigation of novel ascomycetes using PCR based screening approaches,"Fungi are well known for a wealth of pharmacologically important activities and agrochemical properties. Polyketides that are widely found in fungi, are a large group of secondary metabolites which exhibit diversity in their function and structure. Here we described an investigation of three fungal strains which were prospected for production of polyketides. The aim of this work was to employ the diversity of reducing type I polyketide synthase genes in these fungi using a molecular and bioinformatics approaches as a mini tool. A degenerate primer pair for highly reduced PKSs was newly designed and used together with ketosynthase primers for amplification. One hundred and thirty-eight clones were sequenced. Ten KS domain sequences were isolated, using two primer pairs specific for highly reduced type PKSs. This study revealed four sequences from Emarcea castanopsidicola, four ketosynthase sequences from Gaeumannomyces amomi and two sequences from Leiosphaerella amomi, respectively. Bioinformatic techniques were employed to identify a group of these KS domain sequences. Based on these sequences suggested that rapid screening provided the potential to explore significant PKS structural diversity. Hence chemical investigation had been conducted and exhibited nine compounds. The endophytic fungus L. amomi was cultivated and elucidated linoleic acid, ergosterol and an unidentified sterol in the extracts. Linoleic acid, sitosterol, and p-hydroxybenzoic acid were isolated from the saprobic fungus E. castanopsidicola. We first isolated a new polyketide, stemphol 1-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside together with four known metabolites; stemphol, kojic acid, ergosterol, indole-3-carboxylic acid from an ethyl acetate extract of the cultures of G. amomi. Stemphol was classified as a phenolic lipid or resorcinolic lipid, which have biopharmacological, biomedical, and biotechnological importance. However, recent researches have revealed that these molecule types are synthesized by 2'-oxoalkylresorcinolic acid synthase. The prospective KS domain sequences from this study will be used as probes to isolate putative PKS genes. A gene cluster responsible for PK biosynthesis should be confirmed by determination of PK products generated by these enzymes.","Jumpathong, J; Peberdy, J; Fujii, I; Lumyong, S",WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY,2011,10.1007/s11274-011-0651-4,0.953375740329441,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994357073096483,0.00564292690351721,0.999999999425429,5.74571390465906e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

17087,Rice responds to endophytic colonization which is independent of the common symbiotic signaling pathway.,"As molecular interactions of plants with N2 -fixing endophytes are largely uncharacterized, we investigated whether the common signaling pathway (CSP) shared by root nodule symbioses (RNS) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses may have been recruited for the endophytic Azoarcus sp.-rice (Oryza sativa) interaction, and combined this investigation with global approaches to characterize rice root responses to endophytic colonization. Putative homologs of genes required for the CSP were analyzed for their putative role in endophytic colonization. Proteomic and suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) approaches were also applied, and a comparison of defense-related processes was carried out by setting up a pathosystem for flooded roots with Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strain PXO99 (Xoo). All tested genes were expressed in rice roots seedlings but not induced upon Azoarcus sp. inoculation, and the oscyclops and oscastor mutants were not impaired in endophytic colonization. Global approaches highlighted changes in rice metabolic activity and Ca(2+) -dependent signaling in roots colonized by endophytes, including some stress proteins. Marker genes for defense responses were induced to a lesser extent by the endophytes than by the pathogen, indicating a more compatible interaction. Our results thus suggest that rice roots respond to endophytic colonization by inducing metabolic shifts and signaling events, for which the CSP is not essential.",Chen X; Miché L; Sachs S; Wang Q; Buschart A; Yang H; Vera Cruz CM; Hurek T; Reinhold-Hurek B,The New phytologist,2015,10.1111/nph.13458,0.983269141989268,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997829316283432,0.00217068371656755,0.999998567206198,1.4327938019365e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
20037,Soaking grapevine cuttings in water: a potential source of cross contamination by micro-organisms,"Grapevine nurseries soak cuttings in water during propagation to compensate for dehydration and promote root initiation. However, trunk disease pathogens have been isolated from soaking water, indicating cross contamination. Cuttings of Vitis vinifera cv. Sunmuscat and V. berlandieri x V. rupestris rootstock cv. 140 Ruggeri were immersed in sterilized, deionised water for 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 h. The soaking water was cultured (25 C for 3 days) on non-specific and specific media for fungi and bacteria. The base of each cutting was debarked and trimmed and three 3 mm thick, contiguous, transverse slices of wood cultured at 25 C for 3 days. The soaking water for both cultivars became contaminated with microorganisms within the first hour. Numbers of fungi isolated from the wood slices soaked for one hour were significantly greater than those from non-soaked cuttings. The number of bacterial colonies growing from the wood slices increased after soaking for 2-4 h in Sunmuscat. In a second experiment Shiraz cuttings were soaked for 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h. The soaking water became contaminated within the first hour but only the bacterial count increased significantly over time. Microorganisms also established on the container surfaces within the first hour although there were no significant increases over 24 h. These results confirm that soaking cuttings is a potential cause of cross contamination and demonstrate contamination of cuttings occurs after relatively short periods of soaking. Avoiding exposing cuttings to water will reduce the transmission of trunk diseases in propagation.","Waite, H; Gramaje, D; Whitelaw-Weckert, M; Torley, P; Hardie, WJ",PHYTOPATHOLOGIA MEDITERRANEA,2013,NA,0.966501947767804,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.640807715002846,0.359192284997155,0.999816964862389,1.8303513761086e-4,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
19198,Epichloë Endophyte Enhanced Insect Resistance of Host Grass Leymus Chinensis by Affecting Volatile Organic Compound Emissions.,"In plant-herbivore interactions, plant volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play an important role in anti-herbivore defense. Grasses and Epichloë endophytes often form defensive mutualistic symbioses. Most Epichloë species produce alkaloids to protect hosts from herbivores, but there is no strong evidence that endophytes can affect the insect resistance of their hosts by altering VOC emissions. In this study, a native dominant grass, sheepgrass (Leymus chinensis), and its herbivore, oriental migratory locust (Locusta migratoria), were used as experimental materials. We studied the effect of endophyte-associated VOC emissions on the insect resistance of L. chinensis. The results showed that endophyte infection enhanced insect resistance of the host, and locusts preferred the odor of endophyte-free (EF) leaves to that of endophyte-infected (EI) leaves. We determined the VOC profile of L. chinensis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and found that endophyte infection decreased the pentadecane (an alkane) emission from uneaten plants, and increased the nonanal (an aldehyde) emission from eaten plants. The olfactory response experiment showed that locusts were attracted by high concentration of pentadecane, while repelled by high concentration of nonanal, indicating that Epichloë endophytes may increase locust resistance of L. chinensis by decreasing pentadecane while increasing nonanal emission. Our results suggest that endophytes can induce VOC-mediated defense in hosts in addition to producing alkaloids, contributing to a better understanding the endophyte-plant-herbivore interactions.",Deng Y; Yu X; Yin J; Chen L; Zhao N; Gao Y; Ren A,Journal of chemical ecology,2024,10.1007/s10886-023-01459-6,0.979046409496143,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991316812221463,0.00868318777853686,0.999999894686676,1.05313324061385e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16450,"Isolation, morphological characterization, and screening virulence of Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium robertsii fungal isolates  on Galleria mellonella","Background: Entomopathogenic fungi exists naturally in plants as an asymptote and have the potential to reduce the population of insect pests through indirect interactions. This study was conducted to detect and characterize the endophytic fungi Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium robertsii from the rhizosphere soil of tomato plants and their virulence effect on Galleria melonella. Methods: From the rhizosphere soil of 40 tomato fields, three Beauveria bassiana and seven Metarhizium robertsii isolates were isolated using the galleria bait method. All fungi isolate were morphologically characterized by their colony color, shape, and surface texture. Isolates with the highest percentages of germination, conidial yield, and radial growth were selected, and their virulence was evaluated on second instar larvae of Galleria melonella under laboratory conditions. Results: In this study, Beauveria bassiana showed white colony color and aseptate hyphae, whereas Metarhizium robertsii showed dark green to light green colony color and septate hyphal structures. Maximum spore production and conidial length were obtained by Beauveria bassiana isolate APPRC-27 with 2.67x10 7 spores ml -1 and 3.24 µm, respectively. Colony radial growth rates ranged from 1.73 to 3.24 mm day -1. The results revealed that the highest mortality rate of Galleria melonella (100%) was obtained by Metarhizium robertsii isolates K-61 and K-102 at a concentration of 1x10 8 conidial ml -1 at 7 days post-inoculation. The lowest mortality rate was registered by Metarhizium robertsii isolate RST-11. Conclusions: In the present study, isolates that produced the most spores and had the highest germination rates were the most virulent to Galleria mellonella second instar larvae. Therefore, virulent entomopathogenic fungi, Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium robertsii, are promising bioagents for the control of insect pests.

19617,Patterns in the Microbial Community of Salt-Tolerant Plants and the Functional Genes Associated with Salt Stress Alleviation.,"Salinity is an important abiotic stress affecting plant growth. We have known that plants can recruit beneficial microbes from the surrounding soil. However, the ecological functions of the core microbiome in salt-tolerant plants, together with their driving factors, remain largely unexplored. Here, we employed both amplicon and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to investigate the microbiome and function signatures of bulk soil and rhizocompartment samples from three salt-tolerant plants (legumes Glycine soja and Sesbania cannabina and nonlegume Sorghum bicolor). Strong filtration effects for microbes and functional genes were found in the rhizocompartments following a spatial gradient. The dominant bacteria belonged to Ensifer for legumes and Bacillus for S. bicolor. Although different salt-tolerant plants harbored distinct bacterial communities, they all enriched genes involved in cell motility, Na+ transport, and plant growth-promoting function (e.g., nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization) in rhizoplane soils, implying that the microbiome assembly of salt-tolerant plants might depend on the ecological functions of microbes rather than microbial taxa. Moreover, three metagenome-assembled genomes affiliated to Ensifer were obtained, and their genetic basis for salt stress alleviation were predicted. Soil pH, electrical conductivity, and total nitrogen were the most important driving factors for explaining the above microbial and functional gene selection. Correspondingly, the growth of an endophyte, Ensifer meliloti CL09, was enhanced by providing root exudates, suggesting that root exudates might be one of factors in the selection of rhizosphere and endosphere microbiota. Overall, this study reveals the ecological functions of the populations inhabiting the root of salt-tolerant plants. IMPORTANCE Salinity is an important but little-studied abiotic stressor affecting plant growth. Although several previous reports have examined salt-tolerant plant microbial communities, we still lack a comprehensive understanding about the functional characteristics and genomic information of this population. The results of this study revealed the root-enriched and -depleted bacterial groups, and found three salt-tolerant plants harbored different bacterial populations. The prediction of three metagenome-assembled genomes confirmed the critical role of root dominant species in helping plants tolerate salt stress. Further analysis indicated that plants enriched microbiome from soil according to their ecological functions but not microbial taxa. This highlights the importance of microbial function in enhancing plant adaptability to saline soil and implies that we should pay more attention to microbial function and not only to taxonomic information. Ultimately, these results provide insight for future agriculture using the various functions of microorganisms on the saline soil.",Zheng Y; Xu Z; Liu H; Liu Y; Zhou Y; Meng C; Ma S; Xie Z; Li Y; Zhang CS,Microbiology spectrum,2021,10.1128/Spectrum.00767-21,0.965538103240705,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.521410854041848,0.478589145958152,0.99999389679477,6.10320522986818e-6,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

14569,Antibacterial activities of penicillic acid isolated from Aspergillus persii against various plant pathogenic bacteria,"The emergence of pathogenic bacterial strains resistant to agrochemicals and the increasing demand for organic foods have led to the discovery of new antibacterial metabolites that can be used either directly or as a lead molecule for development of synthetic bactericides. During the screening of antibacterial fungal cultures, we found that one fungal strain, Aspergillus persii EML-HPB1-11, showed strong in vitro antibacterial activity against Xanthomonas arboricola pv. pruni (Xap) with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 10% of fermentation broth filtrate. The active compound was identified as penicillic acid (PA: 3-methoxy-5-methyl-4-oxo-2,5-hexadienoic acid) by mass and NMR spectroscopy. The in vitro antibacterial activity of PA was tested against 12 phytopathogenic bacteria. All of the bacterial pathogens tested were highly inhibited by PA with MIC values of 12·3-111·1 μg ml-1. It also effectively suppressed the development of bacterial spot disease in detached peach leaves, showing control values of 82·4 and 94·1% at concentrations of 111·1 and 333·3 μg ml-1 respectively. This is the first report on the production of PA by A. persii. This study suggests that PA can be used as a lead molecule for development of synthetic bactericides for control of various plant diseases.

10262,Strain identification and metabolites isolation of Aspergillus capensis CanS-34A from Brassica napus,"An isolate (CanS-34A) of Aspergillus from a healthy plant of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) was identified based on morphological characterization and multi-locus phylogeny using the sequences of internal transcribed spacer (ITS)-5.8S rDNA region, BenA (for -tubulin), CaM (for calmodulin) and RPB2 (for RNA polymerase II). The results showed that CanS-34A belongs to Aspergillus capensis Hirooka et al. The antifungal metabolites produced by CanS-34A in potato dextrose broth (PDB) were extracted with chloroform. Three antifungal metabolites were isolated and purified from the chloroform extract of the PDB cultural filtrates of CanS-34A, and chemically identified as methyl dichloroasterrate, penicillither and rosellichalasin. They all showed antifungal activity against the plant pathogenic fungi Botrytis cinerea, Monilinia fructicola, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Sclerotinia trifoliorum with the EC50 values ranging from 2.46 to 65.00g/mL. To our knowledge, this is the first report about production of penicillither by Aspergillus and about the antifungal activity of methyl dichloroasterrate, penicillither and rosellichalasin against the four plant pathogenic fungi.","Qin, J; Lyu, A; Zhang, QH; Yang, L; Zhang, J; Wu, MD; Li, GQ",MOLECULAR BIOLOGY REPORTS,2019,10.1007/s11033-019-04808-5,0.964089016628531,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997366656648752,0.00263334335124781,0.999998771593708,1.22840629235288e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
14710,Proteomic analysis reveals the mechanisms of Mycena dendrobii promoting transplantation survival and growth of tissue culture seedlings of Dendrobium officinale,"Aims: Dendrobium officinale is an important traditional Chinese medicinal herb. Its seedlings generally show low survival and growth when transferred from in vitro tissue culture to a greenhouse or field environment. In this study, the effect of Mycena dendrobii on the survival and growth of D. officinale tissue culture seedlings and the mechanisms involved was explored. Methods and Results: Mycena dendrobii were applied underneath the roots of D. officinale tissue culture seedlings. The seedling survival and growth were analysed. The root proteins induced by M. dendrobii were identified using two-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS (MALDI-TOF-MS). Mycena dendrobii treatment significantly enhanced survival and growth of D. officinale seedlings. Forty-one proteins induced by M. dendrobii were identified. Among them, 10 were involved in defence and stress response, two were involved in the formation of root or mycorrhizae, and three were related to the biosynthesis of bioactive constituents. Conclusions: These results suggest that enhancing stress tolerance and promoting new root formation induced by M. dendrobii may improve the survival and growth of D. officinale tissue culture seedlings.

8046,The local environment determines the assembly of root endophytic fungi at a continental scale,"Root endophytic fungi are found in a great variety of plants and ecosystems, but the ecological drivers of their biogeographic distribution are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the occurrence of root endophytes in the non-mycorrhizal plant genus Microthlaspi, and the effect of environmental factors and geographic distance in structuring their communities at a continental scale. We sampled 52 plant populations across the northern Mediterranean and central Europe and used a cultivation approach to study their endophytic communities. Cultivation of roots yielded 2601 isolates, which were grouped into 296 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by internal transcribed spacer sequencing of 1998 representative colonies. Climatic and spatial factors were the best descriptors of the structure of endophytic communities, outweighing soil characteristics, host genotype and geographical distance. OTU richness was negatively affected by precipitation, and the composition of communities followed latitudinal gradients of precipitation and temperature. Only six widespread OTUs belonging to the orders Pleosporales, Hypocreales and Helotiales represented about 50% of all isolates. Assessments of their individual distribution revealed particular ecological preferences or a cosmopolitan occurrence. Our findings support a strong influence of the local environment in determining root endophytic communities, and show a different niche occupancy by individual endophytes.","Glynou, K; Ali, T; Buch, AK; Kia, SH; Ploch, S; Xia, XJ; Çelik, A; Thines, M; Maciá-Vicente, JG",ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,2016,10.1111/1462-2920.13112,0.898074868553845,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999173860289461,8.2613971053943e-4,0.999998854480598,1.14551940200158e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12634,"Composition and diversity of microbial endophytes in roots, stems, and leaves of Angelica sinensis in three main planting areas","Angelica sinensis, a perennial medicinal herb, of which the dried roots are often used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat complex medical conditions. As medicinal plants and their endophytes are a symbiotic whole, a diverse range of endophytes play an important role in the growth and metabolism of the host medicinal plant. To explore the composition and diversity of endophytes in the tissues of A. sinensis growing in different geographical regions, the fungal and bacterial communities of the roots, stems and leaves of A. sinensis growing in three different production areas based on high throughput sequencing technology were characterized in this study. Results showed that in the Zhangxian area, the dominant endophytic fungal genera were Inocybe (74.00%), Septoria (73.27%) and Ceriporia (26.36%) and the dominant bacterial genera were Muribaculaceae (5.85%), taxa PB19 (6.38%) and Bacteroides (4.83%) in the tissues of A. sinensis. In the Minxian area, Inocybe (89.65%) and Alternaria (26.85%) were the prominent fungal genera and Muribaculaceae (8.23%) and taxa PB19 (5.58%) were the main bacterial genera. The predominant fungal genera in the Tanchang area were Thanatephorus (78.76%), Septoria (42.48%) and Inocybe (20.10%) and the predominant bacterial genera were taxa PB19 (6.18%), Muribaculaceae (5.43%) and Marivita (4.92%). Additionally, Inocybe was the most abundant fungal genus associated with the roots and stems of A. sinensis and Septoria was the most abundant fungal genus associated with the leaves of A. sinensis. Pseudomonas, Muribaculaceae, and taxa PB19 exhibited the highest abundance in the roots, stems and leaves of A. sinensis, respectively. The composition and abundance of endophytic microbial communities were tissue-, organ- and sampling area-dependent. Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Pearson correlation analysis of A. sinensis tissue samples revealed that different habitat and type of tissues and sampling areas influenced endophytic microbial community structures. Furthermore, principal co-ordinate analysis revealed that the endophytic bacterial compositions of the different tissue samples of A. sinensis from the three sampling areas were considerably different. By contrast, differences in fungal composition in the roots, stems and leaves of A. sinensis were only detected in the Tanchang area. The study contributes to understanding the community structure of endophytes associated with A. sinensis, and ascertaining the influence of geographic regions and ecological niches on the microbial communities, and also provides a theoretical basis for the rational development of the endophyte resources to improvement of the quality and enhancement of the comprehensive utilization value of A. sinensis.

6580,Antiplasmodial Properties and Cytotoxicity of Endophytic Fungi from Symphonia globulifera (Clusiaceae),"There is continuing need for new and improved drugs to tackle malaria, which remains a major public health problem, especially in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Natural products represent credible sources of new antiplasmodial agents for antimalarial drug development. Endophytes that widely colonize healthy tissues of plants have been shown to synthesize a great variety of secondary metabolites that might possess antiplasmodial benefits. The present study was carried out to evaluate the antiplasmodial potential of extracts from endophytic fungi isolated from Symphonia globulifera against a chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum (PfINDO). Sixty-one fungal isolates with infection frequency of 67.77% were obtained from the bark of S. globulifera. Twelve selected isolates were classified into six different genera including Fusarium, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Mucor, and Bipolaris. Extracts from the 12 isolates were tested against PfINDO, and nine showed good activity (IC50 < 10 mu g.mL(-1)) with three fungi including Paecilomyces lilacinus (IC50 = 0.44 mu g.mL(-1)), Penicillium janthinellum (IC50 = 0.2 mu g.mL(-1)), and Paecilomyces sp. (IC50 = 0.55 mu g.mL(-1)) showing the highest promise. These three isolates were found to be less cytotoxic against the HEK293T cell line with selectivity indices ranging from 24.52 to 70.56.

3866,THE ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION OF ENDOPHYTES,"The association between tall fescue and its endophyte is the best-known case of a symbiosis that is widespread in grasses, especially in cool-season, pooid grasses. Field and herbarium surveys have shown that many grasses are endophyte infected, often at 100% frequency. Ubiquitous endophyte infection with a host species is prima facie evidence that the association is mutualistic since ther are mechanisms by which individuals could lose the infection (e.g. extended seed dormancy). Studies have shown that the frequency of endophyte infection tends to increase over time, suggesting an ecological advantage for infected (E+) plants. A 3 year demographic experiment with tall fescue in a grassland community in Louisiana revealed that E+ plants had significantly higher survival, growth and flowering rates than E- plants. The mean fitness of E+ ball fescue was twice the mean fitness of E- plants. Greenhouse and common garden experiments have shown that E+ plants generally perform better than E- plants in mixtures. In order to separate the effects of endophyte-induced physiological changes in hosts versus protection against herbivory, a series of factorial competition experiments have been conducted where infection status, insect herbivory, density, and the identity of competing species were controlled. Preliminary results indicate that both infection and herbivory can affect competitive interactions among plants. The high frequency of seed-borne Acremonium endophytes within species of genera like Festuca, Lolium, Poa, and Stipa suggests that the association originated before speciation within these genera. The association of clavicipitaceous fungi with grasses spans a great range of interactions from localized ovarian parasites (e.g. Claviceps), systemic, choke-inducing fungi (e.g. Atkinsonella, Balansia, Epichloe), epiphytic fungi (Atkinsonella, some species of Balansia, Myriogenospora), and completely seed-borne, asymptomatic endophytes such as in Lolium. The question of what type of associations are ancestral and which are derived remains unanswered. The potential of these fungi for contagious spread and the presence or absence of a sexual reproductive system may influence genetic variation within taxa, and therefore their evolution and coevolution with grasses. Seed-borne Acremonium en-dophytes do not spread contagiously or reproduce sexually. They are reproductively isolated from other endophytes and can become genetically differentiated by the accumulation of random mutations. Isozyme electrophoresis has revealed abundant genetic variation in many Acremonium endophytes from wild grasses but, in contrast, artificial selection of cultivated grasses apparently has eliminated much genetic variation of endophytes. Future research on endophytes will focus on quantifying genetic variation for important traits such as alkaloid production, stroma formation, and host compatibility.","CLAY, K",AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,1993,10.1016/0167-8809(93)90038-Q,0.980866384552611,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999936410894519,6.35891054813047e-5,0.999999999987529,1.2470913191009499e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16874,DNA-based stable isotope probing enables the identification of active bacterial endophytes in potatoes.,"A (13)CO2 (99 atom-%, 350 ppm) incubation experiment was performed to identify active bacterial endophytes in two cultivars of Solanum tuberosum, cultivars Desirée and Merkur. We showed that after the assimilation and photosynthetic transformation of (13)CO2 into (13)C-labeled metabolites by the plant, the most directly active, cultivar specific heterotrophic endophytic bacteria that consume these labeled metabolite scan be identified by DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP).Density-resolved DNA fractions obtained from SIP were subjected to 16S rRNA gene-based community analysis using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and sequencing of generated gene libraries.Community profiling revealed community compositions that were dominated by plant chloroplast and mitochondrial 16S rRNA genes for the 'light' fractions of (13)CO2-incubated potato cultivars and of potato cultivars not incubated with (13)CO2. In the 'heavy' fractions of the (13)CO2-incubated endophyte DNA, a bacterial 492-bp terminal restriction fragment became abundant, which could be clearly identified as Acinetobacter and Acidovorax spp. in cultivars Merkur and Desirée,respectively, indicating cultivar-dependent distinctions in (13)C-label flow.

12785,Diversity and characteristics of colonization of root-associated fungi of Vaccinium uliginosum,"This study investigated ericoid mycorrhizal fungi (EMF) diversity in Vaccinium uliginosum across its main wild distribution range in China. Fungal communities in hair roots of V. uliginosum were analyzed using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Only 22 OTUs were assigned to putative EMF genera. Rhizoscyphus and Meliniomyces dominated EMF communities, followed by Clavaria, Oidiodendron, Lachnum, Acephala, and Phialocephala. There were more dark septate endophytes (DSE) reads from the Greater Khingan Mountains than from other study areas, similar to the results of the percent colonization of DSE by the magnified intersections method. Overall, high-throughput sequencing data provided a rough community-scale sketch of root-associated fungi of V. uliginosum. Two hundred and eighty slow-growing isolates were isolated from root pieces of V. uliginosum, and the isolates matched 16 fungal genera on the basis of morphological and internal transcribed spacer sequence comparison. The isolates of Cryptosporiopsis ericae, Oidiodendron maius, Lachnum sp., Sordariomycetes sp., and Pleosporales sp., formed ericoid hyphal coils via resynthesis trails. The co-existence between EMF and DSE in hair roots was observed via trypan blue staining. A putative model for the co-existence between EMF and DSE in the hair roots of V. uliginosum was proposed. We suggest that under certain environmental stresses, such as low temperature and poor available nutrients, ericoid plants may favor co-colonization by both DSE and EMF.","Yang, HY; Zhao, XY; Liu, CL; Bai, L; Zhao, M; Li, LL",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2018,10.1038/s41598-018-33634-1,0.969725684089236,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991802194156391,0.00819780584360943,0.999999982939553,1.70604472771174e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18535,[Advances and prospects of taxol biosynthesis by endophytic fungi].,"Taxol is one of the most important chemotherapeutic drugs against cancer. Taxol has been mainly extracted from the bark of yews for a long time. However, methods for the extraction of taxol from the bark of Taxus species were inefficient and environmentally costly. As a result of the high ecological toll exacted on trees with the potential for Pacific yew extinction, investigators began to look for other methods of taxol production. Recently, increasing efforts have been made to develop alternative means of taxol production, such as using complete chemical synthesis, semi-synthesis, Taxus spp. plant cell culture and microbe fermentation. Using microbe fermentation in the production of taxol would be a very prospective method for obtaining a large amount of taxol. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the molecular basis and genetic regulation mechanisms of taxol biosynthesis by endophytic fungi, which may be helpful to construct the genetic engineering strain with high taxol output. In this paper, the taxol biosynthesis pathway from Taxus cells and the advantages of taxol biosynthesis by endophytic fungi were discussed. The study on the isolation and biodiversity of taxol-producing endophytic fungi and the taxol biosynthesis related genes are also discussed. 紫杉醇是重要的抗癌药物之一，已经证明其对多种癌症具有显著疗效。目前，人们主要是从红豆杉的树皮中提取、分离和纯化紫杉醇，但由于红豆杉为生长缓慢、散生、濒危的珍稀植物， 且随着紫杉醇临床用途的不断拓宽，市场需求的稳定增长，单纯依靠从红豆杉树皮中提取紫杉醇已经无法满足日益增长的市场需求。为了解决紫杉醇的药源不足，科学家已把目光从红豆杉树分离提取紫杉醇转向了其他替代方法，如化学全合成、半合成、组织培养与细胞培养、微生物发酵法生产紫杉醇等。因此，了解内生真菌紫杉醇生物合成的分子基础和遗传调控机制，对解析内生真菌紫杉醇生物合成机制、构建高产紫杉醇基因工程菌株和早日实现内生真菌紫杉醇工业化生产具有重要的科学意义和现实意义。结合本课题组多年来的科研工作，概述了红豆杉细胞紫杉醇生物合成途径、内生真菌发酵生产紫杉醇的优势、产紫杉醇内生菌的分离研究现状和生物多样性及紫杉醇生物合成相关基因的研究现状。内生真菌生物发酵合成紫杉醇是可以无限生产、大量获取紫杉醇、解决紫杉醇药源短缺问题的很有前景的方法之一。.",Zhao K; Yu L; Jin Y; Ma X; Liu D; Wang X; Wang X,Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,2016,10.13345/j.cjb.150519,0.553874661622902,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.976540379085046,0.0234596209149541,0.999999973766417,2.62335827505566e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
12177,PLANT GROWTH PROMOTING ENDOPHYTIC YEAST GEOTRICHUM CANDIDUM (JX 477426) FROM ROOTS OF BRUGUIERA CYLINDRICA,"Dynamic mangrove ecosystems are fascinating sources of microorganisms which serve as an extraordinary habitat for the growth and development of many endophytic microorganisms. In this study, we isolated 16 endophytic fungi thriving in the mangrove species Bruguiera cylindrica, collected from Ayiramthengu in the state of Kerala, India. All the isolated endophytes were screened for their plant growth promoting activities (IAA, siderophore and HCN production, ACC deaminase activity) and enzyme production. Among the isolates, seven displayed only a single trait from the total plant growth promoting traits evaluated, although IAA production was a common trait observed amongst the lot. When IAA concentration was quantified in the culture medium, the isolate MEF 21 showed the highest IAA production (>45 mu g/mL). The ability of MEF 21 isolate to produce IAA, both in the presence and absence of L-Tryptophan was confirmed by TLC and GC-MS analysis. The isolate also produced siderophores and displayed ACC deaminase activity. The fungus exhibited high extracellular enzyme activity such as amylase, cellulase and protease. Vigna radiata seeds were treated with culture filtrates of MEF 21 to determine its plant growth promoting ability by vigor index method. A germination percentage of 93% and a vigor index of 337.59 were displayed by MEF 21 alone. In vitro antagonistic activity was also exhibited by MEF 21 against the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris with a growth inhibition zone of 35 +/- 1.5 mm diameter in the dual culture plate. This efficient plant growth promoting isolate, MEF 21, was further identified using morphological, biochemical and phylogenetic methods. Molecular identification included ITS-PCR utilizing universal primers. The PCR products were sequenced and submitted to GenBank. The isolate thus identified was Geotrichum candidum with an accession number JX 477426.

8941,Diversity and biological activity of fungal endophytes of Zingiber officinale Rosc. with emphasis on Aspergillus terreus as a biocontrol agent of its leaf spot,"Leaf spot of ginger caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is considered as a phytopathological constraint in the cultivation of ginger that has led to the economic loss of this valuable spice. Fungal endophytes serve as potent biocontrol agents for disease management because of their ability to colonize the same ecological niche similar to that of phytopathogen. The present study embarks on the isolation and identification of endophytic fungi from leaves and rhizomes of Zingiber officinale Rosc. A total of 563 endophytic fungal isolates were isolated which were grouped into 12 species belonging to 8 genera based on morphological characters and Internal Transcribed Spacers (ITS) sequence analysis. Among all the isolates, Aspergillus terreus possessed significant bioactivity profile and was subjected to bioassay guided fractionation. Various chromatographic and spectral analysis techniques led to the isolation and identification of an active molecule terrein. The purified compound displayed noteworthy antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities. Considering the antibacterial, cytotoxic and biocontrol potential of the fungus it could serve as a promising candidate in the field of agriculture and pharmaceutical industry.

20376,Lemongrass [Cymbopogon citratus (DC.) Stapf.] Oil: Potential Biocontrol Agent against Major Fungal Pathogens of Gumamela (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L.),"Lemongrass [Cymbopogon citratus (DC.) Stapf.] oil treatment at different volumes (10, 20, 30 and 50 mu L) was tested for its antifungal activity in vitro and in vivo against Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Fusarium moniliforme and Rhizoctonia solani, the fungal pathogens isolated from gumamela (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L.). The efficacy of the extracted lemongrass oil was compared with 30 mu L of 100 ppm Benomyl, a broad spectrum systemic fungicide. The in vitro assay showed that lemongrass oil significantly inhibited fungal growth at higher volumes when paper disk (at 50 mu L) or agar dilution (at 30-50 mu L) techniques were used. Based on in vivo assay, lemongrass oil significantly suppressed disease development in the inoculated Hibiscus plants, matching the performance of Benomyl. The bioactivity of the essential oil in its vapor phase could have made this fumigant effective in controlling the fungal pathogens. Foliar spray of lemongrass oil was found effective against C. gloeosporioides, a fungal pathogen causing foliar disease of Hibiscus.","Valencia, LDC; Castro, SD; Pascual, CB; Magdalita, PM",PHILIPPINE JOURNAL OF CROP SCIENCE,2011,NA,0.783265679546648,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Absence,0.263725238082992,0.736274761917008,0.999871966792435,1.2803320756538e-4,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
5828,Endophytic actinobacteria induce defense pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana,"Endophytic actinobacteria, isolated from healthy wheat tissue, which are capable of suppressing a number wheat fungal pathogens both in vitro and in planta, were investigated for the ability to activate key genes in the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) or the jasmonate/ethylene (JA/ET) pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana. Inoculation of A. thaliana (Col-0) with selected endophytic strains induced a low level of SAR and JANET gene expression, measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Upon pathogen challenge, endophyte-treated plants demonstrated a higher abundance of defense gene expression compared with the non-endophyte-treated controls. Resistance to the bacterial pathogen Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora required the JANET pathway. On the other hand, resistance to the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum involved primarily the SAR pathway. The endophytic actinobacteria appear to be able to ""prime"" both the SAR and JANET pathways, upregulating genes in either pathway depending on the infecting pathogen. Culture filtrates of the endophytic actinobacteria were investigated for the ability to also activate defense pathways. The culture filtrate of Micromonospora sp. strain EN43 grown in a minimal medium resulted in the induction of the SAR pathway; however, when grown in a complex medium, the JANET pathway was activated. Further analysis using Streptomyces sp. strain EN27 and defense-compromised mutants of A. thaliana indicated that resistance to E. carotovora subsp. carotovora occurred via an NPR1-independent pathway and required salicylic acid whereas the JANET signaling molecules were not essential. In contrast, resistance to F. oxysporum mediated by Streptomyces sp. strain EN27 occurred via an NPR1-dependent pathway but also required salicylic acid and was JANET independent.","Conn, VM; Walker, AR; Franco, CMM",MOLECULAR PLANT-MICROBE INTERACTIONS,2008,10.1094/MPMI-21-2-0208,0.990714332707024,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985908409278071,0.0140915907219289,0.999999970742588,2.92574124927114e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10782,Identity and Specificity of Rhizoctonia-Like Fungi from Different Populations of Liparis japonica (Orchidaceae) in Northeast China,"Mycorrhizal association is known to be important to orchid species, and a complete understanding of the fungi that form mycorrhizas is required for orchid ecology and conservation. Liparis japonica (Orchidaceae) is a widespread terrestrial photosynthetic orchid in Northeast China. Previously, we found the genetic diversity of this species has been reduced recent years due to habitat destruction and fragmentation, but little was known about the relationship between this orchid species and the mycorrhizal fungi. The Rhizoctonia-like fungi are the commonly accepted mycorrhizal fungi associated with orchids. In this study, the distribution, diversity and specificity of culturable Rhizoctonia-like fungi associated with L. japonica species were investigated from seven populations in Northeast China. Among the 201 endophytic fungal isolates obtained, 86 Rhizoctonia-like fungi were identified based on morphological characters and molecular methods, and the ITS sequences and phylogenetic analysis revealed that all these Rhizoctonia-like fungi fell in the same main clade and were closely related to those of Tulasnella calospora species group. These findings indicated the high mycorrhizal specificity existed in L. japonica species regardless of habitats at least in Northeast China. Our results also supported the wide distribution of this fungal partner, and implied that the decline of L. japonica in Northeast China did not result from high mycorrhizal specificity. Using culture-dependent technology, these mycorrhizal fungal isolates might be important sources for the further utilizing in orchids conservation.","Ding, R; Chen, XH; Zhang, LJ; Yu, XD; Qu, B; Duan, R; Xu, YF",PLOS ONE,2014,10.1371/journal.pone.0105573,0.995245282425113,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999703352402459,2.9664759754083e-4,0.99999999885012,1.1498800800424601e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
745,Expression of a novel chitinase by the fungal endophyte in Poa ampla,"Many wild and cultivated cool-season grass species are naturally infected with fungal endophytes of the genera Neotyphodium and Epichloe. These associations generally are considered mutualistic with the plants benefiting from reduced herbivory and the fungi benefiting from nutrients supplied by the plants. The fungi secrete proteins that might have a role in the interspecies symbiosis. In the interaction between Poa ampla Merr. and the endophyte Neotyphodium sp., a fungal chitinase was detected in the apoplastic protein fraction. The chitinase was also the major protein secreted in culture. Sequence analysis of the chitinase revealed it has a low level of amino acid sequence identity to other fungal chitinases and one of the conserved active site residues is altered. DNA gel-blot analysis indicated the chitinase was encoded by a single gene. Expression of similar chitinases also was detected in endophyte-infected tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and Chewings fescue (Festuca rubra L. subsp. fallax [Thuill] Nyman). This is the first report of an endophyte chitinase expressed in the infected host grass.

These fungal endophytes, in combination with the host organisms, synthesize many compounds with a range of pharmaceutical values. Most recently, the discovery of fungal endophyte genes which are linked with the biosynthesis of plant metabolites has opened a new field of research. These plant partners assist plants against biotic stress and protect them from pathogenic attacks or diseases with the presence of some important gene families like WRKY and MYB. The bioactive metabolites from this group are known for their anticancer, antimicrobial, antioxidant, antidiabetic, and anti-tubercular properties. Therefore, these bioactive compounds offer new routes for discovering novel drugs, which can boost the pharmaceutical industry in times of great demand for novel drugs. Extracellular enzymes are also produced within the members of this distinct group which are crucial for several industrial sectors, including the biofuel production industry. Furthermore, fungal endophytes are capable of synthesizing silver nanoparticles, which exhibit significant potential in fields like biomedical imaging and water purification.

12206,Efficacy of new generation oomycete-specific fungicides on life stages of Phytophthora meadii and field evaluation through bunch spraying system,"Fruit rot disease (FRD) of arecanut, caused by Phytophthora meadii, is an important fruit disease of this palm tree that resulted in huge economic losses to the growers in India. In recent years, the control of this disease has become a prime factor in the management of arecanut plantations. Though prophylactic sprayings of Bordeaux mixture (1%) along with other older fungicides are useful in reducing the disease severity. Hence, there is an urgent need for new generation molecules to combat FRD under field conditions. The present investigation was aimed at evaluating newer oomycete-specific fungicides in in-vitro on different life stages of Phytophthora and in -vivo through a Bunch Spraying System (BSS) from ground level. The pathogen was isolated, identified, and characterized from varied regions and one virulent isolate from each region was used. Out of the 11 fungicides tested, EC50 for mycelial inhibition among isolates was lowest in Famoxadone + Cymoxanil. Similarly, the lowest EC50 for sporangial production was recorded in Iprovalicarb + Propineb, Famoxadone + Cymoxanil, and Kre-soxymethyl ranging from 210.70 to 517.87 mg mL_1. The most effective fungicide for inhibition of zoospore release was Dimethomorph + Mancozeb which ranged from 406.81 to 565.80 mg mL_1. Bunch spraying of fungicides such as Bordeaux mixture (1%), mandipropamid (0.5%), fosetyl-Al (0.3%), and a combination of metalaxyl-mancozeb (0.2%) from ground level had a significant (P < 0.05) effect against FRD. These fungicides were found most effective in reducing the disease up to an extent of 65-70% and which in turn increased the dry nut yield by 75-95% when applied twice compared to untreated control. However, a semi-systemic fungicide mandipropamid could be a potential alternative to the Bordeaux mixture for effective control of FRD under field conditions.","Patil, B; Sridhara, S; Pruthviraj; Narayanaswamy, H; Hegde, V; Mishra, AK",CROP PROTECTION,2023,10.1016/j.cropro.2023.106232,0.971701673288846,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.980921064967781,0.0190789350322186,0.999999980870266,1.91297341300967e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
9969,FUNGAL COMMUNITIES IN WET TROPICAL FORESTS - VARIATION IN TIME AND SPACE,"Understanding variation in tropical forest fungal populations and communities is important for assessing fungal biodiversity, as well as for understanding the regulatory roles fungi play in tropical forests. In wet tropical forests, the canopy is typically occupied by certain wood decomposers, endophytes, epiphylls, and pathogens. Aphyllophoraceous canopy fungi are a subset of species found in the understory. Marasmioid agarics in the understory often form extensive networks of rhizomorphs that trap litter; these and other aerial species are rare on the forest floor. Decomposers are stratified within the forest floor, with some species colonizing only fresh litter, others preferring decomposed litter, and others restricted to soil organic matter. Specificity to particular host substrates is frequent among tropical forest litter decomposers and contributes to spatial heterogeneity in fungal communities over the landscape. Litter basidiomycete and microfungal communities in patches of 1 m(2) or less do not significantly resemble communities in similar patches located at distances greater than LOO m. Disturbances induce changes in the environment and the abundance of different substrates, resulting in changes in fungal communities through time, and variation over the landscape. Severe disturbances, as well as the slight daily variations in rainfall, profoundly affect populations of fungal decomposers and their influence on plant nutrient availability.","LODGE, DJ; CANTRELL, S",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE,1995,10.1139/b95-402,0.891280288355808,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.60587841506066,0.39412158493934,0.99994123077572294,5.87692242768334e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
3246,Neotyphodium endophyte infection frequency in annual grass populations:: relative importance of mutualism and transmission efficiency,"Persistence and ubiquity of vertically transmitted Neotyphodium endophytes in grass populations is puzzling because infected plants do not consistently exhibit increased fitness. Using an annual grass population model, we show that the problems for matching endophyte infection and mutualism are likely to arise from difficulties in detecting small mutualistic effects, variability in endophyte transmission efficiency and an apparent prevalence of non-equilibrium in the dynamics of infection. Although endophytes would ultimately persist only if the infection confers some fitness increase to the host plants, such an increase can be very small, as long as the transmission efficiency is sufficiently high. In addition, imperfect transmission limits effectively the equilibrium infection level if the infected plants exhibit small or large reproductive advantage. Under frequent natural conditions, the equilibrium infection level is very sensitive to small changes in transmission efficiency and host reproductive advantage, while convergence to such an equilibrium is slow. As a consequence, seed immigration and environmental fluctuation are likely to keep local infection levels away from equilibrium. Transient dynamics analysis suggests that, when driven by environmental fluctuation, infection frequency increases would often be larger than decreases. By contrast, when due to immigration, over-representation of infected individuals tends to vanish faster than equivalent over-representation of noninfected individuals.","Gundel, PE; Batista, WB; Texeira, M; Martínez-Ghersa, MA; Omacini, M; Ghersa, CM",PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES,2008,10.1098/rspb.2007.1494,0.543111650281652,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999096518971618,9.0348102838182e-4,0.999999999995421,4.57944793197385e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
16314,Multiple Chitin- or Avirulent Strain-Triggered Immunity Induces Microbiome Reassembly in Rice,"Magnaporthe oryzae is one of the most important fungal pathogens of rice. Chitin and avirulent strains can induce two layers of immunity response, pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI), in rice with cognate R genes. However, little is known about the assembly of the rice microbiome induced by PTI and ETI in rice. In this study, we investigate the impact of continuous treatment of the avirulent M. oryzae strain with AvrPi9 and chitin on the bacterial endophytic community of rice varieties harboring resistant gene Pi9 and their antagonistic activity against rice blast fungus. Analysis of the 16S rRNA showed a significant increase in the diversity and microbial co-occurrence network complexity and the number of beneficial taxa—Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Microbacterium, and Stenotrophomonas spp.—following the chitin and avirulent strain treatments. The antifungal assay with bacterial endophytes recovered from the leaves showed few bacteria with antagonistic potential in rice treated with avirulent strains, suggesting that the sequential treatment of the avirulent strain decreased the antagonistic bacteria against M. oryzae. Moreover, we identified Bacillus safensis Ch_66 and Bacillus altitudinis Nc_68 with overall antagonistic activities in vivo and in vitro.

3211,"Leaf, root, and soil microbiomes of an invasive plant, Ardisia crenata, differ between its native and exotic ranges","Introduction Ecological underpinnings of the invasion success of exotic plants may be found in their interactions with microbes, either through the enemy release hypothesis and the enhanced mutualism hypothesis. Whereas recent high-throughput sequencing techniques have significantly expanded our understanding of plant-associated microbiomes and their functional guilds, few studies to date have used these techniques to compare the microbiome associated with invasive plants between their native and exotic ranges.Methods We extracted fungal and bacterial DNA within leaf endosphere, root endosphere and soil of an invasive plant, Ardisia crenata, sampled from their native range Japan and exotic range Florida, USA. Using Illumina sequencing data, we compared microbial community compositions and diversity between the native and exotic ranges, and tested whether abundance of pathogenic or mutualistic microbes differ between the native or exotic ranges in accordance to the enemy release hypothesis or the enhanced mutualism hypothesis.Results Fungal and bacterial community compositions differed among leaves, roots and soil, and between the native and exotic ranges. Despite a higher microbial diversity in the soil in the exotic range than in the native range, the microbial diversity within leaf and root was lower in the exotic range compared to the native range. In addition, leaves in the native range harbored a greater number of plant pathogenic fungi compared to those in the exotic range.Discussion These patterns suggest plant controls over what microbes become associated with leaves and roots. The higher abundance of leaf pathogenic fungi, including the pathogen which is known to cause specific disease in A. crenata in the exotic range than in the native range, support the enemy release hypothesis and highlighted potential importance of examining microbial communities both above- and below-ground.","Nakamura, N; Toju, H; Kitajima, K",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2023,10.3389/fmicb.2023.1302167,0.989234528844242,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997741931147153,0.00225806885284729,0.99999999999957,4.29878355134861e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12144,Colonization of Piriformospora indica enhances rice resistance against the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens,"BACKGROUND: Piriformospora indica is an endophytic fungus that can promote the growth and confer resistance against diverse stresses in host plants by root colonization. However, the effects of P. indica colonization on improving plant resistance to insect pests are still less explored. The brown planthopper (BPH) Nilaparvata lugens is a serious monophagous pest that causes extensive damage to rice plants. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of P. indica colonization on rice resistance against BPH. RESULTS: The colonization of P. indica in rice roots resisted damage from BPH. Age-stage, two-sex life table analyses showed that feeding on P. indica-colonized rice plants affected BPH's female adult longevity, oviposition period, fecundity, population parameters and population size. BPH female adults feeding on P. indica-colonized plants excreted less honeydew. P. indica colonization remarkably increased the duration of np, N2, and N3 waveform, as well as the occurrences of N1 and N2, and decreased the duration of N4-b for BPH on rice plants. Meanwhile, the weight of BPH on the colonized plants was significantly lower than the control. In addition, the feeding and oviposition preferences of BPH to P. indica-colonized plants were reduced. qRT-RCR analyses revealed that P. indica colonization induced the expressions of jasmonic acid (JA)- and salicylic acid (SA)-related genes in rice plants. CONCLUSION: P. indica colonization can reduce BPH performance on rice plants with potential inhibitory effects on population growth. Collectively, these results support the potential for endophytically colonized P. indica as an effective strategy to improve insect resistance of crops.

Architecturally, compound 1 represents an unusual imine-containing IDT, while compounds 2 and 3 are rare 1(2),2(18)-di-seco-IDT derivatives. Their structures including absolute configuration were determined by spectroscopic analysis and computational method. Meanwhile, structure optimization of the primary penijbirine (15) was conducted to obtain 22 new IDT derivatives (21-42). Systematic evaluation of the antiadipogenic effects of 42 IDTs, including 13 isolated ones (1-13), seven previously reported ones (14-20), and 22 semi-synthetic derivatives (21-42), in 3T3-L1 adipocytes identified the structurally optimized derivative 38 as the most potent molecular for triglyceride-lowering activity, exhibiting an EC50 value of 0.25 +/- 0.05 mu M. Preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis highlighted critical pharmacophoric features governing the lipid-lowering efficacy of these compounds. Mechanism studies revealed that 38 suppressed adipogenesis and lipogenesis via activating the AMPK signaling pathway, evidenced by significantly increased phosphorylation of AMPK (p-AMPK). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays further confirmed that compound 38 directly bond to the AMPK protein with an affinity of KD = 12.4 mu M. This study not only expands the chemical diversity of bioactive IDTs but also identifies 38 as a novel AMPK-targeting lead compound for potential anti-obesity drug development.","Li, L; Zhu, XY; Zhu, JY; Cui, QY; Lin, YW; Lu, QR; Wu, SQ; Fu, YF; Zhou, QL; Yuan, T; Sun, ZH; Huang, D; Yuan, FY; Yin, S; Tang, GH",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY,2025,10.1016/j.ejmech.2025.117956,0.986990372991494,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999999559900095,4.40099904945427e-7,0.999999999997643,2.3566704143718198e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15055,Chemical Characterization of Trichoderma spp. Extracts with Antifungal Activity against Cocoa Pathogens,"Ecuador is one of the major cocoa producers worldwide, but its productivity has lately been affected by diseases. Endophytic biocontrol agents have been used to minimize pathogenic effects; however, compounds produced by endophytes are minimally understood. This work presents the chemical characterization of the Trichoderma species extracts that proved inhibition against cocoa pathogens. Solid–liquid extraction was performed as a partitioning method using medium with the fungal mycelia of Trichoderma reesei (C2A), Trichoderma sp.

The extract of T. spirale (C10) exhibited the growth inhibition (32.97–47.02%) of Moniliophthora perniciosa at 10 µg/mL, while a slight stimulation of Moniliophthora roreri was shown by the extracts of T. reesei (C2A) and T. harzianum (C4A) at higher concentrations. The inhibitory activity could be related to alkaloids, lactones, quinones, flavonoids, triterpenes, and sterols, as indicated by chemical screening and antifungal compounds, such as widdrol, β-caryophyllene, tyrosol, butyl isobutyrate, sorbic acid, palmitic acid, palmitelaidic acid, linoleic acid, and oleic acid, which were identified by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS).

This study was conducted to evaluate and describe the structural relationship of a bacterial community at the phyllosphere level with different plant species in a tropical ecosystem. Leaf blades of 47 plant species distributed in 27 botanical families were collected on a typical small Brazilian farm and prepared for observation under light and scanning electron microscopy. Naturally occurring bacteria were the most abundant settlers of the phylloplane, followed by fungal spore or hyphae. All plant species studied were colonized by phylloepiphytic bacteria, which were observed as solitary cells, microcolonies, and biofilms. However, independent of the family, the plant species differed in the pattern of phyllosphere colonization, as reflected in bacteria frequency and presence or absence of anatomical features that would favour the association. The phylloepiphytic bacteria were preferentially established on the following sites: epidermal cell wall junctions, glandular and nonglandular trichomes, veins, stomata, and epidermal cell wall surface. Profuse bacteria and fungi colonization was observed, at a level that was at least comparable with temperate regions. Interestingly, fungi seemed to alter the bacteria colonization pattern, most probably by microenvironmental modifications. The trichome type and density as well as the presence of epicuticular wax on the leaf blade surface seemed to be the most determinant anatomical features for the pattern of phyllosphere colonization. The presence of trichomes has a favourable, and epicuticular wax an unfavourable influence on the plant-bacteria interaction.","Baldotto, LEB; Olivares, FL",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY,2008,10.1139/W08-087,0.98978431505645,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999867299870068,1.3270012993192e-4,0.999999999974746,2.5253577007333696e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
8311,Antagonistic activity and chitinolytic potential of endophytic fungi recovered from cacti growing in the Brazilian tropical dry forest,"This study aimed to evaluate the antagonistic activity and chitinolytic potential of 20 species of fungal endophytes isolated from Cactaceae species and deposited at the URM culture collection in Brazil against nine strains of phytopathogenic fungi isolated from the forage cactus Nopalea cochenillifera. Phytopathogenic fungi were obtained from diseased tissues of N. cochenillifera and identified through analyses of morphology and DNA sequences of different genes (ITS rDNA, RPB2, and TEF1). The antagonistic potentials of these endophytes were analysed in terms of inhibition, parasitism and competition, and the enzyme activity by assay in submerged fermentation using colloidal chitin as a carbon source. Nine phytopathogenic fungi were isolated and identified as belonging to Alternaria, Curvularia, Fusarium, Neoscytalidium, and Neurospora. Antagonism by inhibition was the most significant category, with 17 endophytic species having inhibitory potential. Aspergillus tamarii URM 7505 and Penicillium griseofulvum URM 6846 inhibited all tested pathogenic fungi. Although all 20 endophytic fungal species effectively produced chitinase (0.20-5.36 U/ml), the highest production level was observed for Aspergillus parasiticus URM 6868 (5.36 U/ml).","Bomfim, AGJ; Santos, MGD; Bezerra, JDP; Paiva, LM; Oliveira, JTC; de Souza-Motta, CM; Moreira, KA",SYDOWIA,2021,10.12905/0380.sydowia73-2021-0197,0.973003277096748,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98359205957346,0.0164079404265398,0.999997147474387,2.85252561260663e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19658,Multiple strategies of plant colonization by beneficial endophytic Enterobacter sp. SA187.,"Although many endophytic plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria have been identified, relatively little is still known about the mechanisms by which they enter plants and promote plant growth. The beneficial endophyte Enterobacter sp. SA187 was shown to maintain the productivity of crops in extreme agricultural conditions. Here we present that roots of its natural host (Indigofera argentea), alfalfa, tomato, wheat, barley and Arabidopsis are all efficiently colonized by SA187. Detailed analysis of the colonization process in Arabidopsis showed that colonization already starts during seed germination, where seed-coat mucilage supports SA187 proliferation. The meristematic zone of growing roots attracts SA187, allowing epiphytic colonization in the elongation zone. Unlike primary roots, lateral roots are significantly less epiphytically colonized by SA187. Root endophytic colonization was found to occur by passive entry of SA187 at lateral-root bases. However, SA187 also actively penetrates the root epidermis by enzymatic disruption of plant cell wall material. In contrast to roots, endophytic colonization of shoots occurs via stomata, whereby SA187 can actively re-open stomata similarly to pathogenic bacteria. In summary, several entry strategies were identified that allow SA187 to establish itself as a beneficial endophyte in several plant species, supporting its use as a plant growth-promoting bacterium in agriculture systems.",Synek L; Rawat A; L'Haridon F; Weisskopf L; Saad MM; Hirt H,Environmental microbiology,2021,10.1111/1462-2920.15747,0.539414096837313,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.9451138782425,0.0548861217575,0.999999922546973,7.74530266589579e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
782,Tall fescue cultivar and fungal endophyte combinations influence plant growth and root exudate composition,"Tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.)] is a cool-season perennial grass used in pastures throughout the Southeastern United States. The grass can harbor a shoot-specific fungal endophyte (Epichloe coenophiala) thought to provide the plant with enhanced resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Because alkaloids produced by the common variety of the endophyte cause severe animal health issues, focus has been on replacing the common-toxic strain with novel varieties that do not produce the mammal-toxic alkaloids but maintain abiotic and biotic stress tolerance benefits. Little attention has been given to the influence of the plant-fungal symbiosis on rhizosphere processes. Therefore, our objective was to study the influence of this relationship on plant biomass production and root exudate composition in tall fescue cultivars PDF and 97TF1, which were either not infected with the endophyte (E-), infected with the common toxic endophyte (CIE+) strain or with one of two novel endophytes (AR542E(+), AR584E(+)). Plants were grown sterile for 3 weeks after which plant biomass, total organic carbon, total phenolic content and detailed chemical composition of root exudates were determined. Plant biomass production and exudate phenolic and organic carbon content were influenced by endophyte status, tall fescue cultivar, and their interaction. GC-TOF MS identified 132 compounds, including lipids, carbohydrates and carboxylic acids. Cluster analysis showed that the interaction between endophyte and cultivar resulted in unique exudate profiles. This is the first detailed study to assess how endophyte infection, notably with novel endophytes, and tall fescue cultivar interact to influence root exudate composition. Our results illustrate that tall fescue cultivar and endophyte status can influence plant growth and root exudate composition, which may help explain the observed influence of this symbiosis on rhizosphere biogeochemical processes.","Guo, J; McCulley, RL; McNear, DH",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2015,10.3389/fpls.2015.00183,0.968193822387252,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996693110380267,0.00330688961973298,0.999999996259173,3.74082742560233e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The alkaloid yields reached 770.36 693.76 and 693.76 mu g/gFW in the co-culture and elicitor-induced groups, which are 48 and 32% higher than the control group, respectively.","Tang, ZH; Rao, LQ; Peng, GP; Zhou, M; Shi, GR; Liang, YZ",JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL PLANTS RESEARCH,2011,NA,0.949882108032163,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.962654101407623,0.0373458985923766,0.999962775557093,3.72244429068802e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
9629,Native Rhizospheric and Endophytic Fungi as Sustainable Sources of Plant Growth Promoting Traits to Improve Wheat Growth under Low Nitrogen Input,"Wheat crops require effective nitrogen fertilization to produce high yields. Only half of chemical N-2 fertilizers are absorbed into plants while the rest remains in the soil, causing environmental problems. Fungi could maximize nitrogen absorption, and from an environmental and biodiversity point of view, there is an urgent necessity for bioprospecting native fungi associated with wild plants growing in harsh environments, e.g., St. Katherine Protectorate (SKP) in the arid Sinai. Recovered taxa, either endophytic and/or rhizospheric, were screened for their plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits. Eighteen fungal isolates (15 rhizospheric and 3 endophytic) belonging to anamorphic ascomycetes were recovered from 9 different wild plants, and their PGP traits (indole-3-acetic acid [IAA] production, phosphate solubilization, siderophore production, and hydrolytic enzyme production) were measured. Rhizospheric isolate NGB-WS14 (Chaetosphaeronema achilleae) produced high levels of IAA (119.1 mu g mL(-1)) in the presence of tryptophan, while NGB-WS 8 (Acrophialophora levis) produced high IAA levels (42.4 mu g mL(-1)) in the absence of tryptophan. The highest phosphate-solubilizing activity (181.9 mu g mL(-1)) was recorded by NGB-WFS2 (Penicillium chrysogenum). Endophytic isolate NGB-WFE16 (Fusarium petersiae) exhibited a high percentage level of Siderophore Unit (96.5% SU). All isolates showed variability in the secretion of extracellular hydrolytic enzymes. Remarkably, all isolates had antagonistic activity (55.6% to 87.3% suppression of pathogen growth) against the pathogenic taxon Alternaria alternata (SCUF00001378) in the dual-assay results. Out of the 18 isolates, 4 rhizospheric and 1 endophytic isolate showed significant increases in shoot dry weight and shoot nitrogen and chlorophyll content of wheat plants subjected to low inputs of chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizers (50% reduction) compared with the non-inoculated control in a pot experiment. Potent taxa were subjected to sequencing for molecular confirmation of phenotypic identification. The retrieved ITS sequences in this study have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers from LC642736 to LC642740. This study considered the first report of endophytic fungi of Cheilanthes vellea, a wild plant with PGPF which improves wheat growth.

14122,Endophytic and endolichenic fungal diversity in maritime Antarctica based on cultured material and their evolutionary position among Dikarya,"Fungal endophytes comprise one of the most ubiquitous groups of plant symbionts. They live asymptomatically within vascular plants, bryophytes and also in close association with algal photobionts inside lichen thalli. While endophytic diversity in land plants has been well studied, their diversity in lichens and bryophytes are poorly understood. Here, we compare the endolichenic and endophytic fungal communities isolated from lichens and bryophytes in the Barton Peninsula, King George Island, Antarctica. A total of 93 fungal isolates were collected from lichens and bryophytes. In order to determine their identities and evolutionary relationships, DNA sequences of the nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS), nuclear ribosomal small subunit (nuSSU), nuclear large subunit (nuLSU), and mitochondrial SSU (mtSSU) rDNA were obtained and protein coding markers of the two largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RPB1 and RPB2) were generated. Multilocus phylogenetic analyses revealed that most of the fungal isolates were distributed in the following six classes in the phylum Ascomycota: Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Lecanoromycetes, Leotiomycetes, Pezizomycetes and Sordariomycetes. For the first time we report the presence of subphylum Mortierellomycotina that may belong to an undescribed order in endophytic fungi. Taken together, our results imply that lichens and bryophytes provide similar niches and harbour a selection of these fungi, indicating generalists within the framework of evolutionary adaptation.  © 2018 Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute.",Yu N.H.; Park S.-Y.; Kim J.A.; Park C.-H.; Jeong M.-H.; Oh S.-O.; Hong S.G.; Talavera M.; Divakar P.K.; Hur J.-S.,Fungal Systematics and Evolution,2018,10.3114/fuse.2018.02.07,0.945732323881608,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.917967912653525,0.0820320873464754,0.99999998842395,1.15760503405227e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

11096,FUNGAL SYMBIONTS ALTER PLANT RESPONSES TO GLOBAL CHANGE,"While direct plant responses to global change have been well characterized, indirect plant responses to global change, via altered species interactions, have received less attention. Here, we examined how plants associated with four classes of fungal symbionts (class I leaf endophytes [EF], arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [AMF], ectomycorrhizal fungi [ECM], and dark septate endophytes [DSE]) responded to four global change factors (enriched CO2, drought, N deposition, and warming). We performed a meta-analysis of 434 studies spanning 174 publications to search for generalizable trends in responses of plant-fungal symbioses to future environments. Specifically, we addressed the following questions: (1) Can fungal symbionts ameliorate responses of plants to global change? (2) Do fungal symbiont groups differ in the degree to which they modify plant response to global change? (3) Do particular global change factors affect plant-fungal symbioses more than others? In all global change scenarios, except elevated CO2, fungal symbionts significantly altered plant responses to global change. In most cases, fungal symbionts increased plant biomass in response to global change. However, increased N deposition reduced the benefits of symbiosis. Of the global change factors we considered, drought and N deposition resulted in the strongest fungal mediation of plant responses. Our analysis highlighted gaps in current knowledge for responses of particular fungal groups and revealed the importance of considering not only the nonadditive effects of multiple global change factors, but also the interactive effects of multiple fungal symbioses. Our results show that considering plant-fungal symbioses is critical to predicting ecosystem response to global change.","Kivlin, SN; Emery, SM; Rudgers, JA",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,2013,10.3732/ajb.1200558,0.943248772092668,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999985856738968,1.41432610322933e-5,0.999999999770869,2.2913126951351602e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

With a large and growing database of complete fungal genomes, it may be possible to utilize portions of fungal symbiont genomes outside conventional marker sequences for community analysis of short-read data. We designed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify putative fungal coding sequences from 100 bp Illumina reads of DNA extracted from several angiosperm species (Castanea, Juglans, and Ulmus). Reads remaining after a two-step filtering process made up a small fraction of total reads (2-100 putative fungal reads per 10,000 plant reads) and were assigned to fungal genera and orders based on similarity to proteins from complete fungal genomes. Some of the taxa identified are known to be ubiquitous class 2 endophytes. We detected some differences in endophyte community composition based on ITS sequence data versus results from the short-read pipeline, particularly among Ulmus. ITS results in Juglans and Castanea, however, closely reflected results from the short-read pipeline, and both methods portrayed similar intergeneric differences in endophyte community composition.

Bacteria were isolated from soil samples collected when sunflower plants were at the end of the vegetative stage. A total of 29 endophytic strains were isolated from plants grown under irrigation or drought condition. Eight strains (termed SF1 through SF8) were selected based on nitrogen-fixing ability. All eight strains showed positive catalase and oxidase activities; five strains (SF2, SF3, SF4, SF5, SF7) solubilized phosphates; none of the strains produced siderophores. Strains SF2, SF3, SF4, and SF5, the ones with the highest phosphate solubilization ability, strongly inhibited growth of the pathogenic fungi Verticillum orense and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum but had less inhibitory effect on Alternaria sp.

Under natural condition the mycobiome was more diverse at lower than at higher elevation, whereas fungal diversity was lowest in the artificial habitat of the tree nursery. We further identified significant correlation of leaf chlorophylls and flavonoids with both habitat parameters and mycobiome biodiversity. The present results clearly point towards a pronounced importance of local stand conditions for the structure of beech leaf mycobiomes and for a close interrelation of phyllosphere fungi and leaf physiology.","Unterseher, M; Siddique, A; Brachmann, A; Persoh, D",PLOS ONE,2016,10.1371/journal.pone.0152878,0.968456054366213,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.920470094914605,0.0795299050853955,0.999978250202213,2.17497977865744e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
4299,Spectrum of Biological Activity of the Alternaria Fungi Isolated from the Phyllosphere of Herbaceous Plants,"Antimicrobial, phytotoxic, and insecticidal activity of 20 isolates of 16 Alternaria species isolated from above-ground organs of weeds and wild herbaceous plants was determined. Assessment of the antibacterial activity by the agar blocks and paper disks methods revealed antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis and/or Pseudomonassyringae in over 70% of the isolates. Antifungal activity against Candida tropicalis was found in 30% of the isolates. The reporter system used in the work revealed no effect of the studied extracts on the ribosomes, although some of them inhibited topoisomerase. Extracts from the culture liquid of all Alternaria spp. isolates were toxic to isolated leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana and Elytrigia repens. Insecticidal activity of the extracts against vetch aphid (Megoura viciae) larvae was revealed in 40% of the isolates. Thus, fungi from the phyllosphere of weeds and wild herbaceous plants may exhibit a broad range of biological activity. This feature may probably be of practical importance for toxicological assessment of those weed pathogens that are evaluated as potential bioherbicides. Our results show that Alternaria fungi may play a significant regulatory role in formation of the communities of phyllosphere organisms and are promising producers of antimicrobial compounds with potentially new mechanisms of action.","Berestetskiy, AO; Gannibal, FB; Minkovich, EV; Osterman, IA; Salimova, DR; Sergiev, PV; Sokornova, SV",MICROBIOLOGY,2018,10.1134/S0026261718060036,0.945008493614802,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.944692186174451,0.0553078138255491,0.999819538642159,1.8046135784077e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15982,Effect of trichoderma species on growth of pathogenic fungus hymenoscyphus fraxineus in dual cultures; [Utjecaj gljiva roda trichoderma na rast patogene gljive hymenoscyphus fraxineus u dvojnim kulturama],"Narrow-leaved ash, an important pioneer tree species in Croatian floodplain forests, is suffering severe dieback in the last years, mostly due to the pathogenic fungus Hymenoscyphus fraxineus. Multiple studies have shown that there is a possibility to control the pathogen with the use of endophytes, fungi that naturally occur in healthy plant tissue without causing any visible disease symptoms. As species of genus Trichoderma were found to be the most common endophytes of narrow-leaved ash root and stem in Croatia, in this research we tested the antagonistic activity of Trichoderma capillare, T. harzianum and T. tomentosum (each represented with one isolate) against H. fraxineus (represented with isolates HF16 and HF 120) in dual cultures. Control cultures with sterile agar plugs and self-inhibition cultures with two plugs of H. fraxineus mycelium were also established. All cultures were prepared in five repetitions, resulting in a total of 50 com-binations. Total growth, i.e. the colony radius of H. fraxineus was measured in three directions at four time points, first after 10 days of its independent growth, and then weekly after placing the challenge isolates in cultures. Both H. fraxineus isolates stopped growing in dual cultures with all three Trichoderma species in the period between the second and third measurement, i.e. 7-14 days after confrontation, while the ones in control and self-inhibition cultures continued growing. Fisher LSD test revealed that there was a significant impact of T. harzianum and T. tomentosum on growth reduction of both H. fraxineus isolates compared to pathogen’s growth in control cultures, while T. capillare significantly inhibited the growth of one isolate only (HF16). The same test showed that there was no significant difference in inhibition among used Trichoderma species, however, T. harzianum and T. tomentosum overgrew H. fraxineus completely (complete replace-ment) in the first 7 days of confrontation in all dual cultures, while T. capillare accomplished only partial replacement of the pathogen in 14 or 21 days of confrontation, depending on the culture. Also, the latter was the only species in this research inhibited reciprocally by the pathogen, i.e. there was a formation of the sterile zone without Trichoderma capillare growth (initial deadlock) visible in all dual cultures. Although our results support the possibility of using Trichoderma species in biological suppression of H. fraxineus, further extensive research is needed, with more frequent measurements encompassing more isolates of both the pathogen and these endophytes, and focusing on investigating exact mechanisms of inhibition and testing the efficiency in planta. © 2020, University of Zagreb, Faculty of Political Sciences.

11009,Combined inhibition of class 1-PI3K-alpha and delta isoforms causes senolysis by inducing p21<SUP>WAF1/CIP1</SUP> proteasomal degradation in senescent cells,"The targeted elimination of radio- or chemotherapy-induced senescent cells by so-called senolytic substances represents a promising approach to reduce tumor relapse as well as therapeutic side effects such as fibrosis. We screened an in-house library of 178 substances derived from marine sponges, endophytic fungi, and higher plants, and determined their senolytic activities towards DNA damage-induced senescent HCT116 colon carcinoma cells. The Pan-PI3K-inhibitor wortmannin and its clinical derivative, PX-866, were identified to act as senolytics. PX-866 potently induced apoptotic cell death in senescent HCT116, MCF-7 mammary carcinoma, and A549 lung carcinoma cells, independently of whether senescence was induced by ionizing radiation or by chemotherapeutics, but not in proliferating cells. Other Pan-PI3K inhibitors, such as the FDA-approved drug BAY80-6946 (Copanlisib, Aliqopa (R)), also efficiently and specifically eliminated senescent cells. Interestingly, only the simultaneous inhibition of both PI3K class I alpha (with BYL-719 (Alpelisib, Piqray (R))) and delta (with CAL-101 (Idelalisib, Zydelig (R))) isoforms was sufficient to induce senolysis, whereas single application of these inhibitors had no effect. On the molecular level, inhibition of PI3Ks resulted in an increased proteasomal degradation of the CDK inhibitor p21(WAF1/CIP1) in all tumor cell lines analyzed. This led to a timely induction of apoptosis in senescent tumor cells. Taken together, the senolytic properties of PI3K-inhibitors reveal a novel dimension of these promising compounds, which holds particular potential when employed alongside DNA damaging agents in combination tumor therapies.","Neuwahl, J; Neumann, CA; Fitz, AC; Biermann, AD; Magel, M; Friedrich, A; Sellin, L; Stork, B; Piekorz, RP; Proksch, P; Budach, W; Jaenicke, RU; Sohn, D",CELL DEATH & DISEASE,2024,10.1038/s41419-024-06755-x,0.97160535578372,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.930113016368215,0.0698869836317847,0.99999998625074,1.37492602858558e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2918,"THE IMPROVEMENT OF PLANT N ACQUISITION FROM AN AMMONIUM-TREATED, DROUGHT-STRESSED SOIL BY THE FUNGAL SYMBIONT IN ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAE","The ability of the external mycelium in arbuscular mycorrhiza for N uptake and transport was studied. The contribution of the fungal symbiont to N acquisition by plants was studied mainly under water-stressed conditions using N-15. Lettuce (Lactuca sativa L) was the host for two isolates of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Glomus mosseae and G. fasciculatum. The experimental pots had two soil compartments separated by a fine mesh screen (60 mum). The root system was restricted to one of these compartments, while the fungal mycelium was able to cross the screen and colonize the soil in the hyphal compartment. A trace amount of (NH4+)-N-15 was applied to the hyphal compartment 1 week before harvest. Under water-stressed conditions both endophytes increased the N-15 enrichment of plant tissues; this was negligible in nonmycorrhizal control plants. This indicates a direct effect of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on N acquisition in relatively dry soils. G. mosseae had more effect on N uptake and G. fasciculatum on P uptake under the water-limited conditions tested, but both fungi improved plant biomass production relative to nonmycorrhizal plants to a similar extent.","TOBAR, RM; AZCON, R; BAREA, JM",MYCORRHIZA,1994,10.1007/BF00203769,0.905644562847271,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999804500845853,1.954991541472e-4,0.999999996346225,3.65377483824147e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

While most isolates showed a preference for NH4+ as a sole nitrogen source, considerable variation was observed in the abilities of isolates to utilise amino acids and protein (BSA). In particular, large intraspecific variation was observed for glutamine and BSA utilisation, with some isolates thriving on these substrates while others produced little growth. The data suggest that individual isolates of H. ericae may vary considerably in their abilities to supply their host plants with nitrogen from different substrates in soil.

Original isolated and remunerated strain from colonized roots were identified as Bacillus spp. as per EzBiocloud database. The presence of bacteria in the root section of the plantlet was confirmed through Epifluorescence microscopy of colonized roots. The in-vitro plantlet colonized by PVL1 as well as DLMB attained higher growth than the control. PVL1 capable of producing plant beneficial phytohormone under in vitro cultivation.

7882,An antimicrobial compound from the endophytic fungus Phoma sp isolated from the medicinal plant Taraxacum mongolicum,"An endophytic fungus was isolated from the leaves of the Chinese medicinal plant Taraxacum mongolicum Hand.-Mazz. The phylogenetic and physiological characterization indicated that the isolate, strain PG23, was Phoma sp. Culture filtrate of PG23 displayed antagonism against some pathogenic bacteria owing to the existence of antibacterial compounds. The filtrate revealed in vitro strong antimicrobial activity on the studied bacteria, confirmed by the inhibition zone diameter (24 h after incubation) ranging from 24.2 to 40.0 mm depending on the microorganism being tested. The antibacterial extract was fractionated and purified on silica gel chromatography. From the culture extracts of PG23, a bioactive compound was isolated by bioactivity-guided fractionation and identified as 2-hydroxy-6-methylbenzoic acid based on spectral analysis obtained from nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, and mass spectrometry. The results show that 2-hydroxy-6-methylbenzoic acid has potential for poultry and aquatic product disease control. (C) 2012 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

14626,Ecology and epidemiology of the emerging plant pathogen Gnomoniopsis castaneae,"Gnomoniopsis castaneae is an emerging fungal pathogen causing nut rot on Castanea sativa, or living as an endophyte in the green tissues of the tree. The disease has been reported since the mid-2000s in European countries such as Italy, France and Switzerland. To date, the ecology and the epidemiology of G. castaneae have been mostly unexplored. The main goals of this work were: I) testing the association between the climate and the incidence of G. castaneae; II) assessing the influence of the plantation density on the spatial pattern of the nut rot infection through the development of a new geostatistical test; III) investigating some possible ecological interactions between G. castaneae and the exotic pest Dryocosmus kuriphilus (Asian chestnut gall wasp); and IV) comparing a large set of Castanea spp. cultivars and the wildtype of C. sativa to assess their levels of susceptibility to G. castaneae. A combined approach involving isolations, molecular analyses and the application of non-conventional statistical techniques was used. The methods were adapted depending on the specific aims of each experiment. In 2011, based on the inspection of 12 sites, the incidence of G. castaneae in north-western Italy was comprised between 20% and 93%. Climatic analyses showed that warmer temperatures were associated with higher levels of G. castaneae incidence, while no significant effect of the rainfall was detected. A series of models (GnoMods) was fitted, resulting in equations predicting the incidence of the disease at site level as a function of the temperatures of the months before harvesting. The GnoMods were significant (P < 0.05) and provided good predictive performances, as shown by the strong correlation between observed and predicted values resulting from the external validation (Spearman ρ > 0.72; P < 0.05). The comparison of areas with the same number of chestnut trees significantly clustered (P < 0.05) or randomized (P > 0.05) indicated that the spatial distribution of the trees carrying nuts infected by the pathogen was randomized (P > 0.05), regardless of the plantation density. The incidence of trees infected was not significantly different among areas (52.9%-71.4%; P > 0.05). The results suggest that the plantation density was not related to the spatial distribution of G. castaneae. To perform these analyses, new geostatistical tests (Mean Distance Tests-MDT) were developed, validated and embedded in a user-friendly software. MDT displayed reliable outcomes (power > 80%; type I error < 0.05) and can be applied to test the spatial pattern of any plant disease when the variable of phytopathological interest is categorical. DNA analyses showed that 40% of the adults of D. kuriphilus emerging from galls colonized by G. castaneae carried inoculum of the pathogen, yet the inoculum was not viable, since no fungal colonies could be isolated. Consequently, the pest is an unlikely vector of G. castaneae. On average, the emerging adults were significantly more abundant in galls colonized than in galls not colonized by the fungus (3.76 vs. 2.54, P < 0.05), indicating a possible fungus/pest synergy. The combined results of the Monte Carlo simulations, validated by isolation trials on chestnut buds inspected for D. kuriphilus eggs, showed that G. castaneae colonized 33.8% of the buds before oviposition, and that fungal colonization and oviposition were not associated (odds ratio 0.98, 0.71-1.33 95% CI). Consequently, the higher number of insects in galls colonized by G. castaneae might have been the effect of an interaction occurring after oviposition, probably during the insect development. The incidence of G. castaneae was compared between 85 chestnut cultivars and the wild-type of C. sativa growing in homogeneous environmental conditions. The statistical analyses showed that only cultivars significantly more susceptible (P < 0.05) than the wild-type (22% of the total number of cultivars in 2013 and 55% in 2014) could be identified. G. castaneae was isolated not only from C. sativa nuts, but also from nuts of Asian chestnut species and hybrids. The validation analysis revealed no significant association between the most susceptible cultivars detected in 2013 and 2014 (odds ratio 2.85; 0.18-176.61 95% CI). The results suggest that the levels of susceptibility of the chestnut cultivars and the wild-type were substantially homogeneous. In conclusion, the temperatures are strongly associated with the incidence of G. castaneae, while the plantation density of the orchards, the interaction with D. kuriphilus and the chestnut cultivars seem to play a negligible, or minor, role in the epidemiology of this plant pathogen. © 2016, Edizioni ETS.

8463,Identification of endophytic fungi from Livistona chinensis based on morphology and rDNA sequences,"A survey of the endophytic fungi in fronds of Livistona chinensis was carried out in Hong Kong. The endophyte assemblages identified using morphological characters consisted of 16 named species and 19 'morphospecies', the latter grouped based on cultural morphology and growth rates. Arrangement of taxa into morphospecies does not reflect species phylogeny, and therefore selected morphospecies were further identified based on ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequence analysis. The 5.8S gene and flanking internal transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) regions of rDNA from 19 representative morphospecies were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis based on 5.8S gene sequences showed that these morphospecies were filamentous Ascomycota, belonging in the Loculoascomycetes and Pyrenomycetes. Further identification was conducted by means of sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of both the ITS and 5.8S regions. Results showed that MS704 belonged to the genus Diaporthe and its anamorph Phomopsis of the Valsaceae. MS594 was inferred to be Mycosphaerella and its anamorph Cladosporium of the Mycosphaerellaceae.

18210,Conservation and transmission of seed bacterial endophytes across generations following crossbreeding and repeated inbreeding of rice at different geographic locations.,"There are comparatively diverse bacterial communities inside seeds, which are vertically transmitted and conserved, becoming sources of endophytes in the next generation of host plants. We studied how rice seed endophyte composition changed over time following crossbreeding, repeated inbreeding, subsequent human selection and planting of different rice seeds in different ecogeographical locations. Using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis to study bacterial communities, we observed that diversity between the original parents and their offspring may show significant differences in richness, evenness and diversity indices. Heat maps reveal substantial contributions of both or either parent in the shaping of the bacterial seed endophytes of the offspring. Most of the terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) of the subsequent progeny could be traced to any or both of its parents while unique T-RFs of the offspring suggest external sources of colonization particularly when the seeds were cultivated in different locations. Many similar groups of endophytic bacteria persist in the seeds even after recultivation in different locations, indicating resilience to environmental changes and conservation of bacteria across generations. This study suggests that parent plants contributed to the shaping of seed bacterial endophytes of their offspring, although it is also possible that these soil grown rice plants recruit similar populations of endophytes from the soil generation after generation. This study also highlights some bacterial groups belonging to Herbaspirillum, Microbacterium, Curtobacterium, Stenotrophomonas, Xanthomonas and Enterobacter that may be part of a transmitted and conserved ""core microbiota"" that are ubiquitous and dominant members of the endophytic communities of the rice seeds.",Walitang DI; Kim CG; Jeon S; Kang Y; Sa T,MicrobiologyOpen,2019,10.1002/mbo3.662,0.940522182928413,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.988283538864985,0.0117164611350148,0.999991288908387,8.71109161293404e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5319,Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin as an endophyte in tissue culture banana (Musa spp.),"Beauveria bassiana is considered a virulent pathogen against the banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus. However, current field application techniques for effective control against this pest remain a limitation and an alternative method for effective field application needs to be investigated. Three screenhouse experiments were conducted to determine the ability of B. bassiana to form an endophytic relationship with tissue culture banana (Musa spp.) plants and to evaluate the plants for possible harmful effects resulting from this relationship. Three Ugandan strains of B. bassiana (G41, S204 and WA) were applied by dipping the roots and rhizome in a conidial suspension, by injecting a conidial suspension into the plant rhizome and by growing the plants in sterile soil mixed with B. bassiana-colonized rice substrate. Four weeks after inoculation, plant growth parameters were determined and plant tissue colonization assessed through re-isolation of B. bassiana. All B. bassiana strains were able to colonize banana plant roots, rhizomes and pseudostem bases. Dipping plants in a conidial suspension achieved the highest colonization with no negative effect on plant growth or survival. Beauveria bassiana strain G41 was the best colonizer (up to 68%, 79% and 41% in roots, rhizome and pseudostem base, respectively) when plants were dipped. This study demonstrated that, depending on strain and inoculation method, R bassiana can form an endophytic relationship with tissue culture banana plants, causing no harmful effects and might provide an alternative method for biological control of C sordidus.

13025,Diversity of endophytic fungi from six dominant plant species in a Pb-Zn mine wasteland in China,"The fungi which cause asymptomatic infections in living plant tissues are called endophytic fungi. They comprise diverse groups of fungi and may protect their host plants against the insect pests and phytopathogens, as well as increase hosts fitness in extreme environments. In order to document the ecological relationship between endophytic fungi and their host plants which grown in heavy metal contaminanted soils, the endophytic fungal diversity, the dominant fungi and their host specificity of six dominant plant species (Arabis hirsuta, Acacia decurrens, Symplocos paniculata, Rabbosia eriocalyx, Arenaria serpyllifolia and Rosa longicuspis) collected from the Huize Pb-Zn mine wasteland of Yunnan Province, southwest China, were investigated. A total of 495 culturable endophytic fungi were isolated from 690 stems and leaf segments of the six plant species. The isolation rate of the endophytic fungi in the six plant species ranged from 0. 42 to 0. 93, and the mean isolation rate was 0. 72. The highest isolation rate appeared in R. eriocalyx, and the lowest isolation rate appeared in Ro. longicuspis. It was found that the isolation rate of the endophytic fungi in the stems was significantly higher than that in the leaves (P<0. 05, t test) in the six plant species. Based on their morphological characteristics, the way of spore production and spore characteristics, the sporulating isolates were identified to genus level. Non-sporulating isolates were identified as mycelia sterile and sorted into different groups based on the colony surface texture, hyphal pigmentation and growth rates after two months sporulation. The fungi were identified to 20 taxa, of which Phoma and Peyronellaea were the dominant endophytic fungi. The endophytic fungal richness of the six plant species was different. The highest endophytic fungal richness appeared in Ara. hirsuta, R. eriocalyx and Ro. longicuspis, from which 13 endophytic fungal taxa were obtained. While, the lowest richness appeared in Aca. decurrens and only nine taxa were found in it. Each plant species harboured one to two dominant fungi. The dominant fungi of Ara. hirsuta, Aca. decurrens and R. eriocalyx were Phoma and Peyronellaea, the relative frequency of them were 47. 22% and 27. 78%, 73. 33% and 16%, 48. 21% and 27. 68%, respectively. Alternaria was the dominant fungi of S. paniculata, the relative frequency was 46. 67%. The dominant fungi of Are. serpyllifolia were Alternaria and Peyronellaea, the relative frequency was 26. 74% and 25. 58%, respectively. The dominant fungi of Ro. longicuspis were Phoma and Alternaria, the relative frequency was 33. 34% and 15. 56%, respectively. The diversity index of endophytic fungi in the six plant species ranged from 1. 05 to 2. 29, which was similar to the diversity index of other non-polluted environments, suggesting that there are various heavy metal -resistant endophytic fungi in heavy metal contaminated areas. Besides, the diversity index of endophytic fungi from stems was 0. 98-2. 13, it was higher than that from leaves (0. 69-1. 79). Furthermore, we also found that the similarity index of the endophytic fungi in the six plant species ranged from 0. 455 to 0. 833, and the highest similarity index appeared in S. paniculata and Ro. longicuspis (0. 833), and the lowest similarity index appeared in Aca. decurrens and Ro. longicuspis, it was only 0. 455.

Based on eDNA samples and long reads as type materials, we describe 15 new species and corresponding genera (Pseudoentrophospora kesseensis, Hoforsa reParnigua craigii, Riederberga sylviae, Ruua coralieae, Tammsaarea vivikae and Unemaeea nathalieae), the genus Parvocarpum as well as 19 families (Pseudoentrophosporaceae, Hoforsaceae, Kahvenaceae, Kelottijaerviaceae, Kungsaengenaceae, Langduoaceae, Lehetuaceae, Lokrumaceae, Moosteaceae, Nikkaluoktaceae, Parniguaceae, Riederbergaceae, Ruuaceae, Tammsaareaceae, Unemaeeaceae, Bifigurataceae, Planticonsortiaceae, Jimgerdemanniaceae and Vinositunicaceae) and 17 orders (Hoforsales, Kahvenales, Kelottijaerviales, Kungsaengenales, Langduoales, Lehetuales, Lokrumales, Moosteales, Nikkaluoktales, Parniguales, Riederbergales, Ruuales, Tammsaareales, Unemaeeales, Bifiguratales and Densosporales), and propose six combinations (Diversispora bareae, ticola and Parvocarpum badium) based on phylogenetic evidence. We highlight further knowledge gaps in the phylogenetic structure of AM fungi and propose an alphanumeric coding system for preliminary communication and reference-based eDNA quality-filtering of the remaining undescribed genus- and family-level groups.

11801,Pathological effects of benomyl in male Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica),"The purpose of this experimental study was to observe the pathological and genotoxic effects of a systemic fungicide, Benomyl[methyl 1-(butyl carbamoyl)-2 benzimidazole carbamate] in male Japanese quails (Coturnix japonica). Benomyl (Benlate (R) DoPont 50% w/w benomyl) at dose rates of 0, 100, 400 and 1000 mg/kg for 8 consecutive days was administered into crops of quails kept in different groups. A significant decrease (p < 0.05) in feed intake, body weight and relative weight of testes was observed in benomyl-administered quails in a dose related manner. The size of testes decreased in benomyl treated quails. Microscopically, seminiferous tubules of testes exhibited a decreased number of spermatocytes, necrotic spermatids and syncytial cell formation. The number of quails developing testicular alterations increased in a dose-related pattern. These alterations reversed following a withdrawal of benomyl with the exception of the 1000 mg benomyl group, where these persisted till the end of the experiment (56(th) day). The mean tail length (mu m) of the comets produced by leukocytes in single cell gel electrophoresis of 0, 100 and 400 mg dose level groups were 3.48, 3.24 and 3.29, respectively. The mean tail length of comets of the 1000 mg dose level group was 12.03 mu m and significantly higher (p < 0.01) than in all other groups indicating DNA strand breaks at this dose level. These results suggested gonadotoxic effects of benomyl (Benlate (R)) and also a possible genotoxic effect at 1000 mg/kg level in Japanese quails.","Khan, MZ; Sajjad-Ul-Hassan; Mahmood, F; Khan, QM; Muhammad, G; Javed, I",ACTA VETERINARIA BRNO,2008,10.2754/avb200877020209,0.963061301681712,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.595346622458349,0.404653377541651,0.999976412776596,2.3587223403787e-5,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
13428,From Lamarckian fertilizers to fungal castles: Recapturing the pre-1985 literature on endophytic and saprotrophic fungi associated with ectomycorrhizal root systems,"The endophytic, mantle-inhabiting and rhizosphere-inhabiting microorganisms associated with ectomycorrhizal roots have been studied for over 100 years, but a surprising amount of the information obtained prior to the mid-1980's is difficult to access and understand. In large part, this is because research investigating local ecosystems and silvicultural practices was often considered regional in nature. It tended to be written up in many different languages and to be published in journals that were not widely distributed. After 1985, this scientific isolationism was broken up by the ubiquitous trend towards impact factor measurement and international publishing. The goal of the present review is to make still-relevant information from the pre-1985 ectomycorrhizosphere literature, especially its more strongly obscured elements, readily accessible to modern researchers. Also, some publications that fell into relative obscurity for historical reasons - in particular, studies seeming to reflect the brief association of Soviet mycorrhizal research of the early 1950's with the Lamarckian plant improvement ideas of T. D. Lysenko - are re-examined from current perspectives. The scattered data reveal considerable coherence despite the high ecological diversity they reflect. Endophytes such as members of the Mycelium radicis atrovirens complex - most prominently the species now known as Phialocephala fortinii - feature especially prominently in this area of study, and they received considerable attention beginning in the very early years of the 20th century. They were variously interpreted as potential symbionts or weak pathogens, an ambiguity that continues to the present day for many of these taxa despite the recent molecular clarification of species and population boundaries. The predominance of P. fortinii and other (normally) non-mycorrhizal ""dark (or hyaline) sterile endophyte"" fungi from stringently washed or surface-disinfected ectomycorrhizae in most ecosystems was shown repeatedly beginning with the studies of Elias Melin in the early 1920's. The adjacent rhizosphere soil typically contained sporulating fungi dominated by Penicillium, Umbelopsis and Mortierella species, sometimes accompanied by Trichoderma spp., Cylindrocarpon destructans, and various other microfungi. Microbiological investigations into whether ectomycorrhizae exerted a positive ""rhizosphere effect"" on numbers of fungal propagules in the surrounding soil showed that such effects were often less prominent in natural forests than in planted forests. Several studies showed a general reduction in microbial activity in the zone of ectomycorrhizal influence, and a particularly strong inhibition of soil organisms was shown in the symbiorhizosphere of Tricholoma matsutake and members of the genus Tuber. In relation to such cases, the adoption by mycologists of M. Ogawa's term ""shiro"", (castle, fortress) for the delimited, three-dimensional analogue of a fairy ring formed in soil by many ectomycorrhizal mycobionts is advocated. As relatively highly co-adapted communities, ectomycorrhizosphere organisms appeared to aid in root disease control, in part by harmlessly stimulating roots to produce defensive tannic materials. The production of these materials then appeared to favour the predominance of tannin-degrading Penicillium species in the rhizosphere. Rhizosphere inhabitants were shown to be involved in many types of nutrient and growth factor exchanges, but perhaps to be most important as solubilizers of refractory nutrients like inorganic phosphorus compounds and complex proteinaceous materials. Some potential pathogens like Fusarium spp. tended to be excluded from established forest soils, while Cylindrocarpon destructans, if present, tended to be confined to lower soil regions by microbial acidification of the upper soil zones. The complexity of microfungal communities and their known and potential interactions was high, and seemingly contradictory results often needed to be rationalized, e.g., Trichoderma spp. appeared to be favoured in the root zone in some ecosystems and partially excluded in others, and seemed to abet mycorrhiza formation and tree growth in some habitats but to cause damage to seedlings and mycorrhizal inoculum both in vitro and in the nursery. Modern techniques and bioinformatics methodologies will be needed to make progress towards understanding this complexity, but the multilingual and sometimes overlooked pre-1985 studies provide a very strong initial basis supporting further development.",Summerbell R.C.,Studies in Mycology,2005,10.3114/sim.53.1.191,0.931300053542547,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992645803911151,0.00735419608884876,0.990285090624714,0.00971490937528585,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1673,"THE RELATIONSHIP OF HOST AND ENDOPHYTE DURING FLOWERING, SEED FORMATION, AND GERMINATION OF LOLIUM-PERENNE","The development of a fungal endophyte in the tissue of Lolium perenne during flowering, seed set, and germination is described. The endophyte progresses intercellularly from the the vegatative apex into the inflorescence primordium and floral apices, from where it penetrates the tissues of ovary and ovule. At megagametophyte maturity, hyphae are concentrated outside its wall adjacent to the large lateral antipodal cells and subsequently gain entry to the embryo sac, probably soon after fertilisation. During early embryogenesis, hyphae occur on the surface of the embryo, and penetrate it at the ''notched'' stage. At seed maturity, hyphae are widespread within the embryo, including the plumule apex, as well as below the testa, between cells of the aleurone layer, and between scutellum and endosperm. At germination, hyphae outside the embryo appear to play no further part in invasion of the already infected embryo. The endophyte of Festuca arundinacea has a similar relationship with its host and appears to be ultrastructurally indistinguishable from that of Lolium perenne.","PHILIPSON, MN; CHRISTEY, MC",NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF BOTANY,1986,10.1080/0028825X.1986.10409724,0.983795857339944,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99786087242378,0.00213912757622006,0.999999999999956,4.40758540776187e-14,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18549,Transcriptome analysis of Pseudomonas mediterranea and P. corrugata plant pathogens during accumulation of medium-chain-length PHAs by glycerol bioconversion.,"Pseudomonas corrugata and P. mediterranea are soil inhabitant bacteria, generally living as endophytes on symptomless plants and bare soil, but also capable of causing plant diseases. They share a similar genome size and a high proteome similarity. P. corrugata produces many biomolecules which play an important role in bacterial cell survival and fitness. Both species produce different medium-chain-length PHAs (mcl-PHAs) from the bioconversion of glycerol to a transparent film in P. mediterranea and a sticky elastomer in P. corrugata. In this work, using RNA-seq we investigated the transcriptional profiles of both bacteria at the early stationary growth phase with glycerol as the carbon source. Quantitative analysis of P. mediterranea transcripts versus P. corrugata revealed that 1756 genes were differentially expressed. A total of 175 genes were significantly upregulated in P. mediterranea, while 217 were downregulated. The largest group of upregulated genes was related to transport systems and stress response, energy and central metabolism, and carbon metabolism. Expression levels of most genes coding for enzymes related to PHA biosynthesis and central metabolic pathways showed no differences or only slight variations in pyruvate metabolism. The most relevant result was the significantly increased expression in P. mediterranea of genes involved in alginate production, an important exopolysaccharide, which in other Pseudomonas spp. plays a key role as a virulence factor or in stress tolerance and shows many industrial applications.

8398,Occurrence and possible role of endophytic fungi associated with seed pods of Colophospermum mopane (Fabaceae) in Botswana,"Endophytic fungi were isolated from different aged surface sterilised pods of Colophospermum mopane and succession patterns were investigated. Lignocellulolytic enzyme assays as well as histological and fine structural studies were used to investigate if succession was related to different lignocellulolytic abilities of the fungi. Representatives of the common genera (Alternaria, Phoma and Phomopsis) were qualitatively tested for lignocellulolytic enzyme activity. Samples of endophyte infected and uninfected pod pericarps were fixed and sectioned for light microscopy and TEM. Samples were also viewed with SEM. A fungal succession was evident as pods aged, and detached from the tree. Strains of all three genera demonstrated lignocellulolytic abilities. Microscopy studies suggested that Phoma was only capable of utilising moderately lignified mesophyll cells whereas Phomopsis and Alternaria could degrade heavily lignified fibres. This could explain the pattern of succession observed: Phoma colonised younger pods where more unlignified resources were available, whereas Phomopsis and Alternaria colonised older pods, thus making use of the remaining lignified resources. Changes in endophyte abundance and diversity are related to the age and degree of decay of the pods, and determined by the lignocellulolytic abilities of the fungi. The potential role of these endophytes is discussed. (c) 2006 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we evaluated a suitable extraction method for gymnemic acid content from Gymnema inodorum and its ability to control C. gloeosporioides, the causal agent of mango anthracnose disease. In vitro study of G. inodorum extract and gymnemic acid against the most virulent and carbendazim-resistant C. gloeosporioides isolate was evaluated. The Soxhlet extraction method gave the highest gymnemic acid yield, followed by the aqueous extraction method. The study of the effect of crude extracts from G. inodorum, SP4, MT4, and CR4 at a concentration of 1000 ppm showed significant ability to inhibit C. gloeosporioides mycelia growth by 30.20%, 28.30%, and 26.43%, respectively. The results of the 5000 ppm crude extract effect on spore germination showed that the extract of MT4 and MT6 showed a significant decrease in fungal spores during the test period. Therefore, from the results of this study, G. inodorum extract obtained from the aqueous extract could be used in postharvest disease control of mango. It can also serve as an alternative material for farmers who intend to reduce their use of chemicals. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The National Academy of Sciences, India.",Suwan N.; Baison W.; Chuajedton A.,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences India Section B - Biological Sciences,2022,10.1007/s40011-022-01364-0,0.910598442775356,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.935078131886006,0.0649218681139938,0.999999995219252,4.78074801968376e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2970,Characterization of the Cassava Mycobiome in Symptomatic Leaf Tissues Displaying Cassava Superelongation Disease,"Superelongation disease (SED) is a fungal disease that affects cassava in the Caribbean. The symptoms include the appearance of dry necrotic spots and lesions on the leaves, which may severely affect the plant yield. However, the primary causal pathogen is difficult to culture and isolate in the lab because of its slow growth and potential contamination from faster-growing organisms. In addition, the leaf symptoms can be confused with those caused by other pathogens that produce similar necrotic spots and scab-like lesions. There is also little or no information on the contribution of endophytes, if any, to disease symptoms in cassava, a plant where the disease is prevalent. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the fungal communities in cassava associated with SED symptoms by analyzing gross fungal morphology and performing metagenomics profiling. First, several individual pathogenic fungi were isolated and cultured from diseased cassava leaf tissues from seven locations in Barbados (BB). Both culture isolation and molecular community analyses showed the presence of several other fungi in the disease microenvironment of symptomatic cassava leaves. These included Fusarium, Colletotrichum, and Alternaria species and the suspected species Elsino & euml; brasiliensis synonym Sphaceloma manihoticola. Additionally, a community analysis using ITS2 amplicon sequencing of 21 symptomatic leaf tissues from BB, St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG), Trinidad and Tobago (TT), and Jamaica (JA) revealed that the disease symptoms of superelongation may also result from the interactions of fungal communities in the mycobiome, including Elsino & euml; species and other fungi such as Colletotrichum, Cercospora, Alternaria, and Fusarium. Therefore, we suggest that examining the pathobiome concept in SED in the future is necessary.","Alleyne, A; Mason, S; Valles, Y",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2023,10.3390/jof9121130,0.923991757620881,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995331741306632,0.00466825869336809,0.999500456052282,4.9954394771811e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3148,Seasonal variations in location and population structure of endophytes in buds of Scots pine,"We studied the location and distribution of a bacterial isolate, a Mycobacterium sp., in buds of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.). Using a probe specific for the 16S rRNA of the Mycobacterium sp., the bacterium was found by in situ hybridization in the meristematic tissues of 40% of all bud samples examined. Because we had previously found other bacterial and fungal endophytes in the meristernatic tissues of Scots pine buds, we studied their occurrence in buds during shoot development and dormancy. Using probes targeted to the 16S or 18S rRNA of the endophytes Mycobacterium sp., Methylobacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp. and Rhodotorula minuta, endophytes were found in association with growing tissues, with Methylobacterium spp. being the dominant species. Endophytes were detected in abundance before elongation or differentiation of a bud, but once a tissue was fully developed, endophytes were no longer detected. Metabolic activity of the endophytes was suppressed at the onset of, and during, dormancy of Scots pine, but recovered before the following growing season.","Pirttilä, AM; Pospiech, H; Laukkanen, H; Myllylä, R; Hohtola, A",TREE PHYSIOLOGY,2005,10.1093/treephys/25.3.289,0.939945978905724,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.90312037320008,0.0968796267999196,0.999998557474836,1.44252516376397e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Several representatives of this class of compounds were active against powdery mildew on apple, cucumber, and barley, and against aphids and spider mites, both when applied to the leaves and when added to the nutrient solutions of test plants. Treatment of leaf halves resulted in protection of the entire leaves. A striking difference in pesticidal activity was observed between two series of isomers. Representatives of the series with the phosphoryl group in the 1-position showed much greater pesticidal activities than their corresponding isomers with the phosphoryl group in the 2-position. The optimum activity within the two homologous series (R-H, CH3 ... C6H13) was determined: generally the lower homologues (R-H, CH3, C2H5 and i-C3H7) showed the greatest pesticidal activity in the systemic tests.

1338,The Epichloe festucae Antifungal Protein Efe-AfpA Is also a Possible Effector Protein Required for the Interaction of the Fungus with Its Host Grass Festuca rubra subsp. rubra,"Strong creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra subsp. rubra) is a commercially important low-maintenance turfgrass and is often naturally infected with the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae. Epichloe spp. are endophytes of several cool-season grass species, often conferring insect resistance to the grass hosts due to the production of toxic alkaloids. In addition to insect resistance, a unique feature of the strong creeping red fescue/E. festucae symbiosis is the endophyte-mediated disease resistance to the fungal pathogen Clarireedia jacksonii, the causal agent of dollar spot disease. Such disease resistance is not a general feature of other grass/ Epichloe interactions. E. festucae isolates infecting red fescue have an antifungal protein gene Efe-afpA, whereas most other Epichloe spp. do not have a similar gene. The uniqueness of this gene suggests it may, therefore, be a component of the unique disease resistance seen in endophyte-infected red fescue. Here, we report the generation of CRISPR-Cas9 Efe-afpA gene knockouts with the goal of determining if absence of the protein in endophyte-infected Festuca rubra leads to disease susceptibility. However, it was not possible to infect plants with the knockout isolates, although infection was possible with the wild type E. festucae and with complemented isolates. This raises the interesting possibility that, in addition to having antifungal activity, the protein is required for the symbiotic interaction. The antifungal protein is a small secreted protein with high expression in planta relative to its expression in culture, all characteristics consistent with effector proteins. If Efe-AfpA is an effector protein it must be specific to certain interactions, since most Epichloe spp. do not have such a gene in their genomes.","Wang, RY; Luo, SM; Clarke, BB; Belanger, FC",MICROORGANISMS,2021,10.3390/microorganisms9010140,0.976469601809661,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.909909521889202,0.0900904781107983,0.999998226428039,1.77357196085026e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

1450,The relationship between chlorophyllous spores and mycorrhizal associations in ferns: evidence from an evolutionary approach,"PremiseApproximately 14% of all fern species have physiologically active chlorophyllous spores that are much more short-lived than the more common and dormant achlorophyllous spores. Most chlorophyllous-spored species (70%) are epiphytes and account for almost 37% of all epiphytic ferns. Chlorophyllous-spored ferns are also overrepresented among fern species in habitats with waterlogged soils, of which nearly 60% have chlorophyllous spores. Ferns in these disparate habitat types also have a low incidence of mycorrhizal associations. We therefore hypothesized that autotrophic chlorophyllous spores represent an adaptation of ferns to habitats with scarce mycorrhizal associations. MethodsWe evaluated the coevolution of chlorophyllous spores and mycorrhizal associations in ferns and their relation to habitat type using phylogenetic comparative methods. ResultsAlthough we did not find support for the coevolution of spore type and mycorrhizal associations, we did find that chlorophyllous spores and the absence of mycorrhizal associations have coevolved with epiphytic and waterlogged habitats. Transition rates to epiphytic and waterlogged habitats were significantly higher in species with chlorophyllous spores compared to achlorophyllous lineages. ConclusionsSpore type and mycorrhizal associations appear to play important roles in the radiation of ferns into different habitat types. Future work should focus on clarifying the functional significance of these associations.","Mellado-Mansilla, D; Testo, W; Sundue, MA; Zotz, G; Kreft, H; Coiro, M; Kessler, M",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,2022,10.1002/ajb2.16094,0.966568761752246,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.936925056843055,0.0630749431569454,0.999978875981497,2.11240185026274e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

20222,Impact of endophytic fungi on seed and seedling characteristics in tall and meadow fescues,"Tall fescue and meadow fescue are naturally infected with fungal endophytes, Neotyphodium coenophialum and Neotyphodium uncinatum, respectively. Seed traits are an important measure of the effects of the endophytic fungi which has been less addressed. In this study we used endophyte-infected (EI) and endophyte-free (EF) clones of tall and meadow fescue genotypes in the field to investigate the effects of endophytes on seed production traits and subsequently on seed germination and seedling emergence. Endophyte infection increased the plant seed weight, the number of seeds per plant and the number of panicles per plant in both plant species. Seed germination was not affected by endophytes in tall fescue, while it was improved in endophyte-infected plants of meadow fescue. A negative endophyte effect was detectable for seedling emergence percentage and emergence rate of tall fescue, whereas EI plants of meadow fescue were positively affected by the endophyte for these characteristics. The better performance of EI plants for seed production traits may increase their relative fitness in populations and cause them to be more stable in different environmental conditions.","Majidi, MM; Mirlohi, A",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT PRODUCTION,2016,NA,0.922220964782474,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.887274810772738,0.112725189227262,0.999997622137928,2.37786207246682e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

3997,Symptomless endophytic colonization of maize by Fusarium moniliforme,"Fusarium moniliforme Sheldon is a nonobligate parasite of maize that produces several mycotoxins. This fungus causes systemic infections of maize kernels, which then serve as dissemination vehicles and inoculum sources. Infected plants may or may not show disease symptoms. Symptomless infection was studied in maize plants and was compared with plants that eventually showed symptoms of seedling disease. Three isolates of F. moniliforme, a hygromycin-resistant mutant of two of these isolates, and Fusarium fujikuroi were used to infect surface and internally sterilized maize kernels, and symptomatic and symptomless infections were observed for 8 weeks. The results indicated that in symptomless infected plants, hyphae were intercellular only and distributed throughout the plant, whereas in plants showing disease symptoms, the fungus was both intercellular and intracellular. Symptomless plants remained symptomless throughout the observation period, and at the ultrastructural level there was no evidence of an antagonistic relationship. This indicates that the symptomless state persists beyond the seedling stage and could contribute, without visual signs, to the total mycotoxin contaminants of maize both before and during kernel development.","Bacon, CW; Hinton, DM",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE,1996,10.1139/b96-144,0.738530219615268,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998790001590424,0.0012099984095759,0.999995980625876,4.0193741235317e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

16795,First Report of Postharvest Fruit Rot in Persimmon Caused by Phacidiopycnis washingtonensis in Italy.,"Persimmon (Diospyros kaki L.) is widely grown in Italy, the leading producer in Europe. In the fall of 2009, a previously unknown rot was observed on 3% of fruit stored at temperatures between 5 and 15°C in Torino Province (northern Italy). The decayed area was elliptical, firm, and appeared light brown to dark olive-green. It was surrounded by a soft margin. The internal decayed area appeared rotten, brown, and surrounded by bleached tissue. On the decayed tissue, black pycnidia that were partially immersed and up to 0.5 mm in diameter were observed. Light gray conidia produced in the pycnidia were unicellular, ovoid or lacriform, and measured 3.9 to 6.7 × 2.3 to 3.5 (average 5.0 × 2.9) μm. Fragments (approximately 2 mm) were taken from the margin of the internal diseased tissues, cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and incubated at temperatures between 23 and 26°C under alternating light and darkness. Colonies of the fungus initially appeared ash colored and then turned to dark greenish gray. After 14 days of growth, pycnidia and conidia similar to those described on fruit were produced. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified using the primers ITS4/ITS6 and sequenced. BLAST analysis (1) of the 502-bp segment showed a 100% similarity with the sequence of Phacidiopycnis washingtonensis Xiao & J.D. Rogers (GenBank Accession No. AY608648). The nucleotide sequence has been assigned the GenBank Accession No. GU949537. Pathogenicity tests were performed by inoculating three persimmon fruits after surface disinfesting in 1% sodium hypochlorite and wounding. Mycelial disks (10 mm in diameter), obtained from PDA cultures of one strain were placed on wounds. Three control fruits were inoculated with plain PDA. Fruits were incubated at 10 ± 1°C. The first symptoms developed 6 days after the artificial inoculation. After 15 days, the rot was very evident and P. washingtonensis was consistently reisolated. Noninoculated fruit remained healthy. The pathogenicity test was performed twice. Since P. washingtonensis was first identified in the United States on decayed apples (2), 'Fuji', 'Gala', 'Golden Delicious', 'Granny Smith', 'Red Chief', and 'Stark Delicious', apple fruits also were artificially inoculated with a conidial suspension (1 × 106 CFU/ml) of the pathogen obtained from PDA cultures. For each cultivar, three surface-disinfested fruit were wounded and inoculated, while three others served as mock-inoculated (sterile water) controls. Fruits were stored at temperatures ranging from 10 to 15°C. First symptoms appeared after 7 days on all the inoculated apples. After 14 days, rot was evident on all fruit inoculated with the fungus, and P. washingtonensis was consistently reisolated. Controls remained symptomless. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of P. washingtonensis on persimmon in Italy, as well as worldwide. The occurrence of postharvest fruit rot on apple caused by P. washingtonensis was recently described in the United States (3). In Italy, the economic importance of the disease on persimmon fruit is currently limited, although the pathogen could represent a risk for apple. References: (1) S. F. Altschul et al.

17262,The effect of long-term Cd and Ni exposure on seed endophytes of Agrostis capillaris and their potential application in phytoremediation of metal-contaminated soils.,"We examined whether long-term Cd exposure leads to beneficial changes in the cultivable endophytic bacteria present in the seeds of Agrostis capillaris. Therefore the cultivable seed endophytes of Agrostis capillaris growing on a long-term Cd/Ni-contaminated plot (Cd/Ni seeds) were compared with those originating from a non-contaminated plot (control seeds). We observed plant- and contaminant-dependent effects on the population composition between control and Cd/Ni seeds. Also differences in phenotypic characteristics were found: endophytes from Cd/Ni seeds exhibited more ACC deaminase activity and production of siderophores and IAA, while endophytes from control seeds, very surprisingly, showed more metal tolerance. Finally, the 3 most promising seed endophytes were selected based on their metal tolerance and plant growth promoting potential, and inoculated in Agrostis capillaris seedlings. In case of non-exposed plants, inoculation resulted in a significantly improved plant growth; after inoculation of Cd-exposed plants an increased Cd uptake was achieved without affecting plant growth. This indicates that inoculation of Agrostis with its seed endophytes might be beneficial for its establishment during phytoextraction and phytostabilisation of Cd-contaminated soils.",Truyens S; Jambon I; Croes S; Janssen J; Weyens N; Mench M; Carleer R; Cuypers A; Vangronsveld J,International journal of phytoremediation,2014,10.1080/15226514.2013.837027,0.945680087904083,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.972918840670439,0.0270811593295608,0.999999042218986,9.57781014054859e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

16830,Assessing fungal root colonization for plant improvement.,"Fungal endophytes display a broad range of symbiotic interactions with their host plants. Current studies on their biology, diversity and benefits are unravelling their high relevance on plant adaptation to environmental stresses. Implementation of such properties may open new perspectives in agriculture and forestry. We aim to exploit the endophytic capacities of the fungal species Fusarium equiseti, a naturally occurring root endophyte which has shown antagonism to plant pathogens, and Pochonia chlamydosporia, a nematophagous fungus with putative endophytic behavior, for plant protection and adaptation to biotic and abiotic stress. A real-time PCR protocol for quantification of the fungal population, together with Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation with the GFP gene for confocal microscopy analyses, were designed and applied to assess endophytic development of both these fungal species. Although quantification of both F. equiseti and P. chlamydosporia yielded similar degrees of root colonization, microscopical observations demonstrated differences in infection and development patterns. Furthermore, we found evidences of plant response against endophyte colonization, supporting a balanced antagonism between the endophyte virulence and the plant defenses. Optimization and application of the methodologies presented herein will allow elucidation of beneficial interactions among these endophytes and their host plants.",Maciá-Vicente JG; Jansson HB; Lopez-Llorca LV,Plant signaling & behavior,2009,10.4161/psb.4.5.8393,0.968564719995487,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98937825205703,0.0106217479429698,0.999999736413288,2.63586712456743e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19352,Mechanisms of Microbial Plant Protection and Control of Plant Viruses.,"Plant viral diseases are major constraints causing significant yield losses worldwide in agricultural and horticultural crops. The commonly used methods cannot eliminate viral load in infected plants. Many unconventional methods are presently being employed to prevent viral infection; however, every time, these methods are not found promising. As a result, it is critical to identify the most promising and sustainable management strategies for economically important plant viral diseases. The genetic makeup of 90 percent of viral diseases constitutes a single-stranded RNA; the most promising way for management of any RNA viruses is through use ribonucleases. The scope of involving beneficial microbial organisms in the integrated management of viral diseases is of the utmost importance and is highly imperative. This review highlights the importance of prokaryotic plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria/endophytic bacteria, actinomycetes, and fungal organisms, as well as their possible mechanisms for suppressing viral infection in plants via cross-protection, ISR, and the accumulation of defensive enzymes, phenolic compounds, lipopeptides, protease, and RNase activity against plant virus infection.",Manjunatha L; Rajashekara H; Uppala LS; Ambika DS; Patil B; Shankarappa KS; Nath VS; Kavitha TR; Mishra AK,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2022,10.3390/plants11243449,0.907583051705302,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Absence,0.184666955802536,0.815333044197464,0.999223528823537,7.7647117646284e-4,Absence,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Presence,Absence
11885,Nature-inspired biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles for antibacterial applications,"In recent decades, nanotechnology has been empowered as a new and developing interdisciplinary region of science and innovation that coordinates material science and biology. Nanoscience and nano technology open up new streets of examination that are helpful in synthesizing novel nanomaterials with remarkable applications. Among different metal nanomaterials, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) attracted the attention of researchers due to their versatile antibacterial characteristics and biological properties. Biogenically synthesizing AgNPs from plants and microorganisms seems to be a highly promising alternative for developing a technology that is both environmentally benign and fast. Plants and microorganisms' ability to synthesize AgNPs has mostly remained untapped, and the lack of investigation is due to the vast variety of plants and microorganisms. This review aims to describe the current progress in various synthetic techniques for AgNPs and their potential for antibacterial applications. It discusses biogenic synthetic approaches, the role of various metabolites in the growth processes of AgNPs with antibacterial implications, bactericidal mechanisms, and the influence of operational parameters on AgNPs synthesis. Furthermore, the present status, critical challenges, and future outlook of AgNPs will be explored, which will definitely affect their present and future scenarios. We believe that by focusing readers' attention on nature-inspired, biogenically synthesized AgNPs and their bactericidal applications, this review will enable them to formulate a new perspective.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

1805,"Distribution, colonization and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi associated with central Himalayan rhododendrons","The objective of the present study was to investigate arbuscular mycorrhizal status of five species of rhododendrons distributed in Kumaun region of the Indian Central Himalaya. Root and rhizosphere soil samples of all the five species of rhododendrons, namely, Rhododendron anthopogon, R. arboreum, R. campanulatum, R. barbatum and R. lepidotum were collected from temperate, sub-alpine to alpine location in altitudinal range from 1500 to 4500 m amsl. The arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization in root samples ranged from 28 to 42%; and maximum and minimum colonization was observed in R. arboreum and R. lepidotum, respectively. The highest number of intraradical vesicles (12.5 +/- 2.8 cm(-1) root segment) was recorded in R. arboreum and the lowest (7.0 +/- 1.7 cm(-1) root segment) in R. barbatum; vesicles were not observed in R. lepidotum. Spores were extracted from the rhizosphere soil by wet sieving to perform microscopic identification of the species. The maximum and minimum populations of spores were detected in the rhizosphere soil samples of R. anthopogon (52.0 +/- 1.5 spores 25 g(-1) soil) and R. lepidotum (32.0 +/- 2.5 spore 25 g(-1) soil), respectively. Spore populations were found to belong to five genera-Acaulospora, Glomus, Gigaspora, Sclerocystis and Scutellispora; genus Glomus was found to be dominant in the rhizosphere soil samples of all the rhododendron species. The most frequent and abundant species was G. fasciculatum, however, this species was not isolated from the rhizosphere soil of R. barbatum. Finger millet (Eleucine coracana) was used to cultivate the trap culture of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to confirm the species identity. Spores of Glomus pustulatum, not detected in the rhizosphere soil, were recovered from the trap culture. Contrary to this, genus Gigaspora, which was present in the rhizosphere soil, did not sporulate in the trap culture. Shannon and Wiener index of diversity and Simpson's index of dominance indicated that the species richness, dominance and diversity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi decrease with increasing altitude. In two species of rhododendrons, namely R. campanulatum and R. anthopogon, dark septate mycelium, was also observed. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

15939,"Evaluation of antimicrobial, antioxidant and cytotoxic properties of bioactive compounds produced from endophytic fungi of Himalayan yew (Taxus wallichiana) in Nepal","Background: Endophytic fungi are largely underexplored in the discovery of natural bioactive products though being rich sources of novel compounds with promising pharmaceutical potential. In this study, Taxus wallichiana, which has huge medicinal value, was investigated for its endophytic diversity and capability to produce bioactive secondary metabolites by analyzing antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties. Methods: The endophytes were identified by ITS-PCR using genomic DNA samples. The secondary metabolites were extracted by solvent extraction method using ethyl acetate. The antioxidant activity was analyzed by Thin Layer Chromatography, Total Phenol Content (TPC), Total Flavonoid Content (TFC) and DPPH assay, and the antimicrobial activity was analyzed by agar-well diffusion method. Brine shrimp lethality assay was used to analyze the cytotoxicity of the fungal extracts. Results: Out of 16 different Taxus trees sampled from different locations of Dhorpatan, 13 distinctive endophytic fungi were isolated and grouped into 9 different genera: Bjerkandera, Trichoderma, Preussia, Botrytis, Arthrinium, Alternaria, Cladosporium, Sporormiella and Daldinia. The ethyl acetate extracts isolated from three endophytic fungi: Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium cladosporioides and Alternaria brassicae showed significant TPC values of 204PlusMinus;6.144, 312.3PlusMinus;2.147 and 152.7PlusMinus;4.958g GAE/mg of dry extract, respectively, and TFC values of 177.9PlusMinus;2.911, 644.1PlusMinus;4.202 and 96.38PlusMinus;3.851g RE/mg of dry extract, respectively. Furthermore, these three extracts showed a dose dependent radical scavenging activity with IC 50 concentration of 22.85, 22.15 and 23.001 g/ml, respectively. The extracts of C. cladosporioides and A. brassicae also showed promising antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 250g/ml for all bacteria. Both the samples showed cytotoxic property against shrimp nauplii with LC 50 of 104.2 and 125.9g/ml, respectively.

1469,The role of grazing intensity and preference on grass-fungal endophyte symbiosis in a Patagonian steppe,"The symbiosis between cool-season grasses and fungi of the genus Epichloe is widespread, but highly variable in natural ecosystems. Biotic and abiotic controls underlying its distribution patterns have been difficult to establish, but might be related to a greater capacity of infected plants to deal with drought and herbivory. In this study we examined the relationship between grazing intensity and symbiosis frequency in plant species differentially preferred by herbivores. In all the grass species found in the studied Patagonian steppe, we determined the infection frequency along a grazing gradient by sheep (ungrazed, moderate- and intense-grazing). Three out of five preferred species and one out of four non-preferred species presented the symbiosis. Within the group of species having the symbiosis, intense grazing decreased the infection frequency of the preferred species while the frequency of the non-preferred species remained constant. These changes of infection frequency were correlated with changes in tiller biomass of hosts suggesting that symbiosis frequency could depend on overall plant performance. Our results suggest that high grazing intensity could weaken the relationship between these endophytes and their palatable hosts, eventually making them even more vulnerable to further grazing.

13879,Effect of Oxathiin Compounds Spray on the Reducing Oxidant Injury to Tobacco Plants,"Spray applications of two oxathiin systemic fungicides, carboxin (50% 5, 6-dihydro-2-methyl-1, 4-oxathiin-3-carboxanilide) and oxycarboxin (50% 5,6-dihydro-2-methyl-1, 4-oxathiin-3-carboxanilide-4, 4-dioxide) were tested to protect flue-cured tobacco from leaf damage induced by air pollution oxidants. Bel W3 (cigar wrapper tobacco) was used for the tests in an ozone exposure chamber, and MC (flue-cured tobacco) for the field tests, respectively. 1. Among the concentrations tested, 1,000 ppm solution of carboxin and 500 ppm solution of oxycarboxin were most effective in reducing ozone injury. Carboxin higher than 1,000 ppm however, caused yellowish chlorotic lesions in the young leaves. For escaping from ozone damage the chemicals were most effective on about 5 th day after application and not still so effective on the next day of spplication. The effect of sprayed chemicals was found to persist about 10 days. Oxycarboxin sprayed only to lower epidermal surface of a leaf produced same effect as that sprayed to both surfaces. Whereas, the protecting effect by spraying the compound only to upper epidermal surface decreased by approximately half of that by spraying to both surfaces. Those results suggest that the chemicals neither translocate from the sprayed leaves to other nor from one part to the other half beyond the midrib within a leaf. 2. Spray application of oxycarboxin in 1,500-fold diluted solution (333 ppm) was found to protect field-grown tobacco effectively from oxidant injury. The chemicals was found to produce no damage on treated leaves and no effect was detected on both yield and quality of harvested leaves as well. Carboxin and NF-69 (mixture of oxycarboxin and thiophanate-methyl in the ratio of 1: 3.67) delayed leaf maturity remarkably, although oxycarboxin produced no effect in this respect. 3. From the results obtained here, it is indicated that oxycarboxin can be applied as an effective protectant against weather fleck to flue-cured tobacco. © 1975, CROP SCIENCE SOCIETY OF JAPAN.

1233,"Identification of a Fungal 1,8-Cineole Synthase from Hypoxylon sp with Specificity Determinants in Common with the Plant Synthases","Terpenes are an important and diverse class of secondary metabolites widely produced by fungi. Volatile compound screening of a fungal endophyte collection revealed a number of isolates in the family Xylariaceae, producing a series of terpene molecules, including 1,8-cineole. This compound is a commercially important component of eucalyptus oil used in pharmaceutical applications and has been explored as a potential biofuel additive. The genes that produce terpene molecules, such as 1,8-cineole, have been little explored in fungi, providing an opportunity to explore the biosynthetic origin of these compounds. Through genome sequencing of cineole-producing isolate E7406B, we were able to identify 11 new terpene synthase genes. Expressing a subset of these genes in Escherichia coli allowed identification of the hyp3 gene, responsible for 1,8-cineole biosynthesis, the first monoterpene synthase discovered in fungi. In a striking example of convergent evolution, mutational analysis of this terpene synthase revealed an active site asparagine critical for water capture and specificity during cineole synthesis, the same mechanism used in an unrelated plant homologue. These studies have provided insight into the evolutionary relationship of fungal terpene synthases to those in plants and bacteria and further established fungi as a relatively untapped source of this important and diverse class of compounds.","Shaw, JJ; Berbasova, T; Sasaki, T; Jefferson-George, K; Spakowicz, DJ; Dunican, BF; Portero, CE; Narváez-Trujillo, A; Strobel, SA",JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY,2015,10.1074/jbc.M114.636159,0.941345366543759,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.872802398620637,0.127197601379363,0.999790797969205,2.0920203079455e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

Endophytic colonization in sterile sand: peat averaged ca. 40% higher for fungus treatments and ca. six times higher for volunteer fungi (other fungal endophytes naturally occurring in our samples), relative to sterile vermiculite. Colonization by B. bassiana and M. anisopliae was least variable in sterile vermiculite and most variable in sterile soil: sand: peat. The impact of soil sterilization on endophytic colonization was assessed in a separate experiment using six different field-collected soils.

17796,Ultrastructural Analysis of Cells From Bell Pepper (Capsicum annuum) Infected With Bell Pepper Endornavirus.,"Endornaviruses include viruses that infect fungi, oomycetes, and plants. The genome of plant endornaviruses consists of linear ssRNA ranging in size from approximately 13-18 kb and lacking capsid protein and cell-to-cell movement capability. Although, plant endornaviruses have not been shown to cause detectable changes in the plant phenotype, they have been associated with alterations of the host physiology. Except for the association of cytoplasmic vesicles with infections by Vicia faba endornavirus, effects on the plant cell ultrastructure caused by endornaviruses have not been reported. Bell pepper endornavirus (BPEV) has been identified in several pepper (Capsicum spp.) species. We conducted ultrastructural analyses of cells from two near-isogenic lines of the bell pepper (C. annuum) cv. Marengo, one infected with BPEV and the other BPEV-free, and found cellular alterations associated with BPEV-infections. Some cells of plants infected with BPEV exhibited alterations of organelles and other cell components. Affected cells were located mainly in the mesophyll and phloem tissues. Altered organelles included mitochondrion, chloroplast, and nucleus. The mitochondria from BPEV-infected plants exhibited low number of cristae and electron-lucent regions. Chloroplasts contained plastoglobules and small vesicles in the surrounding cytoplasm. Translucent regions in thylakoids were observed, as well as hypertrophy of the chloroplast structure. Many membranous vesicles were observed in the stroma along the envelope. The nuclei revealed a dilation of the nuclear envelope with vesicles and perinuclear areas. The organelle changes were accompanied by membranous structure rearrangements, such as paramural bodies and multivesicular bodies. These alterations were not observed in cells from plants of the BPEV-free line. Overall, the observed ultrastructural cell alterations associated with BPEV are similar to those caused by plant viruses and viroids and suggest some degree of parasitic interaction between BPEV and the plant host.",Otulak-Kozieł K; Kozieł E; Escalante C; Valverde RA,Frontiers in plant science,2020,10.3389/fpls.2020.00491,0.866577168447652,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.904239104698587,0.095760895301413,0.999992641333715,7.35866628465143e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the impact of the endophytic fungi EpichloA << typhina on its plant hosts' photosynthesis apparatus. Chlorophyll a fluorescence, gas exchange, immuno-blotting and spectrophotometric measurements were employed to assess photosynthetic performance, changes in pigment content and mechanisms associated with light harvesting, carbon assimilation and energy distribution in Dactylis glomerata colonized with EpichloA << typhina. According to the results presented in this study, colonization of D. glomerata results in improved photosynthesis efficiency. Additionally, we propose a new mechanism allowing plants to cope with the withdrawal of a significant fraction of its energy resources by the endophytic fungi. The abundance of LHCI, LHCII proteins as well as chlorophyll b was significantly higher in E+ plants. Malate export out of the chloroplast was shown to be increased in colonized plants.

12431,"EFFECTS OF ACREMONIUM-COENOPHIALUM INFESTATION, BERMUDAGRASS, AND NITROGEN OR CLOVER ON STEERS GRAZING TALL FESCUE PASTURES","Performance of cattle grazing tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is depressed when the grass is infested (E+) with the endophytic fungus Acremonium coenophialum Morgan-Jones and Gams. Steer performance can be improved when clover (Trifolium spp. L.) is overseeded into tall fescue pastures, and beef production/acre can be increased when bermudagrass [Cynodon dactlyon (L.) Pers.] is grown in combination with tall fescue. The objective of this study was to compare effects on steer performance of including ladino clover (T. repens L.), 'Midland' bermudagrass, or a combination of both in E+ and noninfested (E-) tall fescue pastures. Three tester steers (Bos taurus L.) per pasture grazed between April and September from 1983 through 1985. Additional cattle were used in a modified put-and-take management system to maintain similar quantity and quality of forage among pastures. Forage growth and consumption were measured by cage-and-strip methodology. Pastures with bermudagrass treatments averaged 18 and 53% bermudagrass in spring and summer, respectively. Clover content of pastures overseeded with clover was variable among treatment combinations and years and ranged from 6 to 53%. Greater average daily gains (ADG), beef production per acre, and forage dry matter consumption, and lower rectal temperatures and hair coat scores, were observed when cattle grazed E- rather than E+ tall fescue. Steer ADG was higher on E+ pastures when bermudagrass was present. Clover was equally effective in increasing ADG on E+ and E- tall fescue pastures. Bermudagrass and clover were both effective in improving steer performance and/or production on both E+ and E- tall fescue. Additionally, bermudagrass reduced somewhat the detrimental effects of E+ tall fescue.","CHESTNUT, AB; FRIBOURG, HA; MCLAREN, JB; KELTNER, DG; REDDICK, BB; CARLISLE, RJ; SMITH, MC",JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION AGRICULTURE,1991,10.2134/jpa1991.0208,0.948406174196982,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995236605710705,0.00476339428929495,0.999999974525912,2.54740879501725e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
4246,From laboratory to field: applying the Fo47 biocontrol strain in potato fields,"Endophytic microbes conferring biocontrol are an eco-friendly alternative to control diseases in crops. Unfortunately, the use of endophytes to control diseases is not yet widespread as their application in agricultural settings is challenging and the outcome variable. Translating strains that perform well under laboratory conditions to the field poses several challenges. One is large scale inoculum production in a cost-effective manner. Here, we developed a framework to scale up inoculum production ofFusarium oxysporum47 (Fo47), assess inoculum viability and its performance in the field and effects on potato yield and performance. The Fo47 endophyte is a well-described biocontrol agent, isolated from disease suppressive soils in the 1980's. Using mung bean medium, we could routinely produce approximate to 7 x 10(8)spores/mL. Using 60 mL of 10(7)spores/mL per tuber we could re-isolate the fungus 79 days after application from 60 to 70% of the inoculated plants in a large-scale potato field trial (Clenze, Germany). Furthermore, this protocol can be used to assess Fo47 biocontrol potential under field conditions. The presence of the fungus did not negatively affect plant yield or starch production and did not increase susceptibility to endemic pathogens.","Constantin, ME; de Lamo, FJ; Rep, M; Takken, FLW",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY,2020,10.1007/s10658-020-02106-6,0.886414009125515,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.847682916303593,0.152317083696407,0.998994214231372,0.00100578576862786,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
4911,Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae endophytically colonize cassava roots following soil drench inoculation,"We investigated the fungal entomopathogens Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae to determine if endophytic colonization could be achieved in cassava. An inoculation method based on drenching the soil around cassava stem cuttings using conidial suspensions resulted in endophytic colonization of cassava roots by both entomopathogens, though neither was found in the leaves or stems of the treated cassava plants. Both fungal entomopathogens were detected more often in the proximal end of the root than in the distal end. Colonization levels of B. bassiana were higher when plants were sampled at 7-9 days post-inoculation (84%) compared to 47-49 days post-inoculation (40%). In contrast, the colonization levels of M. anisopliae remained constant from 7-9 days post -inoculation (80%) to 47-49 days post inoculation (80%), which suggests M. anisopliae is better able to persist in the soil, or as an endophyte in cassava roots over time. Differences in colonization success and plant growth were found among the fungal entomopathogen treatments. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

8810,"Baseline Analysis of Endophytic Fungal Associates of Solenopsis invicta Buren from Mounds across Five Counties of Guangdong Province, China","Red imported fire ants mounds have been suggested as a potential reservoir for beneficial entomopathogenic fungal species that are vital for more complex roles in the ecosystem aside from infecting the insects. In the current study, the assemblage of fungal symbionts of the red imported fire ants (RIFA) were obtained across five cities in Guangdong Province, China. The sampling areas were selected because of high occurrence of fire ants mounds in the regions. Mound soils, plant debris within mounds, and ants were collected from three sampling locations in each city for potential isolation of entomopathogenic fungal associates of RIFA. All samples were collected during the spring of 2021. Following successful isolation from substrates, the patterns of fungal species composition, and richness were evaluated. In total, 843 isolates were recovered, and based on their phenotypic distinctiveness and molecular characterization based on DNA sequences of multiple loci including the ITS, SSU, and LSU regions, 46 fungal taxa were obtained, including 12 that were unidentified. Species richness and abundance was highest in the mound soils, while the lowest value was recorded from the ant body. As per the different locations, the highest abundance level was recorded in Zhuhai, where 15 fungal taxa were cultivated. The most common taxa across all substrates and locations was Talaromyces diversus. A baseline analysis of the fungal community composition of RIFA would better our understanding on the interactions between these social ants and their associated microbial organisms, and this knowledge in turn would be important for the successful management of the RIFA.","Bamisile, BS; Siddiqui, JA; Nie, L; Idrees, A; Aguila, LCR; Jia, CS; Xu, YJ",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2023,10.3390/jof9030377,0.981497086886236,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999328383470151,6.7161652984865e-4,0.999999999760371,2.39628761278254e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Against numerous ailments, plants have served as a source of bioactive compounds for centuries. However, it is not the plants themselves, but the microorganisms associated with them that offer material and products with high therapeutic potential. Endophytes are organisms that colonize internal plant tissues without causing disease symptoms. They constitute an endosymbiotic group of microorganisms which are the source of innovative natural products for use in modern industry, agriculture and medicine, indicating potential therapeutic properties, including anti-cancer and antimicrobial, as well as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Endophytic fungi are a rich source of bioactive metabolites that can be manipulated to obtain to produce desirable the desired new analogs used in chemotherapy, including: taxol, camptothecin, podophyllotoxin, vinblastine, vincristine, cytochalasin and many others.

It is considered a versatile fungus because of its global distribution, its high genotypic and phenotypic variability, and its growth under high pressure, high cosmic radiation, as well as aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The versatility of S. commune is also evident from the fact that it normally grows as a saprophyte on a wide variety of plant waste including wood but that it also can be a pathogen of plants and animals and may be an endophyte as well. Apart from its biology, S. commune is also versatile because it is a model system for mushroom formation, mycelium materials, and cell wall architecture and composition, while it also produces molecules of interest for medical and industrial applications.","Kleijburg, FEL; Wosten, HAB",FUNGAL BIOLOGY REVIEWS,2025,10.1016/j.fbr.2025.100431,0.959220644814718,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.954778476123738,0.0452215238762616,0.999986665304058,1.33346959422243e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5441,Bacillales Members from the Olive Rhizosphere Are Effective Biological Control Agents against the Defoliating Pathotype of Verticillium dahliae,"The use of biological control agents (BCAs) is of interest within an integrated management strategy of Verticillium wilt of olive (VWO) caused by the soil-borne fungus Verticillium dahliae Kleb. Previous studies have shown that the root/rhizosphere of healthy olive plants is an important reservoir of microorganisms displaying biocontrol activity against VWO (i.e., Pseudomonas strains PICF7 and PIC141). Moreover, these BCAs are already adapted to the ecological niche where they are deployed. Three novel bacteria (strains PIC28, PIC73 and PIC167) from nursery-produced olive plants were in-depth characterized using a previously implemented approach consisting of in situ isolation, in vitro antagonism tests, in planta bioassays, phenotypic and metabolic characterization, genome analyses and in silico identification of traits involved in plant-bacteria interactions, and multi-locus sequence analyses. All strains displayed in vitro growth inhibition of different olive pathogens and biocontrol effectiveness against Verticillium dahliae, with strain PIC73 being the most effective BCA. Strains PIC73 and PIC167 were identified as Paenibacillus polymyxa (Prazmowski) Ash et al. and Paenibacillus terrae Yoon et al., respectively. Strain PIC28 belongs to the Bacillus genus. Some of these Bacillales members showed in vitro compatibility with previously characterized BCAs (Pseudomonas spp. strains) also originating from the olive rhizosphere, paving the way for the future development of tailored bacterial consortia effective against VWO.","Cabanás, CGL; Ruano-Rosa, D; Legarda, G; Pizarro-Tobías, P; Valverde-Corredor, A; Triviño, JC; Roca, A; Mercado-Blanco, J",AGRICULTURE-BASEL,2018,10.3390/agriculture8070090,0.949158604135681,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990296642119867,0.0097033578801325,0.999944685314341,5.53146856591136e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Combined analysis of ITS, gapdh, chs-1, act, and tub2 sequence data coupled with Genealogical Concordance Phylogenetic Species Recognition Analysis (GCPSRA) supported the two strains as two distinct species within the gloeosporioides species complex. The three Colletotrichum species were compared and differentiated with closely related taxa. Koch's postulates were proven, demonstrating that C. avicenniae, C. lumnitzerae, and C. tropicale cause anthracnose leaf spots in mangroves.

2507,Antifungal Activity and Effect of Plant-Associated Bacteria on Phenolic Synthesis of Quercus robur L.,"Europe's forests, particularly in Ukraine, are highly vulnerable to climate change. The maintenance and improvement of forest health are high-priority issues, and various stakeholders have shown an interest in understanding and utilizing ecological interactions between trees and their associated microorganisms. Endophyte microbes can influence the health of trees either by directly interacting with the damaging agents or modulating host responses to infection. In the framework of this work, ten morphotypes of endophytic bacteria from the tissues of unripe acorns of Quercus robur L. were isolated. Based on the results of the sequenced 16S rRNA genes, four species of endophytic bacteria were identified: Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus subtilis, Delftia acidovorans, and Lelliottia amnigena. Determining the activity of pectolytic enzymes showed that the isolates B. subtilis and B. amyloliquefaciens could not cause maceration of plant tissues. Screening for these isolates revealed their fungistatic effect against phytopathogenic micromycetes, namely Fusarium tricinctum, Botrytis cinerea, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Inoculation of B. subtilis, B. amyloliquefaciens, and their complex in oak leaves, in contrast to phytopathogenic bacteria, contributed to the complete restoration of the epidermis at the sites of damage. The phytopathogenic bacteria Pectobacterium and Pseudomonas caused a 2.0 and 2.2 times increase in polyphenol concentration in the plants, respectively, while the ratio of antioxidant activity to total phenolic content decreased. Inoculation of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Bacillus subtilis isolates into oak leaf tissue were accompanied by a decrease in the total pool of phenolic compounds. The ratio of antioxidant activity to total phenolic content increased. This indicates a qualitative improvement in the overall balance of the oak leaf antioxidant system induced by potential PGPB. Thus, endophytic bacteria of the genus Bacillus isolated from the internal tissues of unripe oak acorns have the ability of growth biocontrol and spread of phytopathogens, indicating their promise for use as biopesticides.","Bilous, S; Likhanov, A; Boroday, V; Marchuk, Y; Zelena, L; Subin, O; Bilous, A",PLANTS-BASEL,2023,10.3390/plants12061352,0.997883931157055,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995223654366299,0.00477634563370147,0.999999999924616,7.538381030514069e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11543,Fungi associated with dieback of Abies alba seedlings in naturally regenerating forest ecosystems,"Dieback of young Abies alba seedlings was identified as an important limitation for natural regeneration of this species in the mountain regions of Central Europe. Approximately 2-4 weeks after emergence, during cool and wet weather, necrotic spots developed on seedling cotyledons. Later they expanded and merged to finally cover all above-ground tissues. Symptomatic seedlings of A. alba were sampled at 16 stands, and fungi were isolated from the cotyledons, stems, and roots. Morphological and molecular methods based on ITS rDNA sequencing were then used for isolate identification. In total, 105 distinct taxa were identified, with Ascomycota dominating, representing 97.4% of the isolates. The most frequently isolated taxa were Allantophomopsis lycopodina, Gyoerffyella rotula, Leptosphaeria sp., Phialocephala fortinii, Pseudaegerita sp., Scirrhia aspidiontm, Sydowia polyspora, Peyronellaea sp., Phomopsis sp., and Varicosporium elodeae. The frequency of colonization by individual fungal species differed among the three plant organs and among forest types. In symptomatic cotyledons, the dominant species were G. rotula, S. polyspora, and Pseudaegerita sp. whose pathogenicity, together with that of Gyoerffyella sp., V. elodeae, and Hormonema carpetanum, was tested on young A. alba seedlings. Only G. rotula and Gyoerffyella sp. caused serious dieback of above -ground seedling tissues and necrotic symptoms on cotyledons.

13299,"Reprint of ""Conservation biological control and enemy diversity on a landscape scale"" [Biol. Control 43 (2007) 294-309]","Conservation biological control in agroecosystems requires a landscape management perspective, because most arthropod species experience their habitat at spatial scales beyond the plot level, and there is spillover of natural enemies across the crop-noncrop interface. The species pool in the surrounding landscape and the distance of crop from natural habitat are important for the conservation of enemy diversity and, in particular, the conservation of poorly-dispersing and specialized enemies. Hence, structurally complex landscapes with high habitat connectivity may enhance the probability of pest regulation. In contrast, generalist and highly vagile enemies may even profit from the high primary productivity of crops at a landscape scale and their abundance may partly compensate for losses in enemy diversity. Conservation biological control also needs a multitrophic perspective. For example, entomopathogenic fungi, plant pathogens and endophytes as well as below- and above-ground microorganisms are known to influence pest-enemy interactions in ways that vary across spatiotemporal scales. Enemy distribution in agricultural landscapes is determined by beta diversity among patches. The diversity needed for conservation biological control may occur where patch heterogeneity at larger spatial scales is high. However, enemy communities in managed systems are more similar across space and time than those in natural systems, emphasizing the importance of natural habitat for a spillover of diverse enemies. According to the insurance hypothesis, species richness can buffer against spatiotemporal disturbances, thereby insuring functioning in changing environments. Seemingly redundant enemy species may become important under global change. Complex landscapes characterized by highly connected crop-noncrop mosaics may be best for long-term conservation biological control and sustainable crop production, but experimental evidence for detailed recommendations to design the composition and configuration of agricultural landscapes that maintain a diversity of generalist and specialist natural enemies is still needed. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

11153,Biochemical and physiological responses of rice (Oryza sativa L.) as influenced by Trichoderma harzianum under drought stress,"Rice is one of the most important food crops drastically affected by drought in lowland rice ecosystems. In the present study, the impact of drought tolerant isolates of endophytic fungus Trichoderma harzianum on rice response to drought was investigated. Out of 43 Trichoderma isolates studied, only five isolates viz., Th 56, Th 69, Th 75, Th 82 and Th 89 were selected to be drought tolerant as these were able to colonize well on cow dung at low moisture content of 10-20 percent, though two isolates, Th 56 and Th 75, grew even at 5 percent moisture content. Trichoderma-colonized rice seedlings were slower to wilt in response to drought. Colonization delayed drought induced changes like stomatal conductance, net photosynthesis and leaf greenness. Drought conditions varying from 3 to 9 days of withholding water led to an increase in the concentration of many stress induced metabolites in rice leaves and decrease of MSI, while Trichoderma colonization caused a decrease in proline, MDA and H2O2 contents, and increase in phenolics concentration and MSI. Among test isolates, Th 56 induced maximum drought tolerance as treated plants recorded only 20-40 percent wilting even at 9 DDS. With or without exposure to drought, colonization by Trichoderma promoted seedling growth, with Th 56 giving the most consistent effect. The primary direct effect of Trichoderma colonization was promotion of root growth, regardless of water status, which caused delay in the drought responses of rice plants.

16991,Quantitative real-time PCR for detection and identification of Candidatus Liberibacter species associated with citrus huanglongbing.,"Citrus huanglongbing (HLB, ex greening) is one of the most serious diseases of citrus. Different forms of the disease are caused by different Candidatus Liberobacter species, Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las), Ca. L. africanus (Laf) and Ca. L. americanus (Lam). The pathogen is transmitted by psyllid insects and by budding with contaminated plant materials. The vector psyllid Diaphorina citri can transmit both Las and Lam. Establishment of this vector into Florida, reports of Lam and Las in Brazil in 2004, and recent confirmation of HLB in Florida in September 2005 is of great concern to the citrus industry. Research on HLB has been hampered by the unculturable nature of the causal bacterium in artificial media. It has also been difficult to detect and identify the pathogens, possibly because of low concentration and uneven distribution in host plants and vector psyllids. In this study, we developed quantitative TaqMan PCR using 16S rDNA-based TaqMan primer-probe sets specific to the different Ca. Liberobacter spp. An additional primer-probe set based on plant cytochrome oxidase (COX) was used as a positive internal control to assess the quality of the DNA extracts. The assays do not cross-react with other pathogens or endophytes commonly resident in citrus plants, and are very sensitive. HLB pathogen DNA was successfully amplified from the equivalent of 20 ng of midrib tissue from symptomatic leaves. The consistent results of the assays with DNA extracted from plants infected by various Ca. Liberibacter species grown in greenhouses and in the field demonstrated a degree of reproducibility for these TaqMan assays. Inhibitors of the PCR that are frequently present in plant extracts did not affect the assay results. The population of the pathogens was estimated to be 5 x 10(7) and 2 x 10(6) cells/g of fresh midribs of symptomatic sweet orange leaves infected by Las and Lam, respectively. The ratio of pathogen DNA to host plant DNA was estimated by to be 1:13,000 (w/w) and 1:1000 (c/c: target copy/target copy) in DNA extracts obtained by a standard CTAB method. Our rapid, sensitive and specific TaqMan PCR assay for the detection, identification and quantification of Ca.

Some of these isolates were collected from shrimp ponds exhibiting early mortality syndrome (EMS) and diagnosed as outbreaks of acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) that is caused by specific isolates of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (VPAHPND). Cell-free supernatants (CFS) of two fungal isolates (MCR433 and MCR 440) that inhibited biofilm growth for at least 5 out of the 7 Vibrio isolates were chosen for further study in shrimp feeding trials. One (MCR433) had strong biofilm inhibition and the other (MCR 440) weak biofilm inhibition for VPAHPND. Feed supplementation with CFS of MCR 433 protected shrimp against AHPND (72% mean survival) when compared to control shrimp given un-supplemented feed (20% mean survival) or given feed supplemented with CFS of MCR 440 (0% survival). Histological analysis of the hepatopancreas confirmed that shrimp given feed supplemented with MCR 433 showed little or no signs of AHPND pathology while shrimp in the other two groups showed histopathology typical AHPND. Using a multigene molecular typing approach, both MCR 433 and MCR 440 were identified as distinct members of the order Muyocopronales, class Dothideomycetes and phylum Ascomycota with differing biological activities. Further research is needed on the lead compounds generated by these strains. Those from MCR 433 have potential for use as feed additives against VPAHPND as an alternative to antibiotics.","Dadi, NCT; Yatip, P; Krataitong, K; Unagul, P; Suetrong, S; Preedanon, S; Klaysuban, A; Sangtiean, T; Sakayaroj, J; Soowannayan, C",AQUACULTURE,2022,10.1016/j.aquaculture.2021.737528,0.999153239842213,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990100387344183,0.00989961265581666,0.999998374558285,1.62544171466994e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5597,Comparison of the intestinal flora of wild and artificial breeding green turtles (Chelonia mydas),"Gut microbes are pivotal reference indicators for assessing the health status of animals. Before introducing artificially bred species into the wild, examining their gut microbe composition is crucial to help mitigate potential threats posed to wild populations. However, gut microbiological trait similarities between wild and artificially bred green turtles remain unexplored. Therefore, this study compared the gut microbiological characteristics of wild and artificially bred green turtles (Chelonia mydas) through high-throughput Illumina sequencing technology. The alpha-diversity of intestinal bacteria in wild green turtles, as determined by Shannon and Chao indices, significantly surpasses that of artificial breeding green turtles (p < 0.01). However, no significant differences were detected in the fungal alpha-diversity between wild and artificially bred green turtles. Meanwhile, the beta-diversity analysis revealed significant differences between wild and artificially bred green turtles in bacterial and fungal compositions. The community of gut bacteria in artificially bred green turtles had a significantly higher abundance of Fusobacteriota including those belonging to the Paracoccus, Cetobacterium, and Fusobacterium genera than that of the wild green turtle. In contrast, the abundance of bacteria belonging to the phylum Actinobacteriota and genus Nautella significantly decreased. Regarding the fungal community, artificially bred green turtles had a significantly higher abundance of Fusarium, Sterigmatomyces, and Acremonium and a lower abundance of Candida and Rhodotorula than the wild green turtle. The PICRUSt2 analyses demonstrated significant differences in the functions of the gut bacterial flora between groups, particularly in carbohydrate and energy metabolism. Fungal functional guild analysis further revealed that the functions of the intestinal fungal flora of wild and artificially bred green turtles differed significantly in terms of animal pathogens-endophytes-lichen parasites-plant pathogens-soil saprotrophs-wood saprotrophs. BugBase analysis revealed significant potential pathogenicity and stress tolerance variations between wild and artificially bred green turtles. Collectively, this study elucidates the distinctive characteristics of gut microbiota in wild and artificially bred green turtles while evaluating their health status. These findings offer valuable scientific insights for releasing artificially bred green turtles and other artificially bred wildlife into natural habitats.","Niu, X; Lin, L; Zhang, T; An, XY; Li, YP; Yu, YF; Hong, ML; Shi, HT; Ding, L",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2024,10.3389/fmicb.2024.1412015,0.962240245038865,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999717967065486,2.8203293451446e-4,0.999999999988331,1.1669443189532598e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3797,Epichloe<spacing diaeresis> endophyte-infected Lolium perenne experienced less oxidative damage when exposed to drought stress,"This research aimed to assess the impacts of varying drought stress periods of one week (time 1), two weeks (time 2), and at the end of the stress period (time 3) on growth, oxidative stress indicators (H2O2, MDA), and antioxidant enzyme responses (catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, guaiacol peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase) among six endophyte-infected (E+) and four endophyte-free (E-) genotypes of the plant species Lolium perenne. The experiment was designed in a completely randomized design with three replications. In the pot culture, a one-month drought stress was induced by limiting irrigation to 20 % of the field capacity for both E+ and E- L. perenne genotypes. The results demonstrated that endophyte infection could provide substantial physiological benefits to the host plant under drought stress conditions. Infected genotypes exhibited higher dry weight of aerial and root biomass, tiller numbers, and chlorophyll a content compared to control plants. At time 1, H2O2 concentrations were significantly higher in E- genotypes. The highest MDA levels were observed in E- genotypes at time 3. The activity of antioxidant enzymes involved in H2O2 degradation (CAT, APX, GOP) and the enzyme responsible for H2O2 production (SOD) was most pronounced in time 2 for E+ genotypes. Furthermore, drought stress induced the activity of GR and GST enzymes in the leaves of both E+ and E- Lolium genotypes, with the highest induction of these enzymes occurring two weeks after stress in E+ genotypes. These findings suggest that the antioxidant strategies of E+ Lolium genotypes are significantly altered when exposed to drought stress for two weeks. Although both E+ and E- genotypes demonstrated effective antioxidant responses, the E+ genotypes experienced less oxidative damage, highlighting the enhanced morphophysiological performance due to endophyte infection.","Raeisi-Vanani, F; Shabani, L; Sabzalian, MR; Sharifi-Tehrani, M",RHIZOSPHERE,2025,10.1016/j.rhisph.2025.101059,0.808167449443559,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.936656983299262,0.0633430167007378,0.999999999935793,6.420675102702939e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10915,Response of Endophytic Microbial Communities and Quality of Salvia miltiorrhiza to Fertilization Treatments,"Salvia miltiorrhiza is a traditional herbal remedy for cardiovascular diseases and is in high demand in the market. Excessive chemical fertilizer application, resulting from unscientific fertilization practices, reduced the tanshinone content in S. miltiorrhiza roots. This study investigated how different fertilization types alter the endophytic microbial community composition of S. miltiorrhiza through field experiments, aiming to understand how fertilization affects its medicinal quality. The results showed that root fertilizers (F1) significantly increased root biomass and tanshinone I content, whereas foliar fertilizers (F2) increased tanshinone IIA content. High-throughput sequencing further revealed that F2 treatment significantly decreased the Shannon index of endophytic bacteria while significantly increasing the Shannon index of endophytic fungi. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that fertilization significantly altered fungal community complexity and modularity, with F1 increasing network nodes and edges. Variance partitioning analysis indicated fungal diversity more strongly influenced medicinal compound levels under F2 and a combination of both (F3) than bacterial diversity. Septoria and Gibberella were positively correlated with tanshinone I and cryptotanshinone content under F2 treatment, respectively. Notably, the unique strains were isolated from different fertilization treatments for subsequent bacterial fertilizer development. These findings elucidate microbial responses to fertilization, guiding optimized cultivation for improved S. miltiorrhiza quality.","Chen, WJ; Li, WY; Pan, YY; Zheng, X; Fu, XX; Wang, MH; Shi, WY; Wang, ZZ; He, XL; He, C; Li, XE",MICROORGANISMS,2025,10.3390/microorganisms13061429,0.903892878970991,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.972157425185235,0.0278425748147649,0.999999927156781,7.28432185681527e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10663,Box-Behnken design optimization of xylanase and cellulase production by Aspergillus fumigatus on Stipa tenacissima biomass,"Optimization of xylanase and cellulase production by a newly isolated Aspergillus fumigatus strain grown on Stipa tenacissima (alfa grass) biomass without pretreatment was carried out using a Box-Behnken design. First, the polysaccharides of dried and ground alfa grass were characterized using chemical methods (strong and diluted acid). The effect of substrate particle size on xylanase and carboxymethylcellulase (CMCase) production by the selected and identified strain was then investigated. Thereafter, experiments were statistically planned with a Box-Behnken design to optimize initial pH, cultivation temperature, moisture content, and incubation period using alfa as sole carbon source. The effect of these parameters on the two enzyme production was evaluated using the response surface method. Analysis of variance was also carried out, and production of the enzymes was expressed using a mathematical equation depending on the influencing factors. The effects of individual, interaction, and square terms on production of both enzymes were represented using the nonlinear regression equations with significant R-2 and P-values. Xylanase and CMCase production levels were enhanced by 25% and 27%, respectively. Thus, this study demonstrated for the first time the potential of alfa as a raw material to produce enzymes without any pretreatment. A set of parameter combinations was found to be effective for the production of xylanase and CMCase by A. fumigatus in an alfa-based solid-state fermentation.","Gares, M; Benaissa, A; Hiligsmann, S; Cherfia, R; Flahaut, S; Alloun, W; Djelid, H; Chaoua, S; Chaouche, NK",MYCOLOGIA,2023,10.1080/00275514.2023.2205331,0.99804405499705,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.976264507116858,0.0237354928831421,0.999999592026644,4.07973355875946e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6543,Preinoculation with Endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris reduced rice bakanae disease caused by Fusarium proliferatum via enhanced plant resistance,"Aims This study evaluated the control effect of the endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris B3 against rice bakanae disease (RBD) caused by Fusarium proliferatum and the disease control result of different inoculation times of beneficial micro-organisms. Methods and Results Rice seedlings preinoculated, coinoculated and noninoculated with B3 were exposed to F. proliferatum stress and grown under controlled conditions. Greenhouse experimental results showed that rice preinoculation with B3 significantly reduced rice bakanae disease by 21.45%, inhibited the colonization of F. proliferatum, increased defence-related enzyme activities, upregulated the expression of defence genes and promoted plant photosynthesis. However, bakanae disease in rice coinoculation with B3 increased by 11.45%, resulted in excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) bursts and plant cell death. Conclusions Preinoculation with the endophytic fungus P. liquidambaris B3 significantly reduced rice bakanae disease by triggering the SA-dependent defence pathways of plants, and promoted plant growth. However, coinoculatiton with P. liquidambaris B3 activated excessive defence responses, resulting in plants cell death and aggravation of bakanae disease. Significance and Impact of the Study This study indicated that P. liquidambaris B3 was an effective method for agricultural control against rice bakanae disease caused by F. proliferatum, and provides an experimental basis for the development of sustainable endophytic fungal resources to effectively control plant diseases caused by pathogenic fungi, and suggests that precise application of beneficial micro-organisms may be become a key factor in farmland crop disease management.","Zhu, Q; Wu, YB; Chen, M; Lu, F; Sun, K; Tang, MJ; Zhang, W; Bu, YQ; Dai, CC",JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY,2022,10.1111/jam.15656,0.994017917736675,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998174176570564,0.00182582342943588,0.999999962696296,3.7303704236713e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

724,A fungal endophyte defensive symbiosis affects plant-nematode interactions in cotton,"Most investigations of fungi as nematode antagonists have focused on their interactions with nematodes in the soil. This study tested a foliar-isolated endophytic Phialemonium inflatum for its effects against the root-knot nematode as an endophyte in cotton using a seed treatment inoculation. Cotton seeds were inoculated with P. inflatum spore suspensions prior to planting. Nematode infection and reproduction were quantified at Day 12 and 6 weeks after nematode egg inoculation, respectively. To establish whether the observed negative effects on nematodes were due to P. inflatum in the soil or as an endophyte in the plant, we also applied a soil fungicide treatment at the seedling stage to kill the fungi outside the plant. Persistent suppression of nematode penetration and galling, as well as subsequent reproduction, were observed in endophyte-treated plants independent of fungicide treatment, consistent with an endophytic mode of nematode suppression; and these negative effects did not depend on the concentration of fungal inoculum used to treat to the seed. Our study highlights a novel role for P. inflatum as part of a plant-fungal defensive symbiosis in cotton, as well as the need for a broader understanding of endophyte-plant-nematode ecological interactions.","Zhou, WQ; Wheeler, TA; Starr, JL; Valencia, CU; Sword, GA",PLANT AND SOIL,2018,10.1007/s11104-016-3147-z,0.997816005857667,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99981747751174,1.8252248826034e-4,0.99999999759238,2.40762043635101e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Summary of future research direction 1007 Acknowledgements 1006 References 1006 SUMMARY: Mycorrhizal symbiosis is an ancient and widespread mutualism between plants and fungi that facilitated plant terrestrialisation > 500 million years ago, with key roles in ecosystem functioning at multiple scales. Central to the symbiosis is the bidirectional exchange of plant-fixed carbon for fungal-acquired nutrients. Within this unifying role of mycorrhizas, considerable diversity in structure and function reflects the diversity of the partners involved. Early diverging plants form mutualisms not only with arbuscular mycorrhizal Glomeromycotina fungi, but also with poorly characterised Mucoromycotina, which may also colonise the roots of 'higher' plants as fine root endophytes. Functional diversity in these symbioses depends on both fungal and plant life histories and is influenced by the environment. Recent studies have highlighted the roles of lipids/fatty acids in plant-to-fungus carbon transport and potential contributions of Glomeromycotina fungi to plant nitrogen nutrition. Together with emerging appreciation of mycorrhizal networks as multi-species resource-sharing systems, these insights are broadening our views on mycorrhizas and their roles in nutrient cycling. It is crucial that the diverse array of biotic and abiotic factors that together shape the dynamics of carbon-for-nutrient exchange between plants and fungi are integrated, in addition to embracing the unfolding and potentially key role of Mucoromycotina fungi in these processes.",Field KJ; Pressel S,The New phytologist,2018,10.1111/nph.15158,0.980014724220589,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997041742553958,0.00295825744604223,0.999998923144699,1.07685530104096e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

17192,Alternaria brassicicola Causes a Leaf Spot on Isatis indigotica in China.,"Chinese woad (Isatis indigotica) is a biennial herb in the Brassicaceae that is widely cultivated in China. Extracts from the roots and leaves have potential pharmaceutical use for treatment of flu, encephalitis, measles, hepatitis, and mumps (2). In June 2012, a leaf spot was observed on 1-year-old plants of I. indigotica in the medicinal garden of Jilin Agricultural University, Changchun, Jilin Province, China. More than 50% of the leaves and 100% of the plants in the garden were symptomatic. In the initial stage of infection, irregular to circular, dark gray spots, each surrounded by a chlorotic halo, appeared on leaves. The spots ranged from pinpoint to 5 mm in diameter. Some spots enlarged and coalesced, forming concentric rings. Black, sunken, fusiform lesions were observed on the petioles. Lesions gradually dried and exhibited a shot-hole appearance, and entire infected leaves desiccated. Small pieces of infected leaves and petioles were surface-disinfested in 75% ethanol for 60 s, rinsed thrice in sterilized distilled water, dried, and plated on potato dextrose agar. Olive-green mycelium developed after 2 days of incubation at 25°C, turned dark green, and covered the petri dish 10 days later. The periphery of each colony was gray and velvety. On potato carrot agar medium, conidia formed on branched chains. Conidiophores arose singly or in clusters, were straight or flexuous, separated, and measured 6.8 to 26.7 × 3.1 to 11.9 μm Conidia on host plant tissues were olivaceous, cylindrical or inverted clavate, and 25.8 to 65.2 × 10.9 to 18.3 μm Larger conidia were cylindrical or obclavate, and smaller conidia were oval. Transverse and longitudinal septa of conidia ranged from 3 to 10 and from 0 to 7 μm, respectively. A very small conidial beak or no beak was observed on each conidium. On the basis of these morphological characteristics,the fungus was identified as Alternaria brassicicola (3). A PCR assay with the ITS4 and ITS5 primers was used to amplify DNA extracted from each of four isolates (1). The sequence (567 bp) of isolate Sl-8 was submitted to GenBank (Accession No. KF531832), and showed 100% similarity to that of an A. brassicicola isolate (AF392985.1), confirming the species identification. Pathogenicity assays with 10 single-conidium isolates were done by spraying a conidial suspension (1 × 106 conidia/ml) of each isolate, or sterilized water for the control treatment, onto healthy leaves and petioles of five 3-month-old plants of I. indigotica. Inoculated and control plants were enclosed in plastic bags for 48 h. After 7 days, symptoms on inoculated plants were similar to those on the original diseased plants, while control plants remained symptomless. Re-isolation from inoculated plants produced mycelial colonies with morphological characteristics of A. brassicicola, fulfilling Koch's postulates. No fungus was isolated from control plants. A. napiformis and A. brassicae have been reported as causal agents of Alternaria leaf spot on I. indigotica in China (3). To our knowledge, however, this is the first report of A. brassicicola as a pathogen on I. indigotica in China. References: (1) N. L. Glass and G. C. Donaldson. Appl. Environ.

12188,Suppressive effects of seed-applied fungicides on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) differ with fungicide mode of action and AMF species,"Seed-applied fungicides are commonly used to prevent or suppress fungal disease organisms in pulse crop production. However, non-target beneficial fungi, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), also may be affected. Seed-applied fungicides Agrox (R) FL (active ingredient: captan), Allegiance (TM) FL (metalaxyl), Apron Maxx (R) RTA (R) (fludioxonil and metalaxyl), Thiram 75WP (thiram), Vitaflo (R) 280 (carbathiin and thiram), Crown (R) (carbathiin and thiabendazole), and Trilex (R) AL (trifloxystrobin and metalaxyl) were assessed in a greenhouse study for their effects on colonization and development of AMF in pea and chickpea, and the consequent impact on plant growth. In the absence of disease pressure, systemic fungicides Allegiance (TM) FL, Apron Maxx (R) RTA (R), Vitaflo (R) 280, Crown (R) and Trilex (R) AL restricted mycorrhizal colonization, host growth and P uptake to different levels. In contrast, contact fungicides Agrox FL and Thiram 75WP had minimal effects on mycorrhizal colonization, host growth and P uptake. Although consequent sporulation and glomalin-related protein production were not significantly affected by fungicides at an early host growth stage, the compositional structure of the AMF community in host roots was significantly altered in response to Agrox (R) FL, Allegiance (TM) FL, Apron Maxx (R) RTA (R), and Trilex (R) AL as revealed by pyrosequencing-based analysis of fungal 18S rRNA. These results indicate that the suppressive effects of seed-applied fungicides on AMF development depend on specific fungicide-AMF interactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

890,"An Endohyphal Bacterium (Chitinophaga, Bacteroidetes) Alters Carbon Source Use by Fusarium keratoplasticum(F-solani Species Complex, Nectriaceae)","Bacterial endosymbionts occur in diverse fungi, including members of many lineages of Ascomycota that inhabit living plants. These endosymbiotic bacteria (endohyphal bacteria, EHB) often can be removed from living fungi by antibiotic treatment, providing an opportunity to assess their effects on functional traits of their fungal hosts. We examined the effects of an endohyphal bacterium (Chitinophaga sp., Bacteroidetes) on substrate use by its host, a seed-associated strain of the fungus Fusarium keratoplasticum, by comparing growth between naturally infected and cured fungal strains across 95 carbon sources with a Biolog((R)) phenotypic microarray. Across the majority of substrates (62%), the strain harboring the bacterium significantly outperformed the cured strain as measured by respiration and hyphal density. These substrates included many that are important for plant-and seed fungus interactions, such as D-trehalose, myoinositol, and sucrose, highlighting the potential influence of EHB on the breadth and efficiency of substrate use by an important Fusariurn species. Cases in which the cured strain outperformed the strain harboring the bacterium were observed in only 5% of substrates. We propose that additive or synergistic substrate use by the fungus bacterium pair enhances fungal growth in this association. More generally, alteration of the breadth or efficiency of substrate use by dispensable EHB may change fungal niches in short timeframes, potentially shaping fungal ecology and the outcomes of fungal-host interactions.","Shaffer, JP; U'Ren, JM; Gallery, RE; Baltrus, DA; Arnold, AE",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2017,10.3389/fmicb.2017.00350,0.938788914137719,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999996837449532,3.16255046833451e-6,0.999999987472232,1.25277683782343e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1711,Novel and highly diverse fungal endophytes in soybean revealed by the consortium of two different techniques,"Fungal endophytes were isolated from the leaves of soybean cultivars in Brazil using two different isolation techniques - fragment plating and the innovative dilution-to-extinction culturing - to increase the species richness, frequency of isolates and diversity. A total of 241 morphospecies were obtained corresponding to 62 taxa that were identified by analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA). The Phylum Ascomycota predominated, representing 99% and 95.2% of isolates in the Monsoy and Conquista cultivars, respectively, whereas the Phylum Basidiomycota represented 1% and 4.8% of isolates, respectively. The genera Ampelomyces, Annulohypoxylon, Guignardia, Leptospora, Magnaporthe, Ophiognomonia, Paraconiothyrium, Phaeosphaeriopsis, Rhodotorula, Sporobolomyces, and Xylaria for the first time were isolated from soybean; this suggests that soybean harbours novel and highly diverse fungi. The yeasts genera Rhodotorula and Sporobolomyces (subphylum Pucciniomycotina) represent the Phylum Basidiomycota. The species richness was greater when both isolation techniques were used. The diversity of fungal endophytes was similar in both cultivars when the same isolation technique was used except for Hill's index, N-1. The use of ITS region sequences allowed the isolates to be grouped according to Order, Class and Phylum. Ampelomyces, Chaetomium, and Phoma glomerata are endophytic species that may play potential roles in the biological control of soybean pathogens. This study is one of the first to apply extinction-culturing to isolate fungal endophytes in plant leaves, thus contributing to the development and improvement of this technique for future studies.","Leite, TD; Cnossen-Fassoni, A; Pereira, OL; Mizubuti, ESG; de Araujo, EF; de Queiroz, MV",JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY,2013,10.1007/s12275-013-2356-x,0.877379820322597,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.554121791782092,0.445878208217908,0.968741879498727,0.0312581205012733,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

Generally isolation of these two endophytes from green needles increased with needle age. This was supported by both culturing of the endophytes on media and the total ergosterol content of needles. Statistically significant correlations were obtained between the two techniques on some sampling occasions. Over the three year experimental period there was markedly higher isolation frequency of R.kalkhoffii from the poor growth/polluted site than from the good growth/unpolluted site. This was less apparent for L.piceae.

9048,"Production, Optimization, Characterization and Drought Stress Resistance by β-Glucan-Rich Heteropolysaccharide From an Endophytic Fungi Colletotrichum alatae LCS1 Isolated From Clubmoss (Lycopodium clavatum)","Endophytic entities are ubiquitous in nature with all-square bioactivity ranging from therapeutic effects toward animals to growth promoting attributes and stress tolerance activities in case of green plants. In the present study, the club moss Lycopodium clavatum for the first time has been subjected for the isolation of endophytic fungi. An exopolysaccharide (EPS) extracted from Colletotrichum alatae LCS1, an endophytic fungi isolated from L. clavatum Linn., was characterized as a beta-glucan heteropolymer (composed of mannose, rhamnose, arabinose, glucose, galactose, and fucose) which plays a pivotal role in obliterating the drought stress in rice seedlings (Oryza sativa) when applied at an amount of 20, 50, and 100 ppm. The fresh weight contents of rice tissue (39%), total chlorophyll (33%), proline (41%), soluble sugar content (26%) along with antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, peroxidase, and super-oxide dismutase increased (in comparison to control of non-EPS treated seedlings) while malondialdehyde content had reduced markedly after 30 days of regular treatment. The drought resistance of rice seedling was observed at peak when applied at 50 ppm dosage. Vital parameters for EPS production like fermentation duration (5 days), medium pH (6), nutrient (carbon (glucose-7 g%/l), nitrogen (yeast extract-0.4 g%/l), andmineral (NaCl-0.10 g%/l) sources, oxygen requirements (O-2 vector or liquid alkane-n-hexane, n-heptane, n-hexadecane), and headspace volume (250ml Erlenmeyer flask-50ml medium, 200 ml-headspace volume) were optimized to obtain an enhanced EPS yield of 17.38 g/L-59% higher than the preoptimized one.

11460,Genetic Mapping of the Root Mycobiota in Rice and its Role in Drought Tolerance,"BackgroundRice is the second most produced crop worldwide, but is highly susceptible to drought. Micro-organisms can potentially alleviate the effects of drought. The aim of the present study was to unravel the genetic factors involved in the rice-microbe interaction, and whether genetics play a role in rice drought tolerance. For this purpose, the composition of the root mycobiota was characterized in 296 rice accessions (Oryza sativa L. subsp. indica) under control and drought conditions. Genome wide association mapping (GWAS) resulted in the identification of ten significant (LOD > 4) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with six root-associated fungi: Ceratosphaeria spp., Cladosporium spp., Boudiera spp., Chaetomium spp., and with a few fungi from the Rhizophydiales order. Four SNPs associated with fungi-mediated drought tolerance were also found. Genes located around those SNPs, such as a DEFENSIN-LIKE (DEFL) protein, EXOCYST TETHERING COMPLEX (EXO70), RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR-LIKE (RALFL) protein, peroxidase and xylosyltransferase, have been shown to be involved in pathogen defense, abiotic stress responses and cell wall remodeling processes. Our study shows that rice genetics affects the recruitment of fungi, and that some fungi affect yield under drought. We identified candidate target genes for breeding to improve rice-fungal interactions and hence drought tolerance.","Andreo-Jimenez, B; te Beest, DE; Kruijer, W; Vannier, N; Kadam, NN; Melandri, G; Jagadish, SVK; van der Linden, G; Ruyter-Spira, C; Vandenkoornhuyse, P; Bouwmeester, HJ",RICE,2023,10.1186/s12284-023-00641-4,0.925403564912229,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.93433320779168,0.0656667922083195,0.999003222923942,9.9677707605816e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3597,Production of fumonisins by endophytic strains of Tolypocladium cylindrosporum and its relation to fungal virus infection,"Fumonisins were first discovered in Fusarium verticillioides, a fungus associated to disease and asymptomatic infections in maize. Afterwards, other fungal taxa have been found to produce fumonisins. The entomopathogenic ascomycete Tolypocladium cylindrosporum has been isolated from soil and also as an endophyte from leaves of grasses. The objectives of this work were to determine the in vitro production of fumonisin B (FB) mycotoxins and the immunosuppressive compound cyclosporine A (CyA) in several strains of T. cylindrosporum, and to examine the effect of fungal virus infection and temperature in FB production. FB1 was detected in 30% of the strains, ranging from 0.16 to 5.52 mu g cm(-2) in solid media, and FB2 was detected in 78% of the strains, ranging from 0.764 to 40.92 mu g cm(-2). CyA was not detected in any strain. The mean FB2 concentration of the endophytic strain Tc37W was three times greater (p < 0.05) than that of any other strain. Up to 34% more of FB2 was detected in strains infected by the virus TcV3 than in the corresponding virus-free versions. The effect of temperature on FB2 content was interactively significantly dependent on fungal strain and growth medium; in the YES medium, the FB2 of virus-infected strains Tc37-1V and Tc37W increased by 67 and 16%, respectively, at 26 degrees C as compared to 20 degrees C.

In the present study, 53 native isolates of B. bassiana were screened for antifungal ability against Rhizoctonia solani, the causal agent of sheath blight of rice. Also, the mechanisms underlying such interaction and the responsible antimicrobial traits involved were studied.

The results showed that B. bassiana exhibited antagonistic behavior against R. solani with a percent mycelial inhibition recorded maximum of up to 71.15%. Mechanisms behind antagonism were the production of cell-wall-degrading enzymes, mycoparasitism, and the release of secondary metabolites. The study also deciphered several antimicrobial traits and the presence of virulent genes in B. bassiana as a determinant of potential plant disease antagonists. Under field conditions, combined application of the B. bassiana microbial consortium as a seed treatment, seedling root dip, and foliar sprays showed reduced sheath blight disease incidence and severity up to 69.26 and 60.50%, respectively, along with enhanced plant-growth-promoting attributes.

9970,Hygrocybe virginea is a systemic endophyte of Plantago lanceolata,"Species of Hygrocybe (waxcaps) are mostly colorful mushrooms, which are characteristic of undisturbed grasslands. These fungi are endangered in many places worldwide, but their biology remains a mystery: while isotopic signatures indicate that waxcaps are neither mycorrhizal nor saprotrophic, they were recently observed in plant roots and molecularly detected in aboveground tissues. We aimed to establish a model system of Plantago lanceolata plants colonized by H. coccinea for future detailed studies of the plant-fungus association, and species-specific primers were designed to control infection success and screen environmental samples for waxcaps. The experimentally treated plants grown from surface-sterilized seeds were indeed colonized by waxcaps after 22 weeks of incubation. However, the fungal infection was independent from the experimental treatment and apparently resulted from infected seeds. Screening of field material confirmed that at least one species, i.e., H. virginea, is a maternally transmitted endophytic fungus associated with P. lanceolata. In the experiments, it obviously expanded to the roots during or after seed germination. The endophytic growth is also consistent with the carbon isotopic signature of Hygrocybe, which deviates less from the host plants' signature than known from ectomycorrhizal associations. However, waxcaps obviously acquire nitrogen (N) from a source outside the plant, like mycorrhizal fungi do. The extensive root system of P. lanceolata is hypothesized to facilitate reaching of nitrogen sources for Hygrocybe which are enriched in the heavier (15) N isotope.","Tello, SA; Silva-Flores, P; Agerer, R; Halbwachs, H; Beck, A; Persoh, D",MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS,2014,10.1007/s11557-013-0928-0,0.883012696490324,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990767624462861,0.009232375537139,0.999991844396727,8.15560327294129e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Prevalence varied substantially from year to year and from tissue to tissue, but some host species routinely had high prevalence. The same genotype was found to occur throughout a host, representing mycelia' spread. Botrytis cinerea and Botrytis pseudocinerea are the species that most commonly occur as cryptic infections, but phylogenetically distant isolates of Botrytis were also detected, one of which does not correspond to previously described species. Sporulation and visible damage occurred only when infected tissues were stressed, or became mature or senescent. There was no evidence of cryptic infection having a deleterious effect on growth of the host, and prevalence was probably greater in plants grown in high light conditions. Isolates from cryptic infections were often capable of causing disease (to varying extents) when spore suspensions were inoculated onto their own host as well as on distinct host species, arguing against co-adaptation between cryptic isolates and their hosts. These data collectively suggest that several Botrytis species, including the most notorious pathogenic species, exist frequently in cryptic form to an extent that has thus far largely been neglected, and do not need to cause disease on healthy hosts in order to complete their life-cycles.","Shaw, MW; Emmanuel, CJ; Emilda, D; Terhem, RB; Shafia, A; Tsamaidi, D; Emblow, M; van Kan, JAL",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2016,10.3389/fpls.2016.00625,0.944639175675542,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.691565777686308,0.308434222313692,0.999998830767522,1.16923247805989e-6,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
5323,"The Genus Aureobasidium From Sooty Mould Communities in Poland, Including A. epipinicola sp. nov. and A. insectorum, New to Europe","The genus Aureobasidium contains numerous species inhabiting diverse habitats, including plants, where they live as saprobes, epiphytes, endophytes or pathogens. Sooty moulds are epiphytes forming multispecies communities on the surface of leaves or needles covered with exudates of some insects. On leaves and needles, they form black coatings and therefore have a negative impact on plants due to the reduction of photosynthesis and foliar gas exchange. Additionally, they decrease the visual aesthetic qualities of ornamental plants in urban environments. In temperate climates, sooty moulds were previously commonly assigned to the species Fumago vagans, which was proven to belong to two different species, Aureobasidium pullulans and Cladosporium herbarum. A. pullulans was indeed reported from sooty mould communities based on morphological features or using sequences of a single locus (ITS). In this study, 32 strains of Aureobasidium isolated from sooty mould communities covering leaves/needles of six ornamental woody plants from municipal greenery in Poland were subjected to multilocus (ITS, LSU, rpb2, tef1, tub2) phylogenetic analyses and morphological analyses in order to resolve their species assignment. Thirty strains were identified as A. pullulans but one strain belonged to an undescribed species A. epipinicola, and one strain was assigned to A. insectorum, a species recently described from China. This study confirms that A. pullulans is a constant inhabitant of sooty mould communities in temperate regions and reports that other Aureobasidium species may also be involved in this disease complex.","Czachura, P; Piatek, M",PLANT PATHOLOGY,2025,10.1111/ppa.14109,0.955918919191754,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999992748815598,7.2511844023336e-6,0.999999999999255,7.449596495234799e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15374,Diversity of endophytic fungi in Taxus wallichiana var. mairei and effects of endophytic fungi on contents of taxol and intermediates,"Endophytic fungi in root, branch, and leaf of Taxus wallichiana var. mairei (Lemee et H. Lev.) L. K. Fu et N. Li were isolated by using five types of isolation media, and molecular identification was conducted for the isolated strains; differences in contents of taxol and intermediates baccatin III and 10-deacetylbaccatin III (10-DAB) in leaf of T. wallichiana var. mairei in different endophytic fungus treatment groups were analyzed by HPLC technology. The results show that 69 strains of endophytic fungi are isolated from root, branch, and leaf of T. wallichiana var. mairei in total, belonging to 36 species of 26 genera; there are 15 strains of endophytic fungi in Muyocopron Speg., accounting for 21.7% of the total strain number of isolated endophytic fungi, so it is the dominant genus of endophytic fungi in T. wallichiana var. mairei. Taxol, baccatin III, and 10-DAB can be simultaneously detected in leaf of T. wallichiana var. mairei in 19 endophytic fungus treatment groups, and contents of baccatin III and 10-DAB in these treatment groups are lower than those in the control group (not spraying endophytic fungal elicitor solution), but there is an evident difference in taxol content. In which, taxol content in ten endophytic fungus treatment groups is higher than that in the control group, taxol content in Pseudodidymocyrtis lobariellae Flakus, Rodr. Flakus et Etayo treatment group is the highest (0.228 mg • g-1), and those in Gymnopilus luteofolius (Peck) Singer and Coniochaeta hoffmannii (J. F. H. Beyma) Z. U. Khan, Gené et Guarro treatment groups are also relatively high (which are 0.180 and 0.139 mg • g-1 respectively). The duplicate verification result shows that taxol content in leaf of T. wallichiana var. mairei in P. lobariellae treatment group increases significantly compared with the control group, while contents of baccatin III and 10-DAB decrease evidently. It is suggested that the diversity of endophytic fungi in T. wallichiana var. mairei is relatively high, and some endophytic fungi can promote the biosynthesis of taxol in leaf of T. wallichiana var. mairei, in which, P. lobariellae, G. luteofolius, and C. hoffmannii can be used as candidate fungi for regulating the accumulation of taxol in T. wallichiana var. mairei. © 2022, Editorial Office, Journal of Plant Resources and Environment.

4452,Multiple species-specific controls of root-feeding nematodes in natural soils,"One of the major limitations to enhance sustainability of crop production systems is the inability to control root-feeding nematodes without using chemical biocides. In soils under wild vegetation, however, root-feeding nematodes affect plant performance and plant community composition varying from substantially to insignificantly. Previous studies in natural ecosystems have already shown that mutualistic symbionts, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and endophytes, may influence plant exposure to root-feeding nematodes. In order to learn more from natural systems, we examined nematode control in the root zone of a wild coastal foredune grass by microorganisms, other nematodes and microarthropods. We cultured all eight root-feeding nematode species that occur in the root zone of marram grass (Ammophila arenaria) in coastal foredunes of the Netherlands. Then, in an indoor growth experiment we exposed each nematode species to the potential natural antagonists collected from the same dune soil. Most of the eight dominant root-feeding nematode species could be controlled to some extent by more than one group of soil organisms added. The effectiveness of control varied among nematode species, which seemed to be controlled in a species-specific way. We conclude that in a natural soil the effectiveness of control by microorganisms, other nematodes or microarthropods varies among root-feeding nematode species. Most are controlled, at least to some extent, by soil microbes. However, some root-feeding nematode species are controlled only by microarthropods. Our results strongly suggest that sustainable agriculture will benefit from using a range of biological control mechanisms when controlling root-feeding nematodes, rather than relying on single control agents. Our suggestion also implies that conserving soil biodiversity is crucial in order to enhance the reliability of biological crop protection against soil-borne pests and diseases.

The dependence on foreign timber is colsed to 50%. Timber forests are of great significance to China's timber and ecological security forest carbon sequestration and green development. However, due to single tree species, simple stand structure, and low level of biodiversity biological disasters occur frequently in timber forests. Among them, fungal diseases are responsible for the major biological disasters on timber forests in China. This study focuses on the scientific aspects such as the pathogenic mechanisms and green control, and reviews the etiology, occurrence characteristics, pathogenic mechanisms, and biological control by endophytes on the main fungal diseases on timber species in China.

19886,Arbuscular mycorrhizas and dark septate endophytes colonization status in medicinal plant Lycium barbarum L. in arid Northwestern China,"Lycium barbarum L. is an oriental medicinal plant. The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungal associations of this plant species are completely unknown. In this study, the AM and DSE fungal colonization status in three L. barbarum cultivars in arid Northwestern China were investigated. The results showed that the three cultivars were simultaneously colonized by Paris-type AM and DSE fungal associations. The highest colonization by AM was found in L. barbarum Ningqi No.1. The significant ""month"" and ""cultivar"" indicates that the AM colonization changed among the months within the cultivar. Meanwhile, roots of the three cultivars were heavily colonized by DSE fungi. Melanized hyphae were frequently observed in the three cultivars. Microsclerotia of varied shapes were also found in the cortex cells of L. barbarum. Hyaline hyphae were most abundant in August but their occurrence decreased in December. Lipid contents were abundant in hyaline hyphae, and changed with month. Lipid may act as energy material reserves to sustain the survival of DSE-host symbioses under drought environmental conditions.","Zhang, HH; Tang, M; Chen, H; Wang, YJ; Ban, YH",AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY RESEARCH,2010,NA,0.904218326566958,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991901623547076,0.0080983764529241,0.999999999689773,3.10227399324958e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
773,Forest succession suppressed by an introduced plant-fungal symbiosis,"Microbial symbionts can affect plant nutrition, defensive chemistry, and biodiversity. Here we test the hypothesis that symbionts alter the speed and direction of plant succession in communities that are shifting from grasslands to forests. A widespread C-3 grass introduced to the United States, Lolium arundinaceum ( tall fescue), hosts a fungal endophyte that is toxic to herbivores. In replicated experimental grasslands, the presence of the endophyte in tall fescue reduced tree abundance and size, altered tree composition, and slowed plant species turnover. In addition, consumption of tree seedlings by voles ( Microtus spp.) was 65% higher in plots with the endophyte at the one grassland site where these data were collected. Despite its negligible contribution to community biomass, a microbial symbiont suppressed tree establishment, posing an important constraint on the natural transition from grasslands to forests.","Rudgers, JA; Holah, J; Orr, SP; Clay, K",ECOLOGY,2007,10.1890/0012-9658(2007)88[18:FSSBAI]2.0.CO;2,0.990119683223279,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995502746101661,0.00449725389833902,0.999994208687372,5.79131262767874e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
652,Many foliar endophytic fungi of Quercus gambelii are capable of psychrotolerant saprotrophic growth,"Many endophytic fungi have the potential to function as saprotrophs when living host tissues senesce and enter the litter pool. The consumption of plant litter by fungi obviously requires moisture but, in the arid, western USA, the native range of Quercus gambelii Nutt., most of the precipitation occurs during the coldest months of the year. Therefore, we hypothesized that the endophytic fungi of Q. gambelii have the potential to function as psychrotolerant saprotrophs, which we defined in this study as an organism capable of significant growth on leaf litter at 5 degrees C. We further hypothesized that a tradeoff exists between growth of endophytic fungi at 5 degrees C and at 17 degrees C such that fungal isolates are either cold- or warm-temperature specialists. Consistent with our first hypothesis, we found that 36 of our 40 isolates consumed leaf litter at 5 degrees C, but there was a surprisingly high degree of variability among isolates in this ability, even among isolates of a given species. Contrary to our second hypothesis, there was no tradeoff between saprotrophic growth at 5 degrees C and saprotrophic growth at 17 degrees C. Indeed, the isolates that grew poorly as saprotrophs at 5 degrees C were generally those that grew poorly as saprotrophs at 17 degrees C. By virtue of being endophytic, endophytic fungi have priority in litter over decomposer fungi that colonize plant tissues only after they enter the litter pool. Moreover, by virtue of being psychrotolerant, some endophytic fungi may function as saprotrophs during the cold months of the year when moisture is temporarily available. Therefore, we suggest that some endophytic fungi of Q. gambelii could play significant ecosystem roles in litter decomposition and nutrient cycling.","Weatherhead, E; Davis, EL; Koide, RT",PLOS ONE,2022,10.1371/journal.pone.0275845,0.97321809307322,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999422711645846,5.7728835415398e-4,0.999999938428859,6.15711410745234e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10494,Dark septate endophytes enhance the drought tolerance of Haloxylon ammodendron in sterilized and nonsterilized soil,"Dark septate endophytes (DSEs) are a type of endophytic fungus that commonly colonize plant root systems in extreme environments, and play a role in enhancing resistance to drought stress. To investigate the potential applications of DSEs in improving drought tolerance of desert plants, three DSE strains isolated from Haloxylon ammodendron for strong drought tolerance - Alternaria tellustris (AT), Cladosporium sp. (CL), and Paraphoma radicina (PR) - were screened through pure culture in vitro. Pot experiments of H. ammodendron were then conducted with different DSE, water, and soil treatments. In both sterilized and nonsterilized soil, DSEs showed growth-promoting and drought-resistant properties, with a stronger effect observed under sterilized soil treatment. The results showed that in sterilized soil, AT and CL increased root biomass, total biomass and root shoot ratio under high drought treatment, while PR effectively enhanced branch number and root biomass under normal water treatment. Physiologically, DSEs improved plant drought tolerance by increasing soluble sugar content and superoxide dismutase activity. Notably, DSE inoculation facilitated the uptake and utilization of soil nutrients such as available phosphorus, nitrate nitrogen, and free amino acids by plants in both sterilized and nonsterilized soil. Overall, our study highlights the potential of DSEs in improving drought resistance and promoting the growth of desert plants.","Ye, QN; Li, X; Long, JM; He, XL",PEDOBIOLOGIA,2024,10.1016/j.pedobi.2024.150971,0.979129502717465,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.976628399055722,0.0233716009442781,0.99998411903397,1.58809660297798e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The objective of this study was to identify microorganisms from selected plants that produce resveratrol and to optimize the conditions for resveratrol production. Endophytes from Merlot wine grapes (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Merlot), wild Vitis (Vitis quinquangularis Rehd.), and Japanese knotweed (Polygonum cuspidatum Siebold & Zucc.) were isolated, and their abilities to produce resveratrol were evaluated.

MG1 in potato dextrose medium, the synthesis of resveratrol began on the first day, increased to peak levels on day 7, and then decreased sharply thereafter. Cell growth increased during cultivation and reached a stable and high level of biomass after 5 days. The best fermentation conditions for resveratrol production in liquid cultures of Alternaria sp.

White, diffuse to dense, amphigenous mycelia bearing Oidium conidia appeared on shoots in April each year and remained active until the last plants matured in June. Invaded leaflets became necrotic and dropped prematurely, sometimes leaving a green petiole. However, mildew incidence was low in most plots, and symptomless plants occurred in all species. Conidia were ellipsoid-cylindrical and measured 15 to17 × 39 to 47 µm. A sexual state of the fungus was not observed. Morphological characteristics of the anamorph matched those of Erysiphe pisi (1). In growth chambers, conidia from medic plants caused severe mildew of garden pea (Pisum sativum L. 'Early Perfection'). Powdery mildew occurred in plots of Medicago ciliaris, M. constricta, M. coronata, M. disciformis, M. doliata, M. granadensis, M. intertexta, M. italica, M. lesinsii, M. littoralis, M. lupulina, M. minima, M. murex, M. noeana, M. orbicularis, M. rigidula, M. rotata, M. rugosa, M. scutellata, M. truncatula, and M. turbinata.

3403,A foliar endophyte increases the diversity of phosphorus-solubilizing rhizospheric fungi and mycorrhizal colonization in the wild grass Bromus auleticus,"Asexual Epichloe endophytes establish mutualistic symbioses with grasses, improve fitness of their hosts and modify the surrounding environment. To test the hypothesis that this symbiotic association increases the abundance and diversity of phosphate-solubilizing fungi (PSF), a pot experiment was conducted combining two endophytic statuses: Epichloe-infected (E+) and non-infected (E-) Bromus auleticus plants, and two soil types collected from agricultural (A) and non-agricultural (NA) fields. Soil fungi were isolated at the beginning of the experiment and 12 months after the introduction of B. auleticus, and tested for their inorganic P (Pi)-solubilizing capability. Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization in B. auleticus roots of E+ and E- plants was also analyzed. PSF abundance was affected by the endophytic status and by the type of soil; the highest value was detected in the E-NA treatment, followed by the E+A treatment. PSF diversity was higher in NA than in A soils and higher in soils treated with E+ than in those treated with E-. Arbuscular rnycorrhizal fungi colonization was higher in E+ plants. We hypothesize that the positive association between Epichloe endophytes and mycorrhizal fungi with an increase in the PSF diversity would generate an increase in the phosphorus (P) available to plants.

3399,Diversity and Spatiotemporal Dynamics of Fungal Communities in the Rhizosphere Soil of Cotton in the Arid Region of Northwest China,"This study aimed to investigate the fungal diversity and its temporal and spatial dynamics in the rhizosphere soil of healthy cotton by high-throughput sequencing. We studied species richness, composition, and distribution of cotton rhizosphere fungal community with respect to location (Alaer, Kuerle, Tumushuke, Hami, Shihezi, Wusu, and Jinghe) and plant growth period (seedling stage, bud stage, flowering stage, and boll-opening stage) using the methods of PCR-based high-throughput sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR. A total of 1,838,454 fungal nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region sequences (rRNA ITS) were obtained from all cotton plants sampled at different growth stages in the seven locations in Xinjiang. The most abundant fungal group in the cotton rhizosphere was the Ascomycota (78.72%), followed by the Zygomycota (9.56%) and Basidiomycota (2.77%). These sequences revealed an enormous number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in cotton (1802 unique OTUs), with 67-464 OTUs in a single cotton sample, at a 3% threshold and a sequencing depth of 30,000 sequences. We identified 33 classes and 389 genera from the resulting 1,800,714 sequences. Sordariomycetes was the most frequent class in all samples, followed by Leotiomycetes and Eurotiomycetes. There were some differences in OTUs among different growth stages, but the differences were not significant, with 382 OTUs (14.66%) being common to each of the stages. A marked difference in the diversity of fungi in the rhizosphere soil of cotton was evident among the different locations, with the highest number of OTUs being detected in Jinghe (1084 OTUs) and clusters of OTUs representative of northern and eastern Xinjiang being detected.

12820,"Acidomelania saccharicola sp. nov., a new species of dark septate endophytes in Helotiales, with potential of controlling Fusarium wilt of banana","Banana wilt-like disease, triggered by Fusarium oxysporum, poses a severe threat to banana cultivation as a persistent soilborne pathogen. A strategy to effectively control this disease has yet to be found. Dark septate endophytes (DSEs) fungi have emerged as promising biocontrol agents, not only offering protection against plant pathogens but also enhancing plant growth. Herein, we isolated a novel DSEs species, Acidomelania saccharicola LZ3, from sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) soil in Liuzhou, Guangxi Province, China. Its classification as a new species was confirmed through morphological characterization and DNA sequence analysis. A. saccharicola LZ3 promoted the growth of banana and inhibited the growth of F. oxysporum by 73.28% in a Petri dish assay, and reduced disease by 52.82% in pots. The average incidence rate of Banana-LZ3 symbionts transplanted into a field highly contaminated with F. oxysporum was 25.93% and the control effect was 53.27%. Inoculation of banana plants with A. saccharicola LZ3 significantly increased polyphenol oxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. This research lays the groundwork for future investigations into A. saccharicola and other DSEs, exploring their potential in sustainable plant disease management.","Nong, Q; Zhang, Y; Long, YY; Chen, YL; Qin, LP; Lin, SY; Zeng, FH; Xie, L",BIOLOGICAL CONTROL,2025,10.1016/j.biocontrol.2025.105781,0.96038369997391,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.683993627224692,0.316006372775308,0.999999999643782,3.5621816607545e-10,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

Though their origin and evolution is enigmatic, they are known to play an important role in plant growth and development. Here we explore the endophytic fungal diversity of a perennial creeping vine, Ipomea pes-caprae (family Convolulaceae), occurring naturally in the coastal sand dunes of peninsular India. Of the ten endophytes isolated from the plant, Fusarium oxysporum (MH511104) was found to grow even at 2 M NaCl in potato dextrose agar medium. The fungus was able to successfully colonize and impart salinity tolerance to salt-sensitive paddy variety, IR-64.

17148,"First Report of Powdery Mildew Caused by Erysiphe platani on Platanus × acerifolia in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.","Platanus × acerifolia (Aiton) Willd. (London planetree) is a tree commonly used as an ornamental and in the furniture industry. In the summer of 2013, powdery mildew was observed on shoots of P. × acerifolia plants in the cities of Pelotas and Canela (State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil). Voucher specimens (n = 2) were deposited in the Phytopathological Museum Manoel Alves Oliveira at Federal University of Pelotas. Dense white powdery masses of conidia and mycelium were observed on leaves (abaxial and adaxial surfaces), petioles, and young stems. Leaves with high disease severities (≥70%) were deformed with curved edges to the adaxial side, and they often died. Mycelia were superficial with lobed appressoria. Conidiophores were straight, sometimes curved at the base, unbranched, cylindrical, 98 to 236 μm long (137.3 ± 41.2 μm) and composed of a cylindrical foot cell 49 to 102 μm long (66.9 ± 19.5 μm) and 4.4 to 6.4 μm wide (5.3 ± 0.8 μm) followed by two to four cells. Conidia were produced singly or in short chains (two to three), without distinct fibrosin bodies, ellipsoid to ovoid and measuring 24 to 37 μm long (29.5 ± 3.2 μm) and 12 to 19 μm wide (15.2 ± 1.4 μm), often with a wrinkled appearance. Primary conidia had truncate bases and rounded apex while both base and apex were truncated in secondary conidia. Germ tubes were produced apically (pseudoidium type). Chasmothecia were not observed. Genomic DNA was used to amplify the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region using the ITS1 and ITS4 primers. The resulting sequence (602 bp) was deposited (Accession No. KF499270) in GenBank. BLASTn searches revealed similarity of 100 and 99% with Erysiphe platani from P. orientalis L. (Accession No. JQ365943.1) and P. occidentalis L. (Accession No. JX997805.1), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis placed our sequence in a clade (99% bootstrap support) which included only other E. plantani sequences. In short, morphological and molecular approaches allowed us to identify the infecting fungus as E. platani. For Koch's postulates, 10 detached leaves were inoculated (10 to 15 conidia cm2) on their adaxial surface using an eyelash brush. Non-inoculated leaves served as control. All leaves were kept inside trays with petiole immersed in humidified cotton and maintained at 25 ± 1°C. Symptoms identical to those of the original leaves were observed 6 to 8 days after inoculation, whereas the control leaves remained symptomless. Although E. platani has been previously reported on P. × acerifolia in the city of Poços de Calda, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil (1) and on P. occidentalis in Korea (2), to our knowledge, this is the first record of E. platani on P. × acerifolia in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

4500,"Fungi associated with healthy grapevine cuttings in nurseries, with special reference to pathogens involved in the decline of young vines","Little information is presently available on the disease aetiology and epidemiology of the fungi involved in the decline of young vines. To address this question, four rootstock-scion combinations, originating from three commercial nurseries in the Wellington area of the Western Cape Province of South Africa were investigated during the 1999/2000 season. The first isolations were made in September from callused cuttings prior to planting in nurseries. After planting, asymptomatic rooted cuttings were selected from nurseries after 3, 6 and 9 months. Isolations were made from the roots, rootstock, grafting union and scion. Isolations from callused cuttings prior to planting clearly demonstrated that primary pathogens associated with Petri disease, such as Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Phaeoacremonium spp. were already present in the apparently healthy rootstock propagation material as endophytes. However, Cylindrocarpon spp., which cause black foot disease, rarely occurred in propagation material at this time. Species of this genus were isolated at higher percentages later during the season. Less than 1% of the plants were infected with Cylindrocarpon spp. before planting in the nursery (October), whereas 50% or more of the plants were infected at the end of the season (June). These findings suggest that the low percentage survival of vine plants observed in recent years is partly due to infected propagation material, and to new infections established in nurseries.","Halleen, F; Crous, PW; Petrini, O",AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY,2003,10.1071/AP02062,0.905836192706994,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.909469591116347,0.0905304088836527,0.99998826009473,1.17399052701472e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11175,Diaporthe species associated with the maritime grass Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa,"Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa is a perennial grass growing in sea cliffs where plants are highly exposed to salinity and marine winds, and often grow in rock fissures where soil is absent. Diaporthe species are one of the most abundant components of the root microbiome of this grass and several Diaporthe isolates have been found to produce beneficial effects in their host and other plant species of agronomic importance. In this study, 22 strains of Diaporthe isolated as endophytes from roots of Festuca rubra subsp. pruinosa were characterized by molecular, morphological, and biochemical analyses. Sequences of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (ITS), translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1), beta-tubulin (TUB), histone-3 (HIS), and calmodulin (CAL) genes were analyzed to identify the isolates. A multi-locus phylogenetic analysis of the combined five gene regions led to the identification of two new species named Diaporthe atlantica and Diaporthe iberica. Diaporthe atlantica is the most abundant Diaporthe species in its host plant, and Diaporthe iberica was also isolated from Celtica gigantea, another grass species growing in semiarid inland habitats. An in vitro biochemical characterization showed that all cultures of D. atlantica produced indole-3-acetic acid and ammonium, and the strains of D. iberica produced indole 3-acetic acid, ammonium, siderophores, and cellulase. Diaporthe atlantica is closely related to D. sclerotioides, a pathogen of cucurbits, and caused a growth reduction when inoculated in cucumber, melon, and watermelon.","Toghueo, RMK; de Aldana, BV; Zabalgogeazcoa, I",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2023,10.3389/fmicb.2023.1105299,0.719784467656473,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.980402182486438,0.019597817513562,0.999999991949826,8.05017397187413e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
14968,"Diversity and biological activity of endophytic fungi isolated from Amomum villosum Lour, in different regions of Yunnan Province","The distribution and population differences of endophytic fungi in Amomum villosum Lour, from Xishuangbanna and Maguan in Yunnan were studied, as well as their antioxidant and antibacterial potentials, in order to provide resources for the acquisition of new naturally active metabolites. Here, we isolated and purified endophytic fungi using plant tissue surface sterilization and identified them through ITS sequence analysis. Meanwhile, the activities of fermented endophytes culture extracts against five strains ol bacteria were determined using filtering paper method, and antioxidant activity was evaluated by assessing the total reducing power, including scavenging aetivites based on DPPH radical and hydroxyl radical. As a result, a total of 77 strains of endophytic fungi were identified from A. villosum. distributed in Xishuangbanna and Maguan, including 39 stains isolated from Xishuangbanna A. villosum, and 38 stains isolated from Maguan A. villosum. The dominant genera in Xishuangbanna A. villosum. were Penicillium, Colletotrichum, Xylaria, Daldinia, and Diaporthe, while the dominant genera in Maguan A. villosum were Penicillium, Phanerochaete, Pyrenochaetopsis, Neopestalotiopsis, and Cladosporium. Additionally, the Shannon diversity index, Simpson diversity index, and evenness of endophytic fungi in Maguan A. villosum were higher than those in Xishuangbanna A. villosum, and the Jaccard similarity coefficient between them was 0. 222 2. Strains BSR 18, BSR 32, BSR 34, and MSR 15 showed higher antibacterial activity, while strains BSR 10 and BSR 18 had strong antioxidant activity. Our research preliminary discussed the diversity of endophytic fungi form Xaishuangbanna and Maguan, and furthermore screened the activty of endophytic fungi from A. villosum. There were significant differences and affluent diversity among endophytic fungi from A. villosum. distributed in Xishuangbanna and Maguan.

19561,Endophytic fungal communities and their biotechnological implications for agro-environmental sustainability.,"Endophytic fungal communities have attracted a great attention to chemists, ecologists, and microbiologists as a treasure trove of biological resource. Endophytic fungi play incredible roles in the ecosystem including abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, eco-adaptation, enhancing growth and development, and maintaining the health of their host. In recent times, endophytic fungi have drawn a special focus owing to their indispensable diversity, unique distribution, and unparalleled metabolic pathways. The endophytic fungal communities belong to three phyla, namely Mucoromycota, Basidiomycota, and Ascomycota with seven predominant classes Agaricomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, Mortierellomycotina, Mucoromycotina, Saccharomycetes, and Sordariomycetes. In a review of a huge number of research finding, it was found that endophytic fungal communities of genera Aspergillus, Chaetomium, Fusarium, Gaeumannomyces, Metarhizium, Microsphaeropsis, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Piriformospora, Talaromyces, Trichoderma, Verticillium, and Xylaria have been sorted out and well characterized for diverse biotechnological applications for future development. Furthermore, these communities are remarkable source of novel bioactive compounds with amazing biological activity for use in agriculture, food, and pharmaceutical industry. Endophytes are endowed with a broad range of structurally unique bioactive natural products, including alkaloids, benzopyranones, chinones, flavonoids, phenolic acids, and quinines. Subsequently, there is still an excellent opportunity to explore novel compounds from endophytic fungi among numerous plants inhabiting different niches. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing could be a tool to study interaction between plants and endophytic fungi which may provide further opportunities to reveal unknown functions of endophytic fungal communities.

Here, we conduct morphological and transcriptomic response of endophytic fungus (Aspergillus montevidensis ZYD4) in both the presence and absence of salt stress. Under salt stress, the colony morphology of the A. montevidensis ZYD4 changed drastically and exhibited decreased colony pigmentation. Extensive conidiophores development was observed under salt stress; conidiophores rarely developed in the absence of salt stress. Under salt stress, yellow cleistothecium formation was inhibited, while glycerol and compatible sugars continued to accumulate. Among differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs), 733 of them were up-regulated while 1,619 unigenes were down-regulated. We discovered that genes involved in the accumulation of glycerol, the storage of compatible sugars, organic acids, pigment production, and asexual sporulation were differentially regulated under salt stress. These results provide further understanding of the molecular basis of osmoadaptive mechanisms of halophilic endophytic fungi. © 2017 Liu, Ding, Narsing Rao, Zhang,Zhang, Liu, Liu, Xiao and Li.",Liu K.-H.; Ding X.-W.; Narsing Rao M.P.; Zhang B.; Zhang Y.-G.; Liu F.-H.; Liu B.-B.; Xiao M.; Li W.-J.,Frontiers in Microbiology,2017,10.3389/fmicb.2017.01789,0.995989612586999,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997968618435223,0.00203138156477741,0.999999313953134,6.86046865983059e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12300,Characterizing the Fungal Microbiome in Date (Phoenix dactylifera) Fruit Pulp and Peel from Early Development to Harvest,"Date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) is considered to be a highly important food crop in several African and Middle Eastern countries due to its nutritional value and health-promoting properties. Microbial contamination of dates has been of concern to consumers, but very few works have analyzed in detail the microbial load of the different parts of date fruit. In the present work, we characterized the fungal communities of date fruit using a metagenomic approach, analyzing the data for differences between microbial populations residing in the pulp and peel of ""Medjool"" dates at the different stages of fruit development. The results revealed that Penicillium, Cladosporium, Aspergillus, and Alternaria were the most abundant genera in both parts of the fruit, however, the distribution of taxa among the time points and tissue types (peel vs. pulp) was very diverse. Penicillium was more abundant in the pulp at the green developmental stage (Kimri), while Aspergillus was more frequent in the peel at the brown developmental stage (Tamer). The highest abundance of Alternaria was detected at the earliest sampled stage of fruit development (Hababauk stage). Cladosporium had a high level of abundance in peel tissues at the Hababauk and yellow (Khalal) stages. Regarding the yeast community, the abundance of Candida remained stable up until the Khalal stage, but exhibited a dramatic increase in abundance at the Tamer stage in peel tissues, while the level of Metschnikowia, a genus containing several species with postharvest biocontrol activity, exhibited no significant differences between the two tissue types or stages of fruit development. This work constitutes a comprehensive metagenomic analysis of the fungal microbiome of date fruits, and has identified changes in the composition of the fungal microbiome in peel and pulp tissues at the different stages of fruit development. Notably, this study has also characterized the endophytic fungal microbiome present in pulp tissues of dates.","Piombo, E; Abdelfattah, A; Danino, Y; Salim, S; Feygenberg, O; Spadaro, D; Wisniewski, M; Droby, S",MICROORGANISMS,2020,10.3390/microorganisms8050641,0.978506095064482,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.989060325630692,0.0109396743693077,0.999999681769922,3.18230077622772e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

4199,Genome-Wide Analysis of Corynespora cassiicola Leaf Fall Disease Putative Effectors,"Corynespora cassiicola is an Ascomycetes fungus with a broad host range and diverse life styles. Mostly known as a necrotrophic plant pathogen, it has also been associated with rare cases of human infection. In the rubber tree, this fungus causes the Corynespora leaf fall (CLF) disease, which increasingly affects natural rubber production in Asia and Africa. It has also been found as an endophyte in South American rubber plantations where no CLF outbreak has yet occurred. The C. cassiicola species is genetically highly diverse, but no clear relationship has been evidenced between phylogenetic lineage and pathogenicity. Cassiicolin, a small glycosylated secreted protein effector, is thought to be involved in the necrotrophic interaction with the rubber tree but some virulent C. cassiicola isolates do not have a cassiicolin gene. This study set out to identify other putative effectors involved in CLF. The genome of a highly virulent C. cassiicola isolate from the rubber tree (CCP) was sequenced and assembled. In silico prediction revealed 2870 putative effectors, comprising CAZymes, lipases, peptidases, secreted proteins and enzymes associated with secondary metabolism. Comparison with the genomes of 44 other fungal species, focusing on effector content, revealed a striking proximity with phylogenetically unrelated species (Colletotrichum acutatum, Colletotrichum gloesporioides, Fusarium oxysporum, nectria hematococca, and Botrosphaeria dothidea) sharing life style plasticity and broad host range. Candidate effectors involved in the compatible interaction with the rubber tree were identified by transcriptomic analysis. Differentially expressed genes included 92 putative effectors, among which cassiicolin and two other secreted singleton proteins. Finally, the genomes of 35 C. cassiicola isolates representing the genetic diversity of the species were sequenced and assembled, and putative effectors identified. At the intraspecific level, effector-based classification was found to be highly consistent with the phylogenomic trees.

An endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum) in tall fescue produces ergot alkaloids that enhance plant survival but produce toxicosis in animals. The objective of this study was to investigate the rumen microbiota from gestation and lactation in ewes grazing tall fescue pastures with high (HA) or moderate (MA) levels of endophyte infection, and their relationship with serum parameters. Data were collected at the beginning of the study (d1), the week before initiation of lambing (d51), and at the end of the trial (d115). The rumen microbiota was evaluated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Ewes grazing HA had greater serum non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) (P = 0.024) levels compared with ewes in MA pasture at d115. Both the number of observed OTUs and Shannon diversity index tended (P = 0.08, P = 0.06) to be greater for HA than for MA on d115. At the genus level, Prevotella relative abundance increased with time in both MA and HA (on d1, d51, and d115: 15.17, 25.59, and 24.78% in MA; 14.17, 18.10, and 19.41% in HA). Taxa unclassified at the genus level including (unclassified) Lachnospiraceae, Coriobacteriaceae, and Veillonellaceae exhibited higher abundances in HA at d51 (3.72, 2.07, and 11.22%) compared with MA (2.06, 1.28, and 7.42%). The predictor microbiota for HA and MA were identified by a random forest classification model. The HA predictors included bacteria associated with unclassified Coriobacteriaceae and Ruminococcaceae. Other OTUs classified as Prevotella and Clostridiales could be microbial predictors for MA. The OTUs classified as Prevotella and Lachnospiraceae were negatively correlated with serum concentration of prolactin. Negative correlations with NEFA were observed in the microbiota such as species affiliated to unclassified Clostridiales and Prevotella. OTUs classified as Bacteroidetes and Coriobacteriaceae exhibited a positive correlation with NEFA. Our study confirmed that the rumen microbiota populations were affected by high levels of toxins in endophyte-infected tall fescue and were associated with host hormone and energy metabolism. © Copyright © 2020 Chai, Alrashedi, Coffey, Burke, Feye, Ricke, Park, Edwards and Zhao.",Chai J.; Alrashedi S.; Coffey K.; Burke J.M.; Feye K.; Ricke S.C.; Park S.H.; Edwards J.L.; Zhao J.,Frontiers in Veterinary Science,2020,10.3389/fvets.2020.544707,0.965596516804936,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999675380892617,3.2461910738322e-4,0.999999999415368,5.84632231515059e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2965,Fungal entomopathogens as endophytes: can they promote plant growth?,"Two experimental replicates were conducted to test whether strains of Beauveria brongniartii (BIPESCO2 and 2843) and Metarhizium brunneum (BIPESCO5) can endophytically colonise Vicia faba plants and improve their growth by comparing them with an endophytic strain of B. bassiana (NATURALIS((R))). The plants were inoculated through foliar spray and the effect of inoculation on plant height, leaf pair number, fresh root and shoot weights was measured at 7 and 14 days post inoculation (dpi). Endophytic colonisation of different plant parts with the tested fungal strains were confirmed 7 and 14dpi through re-isolation of inoculated fungi onto selective media and subsequent Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) marker-based genetic identification. All tested strains were able to endophytically colonise leaves, stems, and even roots of inoculated plants 7 and 14dpi, but per cent colonisation varied significantly among strains and plant parts within each sampling date. Foliar inoculation of plants with the tested strains increased plant height, leaf pair number, fresh shoot and root weights; however the increase was not always consistent across sampling dates in both experimental replicates. This study provides the first evidence for the endophytic colonisation of plants with two strains of B. brongniartii, an important biocontrol agent of Melolontha melolontha and other scarab beetles in several European countries, and thus extends previous reports on the ability of entomopathogenic fungi to act as endophytes. It also presents possible explanations for the lack of consistency in the plant growth promotion obtained by the foliar inoculation of entomopathogenic fungi.","Jaber, LR; Enkerli, J",BIOCONTROL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,2017,10.1080/09583157.2016.1243227,0.815927086081583,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996801025724049,0.00319897427595136,0.99999761622442,2.38377558048342e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1984,"Priority colonization of Cinnamomum camphora litter by endophytes affects decomposition rate, fungal community and microbial activities under field conditions","Senesced plant material contains many endophytic microorganisms that colonized the plant while it was living. The role that these endophytes play during the subsequent colonization of litter by decomposers is unclear, as is their effects on decomposer activity. To improve our understanding of the effect of pioneer colonization by endophytes on litter decomposition, five dominant fungal endophytes were isolated from Cinnamomum camphora leaves and inoculated onto leaf litter prior to monitoring decomposition under field conditions. Inoculation with some endophytes resulted in altered levels of decomposer activity, increasing lignocellulolytic enzyme activities, respiration rates, and fungal biomass, and increased levels of decomposition over the course of 120 days. Inoculation with endophytes also altered the structure of the subsequent community of fungi. This work suggests that priority effects associated with endophytes present during litterfall can have substantial effects on decomposer activities and community dynamics, with potential effects on nutrient cycling in ecosystems.

4972,Characterization of bacterial endophytes from Myanmar medicinal plants for antimicrobial activity against human and plant pathogens,"This research aimed to investigate the antagonistic activity of the bacterial endophytes from Myanmar medicinal plants. Thirty-one bacterial isolates were isolated from Myanmar medicinal plants: Tinospora cortlifolia (Wild.) Miers., Catharanthus roseus G. Don., Tectona hamiltoniana Wall. and Boscia variabilis Collett & Hemsl. (Capparaceae). Dual culture and agar well diffusion methods were used for antimicrobial assay. One endophyte from Catharanthus roseus and two bacterial isolates from Boscia variabilis Collett & Hemsl. (Capparaceae) had not only the antibacterial activity towards the human pathogenic bacteria but also the antifungal activity against the plant pathogenic fungi. From 16S rRNA sequencing, one strain from Catharanthus roseus G. Don. was Bacillus amyloliquefaciens DSM7 and two antagonistic strains from Boscia variabilis Collett & Hemsel. (Capparaceae) were Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str. 168 and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens DSM7, respectively. The best medium for the maximum production of the bioactive compounds was Bacillus medium supplemented with the 4% of starch and 0.3% of peptone for B. amyloliquefaciens DSM7 and B. subtilis subsp. subtilis str 168 showed the maximum antimicrobial compounds production when it was incubated in the medium amended with 3% of starch and 2% of peptone. The optimum conditions for the the maximum production of the antimicrobial compound were the medium pI I of 6 at 35 degrees C after two days of incubation for B. amyloliquefaciens DSM 7 and B. subtitles subsp. subtilis str 168 secreted the maximum concentration of the bioactive compounds at pH 7.5 and 35 degrees C on second day incubation period.

14571,Comparison on antimicrobial activity of 40 endophytic fungi strains from Ginkgo biloba and preliminary analysis on ingredients with antimicrobial activity,"Objective: To compare the antimicrobial activity of 40 endophyte strains from Ginkgo biloba and analyze the ingredients with antimicrobial activity. Methods: Endophytic fungi inhabited in leaves, stems, and fruits of Ginkgo biloba were isolated. Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus were used as indicators to do the microbial inhibition experiment. Forty strains antimicrobial activity were investigated by using filter paper method and flat hole well diffusion method. Silica gel column chromatography, Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography, preparative HPLC, TLC, and HPLC-MS were used to isolate, purificate and identify the antimicrobial components from the broth of Penicillium oxalicum YXY009. Results: Eighteen strains produced sterile mycelia on PDA plates. Among the other strains, Penicillium spp. and Aspergillus spp. accounted for 17.5% and 15% of the total fungi. The strain with the highest antimicrobial activity was determined to be Penicillium oxalicum YXY009. The inhibiting zone diameters of the YXY009 strain reached (13.47 ± 0.46), (22.35 ± 1.32), and (23.60 ± 0.83) mm against Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Rhizopus, respectively. Conclusion: An active compound POM was isolated from the fermentation broth of the strain P. oxalicum YXY009 and identified as 5-hydroxy-2-[(2S,3R,4S,5S,6R)-3,4,5-trihydroxy-6-(hydroxymethyl) oxan-2-yl] oxybenzoate for the first time. © 2016, Editorial Office of Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs.

6437,Endophytic Fungus Drives Nodulation and N2 Fixation Attributable to Specific Root Exudates,"Endophytic fungi play important roles in the modification of ecosystem productivity; however, the underlying mechanisms are only partly understood. A 2-year field plot experiment verified that the endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris increased peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) yields and significantly increased nodulation and N-2 fixation regardless of whether N fertilizers were added. Root exudates collected from P. liquidambaris-colonized plants significantly improved nodulation and N-2 fixation. Rhizosphere stimulation experiments further showed that colonized root exudates had significantly decreased soil nitrate (NO3-) concentrations, with decreased abundance and diversity of ammonia oxidizing archaea (AOA). In contrast, the abundance and diversity of diazotrophs significantly increased, and most diazotrophs identified were peanut nodulation-related strains (Bradyrhizobium sp.). P. liquidambaris symbiosis increased the expression of phenolic and flavonoid synthesis-related genes, and the derived phenolics and flavonoids could effectively increase the chemotaxis, biofilm formation, and nodC gene expression (nodulationrelated biological processes) of the Bradyrhizobium strain. Metabolic pattern analysis showed that phenolics and flavonoids are more likely to accumulate to higher levels in the rhizosphere soil of peanuts colonized with P. liquidambaris. Finally, a synthetic root exudate experiment further confirmed the underlying mechanisms for the P. liquidambaris-induced improvement in nodulation and N-2 fixation, i.e., that the specific root exudates derived from P. liquidambaris colonization decrease nitrate concentration and increase the population and biological activities of peanut nodulation-related Bradyrhizobium species, which beneficially enhance peanut-Bradyrhizobium interactions. Therefore, this study is the first to provide new insight into a positive relationship between an exotic endophytic fungus, crop nodulation, and N-2 fixation increase. IMPORTANCE Endophytic fungi play an important role in balancing the ecosystem and boosting host growth; however, the underpinning mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we found that endophytic fungal colonization with P. liquidambaris significantly increased the productivity, nodulation, and N-2 fixation of peanuts through the secretion of specific root exudates. We provide a reasonable mechanism explaining how P. liquidambaris promotes peanut nodulation and N-2 fixation, whereby the specific root exudates produced by P. liquidambaris colonization decrease rhizosphere soil nitrate (NO3(-)) and increase the population and biological activities of peanut-nodulating-related Bradyrhizobium strains, which is beneficial to enhancing the peanut-Bradyrhizobium symbiotic interaction. Our study provides reliable empirical evidence to show the mechanism of how an exotic endophytic fungus drives an increase in nodulation and N-2 fixation, which will be helpful in erecting a resource-efficient and sustainable agricultural system.","Xie, XG; Zhang, FM; Yang, T; Chen, Y; Li, XG; Daia, CC",MBIO,2019,10.1128/mBio.00728-19,0.992953107176266,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.924016759337094,0.0759832406629055,0.999999985982102,1.40178977314775e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12993,Effect of endophytic fungi on expression amount of key enzyme genes in saponins biosynthesis and Eleutherococcus senticosus saponins content,"Objective: To analyze the effect of endophytic fungi on expression amount of key enzyme genes SS (squalene synthase gene), SE (squalene epoxidase gene) and bAS (β-amyrin synthase gene) in saponin biosynthesis and saponins content in Eleutherococcus senticosus. Method: Wound method was used for back meeting the endophytic fungi to E. senticosus. With GAPDH as internal control gene, the expression of key enzyme genes was detected by real time PCR method. E. senticosus saponins content was measured by spectrophotometry method. Result: When wound method back meeting P116-1a and P116-1b after 30 d, the expression content of SS improved significantly (P <0.05), however the back meeting of P109-4 and P312-1 didnt change the expression of SS. After that SS expression showed reduction-equality-reduction varying trend. Thirty days after back meeting P312-1, the expression content of SE improved significantly (P <0.05). Ninty days after back meeting P116-1b and P312-1, the expression content of SE improved significantly to 130%, 161%, respectively (P <0.05). After 120 d, back meeting four endophytic fungi, the expression of SE were significantly higher than the control (P <0.05). Back meeting four endophytic fungi form 60 d to 120 d, the expression of bAS was significantly higher than the control (P <0.05). The back meeting four endophytic fungi improved E. senticosus saponins content significantly (P <0.05). Conclusion: Endophytic fungi P116-1a, P116-1b, P109-4 and P312-1 significantly effected the expression of key enzyme genes SS, SE and bAS and then affected E. senticosus saponins content.

12268,Randomized trial of fluconazole versus low-dose amphotericin B in prophylaxis against fungal infections in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,"Over the past decade, invasive fungal infections have become an increasingly important problem in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The optimal approach for prophylactic antifungal therapy has yet to be determined. To resolve this issue, we performed a prospective randomized study to compare the efficacy of fluconazole (FL) versus low-dose amphotericin B (AmB) in preventing fungal infections during the first 100 days after HSCT. Patients undergoing allogenic or autologous HSCT were randomized to receive fluconazole 200 mg/day PO or amphotericin B 0.2 mg/kg/day IV beginning 1 day prior to commencement of conditioning regimen and continuing until engraftment, drug-associated toxicity was suspected, or systemic fungal infection was suspected or proven. High-dose amphotericin B (0.5-1.0 mg/kg/day) was started for patients with suspected or proven fungal infections. From January 1993 to December 1998, a total of 186 patients were enrolled into the trial, with 100 receiving FL and 86 receiving AmB. Eighty (43%) patients were removed from prophylaxis for persistent fever despite broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy or suspected fungal infections (FL 46 vs. AmB 34, P > 0.05). The incidence of proven fungal infections (FL 12% vs. AmB 12.8%), suspected fungal infections (FL 4% vs. AmB 2.3%), superficial fungal infections (FL 1% vs. AmB 4.6%) did not show any significant difference. The survival at 100 days post transplant was similar between the 2 groups (FL 78% vs. AmB 70%, P = 0.254). Death attributable to fungal infections was similar in both groups (6% vs. 7%, P > 0.05). We conclude that fluconazole is as effective as low-dose amphotericin B in prophylaxis against fungal infections in patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation.","Koh, LP; Kurup, A; Goh, YT; Fook-Chong, SMC; Tan, PHC",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY,2002,10.1002/ajh.10234,0.995927368244933,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98277101463362,0.0172289853663798,0.999999497384516,5.02615484232471e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12346,The ameliorative effect of N-acetylcysteine against penconazole induced neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders in rats,"Penconazole (PEN) is a widely used systemic fungicide to treat various fungal diseases in plants but it leaves residues in crops and food products causing serious environmental and health problems. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is a precursor of the antioxidant glutathione in the body and exerts prominent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. The present study aimed to explore the mechanistic way of NAC to ameliorate the PEN neurotoxicity in male rats. Twenty-eight male rats were randomly divided into four groups (n = 7) and given the treated material via oral gavage for 10 days as the following: Group I (distilled water), Group II (50 mg/kg body weight [bwt] PEN), Group III (200 mg/kg bwt NAC), and Group IV (NAC + PEN). After 10 days all rats were subjected to behavioral assessment and then euthanized to collect brain tissues to perform oxidative stress, molecular studies, and pathological examination. Our results revealed that PEN exhibits neurobehavioral toxicity manifested by alteration in the forced swim test, elevated plus maze test, and Y-maze test. There were marked elevations in malondialdehyde levels with reduction in total antioxidant capacity levels, upregulation of messenger RNA levels of bax, caspase 3, and caspase 9 genes with downregulation of bcl2 genes. In addition, brain sections showed marked histopathological alteration in the cerebrum and cerebellum with strong bax and inducible nitric oxide synthetase protein expression. On the contrary, cotreatment of rats with NAC had the ability to improve all the abovementioned neurotoxic parameters. The present study can conclude that NAC has a neuroprotective effect against PEN-induced neurotoxicity via its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic effect. We recommend using NAC as a preventive and therapeutic agent for a wide variety of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders.","Morgan, AM; Hassanen, EI; Ogaly, HA; Al Dulmani, SA; Al-Zahrani, FAM; Galal, MK; Kamel, S; Rashad, MM; Ibrahim, MA; Hussien, AM",JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMICAL AND MOLECULAR TOXICOLOGY,2021,10.1002/jbt.22884,0.972241446990963,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.890668975210807,0.109331024789193,0.999999832887022,1.67112977567108e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

This study characterized the fungal and bacterial communities in a 30-year-old 'Cabernet Sauvignon' vineyard in Catalonia, Spain. Six symptomatic vines expressing esca-foliar symptoms and six additional asymptomatic plants were surveyed. Non-necrotic and necrotic tissues were sampled from rootstocks, trunks and cordons of the selected vines. Fungal isolations and molecular techniques were used in combination to investigate the endophytic microflora and to characterize the fungal and bacterial diversity of the vines. Pathogenic fungi involved in GTDs were identified, and the associations were assessed between all the isolated fungal taxa and the health status of vines, host parts and tissue types. Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Diplodia seriata were found in non-necrotic tissues, whereas Fomitiporia mediterranea was mainly found in soft-rot tissues, and Neofusicoccum parvum and Eutypa cf. lata in hard necrotic tissues. Several Alternaria and Trichoderma species were isolated, mainly from non-necrotic tissues. The single strand conformation polymorphism fingerprinting method showed differences in bacterial and fungal communities between the different types of tissue in healthy and diseased vines. However, no differences were detected in these microbial communities between non-necrotic tissues from asymptomatic and symptomatic vines. Two frequently-isolated species of Paraconiothyrium were tested for pathogenicity, but their pathogenic roles on grapevines was unclear.","Elena, G; Bruez, E; Rey, P; Luque, J",PHYTOPATHOLOGIA MEDITERRANEA,2018,10.14601/Phytopathol_Mediterr-23337,0.730695903084955,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999992987207986,7.01279201364652e-6,0.999999948437994,5.15620063312738e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
836,"Occurrence of dark septate endophytes in Nothofagus seedlings from Patagonia, Argentina","Temperate forests of southern Argentina and Chile cover a wide latitudinal and altitudinal range on both sides of the Andes, with Nothofagus species being one of the main tree species. Most of the larger remnants are protected within the limits of national parks and forest reserves. However, some of these are invaded by exotic conifers such as Pseudotsuga menziesii. In order to better understand the mycorrhizal condition within the Nothofagus-P. menziesii interaction, transects were established at six study sites along the effective recruitment area. Three treatments were established: Nothofagus forest without P. menziesii invasion (Forest), Nothofagus-P. menziesii matrix (Interface) and P. menziesii plantation lacking Nothofagus specimens (Plantation). A 2 kg mixed soil sample was taken at each treatment site and kept in brand-new plastic bags. A soil bioassay with Nothofagus seedlings acting as baits was set to evaluate the mycorrhizal inoculum potential and soil-fungi composition at each sampling treatment. Forty percent of the evaluated seedlings were found to be colonised by dark septate endophytes (DSE) fungi. Ectomycorrhizal colonisation percentage was significantly higher in plants growing in Forest soils (mean = 57.77%) when compared with Interface (mean = 42.53%) and Plantation (mean = 44.65%). The high incidence of DSE in young roots of Nothofagus seedlings in this study supports the hypothesis that DSE might be pioneering colonisers of young tree seedlings in secondary successional environments. For future interventions in the forest, either with productive or protective intentions, it should be taken into account the incidence of these fungi, which may have an important positive role in Nothofagus forest post-invasion recovery.","Salomón, MES; Barroetaveña, C; Rajchenberg, M",SOUTHERN FORESTS-A JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE,2013,10.2989/10220119.2013.792632,0.802577023813019,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996578614482877,0.00342138551712286,0.999999998167383,1.8326167250393203e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

16132,Endophytic fungi isolated from Heliotropium indicum and their antagonism activity toward Fusarium solani and F. oxysporum,"Endophytic fungi have great potential as biological control agents due to their ability to produce various bioactive compounds that can inhibit the growth of plant pathogens. One genus of pathogens that is often a problem in agriculture is Fusarium, which causes wilt disease in various types of plants. This study aimed to identify endophytic fungi from the leaves and stems of Heliotropium indicum, analyzed the content of secondary metabolites in plant extracts and endophytic fungal isolates, and evaluated the antagonistic potential of endophytic fungal isolates against pathogenic fungi. This study consisted of observing the location of endophytic fungi in plant tissues, identification of endophytic fungi, detection of secondary metabolite in fluid culture of each endophytic fungi and H. indicum, and antagonism test. The histological observations showed that endophytic fungi are found in the leaf epidermal, sponge, and parenchyma tissue. There were ten endophytic fungi isolates found in leaves and stems, namely Nigrospora gorlenkoana, N. guilinensis, N. musae, N. oryzae, N. rubi, Nigrospora sp. 1, Nigrospora sp. 2, Nigrospora sp. 3, Nigrospora sp. 4, and Penicillium oxalicum. The 10 endophytic fungal isolates including leaf and stem extracts of H. indicum contained secondary metabolite compounds; however, the species Nigrospora sp. 2 had high potential metabolite compounds. These metabolite compounds were able to inhibit the mycelial growth of Fusarium oxysporum, indicating their potential as biocontrol agents. The antagonism test results showed that the ten fungi isolates have antagonism effect toward F. solani and F. oxysporum.

Treatments with dual inoculum (PSB plus mycorrhiza) significantly (P .ltoreq. 0.05) increased alfalfa growth. Bacteria-microbial fungi interactions resulted in a greater utilization of the rock phosphate added to the rooting medium. Although Bayovar rock phosphate per se can be considered an inert substrate because it did not stimulate plant growth, metabolites released by PSB were able to transform the rock into available forms which could be utilized by alfalfa plants.

18265,Endophytic biocatalysts with enoate reductase activity isolated from Mentha pulegium.,"The biotransformation of (4R)-(-)-carvone by Mentha pulegium (pennyroyal) leaves and its endophytic bacteria was performed in order to search for novel biocatalysts with enoate reductase activity. The obtained results clearly indicated that endophytes play an important role in the biotransformation of (4R)-(-)-carvone with pennyroyal plant tissues. The best activity was associated to the endophytic bacteria Pseudomonas proteolytica FM18Mci1 and Bacillus sp. FM18civ1. Enoate reductase activity for the reduction of (4R)-(-)-carvone and (4S)-(+)-carvone as model substrates was evaluated for each strain. Finally, both isolated strains were evaluated for the kinetic resolution of racemic carvone. The two bacteria gave (1R, 4R) or (1R, 4S)-dihydrocarvone as major products. P. proteolytica FM18Mci1 had preference for the 4S-(-)-carvone, reaching a conversion 95% in 24 h. In contrast, Bacillus sp. FM18civ1 had preference for (4R)-(-)-carvone.

10862,Induction of Tanshinone IIA Production in the Endophytic Fungus Emericella foeniculicola TR21 From Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge,"Background: Tanshinone IIA is effective in the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases. Currently, tanshinone IIA is primarily derived from the roots and rhizomes of Salviamiltiorrhiza Bunge. However, resources of S.miltiorrhiza are already facing scarcity. Objectives: The aim of this study was to obtain an alternative and high-yield mutagenic strain of tanshinone IIA, thus establishing a cost-effective and non-plant-derived substitute for tanshinone IIA. Methods: The mutants with enhanced tanshinone IIA production were selected through protoplast mutation induced byultraviolet radiation (UV) and sodium nitrite (NaNO2). The yield of tanshinone IIA (YT) was determined using a TU-1810ultraviolet-visible (UV/Vis) Spectrophotometer and LC-2010A high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The selectedmutant strains with the highest yield were subjected to continuous cultivation, and the dry weight of mycelium (DW) and theYT in the first generation were used as controls to assess passage stability. Fungal genomic DNA from the wild-type and mutantstrains was extracted from axenic cultures using the modified cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) method. Results: The colony morphological characteristics exhibited significant differences between the wild-type TR21 and the mutantNU204. The NU204 demonstrated a significantly higher tanshinone IIA yield at 165 +/- 2.52 mu g/g, which was 4.67-fold greater thanthat of TR21 (P < 0.01), indicating a substantial enhancement in NU204 production compared to TR21. The NU204 underwent continuous cultivation for five generations, and there were no significant differences in the DW and YT among the different generations (P > 0.05). The observed genetic changes between TR21 and NU204 were induced by the protoplast mutation. Conclusions: The mutant NU204 is emerging as a promising novel alternative source for tanshin one IIA, offering potential practical applications in production.","Ma, CX; Jiang, DL; Wei, XY",JUNDISHAPUR JOURNAL OF NATURAL PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS,2024,10.5812/jjnpp-148351,0.857157037790777,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.976986092026821,0.0230139079731795,0.999986899797041,1.31002029588601e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15133,Filtrates from cultures of endophytic fungi isolated from leaves of Copaifera oblongifolia (Fabaceae) affect germination and seedling development differently; [Fungos endofíticos isolados de folhas de Copaifera oblongifolia (Fabaceae) afetam diferentemente a germinação e o desenvolvimento das plântulas],"Interactions between endophytic fungi (EFs) and their host plants range from positive to neutral to negative. The results of such interactions can vary depending on the organ of the infected host plant. EFs isolated from the leaves of some species of plants have potential for use as agents to inhibit seed germination and control invasive plants. The objectives of this study were to identify EFs present in the leaves of Copaifera oblongifolia and to evaluate the role of these fungi in seed germination and seedling development. A total of 11 species of EFs were isolated, which were identified using the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) sequence of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. The isolated species of EFs are generalists and probably are transmitted horizontally. Laboratory tests revealed that filtrates of these fungal isolates differently affect seed germination and seedling development of C. oblongifolia. The species Curvularia intermedia, Neofusicoccum parvum, Pseudofusicoccum stromaticum and Phomopsis sp. negatively affected seed germination, with N. parvum standing out for its negative effects, inhibiting seedling germination and survival in 89 and 222%, respectively. In addition, Cochliobolus intermedius negatively affected seedling development. Thus, the combined use of N. parvum and C. intermedius, or products from the metabolism of these microorganisms, in the control of invasive plants deserves attention from future studies. © 2023, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

Some oogonia contain thin-walled spherules, which may represent (walled) oospheres or spores of an endoparasitic fungus (?chytrid), whereas single, large spheres in the interior are interpreted as oospores. Antheridia adpressed to several of the specimens are clavate and paragynous. This discovery sheds light on the morphology and biology of peronosporomycetes in a terrestrial ecosystem some 330 My ago. Although the organism occurs exclusively in the periderm of L. rhodumnense, it is not known whether it represents a symptomless endophyte, pathogen, or saprotroph.

Endophyte assemblages were analysed in 12 poplar plantations (clone 1-214), chosen according to a factorial scheme with two factors: age and site quality. Crown condition, dendrometric variables and foliar nutrients were recorded in each sampled tree to evaluate their effects on endophytic communities. Fungal species richness and relative isolation frequency (RIF) were higher in young stands than in adult stands. Moreover, the age-related differences depended on site quality, with the lowest richness levels observed in adult stands located in poor sites. At stand level, endophyte assemblages varied among stands according to site quality and, to a lesser extent, stand age. On the other hand, crown discoloration, total height and foliar concentrations of iron and zinc may be key indicators of endophytic communities in poplar plantations, at tree level.","Martín-García, J; Espiga, E; Pando, V; Diez, JJ",SILVA FENNICA,2011,10.14214/sf.40,0.992509222241566,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999841803973321,1.581960266791e-4,0.999999800837557,1.99162442648948e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
17072,An ecological role of fungal endophytes to ameliorate plants under biotic stress.,"It is our consensus that plants survive and flourish in stressed ecosystems because of endosymbiotic organisms that have co-evolved and were essential for their adaptation to changing environments. Some of these microbial components are noncultivable and vertically transmitted from generation to generation. They represent a vast reservoir of heritable DNA that can enhance plant performance in changing environments and add genetic flexibility to adaptation of long-lived plants. If such endophytes can be identified that not only persist in progeny of novel hosts, but can confer benefits in mechanized, agricultural systems, they would be increasingly important in agricultural production and lead to a rapid and economical method of providing novel germplasms of native and crop plants. In the present review, authors advocate the deployment of fungal diversity and its role to overcome the biotic stress in plants.

11641,A high-throughput RNA-Seq approach to elucidate the transcriptional response of Piriformospora indica to high salt stress,"Piriformospora indica, a root endophytic fungus, augments plant nutrition and productivity as well as protects plants against pathogens and abiotic stresses. High salinity is a major problem faced by plants as well as by microbes. Until now, the precise mechanism of salt stress tolerance in P. indica has remained elusive. In this study, the transcriptomes of control and salt-treated (0.5 M NaCl) P. indica were sequenced via the RNA-seq approach. A total of 30,567 transcripts and 15,410 unigenes for P. indica were obtained from 7.3 Gb clean reads. Overall 661 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between control and treated samples were retrieved. Gene ontology (GO) and EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups (KOG) enrichments revealed that DEGs were specifically involved in metabolic and molecular processes, such as ""response to salt stress"", ""oxidoreductase activity"", ""ADP binding"", ""translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis"", ""cytoskeleton"", and others. The unigenes involved in ""cell wall integrity"", ""sterol biosynthesis"", and ""oxidative stress"" such as Rho-type GTPase, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase, and thioredoxin peroxidase were up-regulated in P. indica subjected to salt stress. The salt-responsive DEGs have shown that they might have a potential role in salt stress regulation. Our study on the salt-responsive DEGs established a foundation for the elucidation of molecular mechanisms related to P. indica stress adaptation and a future reference for comparative functional genomics studies of biotechnologically important fungal species.","Nivedita; Rawoof, A; Ramchiary, N; Abdin, MZ",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2021,10.1038/s41598-021-82136-0,0.951368611639272,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999595601744673,4.0439825532685e-4,0.999999999996925,3.0754288005141498e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2666,Change in root-associated fungal communities affects soil enzymatic activities during Pinus massoniana forest development in subtropical China,"Root-associated fungal communities play a key role in plant productivity and soil processes in forest ecosystems. However, how diversity and composition of root-associated fungi change with forest development and their linkage with soil enzyme activities remain largely unknown. We characterized the root-associated fungal communities, plant and soil properties, and extracellular enzyme activities along a chronosequence spanning young (15 years old) to over-mature (63 years old) Pinus massoniana forest development stages. Our results showed that P. massoniana roots harbored diverse root-associated fungal communities and they varied with forest development. Near-mature (36 years old) forest stands had the lowest alpha-diversity but higher relative abundances of ericoid mycorrhizal and activities of enzymes involved in C, N and P acquisition. The relative abundances of ectomycorrhizal fungi and endophyte were higher in middle-age (24 years old) and mature stands (45 years old), whereas the relative abundance of ericoid mycorrhizal fungi was highest in the near-mature stand. Soil pH, soil C:P and N:P ratios were important factors shaping the diversity and composition of root-associated fungal communities. Structural equation modeling indicated that changes in the community composition, but not richness of root-associated fungi, had significant correlations with soil enzymatic C:N and N:P stoichiometry. In conclusion, this study suggests that different stand development stages exhibit distinct diversity and composition of root-associated fungal communities, which affecting soil functions in terms of enzymatic activity.","Dong, HY; Ge, JF; Sun, K; Wang, BZ; Xue, JM; Wakelin, SA; Wu, JS; Sheng, WX; Liang, CF; Xu, QF; Jiang, PK; Chen, JH; Qin, H",FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT,2021,10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118817,0.71087849055402,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998578009021413,0.00142199097858668,0.999999999953404,4.6596282388122693e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
19600,Wheat endophytes and their potential role in managing abiotic stress under changing climate.,"Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivation differs considerably in respect of soil type, temperature, pH, organic matter, moisture regime, etc. Among these, rising atmospheric temperature due to global warming is most important as it affects grain yield drastically. Studies have shown that for every 1°C rise in temperature above wheat's optimal growing temperature range of 20-25°C, there is a decrease in 2.8 days and 1.5 mg in the grain filling period and kernel weight, respectively, resulting in wheat yield reduction by 4-6 quintal per hectare. Growing demand for food and multidimensional issues of global warming may further push wheat crop to heat stress environments that can substantially affect heading duration, percent grain setting, maturity duration, grain growth rate and ultimately total grain yield. Considerable genetic variation exists in wheat gene pool with respect to various attributes associated with high temperature and stress tolerance; however, only about 15% of the genetic variability could be incorporated into cultivated wheat so far. Thus, alternative strategies have to be explored and implemented for sustainable, more productive and environment friendly agriculture. One of the feasible and environment friendly option is to look at micro-organisms that reside inside the plant without adversely affecting its growth, known as 'endophytes', and these colonize virtually all plant organs such as roots, stems, leaves, flowers and grains. The relationship between plant and endophytes is vital to the plant health, productivity and overall survival under abiotic stress conditions. Thus, it becomes imperative to enlist the endophytes (bacterial and fungal) isolated till date from wheat cultivars, their mechanism of ingression and establishment inside plant organs, genes involved in ingression, the survival advantages they confer to the plant under abiotic stress conditions and the potential benefits of their use in sustainable wheat cultivation.",Ahlawat OP; Yadav D; Kashyap PL; Khippal A; Singh G,Journal of applied microbiology,2022,10.1111/jam.15375,0.944273518071179,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998542997545148,0.00145700245485163,0.99982979595395,1.7020404604972e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6742,Host species identity in annual Brassicaceae has a limited effect on the assembly of root-endophytic fungal communities,"Background: Establishing the contribution of host plant genotype to the assembly of root-associated microbial communities can be challenging, since multiple ecological factors may confound the effects purely due to the host, and plant species often do not occur sympatrically.Aims: We aimed to measure the relative importance of host plant species on driving the assembly of natural root-endophytic fungal communities, as compared to other habitat conditions that depend on the local environment.Methods: Species of annual wild Brassicaceae and the cultivated Brassica napus were collected in two separate locations, where they grew in close proximity. Arrhentherum elatius (Poaceae) was also collected in both sites and used as outgroup. The root-endophytic fungal communities of these plants were characterised using Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing and cultivation, and compared between locations and hosts.Results: Plant family and sampling location were the factors driving most variation in fungal communities, affecting both community composition and the proportion of cultivable fungi. Whether Brassicaceae were wild or domesticated had little effect on endophytic communities, although its contribution increased when cultivable fungi were considered. No strong specificity of endophytes towards hosts was found, because a core mycobiome was shared by different species.Conclusions: Plant species is a limited predictor of the structure and composition of fungal endophytic communities in roots of annual Brassicaceae, as compared to geographic location.

Ethyl acetate extracts from the endophytes and the leaves (methanol: dichloromethane (1 : 1)) were used for antibacterial activity against selected pathogenic bacterial strains by using the broth microdilution method. The anticancer activity against the U87MG glioblastoma and A549 lung carcinoma cells was determined by the MTS (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) assay. Bacterial endophytes that were successfully isolated from C. macowanii leaves include Raoultella ornithinolytica, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Pseudomonas sp., Pseudomonas palleroniana, Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus safensis, Enterobacter asburiae, Pseudomonas cichorii, and Arthrobacter pascens. Pseudomonas cichorii exhibited broad antibacterial activity against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria while Arthrobacter pascens displayed the least MIC of 0.0625 mg/mL. Bacillus safensis crude extracts were the only sample that showed notable cell reduction of 50% against A549 lung carcinoma cells at a concentration of 100 mu g/mL. Metabolite profiling of Bacillus safensis, Pseudomonas cichorii, and Arthrobacter pascens crude extracts revealed the presence of known antibacterial and/or anticancer agents such as lycorine (1), angustine (2), crinamidine (3), vasicinol (4), and powelline. It can be concluded that the crude bacterial endophyte extracts obtained from C. macowanii leaves can biosynthesize bioactive compounds and can be bioprospected for medical application into antibacterial and anticancer agents.","Sebola, TE; Uche-Okereafor, NC; Mekuto, L; Makatini, MM; Green, E; Mavumengwana, V",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY,2020,10.1155/2020/8839490,0.98377365900442,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999718549559573,2.814504404271e-4,0.999999999825514,1.7448620326376801e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

15176,Endophytic Streptomyces population induced by L-glutamic acid enhances plant resilience to abiotic stresses in tomato,"Endophyte bacteria, which colonize plants including roots, stem, flower, and fruit, it can derive their nutrients from the host, are recognized for their mutualistic relationship with the host plant. They play a critical role in promoting host growth and modulating abiotic stress. Carbon and nitrogen have a significant impact on bacterial population and secondary metabolite production, which are highly specific in various categories such as bacterial growth regulation, anti-compounds production. Application of L-glutamic acid can significantly enhance Streptomyces globisporus population buildup in plants. However, the effectiveness of this population buildup against abiotic stresses such as salinity and drought has not been investigated. Therefore, in this study, we tested the bacteria and their prebiotic activity against salinity and drought stress in tomato plants. Three different amino acids were treated on the tomato plants, and it was observed that L-asparagine and L-proline had a negative effect on plant growth and phenotype, while L-glutamic acid promoted plant growth and increased bacteria population density. The bacteria were found to colonize the rhizosphere and root endosphere, with colonization being promoted by L-glutamic acid. Additionally, Streptomyces was found to have plant growth promotion effects and provided protection against abiotic stresses. Interestingly, L-glutamic acid reduced the damage caused by salinity stress, but not drought stress. These findings suggest that L-glutamic acid plays a role in providing tolerance to salinity stress with the core microbiota, thus the current study demonstrated their prebiotic activity in the agriculture system.

12333,Eutypella parasitica and Other Frequently Isolated Fungi in Wood of Dead Branches of Young Sycamore Maple (Acer pseudoplatanus) in Slovenia,"Eutypella parasitica R.W. Davidson and R.C. Lorenz is the causative agent of Eutypella canker of maple, a destructive disease of maples in Europe and North America. The fungus E. parasitica infects the trunk through a branch stub or bark wound. Because the fungal community may have an impact on infection and colonization by E. parasitica, the composition of fungi colonizing wood of dead branches of sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) was investigated in five sampling sites in Slovenia. Forty samples from each sampling site were collected between the November 2017 and March 2018 period. Isolations were made from the wood in the outer part of dead branches and from discoloured wood in the trunk that originated from a dead branch. Pure cultures were divided into morphotypes, and one representative culture per morphotype was selected for further molecular identification. From a total of 2700 cultured subsamples, 1744 fungal cultures were obtained, which were grouped into 212 morphotypes. The investigated samples were colonized by a broad spectrum of fungi. The most frequently isolated species were Eutypamaura (Fr.) Sacc., Eutypa sp. Tul. and C. Tul., Fusarium avenaceum (Fr.) Sacc., Neocucurbitaria acerina Wanas., Camporesi, E.B.G. Jones and K.D. Hyde and E. parasitica. In this study, we distinguished species diversity and the fungal community. There were no significant differences in the diversity of fungal species between the five sampling sites, and branch thickness did not prove to be a statistically significant factor in fungal species diversity. Nevertheless, relatively low Jaccard similarity index values suggested possible differences in the fungal communities from different sampling sites. This was confirmed by an analysis of similarities, which showed that the isolated fungal community distinctly differed between the five sampling sites and between the different isolation sources. Eutypella parasitica was isolated from all five investigated sampling sites, although Eutypella cankers were observed in only three sampling sites, indicating the possibility of asymptomatic infection.","Brglez, A; Piskur, B; Ogris, N",FORESTS,2020,10.3390/f11040467,0.978359477895922,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998202037816427,0.00179796218357338,0.999999999658966,3.41033867812257e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2574,Effects of the infection by the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae in the growth and nutrient content of Festuca rubra,"Festuca rubra,a commercially important turfgrass, is a common species in natural semiarid grasslands of western Spain. In natural populations of this grass, about 70% of the individuals are infected by the fungal endophyte Epichlo. Jestucae. In most cases, infected plants are asymptomatic. To test if there were differences in growth or nutrient content between infected (E+) and uninfected (E-) plants, five half-sib lines of F rubra were used. Each line consisted of E+ and E- individuals. These plants were used for a 5 years long field experiment in conditions typical of the surrounding semiarid grasslands. The soil was poor in nutrients, and rainfall was scarce in the spring and summer. No differences in biomass production or number of stems were observed between E+ and E- plants. Regarding nutrient content, E+ plants in vegetative state contained more phosphorus than E- plants. This effect was consistently observed in the 3 years that this type of tissue was analyzed. In one of these 3 years Mn content was lower in E+ plants than in their E- counterparts. In plants in a reproductive stage, differences between E+ and E- plants were found with respect to Ca, Mg, and Cu content. In this developmental stage, the contents of neutral detergent fiber and lignin were lower in infected plants, and their organic matter digestibility was greater. The evidence presented in this study shows that in field conditions, the content of certain nutrients, P in particular, and fiber constituents of F. rubra are altered when the plants are infected by the endophyte E. festucae. Since most nutrients were found in concentrations below the adequate range for plant growth, increased P content is a beneficial effect of E. festucae infection. This fact helps to explain why endophyte infection incidence is high in natural populations of F. rubra, and why the development of endophyte infected turfgrass cultivars may be useful for low maintenance lawns.

18887,Unveiling the bacterial diversity and potential of the Avicennia marina ecosystem for enhancing plant resilience to saline conditions.,"Avicennia marina ecosystems are critical for coastal protection, water quality enhancement, and biodiversity support. These unique ecosystems thrive in extreme saline conditions and host a diverse microbiome that significantly contributes to plant resilience and growth. Global food security is increasingly threatened by crop yield losses due to abiotic stresses, including saline soils. Traditional plant breeding for salt tolerance is both costly and time-consuming. This study explores the potential of bacteria from A. marina to enhance plant growth under saline conditions, emphasizing their ecological significance. We analyzed the microbiome of A. marina from the Red Sea coast using high-throughput Illumina sequencing and culture-dependent methods across various compartments (bulk soil, rhizosphere, rhizoplane, roots, and leaves). Our findings revealed distinct compartment-specific microbial communities, with Proteobacteria being the dominant phylum. Functional predictions indicated diverse microbial roles in metal uptake and plant growth promotion (PGP). Remarkably, our culture-dependent methods allowed us to recover 56% of the bacterial diversity present in the microbiome, resulting in the isolation and characterization of 256 bacterial strains. These isolates were screened for PGP traits, including salt and heat tolerance, siderophore production, and pectinase activity. Out of the 77 bacterial isolates tested, 11 demonstrated a significant ability to enhance Arabidopsis growth under salt stress. Our study highlights the ecological significance of mangrove microbiomes and the potential of culture collections in offering innovative solutions for ecological restoration and crop production in saline conditions. The unique collection of mangrove bacteria, particularly from the rhizosphere and endophytes, showcases significant PGP traits and stress tolerance capabilities. These findings emphasize the importance of functional traits, such as salt tolerance, in the recruitment of endophytic bacteria by plants over taxonomic affiliation. The identified bacterial strains hold potential not only for developing biofertilizers to improve crop productivity but also for ecological restoration projects aimed at rehabilitating saline-degraded lands, thereby contributing to overall ecosystem health and sustainability.",Alghamdi AK; Parween S; Hirt H; Saad MM,Environmental microbiome,2024,10.1186/s40793-024-00642-w,0.97856369944238,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.981958990224481,0.0180410097755191,0.999999920400994,7.95990062751883e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6085,"Alternaria alternata and Neocosmospora sp. from the medicinal plant Euphorbia larica exhibit antagonistic activity against Fusarium sp., a plant pathogenic fungus","In this study, endophytic fungi were isolated from Euphorbia larica Boiss. and their antagonistic potential against phytopathogenic fungi viz. Fusarium sp., Rosellinia sanctae-cruciana and Cladosporium sp. was evaluated using an in vitro confrontation assay. A total of four endophytic fungi were isolated from the roots of E. larica. Among them, two fungal isolates (SQUCC-F1-1 and SQUCC-F6-2) showed inhibitory activity against Fusarium sp. None of the fungal endophytes restricted the growth of Rosellinia sanctae-cruciana and Cladosporium sp. On the basis of multi-gene phylogenetic analysis, these two endophytic fungi were identified as Neocosmospora sp. (SQUCC-F1-1) and Alternaria alternata (SQUCC-F6-2). Scanning electron microscopic observation of hyphae of the phytopathogenic fungi from the dual culture plate revealed morphological abnormalities such as loss of turgidity, shrinkage and disintegration of the hyphae. Analysis of the metabolites produced by these endophytic fungi by GC-MS revealed the existence of various fatty acids, fatty acid methyl esters, hydrocarbons and alkanes, which have been previously demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity.

3235,"Symbiotic seed germination of an endangered epiphytic slipper orchid, Paphiopedilum villosum (Lindl.) Stein. from Thailand","Paphiopedilum villosum (Lindl.) Stein is a native epiphytic slipper orchid in Thailand. This species is now being threatened and endangered. Propagation of this species is essential for conservation and reintroduction purposes. In this study, the propagation of P. villosum was achieved through the in vitro asymbiotic and symbiotic seed germination. Seeds of P. villosum sown on asymbiotic media, Murashige and Skoog (MS), Vacin and Went (VW) and Thomale GD (TH), did not germinate within 16 weeks. Seven different fungal strains were isolated from roots of this orchid species. The germination rate index (GRI) and the development rate index (DRI) of P. villosum seeds in treatments inoculated with fungal isolates PVCP01, PVCP05, and PVCP06 was significantly higher than uninoculated control treatments. Fungal isolate PVCP01 significantly increased the GRI and DRI of every stage of protocorm development, whereas fungal isolates PVCP05 and PVCP06 were only able to promote seed germination and protocorm development to stage 2. As for the wild orchid species, P. villosum, a compatible fungus is therefore required for promoting seed germination and protocorm development. Based on analysis of morphological characters and sequences of the nuclear ribosomal transcribed spacer (ITS), fungal isolates PVCP01, PVCP 05, and PVCP06 were identified as Tulasnella sp., Ceratobasidium sp., and Flavodon sp., respectively. The information obtained from this study will be used to propagate other threatened Thai orchids for conservation and reintroduction programs. (C) 2016 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

12613,Biostimulants Managed Fungal Phytopathogens and Enhanced Activity of Beneficial Microorganisms in Rhizosphere of Scorzonera (Scorzonera hispanica L.),"The principles of good agricultural and horticultural practice, considering both environmental protection and high yielding of plants, require modern cultivation methods. In modern agriculture, it is possible to use biostimulants that protect the soil against degradation and plants against phytopathogens and stress. The purpose of 3-year field and laboratory studies was to determine the effect of Trichoderma harzianum T-22 and other biostimulants on the health status of scorzonera (Scorzonera hispanica L.) plants and microorganism populations in the rhizosphere of this plant. For this purpose, Biosept Active (a.s.-grapefruit extract), Timorex Gold 24 EC (based on tea tree oil), Trianum P (spores of Trichoderma harzianum Rifai T-22) and Zaprawa Nasienna T 75 DS/WS fungicide (a.s.-tiuram) were applied for the pre-sowing seed dressing of scorzonera cv. ""Duplex"". The number of seedlings and the health status of scorzonera plants were determined during three growing seasons. In each year of the study, mycological analysis of seedling roots and roots after scorzonera harvest was conducted to establish the quantitative and qualitative composition of fungi colonizing these parts. Moreover, microbiological analyses of scorzonera rhzisphere soil were conducted and served as the basis to determine the total population of fungi and bacteria (including Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp.). Antagonistic activity of rhizosphere bacteria Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus sp. and fungi was determined based on laboratory tests on selected scorzonera soil-borne fungal pathogens (Alternaria scorzonerae, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium oxysporum, and Rhizoctonia solani). The experiments showed that Trianum P most effectively protected the roots of scorzonera against infection by Alternaria alternata, A. scorzonerae, Neocosmospora solani, Fusarium spp., Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Rhizoctonia solani, and Botrytis cinerea. The rhizosphere population of Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas sp. in the treatments with Trianum P or Zaprawa Nasienna T 75 DS/WS was larger than in the other experimental treatments. A reverse relationship was observed in the population of rhizosphere fungi. The application of grapefruit extract, tea tree oil and Trichoderma harzianum T-22 increased antagonistic activity of Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus sp. and selected saprotrophic fungi against soil-borne fungal pathogens, especially Alternaria sp., Rhizoctonia sp., and Fusarium sp.

Strain MP23T was slightly halophilic, and the optimal NaCl concentration and temperature for growth were 1 % and 30 °C, respectively. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities, strain MP23T was affiliated to the family Enterobacteriaceae and most closely related to Mangrovibacter yixingensis KCTC 42181T and Mangrovibacter plantisponsor DSM 19579T with 99.71 % similarity, followed by Salmonella enterica subsp. salamae DSM 9220T (97.22 %), Cronobacter condimenti LMG 26250T (97.14 %) and Salmonella enterica subsp. diarizonae DSM 14847T (97 %). Sequence analysis of 16S rRNA, hsp60, gyrB and rpoB genes showed that strain MP23T formed a phylogenetic cluster with M. yixingensis KCTC 42181T and M. plantisponsor DSM 19579T indicating that it belongs to the genus Mangrovibacter. The major cellular fatty acids were C16 : 0, C18 : 1ω6c and/or C18 : 1ω7c, C16 : 1ω6c and/or C16 : 1ω7c, C14 : 0, C14 : 0 3-OH and/or iso-C16 : 1 I and C17 : 0 cyclo. Polar lipids of strain MP23T consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. The DNA G+C content was 50.3 mol%. Based on experimental DNA-DNA hybridization values and average nucleotide identity derived from in silico comparison of whole-genome sequences, strain MP23T could be distinguished from its closest neighbours. We therefore conclude that strain MP23T represents a novel species of the genus Mangrovibacter for which the name Mangrovibacter phragmitis sp. nov. is proposed.

18074,Grapevine trunk diseases under thermal and water stresses.,"Heat and water stresses, individually or combined, affect both the plant (development, physiology, and production) and the pathogens (growth, morphology, dissemination, distribution, and virulence). The grapevine response to combined abiotic and biotic stresses is complex and cannot be inferred from the response to each single stress. Several factors might impact the response and the recovery of the grapevine, such as the intensity, duration, and timing of the stresses. In the heat/water stress-GTDs-grapevine interaction, the nature of the pathogens, and the host, i.e., the nature of the rootstock, the cultivar and the clone, has a great importance. This review highlights the lack of studies investigating the response to combined stresses, in particular molecular studies, and the misreading of the relationship between rootstock and scion in the relationship GTDs/abiotic stresses. Grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs) are one of the biggest threats to vineyard sustainability in the next 30 years. Although many treatments and practices are used to manage GTDs, there has been an increase in the prevalence of these diseases due to several factors such as vineyard intensification, aging vineyards, or nursery practices. The ban of efficient treatments, i.e., sodium arsenite, carbendazim, and benomyl, in the early 2000s may be partly responsible for the fast spread of these diseases. However, GTD-associated fungi can act as endophytes for several years on, or inside the vine until the appearance of the first symptoms. This prompted several researchers to hypothesise that abiotic conditions, especially thermal and water stresses, were involved in the initiation of GTD symptoms. Unfortunately, the frequency of these abiotic conditions occurring is likely to increase according to the recent consensus scenario of climate change, especially in wine-growing areas. In this article, following a review on the impact of combined thermal and water stresses on grapevine physiology, we will examine (1) how this combination of stresses might influence the lifestyle of GTD pathogens, (2) learnings from grapevine field experiments and modelling aiming at studying biotic and abiotic stresses, and (3) what mechanistic concepts can be used to explain how these stresses might affect the grapevine plant status.",Songy A; Fernandez O; Clément C; Larignon P; Fontaine F,Planta,2019,10.1007/s00425-019-03111-8,0.949588779274314,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Absence,0.192171612021098,0.807828387978902,0.999909094443869,9.09055561314487e-5,Absence,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Presence,Absence
7550,Foliar applications of mono-potassium phosphate fertilizer inhibit powdery mildew development in nectarine trees,"Foliar applications of 1% solution of mono-potassium phosphae (MKP = KH2PO4) fertilizer plus Triton X-100 (0.025%), sterol inhibiting (SI) fungicides, and lan alternating treatment of phosphate fertilizer and SI fungicides inhibited development of the powdery mildew fungus Sphaerotheca pannosa on fruits and leaves of nectarine trees in 3 consecutive years. The effectiveness of the alternating treatments with an appropriate systemic fungicide and 1% solution of MKP was similar to that of the commercial treatment with the systemic fungicides alone. However, application of the systemic fungicides only, omitting the phosphate treatment when they were scheduled, was significantly less effective than either the phosphate or the alternation treatments. These results indicate that the use of phosphate fertilizer has a significant role in disease control, enabling up to 50% reduction with number of fungicide treatments required for powdery mildew control. These results were confirmed in a large-scale demonstration trial conducted in a commercial orchard in 1995. This trial also revealed that a tank-mix treatment of 1% MKP solution with an SI fungicide provided the best protection against powdery mildew. Phosphate solutions were not phytotoxic to plants. Fruit harvested from MKP-treated trees by either alternation or tank-mix were similar or larger in their size distribution to those harvested from the commercial fungicide-based treatment. Fruit harvested from control, nontreated, trees were much smaller and produced ca. 23% nonmarketable fruits. The inhibitory effectiveness of MKP against powdery mildew in nectarine makes it a potential major component of all integrated pest management program.","Reuveni, M; Reuveni, R",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PHYTOPATHOLOGIE,1998,10.1080/07060669809500391,0.980771357356317,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995068649925585,0.00493135007441544,0.998491629622219,0.00150837037778073,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The present study was carried out to investigate the phytochemical analysis and antioxidant activity of endophytic fungi isolated from the ethnomedicinal plant Dillenia indica L. The ethyl acetate crude extracts of the endophytic fungal strains were preliminarily evaluated for their phytochemical analysis, and the results showed the presence of alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics, terpene, and saponins. The crude extracts of more than 60% of the isolates showed 50-90% antioxidant activity by DPPH and H2O2 assay. The inhibition percentage of ethyl acetate extracts ranges from 34.05 to 91.5%, whereas IC50 values vary from 72.2 to 691.14%. Among all the strains, Fomitopsis meliae crude extract showed a maximum inhibition percentage, i.e., 91.5%, with an IC50 value of 88.27 mu g/mL. Chaetomium globosum showed significant activity having an inhibition percentage of 89.88% and an IC50 value of 74.44 mu g/mL. The total phenolic and flavonoid content in the crude extract of Chaetomium globosum was 37.4 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g DW and 31.0 mg quercetin equivalent (GAE)/g DW.

19464,Fungal Endophytes to Combat Biotic and Abiotic Stresses for Climate-Smart and Sustainable Agriculture.,"The agricultural sustainability concept considers higher food production combating biotic and abiotic stresses, socio-economic well-being, and environmental conservation. On the contrary, global warming-led climatic changes have appalling consequences on agriculture, generating shifting rainfall patterns, high temperature, CO2, drought, etc., prompting abiotic stress conditions for plants. Such stresses abandon the plants to thrive, demoting food productivity and ultimately hampering food security. Though environmental issues are natural and cannot be regulated, plants can still be enabled to endure these abnormal abiotic conditions, reinforcing the stress resilience in an eco-friendly fashion by incorporating fungal endophytes. Endophytic fungi are a group of subtle, non-pathogenic microorganisms establishing a mutualistic association with diverse plant species. Their varied association with the host plant under dynamic environments boosts the endogenic tolerance mechanism of the host plant against various stresses via overall modulations of local and systemic mechanisms accompanied by higher antioxidants secretion, ample enough to scavenge Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) hence, coping over-expression of defensive redox regulatory system of host plant as an aversion to stressed condition. They are also reported to ameliorate plants toward biotic stress mitigation and elevate phytohormone levels forging them worthy enough to be used as biocontrol agents and as biofertilizers against various pathogens, promoting crop improvement and soil improvement, respectively.

Here we report the characterization of a secreted N-acetylglucosaminidase from the Neotyphodium sp. endophyte that infects the grass Poa ampla. The enzyme was expressed at low levels within the host, and activity could be detected in the apoplastic protein fraction. Low-level expression could also be detected in endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), Chewings fescue (Festuca rubra subsp. fallax), and tall fescue (L. arundinaceum). The enzyme may function in the recycling of chitin oligomers generated from turnover of the fungal cell wall.

5184,Simulated global warming affects endophytic bacterial and fungal communities of Antarctic pearlwort leaves and some bacterial isolates support plant growth at low temperatures,"Antarctica is one of the most stressful environments for plant life and the Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis) is adapted to the hostile conditions. Plant-associated microorganisms can contribute to plant survival in cold environments, but scarce information is available on the taxonomic structure and functional roles of C. quitensis-associated microbial communities. This study aimed at evaluating the possible impacts of climate warming on the taxonomic structure of C. quitensis endophytes and at investigating the contribution of culturable bacterial endophytes to plant growth at low temperatures. The culture-independent analysis revealed changes in the taxonomic structure of bacterial and fungal communities according to plant growth conditions, such as the collection site and the presence of open-top chambers (OTCs), which can simulate global warming. Plants grown inside OTCs showed lower microbial richness and higher relative abundances of biomarker bacterial genera (Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium, Aeromicrobium, Aureimonas, Hymenobacter, Novosphingobium, Pedobacter, Pseudomonas and Sphingomonas) and fungal genera (Alternaria, Cistella, and Vishniacozyma) compared to plants collected from open areas (OA), as a possible response to global warming simulated by OTCs. Culturable psychrotolerant bacteria of C. quitensis were able to endophytically colonize tomato seedlings and promote shoot growth at low temperatures, suggesting their potential contribution to plant tolerance to cold conditions.","Perazzolli, M; Vicelli, B; Antonielli, L; Longa, CMO; Bozza, E; Bertini, L; Caruso, C; Pertot, I",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2022,10.1038/s41598-022-23582-2,0.94206130534485,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993124500982775,0.00687549901722493,0.999999839225003,1.60774996871282e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6214,Fungal endophytes related to natural ripening and aromatic compounds in fruits of Vanilla species,"The biotic interaction between plants and endophytic fungi strengthens the adaptive capacity of the hosts against environmental disturbances and confers nutrition and protection benefits to the associated microorganisms. Studies associated with endophytic fungi report their presence in the majority diversity of existing plants. In hosts such as Cannabis, the interaction with endophytic fungi favors the production of secondary metabolites and phytohormones that participate in obtaining organoleptic properties such as flavors and aromas. However, the research carried out in the Vanilla genus is scarce making it difficult to understand the functions these microorganisms can perform for the benefit of the host. In relation to Vanilla, the fruits of species within the aromatic clade are distinguished by the presence of aromatic compounds, which increase their content during ripening. Some studies have shown that in this orchid fruit there are possibly endophytic fungi associated with the ripening process that is accelerated by curing, but few of these studies have evaluated the activity of these fungi related to the natural ripening of the fruit. In this review, scientific literature related to the knowledge of fungal endophyte communities and their possible contribution to the ripening and production of aromatic compounds in vanilla fruits is compiled. Research opportunities are identified to develop future studies on the role of fungal microorganisms to obtain metabolites and aromatic precursors from the fruits of Vanilla species, both in the wilds and commercial crops.","Mosquera-Espinosa, AT; Rodríguez-Mina, YG",TEMAS AGRARIOS,2022,10.21897/rta.v27i1.3133,0.817508793830037,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998601458642414,0.0013985413575856,0.999997301362711,2.69863728918907e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

In order to make these drugs readily available to the patients at affordable prices, we isolated the endophytic fungi from Catharanthus roseus plant and found a fungus AA-CRL-6 which produces vinblastine and vincristine in appreciable amounts. These drugs were purified by TLC and HPLC and characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, ESI-MS, MS/MS and H-1 NMR. One liter of culture filtrate yielded 76 mu g and 67 mu g of vinblastine and vincristine respectively.

10165,Fusarium root rot caused by Fusarium solani on sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) in South Korea,"Fusarium species are important post-harvest pathogens of sweet potato worldwide. A root rot disease was observed on sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) at storage houses in different locations in South Korea during 2016-2017. The disease was characterized by circular lesions with dark and light brown concentric rings along with cavities in the inner part of the root. Seven isolates were recovered from diseased samples. Two representative isolates were cultured on potato dextrose agar and the morphology was studied. Macroconidia were cylindrical and slightly curved with blunt and rounded apical cells. The size of the macroconidia was 28.3 (15.0-44.3) x 5.8 (4.2-8.3) m. The microconidia were fusiform to ovoid, variable in size and aseptate or rarely with single septa. Microconidial size varied from 9.2 (5.2-16.1) x 3.6 (2.6-4.5) m. The fungal isolates were identified as Fusarium solani (Martius) Appel & Wollenweber emend. Snyder & Hansen on the basis of the morphological and cultural characteristics. The isolates were confirmed as F. solani on the basis of molecular identification by rDNA-ITS and translation elongation factor (EF 1-) gene sequence analysis. The pathogenicity of the organism was confirmed by fulfilling Koch's postulates.

4570,Diversity of bacterial endophytes in 3 and 15 year-old grapevines of Vitis vinifera cv. Corvina and their potential for plant growth promotion and phytopathogen control,"This study represents the first investigation on ecology of endophytic bacteria isolated from 3 and 15 year old vine stems of Vitis vinifera cv. Corvina. The analysis was performed by means of culture-dependent techniques. The obtained results showed that new grapevine endophytic genera are being discovered. Moreover, Bacilli and Actinobacteria are frequently isolated from 3 year-old plants, whereas Alpha- and Gamma-Proteobacteria classes are more prevalent in the 15 year-old plants. Shannon-Wiener (H) index and analysis of rarefaction curves revealed greater genus richness in young grapevine plants. Furthermore, results evidenced an increase of genotypic group number within specific genera (e.g., Rhizobium and Pantoea). Among isolated strains from 3 and 15 year-old stems, respectively, 34 and 39% produce siderophores; 22 and 15% secrete ammonia; 22 and 21% produce indole-3-acetic acid; 8.7 and 41% solubilize phosphate. Besides, two strains isolated from 15 year-old grapevines showed 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase activity. Antifungal activity analysis evidenced that two Bacillus strains possess growth antagonistic effect toward all the tested fungal strains. Therefore, the present study extends our knowledge of the diversity of the endophytic bacteria by providing new insights into the complexity of the grapevine microbiome. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

17488,First Report of Bark Cracking of Koelreuteria bipinnata var integrifoliola Caused by Lasiodiplodia theobromae in China.,"Koelreuteria bipinnata var integrifoliola is becoming a popular urban green tree in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, China, because of its adaptation ability to local conditions, fast growth, and beautiful appearance. A survey conducted from 2007 to 2010 revealed serious bark cracking on greenbelt trees approximately 15 to 16 years old that had been transplanted 5 to 6 years ago. Bark cracks increased in size over time, extending into the phloem and leading to extensive areas of bark loss with discoloration of the underlying xylem. Symptomatic trees had fewer new shoots in spring; many wilted and died in summer. Root rot was not observed in the withered trees but large light brown lesions were observed on cross sections of the main stem, each with a dark brown outer margin. In a September 2009 survey, 95% of symptomatic trees had stem lesions more than 50 cm long. Pieces of xylem (2 × 2 × 1 mm thick) were obtained from the margin of lesions surface sterilized using 0.1% mercuric chloride for 30 s, washed in sterile distilled water, and placed on 2% potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 28°C for 2 days. The fungus was then isolated and 12 colonies were obtrained. Three isolates KL-1-2, KL-3-2, and KL-4-3 were incubated on 2% PDA at 28°C for 30 days to produce spores. On PDA, the colonies were circular or near circular with irregular gray edges turning black green or black. The fungus also produced abundant aerial hyphae that were villous, septate, and irregular branched. Conidia were elliptical (or rounded) and hyaline when immature, becoming dark brown and septate longitudinally when mature and ranged from 23.2 to 27.0 × 10.8 to 16.2 μm (average 25.3 × 13.6 μm), similar to Lasiodiplodia theobromae (Patouillard) Griffon =Botryodiplodia theobromae Pa.t, Botryosphaeria rhodina (Berkeley & Curtis) von Arx (2). DNA extraction directly from the mycelium of KL-1-2, KL-3-2, and KL-4-3 was performed after 10 days' growth on PDA (1). The identities of the three isolates were confirmed by ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 rDNA sequence (GenBank Accession Nos. JN681172, JQ894322, and JQ894323, respectively) analysis that showed 99%, 100%, and 100% sequence similarity to L. theobromae xsd08006 (Accession No. FJ478102), L. theobromae PD20 (Accession No. GU251120), and L. theobromae xsd08008 (Accession No. EU918707), respectively. Pathogenicity tests were performed on 20 five-year-old K. bipinnata var integrifoliola plants by placing mycelia plugs of isolate KL-1-2 (10 × 10 mm) on the main trunk after wounding with a metal needle. Control plants received PDA plugs without mycelium. After inoculation, humidity was maintained using wet absorbent cotton and PE wrap film. Stem bark and phloem cracking was observed after 60 days on 85% of inoculated plants; 30% of those trees also had xylem discoloration. Symptoms were similar to those with natural infection. Control plants remained symptomless. The same fungus was reisolated from the brown xylem of inoculated plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bark cracking of K. bipinnata var integrifoliola caused by L. theobromae in China. References: (1) M.-J. Côté et al. Plant Dis. 88:1219, 2004. (2) G.

16635,Use of fluorescent microspheres as a tool to investigate bacterial interactions with growing plants.,"Foodborne pathogens may exist as endophytes of growing plants. The internalization of Escherichia coli O157:H7 or other foodborne pathogens in growing lettuce plants may be independent of microbial factors. Mature lettuce plants were surface irrigated with E. coli O157:H7 or with FluoSpheres (fluorescent microspheres) and harvested 1, 3, and 5 days post-exposure. FluoSpheres were utilized as a bacterial surrogate. Microscopic examination of root, stem, and leaf tissue sections revealed that FluoSpheres were internalized into growing plants. Laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed that FluoSpheres were present within the root tissue and leaf stem tissue. The presence of FluoSpheres in internal portions of stem and leaf tissue suggests transport of the spheres from the root upward into the edible tissue. The level of uptake of FluoSpheres and E. coli O157:H7 was quantified using filtration. Numbers of FluoSpheres and E. coli O157:H7 cells in plant tissue were similar.

18149,Role of Epichloë Endophytes in Defense Responses of Cool-Season Grasses to Pathogens: A Review.,"Various cool-season grasses are infected by Epichloë endophyte, and this symbiotic relationship is always of benefit to the host grass due to an increased resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Fungal diseases adversely affect the yield, quality, and economic benefits of rangelands, which affects the production of animal husbandry. Therefore, it is imperative to breed resistant cultivars and to better understand the role of fungal endophytes in order to protect grasses against pathogens. The present review introduces research regarding how these endophytes affect the growth of pathogens in vitro and how they change the resistance of host plants to plant diseases. From the perspective of physical defense, changes in physiological indexes, and secretion of chemical compounds, we summarize the potential mechanisms by which endophytes are able to enhance the disease resistance of a host grass. Through these, we aim to establish a solid theoretical foundation for plant disease control and disease resistance breeding by application of fungal endophytes.

Both endophytes were effective in enhancing the growth of the test plant significantly (p<0.01). The increment in plant growth was measured in terms of length (shoot and root), diameter (shoot and root), total fresh weight and total dry weight of test plants in comparison with the control plants. Both endophytes served as significantly affective (p<0.01) wheat growth promoters. The present findings strongly support the utilization of these endophytic fungi as plant growth promoters.

There was significant increase in arbuscules, vesicles and hyphal percentages from first to third month in both the samples collected from two sites. In the third month, AM colonization significantly higher in both the sites. DSE colonization percentages do not differ significantly in first to third month.

16292,Modification and Structure–Activity Relationship Study of Cyclodepsipeptide Trichodestruxin D Derivatives as Potential Antitumor Agents,"Trichodestruxins A–D are cyclic peptides isolated from the plant endophyte fungus Trichoderma harzianum with inhibitory activities against the proliferation of tumor cells. This study aimed to modify the structure of trichodestruxin D (TD-(R)) to improve its antitumor activity and analyze the structure–activity relationship (SAR) to provide references for lead optimization. In this study, seven TD-(R) derivatives (TD-(S), TD-1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) were designed by different strategies, namely amino acid mutation, configuration switching, replacement of ester with amide, and N-methylation/demethylation. Those derivatives were prepared by a solid-phase peptide synthesis strategy, and structurally characterized by high-resolution mass spectra. The inhibitory activities of the peptides against the lung carcinoma A549 cells were assessed by determining cellular proliferation and migration using CCK-8 and a 24-well migration plate. Our data confirmed the inhibitory effect of those derivatives on A549 cell proliferation, among which TD-(S), TD-1, and TD-2 displayed higher inhibitory activity compared with the control (DMSO) group, but their inhibitory activity was slightly decreased than that of TD-(R). The inhibitory activity of TD-3, TD-4, and TD-6 on A549 cell migration was much better than that of TD-(R). SAR studies demonstrated a pivotal role in the configuration of the residue of 2-hydroxy-4-methyl-pentenoic acid and some residues in the structure of TD-(R). In conclusion, TD-3, TD-4, and TD-6 may be potential agents for the treatment of cancer migration, and our modification methods will provide a reference for the development of anticancer drugs in the future. © 2024.

This endophytoic fungus is naturally harboured in the fresh bark of the Cameroonian medicinal plant Duguetia staudtii (Engl. and Diels) Chatrou. The planar structures of the simplicilones were elucidated by MS and 1D as well as 2D NMR spectroscopic techniques. The relative configuration was assigned by NOESY experiments in conjunction with coupling constants; subsequently, the absolute configurations were assigned by the modified Mosher's method. The compounds showed weak cytotoxic effects against the cell line KB3.1 (in vitro cytotoxicity (IC50) = 25 mu g/mL for 1, 29 mu g/mL for 2), but were inactive against the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi.","Anoumedem, EGM; Mountessou, BYG; Kouam, SF; Narmani, A; Surup, F",ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL,2020,10.3390/antibiotics9110753,0.916763842838104,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999898074746651,1.0192525334861e-4,0.999999999782794,2.17205697872203e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
14147,"Role of bentonite on the mobility of antibiotic resistance genes, and microbial community in oxytetracycline and cadmium contaminated soil","The effects of bentonite (BT), a commonly used heavy metal deactivator, on the ARGs and microbial communities in soils and lettuce systems contaminated by heavy metals and antibiotics are unclear. A study was conducted to investigate the effect of BT on the mobility of antibiotic resistance genes in oxytetracycline and cadmium contaminated soil. Results showed that the addition of BT reduced the accumulation of OTC and ARGs in the soil and lettuce roots, but increased the abundance of ARGs in lettuce leaves, and increase the risk of human pathogenic bacteria (HPB) transferring to lettuce leaves. Redundancy analysis showed that environmental factors (OTC, H2O, SOM, and pH) were the dominant factors that influence the distribution of ARGs and intI1. Network analysis showed that Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the major host bacteria which caused changes in ARGs and intI1. There were significant positive correlations between ermX and ermQ, and a large number of HPB. The co-occurrence of intl1 with some ARGs (tetC, tetG, ermQ, sul1, and sul2), may threaten human health due to the dispersion of ARGs via horizontal gene transfer.

9621,The decreasing trend of the competitive advantage of endophyte-infected Achnatherum sibiricum over endophyte-free plants under high nitrogen conditions was reversed by pathogenic fungi inoculation,"Background and aims According to the nitrogen disease hypothesis, plant diseases will become more serious with the aggravation of global nitrogen (N) deposition. Numerous studies have indicated that Epichlo & euml; endophytes can enhance host plant resistance to pathogens. It is unclear how the competitive ability of endophyte-infected (EI) over endophytefree (EF) plants changes under the interference of N deposition and plant disease.Methods In this study, Achnatherum sibiricum, native to the Inner Mongolia steppe of China, was used as experimental material. We experimentally manipulated N addition and pathogen inoculation and examined the growth and competition between EI and EF A. sibiricum.Results The results showed that EI plants had a greater competitive advantage than EF plants under low N conditions, and this advantage decreased with the N supply. When high N and pathogens were both present, pathogen inoculation reversed the adverse effects of high N supply on the competitive advantage of EI A. sibiricum. Epichlo & euml; endophytes not only reduced the disease of EI plants but also reduced the disease of neighboring EF plants. Meanwhile, Epichlo & euml; endophytes changed the response of the host disease to N. The disease index of EF plants increased with increasing leaf N content, while that of EI plants did not change.Conclusion This study highlights that under the dual factors of N deposition and pathogen infection, endophytic fungi improve the competitive ability of host plants. Our results show that considering both biotic and abiotic factors is crucial for predicting the dominance of plant-fungal symbionts in the community.","Zhang, JZ; Yu, XH; Qu, YB; Shi, XJ; He, LY; Wei, XQ; Chen, L; Zhao, NX; Ren, AZ",PLANT AND SOIL,2023,10.1007/s11104-023-06239-5,0.755466592103392,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.983703984337127,0.0162960156628734,0.999999999713221,2.86778933933363e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
16011,Antagonistic Activity of Endophytic Fungi from Sophora alopecuroides against Botrytis cinerea of Wine Grape; [苦豆子内生真菌对酿酒葡萄灰霉病菌的抑制作用],"Sophora alopecuroides is an important sandy medicinal plant in Northwest China，with rich endophytic fungal resources and biological activity. In order to explore the application of biological control technology in controlling the Botrytis cinerea of wine grapes，B. cinerea was used as the target to isolate and screen 4 strains of endophytic fungi with antagonistic effects from S. alopecuroides. Through the plate standoff method，the mycelial growth rate method，the two-sealed-base-plates method，optical microscopy observation，and the vitro grape berry experiment to explore the antibacterial mechanism and control effect of 4 strains of endophytic fungi from S. alopecuroide against B. cinerea. The results showed that all 4 strains of endophytic fungi from S. alopecuroide had significant inhibitory effects on B. cinerea. It was determined that the inhibitory rate of strain HG21（Fusarium solani）on the hyphae of B. cinerea was as high as 85. 19%. When the concentration of the fermentation filtrate of strain HD31 （Fusarium oxysporum） was 25%，and the inhibition rate of mycelial growth of B. cinerea was the highest at 42. 46%. The volatile substances were produced after 6 days of pre-inoculation with strain BJ35（Alternaria alternata），and exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of B. cinerea with an inhibition rate of up to 88. 01%. As affected by the inhibition of 4 strains of endophytic fungi from S. alopecuroides，the mycelial morphology of B. cinerea showed significant changes，such as swelling，breakage，desiccation，and twisting. Lastly，the vitro grape berry results demonstrated that the preventive and protective effects of 4 strains of endophytic fungi from S. alopecuroides in vitro grape berry were generally higher than their therapeutic and bactericidal effects. Moreover，the biocontrol effect of strain BD41（Alternaria alternata）was significantly higher than that of Trichoderma harzianum and difenoconazole. The findings suggest that the 4 strains of endophytic fungi from S. alopecuroides can effectively inhibit B. cinerea，which has provided biocontrol materials and theoretical references for the B. cinerea of wine grapes. © 2025 Chinese Society of Nuclear Agricultural Sciences and Institute of Food Science and Technology, CAAS.

2741,Diversity of culturable phyllosphere bacteria on beech and oak:: the effects of lepidopterous larvae,"The community composition of epiphytic heterotrophic bacteria on leaves of beech and oak, which were either damaged by lepidopterous larvae or remained undamaged, was investigated. In addition, the ability of these bacteria to utilize inorganic nitrogen was studied. The bacteria were isolated on nutrient agar and systematically identified with biochemical and physiological tests. Rarefaction plots and the Shannon-Wiener function revealed that species diversity was significantly higher on leaves of damaged beech compared to undamaged leaves, but no differences were found on leaves of oak. The portion of bacterial isolates showing a strong response to ammonia and nitrate was significantly larger on leaves of oak than on those of beech. Furthermore, significantly more isolates with a high capability to assimilate both nitrogen compounds were found on leaves attacked by the folivorous larvae compared to those not attacked on oak. It is suggested that the changes in the microbial community in response to folivorous insects might affect the extent of nutrient cycling exceeding eventually the scale of a leaf.","Muller, T; Müller, M; Behrendt, U; Stadler, B",MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH,2003,10.1078/0944-5013-00207,0.558389055028552,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999787223562443,2.1277643755687e-4,0.999999999992242,7.75790542917321e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
10662,Creation of stable associations between perennial ryegrass or tall fescue and fungal endophytes,"The ability of 15 isolates of endophytic fungi isolated from ten species of grasses to form compatible associations following artificial infection with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne, cv. Vigor) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea, cv. Clarine) was examined. Twenty-two associations were obtained, only eight failed. The species Neotyphodium lolii, N. coenophialum, LpTG-2, Epichloe festucae, E. bromicola and Gliocladium-like endophyte, could be associated with both L. perenne and F. arundinacea. Acremonium sp. from L. persicum could be associated with L, perenne only. The observation of infected plants after 6 months and the study of mycelial transmission to the seeds showed the stability of the following associations: tall fescue with N. coenophialum and N. lolii, perennial ryegrass with N. lolii, LpTG-2, Epichloe festucae and Gliocladium-like. Acremonium sp. from Lolium persicum was not able to survive in L. perenne for a long time. Various aspects of partial incompatibility were observed among the associations: tall fescue/LpTG-2, tall fescue / Gliocladium-like and perennial ryegrass/N! coenophialum.

9843,Fungal endophytes enhance wheat heat and drought tolerance in terms of grain yield and second-generation seed viability,"AimsWe evaluated the impact of fungal endophyte symbiosis on the growth, ecophysiological and reproductive success of wheat exposed to heat and drought. Methods and ResultsThe resistance of pot-grown wheat to heat or drought stress was measured by quantifying efficiency of photosystem II (F-v/F-m), plant height, average seed weight (ASW), total seed weight (TSW), water-use efficiency (WUE) as well as time to 50% germination and percentage germination of second-generation seeds produced under heat stress, drought stress or well-watered conditions. The endophytic fungi tested increased wheat tolerance for drought and heat. Endophyte SMCD 2206 was the most beneficial, followed by SMCD 2210 and 2215. Surprisingly, second-generation seeds produced by drought-stressed wheat colonized by SMCD 2206, 2210 or 2215 had decreased WUE relative to those produced by endophyte-free, drought-stressed plants. However, these seeds germinated more rapidly than those produced by endophyte-free, stressed parental plants. ConclusionsThe tested consortium of endophytes has the potential to improve wheat adaptation to heat and drought. Significance and Impact of the StudyThe capacity of endophytes to increase wheat tolerance for abiotic stress and to improved germination in endophyte-free second-generation seeds arising from stressed plants could be applicable to agriculture. The mechanisms by which intergenerational endophyte-mediated affects occurs warrant further research.","Hubbard, M; Germida, JJ; Vujanovic, V",JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY,2014,10.1111/jam.12311,0.980686442158029,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.978647387287472,0.0213526127125284,0.999972165756341,2.78342436590417e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
9133,Mycorrhiza and seedling establishment in a subarctic meadow: Effects of fertilization and defoliation,"Question: How does changing resource availability induced by fertilization and defoliation affect seedling establishment and mycorrhizal symbiosis in a subarctic meadow? Location: 610 m a.s.l., Kilpisjarvi (69 degrees 03' N, 20 degrees 50' E) Finland. Methods: A short-term full-factorial experiment was established. with fertilization and defoliation of natural established vegetation as treatments. Seeds of two perennial herbs Solidago virgaurea and Gnaphalium norvegicum were sown in natural vegetation and their germination and growth followed. At the final harvest we measured the response in terms of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization, biomass and nitrogen concentration of the seedlings and the established vegetation. Results: Germination rate was negatively affected by defoliation in the unfertilized plots. The shoot biomass of S. virgaurea seedlings was reduced by the defoliation and fertilization treatments, but not affected by their interaction. In G. norvegicum, the germination rate and the seedling shoot biomass were negatively correlated with moss biomass in the plots. In the established plants the arbuscular colonization rate was low and defoliation and fertilization treatments either increased or did not affect the colonization by AM fungi. In the seedlings, the colonization rate by AM fungi was high, but it was not affected by treatments. Both seedlings and established plants were colonized by dark septate fungi. Conclusions: Reduction of plant biomass by herbivores can have different effects on seedling growth in areas of high and low soil nutrient availability. The weak response of AM colonization to defoliation and fertilization suggests that AM symbiosis is not affected by altering plant resource availability under the conditions employed in this study.","Pietikäinen, A; Kytöviita, MM; Vuoti, U",JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE,2005,10.1111/j.1654-1103.2005.tb02353.x,0.965309670331657,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.989079693233535,0.0109203067664652,0.999999995620053,4.3799468496530405e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
14937,Novel Endophytic Pseudescherichia sp. GSE25 Strain Significantly Controls Fusarium graminearum and Reduces Deoxynivalenol in Wheat,"Fusarium heading blight (FHB) is a devastating disease in wheat, primarily caused by field invasion of Fusarium graminearum. Due to the scarcity of resistant wheat varieties, the agricultural sector resorts to chemical fungicides to control FHB incidence. On the other hand, biocontrol represents a promising, eco-friendly approach aligned with sustainable and green agriculture concepts. In the present study, a bacterial endophyte, Pseudescherichia sp. (GSE25), was isolated from wheat seeds and identified through complete genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. In vitro testing of this endophytic strain demonstrated strong antifungal activity against F. graminearum PH-1 by inhibiting spore germination, suppressing germ tube growth, and causing cell membrane damage. Under field conditions, the strain GSE25 significantly reduced the FHB incidence and the associated deoxynivalenol mycotoxin accumulation by over 60% and 80%, respectively. These findings highlight the potential of the isolated bacterial endophyte Pseudescherichia sp. GSE25 strain as a biocontrol agent in protecting wheat from FHB-caused F. graminearum.

12569,Root Endophytism by Pochonia chlamydosporia Affects Defense-Gene Expression in Leaves of Monocot and Dicot Hosts under Multiple Biotic Interactions,"A study was carried out on the effect of the root endophytic fungus Pochonia chlamydosporia on plant systemic signal of defense related genes during fungal or nematode parasitism. Different biotic stress factors were examined, inoculating roots of dicot and monocot hosts with the endophyte, and measuring the expression of defense genes in leaves. A first greenhouse assay was carried out on expression of PAL, PIN II, PR1 and LOX D in leaves of tomato cv Tondino inoculated with Phytophthora infestans (CBS 120920), inoculating or not the roots of infected plants with P. chlamydosporia DSM 26985. In a second assay, plants of banana (Musa acuminata cv Grand Naine) were artificially infected with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense Tropical race 4 (TR4) and inoculated or not with DSM 26985. In a further experiment, banana plants were inoculated or not with P. chlamydosporia plus juveniles of the root knot nematode (RKN) Meloidogyne incognita. A similar assay was also carried out in vitro with adults and juveniles of the lesion nematode Pratylenchus goodeyi. Differential expression of the defense genes examined was observed for all plant-stress associations, indicative of early, upward systemic signals induced by the endophyte. Changes in expression profiles included a 5-fold down-regulation of PIN II at 2 dai in leaves of tomato plants treated with P. infestans and/or P. chlamydosporia, and the up-regulation of PAL by the endophyte alone, at 2 and 7 dai. In the TR4 assay, PR1 was significantly up-regulated at 7 dai in banana leaves, but only in the P. chlamydosporia treated plants. At 10 dai, PIN II expression was significantly higher in leaves of plants inoculated only with TR4. The banana-RKN assay showed a PR1 expression significantly higher than controls at 4 and 7 dai in plants inoculated with P. chlamydosporia alone, and a down-regulation at 4 dai in leaves of plants also inoculated with RKN, with a PR1 differential up-regulation at 10 dai. Pratylenchus goodeyi down-regulated PIN at 21 dai, with or without the endophyte, as well as PAL but only in presence of P. chlamydosporia. When inoculated alone, the endophyte up-regulated PR1 and LOX. The gene expression patterns observed in leaves suggest specific and time-dependent relationships linking host plants and P. chlamydosporia in presence of biotic stress factors, functional to a systemic, although complex, activation of defense genes.","Tolba, SRT; Rosso, LC; Pentimone, I; Colagiero, M; Moustafa, MMA; Elshawaf, IIS; Bubici, G; Prigigallo, MI; Ciancio, A",PLANTS-BASEL,2021,10.3390/plants10040718,0.83526104157781,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.91144621900588,0.0885537809941202,0.999975644554175,2.43554458253525e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

12220,Divergence in Responsiveness to Soil Biota and Mycorrhizal Partner Specificity between Montane Annual and Coastal Perennial Ecotypes of Yellow Monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus),"Premise of research. Species-level variation in interactions with root-associated microbial communities has its evolutionary origins within species, where dissection of the mechanistic basis of plant divergence is also tractable. We use montane annual and coastal perennial populations (ecotypes) of Mimulus guttatus (yellow monkeyflower) to ask whether and how plant-microbe-soil interactions have diverged between populations with distinct life histories. Methodology. We characterized fungal communities in representative montane annual (Iron Mountain) and dune perennial (Florence dunes) habitats in Oregon, where previous reciprocal transplants revealed local adaptation. We then investigated how plant ecotype, microbial source, and soil origin affected plant performance and root-associated fungal communities in a full-factorial greenhouse experiment using plants, soils, and nested inocula (sterilized, filtered to remove arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and whole) from the two sites. Pivotal results. In the field, coastal perennial and montane annual monkeyflowers harbored distinct fungal communities, and perennial roots were enriched for mutualistic taxa relative to local soils. In the greenhouse common garden, microbial effects were largely negative (particularly in the annual ecotype), and there was no evidence of plant local adaptation to belowground conditions. However, the coastal perennial ecotype was more colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi than the montane annual ecotype, and it preferentially recruited local arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi taxa even when inoculated from the montane source. Conclusions. Our results suggest that population divergence in life history and related traits shapes plant responsiveness to soil microbes and the specificity of their associations with root endophytic fungi, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Complex belowground effects on plant performance do not fit a simple pattern of local adaptation but may be by-products of other drivers of plant divergence. This work advances the study of heritable variation in plant-soil-microbe interactions in a model species for understanding the genomics of plant adaptation.","Mcintosh, M; Bullington, LS; Lekberg, Y; Fishman, L",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCES,2024,10.1086/730540,0.974471407406372,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.983482942846153,0.0165170571538468,0.999999887648814,1.12351185688198e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The study was undertaken to assess the gross seed-internal bacterial community in tomato and to confirm if spore-forming Firmicutes constituted major seed endophytes adopting cultivation versus molecular approach on surface-sterilized seeds. Testing the initial seed wash solutions of ""Arka Vikas"" and ""Arka Abha"" cultivars showed > 1000 bacterial cfu per dry seed, largely Bacillus spp. Tissue homogenates from surface-disinfected seeds did not show any cultivable bacteria on enriched media for 1-2 weeks, while 16S rRNA V3-V4 taxonomic profiling revealed a huge bacterial diversity (10-16 phyla per cultivar). Proteobacteria formed the dominant phylum (65.7-69.6% OTUs) followed by Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and a notable share of Euryarchaeota (1.1-3.1%). Five more phyla appeared common to both cultivars in minor shares (Acidobacteria, Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi, Spirochaetes, Verrucomicrobia) with the ten phyla together constituting 99.6-99.9% OTUs. Class level and family level, the cultivars displayed elevated bacterial diversity, but similar taxonomic profiles. Arka Vikas and Arka Abha showed 114 and 107 genera, respectively, with 63 common genera constituting 96-97% OTUs. Psychrobacter formed the dominant genus. Bacillus and related genera constituted only negligible OTU share (0.16-0.28%). KEGG functional analysis showed metabolism as the major bacterial community role.

Unbiased direct-infusion MS using a linear ion trap mass spectrometer allowed metabolic effects to be determined free of any preconceptions and in a high-throughput fashion. Not only the full MS 1 mass spectra (range 150-1,000 mass-to-charge ratio) were obtained but also MS 2 and MS 3 product ion spectra were collected on the most intense MS 1 ions as described previously (Koulman et al., 2007b). We developed a novel computational methodology to take advantage of the MS 2 product ion spectra collected. Several heterogeneous MS 1 bins (different MS 2 spectra from the same nominal MS 1) were identified with this method. Exploratory data analysis approaches were also developed to investigate how the metabolome differs in perennial ryegrass infected with N. lolii in comparison to uninfected perennial ryegrass. As well as some known fungal metabolites like peramine and mannitol, several novel metabolites involved in the symbiosis, including putative cyclic oligopeptides, were identified. Correlation network analysis revealed a group of structurally related oligosaccharides, which differed significantly in concentration in perennial ryegrass sheaths due to endophyte infection. This study demonstrates the potential of the combination of unbiased metabolite profiling using ion trap MS and advanced data-mining strategies for discovering unexpected perturbations of the metabolome, and generating new scientific questions for more detailed investigations in the future.","Cao, M; Koulman, A; Johnson, LJ; Lane, GA; Rasmussen, S",PLANT PHYSIOLOGY,2008,10.1104/pp.107.112458,0.992967703202178,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.89655686072409,0.10344313927591,0.99999981465289,1.85347109882272e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
14488,Biomodulatory Role of Enterobacer Sp: A Novel Bacterial Endophyte of Sida cordifolia and its Comparative Analysis with Plant Extract,"The growing drug resistance among microbes necessitates the identification of novel bioactive compounds from natural sources. The current study focused on isolating prospective endophytic microbes from Sida cordifolia. Different bacterial and fungal endophytes were isolated, among the isolates 3B showed substantial antibacterial and immunomodulatory activity than other isolates. The selected isolate 3B was molecularly identified as Enterobacter sp. based on 16S rDNA typing. A comparison of the biomodulatory role of the isolate Enterobacter sp. (3B) with that of the host plant extract indicated that the isolate gave comparable results with the chloroform extract of S. cordifolia plant. An evaluation on the cytotoxic properties of 3B by MTT assay indicated that it was nontoxic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the antibacterial and immunomodulatory role of Enterobacter isolate. The isolation of such promising strains with antibacterial and immunity uplifting properties would surely be promising to biomedicine with the growing antibiotic resistance and hunt for novel therapeutic alternatives. © 2016, © 2016, Har Krishan Bhalla & Sons.",Rajan D.; George T.; Divakaran D.; Rebello S.; Jisha M.S.,Journal of Biologically Active Products from Nature,2016,10.1080/22311866.2016.1269613,0.973569489347961,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.950841613961769,0.0491583860382312,0.999998544954474,1.45504552617748e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
20210,"Does fire maintain symbiotic, fungal endophyte infections in native grasses?","Systemic endophytic fungi in agronomic and turf grasses are well known for conferring increased resistance to herbivores and to abiotic stresses, such as drought, and increasing competitive abilities. Many native grasses also harbor high frequencies of the asexual and vertically-transmitted endophyte, Neotyphodium. In Festuca arizonica (Arizona fescue), frequency of Neotyphodium-infected plants is often high, but variable, within and among populations. However, Neotyphodium infections in native Arizona fescue, unlike infected agronomic grasses, do not increase resistance to herbivores, do not generally increase drought resistance and do not increase competitive abilities. Native grasses, however are often subjected to another important abiotic stress, fire, which is not normally associated with turf and pasture grasses. Endophyte-related resistance to frequent fires is an alternative explanation for the maintenance of high frequencies of this endophyte in native grasses. We tested the hypothesis that infection by Neotyphodium increases resistance to the direct and indirect effects of fire.","Faeth, SH; Haase, SM; Sackett, SS; Sullivan, TJ; Remington, RK; Hamilton, CE",SYMBIOSIS,2002,NA,0.904786713452214,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.690053796863102,0.309946203136898,0.999952258917002,4.77410829983205e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
11484,"Year, Location, and Variety Impact on Grape-Associated Mycobiota of Arkansas-Grown Wine Grapes for Wine Production","Wine grape berries (Vitis spp.) harbor a wide variety of yeasts and filamentous fungi that impact grapevine health and the winemaking process. Identification of these fungi could be important for controlling and improving wine production. The use of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) strategies has enabled identification and quantification of bacterial and fungal species in vineyards. The aims of this study were to identify mycobiota from Cabernet Sauvignon and Zinfandel (V. vinifera), Carlos and Noble muscadines (V. rotundifolia), Cynthiana (V. aestivalis), and Vignoles hybrid (cross of different Vitis spp.) grapes, and investigate the effect of grape variety, location, and year on grape fungal communities. Grape berries were collected in 2016 and 2017 from four vineyards located in Arkansas. The HTS of the Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 region was used to identify grape indigenous epiphytic and endophytic fungal communities. The predominant genera identified on the Arkansas wine grapes were Uwebraunia, Zymoseptoria, Papiliotrema, Meyerozyma, Filobasidium, and Curvibasidium. Overall, the data suggested that grape fungal community distribution and relative abundance were influenced by grape variety, year, and location, but each was influenced to a different extent. Not only were grape mycobiota influenced by year, variety, and location but also it appeared that communities from the previous year impacted microbial communities the following year. For example, an increase of the mycoparasite Ampelomyces quisqualis was noticed in 2017 on grapes that carried the causal agent of powdery mildew, Erysiphe necator, in 2016, thus, amplifying the importance of vineyard microbiota knowledge for disease management and winemaking.","Cureau, N; Threlfall, R; Marasini, D; Lavefve, L; Carbonero, F",MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,2021,10.1007/s00248-021-01705-y,0.960081241397603,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99909190435607,9.0809564393e-4,0.999999999998127,1.87250215333279e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6024,Comparative analysis of endophyte diversity of Dendrobium officinale lived on rock and tree,"Dendrobium officinale usually lives on rock or tree, but their endophyte diversity has not yet been fully revealed? In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to investigate the endophyte diversity of the roots of D. officinale lived on tree (Group 1-3, arboreal type) and rock (Group 4, lithophytic type). The results showed that their composition of endophytic fungi and bacteria were similar at phylum level, while their relative abundance were different. Their taxa composition and abundance of endophytes differed significantly among groups at the genus level. Alpha diversity of endophytic fungi of lithophytic type was higher than those from arboreal type, while there was no advantage in endophytic bacteria. Beta diversity revealed that the endophytic fungi tended to cluster in each group, but the endophytic bacteria were dispersed among the groups. LEfSe analysis found that the numbers of predicted endophyte biomarkers of lithophytic type were more than arboreal types at genus level, and the biomarkers varied among groups. Microbial network analysis revealed similarities and differences in the taxa composition and abundance of shared and special endophytes in each group. These results suggested that the root endophytes of lithophytic and arboreal D. officinale differed in diversity.","Li, XL; Hu, H; Ren, QL; Wang, M; Du, YM; He, YQ; Wang, Q",PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY,2023,10.5511/plantbiotechnology.23.0208a,0.973141208578417,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99493887348295,0.00506112651704982,0.999999998470423,1.52957702059808e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1732,Diversity and Antimicrobial Activity of Culturable Fungal Endophytes in Solanum mauritianum,"Plant endophytes are microbial sources of bioactive secondary metabolites, which mimic the natural compounds chemistry of their respective host plants in a similar manner.

Fungal endophytes were isolated from Solanum mauritianum, identified using morphological traits and internal transcribed spacer ribosomal-deoxyribonucleic acid (ITS-rDNA) sequence analysis. Eight fungal endophytes were identified as Aureobasidium pullulans, Paracamarosporium leucadendri, Cladosporium sp., Collectotrichum boninense, Fusarium sp., Hyalodendriella sp., and Talaromyces sp., while Penicillium chrysogenum was isolated from the leaves and unripe fruits. Good activity was observed for the crude extracts of Paracamarosporium leucadendri inhibiting Mycobacterium bovis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 6 mu g/mL. Crude extracts of Fusarium sp., showed activity at 9 mu g/mL against M. bovis, M. smegmatis and K. pneumonia. In general, the crude extracts showed great activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and novel results for two mycobacteria species M. bovis and M. smegmatis.

5673,"Isolation and characterization of antagonistic endophytes from Dendrobium candidum Wall ex Lindl., and the biofertilizing potential of a novel Pseudomonas saponiphila strain","Many endophytic bacterial strains are now successfully used for plant-growth promotion (PGP) and as biocontrol agents (BCA) against plant diseases. This is a promising strategy for the improvement of crop productivity, thereby reducing the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers. The objectives of this study were to isolate endophytic bacteria from the medicinal plant Dendrobium candidum Wall ex Lindl in China, and evaluate the biological control and PGP characteristics of these bacteria. Antagonistic tests were performed against fungal pathogens. Twenty-two of the 83 bacterial isolates showed antagonistic activities. These antagonistic isolates were screened in vitro for PGP traits, such as the production of indoleacetic acid (IAA), siderophores, proteases, and phosphate solubilization. Based on the tested PGP traits, strain YW was selected for further study. Strain YW was identified as Pseudomonas saponiphila based on its 16S rRNA and gyrB gene sequences. We detected the antifungal metabolite-encoding genes phlD, and hcnBC genes encoding 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) from strain YW. We measured the effect of strain YW on the growth of pepper seedlings under greenhouse conditions. Our results showed that its antifungal potential may be attributed to 2,4-DAPG and HCN antibiotics, as well as protease and siderophore production, and growth promotion may be related to the ability of isolate YW to synthesize IAA and solubilize phosphate. The PGP and antifungal activities of strain YW suggest that it may be exploited as a potential bioinoculant agent. This is the first report of a P. saponiphila strain with PGP attributes.

958,Aploneura lentisci (Homoptera: Aphididae) and Its Interactions with Fungal Endophytes in Perennial Ryegrass (Lolium perenne),"Aploneura lentisci Pass. is endemic to the Mediterranean region where it is holocyclic, forming galls on its primary host, Pistacia lentiscus and alternating over a 2-year period between Pistacia and secondary hosts, principally species of Gramineae. This aphid is widely distributed in Australia and New Zealand on the roots of the common forage grasses, ryegrass (Lolium spp.) and tall fescue (Schedonorus phoenix) where it exists as permanent, anholocyclic, parthenogenetic populations. Previous studies have indicated that infestations of A. lentisci significantly reduce plant growth and may account for differences in field performance of Lolium perenne infected with different strains of the fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae var. lolii. These obligate biotrophs protect their host grasses from herbivory via the production of alkaloids. To confirm the hypothesis that growth of L. perenhe is associated with the effect of different endophyte strains on aphid populations, herbage and root growth were measured over time in two pot trials that compared three fungal endophyte strains with an endophyte-free control. In both pot trials, aphid numbers were lowest on plants infected with endophyte strain AR37 at all sampling times. In plants infected with a common toxic strain naturalized in New Zealand, aphid numbers overall were lower than on uninfected plants or those infected with strain AR1, but numbers did not always differ significantly from these treatments. Populations on AR1-infected plants were occasionally significantly higher than those on endophyte-free. Cumulative foliar growth was reduced in AR1 and Nil treatments relative to AR37 in association with population differences of A. lentisci in both trials and root dry weight was reduced in one trial. In four Petri dish experiments survival of A. lentisci on plants infected with AR37 declined to low levels after an initial phase of up to 19 days during which time aphids fed and populations were similar to those on plants without endophyte. Aphids on AR37-infected plants became uncoordinated in their movement and developed tremors before dying suggesting a neurotoxin was responsible for their mortality. Results support the hypothesis that differences in A. lentisci populations due to endophyte infection status and strain affects plant growth.","Popay, AJ; Cox, NR",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2016,10.3389/fpls.2016.01395,0.997873566457789,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999999999213468,7.86532088626274e-10,1,0,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15030,Identification and characterization of Cladosporium species associated with tea plants (Camellia sinensis) in China,"The tea plant (Camellia sinensis) is widely cultivated worldwide as one of the most popular non-alcoholic beverage crops. Cladosporium, the dominant endophytic genus of leaves, possesses a variety of biotransformation and metabolic abilities to promote the accumulation of secondary metabolites. However, Cladosporium species in tea leaves remain unexplored. In this study, a total of 79 Cladosporium isolates were obtained from the leaves of several tea varieties in China. Multilocus phylogenetic analysis and morphological characteristics revealed six known species, namely, C. angulosum, C. anthropophilum, C. halotolerans, C. perangustum, C. tenuissimum and C. xanthochromaticum, and one novel species named C. camelliae. C. angulosum was the most dominant species, and the other six species were newly recorded in tea plants. Pathogenicity tests showed no obvious symptoms of disease in tea leaves caused by 13 representative strains of these seven Cladosporium species. Subsequently, three frequently used fungicides were tested, including chlorothalonil, pyraclostrobin and thiophanate-methyl. The EC50 values against C. tenuissimum were 19.14, 0.548 and 3.796 μg/mL, respectively. Based on these EC50 values, the inhibition effects of the three fungicides on six strains from six species (C. angulosum, C. anthropophilum, C. camelliae, C. perangustum, C. tenuissimum and C. xanthochromaticum) were further compared. Pyraclostrobin had the strongest inhibitory effects on the mycelial growth of Cladosporium, followed by thiophanate-methyl, and chlorothalonil showed the weakest inhibitory effect.

15231,Microbial diversity composition of apple tree roots and resistance of apple Valsa canker with different grafting rootstock types,"Background: The composition and diversity of root microbial community are affected by plant genotypes and soil environment, which in turn affect plant growth and development. Grafting rootstock types of the apple tree can affect phenotypes in cultivation practice, but it is not clear whether grafting rootstock types can affect the composition and diversity of root microbial community and the resistance of apple tree to apple Valsa canker. Methods: To explore root microbial differences and the correlation, 16S rRNA and ITS genes were sequenced using Novaseq technology. Results: The results showed that the influence of grafting rootstock types on the composition of the root fungal community was greater than that of bacteria. And the bacterial community richness was higher in the healthy (OTUs: 1693) and dwarfing rootstock (OTUs: 1526) than in the disease (OTUs: 1181) and standard rootstock (OTUs: 1412), while the fungal community richness was the opposite. Moreover, the bacterial abundance of root zone, rhizosphere, and root endophytic microorganisms with the same grafting rootstock type exhibited a decreasing trend. Results of Nested PCR assay on soil and root tissue of Valsa mali showed that the content of V. mali in dwarfing rootstocks are lower than standard rootstocks. These results suggest that apple trees grafting with dwarfing rootstocks are more resistant to V. mali than standard rootstocks. Conclusions: Under different grafting types, the effect on the composition of fungal community in apple tree root was greater than that of bacteria. The bacterial community in dwarfing rootstocks is more abundant and diverse, including more beneficial microorganisms. Therefore, dwarfing rootstock is more conducive to the resistance to apple Valsa canker from biological control. © 2022, The Author(s).",Wang J.; Wang R.; Kang F.; Yan X.; Sun L.; Wang N.; Gong Y.; Gao X.; Huang L.,BMC Microbiology,2022,10.1186/s12866-022-02517-x,0.985523367268882,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998882078800691,0.00111792119930895,0.999989591129666,1.04088703336558e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Based on morphological and molecular identification, the endophytic fungi isolated were classified into seven genera (Hypocrea, Penicillium, Tolypocladium, Chaetomium, Xylaria, Nemania, and Creosphaeria), all belonging to one family (Xylariaceae). By screening with the 2,2'-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) decolorization assay, the ethyl acetate extracts of five endophytic fungi (T7, T21, T24, T32, and T38 strains), which exhibited remarkable Trolox equivalent (TE) antioxidant capacity (ranging from 997.06 to 1248.10 mu mol TE/g extract), were selected and their antioxidant capacity was further evaluated by assays for 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, hydroxyl radical scavenging, reducing power, and ferrous ion chelating. The ethyl acetate extracts of two endophytic fungi (T24 and T38) were found to have comparable scavenging abilities on both DPPH-free radicals (93.9 and 88.7%, respectively, at 50 mu g/mL) and hydroxyl radicals (97.1 and 89.4%, respectively, at 2 mg/mL) when compared with those of the positive controls (ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxytoluene, respectively). Although their reducing powers were similar to that of butylated hydroxytoluene, as indicated by absorbance (0.35 and 0.30 at 50 mu g/mL, respectively), only the T38 strain's ethyl acetate extract showed ferrous ion chelating ability (92.9% at 1 mg/mL) comparable to that of the EDTA-2Na control.

18554,Impact of Soil Salinity on the Structure of the Bacterial Endophytic Community Identified from the Roots of Caliph Medic (Medicago truncatula).,"In addition to being a forage crop, Caliph medic (Medicago truncatula) is also a model legume plant and is used for research focusing on the molecular characterization of the interaction between rhizobia and plants. However, the endophytic microbiome in this plant is poorly defined. Endophytic bacteria play a role in supplying plants with the basic requirements necessary for growth and development. Moreover, these bacteria also play a role in the mechanism of salinity stress adaptation in plants. As a prelude to the isolation and utilization of these bacteria in Caliph medic farming, 41 bacterial OTUs were identified in this project from within the interior of the roots of this plant by pyrosequencing of the small ribosomal subunit gene (16S rDNA) using a cultivation-independent approach. In addition, the differential abundance of these bacteria was studied following exposure of the plants to salinity stress. About 29,064 high-quality reads were obtained from the sequencing of six libraries prepared from control and salinity-treated tissues. Statistical analysis revealed that the abundance of ~70% of the OTUs was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) altered in roots that were exposed to salinity stress. Sequence analysis showed a similarity between some of the identified species and other, known, growth-promoting bacteria, marine and salt-stressed soil-borne bacteria, and nitrogen-fixing bacterial isolates. Determination of the amendments to the bacterial community due to salinity stress in Caliph medic provides a crucial step toward developing an understanding of the association of these endophytes, under salt stress conditions, in this model plant. To provide direct evidence regarding their growth promoting activity, a group of endophytic bacteria were isolated from inside of plant roots using a cultivation-dependent approach. Several of these isolates were able to produce ACC-deaminase, ammonia and IAA; and to solubilize Zn+2 and PO4-3. This data is consistent with the predicted occurrence (based on cultivation-independent techniques) of these bacteria and provides some insight into the importance of the endophytic bacteria in Caliph medic when grown under normal and saline conditions.",Yaish MW; Al-Lawati A; Jana GA; Vishwas Patankar H; Glick BR,PloS one,2016,10.1371/journal.pone.0159007,0.948771381323765,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.986843409646047,0.0131565903539531,0.999999991777554,8.22244583531528e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
13013,Greenhouse and field evaluations of potassium phosphonate: The control of Phytophthora foot rot of black pepper in Vietnam,"Phytophthora foot rot of black pepper caused by Phytophthora capsici is a major disease of black pepper throughout production areas in Vietnam. The disease causes collar, foot and tap root rots and eventual death of the infected vine. Potassium phosphonate was evaluated for the control of this disease in greenhouse and field trials. In greenhouse trials three-month-old vines treated with phosphonate by soil drenching (10-20 g a.i./l) and then inoculated with P. capsici mycelium (2% v/v soil) had significantly less foot rot compared to vines grown in non-treated soil. In field trials mature vines were treated with phosphonate at 50-100 g a.i/pole soil drenching or 10 g a.i./l by root infusion. After 10 days root, stem and leaf specimens were removed for bioassay by inoculation with 5 ml of P. capsici zoospores suspension (10 6-10 8 spores/ml). Soil drenching with phosphonate inhibited the colonisation of pathogen on excised leaf, stem and root tissues, significantly more than phosphonate root infusion. Our study provides further evidence supporting the efficacy of potassium phosphonate in the management of black pepper foot rot caused by P. capsici.

Intriguingly, 27.5Mb of repeat sequences that accounted for 42.97% of the genome was identified, and long terminal repeat retrotransposons were the most frequent known transposable elements, indicating that transposable element proliferation contributes to its increased genome size. BUSCO analyses using the Fungi_odb10 data set showed that 95.0% of genes were complete. In addition, 292 carbohydrate active enzymes, 33 secondary metabolite clusters, and 84 putative effectors were identified in silico. The resulting high-quality assembly and genome features are not only an important resource for further research on understanding the mechanism of root-fungi symbiotic interactions but will also contribute to comparative analyses of genome biology and evolution within Pleosporalean species.","He, XH; Yuan, ZL",GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2021,10.1093/gbe/evab026,0.990263866752771,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999926652514074,7.33474859263268e-5,0.999999999998732,1.2679857164243899e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

1537,Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase plays a vital role in Achnatherum inebrians plants host to Epichloe gansuensis by improving growth under nitrogen deficiency,"Low nitrogen negatively affects soil fertility and plant productivity. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) and EpichloA << gansuensis endophytes are two factors that are associated with tolerance of Achnatherum inebrians to abiotic stress. However, the possibility that E. gansuensis interacts with G6PDH in enhancing low nitrogen tolerance of host grasses has not been examined. A. inebrians plants with (E+) and without E. gansuensis (E-) were subjected to different nitrogen concentration treatments (0.1, 1, and 7.5 mM). After 90 days, physiological studies were carried out to investigate the participation of G6PDH in the adaption of host plants to low nitrogen availability. Low nitrogen retarded the growth of A. inebrians. E+ plants had higher total dry weight, chlorophyll a and b contents, net photosynthesis rate, G6PDH activity, and GSH content, while having lower plasma membrane (PM) NADPH oxidase activity, NADPH/NADP(+) ratios, and MDA and H2O2 than in E- A. inebrians plants under low nitrogen concentration. The presence of E. gansuensis played a key role in maintaining the growth of the A. inebrians plants under low nitrogen concentration by regulating G6PDH activity and the NADPH/NADP(+) ratio and improving net photosynthesis rate.","Wang, JF; Nan, ZB; Christensen, MJ; Li, CJ",PLANT AND SOIL,2018,10.1007/s11104-018-3710-x,0.93447001832989,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999183853891282,8.1614610871792e-4,0.999999999998044,1.95610194708706e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

To comprehensively understand the diversity and ecology of this huge kingdom, DNA barcoding targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear ribosomal repeat has been regarded as a prerequisite procedure. By extensively surveying ITS sequences in public databases, we designed new ITS primers with improved coverage across diverse taxonomic groups of fungi compared to existing primers. An in silico analysis based on public sequence databases indicated that the newly designed primers matched 99% of ascomycete and basidiomycete ITS taxa (species, subspecies or varieties), causing little taxonomic bias toward either fungal group. Two of the newly designed primers could inhibit the amplification of plant sequences and would enable the selective investigation of fungal communities in mycorrhizal associations, soil, and other types of environmental samples. Optimal PCR conditions for the primers were explored in an in vitro investigation. The new primers developed in this study will provide a basis for ecological studies on the diversity and community structures of fungi in the era of massive DNA sequencing.","Toju, H; Tanabe, AS; Yamamoto, S; Sato, H",PLOS ONE,2012,10.1371/journal.pone.0040863,0.945168168617654,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.966720057293452,0.0332799427065481,0.999999883893217,1.16106782743763e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
4055,Promotion of sunflower growth under saline water irrigation by the inoculation of beneficial microorganisms,"Soil salinization and fresh water scarcity are amongst the main environmental/agricultural problems, with serious consequences to plant productivity. Amelioration with microorganisms can enhance plant performance under salt conditions. The aim of this work was to evaluate the role of beneficial rhizospheric microorganisms on the growth of sunflower plants irrigated with salinized water with particular attention to nutrient balance and biochemical responses. Sunflower seedlings were inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi Rhizophagus irregularis, the rhizobacteria Chryseobacterium humi ECP37(T), or the bacterial endophyte Ochrobacterium haematophilum ZR3-5, and with a mixed inocula of those microorganisms. Plant growth, nutrient accumulation and lipid peroxidation in plant tissues, and the activity of soil enzymes, were evaluated. Irrigating sunflower plants with saline water resulted in decreases in growth and negative effects in salt stress markers, however the application of bioinoculants enhanced biomass production and accumulation of K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, N and P, reduced Na+ levels in tissues and increased plant antioxidative response. This study contributes to devise inoculation strategies for sunflower cultivation in areas prone to salinization. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, we have investigated the attachment to and internal colonization of Phaseolus vulgaris roots by the H. seropedicae wild-type strain SMR1 and by a strain of H. seropedicae expressing a red fluorescent protein (DsRed) to track the bacterium in the plant tissues. Two-day-old P. vulgaris roots were incubated at 30°C for 15 min with 6 x 10(8) CFU/mL H. seropedicae SMR1 or RAM4. Three days after inoculation, 4 x 10(4) cells of endophytic H. seropedicae SMR1 were recovered per gram of fresh root, and 9 days after inoculation the number of endophytes increased to 4 x 10(6) CFU/g. The identity of the recovered bacteria was confirmed by amplification and sequencing of the 16SrRNA gene. Furthermore, confocal microscopy of P. vulgaris roots inoculated with H. seropedicae RAM4 showed that the bacterial cells were attached to the root surface 15 min after inoculation; fluorescent bacteria were visible in the internal tissues after 24 h and were found in the central cylinder after 72 h, showing that H. seropedicae RAM4 is capable of colonizing the roots of the dicotyledon P. vulgaris.

15634,Volatile emission and biosynthesis in endophytic fungi colonizing black poplar leaves,"Plant volatiles play a major role in plant-insect interactions as defense compounds or attractants for insect herbivores. Recent studies have shown that endophytic fungi are also able to produce volatiles and this raises the question of whether these fungal volatiles influence plant-insect interactions. Here, we qualitatively investigated the volatiles released from 13 endophytic fungal species isolated from leaves of mature black poplar (Populus nigra) trees. The volatile blends of these endophytes grown on agar medium consist of typical fungal compounds, including aliphatic alcohols, ketones and esters, the aromatic alcohol 2-phenylethanol and various sesquiterpenes. Some of the compounds were previously reported as constituents of the poplar volatile blend. For one endophyte, a species of Cladosporium, we isolated and characterized two sesquiterpene synthases that can produce a number of mono- and sesquiterpenes like (E)-β-ocimene and (E)-β-caryophyllene, compounds that are dominant components of the herbivoreinduced volatile bouquet of black poplar trees. As several of the fungus-derived volatiles like 2-phenylethanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol and the sesquiterpene (E)-β-caryophyllene, are known to play a role in direct and indirect plant defense, the emission of volatiles from endophytic microbial species should be considered in future studies investigating tree-insect interactions. © 2021 Beilstein-Institut Zur Forderung der Chemischen Wissenschaften.

Endophytes from bark, twigs and fresh leaves were isolated from both tree species. As observed for other taxonomically related hosts, a certain overlapping between the endophytic mycoflora in both Quercus species was found. The most frequent fungus in both host species was Pyrenochaeta sp., an anamorph of Dothideales. Nevertheless, a certain degree of host specificity in fungal endophytic infection was detected, when the frequencies of the most commonly isolated endophytes were statistically analysed. The tree species affects significantly the distribution of almost all the fungi with isolation frequencies equal or higher than 2%. Moreover, some dominant fungal taxa could be isolated only from a particular host (Q. ilex or Q. faginea). A cluster analysis of the trees computed on the base of the similarity of their whole of fungal populations confirmed that there is an evident influence of the host species on the composition of the fungal assemblages of the trees.

19397,Exploring the Promise of Endophytic Fungi: A Review of Novel Antimicrobial Compounds.,"Over the last few decades, many of the existing drugs used to treat infectious diseases have become increasingly ineffective due to the global emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). As such, there is a constant demand to find new, effective compounds that could help to alleviate some of this pressure. Endophytic fungi have captured the attention of many researchers in this field, as they have displayed a vast ability to produce novel bioactive compounds, many of which possess wide-ranging antimicrobial activities. However, while highly promising, research in this area is still in its infancy. Endophytes inhabit the healthy tissues of plants asymptomatically, resulting in a mutualistic symbiosis in which the endophytes produce a plethora of bioactive compounds that support the fitness of the host plant. These compounds display great chemical diversity, representing structural groups, such as aliphatic compounds, alkaloids, peptides, phenolics, polyketides and terpenoids. In this review, the significant antimicrobial potential of endophytic fungi is detailed, highlighting their ability to produce novel and diverse antimicrobial compounds active against human, plant and marine pathogens. In doing so, it also highlights the significant contributions that endophytic fungi can make in our battle against AMR, thus providing the motivation to increase efforts in the search for new and effective antimicrobial drugs.",Caruso DJ; Palombo EA; Moulton SE; Zaferanloo B,Microorganisms,2022,10.3390/microorganisms10101990,0.84650866110537,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Absence,0.197980309558176,0.802019690441824,0.999272248071516,7.2775192848417e-4,Absence,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Presence,Absence

Infection of pinewood nematode was associated with a significant (P<005) decrease in root colonization rates by ECMF, dark septate endophytes and total hyphae, as well as in fungal biomass in the roots. Illumina MiSeq sequences of tagged amplicons of 18S rDNA region revealed Basidiomycota (6570%) and Ascomycota (3414%) as the dominant root-associated fungi in roots of P. tabulaeformis. Among the detected operational taxonomic units (OTUs), ECMF and dark septate endophytes exhibited a higher relative abundance in trees infected by pinewood nematode compared with noninfected ones. ConclusionsThe infection of pinewood nematode altered the composition and OTU abundance of root-associated fungi community in P. tabulaeformis roots with a decrease in the biomass, species richness and diversity of root-associated fungi, as well as in the colonization rates and abundance of ECMF and dark septate endophytes. Significance and Impact of the StudyThis study is an important contribution for better understanding the interaction between pine wilt disease and root-associated fungi.","Chu, H; Tang, M; Wang, H; Wang, C",JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY,2018,10.1111/jam.13883,0.576922083297326,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.988692143835767,0.0113078561642334,0.99999998964034,1.03596599076994e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
14835,Potential xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity of endophytic Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae,"Xanthine oxidase is considered as a potential target for treatment of hyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia is predisposing factor for gout, chronic heart failure, atherosclerosis, tissue injury, and ischemia. To date, only two inhibitors of xanthine oxidase viz. allopurinol and febuxostat have been clinically approved for used as drugs. In the process of searching for new xanthine oxidase inhibitors, we screened culture filtrates of 42 endophytic fungi using in vitro qualitative and quantitative XO inhibitory assays. The qualitative assay exhibited potential XO inhibition by culture filtrates of four isolates viz. #1048 AMSTITYEL, #2CCSTITD, #6AMLWLS, and #96 CMSTITNEY. The XO inhibitory activity was present only in the chloroform extract of the culture filtrates. Chloroform extract of culture filtrate #1048 AMSTITYEL exhibited the highest inhibition of XO with an IC50 value of 0.61 μg ml -1 which was better than allopurinol exhibiting an IC50 of 0.937 μg ml-1 while febuxostat exhibited a much lower IC 50 of 0.076 μg ml-1. Further, molecular phylogenetic tools and morphological studies were used to identify #1048 AMSTITYEL as Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae. This is the first report of an endophytic Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae from Aegle marmelos exhibiting potential XO Inhibitory activity. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.",Kapoor N.; Saxena S.,Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology,2014,10.1007/s12010-014-0927-x,0.656564553643869,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Absence,0.288807044962614,0.711192955037386,0.995810328481664,0.00418967151833638,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
2723,Succession of tissue microbial community during oat developmental,"Investigating oat tissue microflora during its different developmental stages is necessary for understanding its growth and anti-disease mechanism. In this study, 16S rDNA and ITS (Internally Transcribed Spacer) high-throughput sequencing technology were used to explore the microflora diversity of oat tissue. Twenty-seven samples of leaves, stems, and roots from three developmental stages, namely the seedling stage (SS), jointing stage (JS), and maturity stage (MS), underwent sequencing analysis. The analysis showed that 6480 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified in the examined samples, of which 1698 were fungal and 4782 were bacterial. Furthermore, 126 OTUs were shared by fungi, mainly Ascomycota , Basidiomycota , and Mucoromycota at the phylum level, and 39 OTUs were shared by bacteria, mainly Actinobacteriota and Proteobacteria at the phylum level. The microbial diversity of oat tissue in the three developmental stages showed differences, and the alpha-diversity of the bacteria and beta-diversity of the bacteria and fungi in the roots were higher than those of the stems and leaves. Among the bacteria species, Thiiopseudomonas, Rikenellaceae RC9 gut group , and Brevibacterium were predominant in the leaves, MND1 was predominant in the roots, and Lactobacillus was predominant in the stems. Moreover, Brevibacterium maintained a stable state at all growth stages. In the fungal species, Phomatospora was dominant in the leaves, Kondoa was dominant in the roots, and Pyrenophora was dominant in the stems. All species with a high abundance were related to the growth process of oats and antagonistic bacteria. Furthermore, connection modules were denser in bacterial than in fungal populations. The samples were treated with superoxide dismutase and peroxidase. There were 42 strains associated with SOD (Superoxide dismutase), 60 strains associated with POD (Peroxidase), and 38 strains in total, which much higher than fungi. The network analysis showed that bacteria might have more dense connection modules than fungi, The number of bacterial connections to enzymes were much higher than that of fungi. Furthermore, these results provide a basis for further mechanistic research.","Cheng, C; Zhang, YH; Zhang, LC; Guo, JJ; Xu, SH; Gao, PF; Fan, KX; He, YW; Gong, YC; Zhong, G; Su, SF; Liu, ZG",HELIYON,2024,10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e30276,0.902686287532406,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996721247752814,0.0032787522471856,0.99999999384696,6.1530398554055e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

9536,Effect of endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica on yield and some physiological traits of millet (Panicum miliaceum) under water stress,"Piriformospora indica is one of the cultivable root-colonising endophytic fungi of the order Sebacinales, which efficiently promote plant growth, uptake of nutrients, and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of P. indica on millet (Panicum miliaceum L.) under water-stress conditions. Two field experiments were carried out in a factorial arrangement at Bu-Ali Sina University of Hamedan, Iran, during 2014 and 2015. The first factor was three levels of water-deficit stress, with irrigation after 60mm (well-watered), 90mm (mild stress) and 120mm (severe stress) evaporation from pan class A. The second factor was two levels of fungus P. indica: inoculated and uninoculated. Results showed that water-deficit stress significantly decreased grain yield and yield components. Colonisation by P. indica significantly increased number of panicles per plant, number of grains per panicle and 1000-grain weight, regardless of water supply. Inoculation with P. indica increased grain yield by 11.4% (year 1) and 19.72% (year 2) in well-watered conditions and by 35.34% (year 1) and 32.59% (year 2) under drought stress, compared with uninoculated plants. Maximum flag-leaf area (21.71 cm(2)) was achieved with well-watered conditions. Severe water stress decreased flag-leaf area by 53.36%. Flag-leaf area was increased by 18.64% by fungus inoculation compared with the uninoculated control. Under drought conditions, inoculation with P. indica increased plant height by 27.07% and panicle length by 9.61%. Severe water stress caused a significant decrease in grain phosphorus concentration, by 42.42%, compared with the well-watered treatment. By contrast, grain nitrogen and protein contents were increased about 30.23% and 30.18%, respectively, with severe water stress. Inoculation with P. indica increased grain phosphorus by 24.22%, nitrogen by 7.47% and protein content by 7.54% compared with control. Water stress reduced leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations, whereas P. indica inoculation enhanced chlorophyll concentrations by 27.18% under severe water stress. The results indicated the positive effect of P. indica on yield and physiological traits of millet in both well-watered and water-stressed conditions.","Ahmadvand, G; Hajinia, S",CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE,2018,10.1071/CP17364,0.987757846874765,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.981408123741776,0.0185918762582243,0.999999999878233,1.21767373961745e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Yet, we lack insights into how urbanization influences foliar fungal communities. We created detailed maps of Stockholm region's climate and air quality and characterized foliar fungi from mature oaks (Quercus robur) across climatic, air quality and local habitat gradients. Fungal richness was higher in locations with high growing season relative humidity, and fungal community composition was structured by growing season maximum temperature, NO2 concentration and leaf litter cover. The relative abundance of mycoparasites and endophytes increased with temperature. The relative abundance of pathogens was lowest with high concentrations of NO2 and particulate matter (PM2.5), while saprotrophs increased with leaf litter cover. Our findings show that urbanization influences foliar fungi, providing insights for developing management guidelines to promote tree health, prevent disease outbreaks and maintain biodiversity within urban landscapes.","Faticov, M; Amorim, JH; Abdelfattah, A; van Dijk, LJA; Carvalho, AC; Laforest-Lapointe, I; Tack, AJM",AMBIO,2024,10.1007/s13280-024-02041-4,0.988990672661123,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999994753704558,5.24629544220425e-6,0.999999999997725,2.27473595515448e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5795,An endophyte from salt-adapted Pokkali rice confers salt-tolerance to a salt-sensitive rice variety and targets a unique pattern of genes in its new host,"Endophytes, both of bacterial and fungal origin, are ubiquitously present in all plants. While their origin and evolution are enigmatic, there is burgeoning literature on their role in promoting growth and stress responses in their hosts. We demonstrate that a salt-tolerant endophyte isolated from salt-adapted Pokkali rice, a Fusarium sp., colonizes the salt-sensitive rice variety IR-64, promotes its growth under salt stress and confers salinity stress tolerance to its host. Physiological parameters, such as assimilation rate and chlorophyll stability index were higher in the colonized plants. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed 1348 up-regulated and 1078 down-regulated genes in plants colonized by the endophyte. Analysis of the regulated genes by MapMan and interaction network programs showed that they are involved in both abiotic and biotic stress tolerance, and code for proteins involved in signal perception (leucine-rich repeat proteins, receptor-like kinases) and transduction (Ca2+ and calmodulin-binding proteins), transcription factors, secondary metabolism and oxidative stress scavenging. For nine genes, the data were validated by qPCR analysis in both roots and shoots. Taken together, these results show that salt-adapted Pokkali rice varieties are powerful sources for the identification of novel endophytes, which can be used to confer salinity tolerance to agriculturally important, but salt-sensitive rice varieties.","Sampangi-Ramaiah, MH; Jagadheesh; Dey, P; Jambagi, S; Kumari, MMV; Oelmüller, R; Nataraja, KN; Ravishankar, KV; Ravikanth, G; Shaanker, RU",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2020,10.1038/s41598-020-59998-x,0.939829762134649,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.977303871424997,0.0226961285750026,0.999999939413803,6.05861968372423e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The occurrence of two species with different life strategies on different Pinus trees across Slovakia was detected by PCR using species-specific primers. In general, the commensalistic species L. pinastri was more frequent than parasitic L. seditiosum. There were no significant differences observed between urban and natural environments, but natural environments have more frequent colonization by L. pinastri and less frequent were trees negatively tested to Lophodermium colonization. Among the most frequently sampled trees were non-native P. nigra and native P. sylvestris. A significant difference in Lophodermium incidence was detected between these two species in a natural environment, with increased frequency of L. pinastri on native Scots pine. In addition to one clade of L. pinastri, culture based species identification confirmed the presence of L. corconticum and an undescribed clade of L. seditiosum that is not sensitive to used PCR primers for the species detection.","Ondrusková, E; Adamcík, S; Kobza, M; Jánosíková, Z; Ostrovsky, R; Pastircáková, K; Cabon, M; Adamciková, K",SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH,2023,10.1080/02827581.2023.2191004,0.878135695961844,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.788606800515497,0.211393199484503,0.999999679611489,3.20388510832714e-7,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

Microbial symbionts of plants profoundly influence host water relations (Lösch & Gansert 2002), but are rarely considered in studies of tropical plant physiology. In particular, plant-fungus associations, which are ubiquitous in plant communities and especially common in tropical forests, play important and varied roles in plant water status. Fungal pathogens associated with roots, vascular tissue and foliage may interfere with water uptake and transport, increase rates of foliar transpiration, and induce xylem embolism and tissue death (Agrios 1997).

12070,Combined phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms jointly promote Pinus massoniana growth by modulating rhizosphere environment and key biological pathways in seedlings,"Pinus massoniana is an important afforestation and industrial timber tree species in China; However, its growth and productivity are often suffered from phosphorus deficiency. Phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms (PSMs) can increase phosphorus efficiency and may have the important potential for use in forestry ecosystem. In order to evaluate whether the co-inoculation of PSMs would enhance plant growth than single inoculation, and better understand the synergistic mechanisms of PSM compound strains regulating P. massoniana growth, we used plant physiology, microbiome, and transcriptome technologies to assess the effects of combined PSMs on plant growth, rhizosphere microecology and plant physiological system. The results demonstrated that combined endophytic fungus (Penicillum oxalicum G17) and rhizosphere bacteria (Burkholderia sp. WJ27) significantly increased phosphate-dissolving ratio and promoted P. massoniana growth compared with a single strain or non-inoculation. The combination of G17 and WJ27 strains (G17&WJ27) evidently enhanced soil nutrients, as well as P, N, and K contents in seedlings. Although the diversities of fungi and bacteria were reduced under G17&WJ27 treatment, the relative abundances of ectomycorrhizal fungi (Trichophaea and Thelephora) and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (Sphingomonas, Burkholderia, Chitinophaga, Ramlibacter, and Rhodanobacter) increased. Tran-scriptome profiles showed that compared with non-inoculated plants, there were 7115 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in G17&WJ27 treatment, which were involved in various biological pathways associated with growth regulation, including photosynthesis, sugar metabolism, antioxidant enzyme activity, plant hor-mones, amino acid biosynthesis, and inorganic phosphate transporters.

Microscopic observations revealed that 58 to 97 % of gametophytes in all species were colonized with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Fungal colonization was limited to the multilayered midrib (cushion) tissue in all gametophytes examined. Molecular identification using fungal SSU rDNA sequences indicated that the AM fungi in gametophytes primarily belonged to the Glomeraceae, but also included the Claroideoglomeraceae, Gigasporaceae, Acaulosporaceae, and Archaeosporales. This study provides the first evidence for AM fungal colonization of wild gametophytes in the Plagiogyriaceae and Cyatheaceae.

Our results demonstrated the presence of Basidiomycetes. Sebacinales (81.61 %) and Cantharellales (12.10 %) were the dominant orders and are potential candidates for orchid mycorrhizal fungi.

A Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') analysis showed a relatively high fungal community diversity associated with these tropical orchids. This diversity may offer greater flexibility in terms of the adaptation of the plants to changing environmental conditions and the potential facilitation of reintroduction programs.

14380,"Glutamicibacter halophytocola sp. nov., an endophytic actinomycete isolated from the roots of a coastal halophyte, Limonium sinense","A novel actinobacterium, designated KLBMP 5180T, was isolated from the surface-sterilized root of a coastal halophyte, Limonium sinense, collected from the city of Lianyungang, Jiangsu Province, eastern China. The isolate was Gram-stainpositive, aerobic and non-motile. The components of the cell-wall peptidoglycan were lysine, glutamic acid and alanine. The predominant menaquinone was MK-9. The polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, one unknown phospholipid, one unidentified glycolipid and two unidentified lipids. anteiso-C15: 0 and iso-C16: 0 were the major cellular fatty acids. The DNA G+C content of strain KLBMP 5180T was 60.0 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain KLBMP 5180T belongs to the genus Glutamicibacter and was related most closely to Glutamicibacter nicotianae DSM 20123T (99.3% similarity), Glutamicibacterarilaitensis Re117T (99.3%) and Glutamicibacter mysorens LMG 16219T (99.1%); similarity to other type strains of the genus Glutamicibacter was lower than 98.5%. However, DNA–DNA relatedness values between strain KLBMP 5180T, G. nicotianae DSM 20123T, G. arilaitensis Re117T and G. mysorens LMG 16219T were 47.5±2.6, 51.3±3.1 and 41.2±4.3%, respectively. The combination of DNA–DNA hybridization, phylogenetic, phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data supported the suggestion that strain KLBMP 5180T represents a novel species of the genus Glutamicibacter, for which the name Glutamicibacter halophytocola sp. nov. is proposed.

18670,Cellular Solutions: Evaluating Single-Cell Proteins as Sustainable Feed Alternatives in Aquaculture.,"The rapid expansion of the global population has intensified the demand for protein-rich food sources, positioning aquaculture as a crucial sector in the endeavor to alleviate global hunger through the provision of high-quality aquatic protein. Traditional protein sources such as fishmeal have historically served as the foundation of aquafeeds; however, their elevated costs and limited availability have catalyzed the search for sustainable alternatives. These alternatives encompass plant-based proteins, insect meals, and, more recently, single-cell proteins (SCPs), which are derived from microorganisms including bacteria, yeast, fungi, and microalgae. Nonetheless, SCP remains in its nascent stages and currently accounts for only a minor fraction of aquafeed formulations relative to other established alternatives. The production of SCP utilizes low-cost substrates, such as agricultural and dairy wastes, thereby supporting waste mitigation and principles of the circular economy. This review elucidates the nutritional value of SCPs, their potential for biofortification, and their emerging roles as functional feeds with immunomodulatory and nutrigenomic effects. Additionally, the review underscores the potential of endophytes as a novel SCP source, highlighting their underutilized capacity to foster sustainable innovations in aquafeeds.",Chamodi KKD; Vu NT; Domingos JA; Loh JY,Biology,2025,10.3390/biology14070764,0.582112508496675,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.95175738410039,0.0482426158996101,0.999998255021806,1.74497819438457e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
1631,Epiphytic and terrestrial mycorrhizas in a lower montane Costa Rican cloud forest,"The epiphyte community is the most diverse plant community in neotropical cloud forests and its collective biomass can exceed that of the terrestrial shrubs and herbs. However, little is known about the role of mycorrhizas in this community. We assessed the mycorrhizal status of epiphytic (Araceae, Clusiaceae, Ericaceae, and Piperaceae) and terrestrial (Clusiaceae, Ericaceae) plants in a lower montane cloud forest in Costa Rica. Arbuscular mycorrhizas were observed in taxa from Araceae and Clusiaceae; ericoid mycorrhizas were observed in ericaceous plants. This is the first report of intracellular hyphal coils characteristic of ericoid mycorrhizas in roots of Cavendishia melastomoides, Disterigma humboldtii, and Gaultheria erecta. Ericaceous roots were also covered by an intermittent hyphal mantle that penetrated between epidermal cells. Mantles, observed uniquely on ericaceous roots, were more abundant on terrestrial than on epiphytic roots. Mantle abundance was negatively correlated with gravimetric soil water content for epiphytic samples. Dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungi colonized roots of all four families. For the common epiphyte D. humboldtii, DSE structures were most abundant on samples collected from exposed microsites in the canopy. The presence of mycorrhizas in all epiphytes except Peperomia sp. suggests that inoculum levels and environmental conditions in the canopy of tropical cloud forests are generally conducive to the formation of mycorrhizas. These may impact nutrient and water dynamics in arboreal ecosystems.","Rains, KC; Nadkarni, NM; Bledsoe, CS",MYCORRHIZA,2003,10.1007/s00572-003-0224-y,0.985413936879534,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997092007272221,0.00290799272777867,0.999999999999999,6.66133814775094e-16,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15763,Increased flower production of calibrachoa x hybrida by the soil fungus mortierella elongata1,"Calibrachoa (Calibrachoa x hybrida) is a highly valued solanaceous flowering ornamental plant, characterized by its drought-hardiness, abundant flowering, and diverse flower colors. Recently, the saprobic soil fungus Mortierella elongata was isolated as a root endophyte from eastern cottonwood (Populus deltoides) and identified as a potential biological amendment for bioenergy and food crops. Two greenhouse experiments were conducted by transplanting rooted cuttings of Calibrachoa cv. ‘Kabloom Deep Blue’ into a potting media mixture amended with 1 or 2% volume mix ratio of millet seed colonized with one of four isolates of M. elongata. Plants were assessed weekly for flower production and 86 days post inoculation for leaf/stem, root, and total dry weight. M. elongata strain 624-significantly increased flower production compared to the non-inoculated millet seed controls at 6 and 7 wk post amendment in both experiments. Above and below ground vegetative dry weight for plants grown in potting media mixture amended with M. elongata isolates varied across isolates, fungal amendment concentrations, and experiments. Our results suggest that potting media mixture amended with M. elongata strain 624-can increase flower production of Calibrachoa during peak marketable periods. © 2020 Horticultural Research Institute.",Becker L.E.; Cubeta M.A.,Journal of Environmental Horticulture,2020,10.24266/0738-2898-38.4.114,0.979004782878911,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.884262665454436,0.115737334545564,0.999533132809856,4.6686719014354e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
11192,Diverse Bacteria Inhabit Living Hyphae of Phylogenetically Diverse Fungal Endophytes,"Both the establishment and outcomes of plant-fungus symbioses can be influenced by abiotic factors, the interplay of fungal and plant genotypes, and additional microbes associated with fungal mycelia. Recently bacterial endosymbionts were documented in soilborne Glomeromycota and Mucoromycotina and in at least one species each of mycorrhizal Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. Here we show for the first time that phylogenetically diverse endohyphal bacteria occur in living hyphae of diverse foliar endophytes, including representatives of four classes of Ascomycota. We examined 414 isolates of endophytic fungi, isolated from photosynthetic tissues of six species of cupressaceous trees in five biogeographic provinces, for endohyphal bacteria using microscopy and molecular techniques. Viable bacteria were observed within living hyphae of endophytic Pezizomycetes, Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes, and Sordariomycetes from all tree species and biotic regions surveyed. A focus on 29 fungus/bacterium associations revealed that bacterial and fungal phylogenies were incongruent with each other and with taxonomic relationships of host plants. Overall, eight families and 15 distinct genotypes of endohyphal bacteria were recovered; most were members of the Proteobacteria, but a small number of Bacillaceae also were found, including one that appears to occur as an endophyte of plants. Frequent loss of bacteria following subculturing suggests a facultative association. Our study recovered distinct lineages of endohyphal bacteria relative to previous studies, is the first to document their occurrence in foliar endophytes representing four of the most species-rich classes of fungi, and highlights for the first time their diversity and phylogenetic relationships with regard both to the endophytes they inhabit and the plants in which these endophyte-bacterium symbiota occur.","Hoffman, MT; Arnold, AE",APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY,2010,10.1128/AEM.02928-09,0.664485759530192,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.948579660218679,0.0514203397813211,0.999993770832054,6.22916794623674e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
9505,"Lasiodiplodia sp ME4-2, an endophytic fungus from the floral parts of Viscum coloratum, produces indole-3-carboxylic acid and other aromatic metabolites","Background: Studies on endophytes, a relatively under-explored group of microorganisms, are currently popular amongst biologists and natural product researchers. A fungal strain (ME4-2) was isolated from flower samples of mistletoe (Viscum coloratum) during a screening program for endophytes. As limited information on floral endophytes is available, the aim of the present study is to characterise fungal endophytes using their secondary metabolites. Results: ME4-2 grew well in both natural and basic synthetic media but produced no conidia. Sequence analysis of its internal transcribed spacer rDNA demonstrated that ME4-2 forms a distinct branch within the genus Lasiodiplodia and is closely related to L. pseudotheobromae. This floral endophyte was thus identified as Lasiodiplodia sp. based on its molecular biological characteristics. Five aromatic compounds, including cyclo-(Trp-Ala), indole-3-carboxylic acid (ICA), indole-3-carbaldehyde, mellein and 2-phenylethanol, were found in the culture. The structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic methods combined with gas chromatography. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to report isolation of these aromatic metabolites from a floral endophyte. Interestingly, ICA, a major secondary metabolite produced by ME4-2, seemed to be biosynthesized via an unusual pathway. Furthermore, our results indicate that the fungus ME4-2 is a potent producer of 2-phenylethanol, which is a common component of floral essential oils. Conclusions: This study introduces a fungal strain producing several important aromatic metabolites with pharmaceutical or food applications and suggests that endophytic fungi isolated from plant flowers are promising natural sources of aromatic compounds.","Qian, CD; Fu, YH; Jiang, FS; Xu, ZH; Cheng, DQ; Ding, B; Gao, CX; Ding, ZS",BMC MICROBIOLOGY,2014,10.1186/s12866-014-0297-0,0.877028444749346,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995383206240453,0.00461679375954667,0.999999999893435,1.06564534974041e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16129,Efficacy of fungal consortium from Tezpur litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) in remediation of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd)contaminated soil,"We investigated mycoremediation potential of endophytic and rhizospheric fungi from Tezpur litchi in lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) contaminated soil. Fungal strains Aspergillus aculeatus, Penicillium citrinum, Fusarium solani, and two Mycelia sterilia documented high Pb (> 95%) and Cd (> 85%) absorption capacities. The consortium developed by using these fungal strains was applied to Pb (75, 100 and 150 mg kg⁻1) and Cd (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mg kg⁻1) contaminated soil under tomato cultivation till the flowering stage of the plants. Applied consortium increased fungal colony-forming units (CFUs) by 2–3 folds. It also significantly (p ≤ 0.05) enhanced shoot biomass (upto 132.8% under Pb and 80.1% under Cd) of tomato plants. Consortia reduced the accumulation of Pb in tomato plants upto 64.16%, while Cd uptake decreased (upto 10.31%). Significant (p ≤ 0.05) improvement in photosynthesis rates of tomato plants was noted under Pb exposure (upto 58.8%) than Cd (upto 9.2%) due to application of consortium. The results highlight the potential of the tested endophytic and rhizospheric fungal strains from Tezpur litchi for remediating Pb in contaminated soils. Additionally, the study suggests the possible application of the fungal consortium for Cd phytoextraction using hyperaccumulator plants, thereby paving the way for sustainable heavy metal remediation strategies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.",Roy A.; Kerketta N.; Bora P.B.; Goswami P.; Gogoi N.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,2025,10.1007/s11356-025-36078-z,0.959068022115117,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985535405269104,0.0144645947308957,0.999999996809541,3.1904588970732603e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
7562,Community assembly and potential function analysis of the endophyte in Eucommia ulmoides,"Endophytes play a pivotal role in protecting host plants from both biotic and abiotic stresses, promoting the production of active components (AC) and plant growth. However, the succession of the endophyte community in Eucommia ulmoides (E. ulmoides), particularly the community assembly and function, has not been extensively investigated. In this study, we employed high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics tools to analyze endophyte diversity across different tree ages, parts, and periods. We examined the population differences, correlations, community assembly mechanisms, and functional roles of these endophytes. Functional predictions via PICRUSt2 revealed that most endophytic fungal functions were linked to biosynthesis, with significant differences in biosynthetic functional abundance across parts and periods. In contrast, the metabolic activity of endophytic bacteria remained stable across different periods and parts. Correlation analysis further confirmed a strong positive relationship between ACs and certain endophytic fungi. Among them, the fungal phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were identified as key contributors to the metabolism of chlorogenic acid (CA), while Aucubin was significantly positively correlated with several endophytic bacteria. These findings provide valuable insights into the functional roles and community assembly mechanism of E. ulmoides endophytes, as well as their symbiotic relationships.","Tang, YZ; Tian, CL; Yao, D; Yang, S; Shi, LF; Yi, LB; Peng, QZ",BMC MICROBIOLOGY,2024,10.1186/s12866-024-03601-0,0.985282698161342,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.977330306644828,0.0226696933551718,0.999999926752894,7.32471058251249e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

METHODS: SMEFGB were cultured. The secondary metabolites of endophytic fungi was extracted, purified and identified. The effects of secondary metabolites on proliferation, apoptosis and migration of human cervical cancer HeLa cells were determined. In addition, the effects of SMEFGB on growth of Hela implanted tumor in mice were investigated. RESULTS: In 9 stains of endophytic fungi successfully isolated from the leaves of Ginkgo biloba, the stain J-1, J-2 and J-3 could produce podophyllotoxin. These 3 stains were identified by molecular biology. The secondary metabolites of stain J-1, J-2 and J-3 markedly inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells, promoted their apoptosis and blocked their migration. In addition, the secondary metabolites of stain J-1, J-2 and J-3 significantly attenuated the growth of HeLa implanted tumor in mice.

5729,PHYLOGENY OF PLECTOSPHAERELLA MELONIS STRAIN 502 AND VARIETAL SENSITIVITY OF CUCUMBER PLANTS,"Aim. To investigate the phylogenetic relations of P. melonis strain 502 and to study the varietal sensitivity of cucumber plants to P. melonis strain 502. Methods. DNA was extracted using the enzymatic lysis buffer. The PCR was conducted following White et al. protocol (1990). The obtained PCR-products were determined by sequencing on the automatic capillary sequencer Applied Biosystems ABI Prism 3130. The sequence of the gene 5.8S rRNA of P. melonis strain 502 was compared to the sequences from the GenBank database using the BLAST analysis. The phylogenetic analysis was conducted by the neighbor-joining method. The evolutionary distances were estimated by the method of Jukes & Cantor. The evolutionary analysis was conducted in MEGA7. The sensitivity of cucumber plants was determined during a vegetative experiment with artificial infection background (MB), created by introducing the infectious material of fungus P. melonis strain 502 into the soil. The infectious material was introduced at a rate of 50 thousand CFU/per 1 g of soil. The damage to the root system was assessed after 14 days of cultivating plants on the M.13. The disease severity index (DSI) was estimated to determine the general sensitivity of the investigated varieties. The varieties, which received DSI <2.0, were considered highly resistant, from 2.0 to 2.9 - moderately resistant, from 3.0 to 3.9 - susceptible, and 4.0 or higher - very susceptible. The statistical methods and Statistica 12 (Stat-Soft Inc., USA) were used to assess the reliability of the experimental data. The arithmetic mean and the square deviation (SD) were calculated to assess the DSI at p < 0.05. Results. The PCR method was used to obtain a sequence of P. melonis strain 502 of 317 bp and to conduct the phylogenetic analysis. The search of BLASTn in GenBank showed that the sequence of ITS P melonis strain 502 had 99 % homology to 10 isolates of P melonis. California isolate CA-1103 differed from P. melonis strain 502 only by one pair of nucleotides. The homology percentage was also 99 % to the isolates from Texas (TX-1060 and TX-1065). Japan (CBS 489.96 and ACCC:39138), and Italy (Plect 211 and Plect 212). Spanish isolates (A-943, A-537, A-99) had a smaller percentage of homology - 98 %. The distribution of the disease for varieties Zhuravlionok, Konkurent, and Rodnichok was 50 %, and for varieties Nizhynsky 12 and Liosha - 60 and 80 %, respectively. The study on the varietal sensitivity to P melonis strain 502 demonstrated that varieties Konkurent (DSI - 1.3 +/- 0.0) and Rodnichok (DSI - 1.5 +/- 0.1) were referred to the group of highly resistant ones, Zhuravlionok (DSI - 2.6 +/- 0.3), Liosha (DSI - 2.2 +/- 0.2) and Nizhynskyi 12 (DSI - 2.5 +/- 0.2) - moderately resistant. The root collar was most severely diseased; it was of brown color. There were no above-ground symptoms. Additional roots above the damaged area were observed in cucumber plants of Zhuravlionok, Konkurent, and Rodnichok. Conclusions. The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that P. melonis strain 502 had 99 % homology with 10 isolates of P. melonis from the USA, Japan, and Italy. The percentage of homology with Spanish isolates, first isolated as the representatives of this genus, was lower (98 %). The root collar was damaged the most, which also indicated the similarity of symptoms to the American isolates compared to the ones from Spain, where the hypocotyl was damaged. There were no above-ground disease symptoms. The distribution of the disease and the degree of the damage were different depending on the variety. They did not depend on the maturity group, which demonstrated individual varietal sensitivity and the relevance of selecting resistant varieties as one of the main ways to control this disease agent. The study of the varietal sensitivity of C. sativus to P. melonis strain 502 showed that varieties Konkurent and Rodnichok could be referred to the highly resistant group, while Zhuravlionok, Liosha, and Nizhynskyi 12 - to moderately resistant ones. The distribution of the disease was also different depending on the variety (Zhuravlionok, Konkurent, and Rodnichok - 50 %, Nizhynsky 12 and Liosha - 60 and 80 %, respectively). Additional roots above the damaged area were observed in cucumber plants of varieties Zhuravlionok, Konkurent, and Rodnichok as a defensive response to being infected by the pathogen. No response of oversensitivity was registered in the investigated varieties of cucumber plants regarding P. melonis strain 502, which was conditioned by the stability of the environmental factors and absence of abiotic stressors for the plant, including moisture shortage and high temperatures.","Tsekhmister, HV; Kopilov, EP; Nadkernychna, OV; Kyslynska, AS",AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND PRACTICE,2022,10.15407/agrisp9.01.003,0.619982009792229,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.942922084840358,0.0570779151596421,0.999999888627279,1.11372720601466e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
9678,"Infection by a foliar endophyte elicits novel arabidopside-based plant defence reactions in its host, Cirsium arvense","Endophytic fungi live asymptomatically within plants. They are usually regarded as nonpathogenic or even mutualistic, but whether plants respond antagonistically to their presence remains unclear, particularly in the little-studied associations between endophytes and nongraminoid herbaceous plants. We investigated the effects of the endophyte Chaetomium cochlioides on leaf chemistry in Cirsium arvense. Plants were sprayed with spores; leaf material from both subsequent new growth and the sprayed leaves was analysed 2wk later. Infection frequency was 91% and 63% for sprayed and new growth, respectively, indicating that C.cochlioides rapidly infects new foliage. Metabolomic analyses revealed marked changes in leaf chemistry with infection, especially in new growth. Changes in several novel oxylipin metabolites were detected, including arabidopsides reported here for the first time in a plant species other than Arabidopsis thaliana, and a jasmonate-containing galactolipid. The production of these metabolites in response to endophyte presence, particularly in newly infected foliage, suggests that endophytes elicit similar chemical responses in plants to those usually produced following wounding, herbivory and pathogen invasion. Whether endophytes benefit their hosts may depend on a complex series of chemically mediated interactions between the plant, the endophyte, other microbial colonists and natural enemies.","Hartley, SE; Eschen, R; Horwood, JM; Gange, AC; Hill, EM",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,2015,10.1111/nph.13067,0.837565729192053,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.924679717062054,0.0753202829379458,0.999896693488532,1.0330651146783e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

However, this group of grass-loving fungi also accommodates soil saprobes, endophytes, mycoparasites and rare opportunistic pathogens of humans and other animals. Recent publications have highlighted the vast phylogenetic and biochemical diversity of the FSAMSC, although a large number of taxa in FSAMSC have not been systematically described and still lack Latin binomials. In this study we established the phylogenetic breadth of the FSAMSC using an integrative approach including morphological, multilocus phylogenetic, and coalescence analyses based on five gene regions (calmodulin, RNA polymerase II largest and second largest subunits, translation elongation factor 1-alpha, and beta-tubulin). Results obtained support the recognition of 75 taxa in FSAMSC, including all the currently known species segregates of the Fusarium head-blight pathogen F. graminearum s. lat. Thirty novel species are formally described and illustrated, while four phylogenetic species remain undescribed. An epitype is proposed for the generic type of Fusarium, F. sambucinum, from recently collected material identified by means of morphology, phylogenetics and mating experiments, fixing the phylogenetic application of the name.

On the basal crown area, the plants showed pale brown or yellow-orange, sunken lesions bordered by a reddish orange strip up to 1 mm wide. A water-soaked rot or white mycelium at the soil line was also observed. Thirty pieces (0.5 to 1 cm) from the edge of symptomatic tissues were surface disinfected for 2 min in 0.8% (wt/vol) NaOCl, washed with sterile distilled water (SDW), and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA). In addition, 20 pieces of affected tissue were ground in 400 μl of SDW (1:3, wt/wt), and the resulting suspensions were streaked by loops on PDA supplemented with 1.1 μl/ml of lactic acid (pH 4.4). A Fusarium sp. was consistently isolated from affected tissue pieces and streaks. Koch's postulates were performed at 25°C by inoculating 24 golden barrel cactus plants in 12-cm-diameter pots (12 plants previously sterile needle wounded) with 10 ml per plant of three suspensions (106 CFU/ml) of three isolates sprayed onto the basal stem. One milliliter per ten g of soil of each suspension was also added in the crown portion of golden barrel cacti. Twelve control cacti (six wounded) were sprayed only with SDW. Further pathogenicity tests were carried out on Thanksgiving cactus (Schlumbergera truncata (Haw.) Moran), devil's tongue barrel cactus (Ferocactus latispinus (Haw.) Britton & Rose), peruvian old man cactus (Espostoa lanata (Kunth) Britton & Rose), and Parodia spp. by inoculating eight plants for each host (four wounded) by placing 9-day-old 6-mm mycelial plugs at the base of the healthy cacti. An equal number of plants (four wounded) was inoculated only with a PDA plug. All cacti were maintained in polyethylene bags (90 to 95% for 72 hr) at 25°C. After 12 to 15 days, all wounded inoculated golden barrel, devil's tongue barrel, and peruvian old man cacti exhibited similar symptoms observed in the plastichouses. Typical symptoms were visible also in nonwounded and inoculated cacti 15 days later. Yellow-orange, tan, sunken, and roughly circular lesions were observed on the wounded and inoculated Thanksgiving and Parodia sp. cacti. Control plants were symptomless. The causal fungus was always reisolated from infected cacti. On the basis of 3-septate macroconidia (27 to 35 μm long × 3 to 4 μm wide [average 31.45 × 3.18 μm]), microconidia aseptate, single or double chlamydospores, and monophialide conidiophores observed on carnation leaf agar, and considering the susceptibility of all other inoculated hosts, the fungus was identified as F. oxysporum Schlechtend. f. sp. opuntiarum (Speg.)

8856,Non-systemic fungal endophytes in Carex brevicollis may influence the toxicity of the sedge to livestock,"The sedge Carex brevicollis is a common component of semi-natural grasslands and forests in temperate mountains of Central and Southern Europe. The consumption of this species causes a severe toxicity to livestock, associated to high plant concentrations of the beta-carbolic alkaloid brevicolline. This research was started to ascertain the origin of this toxicity. An exploratory survey of alkaloid content in plants growing in contrasting habitats (grasslands/forests) did not contribute to find a pattern of the variable contents of brevicolline in plants, and led us to address other possibilities, such as a potential role of fungal endophytism. Systemic, vertically-transmitted endophytes producers of herbivore-deterrent alkaloids are known to infect many known forage grasses. We did not detect systemic endophytes in C. brevicollis, but the sedge harboured a rich community of non-systemic fungi. To test experimentally whether non-systemic endophytes influenced the synthesis of the alkaloid, 24 plants were submitted to a fungicide treatment to remove the fungal assemblage, and the offspring ramets were analysed for alkaloid content. Brevicolline was the major beta-carbolic alkaloid detected, and the contents were at least five times lower in the new ramets that developed from fungicide-treated plants than in the untreated plants. This result, although not conclusive about the primary source of the alkaloid (a plant or a fungal product) indicates that fungal endophytes may affect the contents of the toxic brevicolline in this sedge.","Canals, RM; San-Emeterio, L; Sanchez-Marquez, S; de los Mozos, IR; Pujol, P; Zabalgogeazcoa, I",SPANISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,2014,10.5424/sjar/2014123-5219,0.855359314645263,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999781626652184,2.1837334781558e-4,0.999999640259349,3.59740651045826e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

We grew endophyte infected (E+) and endophyte free (E-) Lolium perenne, Hordeum brevisubulatum and Achnatherum inebrians for 18 months in field plots. In E+ soil of all three grasses, available phosphorus was lower whereas total soil nitrogen was higher. Endophyte effects on soil pH, microbial biomass nitrogen, total carbon and organic carbon as well as bacteria and fungi abundance were host species dependent. Ammonia oxidizing bacteria abundance was higher in E+ soils for all species. Bacterial community composition of E+ and E- soils were different only for Lolium perenne with soil pH being the key factor. Fungal community composition of E+ and E- soils was not different for the three grasses. This study confirmed that the effects of foliar Epichloe infection on belowground properties depended on host species identity.","Yang, ZH; Jin, YY; Hou, FJ; Bowatte, S",FUNGAL ECOLOGY,2021,10.1016/j.funeco.2021.101091,0.823230362636743,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999979361619792,2.06383802079883e-5,0.999999999999908,9.225953334635051e-14,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
8710,"Antibacterial secondary metabolites from an endophytic fungus, Fusarium solani JK10","Extensive chemical investigation of the endophytic fungus, Fusarium solani JK10, harbored in the root of the Ghanaian medicinal plant Chlorophora regia, using the OSMAC (One Strain Many Compounds) approach resulted in the isolation of seven new 7-desmethyl fusarin C derivatives (1-7), together with five known compounds (8-12). The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by analysis of their spectroscopic data including 1D, 2D NMR, HRESI-MSn and IR data. The relative configuration of compounds 1/2 was deduced by comparison of their experimental electronic circular dichroism (ECD) and optical rotation data with those reported in literature. The absolute configuration of solaniol (10), a known compound with undefined absolute stereo chemistry, was established for the first time by X-ray diffraction analysis of a single-crystal structure using Cu-K alpha radiation. The antibacterial activities of the crude fungal extract and the compounds isolated from the fungus were evaluated against some clinically important bacterial strains such as Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, as well as an environmental strain of Escherichia coil and the soil bacterium Acinetobacter sp. BD4. Compounds 3/4 and 6 exhibited antibacterial efficacies against the soil bacterium Acinetobacter sp., comparable to the reference standard streptomycin. All the tested compounds (1-9) demonstrated antibacterial activity against the environmental strain of E. coli, whereas no antibacterial activity was observed against S. aureus and B. subtilis. The antibacterial activity of the isolated compounds typically against E. coil and Acinetobacter sp. provides further insight into the possible involvement of root-borne endophytes in chemical defense of their host plants in selected ecological niches.","Kyekyeku, JO; Kusari, S; Adosraku, RK; Bullach, A; Golz, C; Strohmann, C; Spiteller, M",FITOTERAPIA,2017,10.1016/j.fitote.2017.04.007,0.946713451175869,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99910640740216,8.9359259784051e-4,0.999999285666218,7.14333781681731e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15433,Dominant remodelling of cattle rumen microbiome by Schedonorus arundinaceus (tall fescue) KY-31 carrying a fungal endophyte,"Tall fescue KY-31 is an important primary forage for beef cattle. It carries a fungal endophyte that produces ergovaline, the main cause of tall fescue toxicosis that leads to major revenue loss for livestock producers. The MaxQ, an engineered cultivar, hosts an ergovaline nonproducing strain of the fungus and consequently is nontoxic. However, it is less attractive economically. It is not known how rumen microbiome processes these two forages towards nutrient generation and ergovaline transformation. We have analysed the rumen microbiome compositions of cattle that grazed MaxQ with an intervening KY-31 grazing period using the 16S rRNA-V4 element as an identifier and found that KY-31 remodelled the microbiome substantially, encompassing both cellulolytic and saccharolytic functions. The effect was not evident at the whole microbiome levels but was identified by analysing the sessile and planktonic fractions separately. A move from MaxQ to KY-31 lowered the Firmicutes abundance in the sessile fraction and increased it in planktonic part and caused an opposite effect for Bacteroidetes, although the total abundances of these dominant rumen organisms remained unchanged. The abundances of Fibrobacter, which degrades less degradable fibres, and certain cellulolytic Firmicutes such as Pseudobutyrivibrio and Butyrivibrio 2, dropped in the sessile fraction, and these losses were apparently compensated by increased occurrences of Eubacterium and specific Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae. A return to MaxQ restored the original Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes distributions. However, several KY-31 induced changes, such as the low abundance of Fibrobacter and Butyrivibrio two remained in place, and their substitutes maintained significant presence. The rumen microbiome was distinct from previously reported faecal microbiomes. In summary, KY-31 and MaxQ were digested in the cattle rumen with distinct consortia and the KY-31-specific features were dominant. The study also identified candidate ergovaline transforming bacteria. It highlighted the importance of analysing sessile and plank-tonic fractions separately. © 2022 The Authors.",Khairunisa B.H.; Susanti D.; Loganathan U.; Teutsch C.D.; Campbell B.T.; Fiske D.; Wilkinson C.A.; Aylward F.O.; Mukhopadhyay B.,Access Microbiology,2022,10.1099/acmi.0.000322,0.969972308416424,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.867474109141533,0.132525890858467,0.999998474766858,1.5252331418969e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
15283,Some observations on meaningful and objective inference in radioecological field studies,"Anthropogenic releases of radiation are of ongoing importance for environmental protection, but the radiation doses at which natural systems begin to show effects are controversial. More certainty is required in this area to achieve optimal regulation for radioactive substances. We recently carried out a large survey (268 sampled animals and 20 sites) of the association between environmental radiation exposures and small mammal gut-associated microbiomes (fungal and bacterial) in the Chornobyl Exclusion zone (CEZ). Using individual measurements of total absorbed dose rates and a study design and analyses that accounted for spatial non-independence, we found no, or only limited, association. Watts et al. have criticised our study: for not filtering candidate non-resident components prior to our fungal microbiome analyses, for our qualified speculations on the relative merits of faecal and gut samples, and for the design of our study which they felt lacked sufficient replication. The advantage of filtering non-resident-fungal taxa is not clear and it would not have changed the null (spatially adjusted) association we found between radioactive dose and mycobiome composition because the most discriminatory fungal taxa with regard to dose were non-resident taxa. We maintain that it was legitimate for us to make qualified discussion comments on the differences in results between our faecal and gut microbiome analyses and on the relative merits of these sample types. Most importantly, the criticism of our study design by Watts et al. and the designs and analysis of their recent studies in the CEZ show a misunderstanding of the true nature of independent replication in field studies. Recognising the importance of spatial non-independence is essential in the design and analysis of radioecological field surveys. © 2022 The Authors.

15756,Screening of endophytic fungi against southern blight disease pathogen-Sclerotium delphinii in Dendrobium catenatum; [抗宿主白绢病的铁皮石斛内生真菌的筛选],"In order to screen the endophytic fungi that can enhance the host (Dendrobium catenatum) resistance to Sclerotium delphinii, the antagonism between each of the 43 endophytic fungi and the pathogen S. delphinii were tested. The results showed that 6 endophytic fungi (DCR2, DCR5, DCR21, DCR22, DCR42, DCR43) have strong activities against the pathogen, the inhibition rates were 49.2%, 49.2%, 47.2%, 56.2%, 53.2%, 48.0%, respectively. Then D. catenatum plantlets were inoculated with both S. delphinii and each of these six endophytic fungi. As a result, the incidence rates of leaves and stems of the D. catenatum plantlets inoculated with DCR2 and the pathogen were both significantly lower than those with other treatments, and the plantlet death rate was 0. It showed that DCR2 Trichoderma polysporum could effectively inhibit the southern blight disease of D. catenatum. Through the endophytic fungal re-isolation test, it was found that DCR2 can colonize in the roots, stems, and leaves of D. catenatum. The research will provide new ideas for the prevention and treatment of the southern blight disease of D. catenatum. It is also significant for reducing pesticide use, ensuring food safety, and promoting the sustainable development of D. catenatum industry. Furthermore, it will provide a basis for the disease control in other crops. © 2020, Editorial Board of China Journal of Chinese Materia Medica.

17331,Colonization and plant growth promoting characterization of endophytic Pseudomonas chlororaphis strain Zong1 isolated from Sophora alopecuroides root nodules.,"The endophytic strain Zong1 isolated from root nodules of the legume Sophora alopecuroides was characterized by conducting physiological and biochemical tests employing gfp-marking, observing their plant growth promoting characteristics (PGPC) and detecting plant growth parameters of inoculation assays under greenhouse conditions. Results showed that strain Zong1 had an effective growth at 28 ºC after placed at 4-60 ºC for 15 min, had a wide range pH tolerance of 6.0-11.0 and salt tolerance up to 5% of NaCl. Zong1 was resistant to the following antibiotics (μg/mL): Phosphonomycin (100), Penicillin (100) and Ampicillin (100). It could grow in the medium supplemented with 1.2 mmol/L Cu, 0.1% (w/v) methylene blue and 0.1-0.2% (w/v) methyl red, respectively. Zong1 is closely related to Pseudomonas chlororaphis based on analysis the sequence of 16S rRNA gene. Its expression of the gfp gene indicated that strain Zong1 may colonize in root or root nodules and verified by microscopic observation. Furthermore, co-inoculation with Zong1 and SQ1 (Mesorhizobium sp.) showed significant effects compared to single inoculation for the following PGPC parameters: siderophore production, phosphate solubilization, organic acid production, IAA production and antifungal activity in vitro. These results suggest strains P. chlororaphi Zong1 and Mesorhizobium sp. SQ1 have better synergistic or addictive effect. It was noteworthy that each growth index of co-inoculated Zong1+SQ1 in growth assays under greenhouse conditions is higher than those of single inoculation, and showed a significant difference (p < 0.05) when compared to a negative control.

2844,New Species of Didymellaceae within Aquatic Plants from Southwestern China,"Members of Didymellaceae have a wide geographical distribution throughout different ecosystems, and most species are associated with fruit, leaf, stem and root diseases of land plants. However, species that occur in aquatic plants are not clearly known. During a survey of the diversity of endophytes in aquatic plants in Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces, we obtained 51 isolates belonging to Didymellaceae based on internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) sequences. Further, the phylogenetic positions of these isolates were determined by combined sequences composed of ITS, partial large subunit nrRNA gene (28S nrDNA; LSU), RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (rpb2) and partial beta-tubulin gene (tub2). Combining morphological characteristics and multi-locus phylogenetic analyses, two new varieties belong to Boeremia and 12 new species distributed into seven genera were recognized from 51 isolates, i.e., Cumuliphoma, Didymella, Dimorphoma, Ectophoma, Leptosphaerulina, Remotididymella, and Stagonosporopsis. Among these species, only one species of Stagonosporopsis and two species of Leptosphaerulina show teleomorphic stages on OA, but have no anamorphic state. Each new species is described in detail, and the differences between new species and their phylogenetically related species are discussed here. The high frequency of new species indicates that aquatic plants may be a special ecological niche which highly promotes species differentiation. At the same time, the frequent occurrence of new species may indicate the need for extensive investigation of fungal resources in those aquatic environments where fungal diversity may be underestimated.","Chen, T; Wang, SY; Jiang, XW; Huang, Y; Mo, MH; Yu, ZF",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2023,10.3390/jof9070761,0.976347757226347,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.96743485450603,0.0325651454939704,0.999999996486672,3.5133278508681104e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) plants were inoculated with Bradyrhizobium japonicum and isolates of the VAM-fungal morphospecies Glomus mosseae (Nicol. and Gerd.) Gerd. and Trappe, collected from an arid (AR), semiarid (SA) or mesic (ME) area. Inoculum potentials of the VAM-fungal isolates were determined and the inocular equalized, achieving the same level of root colonization (41%, P > 0.05) at harvest (50 days). Plants of three VAM treatments (AR, SA and ME) were evaluated against non VAM controls. Significant differences in plant response to colonization were found in dry mass, leaf K, N and P concentrations, and in root/shoot, nodule/root, root length/leaf area and root length/root mass ratios. The differences were most pronouced and consistent between the AR and all other treatments. Photosynthesis and nodule activity were higher (P < 0.05) in all VAM treatments, but only the AR plants had higher (P<0.05) photosynthetic water-use efficiency than the controls. Nodule activity, evaluated by H2 evolution and C2H2 reduction, differed significantly between treatments. The results are discussed in terms of nutritional and non-nutritional effects of VAM colonization on the development and physiology of the tripartite soybean association in the light of intraspecific variability within the fungal endophyte.","BETHLENFALVAY, GJ; FRANSON, RL; BROWN, MS; MIHARA, KL",PHYSIOLOGIA PLANTARUM,1989,10.1111/j.1399-3054.1989.tb05637.x,0.926690847343229,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999996646191774,3.35380822584674e-6,1,1.11022302462516e-16,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

1150,How does the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum affect tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) rhizodeposition and soil microorganisms?,"The goal of our study was to investigate the impact of fungal endophytes in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) on rhizodeposition and in turn, the soil microbial community. Sand-based, aseptic microlysimeter units were constructed for the collection of rhizodeposit solutions for chemical analyses from the roots of endophyte-free (E-) and endophyte-infected (E+) tall fescue plants. E+ plants were infected with Neotyphodium coenophialum, the most common endophyte found in tall fescue. Rhizodeposit solutions collected over nine weeks from E+ grass contained more organic carbon and carbohydrates than E-. These solutions were allowed to percolate through columns of plant-free soils to assess the response of the soil microbial communities. Soils to which solutions from E+ grass were applied had significantly higher respiration rates than those receiving solutions from E- grass, suggesting that microbial activity was stimulated by changes in the rhizodeposits. Culture-based assays of the soil microbial community (plate counts and community-level physiological profiling) suggest that the basic structure of the microbial community was not affected by application of rhizodeposit solutions from E+ plants as compared to E-. Our results indicate that the presence of a fungal endophyte may enhance rhizodeposition by tall fescue and could consequently influence microbial mineralization processes in the soil. In grasslands where nutrients may be limiting, hosting a fungal endophyte has the potential to enhance plant nutrient supply indirectly via a stimulatory effect on the soil microbial biomass.","Van Hecke, MM; Treonis, AM; Kaufman, JR",PLANT AND SOIL,2005,10.1007/s11104-005-0380-2,0.898257443421859,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993763897006535,0.006236102993465,0.999998252254617,1.74774538275191e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10537,The locoweed endophyte Alternaria oxytropis affects root development in Arabidopsis in vitro through auxin signaling and polar transport,"Locoweeds are leguminous forbs known for their toxicity to livestock caused by the endophytic fungi Alternaria sect. Undifilum. Unlike the defensive mutualisms reported in many toxin-producing endophytes and their plant hosts, the benefits that A. sect. Undifilum can confer to it host plants remains unclear. Here, we conducted physiological and genetic analyses to show that A. (sect. Undifilum) oxytropis influences growth, especially root development, in its locoweed host Oxytropis ochrocephala and Arabidopsis. The presence of A. oxytropis significantly decreased primary root length while increasing the numbers of lateral roots and root hairs, and increasing plant leaf area and fresh weight. The fungus also increased the concentrations of plant endogenous auxin, and the expression of key genes for auxin biosynthesis, signaling, and transport. These effects on root development were abolished in mutants deficient in auxin signaling and polar transport. Alternaria oxytropis down-regulated expression of PIN1 but increased expression of PIN2, PIN7, and AUX1, which might reflect alterations in the spatial accumulation of auxin responsible for the changes in root architecture. Plant growth was insensitive to A. oxytropis when naphthylphthalamic acid was applied. Our findings indicate a function of A. oxytropis in promoting the growth and development of Arabidopsis via the regulation of auxin, which in turn suggests a possible role in benefiting its locoweed hosts via a process independent of its toxin production.","Guan, HR; Liu, X; Fu, YP; Han, XM; Wang, YL; Li, Q; Guo, L; Mur, LAJ; Wei, YH; He, W",JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,2023,10.1093/jxb/erac430,0.738904408364027,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.938814407905869,0.0611855920941306,0.999905078038913,9.49219610869578e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
20704,Evaluation of some fungal endophytes of plant potentiality as low-cost adsorbents for heavy metals uptake from aqueous solution,"Wastewaters resulted from different industries in Egypt such as food, painting, service, pharmaceuticals, water valves, packing materials and cartoons & inks industries which are drained on sewage waste and underground water contain different harmful concentrations of the most toxic heavy metals to humans and wildlife, copper and cadmium. This study aim to screen and apply endophytic fungal strains of plant grow in industrial regions that are capable of degrading and accumulate recalcitrant heavy metals to decrease the environmental loading, solve the problems of pollution and improve the quality of drinking and irrigated water in industrial regions. Ten endophytic fungi were isolated and screened for uptake experiments. All endophytic fungal strains under study showed cadmium and copper resistance with varying level. Among them, endophytic Penicillium lilacinum showed the highest removal for copper (85.4%) with good removal for cadmium heavy metal ions (31.43%). The Langmuir model was more able to describe the experimental equilibrium data for biosorption of Cd2+ and Cu2+ ions on fungal pellets under given experimental conditions than Freundlich isotherm model.

6523,Genomic and Metabolomic Analysis of the Endophytic Fungus Fusarium sp. VM-40 Isolated from the Medicinal Plant Vinca minor,"The genus Fusarium is well-known to comprise many pathogenic fungi that affect cereal crops worldwide, causing severe damage to agriculture and the economy. In this study, an endophytic fungus designated Fusarium sp. VM-40 was isolated from a healthy specimen of the traditional European medicinal plant Vinca minor. Our morphological characterization and phylogenetic analysis reveal that Fusarium sp. VM-40 is closely related to Fusarium paeoniae, belonging to the F. tricinctum species complex (FTSC), the genomic architecture and secondary metabolite profile of which have not been investigated. Thus, we sequenced the whole genome of Fusarium sp. VM-40 with the new Oxford Nanopore R10.4 flowcells. The assembled genome is 40 Mb in size with a GC content of 47.72%, 15 contigs (>= 50,000 bp; N 50 similar to 4.3 Mb), and 13,546 protein-coding genes, 691 of which are carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme)-encoding genes. We furthermore predicted a total of 56 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) with antiSMASH, 25 of which showed similarity with known BGCs. In addition, we explored the potential of this fungus to produce secondary metabolites through untargeted metabolomics. Our analyses reveal that this fungus produces structurally diverse secondary metabolites of potential pharmacological relevance (alkaloids, peptides, amides, terpenoids, and quinones). We also employed an epigenetic manipulation method to activate cryptic BGCs, which led to an increased abundance of several known compounds and the identification of several putative new compounds. Taken together, this study provides systematic research on the whole genome sequence, biosynthetic potential, and metabolome of the endophytic fungus Fusarium sp. VM-40.","He, T; Li, X; Iacovelli, R; Hackl, T; Haslinger, K",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2023,10.3390/jof9070704,0.973548585666248,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999965898277908,3.41017220917216e-5,0.999999999609534,3.90466325939087e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
8998,The Endophytic Fungus Piriformospora indica Reprograms Banana to Cold Resistance,"Banana (Musa spp.), one of the most important fruits worldwide, is generally cold sensitive. In this study, by using the cold-sensitive banana variety Tianbaojiao (Musa acuminate) as the study material, we investigated the effects of Piriformospora indica on banana cold resistance. Seedlings with and without fungus colonization were subjected to 4 degrees C cold treatment. The changes in plant phenotypes, some physiological and biochemical parameters, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and the expression of eight cold-responsive genes in banana leaves before and after cold treatment were measured. Results demonstrated that P. indica colonization reduced the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) but increased the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) and the contents of soluble sugar (SS) and proline. Noteworthily, the CAT activity and SS content in the leaves of P. indica-colonized banana were significant (p < 0.05). After 24 h cold treatment, the decline in maximum photochemistry efficiency of photosystem II (F-v/F-m), photochemical quenching coefficient (qP), efficient quantum yield [Y(II)], and photosynthetic electron transport rate (ETR) in the leaves of P. indica-colonized banana was found to be lower than in the non-inoculated controls (p < 0.05). Moreover, although the difference was not significant, P. indica colonization increased the photochemical conversion efficiency and electron transport rate and alleviated the damage to the photosynthetic reaction center of banana leaves under cold treatment to some extent. Additionally, the expression of the most cold-responsive genes in banana leaves was significantly induced by P. indica during cold stress (p < 0.05). It was concluded that P. indica confers banana with enhanced cold resistance by stimulating antioxidant capacity, SS accumulation, and the expression of cold-responsive genes in leaves. The results obtained from this study are helpful for understanding the P. indica-induced cold resistance in banana.","Li, D; Bodjrenou, DM; Zhang, ST; Wang, B; Pan, H; Yeh, KW; Lai, ZX; Cheng, CZ",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES,2021,10.3390/ijms22094973,0.985733162067291,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999905302654172,9.46973458283389e-5,0.999999999874447,1.25552568341902e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19123,Mediterranean pine forest decline: A matter of root-associated microbiota and climate change.,"Forest ecosystems worldwide currently face worrying episodes of forest decline, which have boosted weakening and mortality of the trees. In the Mediterranean region, especially in the southeast Iberian Peninsula, Pinus sylvestris forests are severely affected by this phenomenon, and it has been commonly attributed to drought events. Remarkably, the role of root microbiota on pine decline has been overlooked and remains unclear. We therefore used metabarcoding to identify the belowground microbial communities of decline-affected and unaffected pine trees. Taxonomic composition of bacterial and fungal rhizosphere communities, and fungal populations dwelling in root endosphere showed different profiles depending on the health status of the trees. The root endosphere of asymptomatic trees was as strongly dominated by 'Candidatus Phytoplasma pini' as the root of decline-affected pines, accounting for >99 % of the total bacterial sequences in some samples. Notwithstanding, the titer of this phytopathogen was four-fold higher in symptomatic trees than in symptomless ones. Furthermore, the microbiota inhabiting the root endosphere of decline-affected trees assembled into a less complex and more modularized network. Thus, the observed changes in the microbial communities could be a cause or a consequence of forest decline phenomenon. Moreover, 'Ca. Phytoplasma pini' is positively correlated to Pinus sylvestris decline events, either as the primary cause of pine decline or as an opportunistic pathogen exacerbating the process once the tree has been weaken by other factors.",Lasa AV; Fernández-González AJ; Villadas PJ; Mercado-Blanco J; Pérez-Luque AJ; Fernández-López M,The Science of the total environment,2024,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.171858,0.956496871262167,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.981018105646023,0.0189818943539773,0.999998989808033,1.01019196663277e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5119,Diversity of endophytic enterobacteria associated with different host plants,"Fifty-three endophytic enterobacteria isolates from citrus, cocoa, eucalyptus, soybean, and sugar cane were evaluated for susceptibility to the antibiotics ampicillin and kanamycin, and cellulase production. Susceptibility was found on both tested antibiotics. However, in the case of ampicillin susceptibility changed according to the host plant, while all isolates were susceptible to kanamycin. Cellulase production also changed according to host plants. The diversity of these. isolates was estimated by employing BOX-PCR genomic fingerprints and 16S rDNA sequencing. In total, twenty-three distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified by employing a criterion of 60% fingerprint similarity as a surrogate for an OTU. The 23 OTUs belong to the Pantoea and Enterobacter genera, while their high diversity could be an indication of paraphyletic classification. Isolates representing nine different OTUs belong to Pantoea agglomerans, P. ananatis, P, stewartii, Enterobacter sp., and E. homaechei. The results of this study suggest that plant species may select endophytic bacterial genotypes. It has also become apparent that a review of the Pantoea/Enterobacter genera may be necessary.","Torres, AR; Araújo, WL; Cursino, L; Hungria, M; Plotegher, F; Mostasso, FL; Azevedo, JL",JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY,2008,10.1007/s12275-007-0165-9,0.860186268977339,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998069619265836,0.00193038073416394,0.999999999934564,6.543643404910429e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
8600,Composition and Diversity of the Culturable Endophytic Community of Six Stress-Tolerant Dessert Plants Grown in Stressful Soil in a Hot Dry Desert Region,"Saudi Arabia is part of a hot dry desert region and is characterized by stressful conditions. The main goal of this research was to identify endophytic fungal (EF) community composition, diversity and abundance in relation to their plant hosts and soil stress. The above-ground parts of six wild plants (Haloxylon salicornicum, Salsola kali, Heliotropium bacciferum, Erica verticillata, Salsola imbricata and Bienertia sinuspersici) were sampled, surface-sterilized and cut into small pieces, which were cultured and incubated for 4-6 weeks. Isolates were grouped and identified by using both morphological and ITS rDNA molecular data. The diversity and community structure of plant-endophyte associations were studied. A total of 455 EF isolates were grouped into 25 different taxa; 21 of which were identified at the species level, 2 at genus level and 2 were unclassified fungi. Here, 95.65% of the identified genera were Ascomycota; of which 36.36, 31.81 and 31.81% were members of the classes Dothideomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes, respectively. S. imbricata showed the highest isolation rate and colonization frequency (CF%) of EF when compared to other plant species. Additionally, S. imbricata demonstrated the highest species richness and species diversity of the EF community predominated by the genus Fusarium. Conclusively, the core culturable EF genera of six wild plants were identified (unculturable taxa were not identified in this study). The composition of the EF community was revealed to have a strong correlation to both the electrical conductivity and pH of the soil and a moderate correlation to both the host species and the host family. The abundance and diversity of EF communities of the six plants were environment-dependent.","AlSharari, SS; Galal, FH; Seufi, AM",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2022,10.3390/jof8030241,0.987635954988714,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.949360135673208,0.0506398643267923,0.999999841032682,1.58967318086845e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Endophytes were screened for diversity in tissue types, plant growth promoting (PGP) traits and downy mildew disease suppression ability in pearl millet. A total of 202 fungal isolates were isolated from leaves, shoot and root regions. The diversity analysis revealed that the plant harbored diverse fungal groups and the dominant fungi varied according to the sampling regions. The isolates were assigned to 29 fungal species based on morphology and molecular characterization using ITS sequence. All the isolates belonged to the phylum Ascomycota. Fusarium species were the most dominant fungi. Out of 29 representative isolates tested for plant growth promoting traits in vitro and in vivo, seven isolates were observed to improve the growth of pearl millet in comparison to control. Among the seven isolates, Fusarium oxysporum, Trichoderma asperellum and Acremonium sp. were found to suppress the downy mildew disease incidence by 36% in greenhouse conditions. The potent isolates were confirmed to behave as endophytes using pathogenicity, SEM and confocal microscopy experiments.

804,Influence of fungal endophyte infection on nutrient element content of tall fescue,"Fungal endophytes infect several grass species. The fungus can alter the growth, and physiological and morphological characteristics of the infected plant. A greenhouse experiment was designed to determine the effect of the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum on the nutrient element content of a selected ecotype of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea), when growing at two nutrient element supply levels. Stem dry matter, averaged over all harvests and nutrient element supply treatments, was higher in nea-infected (E-) than in endophyte infected (E+) plants. We found a significant interaction between endophyte infection and nutrient element supply level and/or harvest date on the nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) plant tissue concentrations. Only for Ca leaf concentrations the effect of infection status was not influenced by harvest date or nutrient element supply treatment and Ca concentration was higher in E- than in E+ plants. Differences between E+ and E- plants in P concentration were significant at the beginning of the experiment, and for N and Mg were observed at the end of the experiment (16 to 18 weeks). Endophyte-infected plants had higher stem N and leaf Mg concentrations in the high nutrient element supply, but significantly lower concentrations at the low nutrient element supply treatment. Phosphorus concentration in leaf and aboveground plant tissue was significantly higher in E- than in E+ plants at the high nutrient element fertility treatment at week 12, but in the low fertility treatment differences were not significant. Differences in potassium (K), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) concentration between infected and non-infected plants were not statistically significant. Our results suggest that endophyte infection of tall fescue appears to increase the content of nutrient elements related to protein synthesis processes (N and Mg).","Vázquez-de-Aldana, BR; García-Criado, B; Zabalgogeazcoa, I; García-Ciudad, A",JOURNAL OF PLANT NUTRITION,1999,10.1080/01904169909365615,0.992960656561045,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997872661223147,0.00212733877685297,0.999999999908929,9.107115062079169e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
7620,Bioactive secondary metabolites produced by an endophytic fungus Gaeumannomyces sp JS0464 from a maritime halophyte Phragmites communis,"Endophytes, important plant-associated mycobionts, have attracted a great deal of attention because of their bioactive secondary metabolites. Even though halophytes have been reported to overcome salt stress via associations with their endophytes, few studies have investigated the metabolites produced by the endophytes from halophytes. In this study, a dark septate endophytic fungal strain (JS0464), identified as Gaeumannomyces sp. by ITS sequencing, was isolated from the rhizome of a halophyte, Phragmites communis, in Suncheon bay, South Korea. This strain was cultured on a large scale and extracted with ethyl acetate. Chemical investigations of extracts of JS0464 led to the isolation of two glycosylated dialkylresorcinol derivatives (1-2), an anthraquinone derivative (3) and eight known compounds (4-11), which were identified by spectroscopic analyses incorporating one-dimensional/2D NMR and MS. Nine compounds showed significant nitric oxide reduction activity in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated microglia BV-2 cells, seven of which did not impair cell viability.

2497,Plant geographic origin and phylogeny as potential drivers of community structure in root-inhabiting fungi,"Root-inhabiting fungal communities, including mutualists and antagonists, influence host plant performance, and can potentially shape plant community composition. However, there is uncertainty about how root-inhabiting fungal communities are structured, and if fungal community characteristics are significant predictors of host plant abundance. In this study, we first assessed how root-inhabiting fungal communities were structured in relation to the phylogeny and geographic origins (native vs. exotic) of their host plants in an old-field community. In addition, we took into consideration the spatial arrangements (i.e. physical locations) of the individual host plants. We then tested if the relative abundances of pathogenic and beneficial arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi could predict host plant abundances. We found that host plant phylogeny was an important factor in structuring the whole fungal community, irrespective of host plant origin. Furthermore, the spatial arrangements of individual host plants were a strong predictor of AM fungal community structure. Host plant phylogeny and spatial arrangements appeared to similarly affect the structure of pathogenic fungal communities. No distinct differences were observed between native and exotic plant species in fungal community characteristics. The relative abundances of AM and pathogenic fungi were not significant predictors for observed abundances of their host plants. Synthesis. Host plant phylogeny and spatial arrangements can structure naturally occurring root-inhabiting fungal communities. The absence of distinct differences in fungal community composition, including pathogens, in exotic and native plants suggests long residence times and the consequent naturalization of exotic species in the region, allowing for the establishment of similar plant-microbial interactions between native and exotic species.","Koyama, A; Maherali, H; Antunes, PM",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2019,10.1111/1365-2745.13143,0.773439742328362,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991709727408701,0.00829027259129898,0.999999999293107,7.06892766544343e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

9447,"Boosting the Anticancer Activity of Aspergillus flavus ""endophyte of Jojoba""Taxol via Conjugation with Gold Nanoparticles Mediated by γ-drradiation","Taxol production by fungi is one of the promising alternative approaches, regarding to the natural and semisynthetic sources; however, the lower yield and rapid loss of Taxol productivity by fungi are the major challenges that halt their further industrial implementation. Thus, searching for fungal isolates with affordable Taxol-production stability, in addition to enhance its anticancer activity via conjugation with gold nanoparticles, is the main objectives of this study. Twenty-four endophytic fungal isolates were recovered from the barks, twigs, and leaves of jojoba plant, among these fungi, Aspergillus flavus MW485934.1 was the most potent Taxol producer (88.6 mu g/l). The chemical identity of the extracted Taxol of A. flavus was verified by the TLC, HPLC, HNMR, and FTIR analyses. The yield of Taxol produced by A. flavus was optimized by the response surface methodology (RSM) using Plackett-Burman (PBD) and faced central composite designs (FCCD). The yield of Taxol by A. flavus was increased by about 3.2 folds comparing to the control cultures (from 96.5 into 302.7 mu g/l). The highest Taxol yield by was obtained growing A. flavus on a modified malt extract medium (g/l) (malt extract 20.0, peptone 2.0, sucrose 20.0, soytone 2.0, cysteine 0.5, glutamine 0.5, and beef extract 1.0 adjusted to pH 6.0) and incubated at 30 degrees C for 16 days. From the FCCD design, the significant variables affecting Taxol production by A. flavus were cysteine, pH, and incubation time. Upon A. flavus gamma-irradiation at 1.0 kGy, the Taxol yield was increased by about 1.25 fold (375.9 mu g/l). To boost its anticancer activity, the purified Taxol was conjugated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) mediated by gamma-rays irradiation (0.5 kGy), and the physicochemical properties of Taxol-AuNPs composite were evaluated by UV-Vis, DLS, XRD, and TEM analyses. The IC50 values of the native-Taxol and Taxol-AuNPs conjugates towards HEPG-2 cells were 4.06 and 2.1 mu g/ml, while the IC50 values against MCF-7 were 6.07 and 3.3 mu g/ml, respectively. Thus, the anticancer activity of Taxol-AuNPs composite was increased by 2 folds comparing to the native Taxol towards HEPG-2 and MCF-7 cell lines. Also, the antimicrobial activity of Taxol against the multidrug resistant bacteria was dramatically increased upon conjugation with AuNPs comparing to authentic AuNPs and Taxol, ensuring the higher solubility, targetability, and efficiency of Taxol upon AuNPs conjugation.","Abdel-Fatah, SS; El-Sherbiny, GM; Khalaf, M; El Baz, AF; El-Sayed, ASA; El-Batal, A",APPLIED BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,2022,10.1007/s12010-022-03906-8,0.966102909840817,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.987060583697134,0.0129394163028662,0.999998853202135,1.14679786455962e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
9377,Endophytic Fusarium oxysporum GW controlling weed and an effective biostimulant for wheat growth,"Wheat crop has to compete with several weeds including Avena fatua, a noxious weed that alone is responsible for 30-70% losses in the yield annually. Because of the environmental concerns associated with conventional methods, researchers are on a continuous hunt to find clean alternatives in order to manage weeds. Fungi have shown promising weedicide potential in lab studies. The current study aimed to isolate endophytic fungi from wheat plants which can promote wheat growth and inhibit the growth of common weed, A. fatua. Of several isolates, GW (grayish white) was selected for its promising features, and the strain was identified as Fusarium oxisporum through ITS sequencing technique. This fungus released a number of compounds including Isovitexin, Calycosin, quercetagetin, and dihydroxy-dimethoxyisoflavone that inhibited the growth of A. fatua but did not influence the growth of wheat seedlings. Biomass of this fungus in the soil also reduced growth parameters of the weed and promoted the growth of wheat. For instance, the vigor index of A. fatua seedlings was reduced to only 6% of the control by this endophyte. In contrast, endophyte-associated wheat seedlings showed a higher vigor index than the control. Behind this differential response of the two plants were their contrasting physiological and biochemical status. Lower growth phenotypes of A. fatua seedlings had reduced levels of IAA, GAs, and SA and higher the levels of JA and ABA. Besides, their ROS scavenging ability was also compromised as evident from relatively lower activities of catalase, peroxidase, and ascorbic acid oxidase, as well as higher accumulation of ROS in their leaves. Wheat seedlings response to GW was opposite to the A. fatua. It may be concluded that F. oxysporum GW has the ability to differentially modulate physiology and biochemistry of the two hosts leading to contrasting phenotypic responses.","Asim, S; Hussain, A; Murad, W; Hamayun, M; Iqbal, A; Rehman, H; Tawab, A; Irshad, M; Alataway, A; Dewidar, AZ; Elansary, HO; Lee, IJ",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2022,10.3389/fpls.2022.922343,0.869677596093346,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.925749164013761,0.0742508359862394,0.999999263027188,7.36972811554715e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19356,"Comparative genomic analysis and proposal of Clostridium yunnanense sp. nov., Clostridium rhizosphaerae sp. nov., and Clostridium paridis sp. nov., three novel Clostridium sensu stricto endophytes with diverse capabilities of acetic acid and ethanol production.","Genus Clostridium sensu stricto is generally regarded as the true Clostridium genus, which includes important human and animal pathogens and industrially relevant microorganisms. Besides, it is also a prominent member of plant-associated endophytes. However, our knowledge of endophytic Clostridium is limited. In this study, the endophytes were isolated under anaerobic condition from the roots of Paris polyphylla Smith var. yunnanensis. Subsequently, a polyphasic taxonomic approach was used to clarify their taxonomic positions. The fermentation products were measured in the isolates with HPLC analysis. Comparative genomics was performed on these new strains and other relatives. In total, nine endophytic strains belonging to the genus Clostridium sensu stricto were isolated, and three of them were identified as new species. Seven of nine strains could produce acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Only two strains could produce ethanol, although genomics analysis suggested that only two of them were without genes for solventogenesis. Different from the endophytic strains, the phylogenetically closely related non-endophytic strains showed significant enrichment effects on some metabolic pathways involving environmental information processing, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolisms, etc. It suggests that the genomes of these endophytic strains had undergone subtle changes associated with environmental adaptations. Consequently, strains YIM B02505T, YIM B02515T, and YIM B02565T are proposed to represent a new species of the genus Clostridium sensu stricto, for which the names Clostridium yunnanense sp. nov., Clostridium rhizosphaerae sp. nov., and Clostridium paridis sp. nov. are suggested.",Li CJ; Zhang Z; Zhan PC; Lv AP; Li PP; Liu L; Li WJ; Yang LL; Zhi XY,Anaerobe,2023,10.1016/j.anaerobe.2022.102686,0.945483516348658,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994705961543322,0.00529403845667773,0.999987939327842,1.20606721576433e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

12904,Involvement of auxin pathways in modulating root architecture during beneficial plant-microorganism interactions,"The community of researchers studying molecular plant-microbe interactions under the banners of fundamental plant science, biofuel-bioenergy, and crop productivity and sustainability research is expanding rapidly. The review summarizes multiple, separate lines of evidences linking auxin transport, signaling, and synthesis pathways to beneficial plant-microbe interactions and modulations in host root architecture. Compelling physiology and functional genomics-based evidence was found in support of a delicate and precise orchestration of distinct root phenotypic effects achieved via a shared auxin biosynthesis and signaling machinery involving signaling crosstalk. A hypothetical and simplified model on role of auxin in beneficial plant-microbe interactions is presented, and outstanding research challenges and potential future directions are discussed. A wide variety of microorganisms known to produce auxin and auxin precursors form beneficial relationships with plants and alter host root development. Moreover, other signals produced by microorganisms affect auxin pathways in host plants. However, the precise role of auxin and auxin-signalling pathways in modulating plant-microbe interactions is unknown. Dissecting out the auxin synthesis, transport and signalling pathways resulting in the characteristic molecular, physiological and developmental response in plants will further illuminate upon how these intriguing inter-species interactions of environmental, ecological and economic significance occur. The present review seeks to survey and summarize the scattered evidence in support of known host root modifications brought about by beneficial microorganisms and implicate the role of auxin synthesis, transport and signal transduction in modulating beneficial effects in plants. Finally, through a synthesis of the current body of work, we present outstanding challenges and potential future research directions on studies related to auxin signalling in plant-microbe interactions. © 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Sukumar P.; Legué V.; Vayssières A.; Martin F.; Tuskan G.A.; Kalluri U.C.,"Plant, Cell and Environment",2013,10.1111/pce.12036,0.865664602881788,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.965156797702643,0.0348432022973572,0.999990513008509,9.48699149094789e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12386,A 2-kb Mycovirus Converts a Pathogenic Fungus into a Beneficial Endophyte for Brassica Protection and Yield Enhancement,"Mycoviruses are viruses that infect fungi, and hypovirulence-associated mycoviruses have the potential to control fungal diseases. However, it is unclear how mycovirus-mediated hypovirulent strains live and survive in the field, and no mycovirus has been applied for field crop protection. In this study, we found that a previously identified small DNA mycovirus (SsHADV-1) can convert its host, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, from a typical necrotrophic pathogen to a beneficial endophytic fungus. SsHADV-1 downregulates the expression of key pathogenicity factor genes in S. sclerotiorum during infection. When growing in rapeseed, the SsHADV-1-infected strain DT-8 significantly regulates the expression of rapeseed genes involved in defense, hormone signaling, and circadian rhythm pathways. As a result, plant growth is promoted and disease resistance is enhanced. Field experiments showed that spraying DT-8 at the early flowering stage can reduce the disease severity of rapeseed stem rot by 67.6% and improve yield by 14.9%. Moreover, we discovered that SsHADV-1 could also infect other S. sclerotiorum strains on DT-8-inoculated plants and that DT-8 could be recovered from dead plants. These findings suggest that the mycoviruses may have the ability to shape the origin of endophytism. Our discoveries suggest that mycoviruses may influence the origin of endophytism and may also offer a novel strategy for disease control in which mycovirus-infected strains are used to improve crop health and release mycoviruses into the field.","Zhang, HX; Xie, JT; Fu, YP; Cheng, JS; Qu, Z; Zhao, ZZ; Cheng, SF; Chen, T; Li, B; Wang, QQ; Liu, XQ; Tian, BN; Collinge, DB; Jiang, DH",MOLECULAR PLANT,2020,10.1016/j.molp.2020.08.016,0.69528654151789,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.898128031754047,0.101871968245953,0.99999937058488,6.29415119912657e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
3978,"Deciphering the evolutionary and taxonomic complexity of Diaporthales (Sordariomycetes, Ascomycota) through integrated phylogenomic and divergence time estimation","Diaporthales is an important group of fungi widely distributed worldwide as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes on the various plants. Here, we collected and isolated 209 strains of the Diaporthales and then employed morphological characteristics and advanced techniques such as multigene phylogenetics, genomic phylogenetics, molecular clock estimates, and metabolic pathways annotations to explore the evolutionary diversification and metabolic pathways within the Diaporthales. Firstly, our study confirmed that Diaporthales occurred early with a mean stem age of 181.5 Mya and a mean crown age of 157.7 Mya. Secondly, two new families, Sinodisculaceae fam. nov. and Ternstroemiomycetaceae fam. nov., were introduced based on morphology, phylogeny, and divergence times. Thirdly, we further described multiple novel taxa or records including Anadiaporthostoma gen. nov. (Diaporthostomataceae), Lunatospora gen. nov. (Sinodisculaceae), Microphaeotubakia gen. nov. (Tubakiaceae), Neoplagiostoma gen. nov. (Pseudoplagiostomataceae), and Ternstroemiomyces gen. nov. (Ternstroemiomycetaceae), 55 new species, three new species complexes, 32 new host records, and three new combinations. Furthermore, we accepted 35 families within the Diaporthales based on analysis of multiple evidences. Additionally, high activity in universal pathways such as purine metabolism and ribosome across the order suggested a fundamental for robust growth and stress response in Diaporthales. These findings enrich fungal biodiversity and provide critical insights into the evolutionary processes in these communities.","Zhang, ZX; Shang, YX; Liu, QY; Li, DH; Yin, CZ; Liu, XY; Tao, MF; Jiang, Y; Wang, YX; Zhang, MY; Dong, ZX; Yun, JX; Xia, JW; Wang, S; Li, Z; Luo, ZL; Liu, XY; Zhang, XG",FUNGAL DIVERSITY,2025,10.1007/s13225-025-00551-4,0.953585904209429,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998551976355523,0.00144802364447749,0.999954142884462,4.58571155379506e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12618,Mechanisms by which fungicides increase grain sink capacity and yield of spring barley when visible disease severity is low or absent,"Fungicides are a central component of disease management programmes in many cereal production systems worldwide, but intensive use has led to problems with the evolution of resistance in pathogen populations, harmful effects on non-target organisms and residues in the food chain and environment. Better targeting of fungicide applications, according to the likely response of the crop, would help improve the sustainability of disease management, but decision making is hindered by our poor understanding of the mechanisms by which fungicides influence crop yield. This study investigated possible mechanisms responsible for yield increases following fungicide treatment of spring barley with little or no visible disease. Field experiments conducted over six site-years in the UK quantified the effects of the protectant fungicide chlorothalonil (Chl), and systemic fungicides prothioconazole (Pro) and pyraclostrobin (Pyr), applied on their own or in combination. The severity of visible disease in the absence of fungicide treatments was minimised by growing varieties with good disease resistance. Contrasting fungicide chemistries led to different effects on yield. There were two components to the yield increases. The first involved an increase (4.3-7.5 %) in grain number m(-2) and was elicited by Pro and Pyr, but not Chl. The second was a smaller increase (3.7-4.6%) in mean grain weight (MGW) and was elicited by each of the fungicides tested. The effect of the triazole (Pro) and strobilurin (Pyr) on grain number was not the result of the control of visible disease pre-anthesis or an increase in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) interception. Nor was it the result of the control of asymptomatic pathogen infection or possibly leaf surface saprophytes, because Chl gave equivalent control without increasing grain number. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that triazoles and strobilurins can increase grain sink capacity through direct physiological effects in the field. These apparent physiological effects differ from those reported for wheat as they occur pre-anthesis and are not associated with delayed leaf senescence and resulting increased PAR interception. Application of Pro + Pyr increased radiation use efficiency (RUE), estimated over the whole season, by around 10 % compared to untreated controls and 6 % compared to Chl treated crops. Evidence is presented to show that whilst the average yield response to Pro + Pyr in the absence of disease was around 3 %, the response varied widely between sites and years. Where effects on grain number do occur, they can be elicited in a range of varieties by a single application made at booting. We argue that benefiting from physiological effects of triazole and strobilurin fungicides on spring barley yield, through appropriate timing of application, is compatible with strategies to target and reduce fungicide use in this crop.","Bingham, IJ; Young, C; Bounds, P; Gravouil, C; Paveley, ND",FIELD CROPS RESEARCH,2021,10.1016/j.fer.2020.108011,0.992572325701568,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.90287704266289,0.0971229573371098,0.999971649007573,2.83509924274838e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
8204,The endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica stimulates the expression of nitrate reductase and the starch-degrading enzyme glucan-water dikinase in tobacco and Arabidopsis roots through a homeodomain transcription factor that binds to a conserved motif in their promoters,"Piriformospora indica, an endophytic fungus of the Sebacinaceae family, promotes growth of Arabidopsis and tobacco seedlings and stimulates nitrogen accumulation and the expression of the genes for nitrate reductase and the starch-degrading enzyme glucan-water dikinase (SEX1) in roots. Neither growth promotion nor stimulation of the two enzymes requires heterotrimeric G proteins. P. indica also stimulates the expression of the uidA gene under the control of the Arabidopsis nitrate reductase (Nia2) promoter in transgenic tobacco seedlings. At least two regions (-470/-439 and -103/-89) are important for Nia2 promoter activity in tobacco roots. One of the regions contains an element, ATGATAGATAAT, that binds to a homeodomain transcription factor in vitro. The message for this transcription factor is up-regulated by P. indica. The transcription factor also binds to a CTGATAGATCT segment in the SEX1 promoter in vitro. We propose that the growth-promoting effect initiated by P. indica is accompanied by a co-regulated stimulation of enzymes involved in nitrate and starch metabolisms.","Sherameti, I; Shahollari, B; Venus, Y; Altschmied, L; Varma, A; Oelmüller, R",JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY,2005,10.1074/jbc.M500447200,0.905858401046628,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999395392955828,6.046070441721e-4,0.999999999994272,5.72775160634365e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15630,Ecological Relevance of the Endophytic Fungal Diversity in Velamen Roots of Tropical Epiphytic Orchids,"The velamen roots in epiphytic orchids are rather complex, and their environmental role remains poorly understood. Fungal associates are known in the velamen roots of tropical orchids, but the magnitude of their diversity in particular species remains unknown. The primary aim of this work was to explore endophytic fungal species associated with the velamen roots of three tropical epiphytic orchids. Velamen roots were collected from 30 plants of Rhynchostylis retusa and 25 plants each of Epidendrum radicans and Oncidium sphacelatum. Endophytic fungi were isolated from 2160 segments. Twenty species of velamen-root-associated fungal endophytes were separated with a culture technique. The isolated strains were grouped into morphotypes, subsequently identified morphologically and by means of ITS DNA barcoding. Ascomycota were the dominant group with 18 species. Trichoderma cf. asperellum, Endomelanconiopsis endophytica, Trichoderma cf. atroviride and Lasiodiplodia theobromae were the most frequent taxa isolated. A majority of the identified fungi were common to more than one orchid. Colonisation rate, isolation rate, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, species richness and species evenness of the endophytic fungi from different orchids were studied and were tested for significance with the Kruskal-Wallis H test. The colonisation rate and isolation rate of fungal associates in the velamen roots were found to be distinctly the lowest in Rhynchostylis retusa. © 2021.

18595,The genome and genetics of a high oxidative stress tolerant Serratia sp. LCN16 isolated from the plant parasitic nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus.,"Pine wilt disease (PWD) is a worldwide threat to pine forests, and is caused by the pine wood nematode (PWN) Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. Bacteria are known to be associated with PWN and may have an important role in PWD. Serratia sp. LCN16 is a PWN-associated bacterium, highly resistant to oxidative stress in vitro, and which beneficially contributes to the PWN survival under these conditions. Oxidative stress is generated as a part of the basal defense mechanism used by plants to combat pathogenic invasion. Here, we studied the biology of Serratia sp. LCN16 through genome analyses, and further investigated, using reverse genetics, the role of two genes directly involved in the neutralization of H2O2, namely the H2O2 transcriptional factor oxyR; and the H2O2-targeting enzyme, catalase katA. Serratia sp. LCN16 is phylogenetically most closely related to the phytosphere group of Serratia, which includes S. proteamaculans, S. grimessi and S. liquefaciens. Likewise, Serratia sp. LCN16 shares many features with endophytes (plant-associated bacteria), such as genes coding for plant polymer degrading enzymes, iron uptake/transport, siderophore and phytohormone synthesis, aromatic compound degradation and detoxification enzymes. OxyR and KatA are directly involved in the high tolerance to H2O2 of Serratia sp. LCN16. Under oxidative stress, Serratia sp. LCN16 expresses katA independently of OxyR in contrast with katG which is under positive regulation of OxyR. Serratia sp. LCN16 mutants for oxyR (oxyR::int(614)) and katA (katA::int(808)) were sensitive to H2O2 in relation with wild-type, and both failed to protect the PWN from H2O2-stress exposure. Moreover, both mutants showed different phenotypes in terms of biofilm production and swimming/swarming behaviors.

5193,Ectopic growth of the Chaetothyriales fungal symbiont on Ipomoea carnea,"Swainsonine, an indolizidine alkaloid, is an a -mannosidase and mannosidase II inhibitor that alters glycoprotein processing and causes lysosomal storage disease. Swainsonine is the toxic principle in several plant species worldwide and causes severe toxicosis in livestock grazing these plants. All swainsonine-containing plant taxa investigated to date are associated with fungal symbionts that produce swainsonine. Among the swainsonine-containing convolvulaceous species, Ipomoea carnea Jacq. is associated with a seed-transmitted symbiont belonging to the fungal order Chaetothyriales. The nature of this association was unclear; therefore, this association was investigated further using microscopy. Macroscopic and microscopic data reported here demonstrate that the Chaetothyriales symbiont associated with I. carnea grows ectopically on the adaxial (upper) surface of leaves as lacy mycelia in plants that contain swainsonine and was not present on plants lacking swainsonine that were derived from fungicide-treated seeds. Hyphae were not observed on the surface of any other tissues including the abaxial (lower) leaf surface, petiole, and stem.

15190,Changes in the Structure of Soil Microscopic Fungi in the Territories of Yavoriv and Podorozhenie Sulfur Quarries,"The article presents the results of monitoring the soil mycobiota of sulfur quarries in LvivRegion. The dynamics of soil micromycete complexes as a result of their adaptation to the conditions of technozems, embryozems and zonal soils of sulfur quarries was studied. The increase in the number of colony-forming units (CFU) in the studied soils of the Yavoriv and Podorozhnie sulfur quarries over the years is specified, which indicates the active processes of decomposition of plant remains, the formation of stable processes of decomposition of cellulose and other complex compounds in the detrital block of the ecosystem. The change in the frequency of banding of selected species of micromycetes over the years was studied, depending on the content of SO4-2 in the soil solution. The functional structure of soil micromycete communities after sulfur extraction was established. A decrease in the frequency of occurrence of pathogens and toxin-producing agents and an increase in the frequency of occurrence of species that actively participate in the transformation of organic remains, and also act as plant endophytes and participants in mycorrhizal symbiosis were recorded. The species composition of micromycetes that grew in the presence of SO4-2 content in the soil solution, which exceeded the background level from 3.6% to 50%, was determined, the species-bioindicators of soil pollution with sulfur compounds were defined-Fusarium oxysporum, Paecilomyces lilacinum, P. waksmanii, P. nigricans, P. funiculosum, Trichoderma viride, Cladosporium cladosporioides, C. herbarum, Aureobasidium pullulans, Humicola grisea, Ulocladium consortiale, Alternaria alternate, Mortierella ramanniana var. angulispora. During 10 years of research a decrease in the content of SO4-2 in soils was noted, which is associated with an increase in the biodiversity of soil micromycetes and an enrichment of the phytocenotic cover. © 2023, Polskie Towarzystwo Inzynierii Ekologicznej (PTIE).

4382,Direct comparison of culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular approaches reveal the diversity of fungal endophytic communities in stems of grapevine (Vitis vinifera),"Grapevines (Vitis vinifera) are colonized by ubiquitous microorganisms known as endophytes, which may have advantageous or neutral effects without causing disease symptoms. Certain endophytes are uncultivable, so culture-independent approaches such as next generation sequencing (NGS) can help for a better understanding of their ecology and distribution. To date, there are no studies which directly link NGS results with taxa derived from a culturing approach, integrating morphological and multi-gene phylogenetic analysis of endophytes. In this study, a culture-dependent and high-resolution culture-independent approach (next generation sequencing) were used to identify endophytes in grapevine stems. In the culture-dependent approach, a total of 94 isolates were recovered from 84 of 144 healthy grapevine stem fragments (colonization rate = 58.3%). The study is unique as we used subsets of combined multi-gene regions to identify the endophytes to species level. Based on each multi-gene phylogenetic analysis, 28 species belong to 19 genera (Acremonium, Alternaria, Arthrinium, Ascorhizoctonia, Aspergillus, Aureobasidium, Bipolaris, Botryosphaeria, Botrytis, Chaetomium, Cladosporium, Curvularia, Hypoxylon, Lasiodiplodia, Mycosphaerella, Nigrospora, Penicillium, Phoma, Scopulariopsis) were identified. A higher number of culturable fungi were obtained from 13 year-old vines, followed by eight and three year-old vines. In the culture-independent approach, a fungal richness of 59 operational taxonomic units (OTU) was detected, being highest in 13 year-old grapevines, followed by eight and three years. Even though the cultivation approach detected lower fungal richness, the results related to stem are consistent for fungal community composition and richness. Comparison of the fungal taxa identified by the two approaches resulted in an overlap of 53% of the fungal genera. Due to interspecific variability of the sequences from NGS, in many cases the OTUs (even with the highly abundant ones) were only assignable to order, family or genus level. Incorporating multi-gene phylogenies we successfully identified many of the NGS derived OTUs with poor taxonomic information in reference databases to the genus or species levels. Hence, this study signifies the importance of applying both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches to study the fungal endophytic community composition in Vitis vinifera. This principle could also be applied to other host species and ecosystem level studies.","Dissanayake, AJ; Purahong, W; Wubet, T; Hyde, KD; Zhang, W; Xu, HY; Zhang, GJ; Fu, CY; Liu, M; Xing, QK; Li, XH; Yan, JY",FUNGAL DIVERSITY,2018,10.1007/s13225-018-0399-3,0.983591370187106,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99543189109895,0.00456810890105018,0.99999999804699,1.95301042005269e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
17082,"Actinoallomurus bryophytorum sp. nov., an endophytic actinomycete isolated from moss (Bryophyta).","A novel endophytic actinomycete, strain NEAU-TX1-15(T), was isolated from moss, collected from Wuchang, Heilongjiang province, north China. A polyphasic taxonomic study was carried out to establish the status of strain NEAU-TX1-15(T). Morphological and chemotaxonomic properties of strain NEAU-TX1-15(T) are consistent with the description of the genus Actinoallomurus. Strain NEAU-TX1-15(T) was observed to form short spiral or looped spore chains on aerial hyphae. The cell wall peptidoglycan was found to contain lysine and meso-diaminopimelic acid. The major menaquinones were identified as MK-9(H6) and MK-9(H8). The only phospholipid identified was phosphatidylglycerol. The major fatty acid was identified as iso-C16:0. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence supports the assignment of the novel strain to the genus Actinoallomurus, as it exhibits 99.2 % gene sequence similarity to that of Actinoallomurus yoronensis NBRC 103686(T). However, the low level of DNA-DNA relatedness allowed the strain to be differentiated from its close relative. Moreover, strain NEAU-TX1-15(T) could also be differentiated from A. yoronensis NBRC 103686(T) and other Actinoallomurus species showing high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (>98.0 %) by cultural and physiological characteristics. Therefore, the combination of phenotypic and chemotaxonomic data, and the DNA-DNA hybridization value, indicated that strain NEAU-TX1-15(T) represents a novel species of the genus Actinoallomurus for which the name Actinoallomurus bryophytorum sp. nov. is proposed.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the distribution of rhizosphere and endophytic fungi on C. japonicum in its native habitat. A total of 440 rhizosphere and 79 endosphere fungi isolates were isolated and identified on the basis of their molecular characteristics. Sixty-five genera and 119 fungi species were identified in this study. The genus Trichoderma showed the highest abundance among both rhizosphere and endosphere fungi. Mortierella, Hypocrea, and Penicillium spp. were also relatively dominant species on C. japonicum.

12286,Indirect effects of non-native Spartina alterniflora and its fungal pathogen (Fusarium palustre) on native saltmarsh plants in China,"1. Pathogens can affect their hosts and change community composition and structure. Pathogens may be key determinants of biological invasions. However, few empirical studies exist examining how non-native plants drive their invasions through indirect effects involved with pathogens. Here, indirect effects refer to how one species alters the effect that another species has on a third. 2. Fusarium palustre was associated with the dieback of Spartina alterniflora in its native North American saltmarshes. Native plant Phragmites australis was also found to die back in the Dongtan wetland of the Chinese Yangtze River estuary invaded by non-native Spartina alterniflora. This phenomenon suggests that Spartina might not escape from its pathogen when being introduced from its native North America and has indirectly caused the dieback of Phragmites in China. 3. To investigate the indirect effect of Spartina involving Fusarium, we sampled plants and soils in dieback patches to isolate the pathogen. Next, we used an artificial inoculation study to determine the virulence of Fusarium to both Phragmites and Spartina. Finally, the spatial distribution of Fusarium was studied through examining its incidence in saltmarshes along the east coast of China. 4. The endophytic fungus F. palustre was found to be closely associated with Phragmites dieback in the Dongtan wetland and it is likely that it was transported by non-native Spartina from its native North American saltmarshes to the Chinese saltmarshes. The spillover of F. palustre from non-native Spartina to native Phragmites might subsequently facilitate Spartina invasion. 5. Synthesis. Invasive plants do not only directly compete with native plants, but also indirectly cause pathogen infection on the latter, by acting as vectors and reservoirs for pathogens shared with native plants. Our findings highlight the significance of indirect effects involving pathogens in biological invasions. It is necessary to consider these pathogen-mediated indirect effects of non-native plant species in multi-host-pathogen systems for management and restoration purposes.","Li, H; Zhang, XM; Zheng, RS; Li, X; Elmer, WH; Wolfe, LM; Li, B",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2014,10.1111/1365-2745.12285,0.929541071733194,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.88694766225391,0.11305233774609,0.999999995291409,4.70859051748818e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
18975,Advances and mechanisms of fungal symbionts in improving the salt tolerance of crops.,"Soil salinization leads to reduced crop yields and waste of land resources, thereby impacting global food security. To meet the increasing demand for food and simultaneously alleviate pressure on soil resources, the development of sustainable agriculture is imperative. In contrast to physical and chemical methods, bioremediation represents an efficient and environmentally friendly approach. Fungal symbionts have been found to be associated with most plants in natural ecosystems, colonizing and residing within the internal tissues of host plants. Moreover, the potential of fungal symbionts in improving saline-alkaline soil has been widely recognized and confirmed. Numerous reports have documented the effectiveness of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in alleviating salt stress in plants. Meanwhile, research on other endophytic fungi for mitigating plant salt stress has emerged in recent years, which contributes to refining mechanisms for enhancing plant salt tolerance. In this review, we summarized various mechanisms by which endophytic fungi enhance plant salt tolerance.

10716,EFFECTS OF SEED AND FOLIAR FUNGICIDES ON PROGRESS OF NET BLOTCH AND YIELD IN BARLEY,"Effects of systemic fungicides on progress of net blotch, caused by Pyrenophora teres, were examined in field plots. Disease intensities and apparent infection rates (r values) in barley grown from carbathiin-treated seeds were similar to those of the checks 29-30 days and later. Etaconazole used as a seed treatment reduced disease intensities for about 29-42 days, but r values later accelerated and exceeded those of the checks. Propiconazole applied to the foliage at early tillering reduced r for about 12 days, but disease subsequently progressed more rapidly than in the checks. Applications of propiconazole at spike emergence reduced r for 13-15 days. According to the observed r values and disease intensities, the following temporal relationships of fungicide applications and disease progress were recognized: (1) period of reduced epidemic rates; (2) period of accelerated epidemic rates; (3) period of epidemiologic impact of the fungicide (the summation of 1 and 2). Seed treatments and tillering sprays failed to increase barley yields significantly. However, when propiconazole was applied at spike emergence, or at both tillering and spike emergence, 1000-kernel weights increased by 17.3% and 17.8%, respectively, at 1 location, and grain yields by 14.2% and 19.1% at a 2nd location.","SUTTON, JC; STEELE, P",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE,1983,10.4141/cjps83-080,0.69575445946836,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.989085726612974,0.0109142733870259,0.999999823815407,1.76184593470019e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
14923,Endophytic ancestors of modern leaf miners may have evolved in the Late Carboniferous,"Endophytic feeding behaviors, including stem borings and galling, have been observed in the fossil record from as early as the Devonian and involve the consumption of a variety of plant (and fungal) tissues. Historically, the exploitation of internal stem tissues through galling has been well documented as emerging during the Pennsylvanian (c. 323–299 million years ago (Ma)), replaced during the Permian by galling of foliar tissues. However, leaf mining, a foliar endophytic behavior that today is exhibited exclusively by members of the four hyperdiverse holometabolous insect orders, has been more sparsely documented, with confirmed examples dating back only to the Early Triassic (c. 252–250 Ma). Here, we describe a trace fossil on seed-fern foliage from the Rhode Island Formation of Massachusetts, USA, representing the earliest indication of a general, endophytic type of feeding damage and dating from the Middle Pennsylvanian (c. 312 Ma). Although lacking the full features of Mesozoic leaf mines, this specimen provides evidence of how endophytic mining behavior may have originated. It sheds light on the evolutionary transition to true foliar endophagy, contributes to our understanding of the behaviors of early holometabolous insects, and enhances our knowledge of macroevolutionary patterns of plant–insect interactions. © 2023 The Authors.

12883,Piriformospora indica: A versatile root endophytic symbiont,"Piriformospora indica, a unique root endophytic basidiomycete, exhibits symbiotic association with a variety of host plants. Spacio-temporally, the biphasic lifestyle of the fungus is characterized by distinct biotrophic and cell death associated root colonization processes. Fungal components such as fungal chitin induce specific host immune responses which also play an important role in establishing a successful sustainable interaction. The fungus-induced Pattern Triggered Immunity (PTI) is regulated by a complex interplay amongst the various phytohormones and anti-microbial molecules. The association so built up imparts a broad spectrum of benefits to the host viz., high salt tolerance, disease resistance, resistance to heavy metal toxicity, and growth-promotion involving value addition. These characteristics of P. indica can be translated into specific applications in agriculture and horticulture.

810,Diversity and host preference of fungi co-inhabiting Cenococcum mycorrhizae,"Diverse fungal assemblages colonize the fine feeder roots of woody plants, including mycorrhizal fungi, fungal root endophytes and soil saprotrophs. The fungi co-inhabiting Cenococcum geophilum ectomycorrhizae (ECM) of Allies balsamea, Betula papyrifera and Picea glauca were studied at two boreal forest sites in Eastern Canada by direct PCR of ITS rDNA. 50 non-Cenococcum fungal sequence types were detected, including several potentially mycorrhizal species as well as fungal root endophytes. Non-melanized ascomycetes dominated, in contrast to the dark septate endophytes (DSE) reported in most culture dependent studies. The results demonstrate significant differences in root associated fungal assemblages among the host species studied. Fungal diversity was also host dependent, with P. glauca roots supporting a more diverse community than A. balsamea. Differences in root associated fungal communities may well influence ecological interactions among host plant species. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

Treatments included a commercial stock diet (C), 50% stock plus 50% non-infected tall fescue seed (N), and 50% stock plus 50% infected tall fescue seed (I). The experiment was conducted using mice on respective treatments in 2 phases (successive generations), with 15 to 23 mated females per line and diet subgroups. Mated females of Phase 1 were assigned at random within line to experimental diets which were fed during gestation and through 21 d of lactation. Litters were standardized to 10 pups 1 d after birth. Stock diets were fed to all groups from Day 21 to weaning on Day 28. Weaned male and female pups were allotted to previous diets. Mated females in Phase 2 were managed as in Phase 1 through weaning at 28 d. Diets of males did not affect reproduction and data were pooled within female diets. Selected (L(+)) dams gave birth to more live pups than K dams (P<0.05) during both phases (+3.4 and +2.8 +/- 0.4 pups, respectively). Diet but not line affected littering rate of mated females in Phase 1 (71.3%, I; <87.1%, C or 93.0%, N; P <0.05) and Phase 2 (82.1%, I<93.8%, N or 97.1%, C; P<0.05). Diet had no effect on fecundity during Phase 1 but females on I diet had reduced (P<0.05) litter size by 1.9 and 3.2 +/- 0.5 pups compared with the females on N and C diets, respectively, in Phase 2. Feed consumption and weights of dams during lactation generally ranked C>N>I. Growth of pups during both phases also ranked C>N>I.

2442,Epichloë bromicola Enhances Elymus dahucirus Plant Growth and Antioxidant Capacity under Cadmium Stress,"Elymus dahucirus is an essential plant for ecological restoration in fragile ecological areas and mining area restoration. As lawn grass, it can quickly cover soil and prevent soil erosion, so it is commonly used as a pioneer grass for lawn greening and slope protection. In recent years, with the development of mineral resources, Qinghai-Tibet Plateau soil is facing the threat of heavy metal cadmium (Cd) pollution.

To make better use of the advantages that Epichloe bring to host plants to alleviate heavy metal pollution in soil, plant growth and antioxidant capacity effects on E. bromicola infected (E+) and uninfected (E-) E. dahuricus were determined under Cd stress. During Cd treatment, plant growth was decreased by Cd stress, while E+ plants exhibited equal or better growth compared to E- plants. Cd treatment induces a proline and antioxidant enzyme burst in infected plants, while malondialdehyde (MDA) increases. E. bromicola improved plant growth and antioxidant capacity. E. dahuricus breeding strategies could use the information here in efforts to improve the performance of E. dahuricus in both environmental protection and agronomic contexts.","Shi, Q; Simpson, WR; Li, YL; Xu, CT; De, KJ; Li, XZ",AGRONOMY-BASEL,2024,10.3390/agronomy14020365,0.830122860580095,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99745701900674,0.00254298099326012,0.999999998096898,1.90310212033751e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

This mixed fungicide at two concentrations (3 and 3.5 gm/kg seed) gave 99.3 and 99.4 per cent reduction in tiller infection and 30.6 and 32.6 per cent increase in grain yield over control. However, variation in increase of yield and yield attributing characters and decrease in tiller infection under the ST with mixed fungicide at lower doses (@ 2 and 2.5 gm/kg seed) remained statistically insignificant. Plant height and car length data did not reveal significant change under different treatments as compared to untreated check. It can be concluded that ST with mixed formulation of Carbendazim 25% + Mancozeb 50% WS(Sprinf) @ 3.0 g/kg seed can control smut disease of wheat economically at farmer's fields.",Gaur R.B.; Sharma R.N.,Pestology,2011,NA,0.898115426284399,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.705070889325257,0.294929110674743,0.999938130833382,6.18691666175453e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
665,Paradendryphiella arenariae an endophytic fungus of Centella asiatica inhibits the bacterial pathogens of fish and shellfish,"Introduction Aquaculture has been considered a major food-producing sector in the world during the last few decades. The foremost constraint in the development of aquaculture is bacterial disease control and management. Since various fish pathogens are resistant to conservative treatments, it is essential to screen new and effective alternative antibacterial agents. Endophytic fungi are microorganisms that live in the plant's internal tissues without harming its host. Endophytic fungi have proven themselves as reliable sources of novel bioactive compounds that can be used as antibacterial agents.Methods In the present study, fifteen morphologically different endophytic fungi were isolated from the fresh and healthy stem section of Centella asiatica. The active endophytic fungal crude extracts were tested for agar well diffusion assay, Minimum Inhibitory Concentration, Minimum Bactericidal Concentration assays, Time-kill kinetic analysis, Brine shrimp lethality assay.Results and Discussion Agar plug diffusion and agar well diffusion assays revealed that endophytic fungus CAS1 exhibits maximum antagonistic activity against bacterial fish pathogens. The ethyl acetate crude extract of CAS1 exhibited the maximum zone of inhibitions against Aeromonas hydrophila (21 +/- 0.11 mm), Aeromonas caviae (18 +/- 0.1 mm), Edwardsiella tarda (23 +/- 0.11 mm), Vibrio anguillarum (19 +/- 0.05 mm) and Vibrio harveyi (20 +/- 0.27 mm). The MIC and MBC values extract varied reliant on the trial pathogens ranging between 12.5-100 mu g/mL and 25-100 mu g/mL correspondingly. The morphological and molecular characterization of potential isolate CAS1 was confirmed as Paradendryphiella arenariae by 18S rRNA ITS gene sequencing with 99.18% identity. This is the foremost findings to study the antagonistic effect of Paradendryphiella arenariae isolated from the stem of Centella asiatica against bacterial fish pathogens which can be used as natural effective antibacterial agents in aquaculture.","Shankar, S; Sathiavelu, M",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2024,10.3389/fmicb.2024.1441525,0.902415117601081,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99270232863073,0.00729767136927032,0.999999999433758,5.66241609156748e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18773,Leaf Spot Caused by Irpex lacteus on Tobacco in China.,"Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) is an important commercial crop in China. In June 2023, disease symptoms were seen in a commercial tobacco field in Bijie City (27.09° N, 105.36° E), Guizhou province, China. Typical symptoms first appeared on the lower leaves as round brown spots, with a light center and a faint yellow small halo. Approximately 25% of the plants were symptomatic in a 3.5-ha field. From 8 plants, 16 small pieces of leaf tissue (6 × 6 mm) were cut from the edge of the lesions, including live and dead portions. These were surface sterilized in 1% hypochlorite for 30 s, and then placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with kanamycin (0.1 mg/ml). After 48 hours at 28 °C, 12 fungal strains were recovered. Eight strains presented a consistent morphology, while the remaining four strains varied in morphology. All 12 strains were tested for pathogenicity on detached leaves and only the eight (presenting a consistent morphology) showed disease. The other four strains showed no disease. A representative isolate, MDY, was selected for causal agent identification. The hyphae were white, slightly raised, thin-walled, straight, and 2.0-4.0 μm in diameter. There was no detectable odor. Conidia were numerous, clustered, ovoid, colorless, and 5-8 µm x 4-5 µm. These characteristics were similar to those reported for Irpex lacteus (Chi et al. 2002). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS), large ribosomal subunit (LSU) and small ribosomal subunit (SSU) loci of isolate MDY were, respectively, amplified with primers ITS1/ITS4, LR5/LROR, and NS1/NS4 (Schoch et al. 1998; Melnikov et al. 2012), and sequenced using both forward and reverse primers. Consensus sequences from each pair of primers were used in BLAST against the NCBI GenBank database. The ITS sequence (OR366346) showed 99.9% identity (648/649 bp) with I. lacteus (MH890689), the LSU sequence (OR878461) showed 99.6% identity (904/908 bp) with I. lacteus (MH867969), and the SSU sequence (OR878462) showed 99.5% identity (969/974 bp) with I. lacteus (MF190370). Neighbor-Joining analysis was carried out using the ITS sequence of MDY, several related sequences from GenBank, and Macrocybe gigantea OQ644634 as outgroup. MDY clustered with other I. lacteus sequences with 95% bootstrap support. Morphological and molecular results supported this isolate as I. lacteus. Pathogenicity was tested on six tobacco seedlings (cv. Yunyan 87) at the six-leaf stage using hyphal plugs from isolate MDY on non-wounded attached leaves, while controls received PDA plugs. This test involving three treated plants and three control plants was repeated three times. All tobacco seedlings were kept in a growth chamber at 25 ± 5 °C and 85% relative humidity. After 7 days, leaf spots similar to field symptoms were observed on the treated leaves, while no symptoms were observed on control leaves. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by re-isolation of the pathogen from the diseased leaves, confirmed by ITS sequencing. From previous work, I. lacteus was described and reported as an endophyte in tobacco in Enshi, Hubei (Yuan et al. 2018), and some endophytes are known to be latent pathogens (Brown et al. 1998), but to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of I. lacteus causing tobacco leaf spots.

16931,Endophytic bacterial diversity in rice (Oryza sativa L.) roots estimated by 16S rDNA sequence analysis.,"The endophytic bacterial diversity in the roots of rice (Oryza sativa L.) growing in the agricultural experimental station in Hebei Province, China was analyzed by 16S rDNA cloning, amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), and sequence homology comparison. To effectively exclude the interference of chloroplast DNA and mitochondrial DNA of rice, a pair of bacterial PCR primers (799f-1492r) was selected to specifically amplify bacterial 16S rDNA sequences directly from rice root tissues. Among 192 positive clones in the 16S rDNA library of endophytes, 52 OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) were identified based on the similarity of the ARDRA banding profiles. Sequence analysis revealed diverse phyla of bacteria in the 16S rDNA library, which consisted of alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon subclasses of the Proteobacteria, Cytophaga/Flexibacter/Bacteroides (CFB) phylum, low G+C gram-positive bacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Acidobacteria, and archaea. The dominant group was Betaproteobacteria (27.08% of the total clones), and the most dominant genus was Stenotrophomonas. More than 14.58% of the total clones showed high similarity to uncultured bacteria, suggesting that nonculturable bacteria were detected in rice endophytic bacterial community. To our knowledge, this is the first report that archaea has been identified as endophytes associated with rice by the culture-independent approach. The results suggest that the diversity of endophytic bacteria is abundant in rice roots.",Sun L; Qiu F; Zhang X; Dai X; Dong X; Song W,Microbial ecology,2008,10.1007/s00248-007-9287-1,0.940575347597875,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.869005029150322,0.130994970849678,0.999979684571908,2.03154280924434e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
5780,Metabolomic effects of the colonization of Medicago truncatula by the facultative endophyte Arthrobacter agilis UMCV2 in a foliar inoculation system,"Biofertilizer production and application for sustainable agriculture is already a reality. The methods for biofertilizers delivery in crop fields are diverse. Although foliar spray is gaining wide acceptance, little is known about the influence that the biochemical features of leaves have on the microbial colonization. Arthrobacter agilis UMCV2 is a rhizospheric and endophytic bacteria that promotes plant growth and health. In this study, we determined the capacity of the UMCV2 strain to colonize different leaves from Medicago truncatula in a foliar inoculation system. By using two powerful analytical methods based on mass spectrometry, we determined the chemical profile of the leaves in 15-d old plants. The metabolic signatures between the unifoliate leaf (m1) and the metameric units developing above (m2 and m3) were different, and interestingly, the highest colony forming units (CFU) was found in m1. The occurrence of the endophyte strongly affects the sugar composition in m1 and m2 leaves. Our results suggest that A. agilis UMCV2 colonize the leaves under a foliar inoculation system independently of the phenological age of the leaf and it is capable of modulating the carbohydrate metabolism without affecting the rest of the metabolome.","Ramírez-Ordorica, A; Valencia-Cantero, E; Flores-Cortez, I; Carrillo-Rayas, MT; Elizarraraz-Anaya, IC; Montero-Vargas, J; Winkler, R; Macías-Rodríguez, L",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2020,10.1038/s41598-020-65314-4,0.966175946278059,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.971909705038725,0.0280902949612748,0.999999998808498,1.1915024522579601e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

15277,Inoculum Concentration and Mineral Fertilization: Effects on the Endophytic Microbiome of Soybean,"Soybean crops are of great economic importance worldwide and in Brazil. This crop is a commodity that provides large amounts of financial resources to the country. Soybean productivity is influenced by several biotic and abiotic factors, and most of these factors cannot be controlled by agricultural practices. Due to the soybean cultivars used and their required yields, the soybean crop, similar to other agriculturally important crops, requires large amounts of mineral fertilizers. There are several microorganisms that colonize soybean plant roots without causing symptoms or damage. These microorganisms that colonize plant tissues are called endophytes and can often promote plant growth and development. Little is known about the factors that influence endophyticism. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether Bacillus subtilis inoculant concentrations and levels of mineral fertilization recommended for the crop have any influence on the endophytic microbiome of soybean plant roots. The results show that B. subtilis inoculations did not affect the endophytic community of the roots; however, the evaluation of the microbial community structure according to the alpha diversity metrics observed richness, Chao1 index, Shannon index and Simpson index showed that microbial diversity of endophytes was higher at fertilization levels of 50 and 100%, with a significant difference (p < 0.05) between 0 and 50% and 0 and 100% fertilization.

10513,Identification of Mellein as a Pathogenic Substance of Botryosphaeria dothidea by UPLC-MS/MS Analysis and Phytotoxic Bioassay,"Botryosphaeria dothidea is a pathogenic fungus that can cause apple ring rot, a destructive apple disease in China. There have been reports on its molecular pathogenesis, but the pathogenic substances still remain unknown. In the present study, instrument analysis including UPLC-high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance showed that B. dothidea fermentation broth contained (R)-(-)-mellein, a well-known fungal enantiomer of mellein. For further confirmation, a UPLC-MS/MS method for the determination of mellein was developed and validated. By this method, mellein was found to also exist in B. dothidea-infected apple fruits and branches with concentration ranges of 0.14-0.94 and 5.88-80.29 mg/kg, respectively. The concentration in fruits reached a peak at 48 h after pathogen inoculation, while a sustained concentration increase was achieved within 11 days for branches. Simultaneously, it was evident that there was a relation between disease spot expansion and mellein production kinetics in apple tissue. Phytotoxic bioassay showed that mellein could cause discoloration and death of apple leaves and browning in stems. Therefore, we confirmed that mellein was one of the pathogenic substances of B. dothidea. The present study provided additional data for the research on the pathogenesis of this pathogen.","Li, YZ; Gai, Z; Wang, CX; Li, PL; Li, BH",JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY,2021,10.1021/acs.jafc.1c03249,0.801730601572353,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996900112334801,0.00309988766519931,0.999976123775336,2.38762246642654e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

5589,Characteristics of bacteria from oilseed rape in relation to their biocontrol activity against Verticillium dahliae,"The potential of bacteria that are adapted to the oilseed rape root environment for use in the biological control of Verticillium dahliae, Kleb was investigated in both controlled and non-sterile growth conditions. Bacterial strains dominated by the red-pigmented members of enterobacteriaceae were isolated from thoroughly washed and air-dried root segments of symptomless young rape plants. Other associated strains found either belonged to Alcaligenes sp., Stenotrophomonas spp. and Pseudomonas spp. (Pseudomonas acidovorans and Pseudomonas putida) or were unidentified according to fatty acid methyl ester profile analysis. A total of 19 strains isolated in this study together with two previously studied strains, Serratia proteamaculans and Pseudomonas chlororaphis, were characterized on the basis of their interactions with V. dahliae and a number of functional characteristics. In line with earlier observations with root-colonizing fungi also from oilseed rape, all bacterial strains suppressed the pathogen not only directly and but also indirectly in in vitro assays. Mechanisms of suppression were apparently multifold among the strains, but production of hydrogen cyanide does not seem to be involved in indirect inhibition. The majority of the strains possessed the ability to produce cellulases, proteases and phosphatases and some even produced chitinases and induced hypersensitive responses, indicating their potential for nutrient acquisition as well as colonization capacity and active recognition by the plant cells. Investigations in non-sterile field soil revealed that some strains protected rape plants from V. dahliae partly by delaying symptom development. None of the strains, however, was strongly deleterious to rape growth either in the presence or absence of the pathogen. Light microscopic observations of roots and results based on agar printing techniques revealed the potential of the studied strains to colonize or interfere with the pathogen colonization. This study provides some insight into the evolved relationship of bacterial residents with their host in terms of their potential importance in its fitness.","Alström, S",JOURNAL OF PHYTOPATHOLOGY,2001,10.1046/j.1439-0434.2001.00585.x,0.936607631550673,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.982490753458688,0.0175092465413117,0.999999996639893,3.3601073035072204e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11960,Evaluation of Mobility and Dissipation of Mefenoxam and Pendimethalin by Application of CSTR Model and Field Experiments Using Bare and Tobacco Tilled Soil Columns,"The soil mobility and dissipation of two pesticides with different physicochemical properties, namely mefenoxam, a systemic fungicide, and pendimethalin a selective herbicide, were determined in bare and tobacco tilled soil columns, which were installed in field conditions for over 125 days. Soil samples were collected at specific time intervals for a 125-day period and the rate of pesticide dissipation and leaching through the soil column was studied. The dissipation half-lives of mefenoxam from the top soil layer in tilled and bare soil columns were estimated at 10.3 and 13.1 days, respectively, while the corresponding half-lives for pendimethalin were 26.7 and 27.5 days, respectively. The dissipation of mefenoxam and pendimethalin from the top soil in tobacco cultivation was faster in comparison with bare soil; however, 120 days after their application, both pesticide residues were detected in the soil. Maximum concentrations of mefenoxam and pendimethalin were observed on the 15(th) and 33(rd) day, respectively, in the soil layer of 5-10 cm depth and on the 30(th) day and 63(rd) day, respectively, in the soil layer of 10-15 cm depth. Higher concentrations were observed in bare soil columns. The leaching of both pesticides was simulated with the continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) in series model.

However, the distribution of endophytes within medicinal plants P. notoginseng and how it contributes to the conversion of saponins are not well understood. Here, we determined the distribution of saponins and endophytes within P. notoginseng compartments and further confirm the saponin conversion by endophytes. We found metabolites showed compartment specificity within P. notoginseng. Potential saponin biomarkers, such as Rb1, Rg1, Re, Rc and Rd, were obtained. Endophytic diversity, composition and co-occurrence networks also showed compartment specificity, and bacterial alpha diversity values were highest in root compartment, consistently decreased in the stem and leaf compartments, whereas those of fungi showed the opposite trend. Potential bacterial biomarkers, such as Rhizobium, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Klebsiella, Pantoea and fungal biomarkers Phoma, Epicoccum, Xylariales, were also obtained. Endophytes related to saponin contents were found by Spearman correlation analysis, and further verification experiments showed that Enterobacter chengduensis could convert ginsenoside Rg1 to F1 at a rate of 13.24%; Trichoderma koningii could convert ginsenoside Rb1 to Rd at a rate of 40.00% and to Rg3 at a rate of 32.31%; Penicillium chermesinum could convert ginsenoside Rb1 to Rd at a rate of 74.24%.","Wei, GF; Chen, ZJ; Wang, B; Wei, FG; Zhang, GZ; Wang, Y; Zhu, GW; Zhou, YX; Zhao, QH; He, MJ; Dong, LL; Chen, SL",MICROBIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY,2021,10.1111/1751-7915.13842,0.986101938096372,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.938090494074666,0.0619095059253343,0.999999997983075,2.0169247383350402e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
7273,The defensive role of foliar endophytic fungi for a South American tree,"Fungal endophytes colonize living internal plant tissues without causing any visible symptoms of disease. Endophytic fungi associated with healthy leaves may play an important role in the protection of hosts against herbivores and pathogens. In this study, the diversity of foliar endophytic fungi (FEF) of the southern temperate tree Embothriumcoccineum (Proteaceae), as well as their role in plant protection in nature was determined. Fungal endophytes were isolated from 40 asymptomatic leaves by the culture method for molecular identification of the 18S rRNA gene. A relationship between FEF frequency and plant protection was evaluated in juveniles of E. coccineum. Fungal endophyte frequency was estimated using real-time PCR analyses to determine endophyte DNA content per plant. A total of 178 fungal isolates were identified, with sequence data revealing 34 different operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A few common taxa dominated the fungal endophyte community, whereas most taxa qualified as rare. A significant positive correlation between plant protection (evaluated in terms of percentage of leaf damage) and FEF frequency was found. Furthermore, in vitro confrontation assays indicated that FEF were able to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens. The data showed a relatively high diversity of fungal endophytes associated with leaves of E. coccineum, and suggest a positive relationship between fungal endophyte frequencies in leaves and host protection in nature.","González-Teuber, M",AOB PLANTS,2016,10.1093/aobpla/plw050,0.952963697387821,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.937640791389854,0.0623592086101463,0.99993733552437,6.2664475630303e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
17379,First Report of Sclerotinia Stem Rot of Anemone Caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in Korea.,"In Korea, anemones (Anemone coronaria L.) are mostly grown during winter, in polyethylene tunnels that may have high humidity and poor ventilation, to meet the high demand of cut flowers in February and March for school ceremonies. During the winter of 2011 to 2012, symptoms typical of Sclerotinia stem rot were observed in commercial crops of anemone (cv. Rosso Mistral Plus) in Hwaseong City, Korea. About 40% of anemones withered or died before harvest due to the disease, causing considerable economic losses. In one farmer's polyethylene tunnel with a good ventilation system in Icheon City, Korea, less than 1% of the anemones showed Sclerotinia stem rot during the same season. Symptoms included stem necrosis and withering of leaves, followed by crown rot and wilt a few days afterward. White cottony growth of the fungus was observed on dead plants and the nearby soil surface, especially under high relative humidity. Black sclerotia 2 to 7 mm in diameter developed in the mycelium. Isolations from surface-disinfested stem pieces onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) consistently yielded white, fluffy colonies. Two-week-old colonies produced plentiful numbers of sclerotia on PDA. The isolated fungus was morphologically identified as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary (1,3). Voucher specimens (n = 4) were deposited in the Korea University herbarium (KUS). Two isolates were deposited in the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection with accession numbers KACC46708 (ex KUS-F26433) and KACC46834 (ex KUS-F26437), respectively. Fungal DNA was extracted with a DNeasy Plant Mini DNA Extraction Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA was amplified with the primers ITS1/ITS4 (4) and sequenced using an ABI Prism 337 automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA). The resulting sequences of 501 bp were deposited in GenBank (Accession Nos. KC412065 and KC412066). A BLAST search revealed that sequences of the two Korean isolates showed 100% identity with those of S. sclerotiorum (e.g., GenBank Accession No. JN012606). A pathogenicity test was achieved by placing agar segments (9 mm2) from a 7-day-old culture grown on PDA on the stems of healthy anemones (cv. Rosso Mistral Plus) near the soil line. Three plants inoculated with agar blocks served as controls. Plants were maintained in a greenhouse at 16 to 20°C and relative humidity >90%. After 2 days, all inoculated stems became discolored, soft, watery, and covered with white mycelia, whereas control plants remained symptomless. S. sclerotiorum was consistently reisolated from the symptomatic tissue, fulfilling Koch's postulates. Sclerotinia stem rot of anemones caused by S. sclerotiorum has previously been recorded from the United States and New Zealand (2), and to our knowledge, this is the first report of S. sclerotiorum on anemone in Korea. According to our observations in damaged plots, low temperature, high humidity, poor ventilation, and continuous cultivation would accelerate the incidence of Sclerotinia stem rot in polyethylene tunnel cultivation systems in Korea.

5185,Diversity of soil fungal communities of Cerrado and its closely surrounding agriculture fields,"Cerrado is a savanna-like region that covers a large area of Brazil. Despite its biological importance, the Cerrado has been the focus of few microbial diversity studies. A molecular approach was chosen to characterize the soil fungal communities in four areas of the Cerrado biome: a native Cerrado, a riverbank forest, an area converted to a soybean plantation, and an area converted to pasture. Global diversity of fungal communities in each area was assessed through Ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis which revealed remarkable differences among the areas studied. Sequencing of approximately 200 clones containing 18S rDNA sequences from each library was performed and, according to the genetic distance between sequences, these were assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A total of 75, 85, 85, and 70 OTUs were identified for the native Cerrado, riverbank forest, pasture, and soybean plantation, respectively. Analysis of sequences using a similarity cutoff value of 1% showed that the number of OTUs for the native Cerrado area was reduced by 35%; for the soybean plantation, a reduction by more than 50% was observed, indicating a reduction in fungal biodiversity associated with anthropogenic activity. This is the first study demonstrating the anthropogenic impact on Cerrado soil fungal diversity.","de Castro, AP; Quirino, BF; Pappas, G; Kurokawa, AS; Neto, EL; Krüger, RH",ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY,2008,10.1007/s00203-008-0374-6,0.957417999881447,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.914164421721013,0.0858355782789869,0.999222703673707,7.7729632629308e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10436,Comprehensive Analysis of Transcriptome and Metabolome Elucidates the Molecular Regulatory Mechanism of Salt Resistance in Roots of Achnatherum inebrians Mediated by Epichloe gansuensis,"Salinization of soil is a major environmental risk factor to plant functions, leading to a reduction of productivity of crops and forage. Epichloe gansuensis, seed-borne endophytic fungi, establishes a mutualistic symbiotic relationship with Achnatherum inebrians and confers salt tolerance in the host plants. In this study, analysis of transcriptome and metabolome was used to explore the potential molecular mechanism underlying the salt-adaptation of A. inebrians roots mediated by E. gansuensis. We found that E. gansuensis played an important role in the gene expression of the host's roots and regulated multiple pathways involved in amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, TCA cycle, secondary metabolism, and lipid metabolism in the roots of A. inebrians. Importantly, E. gansuensis significantly induced the biological processes, including exocytosis, glycolytic process, fructose metabolic process, and potassium ion transport in roots of host plants at transcriptional levels, and altered the pathways, including inositol phosphate metabolism, galactose metabolism, starch, and sucrose metabolism at metabolite levels under NaCl stress. These findings provided insight into the molecular mechanism of salt resistance in roots of A. inebrians mediated by E. gansuensis and could drive progress in the cultivation of new salt-resistance breeds with endophytes.","Wang, C; Huang, R; Wang, JF; Jin, J; Malik, K; Niu, XL; Tang, R; Hou, WP; Cheng, C; Liu, YL; Liu, J",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2022,10.3390/jof8101092,0.947180945969386,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998215042470883,0.00178495752911708,0.999999523815769,4.76184230713272e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
8972,"Comparative effects of Serendipita indica and a mix of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on the growth, photosynthetic capacity, and proteomics of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi","Main conclusionBoth, Serendipita indica and AMF, show promise as sustainable biofertilizers for reforestation, improving nutrient uptake and stress tolerance, despite contrasting effects on photosynthetic capacity and biomass allocation.AbstractReclaiming degraded areas is essential for biodiversity conservation and enhancing ecosystem services enhancement, especially when using native species. This study investigated Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi, a native Brazilian species, and its compatibility with plant growth-promoting microorganisms (PGPM), including an endophytic fungus (Serendipita indica) and a consortium of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), to identify effective strategies for reforestation in nutrient-poor environments. We observed growth stimulation by both PGPMs; however, S. indica primarily enhanced root weight, whereas AMF improved shoot weight. S. indica's positive effects on root systems could be attributed to increased auxin levels and altered root architecture, which are critical for seedling establishment in reforestation programs. In terms of nutritional status, both treatments increased the content of most nutrients, with higher micronutrient contents in the shoots and higher macronutrient content in roots of inoculated plants. Despite AMF's role in enhancing photosynthesis, plants inoculated with these fungi showed reduced photosynthetic capacity traits, possibly due to lower leaf nitrogen content. The proteomic analysis of Schinus terebinthifolius leaf extracts revealed that, despite the upregulation of several proteins associated with the photosynthetic apparatus in response to S. indica treatment, no enhancement in photosynthetic capacity was observed. We also found several proteins related to oxidative stress in plants inoculated with both fungi, indicating a greater tolerance to adverse environmental conditions. These findings underscore the potential of both, S. indica and AMF, as sustainable alternatives to chemical fertilizers in reforestation efforts, enhancing seedling quality and survival in nutrient-poor soils.","Bertolazi, AA; Passamani, LZ; de Souza, SB; Rodrigues, WP; Campostrini, E; Pinto, VB; Silveira, V; de Rezende, CE; Cruz, C; Cardoso, EJBN; Ramos, AC",PLANTA,2025,10.1007/s00425-025-04608-1,0.809070213299583,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996804614596436,0.00319538540356427,0.999999999999654,3.45834472170736e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6405,SYSTEMIC FUNGICIDES FOR CONTROL OF DWARF BUNT OF WHEAT .2. FOLIAR APPLICATION,"Fungicide (21) formulations were applied as fall or spring foliar sprays to the dwarf bunt-susceptible winter wheat (T. aestivum) cv. Wanser during 1975-1981. Several contact-type fungicides, as well as some systemic compounds, controlled dwarf bunt when applied as fall sprays. It is suspected that most, but not all, of the control from fall applications of the systemic fungicides resulted from direct action against teliospores of Tilletia controversa at or near the soil surface. In most years and with most fungicides, spring foliar applications were ineffective in controlling dwarf bunt. Etaconazole, however, significantly reduced infection in 3 of the 4 yr it was tested and provided the 1st indication that the dwarf bunt fungus can be eradicated once it has become established in the wheat plant.","DEWEY, WG; HOFFMANN, JA; CALL, JE; RINE, SM",PLANT DISEASE,1983,10.1094/PD-67-297,0.917942365121145,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990779903855128,0.0092200961448721409,0.999999999359982,6.40017594477627e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
433,Endophytic Fungi: An Effective Alternative Source of Plant-Derived Bioactive Compounds for Pharmacological Studies,"Plant-associated fungi (endophytic fungi) are a biodiversity-rich group of microorganisms that are normally found asymptomatically within plant tissues or in the intercellular spaces. Endophytic fungi promote the growth of host plants by directly producing secondary metabolites, which enhances the plant's resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Additionally, they are capable of biosynthesizing medically important ""phytochemicals"" that were initially thought to be produced only by the host plant. In this review, we summarized some compounds from endophyte fungi with novel structures and diverse biological activities published between 2011 and 2021, with a focus on the origin of endophytic fungi, the structural and biological activity of the compounds they produce, and special attention paid to the exploration of pharmacological activities and mechanisms of action of certain compounds. This review revealed that endophytic fungi had high potential to be harnessed as an alternative source of secondary metabolites for pharmacological studies.","Wen, J; Okyere, SK; Wang, S; Wang, JC; Xie, L; Ran, YA; Hu, YC",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2022,10.3390/jof8020205,0.877304569843252,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999865103945867,1.3489605413342e-4,0.999999961737648,3.82623520644998e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18195,Quorum Sensing in Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi and Erwinia toletana: Role in Virulence and Interspecies Interactions in the Olive Knot.,"The olive knot disease (Olea europea L.) is caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi. P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi in the olive knot undergoes interspecies interactions with the harmless endophyte Erwinia toletana; P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi and E. toletana colocalize and form a stable community, resulting in a more aggressive disease. P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi and Etoletana produce the same type of the N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) quorum sensing (QS) signal, and they share AHLs in planta In this work, we have further studied the AHL QS systems of P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi and Etoletana in order to determine possible molecular mechanism(s) involved in this bacterial interspecies interaction/cooperation. The AHL QS regulons of P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi and Etoletana were determined, allowing the identification of several QS-regulated genes. Surprisingly, the P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi QS regulon consisted of only a few loci whereas in Etoletana many putative metabolic genes were regulated by QS, among which are several involved in carbohydrate metabolism. One of these loci was the aldolase-encoding gene garL, which was found to be essential for both colocalization of P. savastanoi pv. savastanoi and Etoletana cells inside olive knots as well as knot development. This study further highlighted that pathogens can cooperate with commensal members of the plant microbiome.IMPORTANCE This is a report on studies of the quorum sensing (QS) systems of the olive knot pathogen Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi and olive knot cooperator Erwinia toletana These two bacterial species form a stable community in the olive knot, share QS signals, and cooperate, resulting in a more aggressive disease.

20902,Impact of carbon-starved Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain IE-6S+ on the diversity of culturable fungi in the rhizosphere and within roots of mungbean,"Mungbean was grown repeatedly in sandy loam soil which was either left untreated (control) or was treated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain IE-6S + or its carbon-starved derivatives. Bacterial inoculants were applied to the soil at the start of each 52-day-long mungbean growth cycle and their effect on the diversity of the rhizosphere populations of cultureable fungi was assessed at the end of the first and fourth cycles. A total of 23 fungal species belonging to 18 genera were isolated from the rhizosphere of mungbean. There was a marked difference among the growth cycles with respect to fungal community composition; only slight differences occurred across the bacterial treatments. At fourth growth cycle, general diversity and equitability were lower in soils treated with wild type IE-6S+ while higher in those treated with IE-6S+PBK1 or IE-6S+KUC2. Following IE-6S+KUC2 treatment, fungal abundance pattern was described by geometric series while those following treatment with IE-6S+ or IE-6S+PBK1 were found to conform to MacArthur's broken-stick model at first growth cycle. Nine fungal species comprising 7 genera were found to colonize mungbean root tissues. Roots grown in untreated soils gave high colony forming units of the parasitic fungi while those treated with bacterial treatments harboured mostly saprotrophic fungi. When compared to the controls, general diversity, equitability and species richness of the culturable endophytic fungi were slightly higher in mungbean roots treated with the bacterial inoculants.

19130,Nutrient and mycoremediation of a global menace 'arsenic': exploring the prospects of phosphorus and Serendipita indica-based mitigation strategies in rice and other crops.,"Serendipita indica induced metabolic reprogramming in colonized plants complements phosphorus-management in improving their tolerance to arsenic stress on multifaceted biological fronts. Restoration of the anthropic damage done to our environment is inextricably linked to devising strategies that are not only economically sound but are self-renewing and ecologically conscious. The dilemma of heavy metal (HM) dietary ingestion, especially arsenic (As), faced by humans and animals alike, necessitates the exploitation of such technologies and the cultivation of healthy and abundant crops. The remarkable symbiotic alliance between plants and 'mycorrhizas' has evolved across eons, benefiting growth/yield aspects as well as imparting abiotic/biotic stress tolerance. The intricate interdependence of Serendipita indica (S. indica) and rice plant reportedly reduce As accumulation, accentuating the interest of microbiologists, agriculturists, and ecotoxicological scientists apropos of the remediation mechanisms of As in the soil-AMF-rice system. Nutrient management, particularly of phosphorus (P), is also praised for mitigating As phytotoxicity by deterring the uptake of As molecules due to the rhizospheric cationic competition. Taking into consideration the reasonable prospects of success in minimizing As acquisition by rice plants, this review focuses on the physiological, metabolic, and transcriptional alterations underlying S. indica symbiosis, recuperation of As stress together with nutritional management of P by gathering case studies and presenting successful paradigms. Weaving together a volume of literature, we assess the chemical forms of As and related transport pathways, discuss As-P-rice interaction and the significance of fungi in As toxicity mitigation, predominantly the role of mycorrhiza, as well as survey of the multifaceted impacts of S. indica on plants.

1084,Ergot Alkaloid Concentrations in High- and Low-Moisture Tall Fescue Silage,"Ergot alkaloids are mycotoxins found in foods and forage crops, including common tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh. = Schedonorus arundinaceus (Schreb.) Dumort.], which hosts a fungal endophyte. The objective of this study was to determine changes in ergovaline and total ergot alkaloid concentrations in tall fescue silage produced at high moisture (650 to 680 g H2O kg(-1)) and low moisture (340 to 400 g H2O kg(-1)). The study was conducted on endophyte-infected pastures of tall fescue in northern and southern Missouri. Tall fescue was clipped after seedhead emergence but before anthesis, wilted to high or low moisture, baled, and wrapped. After >100 d of ensiling, bales were cored and samples analyzed for ergovaline and total ergot alkaloid concentrations. Ergovaline concentration decreased (P < 0.05) during ensiling at both locations and moisture levels, and the decrease ranged from 24 to 58%. In contrast, total ergot alkaloid concentrations increased during ensiling in high moisture silage in northern (P < 0.10) and southern (P < 0.05) Missouri but did not change in low moisture silage. The opposing responses of ergovaline and total ergot alkaloids offer partial explanations for differences reported in studies involving tall fescue silage. These responses also caution against recommendations to ensile tall fescue to reduce toxins because one analyte indicates detoxification is possible, while the other analyte does not.","Roberts, CA; Davis, DK; Looper, ML; Kallenbach, RL; Rottinghaus, GE; Hill, NS",CROP SCIENCE,2014,10.2135/cropsci2013.05.0318,0.989219937655216,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992290873338947,0.00770912666105246,0.999997075643533,2.92435646664924e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12615,"Diversity and functional traits of indigenous soil microbial flora associated with salinity and heavy metal concentrations in agricultural fields within the Indus Basin region, Pakistan","Soil salinization and heavy metal (HM) contamination are major challenges facing agricultural systems worldwide. Determining how soil microbial communities respond to these stress factors and identifying individual phylotypes with potential to tolerate these conditions while promoting plant growth could help prevent negative impacts on crop productivity. This study used amplicon sequencing and several bioinformatic programs to characterize differences in the composition and potential functional capabilities of soil bacterial, fungal, and archaeal communities in five agricultural fields that varied in salinity and HM concentrations within the Indus basin region of Pakistan. The composition of bacteria with the potential to fix atmospheric nitrogen (N) and produce the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase were also determined. Microbial communities were dominated by: Euryarchaeota (archaea), Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetota, Firimicutes, Patescibacteria and Acidobacteria (bacteria), and Ascomycota (fungi), and all soils contained phylotypes capable of N-fixation and ACC-deaminase production. Salinity influenced bacterial, but not archaeal or fungal communities. Both salinity and HM altered the relative abundance of many phylotypes that could potentially promote or harm plant growth. These stress factors also appeared to influence the potential functional capabilities of the microbial communities, especially in their capacity to cycle phosphorous, produce siderophores, and act as symbiotrophs or pathotrophs. Results of this study confirm that farms in this region are at risk due to salinization and excessive levels of some toxic heavy metals, which could negatively impact crop and human health. Changes in soil microbial communities and their potential functional capabilities are also likely to affect several critical agroecosystem services related to nutrient cycling, pathogen suppression, and plant stress tolerance. Many potentially beneficial phylotypes were identified that appear to be salt and HM tolerant and could possibly be exploited to promote these services within this agroecosystem. Future efforts to isolate these phylotypes and determine whether they can indeed promote plant growth and/or carry out other important soil processes are recommended. At the same time, identifying ways to promote the abundance of these unique phylotypes either through modifying soil and crop management practices, or developing and applying them as inoculants, would be helpful for improving crop productivity in this region.","Marghoob, MU; Rodriguez-Sanchez, A; Imran, A; Mubeen, F; Hoagland, L",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2022,10.3389/fmicb.2022.1020175,0.943240536536148,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993712126667477,0.00628787333252266,0.999999986895676,1.31043236262229e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
17283,First Report of Alternaria tenuissima Causing Postharvest Decay on Apple Fruit from Cold Storage in the United States.,"Apples are grown and stored for 9 to 12 months under controlled atmosphere conditions in the United States. During storage, apples are susceptible to various fungal pathogens, including several Alternaria species (2). Alternaria tenuissima (Nees) Wiltshire causes dry core rot (DCR) on apples during storage and has recently occurred in South Africa (1). Losses range widely, but typically occur at 6 to 8% annually due to this disease (2). In February 2013, 'Nittany' apples with round, dark-colored, dry, spongy lesions were obtained from wooden bins in a commercial cold storage facility located in Pennsylvania. Symptomatic fruits were transported to the lab, rinsed with sterile water, and the lesions were sprayed with 70% ethanol until runoff and wiped dry. The skin was aseptically removed with a scalpel, and asymptomatic tissue was placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25°C. Two single-spore isolates were propagated on PDA and permanent cultures were maintained as slants and stored at 4°C. The fungus produced a cottony white mycelium that turned olive-green to brown with abundant aerial hyphae and had a dark brown to black reverse on PDA. Isolates were identified as Alternaria based on conidial morphology as the spores were slightly melanized and obclavate to obpyriform catentulate with longitudinal and transverse septa attached in unbranched chains on simple short conidiophores. Conidia ranged from 10 to 70 μm long (mean 27.7 μm) and 5 to 15 μm wide (mean 5.25 μm) (n = 50) with 1 to 6 transverse and 0 to 2 longitudinal septa. Conidial beaks, when present, were short (5 μm or less) and tapered. Mycelial genomic DNA was extracted, and a portion of the histone gene (357 bp) was amplified via gene specific primers (Alt-His3-F/R) using conventional PCR (Jurick II, unpublished). The forward and reverse sequences were assembled into a consensus representing 2× coverage and MegaBLAST analysis showed that both isolates were 100% identical to Alternaria tenuissima isolates including CR27 (GenBank Accession No. AF404622.1) that caused DCR on apple fruit during storage in South Africa. Koch's postulates were conducted using 10 organic 'Gala' apple fruit that were surface sterilized with soap and water, sprayed with 70% ethanol, and wiped dry. The fruit were aseptically wounded with a nail to a 3 mm depth, inoculated with 50 μl of a conidial suspension (1 × 104 conidia/ml), and stored at 25°C in 80 count boxes on paper trays for 21 days. Mean lesion diameters on inoculated 'Gala' apple fruit were 19.1 mm (±7.4), water only controls (n = 10 fruit) were symptomless, and the experiment was repeated. Symptoms observed on artificially inoculated 'Gala' apple fruit were similar to the decay observed on 'Nittany' apples from cold storage. Based on our findings, it is possible that A. tenuissima can cause decay that originates from wounded tissue in addition to dry core rot, which has been reported (1). Since A. tenuissima produces potent mycotoxins, even low levels of the pathogen could pose a health problem for contaminated fruit destined for processing and may impact export to other countries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of alternaria rot caused by A. tenuissima on apple fruit from cold storage in the United States. References: (1) J. C. Combrink et al. Decid.

17578,The evaluation of endophyte toxin residues in sheep fat.,"To monitor changes in concentrations of lolitrem B and epoxy-janthitrems in the fat of sheep grazing perennial ryegrass infected with wild-type- and AR37-endophyte, respectively, during the time of year when ryegrass staggers would be expected to be observed. Ten 5-month-old lambs with no previous exposure to endophytes were grazed on either wild-type (containing lolitrem B, n = 5) or AR37 (containing epoxy-janthitrems, n = 5) endophyte-infected perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) pastures between October 2008 and June 2009. Animals were regularly assessed for ryegrass staggers using the Keogh scale (0 = no signs, 5 = severe tremors). When a score of > 3.5 was observed animals were removed from the treatment pastures for 1 month. Fat biopsy samples were taken from each animal at approximately monthly intervals and analysed for endophyte metabolites using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods developed during this study. Regular herbage samples were also taken and concentrations of endophyte metabolites measured. Efficient and reproducible methods to analyse both lolitrem B and epoxy-janthitrems in fat were developed. Concentrations of lolitrem B and epoxy-janthitrems in herbage and in sheep fat increased from late November to peak in mid-February. Ryegrass staggers was observed in both groups of sheep at this time. Following 1 month of grazing non-infected pasture mean concentrations in fat of lolitrem B decreased by 43% from 61.8 to 35.3 ppb, and of epoxy-janthitrems by 38% from 1032.0 to 639.5 ppb. Maximum concentrations in herbage of epoxy-janthitrems (35.7 ppm) were higher than of lolitrem B (3.4 ppm), but signs of staggers were less severe in sheep grazing pasture containing the former compared with the latter (median Keogh scores in late February were 2 and 3, respectively), consistent with epoxy-janthitrems being low potency toxins. This study demonstrated that concentrations of epoxy-janthitrems and lolitrem B in sheep fat increased quickly during the initial phase of the study when concentrations in pasture increased, and decreased when animals were removed from pastures containing these compounds. These data will be used in the risk assessment of the endophyte metabolites.",Finch SC; Fletcher LR; Babu JV,New Zealand veterinary journal,2012,10.1080/00480169.2011.634746,0.855882435121805,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999236687707652,7.6331229234783e-4,0.999999970679933,2.93200674850169e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19439,Interaction networks reveal highly antagonistic endophytic bacteria in native maize seeds from traditional milpa agroecosystems.,"Milpas are traditional Mesoamerican agroecosystems maintained with ancestral practices. Maize landraces are grown in polyculture, creating highly productive and diverse ecosystems. Recent studies suggest that milpas maintain beneficial plant-microbe interactions that are probably absent in modern agroecosystems; however, direct comparisons of the microbiome of plants between traditional and modern agroecosystems are still needed. Here, we studied seed-endophytic bacterial communities from native maize landraces from milpas and hybrid varieties. First, we quantified the abundance of culturable endophytic microbes; next, we assessed pairwise antagonistic interaction networks between bacterial isolates; finally, we compared bacterial community structure by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We found that seeds from native maize landraces harbour a higher endophytic microbial load, including more bacterial strains with antagonistic activity against soil-borne bacteria, and overall harbour more diverse bacterial communities than the hybrid varieties. Noteworthy, most of the seed-endophytic strains with antagonistic activity corresponded to Burkholderia spp. that were only found in native maize seeds, through both culture-dependent and independent strategies. Altogether, our results support that crop modernization alters the functions and structure of plant-associated microbes; we propose native maize from milpas could serve as a model for understanding plant-microbe interactions and the effect of modernization.",Gastélum G; Aguirre-von-Wobeser E; de la Torre M; Rocha J,Environmental microbiology,2022,10.1111/1462-2920.16189,0.982528327202553,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.882661734061098,0.117338265938902,0.99998759811547,1.2401884530111e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

12462,Occurrence of the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum in leaf blades of tall fescue and implications for stock health,"Leaf blades of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) plants infected with the endophytic fungus Neotyphodium coenophialum (= Acremonium coenophialum) have often been assumed to be endophyte-free. However, fungal colonies identified as N. coenophialum developed following incubation of surface-sterilised leaf blades from endophyte-infected tall fescues on antibiotic potato dextrose agar. A standardised fungal isolation technique was developed to assess the distribution of hyphae within tall fescue leaf blades in three USA-bred cultivars ('Georgia 5', 'Kentucky 31', 'Jesup') and a roadside population (MRSP) from the Manawatu region, New Zealand. Leaf blades of the three USA-bred cultivars were typically sparsely colonised. In contrast, extensively colonised leaf blades were present in many MRSP plants, particularly in autumn. Ergovaline concentrations of up to 3.9 ppm (mean 2.5) were present in leaf blades of the MRSP grown in a glasshouse. Ergovaline at lower concentrations (mean 0.4 ppm) was also detected in leaf blades of the tall fescue cultivars infected with their natural endophytes. These unusually high concentrations of hyphae and ergovaline observed within leaf blades of the MRSP provide an explanation of why fescue toxicosis has been especially severe in New Zealand. Significantly, N. coenophialum from plants of the MRSP was not uniform in cultural characteristics and conidial length, or in the ability to colonise leaf blades and produce ergovaline in artificially infected plants of four diverse tall fescue cultivars. The four inoculated cultivars ('Georgia 5', 'Grasslands Roa', 'Kentucky 31', 'KFa949') also differed in their interaction with N, coenophialum from MRSP. The most colonised leaf blades were in plants from an experimental cultivar of Mediterranean origin (KFa949), and, surprisingly, ergovaline concentrations were higher in the leaf blades than sheath. The New Zealand-bred tall fescue cultivar 'Grasslands Roa' was also distinctive in that no hyphae were detected in leaf blades. The concentration of ergovaline present in pooled leaf blades of 'Grasslands Roa' plants was lower than in those of the other naturally and artificially infected tall fescue/N. coenophialum populationsexamined in this study, reflecting the apparently low concentrations of hyphae present.","Christensen, MJ; Easton, HS; Simpson, WR; Tapper, BA",NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,1998,10.1080/00288233.1998.9513343,0.975679784438655,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.898451225831767,0.101548774168233,0.999999550890161,4.49109839206763e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

17193,First Report of Penicillium crustosum Causing Blue Mold on Stored Apple Fruit in Serbia.,"Penicillium crustosum Thom (1930) causes blue mold on pome fruits and is also regularly found on cheese, nuts, and soil (1,3). The fungus produces a wide range of mycotoxins such as penitrem A, roquefortine C, terrestric acid, and cyclopenol, which impact human health (1). In January and February 2013, 20 decayed apples, 'Golden Delicious' and 'Jonagold' (Malus × domestica Borkh.) with blue mold symptoms were collected from cold storages in Svilajnac and Bela Crkva, Serbia. Decayed areas were light to medium brown with blue green sporulation on the surface of the lesion. Decayed tissue was soft and watery with a sharp margin between the diseased and healthy areas. One isolate from each cultivar was designated JP2 ('Golden Delicious') and JBC7 ('Jonagold') and further characterized. Conidiophores of both isolates were terverticillate, stipes were septate with rough walls, and phialides were ampulliform. Conidia were smooth, borne in columns, and were spherical to subglobose. Conidial dimensions for JP2 were 3.2 to 4.56 (3.73) × 2.64 to 4.3 (3.32) μm and for JBC7 were 3.1 to 4.46 (3.65) × 2.81 to 4.27 (3.31) μm (n = 50). The isolates were cultured on Czapek yeast autolysate agar (CYA), malt extract agar (MEA), and yeast extract sucrose agar (YES) media and incubated at 25°C for 7 days. Mycelia were white with heavy sporulation yielding grayish green colonies on all media. Colonies were radially sulcate and velutinous, with clear exudate, and produced a yellow to orange reverse on CYA and YES. On MEA, colonies were plane, low, and mycelia subsurface with conidia having a dry powdery appearance. Crusts of conidial masses formed after 10 or more days. No growth was observed on CYA when these isolates were incubated at 37°C. Both isolates were identified as P. crustosum Thom using morphological characters according to (2) and (1). Species level identification was confirmed by isolating genomic DNA followed by amplification of the β-tubulin locus using gene specific primers via conventional PCR (4). MegaBLAST analysis of the 2X consensus nucleotide sequences revealed that JP2 and JBC7 (GenBank KJ433984 and 85) were 99% identical to P. crustosum culture collection isolate IBT 21518 (JN112030.1). Koch's postulates were examined using two apple cvs. Idared and Kolacara. Ten fruit per cultivar per isolate were inoculated on two sides of each fruit; 20 fruit were used as water-only inoculated controls. Fruit were washed with soap and water, surface sanitized with 70% ethanol, and placed into polyethylene boxes. Using a finishing nail, 4-mm wounds were created and inoculated with 50 μl of a 3 × 105/ml conidial suspension or Tween-treated sterile distilled water. Boxes with inoculated and control fruit were stored at 25°C for 10 days. The inoculated fruit developed small, soft, watery lesions, which enlarged into decayed areas with defined edges and abundant sporulation on the surface. Symptoms were identical to the original ones, while the control fruit remained symptomless. The fungus was re-isolated from infected tissue and showed the same morphological characteristics as the original isolates, thus completing Koch's postulates. Blue mold occurs during long term storage of apples and is predominantly caused by P. expansum. This is the first report of P. crustosum causing postharvest blue mold decay on apple fruit obtained from storage in Serbia and indicates that P. crustosum is an emerging pathogen for the Serbian pome fruit growing and packing industry.

17302,"Cohnella rhizosphaerae sp. nov., isolated from the rhizosphere environment of Zea mays.","A Gram-staining-positive, aerobic, non-endospore forming organism, isolated as a seed endophyte (colonizing the internal healthy tissue of plant seed) of sweet corn (Zea mays), strain CSE-5610T, was studied for its taxonomic allocation. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons, strain CSE-5610T was grouped into the genus Cohnella, most closely related to Cohnella ginsengisoli GR21-5T (98.1%) and 'Cohnella plantaginis' YN-83 (97.5%). The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to other members of the genus Cohnella was <96.6%. DNA-DNA hybridization of strain CSE-5610T with C. ginsengisoli DSM 18997T and 'C. plantaginis' DSM 25424 was 58% (reciprocal 24%) and 30% (reciprocal 27%), respectively. The fatty acid profile from whole cell hydrolysates supported the allocation of the strain to the genus Cohnella; iso- and anteiso-branched fatty acids were found as major compounds. meso-Diaminopimelic acid was identified as the cell-wall diamino acid. The quinone system consisted predominantly of menaquinone MK-7. The polar lipid profile was composed of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, two aminophospholipids, a phospholipid and minor amounts of two polar lipids. In the polyamine pattern, spermidine was the major polyamine. The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 60 mol%. In addition, the results of physiological and biochemical tests also allowed phenotypic differentiation of strain CSE-5610T from the two closely related strains. Hence, CSE-5610T represents a novel species of the genus Cohnella, for which we propose the name Cohnella rhizosphaerae sp. nov., with CSE-5610T (=LMG 28080T=CIP 110695T) as the type strain.",Kämpfer P; Glaeser SP; McInroy JA; Busse HJ,International journal of systematic and evolutionary microbiology,2014,10.1099/ijs.0.060814-0,0.919456972443768,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.562119619202824,0.437880380797176,0.999848566536208,1.5143346379242e-4,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

The antagonistic interaction between Diaporthe sp. and P. infestans was evaluated in three different culture media. Diaporthe sp. showed an antagonistic effect towards P. infestans, with some variation depending on which medium was used. in an attempt to identify possible genes involved in this antagonism, we detected a gene from the endophyte encoding an amylase, which was differentially expressed during this biotic interaction.

12364,Distribution of a Foliage Disease Fungus Within Canopies of Mature Douglas-Fir in Western Oregon,"Nothophaeocryptopus gaeumannii is a common native, endophytic fungus of Douglas-fir foliage, which causes Swiss needle cast, an important foliage disease that is considered a threat to Douglas-fir plantations in Oregon. Disease expression is influenced by fungal fruiting bodies (pseudothecia), which plug the stomata and inhibit gas exchange. Trees are impacted when pseudothecia plug stomates on 1-year-old and older needles resulting in early needle abscission. Mature (100 years+) trees appear to be less impacted from disease, and we hypothesize this is due to the greater emergence of pseudothecia on older than younger needles, which allows for more needle retention. We measured the density of pseudothecia occluding stomates across 2- to 5-year-old needles from upper, middle, and lower canopy positions of mature trees at three sites in the Oregon Coast Range and two sites in the western Oregon Cascade Mountains. Binomial generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) was used to test for the effects of canopy position (upper, middle, and lower), sites, needle age (2-5 years old), and years (2016 and 2017), and their interactions on the pseudothecia density. Pseudothecia density varied annually depending on sites, needle age and canopy positions. Pseudothecia density peaked on 3-, and 4-year-old needles, however, needles emerging from the same year, like 2-year-old needles in 2016 and 3-year-old needles in 2017 both emerged in 2014, had consistently similar patterns of pseudothecia density for both years, across site and canopy positions. Canopy position was important for 3-, and 4-year-old needles, showing less pseudothecia in the lower canopy. This research confirms that N. gaeumannii pseudothecia density is greatest in 3- and 4-year old needles in mature trees in contrast to plantations where pseudothecia density usually peaks on 2-year-old needles, and that pseudothecia density (disease severity) is generally lower in mature trees. Something about mature forest canopies and foliage appears to increase the time it takes for pseudothecia to emerge from the needles, in contrast to younger plantations, thus allowing the mature trees to have greater needle retention.","Lan, YH; Shaw, DC; Lee, EH; Beedlow, PA",FRONTIERS IN FORESTS AND GLOBAL CHANGE,2022,10.3389/ffgc.2022.743039,0.949138152732984,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.976187739836743,0.0238122601632573,0.99999904323633,9.56763669512917e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

By optimizing different parameters, isolated strain resulted in the hydroxylation of D-limonene to carveol effectively and the process was carried out at 1 L scale which resulted in the formation of a mixture of carveol isomers (cis- carveol 23.82%, trans- carveol 17.21%). Further, the biotransformation was scaled up in 5 L fermenter and the product was characterized by GC-MS and NMR (H-1 & C-13).

4770,"Redefining common endophytes and plant pathogens in Neofabraea, Pezicula, and related genera","Species in Neofabraea, Pezicula, and related genera have been reported as saprobes, plant pathogens or endophytes from a wide range of hosts. The asexual morphs of Neofabraea and Pezicula had been placed in Cryptosporiopsis, now a synonym of Pezicula, while Neofabraea was also linked to Phlyctema. Based on morphology and molecular data of the partial large subunit nrDNA (LSU), the internal transcribed spacer region with intervening 5.8S nrDNA (ITS), partial beta-tubulin region (tub2), and the partial RNA polymerase II second largest subunit region (rpb2), the taxonomy and phylogenetic relationships of these fungi were investigated. Five new species were described in Pezicula based on morphology, while a further eight unnamed phylogenetic lineages revealed further diversity in the genus. Based on these results, the generic concept of Neofabraea was also emended. Phlyctema, which was previously associated with Neofabraea, formed a distinct Glade, separate from Neofabraea s. str. Two new neofabraea-like genera, Parafabraea and Pseudofabraea were proposed, along with one new combination in Neofabraea s. str. To stabilise the application of these names, an epitype was designated for Pe. carpinea, the type species of Pezicula, and for N. malicorticis, the type species of Neofabraea.

7997,Camptothecine production by mixed fermentation of two endophytic fungi from Nothapodytes nimmoniana,"Two endophytic fungi isolated from the endangered plant Nothapodytes nimmoniana (Grah.) Mabb. were found to effectively synthesize CPT independent of their host plant under submerged fermentation conditions. Molecular characterization of fungi revealed their identity as Colletotrichum fructicola SUK1 (F1) and Corynespora cassiicola SUK2 (F2). Mixed fermentation experiments were carried out to study the effect of microbial signalling between the two fungal species on camptothecine production. Effect of culture parameters on CPT production was studied for both mono-cultures (F1 and F2) separately as well as for the mixed fermentation (F1 + F2). Further the most influencing ones were optimized statistically using response surface methodology. Statistical model based optimized parameters were whey (70 %), agitation rate (110 rpm), temperature (30 degrees C), and incubation period (7 d) for the mixed fermentation. Monocultures of the two fungal species El and F2 yielded CPT up to 33 +/- 1.1 mg1(-1) riand 69 +/- 1.1 mg 1(-1), respectively; while their mixed fermentation under the optimized conditions yielded up to 146 +/- 0.2 mg 1(-1).

6896,Assessing risk factors for systemic fungal infections,"The incidence of invasive fungal infection has increased in recent years. Most infections are caused by Candida albicans and Aspergillus spp. but the emergence of other fungal infections is changing the spectrum of disease. Immunosuppression and breakdown of anatomical barriers such as the skin are the major risk factors for fungal infections. Health care workers encounter at-risk patients in various settings, including AIDS clinics and intensive care, transplantation and oncology units. Patients with prolonged and deep neutropenia (haematological malignancy patients) are most at risk and are therefore most likely to receive prophylactic therapy. Practical measures can be taken to avoid exposing the patient to fungi (air filtration, regular hand washing, avoiding plants and flowers) and antifungal agents can be administered to prevent systemic fungal infection. Most fungal infections have non-specific symptoms; this makes recognition of the signs and symptoms of the disease important but also makes diagnosis difficult and empirical treatment necessary. Some antifungal agents have Limitations but new formulations will improve therapy and play a key role in future antifungal strategies.","Maertens, J; Vrebos, M; Boogaerts, M",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER CARE,2001,10.1046/j.1365-2354.2001.00241.x,0.951801064750031,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992973543955567,0.00702645604443279,0.99999999996553,3.44702044685619e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Endophyte from the specific medicinal plants produce the analogous metabolites as that of the host plant. The metabolites from the endophytes comprise maximum therapeutic properties and have been extensively applied in treating various diseases and disorders. This study was focused on identification of the endophytic fungi from the medicinal plant Blumea axillaris and investigates the diversity of endophytic fungi from various explants of the same plant. The explants were cultured on potato dextrose agar and 6 endophytic fungi were successfully isolated from Blumea axillaris. They were identified morphologically and confirmed with molecular analysis as Xylaria arbuscula, Paraphoma radicina, Phomopsis phaseoli, Sordaria fimicola, Aspergillus amstelodami, Diaporthe eucalyptorum. The DNA sequences were analyzed by BLAST and the phylogenetic tree was constructed with neighbor joining method. The six isolates were subjected to antagonistic activity for the selection of potential strain and the bioactive strain Xylaria arbuscula was selected for the production of secondary metabolites by optimization. The parameters like pH, temperature, incubation period, carbon and nitrogen (organic and inorganic source) were optimized for secondary metabolite production. The fungal metabolite was extracted by solvent extraction method using polar and non-polar solvents like propanol, methanol, chloroform, acetone and ethyl acetate.

16846,First Report of Dry Rot Caused by Fusarium oxysporum on Rose (Rosa spp.) in Brazil.,"Roses are a high-value niche crop in the higher altitudes of northeastern Brazil. From July of 2007 and throughout 2008, severe stem rot and wilting of rose seedlings were observed in commercial fields in the São Benedito District, Ceará State, Brazil. Although economic losses due to the disease are unknown, it poses a threat to the growing rose industry in that region. Symptoms included leaf yellowing and abscission followed by plant collapse. Symptoms appeared earlier when grafted seedlings were produced during periods of high relative humidity (80 to 98%) and warm temperatures (20 to 31°C). In the laboratory, symptomatic seedlings were rinsed with distilled water, surface sterilized with 0.5% NaOCl, and incubated on PDA at 26 ± 2°C. Fusarium oxysporum was consistently isolated from infected scions and rootstocks. Identification of F. oxysporum was based on colony and conidia morphology obtained from single-spore colonies. Five 4-week-old rose ('Carola') seedlings were inoculated with a culture of fungus by spraying the needle-wounded scion with a spore suspension (1 × 105 CFU/ml). The spore suspension was obtained from a 1-week-old PDA culture incubated at 26 ± 2°C. Control seedlings were sprayed with sterile water. Inoculated seedlings were incubated for the first 48 h in a saturated humidity chamber. After 20 days at room temperature, the scion tissue of inoculated seedlings turned necrotic. Two symptomatic seedlings were placed in a saturated humidity chamber for 24 h to determine if fungal sporulation could be observed on the surface of the tissue. After 5 to 7 days, a white mycelium was observed over the necrotic tissue. Seedlings sprayed with sterile water remained symptomless. F. oxysporum was reisolated from symptomatic tissue. An isolate of F. oxyporum (No. 1484) was deposited in the Mycology Collection of Lavras (Minas Gerais State, Brazil).

8496,"Cinnamic acid as an inhibitor of growth, flavonoids exudation and endophytic fungus colonization in maize root","Cinnamic acid (CA) is an allelochemical that inhibits the growth of root promoting soil microorganisms. To prevent the growth of soil microbes, CA modulates several metabolic pathways in host plants and soil microbes. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect of CA on maize root growth, exudation of secondary metabolites and its interaction with beneficial endophyte Pz11. The endophyte Pz11 was isolated from the roots of drought stressed Asphodelus tenuifolius (wild onion). The Pz11 strain was identified as Fusarium culmorum by homology of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of 18 S rDNA sequence. The F. culmorum Pz11 produced phytostimulants and signaling compounds, such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), flavonoids and sugars. Moreover, the strain have effectively colonized the roots of maize and subsequently enhanced the growth of its host plants. On the contrary, application of CA has reduced root growth in maize seedlings as well as root colonization ability of F. culmorum Pz11. Also, maize seedlings exposed to CA exude low quantities of flavonoids and polyphenols. In conclusion, CA reduces the maize root growth and exudation of secondary metabolites, which may affects its ability to attract plant growth promoting endophytic fungi.","Mehmood, A; Hussain, A; Irshad, M; Hamayun, M; Iqbal, A; Rahman, H; Tawab, A; Ahmad, A; Ayaz, S",PLANT PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY,2019,10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.11.029,0.991339496521682,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985606073449054,0.0143939265509456,0.999985389295983,1.46107040173149e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
14234,EXPLORATION AND SCREENING FOR ENDOPHYTIC MICROBES OF MAIZE PLANT ROOT AGAINST Fusarium verticillioides; [Eksplorasi dan skrining mikroba endofit perakaran tanaman jagung terhadap Fusarium verticillioides.],"Fusarium verticilloides is an important pathogen of maize which can attack cob and stem causing ear rot and stalk rot disease. Fusarium ear rot disease needs to get a serious attention because the mycotoxins produced by this pathogen very harmful for consumers. The aim of this study was to screen maize roots endophytic microbes as antagonist to F. verticilloides. Endophytes microbial exploration is done by taking samples of local roots of South Sulawesi and hybrid maizes in Soppeng Regency then isolated in Biological Laboratory of Islamic University of Makassar. The endophytes were then tested their effectiveness on inhibiting growth of mycelia pathogenic F. verticilloides by using dual culture method and tested the suppressing ability of F. verticilloides on maize seed and their influence on seed sprout length. The results showed that there were 8 endophytic microbes consisting of 4 isolates of the fungus group namely HS-01, HS-02, HS-04, LS-01 and 4 isolates from bacterial group namely HS-03, LS-02, LS-03, LS-04. While the results of microbial effectiveness testing on pathogenic F. verticilloides showed that HS-04 has the highest percentage of inhibition followed by isolate HS-01, HS-02 and LS-02. HS-04 isolate also showed the ability to suppress F. verticilloides attacks on corn seeds at 77.78%. The highest seed sprout length was shown in LS-02 isolate application about 10.57 cm. Thus it can be concluded that there were 3 potentially endophytic microbes to control the F. verticilloides namely HS-04, HS-01 and LS-02. The ability to stimulate plant growth became one of considerations to select these three microbes. © 2018, University of Lampung Faculty of Agriculture.

4472,Evidence for subdivision of the root-endophyte Phialocephala fortinii into cryptic species and recombination within species,"The genetic structure of the root-endophyte Phialocephala fortinii was analyzed in three study sites using I I single-copy RFLP probes. A total of 541 strains isolated from surface-sterilized, fine roots (diameter 0.5-3 mm) of Norway spruce (Picea abies) were examined. The average gene diversity (H) was high in all three study sites. Cluster analysis showed that up to four well-separated clusters of multi-locus haplotypes were present within the sites. Significant population subdivision was detected among these clusters, suggesting that groups of multi-locus haplotypes were reproductively isolated and that P. fortinii is a species complex composed of several cryptic species. This hypothesis was supported by ISSR-PCR which showed clusters consistent with those of the multi-locus haplotypes identified by RFLP analysis. In contrast, ITS sequence analysis did not allow to separate the species as clearly. The index of association (I-A) did not deviate significantly from zero within any cryptic species, suggesting that recombination occurs within these species. Cryptic species occurred sympatrically. Thalli of two cryptic species were detected in the same 5-mm-long root segment in one instance. No significant differentiation was observed among populations of the same cryptic species in forest stands located approximately 5 km from each other. This finding is consistent with significant gene flow over this spatial scale. In addition, several isolates with both identical multi-locus haplotype and identical ISSR fingerprint were found at each study site indicating genotype flow or a recent common history between study sites.

12267,Baseline and non-baseline sensitivity of Magnaporthe oryzae isolates from perennial ryegrass to azoxystrobin in the northeastern United States,"Gray leaf spot, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae, is chiefly managed by the application of fungicides. Among several systemic fungicides, azoxystrobin has been effectively used to control the disease; however, the development of resistance in M. oryzae to azoxystrobin has been reported in some regions of the United States. The sensitivity level to azoxystrobin of pathogen isolates from perennial ryegrass turf has not been documented in it comprehensive manner in the northeastern United States. This survey was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity to azoxystrobin of 135 isolates of M. oryzae collected between 1995 and 2004 from golf Courses primarily in the northeastern United States. Media components, incubation time, and temperature were optimized for a modified in vitro spore germination assay to determine the sensitivity of the isolates. The EC50 value of 111 baseline isolates ranged from 0.001 to 0.083 mu g/mL (mean 0.039 mu g/mL) and 21 non-baseline isolates from Pennsylvania (PA) ranged front 0.007 to 0.066 mu g/mL (mean 0.029 mu g/mL). No significant difference in sensitivity (P <= 0.05) was observed between baseline and PA non-baseline isolates.

6127,Synthesis and therapeutic potential of copper oxide nanoparticles from endophytic fungi: anti-cancer activities and mechanisms,"Copper Oxide Nanoparticles (CuONPs) contain medicinal properties and are an essential component of the next generation due to their unique properties. CuONPs have a vital role in therapeutics, especially for cancer treatment. This study's main focus was synthesizing the CuONPs and assessing the anti-cancer activity, including the in vitro anti-angiogenesis and cytotoxicity analyses. CuONPs are synthesized using the enzymatic suspension of endophytic fungal strains FCSRL3 and FCPRS11 isolated from the Azadirachta indica grown in a minimal medium at optimum pH 7.2. About 14 different endophytic fungi confined from the neem tree, and the antagonistic and antioxidant properties were evaluated. The efficient FCSRL3 and FCPRS11 were identified as Aspergillus sydowi and Aspergillus versicolor at a molecular level. The synthesized CuONPs from two fungi were confirmed through characterization determination using SEM, EDAX, FT-IR, and XRD analyses. CuONPs revealed maximum antibacterial, antimycotic, and antioxidant activities at minimum concentration, exerting the highest bioactive properties. The anti-angiogenic activity of the CuONPs from two different fungal strains exhibited maximum inhibition of blood vessels in chick embryos, and the assessment was performed using HET-CAM. The outcomes of this research demonstrate the notable role of CuONPs in cancer remedies.","Radhakrishnan, S; Balasubramanian, B; Kavibharath, S; Thangaraj, N; Paramasivam, D; Kamyab, H; Mani, VM; Chelliapan, S; Khalili, E",BIOORGANIC CHEMISTRY,2025,10.1016/j.bioorg.2025.108679,0.564966172762139,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.867736556741379,0.132263443258621,0.99999863840143,1.36159856956031e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
5248,"Genome Mining and Evaluation of the Biocontrol Potential of Pseudomonas fluorescens BRZ63, a New Endophyte of Oilseed Rape (Brassica napus L.) against Fungal Pathogens","Endophytic bacteria hold tremendous potential for use as biocontrol agents. Our study aimed to investigate the biocontrol activity of Pseudomonas fluorescens BRZ63, a new endophyte of oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) against Rhizoctonia solani W70, Colletotrichum dematium K, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum K2291, and Fusarium avenaceum. In addition, features crucial for biocontrol, plant growth promotion, and colonization were assessed and linked with the genome sequences. The in vitro tests showed that BRZ63 significantly inhibited the mycelium growth of all tested pathogens and stimulated germination and growth of oilseed rape seedlings treated with fungal pathogens. The BRZ63 strain can benefit plants by producing biosurfactants, siderophores, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, and ammonia as well as phosphate solubilization. The abilities of exopolysaccharide production, autoaggregation, and biofilm formation additionally underline its potential to plant colonization and hence biocontrol. The effective colonization properties of the BRZ63 strain were confirmed by microscopy observations of EGFP-expressing cells colonizing the root surface and epidermal cells of Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0. Genome mining identified many genes related to the biocontrol process, such as transporters, siderophores, and other secondary metabolites. All analyses revealed that the BRZ63 strain is an excellent endophytic candidate for biocontrol of various plant pathogens and plant growth promotion.","Chlebek, D; Pinski, A; Zur, J; Michalska, J; Hupert-Kocurek, K",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES,2020,10.3390/ijms21228740,0.99066927149137,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.738286520452189,0.261713479547811,0.999997664620528,2.33537947191831e-6,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
11893,Mycobiota Associated with Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Fraxinus excelsior in Post-Dieback Forest Stands,"In Lithuania, the dieback of European ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), caused by alien ascomycete Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, started in the mid-1990s, resulting in a large-scale decline of F. excelsior and its dominated forest habitats. Nevertheless, the recent inventories show the presence of several hundred hectares of naturally regenerated F. excelsior stands. We used seven naturally regenerated sites and three planted progeny trials of F. excelsior to collect leaves, shoots, roots, and the surrounding soil to study ash-associated fungal communities based on high-throughput sequencing. Results showed that fungal communities associated with F. excelsior in re-emerging stands in post-dieback areas were composed of 1487 fungal taxa. Among these, 60.5% were Ascomycota, 37.5%-Basidiomycota, 1.7%-Zygomycota, and 0.2% were Chytridiomycota. Revealed mycobiota was largely composed of endophytic fungal communities as these were dominated by Cladosporium sp., Fraxinicola fraxini (syn. Venturia fraxini) and Vishniacozyma foliicola. Identified mycobiota also included a range of ash-specific fungal taxa. Hymenoscyphus fraxineus occurred in all stands but was not frequent. Cladosporium sp. showed strongest negative correlation with the presence of H. fraxineus. This ascomycete, given its dominance in leaves, shoots and in the organic soil layer, might be the limiting factor for the infection rate or spread of H. fraxineus. Although fungal communities in asymptomatic and symptomatic samples of F. excelsior differed significantly from each other, the majority of the most frequently found fungal taxa were not host-specific, suggesting that these were negligibly affected by ash dieback. Investigated stands in natural F. excelsior habitats exhibited larger diversity of fungal taxa (especially ash-specific), than progeny trials planted on former grasslands, indicating the importance of natural habitats in F. excelsior restoration programs.","Bakys, R; Pliura, A; Bajerkeviciene, G; Marciulynas, A; Marciulyniene, D; Lynikiene, J; Menkis, A",FORESTS,2022,10.3390/f13101609,0.67871724980587,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993457322304064,0.00654267769593571,0.999999869071165,1.30928834773947e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

Experimental trials were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments based on non-pathogenic endophytes isolated from asymptomatic grapevines growing in vineyards with high incidence of crown gall and on microorganisms isolated from commercial products. Two-year in planta trials conducted on rootstocks treated with endophytic isolates showed the effectiveness of two bacterial endophytes, both in the genus Curtobacterium, and one fungal isolate in the genus Acremonium in reducing crown gall development. For the commercial biological control agents, Bacillus subtilis SR63 and Trichoderma asperellum T1 were the most effective strains against A. vitis, indicating commercial products could be reserves to draw upon to identify useful biocontrol agents. Based on the combination of data in this work, microorganisms, both endophytes and those formulated in commercial products, were identified that can potentially be exploited for the control of grapevine crown gall disease.","Ferrigo, D; Causin, R; Raiola, A",BIOCONTROL,2017,10.1007/s10526-017-9847-3,0.891445393108977,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990850392176554,0.0091496078234457,0.999999996756674,3.2433260521713704e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
20508,Antagonistic effects of fosetyl-Al and ethylene on peroxidase from grapevine cells,"Grapevine (Vitis vinifera cv. 'Monastrell') suspension cell cultures treated with 1.5 mnol/l fosetyl-Al a frequently used systemic fungicide to control grapevine diseases caused by oomycetes, showed a reduction in the level of peroxidase activity secreted into the culture medium compared to non-treated cells. This effect was increased when the inhibitor of ethylene synthesis, aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG), and the inhibitor of ethylene action, norborna-2,5-dien (NBD), were added to the culture medium. Since the effect of fosetyl-Al on peroxidase is, furthermore, partially reversed by the ethylene-evolving compound, ethephon, fosetyl-Al appears to be an antagonist of the effect of ethylene on peroxidase from grapevine cells. In fact, peroxidase activity in grapevine cells is controlled by ethylene since inoculations with the ethylene-forming-enzyme (EFE) inhibitor, Co2+ ion, reduce peroxidase activity in the culture medium. These results suggest that the reduction in peroxidase activity provoked by fosetyl-Al in grapevine cells appears to be part of an defense mechanism that disturbs the post-parasite interaction through lowering the activity of all active oxygen species-detoxifying enzyme, which in the healthy plant cell is controlled by ethylene.","LopezSerrano, M; Ferrer, MA; Munoz, R; Pedreno, MA; Barcelo, AR",ZEITSCHRIFT FUR PFLANZENKRANKHEITEN UND PFLANZENSCHUTZ-JOURNAL OF PLANT DISEASES AND PROTECTION,1996,NA,0.76341857435723,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.87010362220956,0.12989637779044,0.999996062847598,3.93715240154524e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

Two types of axenic culture of different origin were obtained. Type 1 was developed from apices of A. nodosum collected in the sea. Type 2 was from plants which developed from adventitious embryos on rhizoids formed by type 1. This is the first time A. nodosum has been cultivated axenically. Growth of the axenic alga was increased by IAA, 2IP and zeatin. Without external growth regulators some strains of the axenic alga deteriorated within a year; others developed a filamentous habit. Sulfur in a reduced state also stimulated growth. Addition of either glucose, mannose or mannitol to the medium caused the formation of callus-like layers of loosely packed colorless cells under the epidermis of the thalli and the epidermis was sloughed off. No increase in thallus length was noticed. Mycosphaerella ascophylli in axenic culture did not exclude any substances stimulating growth of the alga, but that does not exclude an influence of the fungus on the alga in vivo. The fungus, when growing within the alga, seemed to have little influence on algal morphology. A bacterized but fungus-free A. nodosum was cultivated in an artificial seawater for 8 years. In the bacteria-free alga, the fungus protruded from the epidermis of evidently utilized the alga as a carbon source. The bacteria thus seem much more important that the fungus for normal growth of the Ascophyllum plant.","FRIES, L",JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY,1988,10.1111/j.1529-8817.1988.tb00182.x,0.529226718922725,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998763269728946,0.00123673027105413,0.999999999513848,4.86152118561733e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
10610,Impact of a natural soil salinity gradient on fungal endophytes in wild barley (Hordeum maritimum With.),"Occurrence and distribution pattern of fungal endophytes in different tissues of halophytic plants across saline depressions are poorly studied. We investigated the endophytic fungal communities inhabiting roots, stems and leaves of Hordeum maritimum collected in a soil salinity gradient, i. e. non-saline, slightly saline and saline, using a culture-dependent approach. A total of 20 taxa belonging to Ascomycota phylum were identified by ITS rRNA gene sequence. Pyronema domesticum and Alternaria spp. were the most frequently isolated. Roots host higher diversity and were more frequently colonized by endophytes than aboveground organs. Endophytic composition of all organs surveyed differed according to salinity gradient. Contrary to expectations, the colonization rate of roots increased with soil salinity, indicating that under salt stress the endophyte-plant association is promoted. All the isolates exhibited in vitro saline tolerance, especially those belonging to genera Xylaria, Chalastospora, Alternaria and Pyronema. Fungal tolerance to NaCl under in vitro conditions appears to be more dependent on the isolates than on the sites of their isolation, suggesting that under natural conditions other factors, beyond soil salinity, should be taken into account. These findings highlight the importance of fungal endophytes in the protection and/ or adaptation of both interacting species ( plant-fungus) to salt stress under natural conditions.","Hammami, H; Baptista, P; Martins, F; Gomes, T; Abdelly, C; Metoui-Ben Mahmoud, O",WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY,2016,10.1007/s11274-016-2142-0,0.97503790347127,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.603387795273848,0.396612204726152,0.999998545879295,1.45412070495787e-6,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

2077,Control of pathogenic PAC strains by non-pathogenic PAC strains in planta does not correlate with higher competitiveness of non-pathogenic PAC strains ex planta,"Ascomycetes of the Phialocephala fortinii s.l.-Acephala applanata species complex (PAC) are frequent root endophytes of forest trees. Roots are colonized by multiple PAC genotypes that interact, and recent findings indicate that adverse effects on plant performance caused by pathogenic PAC strains are attenuated by non-pathogenic PAC strains. However, it was not known if this ""self-control"" works only in planta, or also ex planta, i.e., prior to infection during saprotrophic life of the PAC. Interactions between PAC strains were therefore studied in a plant-free system on malt extract agar. The mycelia of two pathogenic (A and T1) and two non-pathogenic (B and C) PAC strains were mixed pairwise 5:1, 1:1 and 1:5 (fresh weight ratios) and incubated at 15 and 25 A degrees C. Mycelial biomass of each strain was measured after 2 and 8 weeks. The combination of strains and the mixture ratio had a significant effect on strain biomass, whereas temperature influenced only the biomass of pathogenic strain T1. Biomass production of strain T1 was inhibited by all other strains, whereas biomass production of the other pathogenic strain A was significantly stimulated by the two non-pathogenic strains. This contrasts strongly with results from a previous experiment in planta using strains A, B and C, because the two non-pathogenic PAC strains successfully inhibited the pathogenic strain, probably by space occupation or the induction of host resistance. Therefore, it is impossible to predict the outcome of PAC-PAC interactions in planta based on the results gained from interactions ex planta.","Hugentobler, I; Reininger, V; Sieber, TN",MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS,2014,10.1007/s11557-014-0986-y,0.974898332605739,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999730082130491,2.6991786950898e-4,0.999999999899221,1.00779162792719e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Enhancement of anti-oxidant effect was also observed in the case of use of natural supplements assayed by DPPH and ABTS(center dot) radical scavenging assays. Similarly anti-staphylococcal and anti-candida activities were potentially higher when natural supplements were used followed by co-culturing.

11091,Fungal communities in gardens of the leafcutter ant Atta cephalotes in forest and cabruca agrosystems of southern Bahia State (Brazil),"Leaf-cutting ants interact with several fungi in addition to the fungal symbiont they cultivate for food. Here, we assessed alien fungal communities in colonies of Atta cephalotes. Fungus garden fragments were sampled from colonies in the Atlantic Rainforest and in a cabruca agrosystem in the state of Bahia (Brazil) in two distinct periods to evaluate whether differences in nest habitat influence the diversity of fungi in the ant colonies. We recovered a total of 403 alien fungi isolates from 628 garden fragments. The prevalent taxa found in these samples were Escovopsis sp. (26 %), Escovopsioides nivea (24 %), and Trichoderma spirale (10.9 %). Fungal diversity was similar between the colonies sampled in both areas suggesting that ants focus on reducing loads of alien fungi in the fungus gardens instead of avoiding specific fungi. However, fungal taxa composition differed between colonies sampled in the two areas and between the sampling periods. These differences are likely explained by the availability of plant substrates available for foraging over habitats and periods. Ordination analysis further supported that sampling period was the main attribute for community structuring but also revealed that additional factors may explain the structuring of fungal communities in colonies of A. cephalotes.

4753,Influence of the ryegrass endophyte (Neotyphodium lolii) in a cool-moist environment III. Interaction with white clover,"White clover was grown together with either endophyte-free or endophyte-infected (strain either AR6 or wildtype) Nui ryegrass under four environmental conditions (covering low or moderate temperatures, moist or droughted soil, clippings removed or returned) in a glasshouse experiment. The presence of wildtype endophyte in ryegrass plants had in general, but especially under optimal growing conditions, a significant positive effect (P < 0.05) on white clover stolen length, number of growing points, and the number of nodules. No endophyte effect was observed on the distribution of nodules over root depth, size, and colour classes under any environment. It is postulated that endophyte-associated compounds in root leachates may have an effect on mycorrhiza, the size of the effect increasing with the level of abiotic stress to which ryegrass plants are subjected.","Eerens, JPJ; Lucas, RJ; Easton, HS; White, JGH",NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH,1998,10.1080/00288233.1998.9513303,0.912979569019384,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99980702665747,1.9297334253033e-4,0.999999999999839,1.60871316268185e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
4876,Mining Indole Alkaloid Synthesis Gene Clusters from Genomes of 53 Claviceps Strains Revealed Redundant Gene Copies and an Approximate Evolutionary Hourglass Model,"Ergot fungi (Claviceps spp.) are infamous for producing sclerotia containing a wide spectrum of ergot alkaloids (EA) toxic to humans and animals, making them nefarious villains in the agricultural and food industries, but also treasures for pharmaceuticals. In addition to three classes of EAs, several species also produce paspaline-derived indole diterpenes (IDT) that cause ataxia and staggers in livestock. Furthermore, two other types of alkaloids, i.e., loline (LOL) and peramine (PER), found in Epichloe spp., close relatives of Claviceps, have shown beneficial effects on host plants without evidence of toxicity to mammals. The gene clusters associated with the production of these alkaloids are known. We examined genomes of 53 strains of 19 Claviceps spp. to screen for these genes, aiming to understand the evolutionary patterns of these genes across the genus through phylogenetic and DNA polymorphism analyses. Our results showed (1) varied numbers of eas genes in C. sect. Claviceps and sect. Pusillae, none in sect. Citrinae, six idt/ltm genes in sect. Claviceps (except four in C. cyperi), zero to one partial (idtG) in sect. Pusillae, and four in sect. Citrinae, (2) two to three copies of dmaW, easE, easF, idt/ltmB, itd/ltmQ in sect.

3561,Induction of Nectriapyrone Biosynthesis in the Rice Blast Fungus Pyricularia oryzae by Disturbance of the Two-Component Signal Transduction System,"Most fungal secondary metabolism genes are poorly expressed under laboratory conditions. Nectriapyrones are known as secondary metabolites produced mainly by symbiotic fungi, including endophytes and plant pathogens. Herein, we show the induction of nectriapyrone production in the rice blast fungus Pyricularia oryzae. The two-component signal transduction system was disturbed by disrupting OSM1 and PoYPD1, which encoded a HOG MAP kinase and a His-containing phosphotransfer (HPt) protein, respectively. This induced the production of two polyketide compounds: nectriapyrone and its hydroxylated analogue. The nectriapyrone biosynthetic gene cluster consists of a polyketide synthase gene (NEC1) and an O-methyltransferase gene (NEC2). Overexpression of the two genes induced overproduction of nectriapyrone and five nectriapyrone analogues, including a new derivative. Nectriapyrone production was not required for the infection of rice. The structure of nectriapyrone is similar to that of the germicidins produced by Streptomyces spp., and nectriapyrone inhibited the growth of Streptomyces griseus.","Motoyama, T; Nogawa, T; Hayashi, T; Hirota, H; Osada, H",CHEMBIOCHEM,2019,10.1002/cbic.201800620,0.968286202260997,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.970309080649685,0.0296909193503153,0.999999980789605,1.92103950524825e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

A total of 458 endophytic isolates were obtained from leaf, stem and fruit tissues of Solanum rubrum and Morinda pubescence. The dominant endophytic fungi belong to genera Aspergillus, Colletotrichum, Curvularia and Mycelia sterilia. Maximum endophytic isolates were obtained from leaves segments followed by stem and fruit tissues. In both the plants class hypomycetes were dominant over other fungal classes. Shannon- Weiner and Simpson indexes showed rich diversity of endophytic fungi suggesting even and uniform occurrence of various species. The endophytic isolates showed varying degree of antimicrobial activity against 9 human pathogens. In S. rubrum 20% and 10% of the isolates inhibited all the Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and 35% of the isolates displayed antifungal activity against all the test fungal pathogens. One of the isolate showed considerable antimicrobial activity against all the test pathogens. Endophytic isolates of M. pubescence showed 24% antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria and 28% antifungal activity against all the test fungal pathogens. The study revealed that medicinal plants associated endophytes could be a rich source of antimicrobial agents. © 2013 S.K. Jena and K.

2915,Diaporthe decedens Is the Causal Agent of Canker of Hop Hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia) in Tuscany (Italy),"During 2018, extensive European hop-hornbeam (Ostrya carpinifolia L.) diebacks were observed in natural stands in the Apennines (central Italy). Cankers on the stems and branches and crown dieback were the more common symptoms observed, mainly at the beginning of the growing season. In 2023, similar symptoms were reported on the same host species in natural stands in the province of Lucca. Three species were most frequently isolated from the tissues of symptomatic plants: Diaporthe decedens, Dothiorella parva and Pezicula sporulosa. The identity of these species was confirmed through phylogenetic analysis. Their pathogenicity was assessed with two trials performed on 2-year-old hop-hornbeam seedlings and cut shoots. Dothiorella parva and Pezicula sporulosa caused limited necrotic lesions only on cut shoots, while D. decedens showed the higher virulence and aggressiveness, being able to cause extensive cankers in both trials. To our knowledge, this is the first report of D. decedens causing cankers and dieback on O. carpinifolia in Italy or elsewhere. Considering the ecological importance of O. carpinifolia as a pioneer species, further investigations are needed to assess the spread of the disease and the extent of its impact in natural stands.","Gionni, A; Pecori, F; Puca, A; Berto, H; Pepori, AL; Santini, A",FOREST PATHOLOGY,2025,10.1111/efp.70026,0.92794672125014,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.989646189808146,0.0103538101918541,0.999999999994915,5.0847104304807496e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Methods: Ethyl acetate extracts were obtained by liquid-liquid partition of fermentation broth of endophytes followed by evaporation. The antimicrobial activities were determined by diffusion techniques followed by thin layer chromatography-bioautography. Cytotoxicity studies were conducted using 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide assay. Data generated were used to plot a dose-response curve, of which the concentration of extract required to kill 50% of cell population (IC50) was determined. Results: Two endophytes were isolated from leaves and stem of P. crocatum, designated as DS1 and BS1. Ethyl acetate extracts of BS1 was found to inhibit the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus at minimum dose of 31.25, 125 and 250 μg, respectively. thin layer chromatography-bioautography of this extract resulted in at least two inhibition zones. BS1 extract also inhibited the growth of WiDr and T47D cell lines with IC50 of 120.38 μg/mL and 37.43 μg/mL, respectively.

7793,Endophytism and bioactivity of endophytic fungi isolated from Combretum lanceolatum Pohl ex Eichler,"We report the isolation and identification of endophytic fungi from Combretum lanceolatum Pohl ex Eichler. Further, we evaluated the relationships of fungi with the host plant and tested bioactivities of isolates. The fungi were isolated from disinfected root fragments and plated onto potato dextrose agar. Root pieces were also used to quantify fungal structures associated with the roots. Identification of fungi was carried out by characterization of morphological features and sequencing of the ITS region. Endophytism was confirmed by inoculation of endophyte-free seedlings followed by microscopic examination. The extract was obtained by maceration of the mycelium in ethyl acetate for antioxidant and antimicrobial evaluations. A total of 112 strains belonging to nine different species were isolated, the major classes were Dothideomycetes and Sordariomycetes. C. lanceolatum is colonized by dark septate endophytes (DSE), evidenced by the presence of microsclerotia and melanized hyphae. There is also co-colonization with mycorrhizal fungi in the same root fragments. Seedling inoculation experiments revealed that C. perangustum-95C and M. phaseolina-46C showed association with the seedlings of C. lanceolatum and differentiated microsclerotia and dark septate hyphae, indicating that these species are DSE. In the antimicrobial test, the D. phaseolorum-92C extract had the highest zones of inhibition against S. aureus and E. coli, respectively. The results showed that 100 % of the extracts have antioxidant activity ranging from low to moderate.

16302,First report on a wonder endophyte Coma circularis from Basella rubra L. stem: a house of pharmaceutically active compounds,"Basella rubra L. is a tremendous source of biologically active compounds with proven therapeutic properties. Endophytes facilitate many of these properties. The selected fresh stems were surface sterilized, cut into small bits and cultured on potato dextrose agar plate for 7–10 days. Microscopic and molecular methods were used to characterize the fungi. This study isolated Coma circularis for the first time as an endophyte and inoculated it into potato dextrose broth for fermentation for 14 days. The broth was filtered, lyophilized, and tested. The filtrate showed antibacterial activity against antimicrobial resistant human pathogens of both Gram-positive (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Minimum Inhibitory Concentration 5 mg/ml) and Gram-negative bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, 5 mg/ml and Acinetobacter sp., Minimum Inhibitory Concentration 2.5 mg/ml). The outcomes of time kill kinetics assay depended on duration of exposure and concentration of filtrate. Filtrate potentially inhibited the tested bacteria at 2X MIC and 1X MIC, till 30 h; and at 1/2X MIC, up to 18 h. Furthermore, it damaged the cell membrane, which led to significant protein and nucleic acid leakage in treated cells at early hours (2 h). MTT assay analyzed the anti-proliferative effect on MCF7, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, and MCF 10A cell lines. The measured IC50 values were 224.31, 326.28, 382.89 and 701.21 µg/ml respectively. In silico analysis predicted that a few compounds have antimicrobial and anticancer properties and fall within in Lipinski's rule of five. Based on BOILED Egg prediction, except two, all are absorbed in GI or entered to brain. Therapeutic bioactive molecules in LCFS can be a good source and can open a door in new drug development to overcome the threats of AMR. As C. circularis has been isolated and identified as an endophyte from Basella rubra for the first time and no other findings have been publicly available, in-depth research is needed on the organism and its mode of action.

5371,Diaporthe eres causes stem cankers and death of young apple rootstocks in Canada,"In the spring of 2018, necrotic and canker symptoms were observed on stems of young apple trees that were bench-grafted by growers on four rootstocks (EMLA 9, Supporter 4, M9-T337 and Pajam 2) in Annapolis Valley, Nova Scotia. The objective of this study was to isolate and identify the causal organism of the disease on apple rootstocks. The diseased tissue obtained from eight infected plants of the four rootstocks showing visible necrotic and canker symptoms was used for microorganism isolation on potato dextrose agar (PDA). More than 90% of the isolates on PDA yielded a similar type of fungal colony. Based on the colony and spore morphology and presence of both alpha and beta spores, Diaporthe was proposed as a major pathogen from the symptomatic tissue. Analysis of partial sequences of four unlinked loci DNA-lyase (APN2), histone-3 (HIS), translation elongation factor 1 alpha (TEF1-alpha) and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 5.8S region of rDNA of the representative fungal isolates from young apple trees confirmed its identity as D. eres (Phomopsis fukushii). The pathogenicity of the representative D. eres isolate was confirmed on 1-year-old young apple trees bench-grafted on four different rootstocks in greenhouse tests. Necrotic and sunken canker symptoms like those observed on the nursery-grown young apple trees appeared on stems of all inoculated plants. The necrotic and canker lesions were observed 3 days after inoculation; they spread both directions from the inoculation point and led to the death of the young plants after 4 weeks.

We sought to localize and characterize growth patterns of the fungus within leaves and petioles of Oxytropis lambertii Pursh and Oxytropis sericea Nutt. to help define the types of interactions between the fungus and its hosts. Vegetative hyphae were observed within locoweed tissues using integrated imaging. Topographical images from scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of the endophyte in the pith tissue of petioles. The fungus was identified between plant cells but did not appear to penetrate host cells. Transmission electron microscopy images of thin sections revealed that hyphae were closely associated with host cell walls. Oxytropis sericea was innoculated with green fluorescent protein-transformed U. oxytropis and observed by confocal microscopy, confirming the presence of the endophyte hyphae in leaves and petioles. The fungus was identified only in the pith of petioles using fluorescence and in the vascular bundle throughout extracellular spaces in leaves. These results revealed no signs of a pathogenic interaction between plant and fungus and support the hypothesis of a mutualistic or commensal relationship.","Reyna, R; Cooke, P; Grum, D; Cook, D; Creamer, R",BOTANY-BOTANIQUE,2012,10.1139/b2012-092,0.990973173714544,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999872308109467,1.276918905332e-4,0.999999999920401,7.95994381519449e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

10324,Comparison of theoretical and experimental values for plant uptake of pesticide from soil,"Pesticides that persist in soils may be taken up by the roots of plants. One way to assess plant uptake is to theoretically predict the extent of plant uptake using a mathematical model. In this study, a model was developed to predict plant uptake of pesticide residues in soils using various parameters, such as pesticide mobility within soil, plant transpiration stream, root-soil transfer rate, plant growth, and pesticide dissipation in either soils or plants. The accuracy of the model was evaluated by comparing the modeled concentrations with measured uptake concentrations of chlorpyrifos ( CP) in lettuce, grown on treated soils with concentrations of approximately 10 and 20 mg kg(-1) CP. Measured concentrations of CP in lettuce at 21, 30, and 40 d after planting were between the 5th and 95th percentiles of model variation. A high correlation coefficient of >0.97 between modeled and measured concentrations was found. Coefficients of variation of mean factors to residual errors were between 25.3 and 48.2%. Overall, modeling results matched the experimental results well. Therefore, this plant uptake model could be used as an assessment tool to predict the extent of plant uptake of pesticide residues in soils.","Hwang, JI; Lee, SE; Kim, JE",PLOS ONE,2017,10.1371/journal.pone.0172254,0.982591642617817,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.383038946266273,0.616961053733727,0.999836661999972,1.6333800002765e-4,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

12716,Do the costs and benefits of fungal endophyte symbiosis vary with light availability?,"P>Here, we examined whether fungal endophytes modulated host plant responses to light availability. First, we conducted a literature review to evaluate whether natural frequencies of endophyte symbiosis in grasses from shaded habitats were higher than frequencies in grasses occupying more diverse light environments. Then, in a glasshouse experiment, we assessed how four levels of light and the presence of endophyte symbioses affected the growth of six grass species. In our literature survey, endophytes were more commonly present in grasses restricted to shaded habitats than in grasses from diverse light environments. In the glasshouse, endophyte symbioses did not mediate plant growth in response to light availability. However, in the host grass, Agrostis perennans, symbiotic plants produced 53% more inflorescences than nonsymbiotic plants at the highest level of shade. In addition, under high shade, symbiotic Poa autumnalis invested more in specific leaf area than symbiont-free plants. Finally, shade increased the density of the endophyte in leaf tissues across all six grass species. Our results highlight the potential for symbiosis to alter the plasticity of host physiological traits, demonstrate a novel benefit of endophyte symbiosis under shade stress for one host species, and show a positive association between shade-restricted grass species and fungal endophytes.","Davitt, AJ; Stansberry, M; Rudgers, JA",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,2010,10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03428.x,0.971332068766121,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990953627678585,0.00904637232141473,0.999039898414424,9.6010158557569e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

2762,THE INTERACTION OF HARVESTER ANTS AND VESICULAR ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI IN A PATCHY SEMIARID ENVIRONMENT - THE EFFECTS OF MOUND STRUCTURE ON FUNGAL DISPERSION AND ESTABLISHMENT,"1. Disc areas created by the western harvester ant, Pogonomyrmex occidentalis, around their mound nests can comprise over 10% of the land surface in semi-arid shrub steppes of the Great Basin, USA. The harvester ant mounds are abandoned after 12-20 years and the mycorrhizal fungal inoculum dispersion patterns within these patches may affect subsequent plant establishment. 2. It was hypothesized that harvester ant activity reduces mycorrhizal inoculum levels within the disc, and that mycorrhizal fungi must re-establish in these patches from surface-deposited, immigrating inoculum. 3. To test this, we first excavated two ant mounds, which revealed a chambered core consisting of a mat of densely packed, clipped roots with 2000-5000 times the vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal spore density found in the surrounding undisturbed vegetation. To assess the effectiveness of these enriched patches of inoculum, non-mycorrhizal seedlings of Artemisia tridentata (sagebrush) and Oryzopsis hymenoides (Indian ricegrass) were planted around the perimeter of nine mycorrhizae-enriched ant mounds and compared with surface inoculation of an exotic mycorrhizal fungus, Gigaspora margarita, capable of being tracked through immunofluorescence. 4. Results from these field bioassays demonstrated that surface-deposited mycorrhizal inoculum did not expand downward into the soil and buried inoculum resulted in high levels of endophyte root infection. 5. It was concluded that harvester ant mounds exhibit nest microbial enrichment, and that the ants leave high densities of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in locations suitable for assisting in the establishment of mutualistic mycorrhizal associations after the mounds are abandoned.","FRIESE, CF; ALLEN, MF",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,1993,10.2307/2389862,0.991329855950343,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999846800702279,1.5319929772092e-4,0.999999999808791,1.91208937572185e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
14168,Isolation and identification of the Epichloë endophyte from Bothriochloa ischaemum and its heavy metal tolerance,"Tailings dams are unique growth environment for plants and contain a large amount of heavy metals in the soil, which affects plant physiology and ecology. To enhance endophytic fungal resources, we studied the endophytic fungi of Bothriochloa ischaemum living in copper tailings. Bothriochloa ischaemum was the dominant species in 'eighteenth' river tailings of the Northern Copper Mine. We collected live plants and separated the endophytes from the sheaths, and observed and described the endophyte characteristics and spore morphology. Simultaneously, we selected seven strains for actG, tefA, and tubB amplification, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. Our results showed that the endophytic fungus had a white colony and very slow growth rate. The spores were spherical and oval shaped, between 1.208 and 8.048 μm in size. Molecular identification identified the endophyte as Epichloë sibirica. We found that E. sibirica had a relatively high tolerance to several different heavy metals as follows: Zn2+(120 mg/L), Cu2+(160 mg/L), Pb2+(240 mg/L), and Cd2+(8 mg/L) based on experiments with different heavy metal concentrations.

19588,Antagonistic activity of endophytic actinobacteria from native potatoes (Solanum tuberosum subsp. tuberosum L.) against Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and Pectobacterium atrosepticum.,"The native potatoes (Solanum tuberosum subsp. tuberosum L.) grown in Chile (Chiloé) represent a new, unexplored source of endophytes to find potential biological control agents for the prevention of bacterial diseases, like blackleg and soft rot, in potato crops. The objective of this study was the selection of endophytic actinobacteria from native potatoes for antagonistic activity against Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum and Pectobacterium atrosepticum, and their potential to suppress tissue maceration symptoms in potato tubers. This potential was determined through the quorum quenching activity using a Chromobacterium violaceaum ATCC 12472 Wild type (WT) bioassay and its colonization behavior of the potato plant root system (S. tuberosum) by means of the Double labeling of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (DOPE-FISH) targeting technique. The results showed that although Streptomyces sp. TP199 and Streptomyces sp. A2R31 were able to inhibit the growth of the pathogens, only the Streptomyces sp. TP199 isolate inhibited Pectobacterium sp. growth and diminished tissue maceration in tubers (p ≤ 0.05). Streptomyces sp. TP199 had metal-dependent acyl homoserine lactones (AHL) quorum quenching activity in vitro and was able to colonize the root endosphere 10 days after inoculation.

4124,Volatile Compounds of Endophytic Bacillus spp. have Biocontrol Activity Against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum,"To develop an effective biological agent to control Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, three endophytic Bacillus spp. strains with high antagonistic activity were isolated from maize seed and characterized. In vitro assays revealed that the Bacillus endophytes could produce volatile organic compounds (VOC) that reduced sclerotial production and inhibited mycelial growth of S. sclerotiorum. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed that the selected strains produced 16 detectable VOC. Eight of the produced VOC exhibited negative effects on S. sclerotiorum, while a further four induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species in mycelial cells. A mixture of VOC produced by Bacillus velezensis VM11 caused morphological changes in the ultrastructure and organelle membranes of S. sclerotiorum mycelial cells. The bromophenol blue assay revealed a yellow color of untreated fungal mycelium, which grew faster and deeper from 24 to 72 h postinoculation, as an indication of reduced pH. The potassium permanganate (KMnO4) titration assay showed that the rate of oxalic acid accumulation was higher in minimal salt liquid medium cultures inoculated with untreated fungal plugs compared with the Bacillus VOC-treated ones. Interestingly, biological control assays using host-plant leaves challenged with treated fungal mycelial plugs produced reduced lesions compared with the control. These findings provide new viable possibilities of controlling diseases caused by S. sclerotiorum using VOC produced by Bacillus endophytes.","Massawe, VC; Hanif, A; Farzand, A; Mburu, DK; Ochola, SO; Wu, LM; Tahir, HAS; Gu, Q; Wu, HJ; Gao, XW",PHYTOPATHOLOGY,2018,10.1094/PHYTO-04-18-0118-R,0.877063395960993,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999941544193573,5.84558064270743e-5,0.999999999999993,6.5503158452884204e-15,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
721,Paclitaxel-producing fungal endophyte stimulates the accumulation of taxoids in suspension cultures of Taxus cuspidate,"Fusarium mairei, a paclitaxel-producing fungal endophyte, its effects on taxoid synthesis in Taxus cells were investigated via adding the fungal endophyte culture supernatants (FECS) to the suspension cultures of Taxus cuspidata. The concentration of FECS was determined on its total carbohydrate. When 100 mL of Taxus cell suspension cultures were treated with several dosages of FECS (4, 6 and 8 g) at day 10, the cultures treated with 6 g FECS produced the highest yield of paclitaxel (5.84 mg L-1), which was 1.8-fold the yield from controls (3.14 mg L-1). The major elicitor element in FECS was an oligosaccharide of 2 kDa. In addition, the cultures treated with 6 g FECS resulted in 25.86 mg L-1 of the precursor 10-deacetylbaccatin III (10-DAB) accumulation, which was 11 times that of control cultures (2.32 mg L-1), and 4.7 times higher than that of cultures treated with 200 mu M methyl jasmonate (MJ) (5.43 mg L-1). These results indicate that FECS favors to stimulate 10-DAB accumulation more effectively than paclitaxel accumulation. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

17006,Characterization of N2-fixing plant growth promoting endophytic and epiphytic bacterial community of Indian cultivated and wild rice (Oryza spp.) genotypes.,"The diversity of endophytic and epiphytic diazotrophs in different parts of rice plants has specificity to the niche (i.e. leaf, stem and root) of different genotypes and nutrient availability of the organ. Inoculation of the indigenous, polyvalent diazotrophs can facilitate and sustain production of non-leguminous crops like rice. Therefore, N2-fixing plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) were isolated from different parts of three Indian cultivated [Oryza sativa L. var.

4607,"ASSESSMENT OF FIELD SITUATIONS FOR THE FEASIBILITY OF VESICULAR ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL INOCULATION, USING A FORAGE LEGUME AS TEST PLANT","This paper reports experiments aimed at predicting ecological situations whose vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) inoculation would be beneficial. Twelve unsterile soils were assayed and Hedysarum coronarium, a forage legume, was the test plant. Three vesicular-arbuscular endophytes, namely Glomus mosseae, G. fasciculatus and a Glomus sp. were tested, and in all cases G. mosseae was the most efficient, with indications of some plant-fungus specificity. A considerable degree of dependency on mycorrhizas, for suitable growth and N2-fixation, was also demonstrated for the tested legume-Rhizobium sp. system. The studied soils varied in their concentration of plant-available phosphorus and in the amount, infectivity and effectiveness of indigenous VAM propagules; however, no correlation between these parameters could be found. The level of success of the introduction of G. mosseae in the presence of naturally existing endophytes was evaluated by the extent of the plant response in terms of growth, nodulation and N and P uptake in each soil. The inoculation of G. mosseae was effective in 7 out of the 12 soils; however, it was not possible to find a correlation between any of the soil parameters studied (i.e. soluble P concentration, amount of mycorrhizal root pieces and VAM mycelium and spores) and the plant response to G. mosseae inoculation. Thus, it is necessary to emphasize the need for simple techniques to screen situations where it would be worth attempting VAM inoculation, since each particular soil must be checked for each given plant-fungus combination.","AZCONAGUILAR, C; BAREA, JM; AZCON, R; DIAZRODRIGUEZ, RM",AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT,1986,10.1016/0167-8809(86)90123-4,0.989916778355102,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.989417938737551,0.0105820612624488,0.999999993362045,6.637954963473191e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19463,Tailored Media Are Key to Unlocking the Diversity of Endophytic Bacteria in Distinct Compartments of Germinating Seeds.,"Seeds offer an internal microbial niche, termed the endosphere, colonized by communities of endophytic bacteria. To elucidate the functions of seed endophytes during germination and early plant growth, studies with culturable isolates are essential. Conventional growth media favor few fast-growing taxa, while micro organisms with restricted nutrient requirements are usually outcompeted prior to isolation. Consequently, current knowledge of the interaction between seeds and their endophytes remains limited to only few bacterial taxa, despite a ""black box"" of unculturable isolates colonizing the endosphere. Here, we designed various solid media to mimic the endosphere of germinating soybean (Glycine max L.) seeds and assessed their effect on the diversity of culturable endophytic bacteria. The embryonic axis (i.e., the future plant) possessed higher richness and harbored more unique genera (i.e., Brevundimonas, Methylobacterium, Microbacterium, Pseudoclavibacter, and Rathayibacter) than cotyledons (i.e., seed storage organs). Overall, media containing germinating and ground seeds enabled culturing and isolation of the broadest diversity of endophytic bacteria, viewed through the molecular identification of 246 isolates. The use of multiple tailored media helped uncover trophic adaptation of the core taxa. Furthermore, comparison of seeds from four lots of distinct cultivars and origin revealed few overlapping taxa, indicating that the parental environment, including soil and fertilization regime, influenced seed endophytic diversity. Extended diversity of native seed endophytic bacteria revealed the functional relevance of unique Arthrobacter, Bacillus, and Curtobacterium strains to seed germination under salt stress, exemplifying the importance of enhanced culturing approaches to elucidate the role of microbiota in seed germination. IMPORTANCE Plant growth-promoting endophytic isolates that appear to advance seed germination are often obtained from plant niches other than the seed endosphere. Isolating pure cultures of native endophytes from seeds during germination is crucial to investigate their function during early plant growth. Here, the diversity of endophytic bacteria isolated from seeds during soybean germination was enhanced by combining media tailored to the nutritional composition of the seed endosphere, including pregerminated seeds themselves.

6093,"Enhancement of Diosgenin Production in Plantlet and Cell Cultures of Dioscorea zingiberensis by Palmarumycin C13 from the Endophytic fungus, Berkleasmium sp Dzf12","Purpose: To study the effect of palmarumycin C-13, an elicitor from the endophytic fungus Berkleasmium sp. Dzf12, on growth and diosgenin production in plantlet or cell cultures of its host plant, Dioscorea zingiberensis. Methods: Palmarumycin C-13 was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of the endophytic fungus Berkleasmium sp. Dzf12 using a combination of high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC), Sephadex LH-20 chromatography and preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The biomass of the plantlet and cell cultures of D. zingiberensis as well as their diosgenin content and yield were analyzed after treatment with palmarumycin C-13. Results: Optimal elicitation of diosgenin production by palmarumycin C-13 in D. zingiberensis plantlet and cell cultures was achieved when palmarumycin C-13 was added to the medium at a concentration of 60 mg/L (for plantlet culture) at the beginning of culturing or 10 mg/L (for cell culture) on day 25 after inoculation. By using these optimal concentrations, the diosgenin yield of the cultured plantlets reached its maximum of 6.44 mg/L, that is, > 1.4-fold increase, while diosgenin yield of the cultured cells reached a maximum of 10.73 mg/L, which is an > 8.0-fold increase. Conclusion: Addition of palmarumycin C-13 from the endophytic fungus, Berkleasmium sp. Dzf12, is a potentially effective strategy for enhancing diosgenin production in D. zingiberensis plantlet and cell cultures.","Mou, Y; Zhou, KY; Xu, D; Yu, RT; Li, J; Yin, CH; Zhou, LG",TROPICAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH,2015,10.4314/tjpr.v14i2.8,0.724794975558781,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.369343629681749,0.630656370318251,0.999999454787419,5.45212581415377e-7,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
5313,Dual symbiosis between Piriformospora indica and Azotobacter chroococcum enhances the artemisinin content in Artemisia annua L.,"At present, Artemisia annua L. is the major source of artemisinin production. To control the outbreaks of malaria, artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs) are recommended, and hence an ample amount of artemisinin is required for ACTs manufacture to save millions of lives. The low yield of this antimalarial drug in A. annua L. plants (0.01-1.1 %) ensues its short supply and high cost, thus making it a topic of scrutiny worldwide. In this study, the effects of root endophyte, Piriformospora indica strain DSM 11827 and nitrogen fixing bacterium, Azotobacter chroococcum strain W-5, either singly and/or in combination for artemisinin production in A. annua L. plants have been studied under poly house conditions. The plant growth was monitored by measuring parameters like height of plant, total dry weight and leaf yield with an increase of 63.51, 52.61 and 79.70 % respectively, for treatment with dual biological consortium, as compared to that of control plants. This significant improvement in biomass was associated with higher total chlorophyll content (59.29 %) and enhanced nutrition (especially nitrogen and phosphorus, 55.75 and 86.21 % respectively). The concentration of artemisinin along with expression patterns of artemisinin biosynthesis genes were appreciably higher in dual treatment, which showed positive correlation. The study suggested the potential use of the consortium P. indica strain DSM 11827 and A. chroococcum strain W-5 in A. annua L. plants for increased overall productivity and sustainable agriculture.","Arora, M; Saxena, P; Choudhary, DK; Abdin, MZ; Varma, A",WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY,2016,10.1007/s11274-015-1972-5,0.99248799068279,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.919475007492505,0.0805249925074952,0.99999997270831,2.7291690463116e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
876,Do colonization by dark septate endophytes and elevated temperature affect pathogenicity of oomycetes?,"Phialocephala subalpina is one of the most frequent dark septate root endophytes in tree roots but its function in forest ecosystems is largely unknown. A full-factorial infection experiment was performed, using six P. subalpina isolates, two pathogenic oomycetes (Phytophthora plurivora [syn. Phytophthora citricola s.l.] and Elongisporangium undulatum [syn. Pythium undulatum]) and two temperature regimes (17.9 and 21.6 degrees C) to examine the ability of P. subalpina to protect Norway spruce seedlings against root pathogens. Seedling survival, disease intensity and seedling growth were affected by P. subalpina genotype, temperature and pathogen species. Some P. subalpina isolates effectively reduced mortality and disease intensity caused by the two pathogens. Elevated temperature adversely affected seedling growth but did not aggravate the effect of the pathogens. Elongisporangium undulatum but not P. plurivora significantly reduced plant growth. Colonization density of P. subalpina measured by quantitative PCR was not affected by temperature or the presence of the pathogens. In conclusion, P. subalpina confers an indirect benefit to its host and might therefore be tolerated in natural ecosystems, despite negative effects on plant health and plant growth.","Tellenbach, C; Sieber, TN",FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY,2012,10.1111/j.1574-6941.2012.01415.x,0.977912262471899,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996572719652756,0.00342728034724365,0.999999998610903,1.38909672653398e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3532,Effects of Isaria cateniannulata and Beauveria bassiana on Buckwheat Growth and Associated Insect Pest,"The Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae) is one of the primary pests affecting buckwheat, and its management has become increasingly critical. Entomopathogenic fungi offer a promising way to solve this problem by providing both pest control and disease resistance, as well as promoting plant growth through endophytic colonization. This study investigated the effects of applying Isaria cateniannulata (Liang) Samson & Hywel-Jones and Beauveria bassiana (Bals.-Criv.) Vuill. on different buckwheat varieties, and analyzed the physiological indices of buckwheat, the population of T. urticae and Euseius nicholsi (Ehara & Lee). Results showed that the optimum concentration for fungal colonization on buckwheat was 1 x 107 spores/mL. The combined application of I. cateniannulata and B. bassiana significantly enhanced buckwheat growth, with root length, plant height, main stem diameter, fresh weight, and dry weight reaching 63.3 mm, 24.1 cm, 2.1 mm, 2.0 g, and 0.1 g, respectively. The highest escape rate of T. urticae was 76.33%. Furthermore, the combined application of mixed fungal suspension and E. nicholsi had the best control effect on T. urticae, with pest suppression exceeding 97.83% and an oviposition as low as 0.25 eggs per female. This study is the first to demonstrate that the joint application of I. cateniannulata and B. bassiana can promote buckwheat growth and, when combined with predatory mites, effectively control T. urticae. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the development of integrated biocontrol strategies combining entomopathogenic fungi and predatory mites.","Zhang, XN; Gu, LD; Liu, C; Yang, GM; Yang, X; Huang, KF; Chen, QF",BIOMOLECULES,2025,10.3390/biom15071039,0.934080894909732,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.989708015981071,0.0102919840189287,0.999999986840403,1.31595971897269e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

6176,Fungicide Treatments to Control Seed-borne Fungi of Sunflower Seeds,"Seed-borne fungi in 69 sunflower cultivars were evaluated which comprised 52 confectionery and 17 oilseed types. Seed coats were placed on both NP-10 (Nonylphenol Ethoxylate based surfacant 10) and potato dextrose agar (PDA) media to culture fungi. The rate of contamination among the different varieties was calculated by counting seed coats with fungal colonies. The rate of contamination in the confectionary group (88%) was significantly (p <= 0.05) higher than in the oilseed group (71%). Of the 52 confectionery varieties, the dominant fungi recovered were Verticillium dahliae along with Alternaria spp., Fusarium spp., and Rhizopus spp., whereas the oilseed type varieties were contaminated with only V. dahliae. Molecular identification of fungal species via BLAST (Basic Alignment Search Tool) was performed on fungal sequences obtained from PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) analysis. The results included five Alternaria spp. that included Alternaria tenuissima, Alternaria alternata, Alternaria helianthiinficiens, Alternaria longipes, and Alternaria tamaricis, three Fusarium spp. such as Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium incarnatum, and Fusarium proliferatum, and V. dahliae and Cladosporium cladosporioides. These were identified from pure fungal cultures recovered from seed coats. To efficiently control seed-borne fungi, four broad spectrum fungicides (carbendazim, triadimefon, caprio F-500, and flusilazole) were screened against V. dahliae isolate Gn3, which was isolated from a diseased LD 5009 sunflower plant. Flusilazole was selected based on its low half-maximal effective concentration value (EC50), 78.7 mu g/mL. Seeds of diseased LD5009 plants obtained from two different locations treated with formulated flusilazole fungicide at optimum parameters showed a significant (p <= 0.05) increase in seed germination and a decrease in contamination rate from 98% to less than 10%. The results affirmed that confectionery cultivars are much more susceptible to fungal contamination than oilseeds, and also that seed pretreatment is a suitable way to prevent the spread of soil- and seed-borne fungi in sunflower production.","Addrah, ME; Zhang, YY; Zhang, J; Liu, L; Zhou, HY; Chen, WD; Zhao, J",PATHOGENS,2020,10.3390/pathogens9010029,0.971166728836484,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.81378919834293,0.18621080165707,0.999955520661488,4.4479338512371e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
12355,Response of Pratylenchus spp. in tall fescue infected with different strains of the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum,"The presence of the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum in tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) confers resistance to some plant-parasitic nematodes but also results in the production of ergot alkaloids. Recently, new strains of N. coenophialum have been isolated from wild tall fescue and artificially inoculated into elite tall fescue cultivars. These strains produce low to nil levels of ergot alkaloids and are referred to as non-ergot strains. Our objective was to determine whether non-ergot strains of the endophyte confer the same level of resistance to Pratylenchus spp. as the endemic strain in tall fescue. In a glasshouse experiment, nematode resistance was compared in two fescue cultivars (Jesup and Georgia 5) infected with either the endemic strain (E(+)), or two non-ergot strains, AR542 and AR584. An additional non-ergot strain, AR514, was tested only in cv. Jesup. Cultivars Georgia 5 and Jesup without endophytes (E(-)) were used as controls. The endophtye status of the plants was confirmed and then three plants per cultivar/endophyte combination were transplanted into 10 cm square pots. The pots were inoculated with a mixed culture of Pratylenchus zeae and P. scribneri in the first trial and a pure culture of P. scribneri in the second trial of the experiment. After 8 weeks, the number of nematodes within the roots from each pot was determined. Numbers of Pratylenchus spp. in either cv. Georgia 5 or cv. Jesup containing the non-ergot strain AR542 were not different from numbers in E- plants. AR514 also did not confer resistance to the nematodes in cv. Jesup. By contrast, the non-ergot strain AR584 appears to confer resistance to Pratylenchus spp. in cv. Georgia 5, but not in cv. Jesup; however, the level of resistance in cv. Georgia 5 was less than the resistance conferred by the endemic endophyte. Genetic differences between the two tall fescue cultivars may affect growth of the endophyte or production of a nematode toxin or deterrent by the endophyte. As only a small subset of endophyte strains has been tested, we are screening additional non-ergot strains for resistance to P. scribneri.","Timper, P; Gates, RN; Bouton, JH",NEMATOLOGY,2005,10.1163/1568541054192216,0.768544923090142,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985993885758756,0.0140061142412442,0.999999982250433,1.77495671493944e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

The aim of this study was to consider the possible cause of die-back on native coastal red milkwood (Mimusops caffra) trees growing on the east coast of South Africa. Samples were taken from symptomatic tissue and isolations were made. The resulting isolates were identified based on DNA sequence data from the rDNA-ITS, translation elongation factor 1- and -tubulin loci. Two new species in the Botryosphaeriales, namely Neofusicoccum variabile sp. nov. and Pseudofusicoccum africanum sp. nov., were found together with an isolate of N. mangroviorum. Neofusicoccum mangroviorum produced significantly longer lesions than the other two species and the control inoculations in pathogenicity tests and it appears to be the cause of the die-back disease.","Jami, F; Marincowitz, S; Slippers, B; Wingfield, MJ",AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY,2018,10.1007/s13313-018-0586-4,0.907096287693443,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995805820869944,0.00419417913005625,0.999999999991115,8.88533691068005e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

However, the impacts of decades of continued fertilization on root microbiomes, and their link with ongoing crop production, remain poorly understood. Here, we used a four decade-long fertilization experiment, including contrasting types of organic and inorganic fertil-ization, to investigate the effects of long-term fertilization on multi-kingdom root endophytic microbiomes, including keystone species (modules within microbial networks), and their indirect associations with the production of wheat, which is one of the most important crops worldwide. We found that long-term inorganic (nitrogen, phosphorus, potas-sium (NPK)) and organic (NPK with straw (NPKS) and NPK with cow manure (NPKM)) fertilization had significant impacts on the community composition of endophytic arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), bacteria, and non-mycorrhizal fungi. In addition, compared with NPK fertilization, NPKS and NPKM amendments significantly decreased the microbial network complexity, which was associated with changes in the root iron content. Finally, we identified an important subset of keystone root endophyte species within the microbial network (Module #2), which was positively correlated with wheat yield, and affected by changes in root carbon to phosphorus ratio. This study provides evidence that long-term fertilization can affect keystone root endophytic species in the root microbiome, with implications for food security in an over-fertilized world.","Ma, YY; Wang, DZ; Guo, XS; Zhu, YG; Delgado-Baquerizo, M; Chu, HY",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,2022,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.157407,0.730106061978839,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.898749711468918,0.101250288531082,0.999999999999028,9.72111280361787e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

This fungus has also been reported as a dominant endophytic species in plants of the sedge Carex brevicollis growing in the understory of beech forests and adjacent grasslands in Sierra de Urbasa (Navarre, Spain). In this area, stromata of B.nummularia were observed in dead and living wood of beech trees at several locations where plants of C.brevicollis also contained the fungus as an endophyte. Pure cultures obtained from stromata of B.nummularia on F.sylvatica trees were compared to endophytic isolates from symptomless C.brevicollis. Culture morphology and micromorphology as well as rDNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions were identical, suggesting that B.nummularia from beech can also live endophytically in C.brevicollis. It is unknown whether the endophytic strains of Carex might have a role as an inoculum source for the infection of beech trees, or whether they represent a dead end in the life cycle of the fungus.","Zabalgogeazcoa, I; Pedro, J; Canals, RM",FOREST PATHOLOGY,2015,10.1111/efp.12202,0.824640060326884,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.981856110973982,0.0181438890260179,0.999999788446877,2.11553122575481e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
17726,Impact of seed-transmitted endophytic bacteria on intra- and inter-cultivar plant growth promotion modulated by certain sets of metabolites in rice crop.,"Exploring the beneficial interactions between plant and endophytes could be an effective strategy in the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices to enhance crop productivity. In this study, we aimed to evaluate holistically the plant growth promoting (PGP) abilities rendered by seed-transmitted endophytic bacteria isolated from in vitro grown calli of two rice cultivars. Nine bacterial endophytes, designated as PB001-PB009, were isolated and identified at the genus level through 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Biochemical investigations disclosed that they possess several PGP traits, such as phosphate solubilization, indole acetic acid biosynthesis, ammonia production, nitrogen fixation, amylase production and siderophore production. Results in gnotobiotic conditions revealed an increase in fresh weight, dry weight, root length and shoot length of seedlings germinated from endophyte-primed seeds than the control (uninoculated) set in a non-host and two host rice cultivars. In net house experiments, plants germinated from Micrococcus sp. PB001, Pseudomonas sp. PB002, Methylobacterium sp. PB005 and Methylorubrum sp. PB009 primed seeds showed an increase of upto 34.06 %, 38.77 %, 182.87 %, 16.59 % and 33.52 % in chlorophyll content, number of tillers/plant, number of grains/plant, grain size and grain weight, respectively than control plant sets in the non-host rice cultivar, further validating inter-cultivar PGP abilities of these endophytes. Metabolite profiling unfolded the abundance of few metabolites that are involved in pathways associated with PGP traits, in seedlings germinated from the endophyte-primed seeds. Together, the study documents the effect of seed-transmitted endophytic bacteria on intra- and inter-cultivar PGP by modulating certain sets of metabolites in rice plant, and is promising in developing bioinoculant formulations employing these selected endophytes for enhancement of rice productivity.",Krishnamoorthy A; Agarwal T; Kotamreddy JNR; Bhattacharya R; Mitra A; Maiti TK; Maiti MK,Microbiological research,2020,10.1016/j.micres.2020.126582,0.891969987890712,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.875510122079057,0.124489877920943,0.999988821326252,1.11786737481134e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

The objective of this work was to evaluate the management of fungicides with sequential applications to control Asian soybean rust. The experimental design used was a randomized block with four replications and eight treatments with different combinations of fungicides from the following chemical groups: triazole, strobilurin, carboxamide, and dithiocarbamate. The applications were carried out with backpack spray equipment at constant pressure (CO2) and a spray rate of 200 L ha(-1). The severity of rust, the area under the disease progress curve, control efficiency, mass of 1,000 grains, and productivity were evaluated. The protective fungicide mancozeb, in mixtures with systemic fungicides, were more effective for the control of Asian soybean rust than the systemic fungicides applied without the protective fungicide.","Neto, ALV; De Souza, CMA; Bertoncello, BF; de Lima, ID; Piletti, LMMD; Rigotte, MR",REVISTA AGROGEOAMBIENTAL,2021,10.18406/2316-1817v13n120211535,0.953140171412733,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.986598442895531,0.0134015571044689,0.999999717818863,2.82181136568305e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
634,Allelopathic potential of root endophytic fungal metabolites of Casuarina equisetifolia,"In order to explore whether endophytic fungi of Casuarina equisetifolia L. are involved in allelopathy, we investigated their diversity and composition of their metabolites. By Illumina Miseq high-throughput sequencing platform, a total of 318,972 sequences were obtained from 9 root samples of C. equisetifolia of different ages, which included 11 phyla, 32 families and 32 genera. Four fungi were isolated from the roots by the traditional method and identified by biolog microbial automatic analysis system as Aspergillus aculeatus lzuka, Penicillium melinii Thom, Neosartorya fisccheri (Wehmer) Malloch & Cain BGA and Penicillium solitum Westling BGB. Pyrogallic acid, dodecanoic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid, 2,4-Di-tert-butylphenol, 1,2,3,4-butanetetrol and globulol and other organic compounds were identified in the fermentation broths of four endophytic fungi by GC-MS analysis. Among them, 2, 4-Ditert-butylphenol, 1,2,3,4-butanetetrol and globulol were also found in soil, root and litter extract. These results imply that root-endophytic fungi are involved in the synthesis of substances that affect the host plants.

2881,Metagenomic Analysis of Bacterial and Fungal Community Composition Associated with Paulownia elongata x Paulownia fortunei,"The dynamics and interactions of microbial communities in Paulownia's life cycle are poorly understood. The main goal of this study was to compare the rhizospheric soil and endophytic microbiome and mycobiome of hybrid Paulownia elongata and Paulownia fortunei. The comparison was based on highly efficient Illumina MiSeq sequencing of bacteria and fungi from the rhizosphere and endosphere of bioenergetic trees P. elongata x P. fortunei. The general richness of bacteria and rhizospheric fungi (based on Chao 1, Shannon, and Simpson indicators) was higher than in endosphere samples from the same plants. Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were dominant in the rhizosphere and endosphere of plants in healthy conditions. The rhizosphere fungal communities in both trials were dominated by Ascomycota, Mortierellomycota, and Basidiomycota. Most root endophytes came from Olpidiomycota, Oomycota, and Ascomycota, while most leaf endophytes were from Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. This study was the first report on the composition of bacteria and fungi associated with the endosphere and rhizosphere of Paulownia trees. These studies showed that bacterial and fungal communities from the rhizosphere and endosphere were separate communities. It also showed that the health conditions of trees did not affect the composition of endophytic microorganisms in Paulownia tissues.","Wozniak, M; Grzadziel, J; Galazka, A; Frac, M",BIORESOURCES,2019,10.15376/biores.14.4.8511-8529,0.946297334865746,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.93285821939954106,0.0671417806004595,0.999989065369928,1.09346300724011e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2133,The enhancement of invasion ability of an annual grass by its fungal endophyte depends on recipient community structure,"Most terrestrial plants establish symbiotic associations with microorganisms that enable them to overcome abiotic or biotic filters in ecosystems. Here we investigated how aerial mutualisms involving invasive species may affect the recipient community's structure. We hypothesized that the endophyte Epichloe occultans enhances the ability of Lolium multiflorum to establish and colonize, but that success would depend on the structure and invasion resistance of the recipient grassland community. Seeds of L. multiflorum with high (E+) and low (E-) endophyte incidence were sown in plots located in grasslands with or without recent grazing history. Relative cover of L. multiflorum and floristic groups was determined during the growing season. Whereas we did not detect any endophyte effect in sites with grazing history, L. multiflorum cover was 63 % in E+ and 27 % in E- plots in sites without grazing history. As cover of L. multiflorum increased in these sites, the cover of warm- and cool-season grasses decreased in spring, with that of warm-season grasses continuing to decrease in summer. These decreases corresponded to 1.9, 3.7 and 1.6 %, for every % increase of L. multiflorum cover. Path analysis and posterior modelling predicted a greater impact of the endophyte on L. multiflorum cover than of seed addition when resident L. multiflorum cover was <= 20 %. This effect decreased asymptotically as L. multiflorum cover increased beyond 20 %. Our results suggest that the endophyte may boost the invasion ability of L. multiflorum particularly in natural grassland without grazing history with potential longer-term consequences for community structure and dynamics.","Casas, C; Gundel, PE; Semmartin, M; Schnyder, H; Omacini, M",BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,2016,10.1007/s10530-016-1129-y,0.987401054676622,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993106309752718,0.00689369024728182,0.998725961937519,0.00127403806248083,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2962,Involvement of Dactylonectria and Ilyonectria spp. in tree decline affecting multi-generation apple orchards,"Background This study started from typical replant disease symptoms limited to specific foci within three multi-generation orchards showing homogeneous growth. Methods A plant growth assay was conducted using soil from symptomatic and asymptomatic tree root zones along planted rows and from strip-rows. Root colonizing fungal communities were investigated, then the study turned to pathogenicity of Cylindrocarpon-like fungi (Dactylonectria and Ilyonectria spp) and their extracellular exudates. Results Growth of apple rootstock plantlets in soil from symptomatic trees was significantly lower than in those observed in soil from asymptomatic trees and from strip-rows. Among the main group of endophytic filamentous fungi isolated from roots, Cylindrocapon-like fungi (Dactylonectria torresensis and, to a lesser extent, Ilyonectria robusta), along with binucleate Rhizoctonia spp., prevailed mostly in plantlets grown in soil collected from planted rows. On the other hand, Fusarium spp. prevailed in plantlets grown in soil from the strip-rows. Cylindrocarpon-like fungi was found to be the most negatively correlated with plant growth. As findings of artificial inoculation with main root colonizing fungal species were not in line with what was observed in native soils, a further investigation was performed on secondary metabolites through which Dactylonectria torresensis exerts pathogenicity; this analysis revealed that both phytotoxins (tentoxin, HC toxin and zearalenone) and cytotoxic compounds (rabelomycin and nidulin) may be involved. Conclusion Findings suggest that extracellular compounds released by D. torresensis may have contributed to the severe growth reduction associated with replant disease-like symptoms.","Manici, LM; Kelderer, M; Caputo, F; Saccà, ML; Nicoletti, F; Topp, AR; Mazzola, M",PLANT AND SOIL,2018,10.1007/s11104-018-3571-3,0.998834342913529,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.9675096632455,0.0324903367545002,0.999999997831526,2.16847362288775e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11487,"Microcosm-based analyses of Scots pine seedling growth, ectomycorrhizal fungal community structure and bacterial carbon utilization profiles in boreal forest humus and underlying illuvial mineral horizons","We report on the identity of indigenous mycorrhiza forming fungi and rhizosphere/mycorrhizosphere bacterial community carbon source utilization profiles of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L,) seedlings grown in boreal forest humus (O) or illuvial (B) mineral horizon containing microcosm growth systems. Based on rDNA (ITS)-RFLP analyses, a total of 10 fungal RFLP taxa were identified from pre-morphotyped mycorrhizas on 7-month-old seedling roots. Hierarchical cluster analysis, including corresponding RFLPs of known fungal species, confirmed root colonization by eight mycorrhizal species. In the O horizon, roots were colonized by e.g. Suillus bovinus, Suillus variegatus, Cenococcum geophilum, Piloderma croceum, Thelephora terrestris and Russula vinicolor. Mycobiont diversity in the mineral B horizon was lower but included Piceirhiza bicolorata and both Suillus species which produced extensive extramatrical mycelium. In comparison to noncolonized soils, rhizosphere and mycorrhizosphere compartments supported significantly higher numbers of bacteria (mean range 10(8)-10(11) cells g(-1) fresh weight (fw)) Specific rhizosphere/mycorrhizosphere 'niche'-linked bacterial communities were detected following multivariate analyses (PCA and CA) of bacterial carbon utilization profiles (Biolog (R) GN microplate). Distinct preferences for amino and carboxylic acids were identified in mineral B horizon rhizospheres whereas a wider range of carbon sources were utilized in the fungal-dominated mycorrhizospheres irrespective of soil types.

18408,Fine root endophytes under scrutiny: a review of the literature on arbuscule-producing fungi recently suggested to belong to the Mucoromycotina.,"Fine root endophytes (FRE) are arbuscule-forming fungi presently considered as a single species-Glomus tenue in the Glomeromycota (Glomeromycotina)-but probably belong within the Mucoromycotina. Thus, FRE are the only known arbuscule-forming fungi not within the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF; Glomeromycotina) as currently understood. Phylogenetic differences between FRE and AMF could reflect ecological differences. To synthesize current ecological knowledge, we reviewed the literature on FRE and identified 108 papers that noted the presence of FRE and, in some, the colonization levels for FRE or AMF (or both). We categorized these records by geographic region, host-plant family and environment (agriculture, moderate-natural, low-temperature, high-altitude and other) and determined their influence on the percentage of root length colonized by FRE in a meta-analysis. We found that FRE are globally distributed, with many observations from Poaceae, perhaps due to grasses being widely distributed. In agricultural environments, colonization by FRE often equalled or exceeded that of AMF, particularly in Australasia. In moderate-natural and high-altitude environments, average colonization by FRE (~10%) was lower than that of AMF (~35%), whereas in low-temperature environments, colonization was similar (~20%). Several studies suggested that FRE can enhance host-plant phosphorus uptake and growth, and may be more resilient than AMF to environmental stress in some host plants. Further research is required on the functioning of FRE in relation to the environment, host plant and co-occurring AMF and, in particular, to examine whether FRE are important for plant growth in stressful environments.

13811,Nickel in plant growth and metabolism,"The relationship of nickel to plants in regard to absorption, translocation and accumulation and its estimation in plant material has been presented. Nickel is usually absorbed in the ionic form, but is presumably chelated by organic carriers before translocation takes place. Nickel content of various plants has been tabulated. Nickel stimulates, and is as well toxic to, the germination of some seeds. It regulates the mineral metabolism, enzyme activity and several other metabolic processes in plants. It causes mitotic disturbances in root tips of some plants. Nickel salts are the best systemic fungicides. It is used as a fungicide mainly for the control of cereal rusts both because of its protective and eradicative properties. At the nonphytotoxic levels, nickel increases the yield of some crops.

5630,"Isolation, characterization and management of endophyte(s) prevailing during the in vitro establishment of endangered medicinal herb Himalayan Trillium (Trillium govanianum Wall. ex D. Don)","Endophytes are the microorganisms (fungi or bacteria) that usually live within plant tissues without showing symptoms of disease. In most cases, these endophytes exhibit a symbiotic relationship with the host plant, but in tissue culture procedures, these endophytes overgrow in established cultures, thus hindering the practice of in vitro establishment. Such endophytic growth, which mainly involves the growth of endophytic bacteria, has an undesirable impact on the in vitro establishment of the endangered medicinal herb Himalayan Trillium (Trillium govanianum). Therefore, this study aimed at the isolation, characterization, and management of such endophyte(s) prevalent during in vitro establishment. Tryptic soy agar has been reported to be a suitable medium for the growth of endophytic bacteria as it supports the growth of a wide range of bacteria. Five endophytic bacteria were identified, namely Pseudomonas migulae UHF-TGN4 (Accession no. OP518462), Agrobacterium radiobacter UHF-TGNRH (Accession no. OP518463), Enterobacter hormaechei subsp. hoffmannii UHF-TGTSR (Accession no. OP518464), Pseudomonas umsongensis UHF-TGTS5 (Accession no. OP518467) and Pseudomonas kielensis UHF-TG8RH (Accession no. OP518468) were identified based on morphological, biochemical and molecular characterization. These isolates were deposited at the National Centre for Microbial Resource, Pune, Maharashtra, India for further maintenance. Various antibiotics, such as streptomycin, amikacin, kanamycin, gentamicin, tetracycline, cefotaxime, cotrimoxazole, and ampicillin were used to study their effectiveness in controlling bacterial growth. Out of these, three antibiotics namely, streptomycin, cefotaxime and tetracycline were selected on the basis of their efficacy for zone of inhibition. The antibiotic cefotaxime at a concentration of 120 mg/L was found effective during the in vitro establishment practices. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the identification and management of endophytic bacteria during in vitro establishment Himalayan Trillium. These findings could help in maintaining healthy in vitro cultures of this valuable and endangered medicinal herb for its mass propagation and conservation aspects.","Chaudhary, D; Kumar, V; Sharma, R; Devi, S; Sharma, P; Kumar, P",PLANT CELL TISSUE AND ORGAN CULTURE,2024,10.1007/s11240-023-02647-8,0.909228420946802,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.967180497928258,0.0328195020717421,0.999888097573003,1.1190242699699e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19707,High-throughput sequencing-based analysis of the composition and diversity of endophytic bacterial community in seeds of saline-alkali tolerant rice.,"The study of endophytic bacteria in saline-alkali tolerant rice seeds is of great help to the follow-up study of saline-alkali tolerant mechanism and the exploitation of saline-alkali tolerant microbial resources. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology based on the Illumina Miseq platform was used to reveal the ""core microbiota"" by examining the diversity and community structures of seed endophytic bacteria in saline-alkali tolerant rice grown under different salt concentrations and explore the effect of salt concentration on its endophytic bacteria. Here, 49 endophytic OTUs were found to coexist in all samples. At the phylum level, the dominant phyla were Proteobacteria (83.90 %-99.87 %). At the genus level, Pantoea (44.65-94.76 %) which represents the core microbiota in saline-alkali tolerant rice seeds, served as the dominant genus that coexisted in all samples tested. Through further analysis, we found that the abundance of Pantoea in saline-alkali tolerant rice seeds was positively proportional to the level of salt concentration. Overall, this study showed that the core microbiota of saline-alkali tolerant rice seeds is Pantoea, and the change of salt concentration is a key factor in the formation of endophytic bacteria in saline-alkali tolerant rice seeds.",Wang Z; Zhu Y; Li N; Liu H; Zheng H; Wang W; Liu Y,Microbiological research,2021,10.1016/j.micres.2021.126794,0.953545866544455,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.561607371497479,0.438392628502521,0.99998594426327,1.40557367299676e-5,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
2410,Epichloe uncinata Infection and Loline Content Protect Festulolium Grasses From Crickets (Orthoptera: Gryllidae),"Experiments with artificial diets demonstrated that black field cricket (Teleogryllus commodus (Walker)) and Lepidogryllus sp. were highly responsive to presence of lolines in their diet- quantities of diet consumed declined exponentially with increasing loline concentration. Amount consumed by black field cricket and Lepidogryllus sp. on diet containing 5,600 mu g/g lolines was only 8 and 2% relative to those on loline-free diet, respectively. Additional experiments with Festulolium seeds demonstrated that both cricket species predated heavily on endophyte-free seed but largely avoided Epichloe uncinata-infected seed. By 12 h, black field cricket had destroyed 98.8% of endophyte-free but only 24.8% of E. uncinata-infected, loline-containing seed. By 36 h, Lepidogryllus sp. crickets had destroyed 40% of endophyte-free but had not fed on E. uncinata-infected, loline-containing seed. Glasshouse experiments demonstrated this aversion to lolines greatly reduces the damage potential of black field cricket in E. uncinata-infected Festulolium. When microswards were sown with E. uncinata-infected Festulolium, seedling numbers were reduced 25-26%, and yields 29-40%, by black field crickets relative to microswards sown without insect infestation. This contrasts with 70-78% reduction in seedling numbers and 67-80% reduction in yields in microswards sown to either endophyte-free Festulolium, endophyte-free perennial ryegrass, or Epichloe festucae var. lolii-infected Festulolium. Yields of mature E. uncinata-infected Festulolium plants were not adversely affected by black field crickets, irrespective of the presence of the endophyte-free standard Festulolium sown as a companion. In contrast, yields of endophyte-free Festulolium, endophyte-free perennial ryegrass, and E. festucae var. lolii-infected Festulolium plants were reduced by 56-61% by crickets.","Barker, GM; Patchett, BJ; Cameron, NE",JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY,2015,10.1093/jee/tou058,0.877883465065421,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.856350860253444,0.143649139746556,0.999997367408575,2.63259142485595e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
5145,Effect of habitat disturbance on inoculum potential of ericoid endophytes of Western Australian heaths (Epacridaceae),"The presence of host plants was found to be a key determinant of soil infectivity for endophytes of epacrids growing in south-west Australian jarrah forest carrying a sparse epacrid understorey. A comparable Banksia woodland with higher density of epacrids showed more uniform levels of infective endophytes, presumably because of closer overlap of host-supported patches of endophyte. Disturbed sites in jarrah forest, in which topsoil had been recently returned following bauxite mining, initially showed extremely low endophyte infectivity, probably due to disruption of the hyphal network, absence of host plants and/or increased competition from soil micro-organisms antagonistic to the endophytes. As the system stabilized and epacrids recruited and grew, inoculum potential of the soil re-established and by 12 yr it equalled that of adjacent undisturbed native forest. At disturbed sites with sparsely distributed adult members of the Epacridaceae, endophyte inoculum proved to be adequate only directly adjacent to the epacrids and declined steeply to negligible levels at only 40 cm radially distant from a host plant. The significance of live epacrid root systems on survival of endophyte inoculum in Banksia woodland was examined following removal of shoots of adult plants of the endemic epacrid, Leucopogon conostephioides DC. Coincident with demise of roots of the detopped plants, endophyte inoculum potential of closely adjacent soil declined by 50 % during the growing season. However, the effect was short lived and infectivity rose the following year to equal that of undisturbed adjacent woodland as mycelial matrices supported by neighbouring epacrids invaded the depleted study areas.","Hutton, BJ; Dixon, KW; Sivasithamparam, K; Pate, JS",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,1997,10.1046/j.1469-8137.1997.00708.x,0.960550092139714,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.953896075202538,0.0461039247974622,0.999992738611018,7.26138898199391e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
4509,Analysis of differential effects of host plants on the gut microbes of Rhoptroceros cyatheae,"As an indispensable part of insects, intestinal symbiotic bacteria play a vital role in the growth and development of insects and their adaptability. Rhoptroceros cyatheae, the main pest of the relict plant Alsophila spinulosa, poses a serious threat to the development of the A. spinulosa population. In the present study, 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer high-throughput sequencing techniques were used to analyze the structure of intestinal microbes and the diversity of the insect feeding on two different plants, as well as the similarities between the intestinal microorganisms of R. cyatheae. The dominant bacteria of leaf endophytes were also compared based on the sequencing data. The results showed that Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were the dominant phyla of intestinal bacteria, and Ascomycota was the dominant phylum of intestinal fungi. Allorhizobium-Neorhizobium-Pararhizobium-Rhizobium, Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum, and Enterococcus were the dominant genera in the intestine of R. cyatheae feeding on two plants, and the relative abundance was significantly different between the two groups. Candida was the common dominant genus of intestinal fungi in the two groups, and no significant difference was observed in its abundance between the two groups. This showed that compared with the intestinal fungi of R. cyatheae, the abundance of the intestinal bacteria was greatly affected by food. The common core microbiota between the microorganisms in A. spinulosa leaves and the insect gut indicated the presence of a microbial exchange between the two. The network correlation diagram showed that the gut microbes of R. cyatheae feeding on Gymnosphaera metteniana were more closely related to each other, which could help the host to better cope with the adverse external environment. This study provides a theoretical basis for the adaptation mechanism of R. cyatheae and a new direction for the effective prevention and control of R. cyatheae.","Zhang, BC; Yang, WC; He, QQ; Chen, HD; Che, BJ; Bai, XJ",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2024,10.3389/fmicb.2024.1392586,0.992890443361487,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991846761177453,0.00815323882254722,0.999999999207679,7.92320986597872e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18872,Bacillus endophytes for sustainable management of tomato spotted wilt virus and yield production.,"Tomato-spotted wilt virus (TSWV) from the Tospovirus genus affects over 1000 plant species, including key crops, and traditional control methods often prove inadequate. This study investigates the effectiveness of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens and Bacillus subtilis in reducing TSWV infection, enhancing plant growth, and strengthening defense in Nicotiana benthamiana. The aim is to assess Bacillus as a sustainable biocontrol alternative, offering an eco-friendly solution for managing TSWV disease in agriculture. Here, we report the efficacy of five Bacillus isolates (out of 15 tested) - B. amyloliquefaciens (DJB5, YN48, YN28, Mg6) and B. subtilis L1-21 - significantly reducing TSWV copies per gram in N. benthamiana leaves, using a half-leaf assay. In glasshouse trials, isolates DJB5, YN48, and Mg6 decreased TSWV copies per gram by 75.7%, 83.6%, and 88.2%, with biocontrol efficacy rates of 91.2%, 94.1%, and 95.7% respectively. All the isolates consistently mitigated the symptoms of TSWV, reduced the disease severity, and area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) at 21 days post-inoculation. Additionally, these isolates enhanced plant growth parameters, including shoot and root length, leaf number, area, and biomass. The application of endophytes in the infected plants activated antioxidant defense enzymes by elevating the activities of polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and chitinase. However, defense-related enzymes, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), total phenol, and β-1,3-glucanase decreased as TSWV infection reduced in the leaves. Our findings indicate that B. amyloliquefaciens isolates, DJB5, YN48, and Mg6, effectively manage TSWV by activating plant defense, reducing virus load, reducing TSWV symptoms, and promoting plant growth. © 2024 Society of Chemical Industry.",Khan R; He P; Chen X; He P; Ahmed A; Wu Y; Tang G; Tang P; Li X; Munir S; He Y,Pest management science,2025,10.1002/ps.8606,0.967812589005338,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996218208873918,0.00378179112608222,0.999999991216456,8.783543892221251e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15483,Biofumigation activities of volatile compounds from two Trichoderma afroharzianum strains against Fusarium infections in fresh chilies,"BACKGROUND: Two Fusarium fungi, F. oxysporum and F. proliferatum, have been recognized as major pathogenic fungi that cause postharvest decay of chili fruits. Ozone and some toxic chemicals are used to control pathogenic infections, leading to longer storage lives of agricultural commodities. However, these chemicals may pose some risks to the applicators and the environment. Therefore, alternative, easy-to-use fumigants for effective control of Fusarium infections in harvested fresh chilies are needed. RESULTS: Two endophytic fungi, Trichoderma afroharzianum strain MFLUCC19-0090 and T. afroharzianum strain MFLUCC19-0091, were isolated from Schefflera leucantha leaves. Their volatile compounds were investigated for antifungal activities against F. oxysporum and F. proliferatum. In vitro results showed that the volatile compounds produced by each strain inhibited pathogen growth. Additionally, the Trichoderma-derived volatile compounds significantly reduced Fusarium-related disease severity and incidence percentages in the inoculated fresh chilies. Antifungal properties of the volatile compounds were found to be specific to the species of the tested pathogens (MFLUCC19-0090 greatly suppressed F. oxysporum and MFLUCC19-0091 greatly suppressed F. proliferatum). Seventy-three volatile compounds were detected from both strains. Among the major volatile compounds detected, phenyl ethyl alcohol was found to possess the strongest antifungal activity against both pathogens. CONCLUSION: These Trichoderma-derived volatile compounds may be used as alternative fumigants for controlling Fusarium rot in harvested fresh chilies. The successful use of volatile compounds as biofumigants can prevent significant market losses and, more importantly, may reduce the health hazards caused by Fusarium-associated mycotoxin exposures among consumers. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.",Khruengsai S.; Pripdeevech P.; D'Souza P.E.; Panuwet P.,Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture,2021,10.1002/jsfa.11238,0.96977062948123,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.689183951064478,0.310816048935522,0.999999904553696,9.54463037494691e-8,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
12388,Phylogeny and taxonomy of obscure genera of microfungi,"The recently generated molecular phylogeny for the kingdom Fungi, on which anew classification scheme is based, still suffers from an under representation of numerous apparently asexual genera of microfungi. In an attempt to populate the Fungal Tree of Life, fresh samples of 10 obscure genera of hyphomycetes were collected. These fungi were subsequently established in culture, and subjected to DNA sequence analysis of the ITS and LSU nrRNA genes to resolve species and generic questions related to these obscure genera. Brycekendrickomyces (Herpotrichiellaceae) is introduced as a new genus similar to, but distinct from Haplographium and Lauriomyces. Chalastospora is shown to be a genus in the Pleosporales, with two new species, C. ellipsoidea and C. obclavata, to which Alternaria malorum is added as an additional taxon under its oldest epithet, C. gossypii. Cyphellophora eugeniae is newly described in Cyphellophora (Herpotrichiellaceae), and distinguished from other taxa in the genus. Dictyosporium is placed in the Pleosporates, with one new species, D. streliziae. The genus Edenia, which was recently introduced for a sterile endophytic fungus isolated in Mexico, is shown to be a hyphomycete (Pleosporales) forming a pyronellea-like synanamorph in culture. Thedgionia is shown not to represent an anamorph of Mycosphaerella, but to belong to the Helotiales. Trochophora, however, clustered basal to the Pseudocercospora complex in the Mycosphaerellaceae, as did Verrucisporota. Vonarxia, a rather forgotten genus of hyphomycetes, is shown to belong to the Herpotrichiellaceae and Xenostigmina is confirmed as synanamorph of Mycopappus, and is shown to be allied to Seifertia in the Pleosporales. Dichotomous keys are provided for species in the various genera treated. Furthermore, several families are shown to be polyphyletic within some orders, especially in the Capnodiales, Chaetothyriales and Pleosporales.","Crous, PW; Braun, U; Wingfield, MJ; Wood, AR; Shin, HD; Summerell, BA; Alfenas, AC; Cumagun, CJR; Grohenewald, JZ",PERSOONIA,2009,10.3767/003158509X461701,0.888469864035875,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999773675278379,2.2632472162064e-4,0.999999999964108,3.58919560738968e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Plants were grown under controlled environmental conditions for 10 weeks and were subjected to: i) no stress (12 mM of N; no limiting water supply); ii) N deficiency; or iii) drought stress. In the absence of stress, infected and non-infected plants of all clones showed similar growth rates. Under N deficiency (2.33 mM), infected plants had 27% more tillers and 15% less dead leaves than uninfected plants, and they maintained their photosynthetic level. During drought stress (0.7 MPa), the osmotic potential of the infected plants was 13% lower than that of uninfected plants and their tiller number was 10% greater than that of non-infected plants at the end of the drought stress period. Thus, in the three clones studied, the infection results in increased tolerance of host plants to abiotic stress especially as a result of better tillering.","Ravel, C; Courty, C; Coudret, A; Charmet, G",AGRONOMIE,1997,10.1051/agro:19970304,0.975256379749838,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.953579908853747,0.0464200911462528,0.999990683746615,9.31625338462805e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

8872,Quantitative assessment of in planta distribution of metabolic activity and gene expression of an endophytic fungus,"Using perennial ryegrass infected with an Acremonium transformant carrying the Escherichia coli beta-D-glucuronidase gene (gusA) (GUS system) under control of a constitutive promoter, we have developed methods for the quantitative extraction of endophyte-associated GUS activity from plant material. Fluorometric assays of these extracts allow quantitative assessment of the distribution of endophyte-associated GUS activity within single plants (tillers) with high resolution. Fluorescence microscopy with the dye Imagene Green can in addition visualize individual GUS-expressing hyphae. Since the transformant expresses the GUS gene constitutively, GUS activity can be used as an indicator of in planta endophyte metabolic activity. Using this approach we found that (i) the concentration of endophyte metabolic activity in plant tissue decreases with increasing plant size, (ii) approximately 70% of endophyte metabolic activity present in a plant is located in the leaf sheaths, (iii) basal-apical gradients and lateral (younger to older tissue) gradients of endophyte metabolic activity exist and (iv) basal-apical gradients are established early in leaf development. Our data suggest that the concentration of endophyte in each part of the plant is regulated so that a predetermined threshold of total endophyte activity per plant is not exceeded and a consistent distribution pattern is maintained.","Herd, S; Christensen, MJ; Saunders, K; Scott, DB; Schmid, J",MICROBIOLOGY-SGM,1997,10.1099/00221287-143-1-267,0.614761785704319,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.983752231667452,0.0162477683325476,0.999997442859765,2.55714023478237e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

In this study, it was found that the proliferation of HepG2 HCC cells was significant inhibited by the incubation with aspergillumarin A at 200 mu mol/L. Using flow cytometry, the cell cycle arrest at G(0)/G(1) phase was found to contribute to the inhibitory effect of aspergillumarin A. Further, the dysregulation of cyclins was observed in the results of real-time PCR and western blotting.

4671,Synergism among volatile organic compounds resulting in increased antibiosis in Oidium sp.,"Oidium sp. has been recovered as an endophyte in Terminalia catappa (tropical chestnut) in Costa Rica. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of this organism uniquely and primarily consist of esters of propanoic acid, 2-methyl-, butanoic acid, 2-methyl-, and butanoic acid, 3-methyl-. The VOCs of Oidium sp. are slightly inhibitory to many plant pathogenic fungi. Previous work on the VOCs of Muscodor albus demonstrated that besides esters of small organic acids, a small organic acid and a naphthalene derivative were needed to obtain maximum antibiotic activity. Thus, the addition of exogenous volatile compounds such as isobutyric acid and naphthalene, 1,1'-oxybis caused a dramatic synergistic increase in the antibiotic activity of the VOCs of Oidium sp. against Pythium ultimum. In fact, at elevated concentrations, there was not only 100% inhibition of P. ultimum but killing as well. In addition, a coculture of Muscodor vitigenus (making only naphthalene) and Oidium sp. plus isobutyric acid produced an additive antibiosis effect against P. ultimum.

Here, we show that the plant microbiota plays an important role in this process. The endophytic Sporobolomyces ruberrimus isolated from a serpentine population of Arabidopsis arenosa protected plants against excess metals. Coculture with its native host and Arabidopsis thaliana inhibited Fe and Ni uptake. It had no effect on host Zn and Cd uptake. Fe uptake inhibition was confirmed in wheat and rape. Our investigations show that, for the metal inhibitory effect, the interference of microorganisms in plant ethylene homeostasis is necessary. Application of an ethylene synthesis inhibitor, as well as loss-of-function mutations in canonical ethylene signalling genes, prevented metal uptake inhibition by the fungus. Coculture with S. ruberrimus significantly changed the expression of Fe homeostasis genes: IRT1, OPT3, OPT6, bHLH38 and bHLH39 in wild-type (WT) A. thaliana. The expression pattern of these genes in WT plants and in the ethylene signalling defective mutants significantly differed and coincided with the plant accumulation phenotype. Most notably, down-regulation of the expression of IRT1 solely in WT was necessary for the inhibition of metal uptake in plants. This study shows that microorganisms optimize plant Fe and Ni uptake by fine-tuning plant metal homeostasis.","Domka, A; Jedrzejczyk, R; Wazny, R; Gustab, M; Kowalski, M; Nosek, M; Bizan, J; Puschenreiter, M; Vaculik, M; Kovác, J; Rozpadek, P",PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT,2023,10.1111/pce.14473,0.552250354344109,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.952196194917146,0.0478038050828541,0.999999456632118,5.4336788157805e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
18320,Bacterial Endophyte Colonization and Distribution within Plants.,"The plant endosphere contains a diverse group of microbial communities. There is general consensus that these microbial communities make significant contributions to plant health. Both recently adopted genomic approaches and classical microbiology techniques continue to develop the science of plant-microbe interactions. Endophytes are microbial symbionts residing within the plant for the majority of their life cycle without any detrimental impact to the host plant. The use of these natural symbionts offers an opportunity to maximize crop productivity while reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture. Endophytes promote plant growth through nitrogen fixation, phytohormone production, nutrient acquisition, and by conferring tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Colonization by endophytes is crucial for providing these benefits to the host plant. Endophytic colonization refers to the entry, growth and multiplication of endophyte populations within the host plant. Lately, plant microbiome research has gained considerable attention but the mechanism allowing plants to recruit endophytes is largely unknown. This review summarizes currently available knowledge about endophytic colonization by bacteria in various plant species, and specifically discusses the colonization of maize plants by Populus endophytes.",Kandel SL; Joubert PM; Doty SL,Microorganisms,2017,10.3390/microorganisms5040077,0.945816957391418,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.393072140784427,0.606927859215573,0.994824995338055,0.00517500466194531,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

4317,Investigating plant growth promoting and antifungal potential of Metarhizium spp. against Fusarium wilt in tomato,"Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, , the causal agent of tomato Fusarium wilt, is an important soil-borne pathogen responsible for severe losses and reduction in total yield both in fields and in greenhouses. While fungicides are, the most effective, prolonged use raises concerns about human health and environmental burdens. This research aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect of Metarhizium spp. against Fusarium wilt disease under laboratory and greenhouse conditions. The results revealed that Metarhizium sp. Me351 could produce indole-3-acetic acid and produce hydrolytic enzymes (beta-1,3-glucanase, pectinase, and catalase). Similarly, significant bio-- control efficacy was observed, with reductions of up to 0.3 cm in diameter achieved by Metarhizium sp. Me351 in terms of inhibiting the mycelial growth of pathogenic fungi under laboratory conditions. This translates to a 6.98% decrease in F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici growth relative to the untreated control (100%). In greenhouse trials, preventive treatments using Metarhizium sp. Me351 enhanced tomato seedling growth compared to the positive control. Increases were ob-- served in various parameters: 66.81% (plant length), 27.15-11.85% (fresh and dry weights of the aerial part system), 49.18% (root length), and 55.74-12.64% (fresh and dry weights of the root system). Additionally, tomato plants treated with Metarhizium sp. Me351 and inoculated with pathogenic fungi showed significant increases in chlorophyll a (2.77 mg g-1 fresh weight), b (1.24 mg g-1 fresh weight), and total chlorophyll content (4.01 mg g-1 fresh weight). This treatment also exhib-- ited heightened activity levels of catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, polyphenol-oxidase, and total phenolic content. The minimum disease severity index (18.33%) was recorded under this treatment condition. It was concluded that Metarhizium sp. Me351 can potentially be used to reduce Fusarium wilt and promote plant growth of tomato.","Rhouma, A; Hajji-Hedfi, L; Kouadri, ME; Chihani-Hammas, N; Khaire, PB",NOVA HEDWIGIA,2024,10.1127/nova_hedwigia/2024/0958,0.971000901538523,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.972469802965889,0.0275301970341112,0.999943278304976,5.67216950244642e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

At present, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has listed bird strike disaster as ""A-type aviation disaster"", and the research on bird strike prevention has gradually attracted attentions. The symbionts formed by Epichloë endophyte and their hosts can produce toxic alkaloids, which can develop into airport bird repellent grass, thus reduce the occurrence of airport bird strike. Drunken horse grass (Achnatherum inebrians) carries Epichloë gansuensis and Epichloë inebrians, and the natural Drunken horse grass are always associated. In this study, by comparing the main bird repellent methods in domestic airports, it is proposed that the airfield bird repellent grass containing Epichloë endophyte can replace the existing airfield grass as a new bird repellent method.

To discover potent endophytes, we have isolated some of the fungi from medicinally important plant Caralluma acutangula. The isolated endophytes were assessed for extra-cellular enzymes [1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, cellulases, phosphatases and glucosidases)] and IAA production. The potent endophytes have been identified as Paecilomyces variotii, Penicilliunz purpurogenum and Epicoccum nigrum on the basis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region homology. The endophytic strains P. variotii and E. nigrurn have produced IAA, phosphatases and glucosidases in significantly higher amounts.

281,"Composition and Biodiversity of Culturable Endophytic Fungi in the Roots of Alpine Medicinal Plants in Xinjiang, China","(1) Background: Endophytic fungi play an important role in plant growth and stress resistance. The presence of a special fungal taxon such as the dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungi in alpine environments is particularly important for plant resistance to environmental stresses. However, the composition of root endophytic fungi in different environments and between different host plants has not been well studied. (2) Results: A total of 408 culturable endophytic fungi were isolated from the roots of Saussurea involucrata and Rhodiola crenulata which were collected in 5 plots from the Tianshan and Karakoram Mountains of the Xinjiang region, belonging to 91 species, 54 genera, 31 families, and 3 phyla based on the morphological characteristics and molecular sequence. Among them, DSE fungi were the dominant group, accounting for 52.94%, and Leptodontidium orchidicola was the dominant species. In addition, we also compared the composition and diversity of root endophytic fungi from different plants and different sites, with emphasis on special fungal taxa such as DSE. (3) Conclusions: The composition and diversity of cultural endophytic fungi are significantly different in the two alpine medicinal plant species and across various locations. Some fungi showed the preferences of the host or environment. The endophytic fungal resources, especially DSE, were very rich in the two alpine medicinal plants, indicating that these fungi may play a crucial role in the ecological adaptation of host plants in harsh environments.","Hou, MY; Zhu, J; Leng, CY; Huang, XJ; Yang, MS; Yin, YF; Xing, YM; Chen, J",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2025,10.3390/jof11020113,0.990610525868733,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999145542492993,8.544575070067e-4,0.999999926990536,7.30094638079493e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

1493,"Molecular divergence of fungal communities in soil, roots and hyphae highlight the importance of sampling strategies","Molecular ecology studies of fungi in roots and soils involve sampling DNA from heterogeneous environments. There is a wide range of fungal life strategies, including modes of sporulation, and interactions some fungi may have with roots of different plant species. Therefore, assessment of the relative abundance of fungi in these complex environments needs to take into account fungal life cycles, including sporulation, as well as potential interactions with roots, whether they are specific or non-specific. Such heterogeneity means that a significant factor in quantification of fungi from environmental samples based on DNA sequences is the sampling strategy employed. Therefore, we investigated fungal communities associated with soil, roots, and hyphae extracted from soil in a relatively homogeneous agricultural soil in which Pennisetum clandestinum (Whittet Kikuyu) was grown as a monoculture in a glasshouse experiment with the naturally occurring fungal community. Pennisetum clandestinum occurs in pasture monocultures in south-western Australia and this model was used to minimise potential variability in fungal occurrence associated with multiple plant species. The community structures of the fungi overall, and that of the subset of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, were assessed using ITS rRNA sequencing. For fungi overall, there were marked differences in the relative abundance of the dominant phyla Chytridiomycota and Zygomycota in soil, roots, and hyphae from soil. For AM fungi (Glomeromycota), there was greater diversity within soil and among hyphae from soil than in roots, with marked differences in relative abundance of two orders, Archeosporales and Diversisporales. Roots were dominated by Glomus spp. Dark septate endophyte hyphae were dominant in roots but not in soil according to DNA sequencing, although they were not dominant in roots based on microscopy. Sporulation could influence fungal dominance in fungal DNA analyses, and this may be the case for the dark septate hyphae observed here. The considerable diversity in fungal communities based on DNA sequences from the relatively homogeneous environmental samples investigated in our study highlights the need for appropriate sampling and interpretation based on fungal life strategies, especially in more heterogeneous environmental samples of roots and soil under field conditions. There is potential for multiple DNA copies of fungal sequences associated with spores either inside roots or in soil, in addition to heterogeneity associated with growth of fungal hyphae in roots and in the rhizosphere of different plant species.","Mickan, BS; Hart, MM; Solaiman, ZM; Jenkins, S; Siddique, KHM; Abbott, LK",RHIZOSPHERE,2017,10.1016/j.rhisph.2017.09.003,0.735545759979316,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99618713063408,0.00381286936592035,0.99999999995779,4.2210346329341096e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
499,Endophytic Fungi Occurring in Ipomoea carnea Tissues and their Antimicrobial Potentials,"The aim of this work was to study the endophytic fungi associated with the tissues of Ipomoea carnea, a common invasive plant of India.

Species of Curvularia, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Colletotrichum and sterile fungus were isolated as dominant endophytes. Colonization frequency of Curvularia (7.25%) was highest which was isolated from all the tissues. The samples collected during the monsoon harbored more endophytes and showed higher species richness than the samples obtained in summer season. Of the total isolates, 15 isolates (21.74%) displayed antimicrobial activity, inhibiting at least one of the test microorganisms that comprised of pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Shigella dysentriae) and fungi (Trichophyton rubrum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton sp).

18241,Effects of grazing different ergovaline concentrations on vasoactivity of bovine lateral saphenous vein.,"Previous research has demonstrated that exposure to ergot alkaloids reduces vasoactivity of serotonin (5HT) receptors. Chemical suppression of tall fescue seedhead production is a tool to reduce the level of exposure to ergot alkaloids by a grazing animal. Therefore, the objective was to evaluate contractility of lateral saphenous veins biopsied from mixed breed steers following a 87- to 101-d grazing period on 3-ha pastures of bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon; n = 5 steers; BW = 340 ± 9 kg), or toxic endophyte-infected tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) that was not treated (n = 5 steers; BW = 300 ± 6; 0.56 ppm ergovaline) or was treated (n = 5 steers; BW = 294 ± 9 kg; 0.24 ppm ergovaline) with herbicide containing aminopyralid and metsulfuron-methyl. To evaluate contractility, biopsied veins were mounted in a multimyograph and exposed to increasing concentrations of a tall fescue seed extract (EXT; ergovaline source) and 5HT1B (CP 93129), 5HT1D (L-694,247), and 5HT2A (TCB2) agonists. All contractility data were normalized to a maximal response of 1 × 10-4 M norepinephrine and were analyzed as a split plot treatment design using SAS for effects of pasture treatment, agonist concentration, and the interaction. There was no contractile response to any concentration of 5HT1B agonist in any of the pasture treatments. There were pasture × concentration interactions for contractile responses to 5HT2A agonist (P < 0.01) and EXT (P < 0.01). For both EXT and TCB2, veins from bermudagrass steers were more vasoactive to the higher concentrations of these compounds (P < 0.05), and there were no differences between veins collected from the unsuppressed or seedhead-suppressed treatments (P = 0.66). There was also a pasture × concentration interaction for the contractile responses to 5HT1D agonist (P < 0.01). However, these responses were not sigmoidal and reached a zenith at 5 × 10-7 and 1 × 10-6 M. At these concentrations, the response was greatest for veins from the unsuppressed treatment (P < 0.05) and did not differ between veins from suppressed and bermudagrass treatments (P = 0.41). Although reduced levels of ergovaline in seedhead-suppressed pastures did not alter vasoactivity of 5HT2A or 5HT1B receptors in the lateral saphenous vein, elevated vasoactivity of 5HT1D in veins from unsuppressed tall fescue pasture treatment suggests that lower ergovaline levels in seedhead-suppressed pastures can influence the vascular effects of ergot alkaloids.",Klotz JL; Aiken GE; Egert-McLean AM; Schrick FN; Chattopadhyay N; Harmon DL,Journal of animal science,2018,10.1093/jas/sky163,0.966319426306336,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.983939545117888,0.0160604548821124,0.999999256409094,7.43590905960545e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5245,"Relocation, high-latitude warming and host genetic identity shape the foliar fungal microbiome of poplars","Micro-organisms associated with plants and animals affect host fitness, shape community structure and influence ecosystem properties. Climate change is expected to influence microbial communities, but their reactions are not well understood. Host-associated micro-organisms are influenced by the climate reactions of their hosts, which may undergo range shifts due to climatic niche tracking, or may be actively relocated to mitigate the effects of climate change. We used a common-garden experiment and rDNA metabarcoding to examine the effect of host relocation and high-latitude warming on the complex fungal endophytic microbiome associated with leaves of an ecologically dominant boreal forest tree (Populus balsamifera L.). We also considered the potential effects of poplar genetic identity in defining the reactions of the microbiome to the treatments. The relocation of hosts to the north increased the diversity of the microbiome and influenced its structure, with results indicating enemy release from plausible pathogens. High-latitude warming decreased microbiome diversity in comparison with natural northern conditions. The warming also caused structural changes, which made the fungal communities distinct in comparison with both low-latitude and high-latitude natural communities, and increased the abundance of plausible pathogens. The reactions of the microbiome to relocation and warming were strongly dependent on host genetic identity. This suggests that climate change effects on host-microbiome systems may be mediated by the interaction of environmental factors and the population genetic processes of the hosts.","Bálint, M; Bartha, L; O'Hara, RB; Olson, MS; Otte, J; Pfenninger, M; Robertson, AL; Tiffin, P; Schmitt, I",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2015,10.1111/mec.13018,0.84441538156931,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.974682862184408,0.0253171378155917,0.999991870581196,8.12941880434792e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

15439,Development and Evaluation of Biocontrol Agents Against Panax ginseng Root Rot,"Objective： To develop safe and effective microbial agents against Panax ginseng root rot. Method： P. notoginseng endophytes were screened in plate confrontation tests，followed by morphological and molecular biological identification of antagonistic strains，optimization of strain fermentation conditions in a single factor test，and determination of optimal carriers and auxiliary agents of the microbial agent and their ratio using response surface methodology for formulating the production process. The prevention and control effects of the microbial agent were verified in the confrontation and pot culture experiments. Result： The plate confrontation test yielded a strain named Fusarium pseudoanthophilum with significant resistance to root rot， and its antibacterial rate was 53.33%. According to the single factor test，the fermentation conditions of F. pseudoanthophilum were determined to be fermentation time 60 h，fermentation temperature 26 ℃，speed 120 r· min-1，and pH 6.5. The response surface optimization results showed that the number of viable bacteria reached the maximum（5.23×109 cfu·g-1）when the peat was 60.00 g，sodium carboxymethylcellulose 3.50 g，and sodium alginate 4.76 g. The influences of carriers and auxiliary agents on the number of viable bacteria were sorted by degree in a descending order as follows：peat>sodium carboxymethylcellulose >sodium alginate. The confrontation test results showed that when the microbial agent concentration was greater than 1.00 g·L-1，it had a significant inhibitory effect on the root rot pathogen F. oxysporum and the inhibitory rate was more than 42.3%. As demonstrated by the pot culture experiment，the inoculation of biocontrol agent for 28 d significantly reduced the incidence（66.99%）of root rot in P. ginseng seedlings and disease index（61.69%）and increased their leaf length（33.04%）and fresh weight（34.48%）.

GTDs are responsible for considerable loss of quality, production, and vineyard longevity. Seventy-five percent of Chilean vineyards are estimated to be affected by GTDs. GTDs are complex diseases caused by several fungi species, including members of the Botryosphaeriaceae family and Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, considered some of the most important causal agents for these diseases in Chile. In this study, we isolated 169 endophytic and 209 rhizospheric fungi from grapevines grown under organic and conventional farming in Chile. Multiple isolates of Chaetomium sp., Cladosporium sp., Clonostachys rosea, Epicoccum nigrum, Purpureocillium lilacinum, and Trichoderma sp. were evaluated for their potential of biocontrol activity against Diplodia seriata, Neofusicoccum parvum, and Pa. chlamydospora. Tests of antagonism were carried out using two dual-culture-plate methods with multiple media types, including agar containing grapevine wood extract to simulate in planta nutrient conditions. Significant pathogen growth inhibition was observed by all isolates tested. Clonostachys rosea showed 98.2% inhibition of all pathogens in the presence of grapevine wood extract. We observed 100% pathogen growth inhibition when autoclaved lignified grapevine shoots were pre-inoculated with either C. rosea strains or Trichoderma sp.

15905,Effect of floristic composition and configuration on plant root mycobiota: a landscape transposition at a small scale,"Fungal communities in the root endosphere are heterogeneous at fine scale. The passenger hypothesis assumes that this heterogeneity is driven by host plant distribution. Plant composition and host plant configuration should then influence root fungal assemblages. We used a large-scale experimental design of 25 mixtures of grassland plants. We sampled Brachypodium pinnatum in each mesocosm, and used amplicon mass-sequencing to analyze the endospheric mycobiota. We used plant distribution maps to assess plant species richness and evenness (heterogeneity of composition), and patch size and the degree of isolation of B. pinnatum (heterogeneity of configuration) on fungal community assembly. The Glomeromycotina community in B. pinnatum roots was not related to either floristic heterogeneity or productivity. For Ascomycota, the composition of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was driven by plant evenness while OTU richness decreased with plant richness. For Basidiomycota, richness increased with host plant aggregation and connectivity. Plant productivity influenced Ascomycota, inducing a shift in OTU composition and decreasing evenness. Plant heterogeneity modified root mycobiota, with potential direct (i.e. host preference) and indirect (i.e. adaptations to abiotic conditions driven by plant occurrence over time) effects.

On leaf surfaces, hyphal elongation and spore germination of cucumber powdery mildew, Podosphaera xanthii, were inhibited, but B. bassiana strain GHA, the active ingredient isolated from Botanigard, only inhibited hyphal elongation but had no effect on spore germination of P. xanthii. In addition, strain GHA suppressed powdery mildew symptoms locally, not systemically. Treatment with Botanigard and strain GHA induced a hypersensitive response (HR)-like cell death in epidermal cells of the cucumber leaves in a concentration dependent manner and inhibited penetration by P. xanthii. Transcriptome analysis and mass spectrometry revealed that GHA induced expression of salicylic acid (SA)-related genes, and treatment with Botanigard and GHA increased the SA level in the cucumber leaves. In NahG-transgenic tomato plants, which do not accumulate SA, the biocontrol effect of tomato powdery mildew by GHA was significantly reduced. These results suggested that B. bassiana GHA induces SA accumulation, leading to the induction of HR-like cell death against powdery mildew and subsequent suppression of fungal penetration. Thus, Botanigard has the potential to control both insect pests and plant diseases.","Iida, Y; Higashi, Y; Nishi, O; Kouda, M; Maeda, K; Yoshida, K; Asano, S; Kawakami, T; Nakajima, K; Kuroda, K; Tanaka, C; Sasaki, A; Kamiya, K; Yamagishi, N; Fujinaga, M; Terami, F; Yamanaka, S; Kubota, M",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2023,10.3389/fpls.2023.1211825,0.816243636882691,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999517712917027,4.8228708297319e-4,0.999999595323362,4.0467663775523e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
7402,Biodegradation of the phytoestrogen luteolin by the endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambari,"Phytoestrogens are plant-derived hormonally-active compounds known to cause varied reproductive, immunosuppressive and behavioral effects in vertebrates. In this study, biodegradation of luteolin, a common phytoestrogen, was investigated during incubation with endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambari. The optimum concentration of luteolin as sole carbon source supplied in culture was 200 mg L-1, which allowed 97 and 99 % degradation of luteolin by P. liquidambari in liquid culture and soil conditions, respectively. The investigation of the fungal metabolic pathway showed that luteolin was first decomposed to caffeic acid and phloroglucinol. These intermediate products were degraded to protocatechuic acid and hydroxyquinol, respectively, and then rings were opened by ring-cleavage dioxygenases. Two novel genes encoding the protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase and hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase were successfully cloned. Reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that expression levels of mRNA of these two genes increased significantly after P. liquidambari was induced by the intermediate products caffeic acid and phloroglucinol, respectively. These results revealed that P. liquidambari can biodegrade luteolin efficiently and could potentially be used to bioremediate phytoestrogen contamination.","Wang, HW; Zhang, W; Su, CL; Zhu, H; Dai, CC",BIODEGRADATION,2015,10.1007/s10532-015-9727-4,0.892499653036099,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.750458091918942,0.249541908081058,0.999965991063748,3.40089362524942e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
11256,Isolation and functional characteristics of the fungus Hypoxylon spp. Sj18 with biocontrol potential,"A fungus with biocontrol potential was isolated from the roots of hickory trees. The strain named sj18 was classified as a member of the genus Hypoxylon (Hypoxylaceae) after multigene phylogenetic analysis (beta-tubulin gene, internal transcribed spacer, 28S large subunit ribosomal RNA gene, and RNA polymerase II subunit gene). The strain grew well on a PDA with an optimum temperature range between 32 and 34 degrees C. The fungus had obvious inhibitory effects on Botryosphaeria dothidea, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, and Gibberella moniliformis in fumigation experiments on solid agar plates. In an inoculation experiment of Chinese cabbage, the fungus was also found to have an obvious repellent effect on cabbage caterpillars. In vitro experiments on Petri dishes showed that the fermentation broth of the sj18 strain could kill 100% of Bursaphelenchus xylophilus within 8 h even if the fermentation broth was diluted 8 times. The inoculation test of Arabidopsis thaliana showed that the fungus could promote the lateral root formation of plants and significantly increase their aboveground biomass. Through the analysis of solid phase microextraction (SPME), it was found that the main volatile components of the fermentation products were azulene 65.39% (61.77% thorn 3.62%), caryophyllene 7.41%, and eucalyptol 6.83% according to the peak area ratio. Therefore, sj18 can be used as a candidate for the further research and development of biocontrol agents.","Jin, QY; Peng, HZ; Zhu, TJ; Ye, HL",FUNGAL BIOLOGY,2022,10.1016/j.funbio.2021.12.001,0.970391022596435,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.887242255639623,0.112757744360377,0.999998202813284,1.79718671644569e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
19683,Antifungal Secondary Metabolites Produced by the Fungal Endophytes: Chemical Diversity and Potential Use in the Development of Biopesticides.,"Plant diseases caused by phytopathogenic fungi can lead to huge losses in the agricultural fields and therefore remain a continuous threat to the global food security. Chemical-based fungicides contributed significantly in securing crop production. However, indiscriminate application of fungicides has led to increased chemical resistance and potential risks to human health and environment. Thus, there is an urgent need for searching for new bioactive natural products and developing them into new biopesticides. Fungal endophytes, microorganisms that reside in the fresh tissues of living plants, are regarded as untapped sources of novel natural products for exploitation in agriculture and/or medicine. Chemical examination of endophytic fungi has yielded enormous antifungal natural products with potential use in the development of biopesticides. This review summarizes a total of 132 antifungal metabolites isolated from fungal endophytes in the past two decades. The emphasis is on the unique chemical diversity of these metabolic products, together with their relevant antifungal properties.

21183,Chemotherapeutic agents: Taxol and vincristine isolated from endophytic fungi,"Endophytic fungi are abundant and have been found asymptomatically in most plants species. Endophytic fungi are considered as hidden members of the microbial world and represent an under-utilized resource of natural bioactive compounds for agricultural, industrial and medicinal uses. As reported previously, several valuable natural products with anticancer, antimicrobial, and insecticidal properties have been successfully extracted from the endophytic fungi. Chemotherapy yields the first promise of destroying cancer cells that has distributed into the body. This is due to the fact that chemotherapeutic agents overlap with the process of dividing cancer cells, which in turn leads to establishing new cells.

A tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) sod heavily infected with the Acremonium coenophialum endophyte was plowed, and pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum Leeke) or crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.) was grown. Pearl millet produced more shoot dry matter and was more heavily colonized than crabgrass, and soil populations of mycorrhizal fungi were usually higher with pearl millet. Associated with the production of pearl millet and crabgrass were radical changes in the mycorrhizal fungal community. Populations of eight of 19 species decreased, four of them not detected at the end of the season. Populations of nine increased, five of them not detected at the beginning of the season. Field host and time affected species richness, dominance, and diversity; but only time affected equitability. This study suggests that crop rotation may be used to manage the mycorrhizal fungal community. Managing these fungi may be important if individual species or biotypes are found to be pathogenic or mutualistic.","GUO, BZ; AN, ZQ; HENDRIX, JW; DOUGHERTY, CT",SOIL SCIENCE,1993,10.1097/00010694-199306000-00005,0.989785399999009,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999437157276273,5.6284272372657e-4,0.999999999644915,3.55084850411913e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1735,Mutualisms in a changing world: an evolutionary perspective,"There is growing concern that rapid environmental degradation threatens mutualistic interactions. Because mutualisms can bind species to a common fate, mutualism breakdown has the potential to expand and accelerate effects of global change on biodiversity loss and ecosystem disruption. The current focus on the ecological dynamics of mutualism under global change has skirted fundamental evolutionary issues. Here, we develop an evolutionary perspective on mutualism breakdown to complement the ecological perspective, by focusing on three processes: (1) shifts from mutualism to antagonism, (2) switches to novel partners and (3) mutualism abandonment. We then identify the evolutionary factors that may make particular classes of mutualisms especially susceptible or resistant to breakdown and discuss how communities harbouring mutualisms may be affected by these evolutionary responses. We propose a template for evolutionary research on mutualism resilience and identify conservation approaches that may help conserve targeted mutualisms in the face of environmental change.","Kiers, ET; Palmer, TM; Ives, AR; Bruno, JF; Bronstein, JL",ECOLOGY LETTERS,2010,10.1111/j.1461-0248.2010.01538.x,0.946153147210226,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.398086877238066,0.601913122761934,0.999841403591339,1.58596408661e-4,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

5915,The evolutionary origins of Epichloe endophytes from annual ryegrasses,"The annual Lolium (ryegrass) species were surveyed for seedborne, asexual Epichloe: endophytes (i.e., Neotyphodium spp.). Endophytes that were extremely slow growing in culture were identified from all seven annual ryegrass spp. Sequences of beta -tubulin gene (tu62) introns and the internal transcribed spacers of the nuclear ribosomal RNA (rDNA-ITS) were determined, as were profiles based on five microsatellite loci. Two taxonomic groups of annual ryegrass endophytes were distinguishable by morphology, culturability and genotypes. One group, for which the name Neotyphodium occultans is proposed, comprised only isolates that could not be subcultured on potato dextrose agar medium. These isolates contained multiple tub2 genes and multiple alleles at microsatellite loci, suggestive of an interspecific hybrid origin. The results of phylogenetic analysis implied that the ancestors of N, occultans included Epichloe; baconii and E. bromicola, or close relatives. The second taxonomic group of annual ryegrass endophytes, exemplified by isolate Lc4, was found only in L. canariense. This taxon had a single tub2 sequence and microsatellite genotype that was nearly identical to those of extant Epichloe typhina isolates that infect Poa nemoralis. Therefore, it is proposed that Lc4 is an asexual derivative of an E. typhina genotype closely related to extant strains from P. nemoralis. We propose the name Neotyphodium typhinum var. canariense for this taxon. These two new endophyte taxa from the annual ryegrasses are further examples of asexual Neotyphodium species that have arisen from sexual Epichloe; spp. either directly by loss of the sexual state, or by interspecific hybridization events.","Moon, CD; Scott, B; Schardl, CL; Christensen, MJ",MYCOLOGIA,2000,10.2307/3761478,0.785804291197639,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999867383579052,1.3261642094796e-4,0.999999987020994,1.29790060920953e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

3601,The Bacterial and Fungal Microbiota of the Mexican Rubiaceae Family Medicinal Plant Bouvardia ternifolia,"Bouvardia ternifolia is a medicinal plant considered a source of therapeutic compounds, like the antitumoral cyclohexapeptide bouvardin. It is known that large number of secondary metabolites produced by plants results from the interaction of the host and adjacent or embedded microorganisms. Using high-throughput DNA sequencing of V3-16S and V5-18S ribosomal gene libraries, we characterized the endophytic, endophytic + epiphyte bacterial, and fungal communities associated to flowers, leaves, stems, and roots, as well as the rhizosphere. The Proteobacteria (average 80.7%) and Actinobacteria (average 14.7%) were the most abundant bacterial phyla, while Leotiomycetes (average 54.8%) and Dothideomycetes (average 27.4%) were the most abundant fungal classes. Differential abundance for the bacterial endophyte group showed a predominance of Erwinia, Propionibacterium, and Microbacterium genera, while Sclerotinia, Coccomyces, and Calycina genera predominated for fungi. The predictive metagenome analysis for bacteria showed significative abundance of pathways for secondary metabolite production, while a FUNguild analysis revealed the presence of pathotroph, symbiotroph, and saprotrophs in the fungal community. Intra and inter copresence and mutual exclusion interactions were identified for bacterial and fungal kingdoms in the endophyte communities.

8209,Metabolomics-based chemotaxonomy of root endophytic fungi for natural products discovery,"Fungi are prolific producers of natural products routinely screened for biotechnological applications, and those living endophytically within plants attract particular attention because of their purported chemical diversity. However, the harnessing of their biosynthetic potential is hampered by a large and often cryptic phylogenetic and ecological diversity, coupled with a lack of large-scale natural products' dereplication studies. To guide efforts to discover new chemistries among root-endophytic fungi, we analyzed the natural products produced by 822 strains using an untargeted UPLC-ESI-MS/MS-based approach and linked the patterns of chemical features to fungal lineages. We detected 17809 compounds of which 7951 were classified in 1992 molecular families, whereas the remaining were considered unique chemistries. Our approach allowed to annotate 1191 compounds with different degrees of accuracy, many of which had known fungal origins. Approximately 61% of the compounds were specific of a fungal order, and differences were observed across lineages in the diversity and characteristics of their chemistries. Chemical profiles also showed variable chemosystematic values across lineages, ranging from relative homogeneity to high heterogeneity among related fungi.

3756,Exploring potential bacterial and fungal biocontrol agents transmitted from seeds to sprouts of wheat,"Seed-borne endophytes could be transmitted vertically from generation to generation. This vertical transmission should select against pathogenicity and favour mutualism as these endophytes depend entirely on their host for survival and reproduction. To elucidate the vertically transmitted core bacteriome and mycobiome throughout the germination process of wheat seeds, the bacterial and fungal taxa of sprouts, sprouts from sterilized seeds and seeds of healthy wheat plants were analyzed by Illumina-based sequencing. Results suggested that the sprouts from sterilized seeds contained more diverse fungi than those in the seeds and sprouts, nevertheless, the seeds contained more diverse bacteria than those in sprout samples. The wheat seeds and sprouts contained different dominant bacterial and fungal taxa. Bacterial OTUs belong to Erwinia and Rhizobiales were founded in seed and all sprout samples, but the abundance of Erwinia decreased in sprouts. The dominant fungal genus Emericella was detected in seed and all sprout samples. The results suggested that wheat seeds and sprouts might contain core bacteriome and mycobiome during the development from seeds to sprouts and could transmit in the plant tissues of wheat. The core endophytes should illustrate more intimate correlation with host plants than other microbial taxa and the results are helpful for elucidating the plant-microbe interactions and selecting suitable microbial biocontrol agents for wheat production.

The esterase EST-01 was unique to isolate 33 and can, therefore, be used as a marker for this isolate. None of the esterases identified were common to all isolates tested. Similarly, phylogenetic analysis, based on rDNA sequence data, classified the isolates into 5 genus groups: 1) Curvularia with a 100% bootstrap value (BP), 2) Alternaria with 100% BP, 3) Epicoccum with 60% BP, 4) Phoma with 89% BP, and 5) Saccharicola with 100% BP. This polyphyletic analysis based on several markers, therefore, proved to be a valuable approach in determining the relationship between variation in endophytes and their associated host plants. Furthermore, both the esterase and rDNA analyses obtained similar results and were equally effective in resolving relationships.","Leme, AC; Bevilaqua, MRR; Rhoden, SA; Mangolin, CA; Machado, MFPS; Pamphile, JA",GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH,2013,10.4238/2013.September.27.11,0.593667472933649,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999905089204291,9.49107957093521e-5,0.999966844329883,3.31556701174129e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

16138,Bioactive sorbicillinoid derivatives from an endophytic fungus Trichoderma citrinoviride,"Three new sorbicillinoid derivatives, citrinsorbicillinol A-C (1–3), along with three known compounds, such as trichosorbicillin G (4), dibutyl phthalate (5), and 3-(4-methoxyphenyl) propanoic acid (6), were isolated from the endophyte Trichoderma citrinoviride of Coptis chinensis. Their structures were elucidated through extensive analyses of spectroscopic data, computer-assisted structure elucidation (ACD/Structure Elucidator), density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, and electronic circular dichroism (ECD). Biologically, compounds 1–4 exhibited potential antioxidant activity, as assessed using the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, with IC50 values ranging from 27.8 to 89.6 μM. In particular, compounds 2 and 3 demonstrated radical scavenging activity comparable to that of the positive control, ascorbic acid, with IC50 values of 27.8 and 31.2 μM, respectively. Moreover, compound 1 exhibited potential anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 macrophages, with an IC50 value of 52.7 μM. These findings underscore the therapeutic potential of the new sorbicillinoid derivatives for antioxidant and anti-inflammatory applications.

5306,Salinity Alleviation and Reduction in Oxidative Stress by Endophytic and Rhizospheric Microbes in Two Rice Cultivars,"Increased soil salinity poses serious limitations in crop yield and quality; thus, an attempt was made to explore microbial agents to mitigate the ill effects of salinity in rice. The hypothesis was mapping of microbial induction of stress tolerance in rice. Since the rhizosphere and endosphere are two different functional niches directly affected by salinity, it could be very crucial to evaluate them for salinity alleviation. In this experiment, endophytic and rhizospheric microbes were tested for differences in salinity stress alleviation traits in two rice cultivars, CO51 and PB1. Two endophytic bacteria, Bacillus haynesii 2P2 and Bacillus safensis BTL5, were tested with two rhizospheric bacteria, Brevibacterium frigoritolerans W19 and Pseudomonas fluorescens 1001, under elevated salinity (200 mM NaCl) along with Trichoderma viride as an inoculated check. The pot study indicated towards the presence of variable salinity mitigation mechanisms among these strains. Improvement in the photosynthetic machinery was also recorded. These inoculants were evaluated for the induction of antioxidant enzymes viz. CAT, SOD, PO, PPO, APX, and PAL activity along with the effect on proline levels. Modulation of the expression of salt stress responsive genes OsPIP1, MnSOD1, cAPXa, CATa, SERF, and DHN was assessed. Root architecture parameters viz. cumulative length of total root, projection area, average diameter, surface area, root volume, fractal dimension, number of tips, and forks were studied. Confocal scanning laser microscopy indicated accumulation of Na+ in leaves using cell impermeant Sodium Green (TM), Tetra (Tetramethylammonium) Salt. It was found that each of these parameters were induced differentially by endophytic bacteria, rhizospheric bacteria, and fungus, indicating different paths to complement one ultimate plant function. The biomass accumulation and number of effective tillers were highest in T4 (Bacillus haynesii 2P2) plants in both cultivars and showed the possibility of cultivar specific consortium. These strains and their mechanisms could form the basis for further evaluating microbial strains for climate-resilient agriculture.","Gupta, A; Singh, AN; Tiwari, RK; Sahu, PK; Yadav, J; Srivastava, AK; Kumar, S",PLANTS-BASEL,2023,10.3390/plants12050976,0.995770132813167,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98064928920253,0.0193507107974702,0.999999742172555,2.57827444727354e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Groups of Trees,"Root-associated fungal communities are important components in ecosystem processes, impacting plant growth and vigor by influencing the quality, direction, and flow of nutrients and water between plants and fungi. Linkages of plant phenological characteristics with belowground root-associated fungal communities have rarely been investigated, and thus our aim was to search for an interplay between contrasting phenology of host ectomycorrhizal trees from the same location and root-associated fungal communities (ectomycorrhizal, endophytic, saprotrophic and pathogenic root-associated fungi) in young and in adult silver fir trees. The study was performed in a managed silver fir forest site. Twenty-four soil samples collected under two phenologically contrasting silver fir groups were analyzed for differences in root-associated fungal communities using Illumina sequencing of a total root-associated fungal community. Significant differences in beta diversity and in mean alpha diversity were confirmed for overall community of ectomycorrhizal root-associated fungi, whereas for ecologically different non-ectomycorrhizal root-associated fungal communities the differences were significant only for beta diversity and not for mean alpha diversity. At genus level root-associated fungal communities differed significantly between early and late flushing young and adult silver fir trees. We discuss the interactions through which the phenology of host plants either drives or is driven by the root-associated fungal communities in conditions of a sustainably co-naturally managed silver fir forest.","Unuk, T; Martinovic, T; Finzgar, D; Sibanc, N; Grebenc, T; Kraigher, H",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2019,10.3389/fpls.2019.00214,0.861469427957408,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999715526519544,2.8447348045645e-4,0.999999990171115,9.82888459510889e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10654,"Study of sodium 3-hydroxycoumarin as inhibitors in vitro, in vivo and in silico of Moniliophthora perniciosa fungus","The inhibition of the fungus Moniliophthora perniciosa, which is the causal agent of witches' broom disease in Theobroma cacao L., is the main focus of the present study. The use of phytoalexins has provided disease control that is as efficient as control with the use of fungicides, with the advantage of not harming humans and the environment. In this sense, the objective was to evaluate the action of 3-hydroxycoumarin compared with the standard defence activator acibenzolar-Smethyl (Bion (R) 500 WG) and systemic fungicide tebuconazole (Folicur (R) 200 CE), and study the possible mechanisms of action. Initially, basidiospore germination inhibition assays (in vitro) were performed using four different concentrations of 3-hydroxycoumarin. The result was 100% inhibition at the concentration of 1000 ppm. Thereafter, this substance was used in four different treatments (in vivo) of cacao seedlings of the SIC-23 genotype, with regard to the order of application. The data analysis showed greater inhibition when 3-hydroxycoumarin was applied after inoculation (TAI test), and suggested a curative effect on Theobroma cacao seedlings. In silico, it was used the enzyme chitin synthase because this action as key enzyme in chitin biosynthetic pathway. The in silico tests show that 3hydroxycoumarin inhibited the production of chitin synthase by the fungus. Therefore, the present study identifies a potential inhibitor of M. perniciosa and suggests the best application methodology.","Gonçalves, PD; dos Santos, MC; Sousa, CD; Góes-Neto, A; Luz, EDMN; Damaceno, VO; Niella, ARR; Barbosa, JM; de Assis, SA",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY,2019,10.1007/s10658-018-1536-2,0.834388209065056,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.890153834335656,0.109846165664344,0.999998826507559,1.17349244099785e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
17678,Bioaugmentation with copper tolerant endophyte Pseudomonas lurida strain EOO26 for improved plant growth and copper phytoremediation by Helianthus annuus.,"Organic fertilizers became a better alternative to chemical fertilizers in modern agricultural practices however, contamination of copper (Cu) from organic fertilizer is still a major concern for the globe. Plant growth promoting (PGP) microorganisms showed their efficiency to combat with this problem and thus Cu tolerant PGP endophytes from roots of Odontarrhena obovata (Alyssum obovatum) growing on Cu smelter contaminated serpentine soil were explored in present study. Out of twenty-four isolates, Pseudomonas lurida strain EOO26 identified by 16s rRNA gene sequencing was selected to check its efficacy for Cu-remediation. The strain EOO26 showed multi-metal tolerance, drought resistance and exhibited PGP attributes such as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase, siderophore and ammonia production. Significant production of indole-3-acetic acid and phosphate-solubilization under different Cu concentration (0-100 mg L-1) at varying pH (5.0-8.0) suggests potentiality of this strain to work effectively under wide range of abiotic stress conditions. Plant growth experiment (pH 6.8 ± 0.3) in copper spiked soil suggested a significant increase in length and dry weight of root and shoot of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) after inoculation with strain EOO26. Plants inoculated with strain EOO26 resulted in increase in Cu uptake by 8.6-fold for roots and 1.9-fold for leaves than uninoculated plants. The total plant uptake in inoculated Cu treatment was 2.6-fold higher than uninoculated one, which is much higher than the previously reported Cu accumulating plants. The excellent adaptation abilities and promising metal removal efficiency strongly indicate superiority of strain EOO26 for phytoremediation of Cu-contamination and may work effectively for Cu removal from contaminated soils.",Kumar A; Tripti NA; Voropaeva O; Maleva M; Panikovskaya K; Borisova G; Rajkumar M; Bruno LB,Chemosphere,2021,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2020.128983,0.966977102423517,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.924945903257658,0.0750540967423419,0.999986097124509,1.39028754911896e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
4870,Increased abundance of secreted hydrolytic enzymes and secondary metabolite gene clusters define the genomes of latent plant pathogens in the Botryosphaeriaceae,"BackgroundThe Botryosphaeriaceae are important plant pathogens, but also have the ability to establish asymptomatic infections that persist for extended periods in a latent state. In this study, we used comparative genome analyses to shed light on the genetic basis of the interactions of these fungi with their plant hosts. For this purpose, we characterised secreted hydrolytic enzymes, secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters and general trends in genomic architecture using all available Botryosphaeriaceae genomes, and selected Dothideomycetes genomes.ResultsThe Botryosphaeriaceae genomes were rich in carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), proteases, lipases and secondary metabolic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) compared to other Dothideomycete genomes. The genomes of Botryosphaeria, Macrophomina, Lasiodiplodia and Neofusicoccum, in particular, had gene expansions of the major constituents of the secretome, notably CAZymes involved in plant cell wall degradation. The Botryosphaeriaceae genomes were shown to have moderate to high GC contents and most had low levels of repetitive DNA. The genomes were not compartmentalized based on gene and repeat densities, but genes of secreted enzymes were slightly more abundant in gene-sparse regions.ConclusionThe abundance of secreted hydrolytic enzymes and secondary metabolite BGCs in the genomes of Botryosphaeria, Macrophomina, Lasiodiplodia, and Neofusicoccum were similar to those in necrotrophic plant pathogens and some endophytes of woody plants. The results provide a foundation for comparative genomic analyses and hypotheses to explore the mechanisms underlying Botryosphaeriaceae host-plant interactions.","Nagel, JH; Wingfield, MJ; Slippers, B",BMC GENOMICS,2021,10.1186/s12864-021-07902-w,0.93398169564375,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999726149171045,2.738508289547e-4,0.999998791442875,1.20855712504309e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2338,"Genome mining of a fungal endophyte of Taxus yunnanensis (Chinese yew) leads to the discovery of a novel azaphilone polyketide, lijiquinone","Genome mining of Ascomycete sp. F53 (F53), a fungal endophyte of the traditional Chinese medicinal plant Taxus yunnanensis (Chinese yew), revealed 35 putative specialized metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters, one of which encodes a rarely seen tandem polyketide synthase pathway with close homology to azaphilone biosynthesis pathways. A novel compound, lijiquinone 1, was subsequently isolated from F53 and structurally and functionally characterized. The m/z 385 [M + H+](+) compound, comprised of a cyclohexenone side group attached to a core bicyclic ring, displayed cytotoxicity against human myeloma cells (IC50 = 129 mu M), as well as antifungal activity against Candida albicans (IC50 = 79 mu M) and Cryptococcus albidus (IC50 = 141 mu M). Our results suggest that enzymes encoded on the lij gene cluster are responsible for the synthesis of 1 and that the medicinal properties of T. yunnanensis could be partially mediated by this novel azaphilone.

18077,Ergot alkaloid exposure during gestation alters: II. Uterine and umbilical artery vasoactivity1.,"Previous research has shown that livestock exposed to ergot alkaloids results in decreased vasoactivity of gastrointestinal and peripheral vasculature. Little is known regarding the effect ergot alkaloid exposure during gestation may have on vasculature supporting the fetus. The objective of this study was to evaluate contractile responses of uterine and umbilical arteries collected from ewes consuming ergot alkaloids during gestation. On day 35 of gestation, 36 Suffolk ewes (78.24 ± 9.5 kg) were assigned to endophyte-infected (E+) or endophyte-free (E-) tall fescue seed treatments that were fed either throughout or switched on day 86 of gestation, creating four seed treatments E+E+, E+E-, E-E+, and E-E-. Ewes were fed E+ tall fescue seed to provide 1.77 mg of total ergovaline ⋅ hd-1 ⋅ d-1 with E- ewes receiving the same quantity of E- seed. Gestation was terminated on day 133, and sections of uterine artery and umbilical cord were surgically collected. Only collections from 28 ewes (n = 7/treatment) were of sufficient viability to proceed with the contractility experiments. Arteries were cleaned, sliced into 2-mm cross sections, and suspended in multi-myograph chambers containing 5 mL of continuously oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer. Vessels were exposed to increasing concentrations (5 × 10-8 to 1 × 10-4 M) of norepinephrine, serotonin, ergotamine, and ergovaline (5 × 10-9 to 1 × 10-5M; extract of tall fescue seed) in 15-min intervals. Increasing concentrations of norepinephrine generated a contractile response by the uterine artery (P < 0.05), but no response in the umbilical artery. Increasing concentrations of serotonin resulted in negligible responses in uterine preparations, whereas umbilical artery preparations were responsive (P < 0.05) to serotonin. Ewes receiving E+E+ and E-E+ treatments had decreased vasoactivity in umbilical arteries to serotonin with a dextral shift in concentrations where the response curve initiated (P < 0.05). Interestingly, uterine arteries were not responsive to exposure to ergotamine or ergovaline, whereas umbilical arteries were responsive (P < 0.05). Umbilical arteries collected from ewes receiving E-E- and E+E- were more vasoactive to ergot alkaloids (P < 0.05) than other treatments. These findings indicate that maternal blood supply to the placenta appears protected from negative effects of ergot alkaloids; however, umbilical vasculature is not, and this could adversely influence fetal growth.",Klotz JL; Britt JL; Miller MF; Snider MA; Aiken GE; Long NM; Pratt SL; Andrae JG; Duckett SK,Journal of animal science,2019,10.1093/jas/skz069,0.994156354803444,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.319601631517581,0.680398368482419,0.998912650554734,0.00108734944526556,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

It is one of the genera with more endophytes (which cause no damage to the host plants). This review highlights the capability of Fusarium species to degrade environmental pollutants and describes the biodegradation pathways of some of the emerging environmental contaminants. Some Fusarium species use metabolic strategies enabling them to efficiently mineralize high concentrations of toxic environmental pollutants. These fungi can degrade hydrocarbons, pesticides, herbicides, dyes, pharmaceutical compounds, explosives, plastics, and plastic additives, among other pollutants, and possess high metal biosorption capabilities. According to data from consulted reports, Fusarium strains showed a percentage of biodegradation of a variety of contaminants ranging between 30 % and 100 % for different tested concentrations (from 1 mg to 10 g/L) in a time range between 10 h and 90 d. Enzymes such as esterase, cutinase, laccase, lignin peroxidase, manganese peroxidase, dehydrogenase, lipase, dioxygenase, and phosphoesterase were detected during the pollutant biodegradation process.

In this review, we summarized the current trend of knowledge on the different groups of microbial species inhabiting G. biloba including novel microbial species recently identified. Moreover, novel secondary metabolites isolated from these endophytes and their associated biological activities are also discussed. Our investigation is indicating clearly that G. biloba is a very rich source of endophytes because more than 30 genera of fungi and bacteria have already been reported as endophytes of this plant. However, because only a very small fraction of isolated endophytes was fully characterized, this diversity is highly underestimated, besides the paucity of information regarding endophytic bacteria and actinomycetes. We also brought to light the fact that limited is data regarding the bioactive spectrum of these endophytes.

13197,Selection of infective arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal isolates for field inoculation,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play a key role in host plant growth and health, nutrient and water uptake, plant community diversity and dynamics. AM fungi differ in their symbiotic performance, which is the result of the interaction of two fungal characters, infectivity and efficiency. Infectivity is the ability of a fungal isolate to establish rapidly an extensive mycorrhizal symbiosis and is correlated with pre-symbiotic steps of fungal life cycle, such as spore germination and hyphal growth. Here, different AM fungal isolates were tested with the aim of selecting infective endophytes for field inoculation. Greenhouse and microcosm experiments were performed in order to assess the ability of 12 AM fungal isolates to produce spores, colonize host roots and to perform initial steps of symbiosis establishment, such as spore germination and hyphal growth. AM fungal spore production and root colonization were significantly different among AM fungal isolates. Spore and sporocarp densities ranged from 0.8 to 7.4 and from 0.6 to 2.0 per gram of soil, respectively, whereas root colonization ranged from 2.9 to 72.2%. Percentage of spore or sporocarp germination ranged from 5.8 to 53.3% and hyphal length from 4.7 to 79.8 mm. The ordination analysis (Redundancy Analysis, RDA) showed that AM fungal isolates (used as explanatory variables) explained about 60% of the whole variance and their effect on fungal infectivity variables was significant (P = 0.002). The biplot clearly showed that variables which might be used to detect infective AM fungal isolates were hyphal length and root colonization.

Methods: A Markov decision tree was used to compare the following strategies at the time of HIV diagnosis: no intervention, one time systematic serum cryptococcal antigen (CRAG) screening and treatment of positive patients, and systematic primary prophylaxis with fluconazole. The trajectory of a hypothetical cohort of HIV-infected patients with CD4+ count <= 100 cells/mu l initiating care was simulated over a 1-year period (cotrimoxazole initiation at enrollment; antiretroviral therapy within 3 months). Natural history and cost data (US$ 2009) were from Cambodia. Efficacy data were from international literature. Results: In a population in which 81% of patients had a CD4+ count <= 50 cells/mu l and 19% a CD4+ count between 51-100 cells/mu l, the proportion alive 1 year after enrolment was 61% (cost $ 472) with no intervention, 70% (cost $ 483) with screening, and 72% (cost $ 492) with prophylaxis. After one year of follow-up, the cost-effectiveness of screening vs. no intervention was US$ 180/life year gained (LYG). The cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis vs. screening was $ 511/LYG. The cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis vs. screening was estimated at $1538/LYG if the proportion of patients with CD4+ count <= 50 cells/mu l decreased by 75%. Conclusion: In a high endemic area of cryptococcosis and HIV infection, serum CRAG screening and prophylaxis are two cost effective strategies to prevent AIDS associated cryptococcosis in patients with CD4+ count <= 100 cells/mu l, at a short-term horizon, screening being more cost-effective but less effective than prophylaxis. Systematic primary prophylaxis may be preferred in patients with CD4+ below 50 cells/mu l while systematic serum CRAG screening for early targeted treatment may be preferred in patients with CD4+ between 51-100 cells/mu l.","Micol, R; Tajahmady, A; Lortholary, O; Balkan, S; Quillet, C; Dousset, JP; Chanroeun, H; Madec, Y; Fontanet, A; Yazdanpanah, Y",PLOS ONE,2010,10.1371/journal.pone.0013856,0.975846876615883,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.9997986682906,2.0133170939993e-4,0.999999999997221,2.7793323198466197e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11100,Serendipita Species Trigger Cultivar-Specific Responses to Fusarium Wilt in Tomato,"The endophytic fungi Serendipita indica and S. vermifera have recently gained increasing attention due to their beneficial effects on plant growth and plant health. Little is known about other species, such as S. williamsii and S. herbamans. To test their biocontrol and growth-promoting potential, susceptible and tolerant tomato cultivars (Kremser Perle and Micro-Tom, respectively) were inoculated with S. williamsii, S. herbamans, S. indica, or S. vermifera and challenged with the soilborne pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol) in greenhouse experiments. Furthermore, in vitro assays on the direct inhibitory effects of Serendipita spp. against Fol were performed. Negative effects of Fol on phenological growth in the susceptible cultivar were alleviated by all four applied Serendipita spp. Apart from these similar effects on biometric parameters, disease incidence was only reduced by S. herbamans and S. vermifera. In the tolerant cultivar, disease parameters remained unaffected although shoot dry mass was negatively affected by S. vermifera. Direct effects of Serendipita spp. against Fol were not evident in the in vitro assays indicating an indirect effect via the host plant. Our results highlight the importance of identifying cultivar-specific effects in pathogen-endophyte-plant interactions to determine the most beneficial combinations.","Sefloo, NG; Wieczorek, K; Steinkellner, S; Hage-Ahmed, K",AGRONOMY-BASEL,2019,10.3390/agronomy9100595,0.95046255880621,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.97244804087339,0.0275519591266101,0.999999985031152,1.49688482720123e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10406,Influence of fungal infection on plant tissues: FTIR detects compositional changes to plant cell walls,"Compositional change in plant cell walls as a result of infection by non-host (putative) endophytes and a host pathogen were studied by quantifying plant cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) produced by these fungi, and by detecting cell wall changes via Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and relative lignin/carbohydrate intensity ratios. Oil palm ramets were first inoculated with homogenized fungal suspension. The treated fungal suspensions were assayed for CWDEs whereas the ramets were powderized for FTIR analysis. Results revealed that putative endophytes and host pathogen expressed all CWDEs, suggesting their probable roles in infection and colonization. Following inoculation, plant cell wall composition showed missing dips in spectra depicting changes to carbohydrate, xylan and lignin constituents. The indistinguishable FTIR spectra for putative endophyte-inoculated and pathogen-inoculated ramets suggest that both endophytes and pathogen have elicited similar responses to plant cell walls. Relative lignin/carbohydrate ratios further demonstrated that the putative endophytes did not breakdown lignin and carbohydrate, further exemplifying the non-pathogenic and asymptomatic infection by the endophytes. This study presents the influence of putative endophytes on plant tissues of oil palm, and how this compared to pathogenic infection. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society.

9751,Superior bio-efficacy of a combined formulation of carbendazim and mancozeb in inducing defense responses in chilli seedlings against Sclerotium rolfsii Sacc. in comparison with methyl jasmonate,"The objective of this work was to investigate the efficacy of a prepackaged combined formulation, Companion (carbendazim 12% + mancozeb 63% WP), sole application of carbendazim 50% WP manozeb 75% WP and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), an inducer of systemic acquired resistance on disease severity and their role in post-infectional defense responses in chilli seedlings against Sclerotium rolfsii. Seeds were treated for 8 h with MeJA (2.5 mM and 5.0 mM) and each of fungicides (500 ppm), and were sown in pots containing soil and fungal inocula (95:5 w/w). At 15 days after sowing maximum defense against fungal infection was exhibited by Companion comparably followed by the sole application of carbendazim and mancozeb. MeJA reduced percent mortality of S. rolfsii-infected chilli seedlings significantly as compared to the inoculated control. Assessment of peroxidase (POX) and esterase (EST) at 15 days after sowing revealed the increased activity under inoculated condition. Highest POX activity in MeJA treatments (5 mM > 2.5 mM) was followed by the Companion treatment. Highest EST activity was registered in Companion treatment. The zymogram of POX isozymes showed over-expression of POX 2 and POX 4 isoforms, and induction of POX I isoform in inoculated treatments. On the other hand, that of EST isozymes showed induction of EST I isoform in Companion, carbendazim and MeJA treatments. All EST isoforms were over-expressed in Companion-treated seedlings. Both fungicides and MeJA showed significant effects on disease severity, induction of defense enzymes and isozyme pattern in S. rolfsii-infected chilli seedlings. Contact and systemic fungicides under the experiment demonstrated differential responses. The combination formulation was superior in disease control to application of the fungicide components individually. They compared favourably with MeJA in induction of defense-related enzyme activities. All these findings are new with respect to the chilli-S. rolfsii host-pathogen interaction system, S. rolfsii representing the sclerotial basidiomycetes in particular. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As a result, metal-induced phytotoxicity concerns require quick and urgent action to retain and maintain the physiological activities of microorganisms, the nitrogen pool of soils, and the continuous yields of wheat in a constantly worsening environment. The current study was conducted to evaluate the plant growth-promoting endophytic Aspergillus flavus AUMC 16,068 and its EPS for improvement of plant growth, phytoremediation capacity, and physiological consequences on wheat plants (Triticum aestivum) under lead stress. After 60 days of planting, the heading stage of wheat plants, data on growth metrics, physiological properties, minerals content, and lead content in wheat root, shoot, and grains were recorded. Results evoked that lead pollution reduced wheat plants' physiological traits as well as growth at all lead stress concentrations; however, inoculation with lead tolerant endophytic A. flavus AUMC 16,068 and its respective EPS alleviated the detrimental impact of lead on the plants and promoted the growth and physiological characteristics of wheat in lead-contaminated conditions and also lowering oxidative stress through decreasing (CAT, POD, and MDA), in contrast to plants growing in the un-inoculated lead polluted dealings.

14490,First report of Cadophora luteo-olivacea causing side rot on ‘conference’ pears in the Netherlands,"Pear (Pyrus communis) is an important fruit crop in the Netherlands. Symptoms of side rot disease of pear fruits were first observed in 2008 on cv. Conference in storage in the Netherlands. Typical round to oval, dark-brown, and slightly sunken spots (size 0.5 to 1.0 cm in diameter) appeared after six or more months of cold storage under controlled atmosphere. Lesions of rinsed pears were sprayed with 70% ethanol and tissue under the lesion was placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 20°C in the dark. Colonies obtained from single spores produced on PDA were flat, felty and cottony in the middle, with smooth margins, an even edge, and varying in color from white turning to gray/black-olivaceous. Under UV light, ellipsoid or elongate conidia were produced (2.2 to 2.3 × 4.9 to 6.5 µm). Both cultural and morphological characteristics of the pathogen were similar to those described for Cadophora sp. (Spadaro et al. 2011). Three representative isolates (PPO 11-1228, PPO 24-1234, and PPO 107-1267) were sequenced using primers ITS1/ITS4 and EF1-728F and EF1-986R (Carbone and Kohn 1999). MegaBLAST analysis revealed that the ITS sequences (GenBank accession nos. KT350591, KT350592, and KT350593) matched with 99.8 to 100% identity to Cadophora luteo-olivacea in GenBank (KU141394 and KU141395). The TEF1 sequences (KT350597, KT350598, and KT350599) were 100% identical with many other culture collection C. luteo-olivacea sequences in GenBank (HQ661071 and KF764576) and only 71 to 80% to other Cadophora species isolated from pear (KT350601 and KT350602). Alcohol surface sterilized fruits were inoculated in pathogenicity tests in two ways: i) with an agar disk (10 mm diameter) with actively growing mycelium of C. luteo-olivacea prepared from a 14-day-old culture grown on PDA (isolates PPO 11-1228, PPO 24-1234, and PPO 107-1267); and ii) with 20 µl of a spore suspension (105 conidia ml–1) prepared from a 21-day-old PDA culture after wounding with a needle (isolates PPO 11-1228 and PPO 107-1267). Both experiments were performed at 5 and 15°C, on 10 ‘Conference’ pears per isolate-temperature combination. Inoculated fruits were sealed in plastic bags and were incubated in darkness. Typical symptoms appeared 7 to 14 days and 4 to 6 weeks later, for fruits incubated at 15 and 5°C, respectively. Mock-inoculated controls with water and PDA-only controls remained symptomless. Fungi isolated from the lesions had morphological characteristics that resembled the original isolates from infected pears. The identity of the reisolations was confirmed as C. luteo-olivacea by sequencing, thus completing Koch’s postulates. Side rot of long-term stored pears has first been reported in Oregon, United States (Bertrand et al. 1977). The primary causal fungus was identified as C. malorum (syn. Phialophora malorum) (Sugar and Spotts 1992). Recently, a skin pitting disease of kiwifruit caused by C. luteo-olivacea has been reported from Italy (Spadaro et al. 2010).

Their structures were determined by extensive spectroscopic analyses including 1D and 2D NMR, HRMS, ECD spectra, UV, and IR, as well as single-crystal X-ray diffraction, and shown to be azaphilones sharing a 3,6a-dimethy1-9-(2-methylbutanoyl)-9H-furo[2,3-h]isochromene-6,8-dione scaffold. Owing to the remarkable antibacterial potency of known azaphilones coupled to the usage of the host plant in TCM, we evaluated the antibacterial efficacy of the isolated compounds against two commonly dispersed environmental strains of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, as well as against two human pathogenic clinical strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Compound 1 exhibited marked antibacterial potencies against the environmental strains that were comparable to the standard antibiotics. Compound 3 was also active against E. coli.

16870,"Brenneria salicis, the bacterium causing watermark disease in willow, resides as an endophyte in wood.","Brenneria salicis has been studied in willow wood only in relation to watermark disease. In this pathogenic condition, the bacterium occurs at high concentrations. Pathogenicity of B. salicis is still uncontrollable and the disease unpredictable because the plant-bacteria interaction is not understood. Thanks to molecular techniques B. salicis can be detected at low concentrations, which are found in most non-pathogenic interactions. Brenneria salicis was identified and traced with a new specific three-primer polymerase chain reaction and its identity and relative concentration in biological samples confirmed through denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiling. Brenneria salicis was found in symptomless willows sampled randomly in Flanders agricultural areas, in young nursery willows, and also in poplar (Populus) and alder (Alnus). It harboured the nitrogenase reductase gene NifH and promoted growth and chlorophyll in willow. Inoculated luminescence-marked B. salicis circulated through the whole plant without inducing disease and exuded at the leaf margins. Other willow endophytes identified were Rahnella, Sphingomonas and Methylobacterium.

2135,Olfactory responses of Argentine stem weevil to herbivory and endophyte-colonisation in perennial ryegrass,"Argentine stem weevil adults (ASW, Listronotus bonariensis) feed on the leaves of agricultural grasses and their larvae mine the pseudostem, causing extensive damage that can result in plant death. Plants emit volatiles that serve as signals to host-searching insects and these odours can be altered by both herbivory and fungal endophyte-infection. This study investigated whether ASW adults utilise olfaction to identify their host plants, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), and if conspecific herbivory or the presence of Epichloe festucae var. lolii fungal endophytes (strain wild-type or AR1) influenced such responses. Results from olfactometer bioassays established that ASW adults were able to utilise their olfactory response to orient towards volatiles released by perennial ryegrass and further, the weevils displayed a preference for plants previously damaged by conspecific weevils. However, there was no evidence that weevils had the ability to distinguish between endophyte-infected and endophyte-free plants using olfaction alone. Using a push-pull extraction technique, thirteen volatile compounds were identified in the blend released by perennial ryegrass. Endophyte and herbivory were found to alter these volatile compounds and quantities emitted by this forage grass. This study suggests that despite observing differences in the plant volatile blend, ASW do not perceive endophyte (wild-type and AR1) using olfaction alone and must rely on other cues, e.g. contact chemoreception or post-ingestional malaise, to detect the presence of a bioactive endophyte in an otherwise acceptable host plant.","Hennessy, LM; Popay, AJ; Glare, TR; Finch, SC; Cave, VM; Rostás, M",JOURNAL OF PEST SCIENCE,2022,10.1007/s10340-021-01375-2,0.908636059539249,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999845169527061,1.5483047293868e-4,0.999996802397355,3.19760264533286e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
555,ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI COMMUNITY IN Eremarrthus erythropappus TREE FROM ANTHROPOGENIC AND NATURAL AREAS OF MINAS GERAIS,"It is know that many plants live in symbiosis with microorganisms that can be found on their interior, the endophytes. Environment and tissue type are modulating factors of this community, in which most of these microorganisms produce important antimicrobial molecules and they may be powerful biocontrol agents in agriculture. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the community of Endophytic fungi from Eremanthus erythropappus in anthropogenic and natural areas (with human interaction, natural habitat and planned planting) of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, through cultivation-based approach and verify their antimicrobial activity against phytopathogenic fungal and pathogenic bacteria. The endophytic fungi isolated were identified by sequencing of the ITS region and subjected an in vitro antagonism test. The antagonisms that show antibiosis were submitted to tests on split plates to verify the volatile compound production. In the pairing testes, the endophytic fungi of the genera Cryptosporiopsis, Diaporthe, Xylaria, Paraconiothyrium and Camarosporium presented antibiosis against phytopathogenic fungi by releasing compounds in the medium. To our knowledge, this paper is the first report on the isolation of twelve genera fungi in E erythropappus besides verifying their antagonist capacity, which opens the way for discovery of bioactive substances produced by endophytic fungi that inhibit pathogens.","Godinho, BTV; Santos, IAFM; Gomes, EA; Piccoli, RH; Cardoso, PG",CERNE,2019,10.1590/01047760201925032642,0.897378088899992,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999999999999601,3.9863940310388e-13,0.999999999997769,2.2311041902867097e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2222,"Co-occurring patterns of endophyte infection and genetic structure in the alpine grass, Festuca eskia: implications for seed sourcing in ecological restoration","Choosing the provenance of seed used in ecological restoration could entail its success. An alternative approach to examine local adaptation in seed sourcing is the assessment of genetic structure and diversity based on molecular markers. These types of analyses focus on the genetics of the target plant itself and eliminate the genetic influence of associated organisms, such as EpichloA <</Neotyphodium endophytes in grasses. By impacting the fitness of their host, such symbionts may influence population genetic structure and diversity. Therefore, seed sourcing for grasses must consider the influence of their endophytes to increase seed translocation success and minimize the risks associated with this practice. To delineate seed zones for restoration of the alpine fescue Festuca eskia Ramond ex. DC. (Poaceae), we assessed population genetic differentiation and diversity patterns in the species including endophyte occurrence along altitudinal and longitudinal gradients in the Pyrenees Mountains. Twenty-three populations were analysed for endophyte status, and three STS and one SSR marker were used to examine genetic differentiation and diversity patterns. Results showed that F. eskia hosts an asexual form of EpichloA << and infection frequency within populations decreased from East to West (100 vs. 8-25%). Molecular markers separated F. eskia into two East and West groups, and endophyte infection and genetic patterns were congruent with molecular data. Little evidence for genetic differentiation or difference in endophyte occurrence associated with altitude was detected. Little variation was found in within population diversity, regardless of provenance altitude and site, and/or endophyte infection frequency. The results of this study suggested the establishment of two distinct management units for F. eskia seed sourcing restoration.","Gonzalo-Turpin, H; Barre, P; Gibert, A; Grisard, A; West, CP; Hazard, L",CONSERVATION GENETICS,2010,10.1007/s10592-009-9927-8,0.945676974863045,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999784008813232,2.1599118676822e-4,0.999999999999465,5.34794430961938e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

18650,Endophytic bacterium V4 from albino tea plant enhances umami taste as well as flowery and roasted aromas in dried tea.,"The application of microbial fertilizers in tea cultivation has emerged a promising strategy to enhance tea quality and promote sustainable agricultural practices. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, the impacts of endophytic bacteria V4 on tea fresh leaves and dried tea were investigated. The results demonstrated that astringency in V4 sample was significantly reduced, while the umami and sweetness tastes, along with flowery and roasted aromas were significantly enhanced compared to the SW sample. Analysis of key quality-related compounds revealed a significant decrease in tea polyphenols and catechins, accompanied by a marked increase in free amino acids and soluble sugars. Evaluation of aroma characteristic impact (ACI) values of key volatile compounds revealed that β-ionone, 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine, 2-ethyl-3,6-dimethylpyrazine and 2,3-diethyl-5-methylpyrazine in V4 sample were significantly higher than those in SW sample. Transcriptomic analysis indicated downregulation of key catechin biosynthesis genes (such as CsLAR, CsANS and CsSCPL) in tea leaves treated with V4, while theanine biosynthetic genes such as CsAlaDC and CsTS were upregulated.

17378,First Report of Powdery Mildew Caused by Erysiphe cruciferarum on Garden Cress in Korea.,"Garden cress (Lepidium sativum L.), belonging to the family Brassicaceae, is an edible herb with peppery flavor and aroma (2). This plant was recently introduced and is cultivated as an edible green under organic farming in Korea. In September 2012, seedlings showing typical symptoms of powdery mildew were found in greenhouses in Pyeongchang County, Korea. Symptoms first appeared as thin white colonies, which progressed to abundant growth on the leaves and stems. Infected herbs were unmarketable mainly due to signs of senescence and withering of leaves and mostly abandoned without becoming harvested. Two samples of diseased leaves were deposited in the Korea University Herbarium (KUS Accession Nos. F27137 and F27150). Appressoria on the mycelium were well-developed, lobed, and solitary or in opposite pairs. Conidiophores were unbranched, cylindrical, 88 to 120 × 8.5 to 10 μm, and composed of 3 to 4 cells. Foot-cells of conidiophores were straight to sub-straight, cylindric, 22 to 42 μm long, and generally equal to or shorter than the upper cells. Singly produced conidia were oblong to cylindrical or oval, 34 to 52 × 14 to 18 μm with a length/width ratio of 2.2 to 3.3, with angular/rectangular wrinkling of outer walls, and no distinct fibrosin bodies. Germ tubes were produced on the perihilar position of conidia. No chasmothecia were found. These structures are typical of the powdery mildew Pseudoidium anamorph of the genus Erysiphe. The specific measurements match with those of E. cruciferarum Opiz ex L. Junell as previously described (1). To confirm the identification, the complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA from KUS-F27150 was amplified with primers ITS5 and P3 and directly sequenced (4). The resulting 554-bp sequence was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. KC414675). The amplified ITS sequence shared >99% similarity with the sequences of E. cruciferarum on several brassicaceous hosts (EU140958, FJ548627, and GU721075). Pathogenicity was confirmed through inoculation by gently dusting conidia onto leaves of five healthy potted garden cress plants. Five non-inoculated plants served as controls. Inoculated plants were isolated from non-inoculated plants in separate rooms in a greenhouse at 18 to 24°C. Inoculated plants developed signs and symptoms after 8 days, whereas the control plants remained symptomless. The fungus present on the inoculated plants was morphologically identical to that originally observed on diseased plants, fulfilling Koch's postulates. Previously, the disease was reported in several European countries and southeastern Asia (Lebanon, Israel, Iran, Iraq, India, and China) (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of powdery mildew caused by E. cruciferarum on garden cress in Korea. Since garden cress production was only recently started on a commercial scale in Korea, powdery mildew infections pose a serious threat to the production of this herb, especially in organic farming where chemical control options are limited.

16397,Co-Occurrence Patterns of Soil Fungal and Bacterial Communities in Subtropical Forest-Transforming Areas,"Soil microbial communities are engineers of important biogeochemical processes and play a critical role in regulating the functions and stability of forest ecosystem. However, few studies have assessed microbial interactions during forest conversion, which is essential to the understanding of the structure and function of soil microbiome. Herein, we investigated the co-occurrence network pattern and putative functions of fungal and bacterial communities in forest-transforming areas (five sites that cover the typical forests) using high-throughput sequencing of the ITS genes and 16S rRNA. Our study showed that the bacterial network had higher average connectivity and more links than fungal network, which might indicate that the bacterial community had more complex internal interactions compared with fungal one. Alphaproteobacteria_unclassfied, Telmatobacter, 0319-6A21 and Latescibacteria_unclassfied were the keystone taxa in bacterial network. For the fungal community network, the keystone taxon was Ceratobasidium. A structural equation model indicated that the available potassium and total organic carbon were important soil environmental factors, which affected all microbial modules, including bacterial and fungi. Total nitrogen had significant effects on the bacterial module that contains a relatively rich group of nitrogen cycling functions, and pH influenced the bacterial module which have higher potential functions of carbon cycling. And, more fungal modules were directly affected by forest structure (S Tree) compared with bacterial ones. This study provides new insights into our understanding of the feedback of underground creatures to forest conversion and highlights the importance of microbial modules in the nutrient cycling process. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Liu Y.; Jin X.; Huang S.; Liu Y.; Kong Z.; Wu L.; Ge G.,Current Microbiology,2024,10.1007/s00284-023-03608-2,0.89478830875529,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.928129415394265,0.0718705846057345,0.999999685963008,3.14036992299371e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

273,Unlocking antidiabetic potential: Novel compounds from endophytic fungi isolated from Manihot esculenta Crantz tuberous roots,"Penicillium oxalicum is an endophytic fungus isolated from cassava tuberous root (Manihot esculenta Crantz), and their ethyl acetate extract tested for free radicals scavenging and alpha-amylase, beta-glucosidase enzyme inhibitory assay. The profiling of molecules from endophytic fungal extract revealed thirteen volatile and four non-volatile bioactive molecules through GC-MS and LC-MS, respectively. Notably, four molecules 2-Phenylpyrido[3,4-d]1,3-oxazin-4-one (CID: 555,390)-9.40 kcal x mol-1, Guanosine (CID: 135,398,635)-7.60 kcal x mol-1, Quercetin-3-O-sophoroside (CID: 5282,166)-7.60 kcal x mol-1, and Esculin (CID: 5281,417)-7.20 kcal x mol-1 were identified for a better binding affinity against PPAR gamma protein. Molecular dynamics simulation studies predicted the Guanosine-PPAR gamma complex, which showed highly stable and better intermolecular interactions during the molecular dynamics simulation periods (500 ns). Further, the endophytic fungal extract showed excellent DPPH* and ABTS* scavenging and ferric ion-reducing potentials. Additionally, endophytic fungal extract displayed potential alpha-amylase and beta-glucosidase enzyme inhibitory activities compared to pioglitazone. These findings showed that the ethyl acetate fraction of P. oxalicum is an effective source of new antioxidants and possible diabetic inhibitory properties, which can be used to generate prospective antidiabetic drugs.","Nagarajan, K; Chelladurai, MD; Mani, S; Pavadai, P; Theivendren, P; Palanisamy, P; Sankaranarayanan, M; Kunjiappan, S",JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE,2025,10.1016/j.molstruc.2025.142083,0.973535734183989,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994651890510405,0.00534810948959448,0.999999457834315,5.4216568456944e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The experiment was carried out to isolate the associated seed-borne fungi in two wheat varieties and determine the efficacy of fungicides to control these seed-borne fungi of wheat. Wheat seed samples (Farmer's seed) of two (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties (BARI Gom-25 and BARI Gom-26) were collected from the Regional Agricultural Research Station, Jashore. The experiment was conducted following the complete randomized design (CRD) with four replications.

12384,Variability of the rhizospheric mycodiversity of the Algerian Pistacia atlantica Desf.,"Mycobionts make up most of the genetic diversity of underground life. Despite their abundance, their impact on terrestrial ecosystem processes is still poorly understood. Estimates suggest that 95% of plant species rely entirely on microbial symbiotes for growth and survival, underlining their importance in soil as a regulator of plant species richness and diversity. In this study, we explore an inventory of the fungal rhizobiome of two populations of Atlas pistachio in Laghouat (Algeria), a typical hot and arid region. Six healthy trees of different age classes were randomly sampled from each site during April 2016. In spite of the arid climate in our study area, microscopic identification revealed important fungal richness belonging to four phyla: Ascomycota, Glomeromycota and Basidiomycota with the exclusive presence of Mucoromycota in dayate Saadi. The fungal strains recorded indicate a high abundance of the Acaulospora sp. and Glomus sp. genera for the Glomeromycota phylum and Fusarium sp. genus for the other phyla. Shannon-Wiener diversity and evenness indices proved to be the highest at dayate Saadi. Dayate El Gouffa, however, is the least disturbed. Most of the strains recorded correspond to genera with a strong affinity for environments rich in organic matter, with high levels of total limestone, basic pH, and high levels of clay and fine silts as shown in the dayate Saadi soils. As for the dayate El Gouffa soils, they show a low organic matter content. They are less calcareous, with a very basic pH and predominance of coarse silts and coarse sands. The high rate of these granulometric fractions could explain the presence of Gigaspora sp. only in this daya. Our results indicated the strong impact of soils proprities on the rhizobiome community composition and might be explained by differences in the degree of fungi selectivity for each sampled site.","Mechiah, F; Boutelba, I; Smail-Saadoun, N",ACTA ECOLOGICA SINICA,2022,10.1016/j.chnaes.2021.08.003,0.73132094772518,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99967338785546,3.2661214454035e-4,0.999999997578868,2.42113162851609e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

A field experiment was conducted on Maury silt loam (fine, mixed, mesic, Typic Paleudults) soil from 1986 to 1988 to compare forage yields and quality of 'Kenhy'-EF, Kenhy-EI, and 'Johnstone' tall fescue with 'Ensilo' (diploid) and 'Reveille' (tetraploid) perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and 'Bison' ryegrass (Lolium intermediate). Each cultivar received 0, 75, or 150 kg ha-1 of N annually. At 150 kg ha-1 of N, Johnstone produced the highest 1987 to 1988 average dry matter (DM) yields of 6.7 Mg ha-1 compared with 5.7 Mg ha-1 for Kenhy-EI. Tall fescue generally produced higher yields than ryegrass. Ground cover after 3 yr for Reveille of 72% did not differ from Kenhy-EI (79%), but Ensilo (61%) and Bison (31%) were lower. Endophyte effects on yield and quality of Kenhy were seldom significant. Two-year weighted average in vitro dry matter disappearance (IVDMD) values were 685, 663, 626, 628, and 641 g kg-1 for Reveille, Ensilo, Kenhy-EF, Kenhy-EI, and Johnstone, respectively. Increasing N levels increased N concentration of tall fescue but did not consistently affect that of ryegrass. These results indicate that some cultivars of ryegrass can persist at this location, but that summer productivity is well below that of tall fescue. However, some potential may exist for germplasm improvement of perennial ryegrass based on existing cultivars. Endophyte effects on yield and quality of Kenhy tall fescue under the conditions of this study were small.","COLLINS, M",AGRONOMY JOURNAL,1991,10.2134/agronj1991.00021962008300030017x,0.910019550970319,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999876421135942,1.2357886405829e-4,0.999999993103395,6.8966051758323504e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

18782,From microbiome to biostimulants: unlocking the potential of tomato root endophytes.,"Microbe-based biostimulants offer a sustainable and promising alternative to synthetic inputs, potentially reducing or replacing conventional inputs in crop management. Studying the native microbiota, particularly endophytic microbes, helps in selecting those that are naturally adapted to persist and to enhance plant growth under specific environmental conditions. This study aims to define the endophytic microbiota adapted to tomato crops by selecting discriminant amplicon sequence variant (ASVs) that are enriched during key plant growth stages and found in the core microbiota. This study presents a large-scale analysis of tomato root endophytic prokaryotic microbiota using 16 S sequencing across the most common and widespread conditions used for tomato cultivation, offering comprehensive insight into its structure and dynamics. The results revealed a predominance of the Actinobacteriota and Proteobacteria phyla; less abundant groups included Bacteroidota, Verrucomicrobiota, Patescibacteria, and Firmicutes. Core microbiota analysis and discriminant ASV identification across different plant growth stages enabled the selection of the most abundant and persistent taxa adapted to the tomato endorhizosphere. Streptomyces, Shinella, Devosia, and Pseudoxanthomonas, as well as the lesser known genera Variovorax, Pseudarthrobacter, and Lechevalieria, represented the key genera identified, suggesting long-term host‒microbe associations. The description of the representative framework of the tomato-associated microbiota and the identification of its most important components provide a basis for developing tailored microbial formulations that can increase crop resilience and reduce dependence on synthetic agricultural inputs, aimed at developing more sustainable environmental management strategies.",Fagnano FM; Ventorino V; Pasolli E; Romano I; Ambrosino P; Pepe O,BMC plant biology,2025,10.1186/s12870-025-06447-4,0.841671480051072,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992434467026987,0.00756553297301282,0.999999980822586,1.91774136570899e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
13074,"Effect of Neotyphodium uncinatum endophyte on meadow fescue yielding, health status and ergovaline production in host-plants","The objective of our research was to assess the beneficial impact of the Neotyphodium uncinatum (Gams, Petrini and Schmidt) Glenn, Bacon and Hanlin endophyte on its natural host - meadow fescue. Assessment was made by measuring the green mass yield, the susceptibility of the host plants to infection by pathogens, and the content of the toxic alkaloid ergovaline, in field conditions. The research involved Justa meadow fescue. The studied factors were as follows: endophyte infection (E+ and E-) and system of use (for pasture and for cut). The effect of N. uncinatum on Justa meadow fescue yielding in all the combinations was observed. The presence of endophyte significantly enhanced higher yields of dry matter compared to the non-infested plants. The infestation of Justa meadow fescue by the endophyte, N. uncinatum, significantly protected the plants from infection of the fungi which causes leaf spot. The endophyte, however, did not affect the development of powdery mildew and rust fungi. Justa meadow fescue showed a relatively high content of ergovaline when grown in the field. The level of the toxin in the season varies a lot, which suggests a high effect of external factors on its production. Due to the production of the toxin, the animal feed made from infested plants can pose a threat to animals when administered over a long period. N. uncinatum isolates from Justa meadow fescue cannot be used as biological control agents to improve the growth and resistance of other cultivars, due to the production of ergovaline.",Pańka D.; Jeske M.; Troczyński M.,Journal of Plant Protection Research,2011,10.2478/v10045-011-0059-z,0.850867680158106,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997893070274229,0.00210692972577109,0.999999997386626,2.6133735175903902e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

16590,The effect of plant growth regulator treatments on the levels of ethylene emanating from excised turgid and wilted wheat leaves.,"Abscisic acid (ABA) inhibits the production of ethylene induced by water stress in excised wheat leaves and counteracts the stimulatory effect of 6-benzyladenine (BA) on this process. The stimulatory effect of BA and the inhibitory effect of ABA were equally pronounced whether external or endogenous ethylene levels were determined. When leaves were sprayed or floated on solutions of BA, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), gibberellic acid (GA3), or ABA, the relative activities of these growth regulators on stress-induced ethylene at 10(-4) mol l(-1) were BA>IAA >GA3>controls>ABA. In non-stressed leaves, however, where the levels of ethylene produced were 2-20 times smaller, the relative activities were IAA >BA>GA3>controls>ABA. The effects of BA and ABA spray treatment on water stress induced ethylene were closely similar whether the solutions were applied 2 or 18 h prior to the initiation of water stress. The relationships between the levels of endogenous growth regulators in the plant and ethylene release induced by water stress are discussed.",Wright ST,Planta,1980,10.1007/BF00388127,0.778040820121332,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.984792119871223,0.0152078801287771,0.999987813819451,1.21861805486567e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

16003,Peptidases production by Sordariomycetes sp fungus from Manihot esculenta Crantz waste: Application in gluten hydrolysis,"With the increasing incidence of problems related to gluten intolerance, many studies are being conducted to develop effective treatments and alternatives for gluten digestion. In this context, this study investigated peptidases produced by endophytic fungi isolated from cassava residues capable of hydrolyzing gluten. Twelve fungi were isolated, identified via DNA sequencing, and evaluated for their potential to produce peptidases with this potential. Sordariomycetes sp. (ST15) presented the highest specific peptidase activity to hydrolyze gluten, determined via fluorescence spectroscopy. Therefore, this fungus was selected to perform the optimization step of producing this peptidase. A composite rotational design with a central point (DCCR) was used to evaluate the influence of pH, temperature, and time on fermentation. The ideal conditions for producing the peptidase of interest were pH 5.2, 27 °C, and 11 days. According to the profile obtained via HPLC, the peptidase-enriched extract demonstrated significant gluten hydrolysis potential, efficiently breaking down gliadin and glutenin proteins within two hours of reaction. These findings highlight the potential of ST15 peptidase as a biocatalyst for gluten hydrolysis, offering a promising alternative for controlling gluten intolerance. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",Andrade Neto J.C.; Morandim-Giannetti A.D.A.; Tognato R.C.; Juliano M.A.; Carmona A.K.; Bersanetti P.A.,Enzyme and Microbial Technology,2025,10.1016/j.enzmictec.2025.110678,0.849255397545117,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.987165555944379,0.0128344440556208,0.999999992378931,7.62106899809822e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
20585,Root colonization by fungal endophytes in Trithrinax campestris (Arecaceae) from semiarid ecosystems from Central Argentine,"Root colonization by fungal endophytes in Trithrinax campestris (Arecaceae) from semiarid ecosystems from Central Argentine. In arid and semiarid ecosystems, roots frequently form symbiosis with fungi that provides access to nutrients and water. Knowledge regarding the study of fungal symbionts colonizing native palms roots is still scarce. We described, quantified and compared fungal colonization in roots of Trithrinax campestris from two environmental situations: population with weak-burning-signs and population with strong-burning-signs. T campestris was colonized by arbuscular-mycorrhizal-fungi (AMF) and dark-septate-endophytes (DSE). AMF colonization was an intermediate type between Arum and Pans. The AMF and DSE colonization and root hair production differed between populations. Our results suggest that in T campestris the relation between fungal-symbionts and root-hair-production might be related to tolerance to burning and aridity.","Lugo, MA; Giordano, PG; Urcelay, C; Crespo, EM",BOLETIN DE LA SOCIEDAD ARGENTINA DE BOTANICA,2011,NA,0.913478559280388,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.881903626781836,0.118096373218164,0.999999403799781,5.9620021863882e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
5205,Effects of continuous melon cropping on rhizospheric fungal communities,"Long-term continuous cropping of crops leads to soil degradation and a decrease in crop yield and quality. Continuous cropping obstacles are common with melon; however, the rhizosphere microbial community response to continuous cropping of melon remains poorly investigated. Here, we comparatively investigated the structure and function of the rhizospheric fungal community from melon greenhouses replanted for 0, 1, 2, and 3 years (CK, 1a, 2a, and 3a, respectively) using high-throughput absolute quantification sequencing. The results showed that the fungal abundance increased with continuous cropping duration, but the fungal diversity and richness decreased. The most dominant phyla were Ascomycota and Basidiomycota, and their absolute abundance increased continuously. At the genus level, Fusarium, Thanatephorus, and Plectosphaerella were the dominant genera, and their absolute abundance increased significantly (p < 0.05) with the continuous cropping duration. FUNGuild function prediction showed that continuous cropping caused the accumulation of endophyte-plant pathogens and plant pathogens, which may accelerate soil-borne diseases of melon. Our results provide guidance for revealing the mechanism of continuous cropping obstacles in melon, which is important in evaluating the sustainability of this agricultural practice.","Li, MY; Wang, JL; Zhou, Q; Yasen, M",RHIZOSPHERE,2023,10.1016/j.rhisph.2023.100726,0.951949464943038,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.95119003202279,0.0488099679772101,0.999997668778805,2.33122119519535e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11173,Biocontrol potential of endophytic Trichoderma harzianum AUMC 14897 against Fusarium seedling blight disease in oat,"BackgroundOat (Avena sativa L.) represents one of the important cereal crops grown in different areas around the world due to its use in human nutrition, food industry, biomaterials, and pharmaceutical industries. Fusarium seedling blight disease (FSBD) represents one of the most dangerous diseases affecting oat cultivation. Endophytic fungi proved to be useful in plant disease management. Therefore, the present study investigated the impact of applied endophytic Trichoderma harzianum AUMC 14897 culture filtrate (CF) on disease severity, plant performance, defense systems, antioxidant activity, and stress-related genes expression in oat plants infected with Fusarium oxysporum.ResultsThe dual culture assay results revealed that T. harzianum is antagonistic against F. oxysporum and could inhibit the growth by 86.6% seven days post inoculation. Scanning electron microscope results showed that the antagonism mechanisms include nutrition, space competition, and mycoparasitism. GC-MS analysis demonstrated the presence of several volatile organic compounds in T. harzianum CF and each component might contribute to its biological activity. In a greenhouse experiment, spraying and irrigation with T. harzianum CF revealed less severe symptoms and slower disease development in the infected oat plants compared to untreated plants. Moreover, T. harzianum CF treatment significantly enhanced the levels of total reducing power, phenolics, flavonoids, chlorophyll, carotenoids, antioxidant enzymes, and stress-related genes expression in F. oxysporum-infected oat plants.ConclusionsOur results demonstrated T. harzianum CF has an effective role in controlling FSBD in oat plants as a novel biocontrol agent.","El Zawawy, NA; El-Esawi, MA; Attia, N; Mahmoud, YAG",BMC PLANT BIOLOGY,2025,10.1186/s12870-025-06517-7,0.992244686005759,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.980807973073733,0.0191920269262673,0.999999999999717,2.83439938186802e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
9347,Contrasting Diversity and Host Association of Ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycetes versus Root-Associated Ascomycetes in a Dipterocarp Rainforest,"Root-associated fungi, including ectomycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi, are among the most diverse and important belowground plant symbionts in dipterocarp rainforests. Our study aimed to reveal the biodiversity, host association, and community structure of ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycota and root-associated Ascomycota (including root-endophytic Ascomycota) in a lowland dipterocarp rainforest in Southeast Asia. The host plant chloroplast ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit (rbcL) region and fungal internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) region were sequenced using tag-encoded, massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing to identify host plant and root-associated fungal taxa in root samples. In total, 1245 ascomycetous and 127 putative ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetous taxa were detected from 442 root samples. The putative ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycota were likely to be associated with closely related dipterocarp taxa to greater or lesser extents, whereas host association patterns of the root-associated Ascomycota were much less distinct. The community structure of the putative ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycota was possibly more influenced by host genetic distances than was that of the root-associated Ascomycota. This study also indicated that in dipterocarp rainforests, root-associated Ascomycota were characterized by high biodiversity and indistinct host association patterns, whereas ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycota showed less biodiversity and a strong host phylogenetic preference for dipterocarp trees. Our findings lead to the working hypothesis that root-associated Ascomycota, which might be mainly represented by root-endophytic fungi, have biodiversity hotspots in the tropics, whereas biodiversity of ectomycorrhizal Basidiomycota increases with host genetic diversity.","Sato, H; Tanabe, AS; Toju, H",PLOS ONE,2015,10.1371/journal.pone.0125550,0.614759302525961,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995232198629591,0.00476780137040862,0.999999982290291,1.77097085884981e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
6293,Accumulation of ajmalicine and vinblastine in cell cultures is enhanced by endophytic fungi of Catharanthus roseus cv. Icy Pink,"Catharanthus roseus belonging to the Apocynaceae family synthesizes indole alkaloids like vinblastine and ajmalicine which are used in cancer treatment and for decrease high blood pressure, respectively. However, these compounds with a high value added are accumulated at low level in the plants. For the first time, endophytic fungi isolated from leaves (Stemphylium amaranthi) and roots (Gliomastix masseei) of C. roseus cv. Icy Pink were used as fungal elicitors to improve the biomass of C. roseus callus culture as well as the accumulation of indole alkaloids in the calli. Polyphenols and the antioxidant activity of endophytes extracts were examined. The ethyl acetate extract of S. amaranthi showed the maximum scavenging activities in 1,1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2 '-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) assays. The maximum amount of total flavonoid and total phenol content were found in S. amaranthi (18.29 +/- 0.03 mg gallic acid equivalents.g(-1) and 0.117 +/- 0.00001 mg quercetin equivalents.g(-1), respectively). Also 5% cell extract and 5% culture filtrate extract of this endophytic fungus during 7 days of calli culture led to the highest contents of ajmalicine (0.735 mu g.g(-1) fresh weight) and vinblastine (0.059 mu g.g(-1) FW) respectively. Thus, endophytic fungi isolated from C. roseus could be used as fungal elicitor to improve the indole alkaloid production.","Hemmati, N; Azizi, M; Spina, R; Dupire, F; Arouei, H; Saeedi, M; Laurain-Mattar, D",INDUSTRIAL CROPS AND PRODUCTS,2020,10.1016/j.indcrop.2020.112776,0.969169230259144,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98729132063884,0.0127086793611599,0.999992112418363,7.8875816372781e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5885,Core endophyte communities of different citrus varieties from citrus growing regions in China,"The native microbiomes of citrus trees play important roles in plant health, with good communication between the native microbiome and the host plant. Here, we report on the native endophytes in 24 citrus varieties in nine citrus growing regions in China; some of the trees were healthy and others had asymptomatic or symptomatic huanglongbing, which is caused by the pathogen Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas). We used culture-dependent analysis and characterized the isolates by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The endophytes were compared between different citrus varieties, regions, and disease states (healthy, asymptomatic, and symptomatic). The total number of endophytes isolated from most of the citrus varieties was 10(4)-10(6) CFU/g of leaves, but it differed significantly by disease state, with the highest numbers in the healthy leaves and the lowest in the symptomatic leaves (p < 0.05). Among the citrus varieties, the Valencia variety had the maximum number of endophyte species (22). The most dominant endophytes were Bacillus subtilis, B. velezensis, Curtobacterium luteum, and Microbacterium testaceum. The higher frequency of B. subtilis in the healthy/asymptomatic plants compared to the symptomatic plants suggests that it has a role in huanglongbing resistance. Native endophyte communities in various citrus varieties could be used to improve citrus growth and combat CLas.","Munir, S; Li, YM; He, PF; Huang, M; He, PB; He, PJ; Cui, WY; Wu, YX; He, YQ",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2020,10.1038/s41598-020-60350-6,0.904728744078525,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999307115532573,6.9288446742686e-4,0.999999999997058,2.94209101525666e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

17407,Antioxidant treatments counteract the non-culturability of bacterial endophytes isolated from legume nodules.,"In many wild legumes, attempts to cultivate nodule bacteria fail. We hypothesized that the limited culturability could be related to injury from oxidative stress caused by disruption of plant tissues during isolation. To test that, we isolated bacteria from nodules of Hedysarum spinosissimum and Tetragonolobus purpureus using buffers supplemented with scavenging systems to prevent damage from reactive oxygen species (ROS). Treatments included the following: antioxidants (glutathione, ascorbate, EDTA) or enzymes (catalase, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase), tested either as modified squashing buffers or added in plates. Some combinations yielded dramatic increases of culturability. Different endophytes were found, including additional Rhizobiaceae that were not the primary symbiont and were unable to nodulate.

1719,Natural Occurrence of Entomopathogenic Fungi as Endophytes of Sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) and in Soil of Sugarcane Fields,"Simple Summary Sugarcane, an important cash crop in Malawi, is susceptible to numerous insect pests, and many farmers rely heavily on chemical insecticides for their control. Biopesticides containing insect pathogens are used in several countries outside Malawi; however, the occurrence and use of insect pathogens is limited in Malawi. In this study, we evaluated the natural occurrence of insect pathogenic fungi in sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) and in soil samples from sugarcane fields in Chikwawa District, southern Malawi. Insect pathogenic fungi from soil were isolated by baiting using larvae of the greater wax moth (Galleria mellonella). Insect pathogenic fungi were also isolated from surface-sterilized sugarcane leaves, stems, and roots. We found three types of insect pathogenic fungi: Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium spp., and Isaria spp. Beauveria bassiana and Isaria spp. were found mostly from sugarcane leaves and stems, while Metarhizium spp. was mainly found in soils. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of B. bassiana and Isaria spp. occurring naturally as endophytes in sugarcane. Further, it is the first report of B. bassiana, Isaria spp. and Metarhizium spp. in the soil of sugarcane fields in Africa. The natural occurrence of entomopathogenic fungal endophytes in sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) and in soil samples from sugarcane fields was evaluated in Chikwawa District, southern Malawi. Fungi from soil were isolated by baiting using Galleria mellonella larva. Fungal endophytes were isolated from surface-sterilized plant tissue sections. Forty-seven isolates resembled the genus Beauveria, 9 isolates were Metarhizium, and 20 isolates were Isaria. There was no significant difference in the number and type of fungal isolates collected from soil and from plant tissue. There was, however, a significant difference in the part of the plant where fungal species were isolated, which fungal species were isolated, and the number of fungal species isolated at each location. Phylogenetic analysis of 47 Beauveria isolates based on DNA sequencing of the Bloc intergenic region indicated that these isolates all belonged to B. bassiana and aligned with sequences of B. bassiana isolates of African and Neotropical origin. The Malawian B. bassiana isolates formed a distinct clade. No larvae died from infestation by multiple fungi. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of B. bassiana and Isaria spp. occurring naturally as endophytes in sugarcane.

19812,Distribution and antimicrobial potential of endophytic fungi associated with ethnomedicinal plant Melastoma malabathricum L.,"Distributions of endophytic fungi associated with ethnomedicinal plant Melastoma malabathricum L. was studied and 91 isolates belonging to 18 genera were recovered. The isolates were distributed to sordariomycetes (62.63%), dothideomycetes (19.78%), eurotiomycetes (7.69%), zygomycetes (4.19%), agaricomycetes (1.09%), and mycelia sterilia (4.39%). Based on colony morphology and examination of spores, the isolates were classified into 18 taxa, of which Colletotrichum, Phomopsis and Phoma were dominant, their relative frequencies were 23.07%, 17.58% and 12.08% respectively. The colonization rate of endophytic fungi was determined and found to be significantly higher in leaf segments (50.76%), followed by root (41.53%) and stem tissues (27.69%). All the isolates were screened for antimicrobial activity and revealed that 26.37% endophytic fungi were active against one or more pathogens. Twenty four isolates showing significant antimicrobial activity were identified by sequencing the ITS1-5.85-ITS2 region of rRNA gene. Results indicated that endophytic fungi associated with leaf were versatile as they showed antimicrobial activity against most of the tested pathogens. The endophytic fungi Diaporthe phaseolorum var. meridionalis (KF193982) inhibited all the tested bacterial pathogens, whereas, Penicillium chermesinum (KM405640) displayed most significant antifungal activity. This seems to be the first hand report to understand the distribution and antimicrobial ability of endophytic fungi from ethno-medicinal plant M. malabathricum.","Mishra, VK; Singh, G; Passari, AK; Yadav, MK; Gupta, VK; Singh, BP",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY,2016,NA,0.952750647481321,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.873731280135173,0.126268719864827,0.997711596485311,0.00228840351468906,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
16449,Genome-Wide Identification and Characterization of Effector Candidates with Conserved Motif in Falciphora oryzae,"Microbes employ effectors to disrupt immune responses and promote host colonization. Conserved motifs including RXLR, LFLAK-HVLVxxP (CRN), Y/F/WxC, CFEM, LysM, Chitin-bind, DPBB_1 (PNPi), and Cutinase have been discovered to play crucial roles in the functioning of effectors in filamentous fungi. Nevertheless, little is known about effectors with conserved motifs in endophytes. This research aims to discover the effector genes with conserved motifs in the genome of rice endophyte Falciphora oryzae. SignalP identified a total of 622 secreted proteins, out of which 227 were predicted as effector candidates by EffectorP. By utilizing HMM features, we discovered a total of 169 effector candidates with conserved motifs and three novel motifs. Effector candidates containing LysM, CFEM, DPBB_1, Cutinase, and Chitin_bind domains were conserved across species. In the transient expression assay, it was observed that one CFEM and one LysM activated cell death in tobacco leaves. Moreover, two CFEM and one Chitin_bind inhibited cell death induced by Bax protein. At various points during the infection, the genes’ expression levels were increased. These results will help to identify functional effector proteins involving omics methods using new bioinformatics tools, thus providing a basis for the study of symbiosis mechanisms. © 2024 by the authors.",Dai M.; Su Z.; Zhu X.; Li L.; Ye Z.; Tan X.; Kong D.; Liu X.; Lin F.,International Journal of Molecular Sciences,2024,10.3390/ijms25010650,0.979725276596043,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.978636528370721,0.0213634716292792,0.999990346750492,9.65324950807922e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18953,"Streptomyces albidocamelliae sp. nov., an endophytic actinomycete isolated from the leaves of Camellia oleifera.","A novel actinobacterium strain, HUAS 14-6T, was isolated from the healthy leaves of Camellia oleifera collected from Changde City, Hunan Province, China. Strain HUAS 14-6T produced tight spiral spore chains consisting of oval or spherical spores with a smooth surface. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain HUAS 14-6T belonged to the genus Streptomyces and shared highest similarity to Streptomyces bungoensis DSM 41781T (99.72%). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated strain HUAS 14-6T was in a clade with S. bungoensis DSM 41781T. However, the ANIm and dDDH between strain HUAS 14-6T and S. bungoensis DSM 41781T were 88.16% and 31.2%, respectively, far less than the species-level thresholds. Phylogenetic trees based on the five housekeeping genes (atpD, gyrB, recA, rpoB and trpB) showed that strain HUAS 14-6T formed a separate branch, indicating that this strain could belong to a potential new species. Pairwise MLSA distances between strain HUAS 14-6T and all type strains exhibiting 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of ≥98.7% to it were much higher than the maximum range of 0.014 recommended for delineating a new Streptomyces species. Based on polyphasic taxonomic study, HUAS 14-6T represents a novel species within the genus Streptomyces for which the name Streptomyces albidocamelliae sp. nov. is proposed.

16343,Root nodules of red alder (Alnus rubra) and sitka alder (Alnus viridis ssp. sinuata) are inhabited by taxonomically diverse cultivable microbial endophytes,"The root nodules of actinorhizal plants are home to nitrogen-fixing bacterial symbionts, known as Frankia, along with a small percentage of other microorganisms. These include fungal endophytes and non-Frankia bacteria. The taxonomic and functional diversity of the microbial consortia within these root nodules is not well understood. In this study, we surveyed and analyzed the cultivable, non-Frankia fungal and bacterial endophytes of root nodules from red and Sitka alder trees that grow together. We examined their taxonomic diversity, co-occurrence, differences between hosts, and potential functional roles. For the first time, we are reporting numerous fungal endophytes of alder root nodules. These include Sporothrix guttuliformis, Fontanospora sp., Cadophora melinii, an unclassified Cadophora, Ilyonectria destructans, an unclassified Gibberella, Nectria ramulariae, an unclassified Trichoderma, Mycosphaerella tassiana, an unclassified Talaromyces, Coniochaeta sp., and Sistotrema brinkmanii. We are also reporting several bacterial genera for the first time: Collimonas, Psychrobacillus, and Phyllobacterium. Additionally, we are reporting the genus Serratia for the second time, with the first report having been recently published in 2023. Pseudomonas was the most frequently isolated bacterial genus and was found to co-inhabit individual nodules with both fungi and bacteria. We found that the communities of fungal endophytes differed by host species, while the communities of bacterial endophytes did not. © 2024 The Authors.

12830,Improvement of nitrogen accumulation and metabolism in rice (Oryza sativa L.) by the endophyte Phomopsis liquidambari,"The fungal endophyte Phomopsis liquidambari can enhance nitrogen (N) uptake and metabolism of rice plants under hydroponic conditions. To investigate the effects of P. liquidambari on N accumulation and metabolism in rice (Oryza sativa L) under field conditions during the entire growing season (S1, the seedling stage; S2, the tillering stage; S3, the heading stage; S4, the ripening stage), we utilized pot experiments to examine metabolic and physiological levels in both shoot and root tissues of rice, with endophyte (E+) and without endophyte (E-), in response to three different N levels. We found that under low-N treatment, P. liquidambari symbiosis increased the rice yield and N use efficiency by 12% and by 11.59%, respectively; that the total N contents in E+ rice plants at the four growth stages were separately increased by 29.05%, 14.65%, 21.06% and 18.38%, respectively; and that the activities of nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase in E+ rice roots and shoots were significantly increased by fungal infection during the S1 to S3 stages. Moreover, P. liquidambari significantly increased the free NH4+, NO3-, amino acid and soluble protein contents in infected rice tissues under low-N treatment during the S1 to S3 stages. The obtained results offer novel data concerning the systemic changes induced by P. liquidambari in rice during the entire growth period and confirm the hypothesis that the rice -P. liquidambari interaction improved the N accumulation and metabolism of rice plants, consequently increasing rice N utilization in nutrient-limited soil.

14634,Research article growth effect of Cinnamomum kanehirae cuttings associated with its dark septate endophytes,"Background and Objective: Stout camphor tree (Cinnamomum kanehirae Hay.) is an endemic specie in Taiwan and cutting is the major propagation of C kanehirae for plantation. Mycorrhiza can accelerate the growth of the host plant, especially in root of the host plant. The objective of this study was to investigate the growth effect of the 2 dark septate endophytes isolated from C kanehirae. Materials and Methods: To measure the effects of stains CkDB2 and CkDB5 on growth performance of cuttings, the cuttings were carefully removed from their substrate after 9 months of incubation. Each treatment had three replicates. Results: After 9 month incubation, the mycorrhizal synthesis experiment showed that the roots of synthesized cuttings produced microsclerotia, a characteristic of dark septate endophyte, but nothing was found in the control. All inoculated cuttings had higher values of net height growth, dry weight, leaf area and chlorophyll concentration than the control. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the 2 endophytes, strains CkDB2 and CkDB5, capable of forming microsclerotia with C kanehirae cuttings were dark septate endophytes. Based on the results, CkDB5 had a better growth response than CkDB2. Cuttings inoculated with CkDB5 showed a 200% increase in the root dry weight and therefore, CkDB5 could presumably be a prerequisite for the survival of C kanehirae cutting plantation. © 2016 Lei-Chen Lin.",Lin L.-C.,Pakistan Journal of Biological Sciences,2016,10.3923/pjbs.2016.299.305,0.992983938054217,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996457256450312,0.00354274354968759,0.999999999995142,4.8580028888523e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11078,Exploring the Potential Applications of Paecilomyces lilacinus 112,"Microorganisms are widely used to obtain biostimulants that can facilitate the assimilation of nutrients, ensuring high crop yield and quality. A particular category of biostimulants are protein hydrolyzates (PH), obtained from microbial cultures grown on a nutrient medium. In the present study, Paecilomyces lilacinus 112, an endophytic fungus isolated from soil, was tested to determine its effect on the growth promotion of tomato seedlings in greenhouse conditions. Additionally, other beneficial features of the P. lilacinus isolate were evaluated via several tests: antagonism against plant pathogenic fungi, production of secondary useful metabolites, and solubilization of vital micronutrients. Out of the tested pathogens, P. lilacinus exhibited the highest antifungal activity against a Cladosporium isolate (inhibition of 66.3%), followed by Rhizoctonia. solani (52.53%), and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (50.23%). Paecilomyces lilacinus 112 was able to secrete hydrolytic enzymes and siderophores, and solubilize zinc and phosphorus. In the tomato treatment, the application of PH obtained from fungal cultivation on a feather medium led to the following increases in plant growth parameters: 3.54-fold in plant biomass; 3.26-fold in plant height, 1.28-fold in plant diameter; 1.5-fold in the number of branches/plant; and 1.43-fold in the number of leaves/plant, as compared to water treatment. The application of this isolate can be of benefit to bioeconomy because keratin wastes are valorized and returned, in agriculture, contributing to renewable natural resources.","Constantin, M; Raut, I; Gurban, AM; Doni, M; Radu, N; Alexandrescu, E; Jecu, L",APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL,2022,10.3390/app12157572,0.993442469322217,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.956162188871114,0.0438378111288858,0.999999999197707,8.02292565715845e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Currently, antimicrobial resistance is one of the most important threats to global public health. This is due to the various mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance. Thus, the need for new sources of bioactive compounds outside conventional antibiotics is a top priority. This investigation evaluated the diversity and antibacterial activities of endophytic fungi isolated from the leaves and root bark of jambu mawar (Syzygium jambos (L.) Alston). The endophytic fungi were grown on PDA media, and their antibacterial activities were tested using the Kirby-Bauer method on two Gram-positive and two Gram-negative bacteria. A total of 10 (SJD1-SJD10) and 11 isolates (SJA1-SJA11) of endophytic fungi were identified from the leaves and root bark of S. jambos, respectively. Among them, SJA8 isolate exhibited strong antibacterial activity. Based on morphological characterization and phylogenetic tree analysis, SJA8 was identified as Pleiocarpon livistonae.

3468,Endophytes dominate fungal communities in six-year-old veteranisation wounds in living oak trunks,"Old trees are rare in the landscape, as are many of their associated species. Veteranisation is a method by which attempts are made to create microhabitats, otherwise found only in old trees, in younger trees at an earlier stage than would occur naturally. Here, we analysed the early fungal succession in 6 y-old veteranisation wounds in ca. 100 y old living oak trunks by DNA-barcoding of the wood at eight sites in Sweden and Norway. We hypothesised basidiomycetes would be most abundant, and exposed sapwood and heartwood would select for different communities. We identified 686 fungal taxa, mainly ascomycetes, with a large overlap in species composition and surprisingly similar species richness, i.e. 325 vs. 308-360, between intact and different types of damaged wood, respectively. Endophytes continued to be present and common in damaged wood. The results demonstrate that damage to sapwood and heartwood partly select for different fungi and that 6 y is too early to evaluate if veteranisation can positively favour fungi of conservation interest.(c) 2020 The Authors.

With the sporadic appearance of clonal lineage US-8, classified as resistant to mefenoxam and of the A2 mating type, there is a need for ongoing monitoring and characterization. Isolates of P. infestans collected from Wisconsin during the 2017 and 2018 growing seasons were tested for sensitivity to mefenoxam with discriminatory dose of 100 ppm. In 2017, both US-23 and US-8 were isolated. On average, isolates of US-23 were significantly more sensitive to mefenoxam than were US-8 isolates (P = 8e-04). There were significant differences in the sensitivity levels among the US-8 isolates (P = 2.02e-06), with a single isolate testing sensitive at 100 ppm of mefenoxam based on the oneway ANOVA. There were significant differences in the sensitivity levels among US-23 isolates (P = 3.75e-09), with two isolates showing resistance. In 2018 only US-23 was found, and isolates were tested for mefenoxam response at 0, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 ppm. At 0.1 ppm, isolates showed significantly different levels of sensitivity (P = 2.1e-09), and a single isolate showed complete resistance. Isolates from both clonal lineages and years that exhibited moderate levels of resistance had greater variability among replicates. The phenotype of this multigenic trait comes through in the variability seen in isolates that are showing more resistance. Continued screening of P. infestans for mefenoxam sensitivity will help track the development and mechanism of resistance, as well as aid in development of best management approaches.","Larson, ER; Migliano, LE; Chen, Y; Gevens, AJ",PLANT HEALTH PROGRESS,2021,10.1094/PHP-02-21-0044-FI,0.927294890451472,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.983097438600628,0.0169025613993718,0.999999999152678,8.4732176830471e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18474,Diversity and bioprospecting of actinomycete endophytes from the medicinal plants.,"The endophytic actinomycetes constitute one of the fascinating group of microorganisms associated with a wide range of plant species.

Nevertheless, their diversity correlates with the occurrence in plant species harboured in unique regions of biologically diverse areas called ""hot spots."" Recent advances in the isolation techniques have facilitated the isolation of rare taxa from these environments. The biosynthetic ability of the endophytic actinomycetes has proven beyond doubt that these organisms have the potential to synthesize an array of compounds with novelty in structure and bioactivity and as a result are preferred in the natural product screening programs. In the years to come, the scientific world may await to discover many more novel actinomycete taxa with metabolic diversity and applications in therapeutics.
