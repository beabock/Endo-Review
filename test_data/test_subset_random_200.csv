1362,Differences in endophyte communities of introduced trees depend on the phylogenetic relatedness of the receiving forest,"Plant species sometimes perform extraordinarily well when introduced to new environments, through achieving higher growth rates, individual biomasses or higher densities in their receiving communities compared to their native range communities. One hypothesis proposed to explain enhanced performance in species' new environments is that their soil microbial communities may be different and provide greater benefit than microbial communities encountered in species' native environments. However, detailed descriptions of soil biota associated with species in both their native and introduced environments remain scarce. We established a global network of sites in regions where the tree species Pinus contorta has been introduced (Chile, New Zealand, Finland, Scotland and Sweden), as well as native range sites where the introduced populations originated (Canada and USA). We conducted pyrosequencing analysis to compare the root fungal endophyte communities associated with P.contorta in its native environments and in introduced environments with phylogenetically similar and dissimilar tree species (i.e. P.sylvestris in Europe and Nothofagus spp. in the Southern Hemisphere). Fungal communities associated with P.contorta consistently differed between its introduced and native environments. In Europe, P.contorta associated with the same community as P.sylvestris, where one particular species (Piloderma sphaerosporum) was particularly abundant relative to Canadian sites. In the Southern Hemisphere, P.contorta fungal communities were composed primarily of North American taxa and exhibited very little overlap with fungal communities associated with native Nothofagus spp.Synthesis. Our work shows that plants exhibit considerable plasticity in their interaction with fungi, by associating with different fungal communities across native and introduced environments. Our work also indicates that fungal communities associated with introduced plants can assemble through different mechanisms, that is by associating with existing fungal communities of phylogenetically close species, or through reassembly of co-introduced and co-invading fungi. The identification of different fungal communities in a plant species new environment provides an important step forward in understanding how soil biota may impact growth and invasion when a species is introduced to new environments.","Gundale, MJ; Almeida, JP; Wallander, H; Wardle, DA; Kardol, P; Nilsson, MC; Fajardo, A; Pauchard, A; Peltzer, DA; Ruotsalainen, S; Mason, B; Rosenstock, N",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,2016,10.1111/1365-2745.12595,0.878560205553843,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999972993667548,2.70063324516871e-5,0.999999988919986,1.1080014017395e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

15291,Antioxidant and Antibacterial Activities of Endophytic Fungi Extracts of Syzygium zeylanicum,"Syzygium zeylanicum, one of the other therapeutic plants found in Indonesia, is used to treat various ailments, such as antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, arthritis, antidiabetic, mosquitocidal, antitumor, and anti-rheumatic agents. The massive use of plant extracts has caused the development of isolation of bioactive compounds thru their endophytic. The present research aimed to obtain endophytic fungal isolates from the stem bark and leaves of Jambu nasi-nasi (S. zeylanicum) and analyze endophytic fungal extracts’ antioxidant and antibacterial activity. Endophyte identification was performed morphologically, and isolates with high biological activity were molecularly characterized. The antibacterial activity was evaluated by the disc diffusion method, and the antioxidant activity was evaluated by the DPPH method. In total, 10 endophytic fungi were isolated and identified as Phialemonium sp. (Code SZT3), Acremonium sp. (Code SZT4), Trichoderma aureoviridae (Code SZT5), Trichoderma koningi (Code SZT7), Phytium torulosum (Code SZL1), Phytium zingiberum (Code SZL2), Septonema sp. (Code SZL3), Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae (Code SZL4), Volutella cilliata (SZL5), and Trichophyton mentagrophytes (Code SZL7). Isolate SZL4 gave activity the highest antioxidant (IC50 = 3.30 μg/mL) and strong antibacterial activity against four pathogens bacterial (S. thypi, B. subtilis, S. aureus, and E. coli). The potential endophytic fungi based on molecular analysis was Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae with accession number OK668257.

15681,Secondary metabolites of endophytic fungi from newbouldia laevis and cassia tora leaves: Prospecting for new antimicrobial agents,"Aim: This study tries to find new antimicrobial agents using some Nigerian plants. Background: Antimicrobial compounds from fungi endophytes have shown great promise in mitigating the threats of resistant pathogens. Objective: The study evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial property of secondary metabolites of endophytic fungi isolated from Newbouldia laevis and Cassia tora leaves. Methods: Ten endophytic fungi were isolated from the two plants’ leaves and later fermented on local rice for 21 days. Thereafter, their secondary metabolites were extracted using ethyl acetate. The antibacterial activity of the extracts on the test organisms were determined using agar diffusion and agar dilution methods, while the bioactive constituents were identified using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detector. Results: Nine of the crude extracts (NL1, NL3, NL6, NL10, NL12, CT2, CT7, CT9 and CT10) of the fungi isolates inhibited at least one of the microorganisms studied with maximum and minimum inhibition-zone-diameter of 14 mm and 2 mm, respectively while CT1 did not inhibit any of the tested microorganisms at tested concentrations. The extracts exhibited good antifungal activity, inhibiting the growth of both C. albicans and Trichophyton tested with an inhibition-zone-diameter ranging between 4-8 mm and 7-14 mm, respectively. The endophytic fungi extracts-CT2 and NL1-exhibited the best antimicrobial activity, inhibiting most of the tested microorganisms. HPLC-DAD analysis of the endophytic fungal extracts identified some classes of compounds such as catechin derivatives, benzoic acid derivatives and apigenin, which were previously reported to have antimicrobial potentials. Conclusion: Newbouldia laevis and Cassia tora leaves house endophytic fungi capable of yielding secondary metabolites with potential as anti-infective agents. © 2021 Bentham Science Publishers.",Amaechi A.A.; Oli A.N.; Okezie U.M.; Adejumo S.A.; Abba C.C.; Okeke I.J.; Okoye F.B.C.,Recent Advances in Anti-Infective Drug Discovery,2021,10.2174/1574891X15999201222152646,0.941921950729321,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99866412637451,0.00133587362548998,0.99999986498402,1.35015980284869e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

On increasing the precursor concentration from 2 to 10 mM, there is a shift in paramagnetic to weak ferromagnetic behavior of nanoparticles with the increase in saturation magnetization (M-s) from 0.161 to 7.75 emu/g. Frequency dependence of dielectric constant is found to increase with an increase in frequency, and the aforementioned nanoparticles can be used as a dielectric up to 1,50,000 Hz as dissipation factor is lesser than one. Besides, photostability study has indicated that the particles are stable for at least 45 days. Through liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis, phytochelatins are identified to be involved in the biosynthesis of nanoparticles.","Vijayanandan, AS; Balakrishnan, RM",APPLIED PHYSICS A-MATERIALS SCIENCE & PROCESSING,2020,10.1007/s00339-020-3395-x,0.980228170930029,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.975559498568892,0.0244405014311075,0.999999582642978,4.17357022275411e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1743,Predicting interactions of the frass-associated yeast Hyphopichia heimii with Olea europaea subsp. cuspidata and twig-boring bark beetles,"Bark beetles are destructive insect pests known to form symbioses with different fungal taxa, including yeasts. The aim of this study was to (1) determine the prevalence of the rare yeast Hyphopichia heimii in bark beetle frass from wild olive trees in South Africa and to (2) predict the potential interaction of this yeast with trees and bark beetles. Twenty-eight culturable yeast species were isolated from frass in 35 bark beetle galleries, including representatives of H. heimii from nine samples. Physiological characterization of H. heimii isolates revealed that none was able to degrade complex polymers present in hemicellulose; however, all were able to assimilate sucrose and cellobiose, sugars associated with an arboreal habitat. All isolates were able to produce the auxin indole acetic acid, indicative of a potential symbiosis with the tree. Sterol analysis revealed that the isolates possessed ergosterol quantities ranging from 3.644 +/- 0.119 to 13.920 +/- 1.230 mg/g dry cell weight, which suggested that H. heimii could serve as a source of sterols in bark beetle diets, as is known for other bark beetle-associated fungi. In addition, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated that at least one of the isolates, Hyphopichia heimii CAB 1614, was able to convert the insect pheromone cis-verbenol to the anti-aggregation pheromone verbenone. This indicated that H. heimii could potentially influence beetle behaviour. These results support the contention of a tripartite symbiosis between H. heimii, olive trees, and bark beetles.","Asmus, JJ; Toplis, B; Roets, F; Botha, A",FOLIA MICROBIOLOGICA,2022,10.1007/s12223-022-00985-2,0.97307616090315,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.985755730389218,0.0142442696107817,0.999999481032678,5.18967321561092e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11781,Postglacial colonization history reflects in the genetic structure of natural populations of Festuca rubra in Europe,"We conducted a large-scale population genetic survey of genetic diversity of the host grass Festuca rubra s.l., which fitness can be highly dependent on its symbiotic fungus Epichloe festucae, to evaluate genetic variation and population structure across the European range. The 27 studied populations have previously been found to differ in frequencies of occurrence of the symbiotic fungus E. festucae and ploidy levels. As predicted, we found decreased genetic diversity in previously glaciated areas in comparison with nonglaciated regions and discovered three major maternal genetic groups: southern, northeastern, and northwestern Europe. Interestingly, host populations from Greenland were genetically similar to those from the Faroe Islands and Iceland, suggesting gene flow also between those areas. The level of variation among populations within regions is evidently highly dependent on the postglacial colonization history, in particular on the number of independent long-distance seed colonization events. Yet, also anthropogenic effects may have affected the population structure in F. rubra. We did not observe higher fungal infection rates in grass populations with lower levels of genetic variability. In fact, the fungal infection rates of E. festucae in relation to genetic variability of the host populations varied widely among geographical areas, which indicate differences in population histories due to colonization events and possible costs of systemic fungi in harsh environmental conditions. We found that the plants of different ploidy levels are genetically closely related within geographic areas indicating independent formation of polyploids in different maternal lineages.","von Cräutlein, M; Leinonen, PH; Korpelainen, H; Helander, M; Väre, H; Saikkonen, K",ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,2019,10.1002/ece3.4997,0.977432646469154,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995982867095872,0.00401713290412762,0.999993710305799,6.28969420068959e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
9312,Functional roles of fungal endophytes in host fitness during stress conditions,"Fungal endophytes live symbiotically within healthy plant tissues and found to be associated with all host plants studied till date in all natural ecosystems with varied geographical areas. These microbes benefit the plants by conferring resistance to several biotic and abiotic stresses and also influence the soil rhizosphere environment. The endophytic fungi may affect plant phenotypic and functional traits by promoting nutrient/mineral uptake and alters defensive pathways. The importance of fungal endophytes to ecosystem functioning via soil processes is also aroused increasing interest during the past decade as host-fungal interaction affects ecology, distribution, and diversity of plants. The present review ascertains the role of fungal endophytes on host ecological fitness during different stress conditions.","Naik, BS",SYMBIOSIS,2019,10.1007/s13199-019-00635-1,0.972289232243757,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997472959292733,0.00252704070726745,0.999999999996791,3.20898863037655e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
11676,Identification of meroterpenoids from Bipolaris victoriae S27 and their potential activity against tumor metastasis and inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway,"Three undescribed meroterpenoids, named bipolacochlioquinones A-C, together with seven known compounds, were isolated from the plant endophytic fungus Bipolaris victoriae S27 derived from the fresh stems of Rubia podantha Diels. Their structures were mainly determined by extensive spectroscopic analysis. The relative configurations of bipolacochlioquinones A-C were assigned using the ROESY spectrum, comparison of their spectral data with that reported in the literatures, and NMR calculations. Moreover, their complete absolute configurations were further established by electronic circular dichroism calculations using density functional theory. Among them, bipolacochlioquinone A is found to represent the first example of previously undescribed 6/6/6/6/6 pentacyclic dioxane-containing cochlioquinones, and bipolacochlioquinone B possesses a rare 6/6/6/6/5 pentacyclic system bearing a tetrahydrofuran ring fused to a polyketide and a sesquiterpenoid subunit. All compounds were evaluated for their inhibitory effects on tumor growth, metastasis, and the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Among them, bipolacochlioquinone C and cochlioquinone A show the most potent cytotoxicities and NF-kappa B inhibitory activities. The effects of bipolacochlioquinone C and cochlioquinone A on the expression of NF-kappa B-associated proteins were also evaluated using western blotting. These results indicate that bipolacochlioquinone C and cochlioquinone A can inhibit the growth and metastasis of HCT116 and MDA-MB-231 cells by suppressing the NF-kappa B signaling pathway.","Feng, L; Wang, XJ; Li, L; Zhang, AX; Shang, RR; Tan, NH; Wang, Z",PHYTOCHEMISTRY,2022,10.1016/j.phytochem.2022.113180,0.871571460490978,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999444919663238,5.5508033676232e-4,0.999999997474658,2.5253416024995102e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1546,Spatial responses of two herbivore groups to a geometrid larva on mountain birch,"Direct or plant-mediated interactions between herbivores may modify their spatial distribution among and within plants. In this study, we examined the effect of a leaf-chewing geometrid, the autumnal moth (Epirrita autumnata), on two different herbivore groups, leaf rolling Deporaus betulae weevils and Eriocrania spp. leafminers, both feeding on mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp. czerepanovii). The exact locations of herbivores within tree canopies were mapped during three successive summers. In the first 2 years, some trees were artificially colonized by eggs of the autumnal moth to induce both rapid and delayed resistance in the foliage. The natural infection levels of the pathogenic rust fungus (Melampsoridium betulinum), potentially involved in species interactions, were also recorded. At the level of the whole tree, the density of D. betulae leaf rolls was lower in trees infested by the autumnal moth in the same year. However, the feeding locations within trees were partly segregated: D. betulae favoured shadier branches, while E. autumnata preferred the sunny parts of the canopy. The autumnal moth did not affect current- or following-year density of leafminers at the tree or branch level. Trees infected by rust had fewer leafminers in the same summer than noninfected trees. There were no interaction effects between defoliation by the autumnal moth and rust infection, and no delayed effects on the abundance of other herbivores the following year. Taken together, these findings suggest that the autumnal moth has a negative, partially plant-mediated impact on D. betulae, and can reduce the extent of current-year defoliation caused by D. betulae. This may be beneficial for the mountain birch, since the greater part of D. betulae damage occurs around or after the end of the larval period of the autumnal moth, which may be a critical time for tree recovery after moth outbreaks.","Riihimäki, J; Kaitaniemi, P; Ruohomäki, K",OECOLOGIA,2003,10.1007/s00442-002-1082-6,0.699451620787856,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.96390239259463,0.03609760740537,0.99999999994138,5.861955365560329e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
10929,STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE GAMETOPHYTE OF PSILOTUM-NUDUM,"The gametophytes used in this study amounted to about 600 and belonged to a race of Psilotum nodum growing in the greenhouses of the Bot. Dept., U. Minn. The race was probably introduced with other plants from the Gulf-Caribbean area during the 1920''s. The descr. of the vegetative features is in accordance with published accounts dealing with the previous collections of gametophytes. It was concluded that the endophytic fungus is non-specific, i.e., may be one of several spp. There is present in the apex of the gametophyte a pyramidal spical cell with 3 cutting faces. This condition is often obscured by differential enlargement and accompanying changes in shape of adjacent cells when the division of the apical cell are infrequent. The naked apices experience various degrees of injury under natural conditions within a coarse substratum. New apical cells differentiate following apical injuries, and this results in the formation of various types of ramification. The discontinuous vascular strand is primarily referable to shifts in the bulk of the apical meristem as influenced by apical injury and subsequent repairatory activity. All of the gametophytes are assumed to be potential producers of vascular strands. The branching patterns are primarily environmentally controlled. They are genetically controlled only in that the gametophytes have the inherent ability to differentiate apical cells, and subsequently new apices, following a disturbance of the apical meristem. The unqualified use of the expression ""dichotomous branching pattern"" should be avoided.","BIERHORST, DW",AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY,1953,10.2307/2439676,0.9897455959453,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.865375571754202,0.134624428245798,0.999999892730074,1.07269925719855e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
16808,First Report of Crown Rot and Stem Rot Caused by Rhizoctonia solani AG-4 on Marmalade Bush in Italy.,"Marmalade bush (Streptosolen jamesonii (Benth.) Miers), also known as fire bush, is an evergreen, perennial shrub in the family Solanaceae, which is native to South America (Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru). In Italy, this species is cultivated as an ornamental creeper or bush. During September 2009, a new disease was observed in a stock of ~10,000 pot-grown, 2-month-old plants of marmalade bush in a nursery in eastern Sicily, Italy. More than 50% of the plants exhibited symptoms of disease. Disease symptoms consisted of extensive water-soaked, dark brown lesions at the crown level that girdled entire stems and an internal brown discoloration of cortical tissue. Infected plants died within a few days. Diseased tissue was disinfested for 10 s in 1% NaOCl, rinsed with sterile water, and plated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with streptomycin sulfate at 100 mg/liter. Fungal colonies were initially white, turned brown after 2 to 3 days, and produced irregularly shaped, brown sclerotia. Microscopic examination showed mycelium consistent with Rhizoctonia solani Kühn that branched at right angles, constricted at the base of the branch originating from primary hyphae, and septate near the constriction. The number of nuclei per hyphal cell was determined on cultures grown at 25°C on 2% water agar in petri plates by staining with 1% safranin O and 3% KOH solution (1) and examined at ×400. The hyphal cells were all multinucleate. Anastomosis group was determined by pairing isolates on 2% water agar in petri plates (2). Pairings were made with tester strains AG-1 IA, AG-2-2-1, AG-2-2IIIB, AG-2-2IV, AG-3, AG-4, AG-5, AG-6, and AG-11. Anastomosis was observed only with tester isolates of AG-4. Pathogenicity tests were performed by placing 1-cm2 plugs of PDA from 5-day-old mycelial cultures near the base of the stem on 25 potted, healthy, 2-month-old rooted cuttings of marmalade bush. The same number of plants treated with 1-cm2 PDA plugs served as controls. Following inoculation, all plants were maintained for 20 days at 25°C and 95% relative humidity under a 12-h fluorescent light/dark regimen. Crown and stem symptoms, identical to those observed in the nursery, developed 5 days after inoculation on all inoculated plants. Control plants remained symptomless. R. solani was consistently reisolated from symptomatic tissues and identified as previously described. To our knowledge, this is the first report of R. solani causing disease on marmalade bush.

The effects of plant tissue and growth stage on endophyte assemblages were characterized. Endophytes were recovered from 50 % of the samples, with a total of 714 isolates. 41 operational taxonomical units (OTUs) were identified, consisting of 40 OTUs belonging primarily to Ascomycota and 1 OTU belonging to Basidiomycota. Pleosporales and Hypocreales were the orders contributing the most species to the endophytic assemblages. The total colonization frequency and species richness of endophytic fungi were higher in roots than in leaves and stems. In addition, for the plant tissues, the structure of fungal communities differed significantly by growth stages of leaf emergence and dormancy; for the plant growth stages, the structure of fungal communities differed significantly by plant tissues. This study demonstrates that S. chamaejasme serves as a reservoir for a wide variety of fungal endophytes that can be isolated from various plant tissues.","Jin, H; Yan, ZQ; Liu, Q; Yang, XY; Chen, JX; Qin, B",ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY,2013,10.1007/s10482-013-0014-2,0.958732447463203,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.921334695977841,0.0786653040221593,0.803034800770214,0.196965199229786,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The aim of the study was to investigate the characteristics of endophytic and epiphytic fungal communities of the litterin C. equisetifolia forests (young?aged forest, middle?aged forest and mature?aged forest) at Guilinyang coast of Haikou,Hainan province, China. The ITS rDNA was sequenced by Illumina high?throughput sequencing technology, which was usedto analyze the diversity of the microbial communities of the litter from different aged forests. The litter and soilphysicochemical properties were measured to determine the correlations between them. A total of 669,476 valid sequenceswere obtained for all samples and contained 6 phyla, 23 classes, 59 orders, 119 families, 212 genus, and 314 species. Thediversity and abundance of the epiphytic fungal communities of the C. equisetifolia litter was higher than those of theendophytic fungi. There were greater similarity among the endophytic and epiphytic fungal community compositions. It wasfound that Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the main fungi of the litter. There were three dominant orders exist in bothendophytic and epiphytic fungal communities, including Capnodiales, Xylariales and Auriculariales. Coniochaetales,Magnaporthales and another two orders were specially distributed in the litter, while Basidiobolales and Trichosporonaleswere endemic to epiphytic fungi.

Moench) variety Arka anamika were treated with 5 fungicides including Anucop, Bavistin, Captan, Dithane M-45 and Vitavax with different doses (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3%) and the combination Anucop + Bavistin, Anucop + Captan, Anucop + Vitavax, Bavistin + Vitavax, Anucop + Dithane, Bavistin + Dithane, Bavistin + Captan, Captan + Vitavax, Anucop + Bavistin + Captan, Anucop + Bavistin + Dithane, Anucop + Captan + Vitavax, Bavistin + Captan + Vitavax were used to test their potency against the seed-borne fungal diseases. Among these, Anucop at a concentration of 0.3%, Bavistin @ 0.2%, Captan @ 0.3%, Dithane @ 0.3%, Vitavax @ 0.3% and their combinations, like Anucop + Bavistin, Anucop + Dithane, Bavistin + Dithane, Anucop + Captan + Vitavax, Bavistin + Captan + Vitavax were most effective in the improvement of crop both in greenhouse and field conditions. These chemicals at different doses and in combinations increased the total number of leaves, fruits, mean length, girth and biomass of fruits. Apart from these, the total number of seeds per fruit, seed density and weight and ascorbic acid content were also enhanced. These chemicals reduced the incidence of seed mycoflora, thereby enhancing the seed germination percentage and vigour index of the seedlings. © 2008 Asian Network for Scientific Information.",Begum M.; Lokesh S.,International Journal of Botany,2008,10.3923/ijb.2008.24.32,0.932537823645831,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99872998360785,0.00127001639215035,0.999992405375856,7.59462414434697e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2109,The Fungal Endophyte Penicillium olsonii ML37 Reduces Fusarium Head Blight by Local Induced Resistance in Wheat Spikes,"The fungal endophyte Penicillium olsonii ML37 is a biocontrol agent of Fusarium head blight in wheat (caused by Fusarium graminearum), which has shown a limited direct inhibition of fungal growth in vitro. We used RNA-seq and LC-MS/MS analyses to elucidate metabolic interactions of the three-way system Penicillium-wheat-Fusarium in greenhouse experiments. We demonstrated that P. olsonii ML37 colonises wheat spikes and transiently activates plant defence mechanisms, as pretreated spikes show a faster and stronger expression of the defence metabolism during the first 24 h after pathogen inoculation. This effect was transient and the expression of the same genes was lower in the pathogen-infected spikes than in those infected by P. olsonii alone. This response to the endophyte includes the transcriptional activation of several WRKY transcription factors. This early activation is associated with a reduction in FHB symptoms and significantly lower levels of the F. graminearum metabolites 15-acetyl-DON and culmorin. An increase in the Penicillium-associated metabolite asperphanamate confirms colonisation by the endophyte. Our results suggest that the mode of action used by P. olsonii ML37 is via a local defence activation in wheat spikes, and that this fungus has potential as a novel biological alternative in wheat disease control.","Rojas, EC; Jensen, B; Jorgensen, HJL; Latz, MAC; Esteban, P; Collinge, DB",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2022,10.3390/jof8040345,0.975640786298933,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.992890454812459,0.00710954518754148,0.999961255535023,3.87444649770918e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
17642,First Report of Root and Basal Stem Rot Caused by Phytophthora nicotianae on Tree Aeonium (Aeonium arboreum) in Italy.,"The genus Aeonium, family Crassulaceae, comprises approximately 35 species that are native to northern Africa and the Canary Islands. Tree aeonium (Aeonium arboreum (L.) Webb & Berthel.) is a bushy, perennial succulent with rosettes of tender, waxy leaves at the apex of few-branched or occasionally single, naked stems. Mature rosettes bear yellowish inflorescences. Aeoniums are cultivated as ornamentals in gardens and containers. During the summer of 2009, in a garden in eastern Sicily (southern Italy), 3-year-old potted plants of tree aeonium showed stunting, shrivelling, and chlorosis of leaves and drop of external leaves associated with root and basal stem rot. Drops of an amber exudate oozed from the basal stem. Tissues of the basal stem were soft, but no external necrosis was visible. A species of Phytophthora was consistently isolated from symptomatic roots and basal stem tissues on a medium selective for Oomycetes (2). Axenic cultures were obtained by single-hypha transfers. The pathogen was identified by morphological criteria as Phytophthora nicotianae B. de Haan; it formed stoloniferous colonies on potato dextrose agar and grew between 8 and 38°C, with the optimum at 30°C. On V8 juice agar it produced spherical, intercalary chlamydospores (mean diameter of 26 μm) and persistent, mono- and bipapillate, spherical to ovoid, ellipsoid, obpyriform sporangia that measured 29 to 56 × 22 to 45 μm with a mean length/breadth ratio of 1.3:1. All isolates were A2 mating type and formed spherical oogonia (mean diameter 28 ± 2 μm) with smooth walls and amphigynous antheridia in dual cultures with a reference isolate of the A1 mating type of P. nicotianae. BLAST analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA of a representative isolate from aeonium (IMI 398812, GenBank Accession No. HQ433333) amplified by PCR using the ITS6/ITS4 universal primers (1), revealed 99% similarity with the sequences of a reference isolate of P. nicotianae available in GenBank (Accession No. EU331089.1). Pathogenicity of isolate IMI 398812 was demonstrated by transplanting cuttings of A. arboreum into pots filled with a mixture of steam-sterilized sandy loam soil and inoculum (4% vol/vol) produced by growing the isolate for 20 days on wheat kernels. Ten plants were transplanted into 3-liter pots (two plants per pot) while 10 plants, transplanted into pots filled with a mixture of steam-sterilized soil and noninoculated kernels, were used as controls. Plants were kept in a greenhouse at 25 to 28°C and watered daily to field capacity. Thirty to forty days after the transplanting into infested soil, cuttings developed the same symptoms observed on plants with natural infections. Control plants remained symptomless. P. nicotianae was reisolated from symptomatic plants, thereby completing Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. nicotianae on an Aeonium species worldwide. The economic relevance of this disease is minor because aeoniums are not cultivated on a large scale. Moreover, the disease may be easily prevented by avoiding excess irrigation water since aeoniums need a well-drained soil or potting mix and do not tolerate soil waterlogging. References: (1) D. E.

8515,"Fungicidal and plant growth-promoting traits of Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae, an endophyte from Andrographis paniculata","IntrodutionFungal endophytes are widespread and dwell inside plant cells for at least part of their life without producing any symptoms of infection. Distinct host plants may have different fungal endophyte rates and community compositions. Despite this, the endophytic fungi connected with the host plant and their hostile behaviors, remain unknown. MethodsThe objective of the current research was to isolate and identify endophytic fungal species from the root of Andrographis paniculata. The effects of fungal isolate APR5 on the mycelial growth of phytopathogens and the production of plant-promoting traits were assessed. Results and discussionEndophytic fungal isolate APR5 showed higher inhibitory efficacy in dual and double plate assay against the tested phytopathogenic fungi. The scanning electron microscope analysis demonstrated that the phytopathogenic fungal hyphae were coiled by endophytes which makes them shrink and disintegrate. Further, an ethyl acetate crude extract effectively suppressed the mycelium growth of Rhizoctonia solani by 75 & PLUSMN; 0.1% in an agar well diffusion assay. The fungal isolate APR5 was identified as Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae using the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and qualitatively evaluated for their capacity to produce plant growth-promoting hormones. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was implemented to acquire a preliminary understanding of the secondary metabolic profile of ethyl acetate crude extract. 1-octadecene, erythritol, niacin, oleic acid, phenol, pantolactone, phenyl ethyl alcohol, p-cresol, and tbutyl hydroquinone are the metabolites analyzed in a crude extract of APR5 isolate and are reported to have antimicrobial properties.","Segaran, G; Sathiavelu, M",FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE,2023,10.3389/fpls.2023.1125630,0.889906071972868,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996296335594068,0.00370366440593217,0.999999999967396,3.2603808541864497e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18827,Isolation and optimization of Bacillus thuringiensis BRB-3 isolated from germinated black upland rice seeds for GABA production.,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a non-coded amino acid that recently gained increased attention within the functional food industry. This study aimed to isolate endophytic bacteria from sterilized surfaces of germinated black upland rice seeds for GABA production and optimization. A total of 38 isolates were screened for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity using a colorimetric method. Among these, thirteen isolates exhibited positive GAD activity. The BRB-3 strain emerged as the most promising, producing the highest GABA levels (4.54 g/L) at an optimal pH of 6.5. However, the BRB-3 strain was sensitive to pH lower than 5.5; so the pH was adjusted to 6.5 through all experiments. Further identification of the BRB-3 strain was performed using 16S rRNA gene sequence, which placed it in Bacillus cereus group. Subsequent rpoB gene sequence analysis confirmed that the BRB-3 strain was Bacillus thuringiensis BRB-3. GABA production was optimized in MRS broth by investigating carbon, nitrogen, monosodium glutamate (MSG), pH and temperature. Interestingly, the concentration of MSG did not impact GABA production of B. thuringiensis BRB-3. Under optimal conditions of 3 % soy protein as the nitrogen source, 2 % sucrose, no added MSG at 30 °C, pH 6.5 for 12 days, B. thuringiensis BRB-3 achieved a high GABA yield of 25.06 g/L (242.9 mM). Therefore, B. thuringiensis BRB-3 demonstrated significant potential for GABA production and could be utilized in various functional food products, including germinated rice seeds.",Wannasutta R; Boonlue S; Riddech N; Mongkolthanaruk W,Heliyon,2025,10.1016/j.heliyon.2025.e41884,0.962274364098553,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.958857076667196,0.0411429233328041,0.999987912668284,1.2087331715871e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18748,"Development of a translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF) based TaqMan qPCR assay for Diaporthe humulicola, the causal agent of halo blight of hop.","Halo blight of hop, caused by Diaporthe humulicola, was first described in 2018 and is a major concern for growers in the eastern United States and Canada. This pathogen can cause quality and yield losses by desiccating hop cones, leading to shatter. However, traditional disease diagnosis is time-consuming, with morphological features taking up to 30 days to develop in culture. To address this issue, a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay based on the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF) gene was developed. We assessed capabilities and limitations of this assay for detection of D. humulicola in plant tissue and investigated aspects of the disease through: (1) testing of hop rhizomes for the presence of fungal pathogens; (2) determining the time required to detect D. humulicola in detached hop leaves; and (3) comparing plating methods with the qPCR assay to monitor D. humulicola in a hop yard. The limit of detection for the assay was 100 fg/µl of DNA. The assay showed no cross-reactivity with other hop pathogens, endophytes, or other Diaporthe species tested. Detection of D. humulicola occurred one day after inoculation. The assay detected D. humulicola in both asymptomatic and symptomatic rhizome tissue, but further investigation is required to determine the cause of the observed symptoms. The assay successfully detected the pathogen in individual hop cones and inflorescences throughout the season, with higher positive identification rates than culture-based assays. This assay will provide time-limited diagnosticians a tool for detection of D. humulicola.",Hatlen RJ; Szymanski S; Adair N; Fan Q; Panwar P; Sysak R; Miles LA; Higgins D; Rojas JA; Gent DH; Miles TD,Plant disease,2025,10.1094/PDIS-11-24-2331-SR,0.909496792664865,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.766505447188076,0.233494552811924,0.999975064717617,2.49352823830096e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
10945,Evaluation of phytotoxic potential and identification of phytotoxic compounds in Rumex maritimus,"Rumex maritimus (Polygonaceae) is an annual herb and is well known for its use in medicinal treatments. Although the pharmacological properties of R. maritimus are well documented, no phytotoxic activity of R. maritimus has yet been found.

Inhibitory activity was found in aqueous methanol extracts of R. maritimus on the seedling growth of cress, rapeseed, barnyard grass, and foxtail fescue, in which inhibition increased with increasing extract concentration. Two compounds were isolated using chromatography, and using spectroscopy their structure was determined as 5,7-dihydroxyphthalide and altechromone A. 5,7-Dihydroxyphthalide significantly inhibited cress seedling growth by 27.2-43.0% of control seedlings at 3mM, whereas altechromone A inhibited seedling growth by 65.4-66.3% at 0.01mM. The concentrations required for 50% inhibition of cress seedling growth were 1.73-2.48mM for 5,7-dihydroxyphthalide and 0.66-1.41mM for altechromone A.

18743,Genetic Blueprint for Stringent Response in Betaproteobacterial Aromatoleum/Azoarcus/Thauera Cluster.,"The Aromatoleum/Azoarcus/Thauera (AAT) cluster comprises anaerobic degradation specialists (Aromatoleum, Thauera) and N2-fixing endophytes (Azoarcus). Omics-based and genetic studies with associated model strains implicate stringent response (SR) in adaptation to nutrient limitation and plant colonization. SR is well-studied in standard bacteria such as Escherichia coli and known as adaptive strategy to nutrient limitations by adjusting e.g., transcription and stress response. SR involves the alarmone (p)ppGpp, whose cellular level is controlled by the synthetases/hydrolases RelA/SpoT and the noncanonical transcription factor DksA, whose interaction with RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding of (p)ppGpp enhances. DksA-mediated SR occurs across Proteobacteria and other phylogenetic groups such as Myxococcia and Spirochaetia, mostly applying to pathogens. Furthermore, all three DksA variants (four, two or one cysteine residue(s) for Zn2+-binding) were found. Genes encoding SR components are present in all studied 37 genomes representing 31 species from the AAT cluster. Each genome encodes a synthesizing RelA, a hydrolyzing SpoT, a four cysteine-containing DksA, and mostly also a one cysteine-containing DksA. Opposing functions of RelA and SpoT in Aromatoleum aromaticum EbN1T, Aromatoleum sp. strain CIB, Azoarcus olearius BH72, and Thauera aromatica K172T (also entire AAT cluster) are implicated by full conservation of amino acids (E and D vs. 2H2D motif and ED diad) essential for catalysis by their synthetase versus hydrolase domains. Likewise, functionality of the predicted C4-type DksAs from these four model strains was visually assessed by structural modeling and comparison of key features (binding sites for Zn2+/(p)ppGpp; CC tip for RNAP interaction) to those of the available E. coli DksA cryo-EM structure. SR as a global adaptation strategy should contribute to the success of the AAT cluster in its distinct habitats: complex and highly variable soils/sediments (high molecular and microbial diversity, fluctuating nutrient availabilities and redox states) of the free-living degradation specialists versus the defined endorhizosphere (more stable conditions, less complex community) of the endophytes. A noteworthy exception is Aromatoleum sp. strain CIB by combining degradation and endophytic features. Thus, future investigations into the role of SR in the habitat success of such bacteria reflecting their divergent environmental niches are needed as well as promising.",Becker P; Ruickoldt J; Wendler P; Reinhold-Hurek B; Rabus R,Microbial physiology,2025,10.1159/000546200,0.827165695949433,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.774960931366196,0.225039068633804,0.999999831962473,1.68037526893094e-7,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
9826,Drivers of Foliar Fungal Endophytic Communities of Kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata) in the Southeast United States,"Fungal endophytes play important roles in plant fitness and plant-microbe interactions. Kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata) is a dominant, abundant, and highly aggressive invasive plant in the Southeast United States. Kudzu serves as a pathogen reservoir that impacts economically important leguminous crops. We conducted the first investigations on kudzu fungal endophytes (Illumina MiSeq-ITS2) to elucidate drivers of endophytic communities across the heart of the invasive range in the Southeast United States (TN, MS, AL, GA). We tested the impacts of multiple environmental parameters (Chlorophyll, NO3-, K+, soil pH, leaf area, host genotype, traffic intensity, and geographic location) on foliar endophyte communities. Endophytic communities were diverse and structured by many factors in our PerMANOVA analyses, but location, genotype, and traffic (proxy for pollution) were the strongest drivers of community composition (R-2 = 0.152, p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.129, p < 0.001, and R-2 = 0.126, p < 0.001, respectively). Further, we examined the putative ecological interactions between endophytic fungi and plant pathogens. We identify numerous OTUs that are positively and strongly associated with pathogen occurrence, largely within the families Montagnulaceae and Tremellales incertae sedis. Taken together, these data suggest location, host genetics and local pollution play instrumental roles in structuring communities, and integrative plant management must consider these factors when developing management strategies.","Shahrtash, M; Brown, SP",DIVERSITY-BASEL,2020,10.3390/d12050185,0.79205699655224,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999202398705911,7.9760129408928e-4,0.999999998871438,1.12856191059052e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
11738,Differences in fungal communities associated to Festuca paniculata roots in subalpine grasslands,"Mycorrhizal fungi or endphytes colonize plant roots and their occurrence and composition depend on biotic and abiotic characteristics of the ecosystem. We investigated the composition of these microbial communities associated with Festuca paniculata, a slow growing species, which dramatically impacts functional plant diversity and the recycling of organic matter in subalpine grasslands. F. paniculata individuals from both mown and unmown grasslands were randomly collected and the microscopic observation of the plant roots revealed a difference in fungal colonization according to management. The ITS regions of root-associated fungi were amplified, cloned and sequenced. Bioinformatic analysis revealed a total of 43 and 35 phylotypes in mown and unmown grasslands respectively, highlighting a remarkable difference in the composition between both fungal communities. The phylotypes were assigned to 9 classes in which two classes Eurotiomycetes and Lecanoromycetes were specific to mown grasslands, while Tremellomycetes were specific to unmown grasslands and only five phylotypes were common to both locations. The comparative analysis of fungal lifestyles indicated the dominance of saprobes and a large proportion of endophytes compared to the mycorrhizal fungi (7/1 and 11/2 phylotypes in mown and unmown grasslands, respectively). Endophyte richness was greater in the unmown gassland than in the mown grassland and their relative proportion was twice higher. Our results suggest that endophytes may offer potential resources to F. paniculata and play an important role in the regulation of plant diversity.","Mouhamadou, B; Molitor, C; Baptist, F; Sage, L; Clément, JC; Lavorel, S; Monier, A; Geremia, RA",FUNGAL DIVERSITY,2011,10.1007/s13225-011-0091-3,0.95902169491842,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99127040723545,0.00872959276454972,0.999924481252004,7.55187479963837e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
9652,EFFECT OF SEED TREATMENT AND FERTILIZER COATED WITH FLUTRIAFOL ON BLACKLEG OF CANOLA (OILSEED RAPE) IN WESTERN CANADA,"The systemic fungicide flutriafol coated on fertilizers at various dosages and applied as a seed treatment was evaluated against blackleg disease [Leptosphaeria maculans] of spring canola (Brassica napus and B. rapa) in extensive field trials in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Marginal and variable control of the disease was obtained. Analyses with gas chromatography for flutriafol residues in plant materials from field trials indicated that the fungicide was taken up and was present in canola plants throughout the growing season. The highest quantities were detected in plants from a coated mono-calcium phosphate treatment. Isolations made from samples of plant material collected in field trials showed that the fungicide treatments had limited effects on infection early in the season. There is no definite answer as to why blackleg has been successfully controlled with flutriafol-coated fertilizer in Australia, but not in western Canada. Soil types and pH in the optimum range for agricultural practice did not have major effects on the efficacy of the treatments. The interaction of the pathogen and the host in relation to fungicide uptake under particular environmental conditions may play a key role in affecting the disease.","XI, K; KUTCHER, HR; WESTCOTT, ND; MORRALL, RAA; RIMMER, SR",CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE PHYTOPATHOLOGIE,1991,10.1080/07060669109500919,0.89227820048458,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98996291865814,0.0100370813418603,0.999953990192776,4.60098072240234e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5527,"Multi-Gene Phylogeny and Taxonomy of Hypoxylon (Hypoxylaceae, Ascomycota) from China","The Hypoxylon species play an important ecological role in tropical rainforest as wood-decomposers, and some might have benefical effects on their hosts as endophytes. The present work concerns a survey of the genus Hypoxylon from Hainan Tropical Rainforest National Park of China. Four new species: H. wuzhishanense, H. hainanense, H. chrysalidosporum, and H. cyclobalanopsidis, were discovered based on a combination of morphological characteristics and molecular data. Hypoxylon wuzhishanense is characterized by Rust pulvinate stromata, amyloid apical apparatus and brown ascospores, with most of the perispore being indehiscent in 10% KOH. Hypoxylon hainanense has effused-pulvinate and Violet stromata, amyloid apical apparatus, light-brown to brown ascospores with straight germ slit and dehiscent perispore. Hypoxylon chrysalidosporum is distinguished by glomerate to pulvinate stromata, highly reduced or absent inamyloid apical apparatus, and light-brown to brown ascospores with very conspicuous coil-like ornamentation. Hypoxylon cyclobalanopsidis has Livid Purple pulvinate stromata, highly reduced amyloid apical apparatus, faint bluing, brown ascospores and dehiscent perispore, and it grows on dead branches of Cyclobalanopsis. Detailed descriptions, illustrations, and contrasts with morphologically similar species are provided. Phylogenetic analyses inferred from ITS, RPB2, LSU, and beta-tubulin sequences confirmed that the four new species are distinct within the genus Hypoxylon.","Ma, HX; Song, ZK; Pan, XY; Li, Y; Yang, ZE; Qu, Z",DIVERSITY-BASEL,2022,10.3390/d14010037,0.850428508707803,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999598383889507,4.0161611049309e-4,0.999999970332221,2.96677792333e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

4912,Multi-approach analysis of the diversity in Colletotrichum cliviae sensu lato,"Colletotrichum cliviae is a fungal species reported both as pathogen and endophyte with broad geographical distribution. Some purported isolates of this species have been assigned to different taxa, including Colletotrichum aracearum, Colletotrichum orchidearum and Colletotrichum. sichuanensis, for which a preliminary analysis of extensive multilocus (ACT, GAPDH, ITS, TUB2) data in this study revealed high sequence similarity with C. cliviae. We further reassessed the species delineation by using the coalescent method of the generalized mixed Yule-coalescent (GMYC) and Poisson Tree Processes (PTP). Single and multilocus gene trees strongly supported a C. cliviae s. lat. clade including the four species. This clade unfolded eight subclades grouped into three distinct lineages, but no monophyly of any of the four species. GMYC and PTP analyses confidently supported the evolutionary independence of these lineages. C. sichuanensis and C. cliviae, except one isolate, formed the largest lineage. The second lineage was made up of isolates named C. aracearum and some of C. orchidearum sharing the haplotype and the third lineage accommodated two isolates named C. cliviae and C. orchidearum. This finding suggests the synonymization of C. sichuanensis with C. cliviae whereas the taxonomic status of C. aracearum and C. orchidearum still needs clarification. This study lays great stress upon the use of comprehensive data for sequence-based characterisation of species in the C. cliviae s. lat.

3035,Genotypic variation in Norway spruce correlates to fungal communities in vegetative buds,"The taxonomically diverse phyllosphere fungi inhabit leaves of plants. Thus, apart from the fungi's dispersal capacities and environmental factors, the assembly of the phyllosphere community associated with a given host plant depends on factors encoded by the host's genome. The host genetic factors and their influence on the assembly of phyllosphere communities under natural conditions are poorly understood, especially in trees. Recent work indicates that Norway spruce (Picea abies) vegetative buds harbour active fungal communities, but these are hitherto largely uncharacterized. This study combines internal transcribed spacer sequencing of the fungal communities associated with dormant vegetative buds with a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 478 unrelated Norway spruce trees. The aim was to detect host loci associated with variation in the fungal communities across the population, and to identify loci correlating with the presence of specific, latent, pathogens. The fungal communities were dominated by known Norway spruce phyllosphere endophytes and pathogens. We identified six quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with the relative abundance of the dominating taxa (i.e., top 1% most abundant taxa). Three additional QTLs associated with colonization by the spruce needle cast pathogen Lirula macrospora or the cherry spruce rust (Thekopsora areolata) in asymptomatic tissues were detected. The identification of the nine QTLs shows that the genetic variation in Norway spruce influences the fungal community in dormant buds and that mechanisms underlying the assembly of the communities and the colonization of latent pathogens in trees may be uncovered by combining molecular identification of fungi with GWAS.","Elfstrand, M; Zhou, LH; Baison, J; Olson, Å; Lundén, K; Karlsson, B; Wu, HX; Stenlid, J; García-Gil, MR",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2020,10.1111/mec.15314,0.877208892107549,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999562667428176,4.3733257182415e-4,0.99999996235711,3.76428902493231e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Prosopis laevigata is a hyperaccumulator legume that bioaccumulates Pb, Cu and Zn. With interest in designing phytoremediation strategies for sites contaminated with heavy metals, we isolated and characterized endophytic fungi from the roots of P. laevigata growing on mine tailings located in Morelos, Mexico. Ten endophytic isolates were selected by morphological discrimination and a preliminary minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for zinc, lead and copper. A novel strain of Aspergillus closest to Aspergillus luchuensis was determined to be a metallophile and presented a marked tolerance to high concentrations of Cu, Zn and Pb, so it was further investigated for removal of metals and promotion of plant growth under greenhouse conditions. The control substrate with fungi promoted larger size characters in P. laevigata individuals in comparison with the other treatments, demonstrating that A. luchuensis strain C7 is a growth-promoting agent for P. laevigata individuals. The fungus favors the translocation of metals from roots to leaves in P. laevigata, promoting an increased Cu translocation. This new A. luchuensis strain showed endophytic character and plant growth-promotion activity, high metal tolerance, and an ability to increase copper translocation. We propose it as a novel, effective and sustainable bioremediation strategy for copper-polluted soils.","Tovar-Sánchez, E; Concepción-Acosta, CM; Sánchez-Reyes, A; Sánchez-Cruz, R; Folch-Mallol, JL; Mussali-Galante, P",PLANTS-BASEL,2023,10.3390/plants12061338,0.909977139624001,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.884092665939453,0.115907334060547,0.999999348435155,6.51564845299824e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

3609,Microbial communities in crop phyllosphere and root endosphere are more resistant than soil microbiota to fertilization,"Crop harbors diverse microbial communities that profoundly influence host health and agricultural productivity. Crop habitat is a dynamic and heterogeneous environment, and thus crop microbiota may display spatial organization across different compartments. However, impacts of long-term fertilization, as a common agricultural practice, on the assembly of crop microbiota and their relationships with crop yield and quality remain largely unresolved. Here, we collected sorghum roots and leaves, and rhizosphere and bulk soils, from an eight-year field experiment with multiple fertilization regimes, and characterized sorghum-associated microbiomes by amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS region. Rhizosphere and bulk soils harbored significantly higher diversity of bacteria and fungi than phyllosphere and root endophytes, and the microbial community composition significantly differed across the four compartments. Fertilization significantly influenced the diversity and compositions of sorghum-associated microbial communities, but had more pronounced effects on rhizosphere and bulk soil microbiomes through altering the relative abundances of some major microbial bio-markers. Bacterial genera Lysobacter, Acidibacter, Steroidobacter, RB41, and Blastococcus, and fungal genera Fusarium and Guehomyces were the dominant microbial predictors of sorghum yield and protein content. Structural equation models revealed that fertilization had a positive and indirect effect on sorghum yield and protein content through influencing the microbial diversity in rhizosphere and bulk soils. We provide novel evidence that microbial communities in sorghum phyllosphere and root endosphere are more resistant than soil microbiota to long-term fertilization, and soil microbiota are important predictors of sorghum yield and protein content.","Sun, AQ; Jiao, XY; Chen, QL; Wu, AL; Zheng, Y; Lin, YX; He, JZ; Hu, HW",SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,2021,10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.108113,0.980749021847594,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999808777724008,1.9122227599229e-4,0.99999999999775,2.25042207091519e-12,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

9910,Fungal endophytic communities associated to the phyllosphere of grapevine cultivars under different types of management,"Fungal endophytes present in different asymptomatic grapevine plants (Vitis vinifera L.) located in different vineyards within Alentejo, a highly important viticulture region in Portugal, were identified in this study. Sampled grapevine plants included the three most representative cultivars in the region, Syrah, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Aragonez, growing under two different modes of management, conventional and biological. Sixteen fungal taxa were identified through sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region. Total number of endophytic fungi isolated showed significant differences both in management mode and in cultivars, with higher numbers in grapevines under conventional mode and from Syrah cultivar. The composition of fungal endophytic communities did not show significant differences among cultivars, but differences were observed between fungal communities isolated from grapevines under biological or conventional modes. The most fungal taxa isolated from grapevines cultivated under biological mode were Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium sp., and Nigrospora oryzae, and under conventional mode Botrytis cinerea, Epicoccum nigrum, and Epicoccum sp. These differences suggest that the different products used in grapevine production have impacts in fungal endophytic composition.

11136,Resistance to triadimefon and benomyl: Dynamics and impact on managing cucurbit powdery mildew,"Frequency of fungicide-resistant strains of Podosphaera xanthii on pumpkins in New York before treatment varied from 3 to 80% for the demethylation inhibiting (DMI) fungicide triadimefon and from 0 to 48% for the benzimidazole fungicide benomyl between 1993 and 1996. When the initial frequency of triadimefon-resistant strains was less than 55%, one application of triadimefon plus chlorothalonil was effective. This application was made after reaching the action threshold of one leaf with powdery mildew symptoms per 50 old leaves (defined as the oldest third of the foliage). The frequency of triadimefon-resistant strains increased from 3 to 71% by 20 days after the first fungicide application in 1993. Triadimefon in the second application did not contribute to control. Loss of efficacy was due to resistance because, compared with triadimefon-treated pumpkins, pumpkins treated with other systemic fungicides were less severely infected by powdery mildew on abaxial leaf surfaces where the companion multi-site contact fungicide contributes little to control. Triadimefon was not effective in 1995 when 80% of the pathogen population was resistant before treatment. Benomyl was effective in 1995, but not in 1996 when 48% of the isolates tested were resistant to both benomyl and triadimefon before treatment. An in-field seedling assay was developed to determine local occurrence of resistant strains before the first treatment was needed. Although sensitivity of the pathogen population to the DMI fungicides myclobutanil and propiconazole also decreased after they were applied, these fungicides were more effective than triadimefon.","McGrath, MT; Shishkoff, N",PLANT DISEASE,2001,10.1094/PDIS.2001.85.2.147,0.881489840232616,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.797445556270847,0.202554443729153,0.999999511303005,4.8869699542653e-7,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
19620,"General Limitations to Endophytic Entomopathogenic Fungi Use as Plant Growth Promoters, Pests and Pathogens Biocontrol Agents.","The multiple roles of fungal entomopathogens in host plants' growth promotion, pest and pathogen management have drawn huge attention for investigation. Endophytic species are known to influence various activities of their associated host plants, and the endophyte-colonized plants have been demonstrated to gain huge benefits from these symbiotic associations. The potential application of fungal endophytes as alternative to inorganic fertilizers for crop improvement has often been proposed. Similarly, various strains of insect pathogenic fungi have been formulated for use as mycopesticides and have been suggested as long-term replacement for the synthetic pesticides that are commonly in use. The numerous concerns about the negative effects of synthetic chemical pesticides have also driven attention towards developing eco-friendly pest management techniques. However, several factors have been underlined to be militating the successful adoption of entomopathogenic fungi and fungal endophytes as plant promoting, pests and diseases control bio-agents. The difficulties in isolation and characterization of novel strains, negative effects of geographical location, vegetation type and human disturbance on fungal entomopathogens, are among the numerous setbacks that have been documented. Although, the latest advances in biotechnology and microbial studies have provided means of overcoming many of these problems. For instance, studies have suggested measures for mitigating the negative effects of biotic and abiotic stressors on entomopathogenic fungi in inundative application on the field, or when applied in the form of fungal endophytes. In spite of these efforts, more studies are needed to be done to achieve the goal of improving the overall effectiveness and increase in the level of acceptance of entomopathogenic fungi and their products as an integral part of the integrated pest management programs, as well as potential adoption as an alternative to inorganic fertilizers and pesticides.",Bamisile BS; Siddiqui JA; Akutse KS; Ramos Aguila LC; Xu Y,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,10.3390/plants10102119,0.996216147435534,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.978819117964916,0.0211808820350841,0.999996068017573,3.93198242654158e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Plants were either symptomless or showed signs of infection in the shape of limited lesions which sometimes contained melanized pycnidial initials. Rapid colonization of host tissue and sporulation were observed within 9 d on dead plant material upon incubation in a moist chamber. Such colonized material, but not freshly harvested living tissue, contained brefeldin A (1.7 mug g(-1) D.w.). This toxin was also produced in pure culture (20 mg I-1) and in artificially inoculated autoclaved M. sativa stems (3 mg g(-1) D.W. =920 mug ml(-1)). The latter concentration of brefeldin A should be similar to that produced within a fruiting lesion of P. medicaginis and suppressed spore germination and growth of nine of 11 common phylloplane fungi tested.

2667,Short-Term Effects of Different Organic Amendments on Soil Fungal Composition,"Fungi play an essential role in recovering the quality and fertility of soil. There is a limited understating of the complex response of fungal diversity to different organic materials in clay loam soil. Here, we report the response of soil fungi toward the short-term application of manure (M), sugarcane straw (S), and sugarcane straw plus manure (MS), including no organic material control (CK) at two different time points (50 and 100 days after application). Illumina sequencing was used to examine the fungal communities. Our results reveal a significant shift among the soil fungal community structure associated with each organic material application. After both time points, amendments-especially M and MS-decreased the fungal richness and stimulated the copiotrophic fungal group (Ascomycota) compared to the control soil (CK) and S-amended soil. On the contrary, as compared to the M and MS-amended soils, the CK and S-amended soils at both time points increased the fungal richness and stimulated the oligotrophic fungal groups. Organic material use, especially M and MS, showed variable results regarding pathogenic fungi enhancing the abundance of Lophodermium and Cercophora and decreasing Fusarium. Concerning the abundance of plant-beneficial fungi, Mortierella was reduced, and Podospora was increased by M and MS input. FUNGuild showed that the amendment of organic materials efficiently declined the abundance of endophytes and plant pathogens, but also enhanced the animal pathogens in terms of abundance with respect to CK at two time points. This study could be useful to provide a novel understanding of the management of soil-borne pathogens by organic amendments for the sustainable production of short-term crops.","Tayyab, M; Islam, W; Lee, CG; Pang, ZQ; Khalil, F; Lin, S; Lin, WX; Zhang, H",SUSTAINABILITY,2019,10.3390/su11010198,0.964138270826355,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994940239003762,0.00505976099623799,0.999999999778075,2.21925255949884e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Endophyte-free ryegrass areas were also undersown with endophyte-free seed in March and April of the second and third years, respectively.

Ergovaline herbage concentrations rarely exceeded 1 mu g g(-1) DM and were highest (1.6 mu g g(-1) DM) in high-endophyte ryegrass pastures at the start of the third summer (December 1995), probably because of a high seed-head content (30% of DM).

12517,High Diversity of Epicoccum Species Associated with Leaf Spot on Italian Ryegrass in Southwestern China: Six New Records and Three New Species,"Italian ryegrass is widely cultivated for the production of forage, hay, and silage because of its high nutritional value and good palatability. Leaf spots caused by fungi pose a serious threat to forage crops. In order to expand the knowledge of fungi causing leaf spots in ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) in Sichuan, Yunnan, Chongqing, and Guizhou of southwestern China, a comprehensive survey was undertaken from 2015 to 2022. The survey discovered that Epicoccum leaf spot (ELS) was a common and widespread disease, more serious at the late stage of growth (after late May). Symptomatic leaf samples collected from the four different provinces were analyzed, and a total of 202 Epicoccum isolates were obtained. Based on both multilocus phylogeny (ITS, LSU, TUB2, and RPB2) and morphology, 10 Epicoccum species were finally identified, including three novel species (E. endololii sp. nov., E. lolii sp. nov., and E. loliicola sp. nov.), six new host records (E. draconis, E. endophyticum, E. oryzae, E. plurivorum, E. thailandicum, and E. tobaicum), and an unknown species (Epicoccum sp.1). Pathogenicity tests showed that E. endophyticum, E. endololii, and Epicoccum sp.1 were nonpathogenic to Italian ryegrass, which were confirmed as endophytes in this study; the other six species could infect Italian ryegrass and cause leaf lesions to different degrees, of which E. draconis was more aggressive (P <= 0.05). Coupled with the isolation rates and geographical distributions of these species, it was found that E. plurivorum was the predominant pathogen in Yunnan while E. oryzae and E. tobaicum were the predominant pathogens in the other three provinces. This work provides an initial understanding of the taxonomy, virulence, and distribution of Epicoccum species associated with ELS in southwestern China and lays a solid foundation for the diagnosis in the field and scientific control of ELS on Italian ryegrass.","Xu, ZT; Xu, LL; Liu, JQ; Chen, DY; Cui, HW; Xue, LH; Li, CJ",PLANT DISEASE,2024,10.1094/PDIS-06-23-1044-RE,0.964047878729758,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98601864574541,0.0139813542545903,0.999998180896028,1.81910397190066e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

277,Diversity and antimicrobial activity of endophytic fungi isolated from Securinega suffruticosa in the Yellow River Delta,"Securinega suffruticosa (Pall.) Rehd is an excellent natural secondary shrub in the Shell Islands of Yellow River Delta. The roots of S. suffruticosa have high medicinal value and are used to treat diseases, such as neurasthenia and infant malnutrition. Any organism that is isolated from this species is of immense interest due to its potential novel bioactive compounds. In this research, the distribution and diversity of culturable endophytic fungi in S. suffruticosa were studied, and the endophytic fungi with antimicrobial activity were screened. A total of 420 endophytic fungi isolates were obtained from the S. suffruticosa grown in Shell Islands, from which 20 genera and 35 species were identified through morphological and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analyses. Chaetomium, Fusarium, Cladosporium, and Ceratobasidium were the dominant genera. The high species richness S (42), Margalef index D' (5.6289), Shannon-Wiener index H' (3.1000), Simpson diversity index D-s (0.9459), PIE index (0.8670), and evenness Pielou index J (0.8719) and a low dominant index lambda (0.0541) indicated the high diversity of endophytic fungi in S. suffruticosa, the various species of endophytic fungi with obvious tissue specificity. The inhibition percentages of the 12 species of such endophytic fungi against Colletotrichum siamense were 3.6%-26.3%. C. globosum, Fusarium sp.3, and C. ramotenellum had a high antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and the Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) were between 0.5 mg/mL and 2 mg/mL. Alkaloid content detection indicated that endophytic fungi had a high alkaloid content, whereas the alkaloid contents of C. globosum and Fusarium sp.3 reached 0.231% and 0.170%, respectively.

6864,Report on Vincristine-Producing Endophytic Fungus Nigrospora zimmermanii from Leaves of Catharanthus roseus,"Vincristine is an anti-cancer compound and one of the most crucial vinca alkaloids produced by the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don. (Apocynaceae). This plant is home to hundreds of endophytic microbes, which produce a variety of bioactive secondary metabolites that are known for their medicinal properties. In this study, we focused on isolating an endophytic fungus that could increase the yield of vincristine under laboratory conditions as an alternative to plant-mediated extraction of vincristine. The endophytic fungus Nigrospora zimmermanii (Apiosporaceae) was isolated from Catharanthus roseus and it was found to be producing the anticancer compound vincristine. It was identified using high-performance thin-layer chromatography by matching the Rf value and spectral data with the vincristine standard and mass spectrometry data and the reference molecule from the PubChem database. The generation study of this microbe showed that the production of vincristine in the parent fungus was at its maximum, i.e., 5.344 mu g/mL, while it was slightly reduced in subsequent generations. A colonization study was also performed and it showed that the fungus N. zimmermanii was able to re-infect the plant Catharanthus roseus after 20 days of inoculation. The colonization study showed that N. zimmernanii could infect the plant after isolation. This method is an efficient and easy way to obtain a high yield of vincristine, as compared to plant-mediated production.","Birat, K; Binsuwaidan, R; Siddiqi, TO; Mir, SR; Alshammari, N; Adnan, M; Nazir, R; Ejaz, B; Malik, MQ; Dewangan, RP; Ashraf, SA; Panda, BP",METABOLITES,2022,10.3390/metabo12111119,0.951567395550325,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998510235172892,0.00148976482710789,0.999999999999987,1.27675647831893e-14,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

8645,Assessment of Endophytic Fungal Community in Palm Leaves and Their Biocontrol Potential,"Microbial endophytes live asymptomatically within a host plant and contribute positively to its fitness. Endophytes associate ubiquitously with all plants examined so far and form an integral part of the host for processes such as nutrient uptake and stress response and traits like disease resistance. Well-characterized host-endophyte interaction models exist, but little is known about the microbiome of the monocot plant host, palm. In this study, we identified the endophytic fungal community associated with mule palm leaves with an objective to test their antagonist effects on lethal pathogens of palms. The leaflets of mule palms were sampled across five sites in Central and South Florida, and fungal endophytes were identified using culture-dependent (CD) and amplicon sequence-based culture-independent (CI) methods. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) corresponding to phylum Ascomycota were identified by both approaches, whereas Basidiomycota were only detected using the CI method. Among the ascomycetes, a small (22%) overlap in the OTUs at the genus level was observed between the two methods, whereas the majority (64%) of OTUs were detected using the CI approach. In vitro cocultivation of endophytes with palm pathogens was observed to produce three distinct interaction phenotypes: inhibition zone, niche establishment, and overlapping growth. Eight endophytes capable of inhibiting fungal pathogen growth in vitro were also identified, suggesting a biocontrol potential for endophyte-derived secondary metabolites. A better understanding of the composition, assembly, and ecology of palm-associated microbial communities would eventually lead to healthy and resilient palms.Copyright (c) 2024 The Author(s).

13515,Tasco-Forage: I. Influence of a seaweed extract on antioxidant activity in tall fescue and in ruminants,"Seaweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) is a known source of plant growth regulators, and application to turfgrasses has increased activity of the antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) and specific vitamin precursors. Increased antioxidant activity in both plants and animals diminishes oxidative stress. Two pasture experiments investigated effects of Tasco-Forage (a proprietary seaweed-based product) applied to tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea) on antioxidant activity in plants and in ruminants that grazed the forage. In Exp. 1, fescue was 70 to 100% infected with the endophyte fungus Neotyphodium coenophialum ([Morgan-Jones and Gams] Glenn, Bacon, and Hanlin). Twenty-four wether lambs (initial BW 41 kg; SD = 5) grazed fescue treated with 0, 1.7, or 3.4 kg Tasco/ha applied in April and July, 1994, with four replications per treatment. Grazing occurred for 26 d beginning April 21 and for 22 d beginning July 19. In July, there was a linear increase in daily gains (P < 0.05), and serum vitamin A (P < 0.13) and whole-blood Se (P < 0.10) tended to increase in lambs grazing Tasco-treated fescue. In Exp. 2,48 Angus and Angus x Hereford steers (initial BW 245 kg; SD = 20) grazed infected or uninfected tall fescue in Virginia that was treated (3.4 kg/ ha) or untreated with Tasco in April and July, 1995. Steers that grazed infected tall fescue had lower (P < 0.02) serum vitamin A and E and tended (P < 0.07) to have lower whole-blood Se in September compared with steers that grazed uninfected tall fescue. Tasco decreased (P < 0.06) serum vitamin E but tended to increase whole-blood Se (P < 0.10) in September and serum vitamin A in July (P < 0.12). During 1996 and 1997, the experiment was repeated in Virginia with Angus steers and was replicated at Prairie, MS, where 1/4 Brahman x 3/4 Angus steers were used. Forty-eight steers were included at each location in each year (n = 192 total steers for 1996 and 1997). Steers that grazed infected tall fescue in Mississippi had lower (P < 0.05) serum vitamin E by the end of the grazing season. At both locations Tasco increased (P < 0.05) activity of superoxide dismutase in both infected and uninfected fescue. The endophyte in tall fescue seemed to decrease antioxidant activity in grazing steers, whereas Tasco seemed to increase antioxidant activity in both the forage and the grazing ruminant.

2141,Forest and Plantation Soil Microbiomes Differ in Their Capacity to Suppress Feedback Between Geosmithia morbida and Rhizosphere Pathogens of Juglans nigra Seedlings,"Thousand cankers disease (TCD) is hypothesized to have a greater impact on eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) in urban forests and plantations compared with natural forest stands. Along with other factors such as resource availability, the phytobiome could partly account for observed differences in disease severity across management regimes. We investigated the extent to which J. nigra-associated soil microbiomes from plantations and natural forests modulate (i) the amount of necrosis caused by Geosmithia morbida in 1-year-old seedlings, and (ii) relative abundance of rhizosphere endophytes and opportunistic pathogens Fusarium and Rhizoctonia in response to aboveground inoculation with G. morbida. Our results suggest that the microbiome from natural forest soil in central Indiana suppresses Fusarium spp. and is indirectly suppressive of G. morbida. Natural forest soil had a greater ability to reduce the size of necrotic area caused by G. morbida compared with steam-treated soil. Inoculating stems of seedlings with G. morbida induced a shift in fungal community composition in the rhizosphere, including Fusarium and Rhizoctonia spp.; however, the direction and magnitude of the shift depended on whether seedlings were amended with forest, plantation, or steam-treated soil. In a companion experiment, necrotic area in G. morbida-inoculated seedlings was twice as high in seedlings grown from seeds that were treated with Fusarium solani relative to those grown from seed treated with water. Our findings support the hypothesis that TCD seventy can be modulated by host-mediated feedback between above- and belowground pathogens, as well as by microbial interactions in the rhizosphere.","Williams, GM; Ginzel, MD",PHYTOBIOMES JOURNAL,2022,10.1094/PBIOMES-02-21-0014-R,0.991923153194745,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996398663741992,0.00360133625800784,0.999999999907228,9.277245638372729e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
928,"Inference in incidence, infection, and impact: Co-infection of multiple hosts by multiple pathogens","A large literature concerns the epidemiology of single pathogens on single hosts. Yet in some environmental applications,such as fungal pathogens of forest tree seedlings,the ""one host-one pathogen"" paradigm may not be applicable. Multiple potential pathogens are often found in a single individual and/or multiple hosts share the same pathogens. Understanding diversity requires techniques to infer how multiple pathogens might regulate multiple hosts and to predict how imp acts might vary with the environment. Here we present a hierarchical framework for the case where there is detection information based on multiple sources(cultures, gene sequencing,and survival observations),and the inference problem includes not only parameters that describe environmental influences on pathogen incidence infection, and host survival, but also on latent states themselves-pathogen incidence at a site and infection statuses of hosts. Due to the large size of the model space, we develop a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to select models, estimate posterior distributions, and predict environmental influences on host survival. we demonstrate with application to a data set involving fungal pathogens on tree hosts,where data include host survival and fungal detection using cultures and DNA sequencing.","Clark, JS; Hersh, MH",BAYESIAN ANALYSIS,2009,10.1214/09-BA413,0.992397483632286,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998531962105262,0.00146803789473813,0.999999991065381,8.93461860052014e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

4021,"ENDOPHYTIC LEPTOSTROMA SPECIES ON PICEA-ABIES, ABIES-ALBA, AND ABIES-BALSAMEA - A CULTURAL, BIOCHEMICAL, AND NUMERICAL STUDY","Growth on different media, substrate utilization patterns, water-soluble protein electrophoretic profiles, as well as pectinase and amylase multilocus enzyme analyses were used to characterize thirty-seven endophytic strains of Leptostroma isolated from needles of Picea abies, Abies alba, and A. balsamea. Among substrate utilization tests, only proteolytic activity, almost absent in the spruce isolates but usually present in the others, could be used for characterization of strains. All isolates tested positive for the Bavendamm reaction and were able to utilize soluble starch and cellulose. Electrophoresis of water soluble proteins provided a reliable method to distinguish isolates from different hosts because electromorphs were host-specific. Electrophoresis of pectic enzymes allowed a more accurate differentiation of strains within host, but, on the whole, host-specificity of electromorphs was confirmed. Amylolytic activity was absent in ca 50% of the strains tested and the same electromorph was shared by roughly 80% of the remaining isolates. The results of this study support the hypothesis that distinct species of Leptostroma, which are morphologically almost indistinguishable from each other, colonize apparently healthy needles of A. alba, A. balsamea, and P. abies.

7645,Isolation and Characterization of Antibacterial Compounds from Aspergillus fumigatus: An Endophytic Fungus from a Mangrove Plant of the Sundarbans,"The Sundarbans, a UNESCO world heritage site, is one of the largest mangrove forests in one stretch. Mangrove plants from this forest are little studied for their endophytic fungi. In this study, we isolated fourteen endophytic fungi from the plants Ceriops decandra and Avicennia officinalis collected from the Sundarbans. Five of them were identified as Aspergillus sp. and one as Penicillium sp. by macroscopic and microscopic observation. Antibacterial activity of the crude extracts obtained from these endophytes was determined against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using resazurin-based microtiter assay. The isolated endophytes showed varying degrees of antibacterial activity with MICs ranging between 5 and 0.078 mg/mL. Molecular identification of the most active endophyte revealed its identity as Aspergillus fumigatus obtained from the leaves of C. decandra. Acute toxicity study of the ethyl acetate extract of A. fumigatus in mice revealed no mortality even at the highest dose of 2000 mg/kg bodyweight, though some opposing results are found in the subacute toxicity study. The extract was subjected to silica gel and Sephadex column chromatography resulting in the isolation of three pure compounds. LC-MS analysis of these pure compounds revealed their identity as fumigaclavine C, azaspirofuran B, and fraxetin. This is the first report of fraxetin from A. fumigatus.

Therefore, the observed antibacterial activity of the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract of A. fumigatus could be due to the presence of these compounds.

15229,Plant Seedling Growth Stimulation and Antifungal Activities of Volatile Organic Compounds Emitted by Aspergillus flavus Endophyte,"Introduction: Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) produced by Plant Growth Promoting fungi (PGPF) have recently been investigated due to their role in plant growth promotion and defense. Whereas many VOCs produced by PGPF promote seed growth. It is known that VOCs, among several other mechanisms, are responsible for the antagonistic activity produced by microorganisms. In this study, we focused on a comparative study between the VOCs emitted by the endophyte A. flavus AFEG-2017 and its host plant (Eleocharis geniculata) and the role of these VOCs in the growth promotion and biological control of some economic plants. Materials and Methods: VOCs from AFEG-2017 and E. geniculata were extracted using ethyl acetate. Then, the analysis of emitted VOCs was accomplished by using gas chromatography mass (GC-MS). Seedling stimulation assay was investigated on seeds of Trigonella foenum-graecum, Solanum lycopersicum, Portulaca oleracea, and Lepidium sativum. In addition, the antifungal activity of VOCs was evaluated against some plant pathogenic fungi. Results: The GC-MS analysis of the volatile emitted from A. flavus (AFEG-2017) resulted in 25 organic and bioactive compounds; of them 2-(2-hydroxy-3-isobutoxypropyl) pent-4-enoic acid, hydrazide was the most abundant compound. The findings of the present study advocate that linalool, linalyl acetate, geranyl acetate, oleic acid, 1-eicosanol, and 1-chloro-octadecane are suitable as biocontrol agents against phytopathogenic fungi. In addition, the volatiles of Euphorbia geniculata showed 28 bioactive compounds, in which Phytol was the most abundant one. The VOCs produced by AFEG-2017 enhanced the seedling growth of T. foenum-graecum, S. lycopersicum, P. oleracea, and L. sativum. Also, VOCS showed inhibition in the tested pathogenic fungi growth like Fusarium oxysporum which showed the highest inhibition percentage in the growth (40%). Conclusions: This study proved that there is a harmony between VOCs produced by the medicinal plant E. geniculata and its endophyte A. flavus. These volatiles could successfully accelerate plant seeding and limit the growth of some important phytopathogens. © 2022 The Author(s).",Abdel-Motaal F.F.; Kamel N.M.; El-Zayat S.A.; Mohamed A.E.-H.H.; Darwish D.B.,Journal of Applied Biotechnology Reports,2022,10.30491/JABR.2022.335430.1514,0.739800385389924,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997287057358239,0.00271294264176125,0.999999995514124,4.48587567092318e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
9620,Increased populations of deleterious fluorescent pseudomonads colonizing rhizomes of leatherleaf fern (Rumohra adiantiformis) and expression of symptoms of fern distortion syndrome after application of Ben late systemic fungicide,"The overall objective of the current study was to test two hypotheses: (1) application of the systemic fungicide Benlate to leatherleaf fern results in long-term increases in populations of deleterious fluorescent pseudomonads that endophytically colonize rhizomes; (2) such endophytic colonization, resulting from Benlate treatment, is associated with damage to leatherleaf fern and development of symptoms of fern distortion syndrome (FDS). Mean populations of fluorescent pseudomonads and total aerobic bacteria in the rhizosphere were significantly increased 3 months after the application of Benlate 50 WP and Benlate 50 DF as foliar sprays and drenches, compared to populations in the non-treated control. In another test, at 5 months after treatment, endophytic populations of fluorescent pseudomonads inside rhizomes of plants treated with Benlate 50 WP and Benlate 50 DF (both from DuPont) were significantly higher than populations in rhizomes of plants treated with three different generic sources of Benlate 50 WP, the active ingredient benomyl, and MBC. In the same test, treatments with the two DuPont sources of Benlate, but not the generic sources, benomyl, or MBC resulted in reduced overall growth of plants, including reductions weight of fronds, roots and rhizomes and caliper of rhizomes. Three long-term experiments examined the effect of Benlate 50 WP and Benlate 50 DF on populations of fluorescent pseudomonads and development of distortions of frond growth and other symptoms associated with FDS. In two tests at 24 months after application, treatment with both formulations of Benlate increased endophytic populations of fluorescent pseudomonads inside rhizomes, compared to controls, in both experiments, and endophytic populations inside petioles of fronds arising from rhizomes were significantly greater with both Benlate treatments in one test where this parameter was measured. Also at 24 months after application, the Benlate treatments were associated with significant increases in severity of FDS, using a previously reported rating scale and by measuring several other parameters associated with FDS. In the third long-term test, the first crop of fronds was cut 24 months after treatment. Four weeks later, the numbers of actively growing rhizomes (that had produced new fronds) were significantly reduced on Benlate-treated plants, compared to the controls. At 6 months after cutting (30 months after Benlate treatments), weights of fronds were lower on Benlate-treated plants than on controls. Characterization of fluorescent pseudomonads isolated from inside rhizomes and petioles at 24 months after treatment revealed that applications of Benlate resulted in a marked increase in pectinolytic activity. DNA sequencing of 150 strains of fluorescent pseudomonads from inside rhizomes and 60 from inside petioles at 24 months after application of Benlate indicated low matches to type strains in the ribosomal data base. Phylogenetic characterization of the strains indicated the existence of 10 clusters. Pronounced shifts in frequency of strains in the various clusters were noted with Benlate treatment: over 70% of strains from rhizomes of Benlate-treated plants belonged to cluster E3, compared to only 2% of the strains from control rhizomes, and 98% of the control strains belonged to clusters C, D2, F. and G, while none of the strains from petioles or rhizomes of Benlate-treated plants belonged to these four clusters. In summary, treatment of leatherleaf fern with Benlate 50 WP and Benlate 50 DF from DuPont led to a progression of long-term deleterious effects on leatherleaf fern that were associated with increased populations of fluorescent pseudomonads that were functionally and phylogenetically different from pseudomonads from control plants.

13161,Endophytic and entomopathogenic strains of Beauveria sp to control the bovine tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus.,"Pathogenicity of strains of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana and endophytic strains of Beauveria sp against the bovine tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus was tested in laboratory bioassays and under field conditions. Suspensions containing 10(5), 10(7) and 10(9) conidia/mL were prepared of each fungal strain for laboratory bioassays. The ticks were maintained at 28 degrees C, 90 +/- 5% relative humidity, and the following variables were evaluated: initial female weight, egg weight, hatching percentage, reproductive efficiency, and percentage control. For tests under field conditions, a Beauveria suspension containing 10(6) conidia/mL was sprayed on tick-infested cows. After 72 h, the ticks were collected to estimate mortality under field conditions. Laboratory bioassays showed a mortality of 20 to 50% of the ticks seven days after inoculation with 10(7) Beauveria conidia/mL. Under field conditions 10(6) Beauveria conidia/mL induced 18-32% mortality. All Beauveria strains were effective in biological control of R. (Boophilus) microplus under laboratory and field test conditions. This is the first demonstration that endophytic fungi can be used for biological control of the cattle tick; this could help reduce environmental contamination by diminishing the need for chemical acaricides. Two endophytic strains were isolated from maize leaves and characterized by molecular sequencing of 5.8S rDNA ITS1 and ITS2 and morphological analyses of conidia.

2861,Performance of the biocontrol fungus Piriformospora indica on wheat under greenhouse and field conditions,"The endophyte Piriformospora indica colonizes roots of a range of host plants and increases biomass production and resistance to fungal pathogens and, thus has been considered a biocontrol fungus. However, the field performance of this fungus has not yet been tested in temperate climates. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of this fungus in different substrata under greenhouse and practical field conditions. Roots of winter wheat were colonized efficiently, and biomass was particularly increased on poor substrata. In greenhouse experiments, symptom severity of a typical leaf (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici), stem base (Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides), and root (Fusarium culmorum) pathogen was reduced significantly. However, in field experiments, symptoms caused by the leaf pathogen did not differ in Piriformospora indica-colonized compared with control plants. In the field, Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides disease severity was significantly reduced in plants colonized by the endophyte. Increased numbers of sheath layers and hydrogen peroxide concentrations after B. graminis attack were detected in Piriformospora indica-colonized plants, suggesting that root colonization causes induction of systemic resistance or priming of the host plant. Although the endophyte is not well suited for growth at Central European temperature conditions, it remains to be shown whether P. indica is more suitable for tropical or subtropical farming.","Serfling, A; Wirsel, SGR; Lind, V; Deising, HB",PHYTOPATHOLOGY,2007,10.1094/PHYTO-97-4-0523,0.955356908416984,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998478366248303,0.00152163375169695,0.999999999678625,3.21375259737522e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
17754,Protection to Tomato Wilt Disease Conferred by the Nonpathogen Fusarium oxysporum Fo47 is More Effective Than that Conferred by Avirulent Strains.,"Although the vascular pathogen Fusarium oxysporum is notorious for being the causal agent of Fusarium wilt disease, the vast majority of F. oxysporum strains are harmless soil and root colonizers. The latter F. oxysporum's are often endophytes colonizing roots intracellularly without negatively affecting plant fitness. Actually, most of them, like Fo47, are beneficial providing biological control to various root pathogens. Interestingly, also pathogenic F. oxysporum inoculated on a resistant host (i.e., avirulent F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici) can reduce susceptibility to virulent F. oxysporum strains via a mechanism called ""cross protection."" It has been hypothesized that cross protection is based on activation of a resistance protein of the host upon recognition of a cognate avirulence (Avr) protein of the pathogen. Currently, it is unknown whether the biocontrol activity of F. oxysporum endophytes utilizes similar mechanisms as cross protection conferred by avirulent pathogens, and whether both provide a quantitative similar level of protection. Here, we show that in tomato biocontrol activity of the Fo47 endophyte to the pathogen F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici is more effective than cross protection induced by avirulent F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici strains activating either I, I-2, or both resistance proteins upon recognition of Avr1 or the Avr2/Six5 pair, respectively. These findings imply that cross protection and biological control utilize different mechanisms to reduce susceptibility of the host to subsequent infections.",de Lamo FJ; Spijkers SB; Takken FLW,Phytopathology,2021,10.1094/PHYTO-04-20-0133-R,0.70300407784713,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.755428506911511,0.244571493088489,0.999965718785546,3.4281214454257e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
15338,Estimation of metabolic activity of cut flowers during a study to enhance vase life of Cymbidium hybrid cut-flowers,"In this study, the metabolic activity (MA) of orchid cut flowers was estimated by the modified alkali trap method for the first time, when an approach was made to increase the vase life of Cymbidium miniature hybrid and Cymbidium hybrid ‘H. C. Aurora’ cut flowers. Metabolic inhibitors like-systemic fungicides (Carbendazim and Metalaxyl) and darkness were used to increase the vase life of the cut flowers. Cut flowers kept with metabolic inhibitors had significantly higher relative fresh weight (RFW), rate of vase solution uptake (RVSU) and significantly lower MA compared to control, which consequently increased the vase life of the cut flowers. The vase life was maximum under Carbendazim + darkness treatment (C200 + D), followed by Carbendazim (C200)> Metalaxyl +Darkness (M200 + D)> Metalaxyl (M200)> Distilled water + Darkness (D)> Control, whereas the MA was maximum under the Control treatment, followed by D > M200 > M200 + D > C200 > C200 + D treatments for both the cut flowers. The C200 + D treatment increased the vase life by ∼31 and 27% for Cymbidium miniature hybrid and Cymbidium hybrid ‘H. C. Aurora’, respectively, compared to the control treatment. It can be inferred that Carbendazim+ darkness treatment can increase the vase life of orchid cut flowers and the modified alkali trap method would be effective for estimation of MA of the cut flowers. © 2022 SAAB",Biswas S.S.; Kalaivanan N.S.; Pal R.,South African Journal of Botany,2022,10.1016/j.sajb.2022.02.001,0.975502425496504,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Absence,0.214386080665491,0.785613919334509,0.999987727215644,1.22727843558934e-5,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
13883,Evaluation of systemic fungicides for use in the glasshouse industry,"The primary evaluation of ten fungicides for the control of cucumber powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca fuliginea), tomato leaf mould (Cladosporium fulvum) and tomato grey mould (Botrytis cinerea) indicated that nine of them were systemically active against one or more of the pathogens when applied as soil drenches. Benomyl, thiophanate, thiophanate‐methyl, thiabendazole and Cela W52A showed activity against all three diseases, but dimethirimol, triarimol and dodemorph were more specific and mainly active against cucumber powdery mildew. An in vitro bioassay generally indicated that fungitoxicity was not translocated from sprayed to unsprayed leaves, and though toxicity to B. cinerea, following soil drenches of benomyl, thiophanate and thiophanate‐methyl, was detected by bioassay in leaf sap and calyces it was not detected in fruit. Furthermore, extended evaluation of benomyl for the control of grey mould on cropping tomotoes showed that in the presence of abundant B. cinerea inoculum, benomyl soil drench treatment effectively controlled flower and leaf infection but not fruit ghost‐spotting.

7899,Towards the improvement of Eucalyptus globulus chemical and mechanical pulping using endophytic fungi,"Five endophytic fungal strains isolated from Eucalyptus sp. and capable of producing laccase (Neofusicoccum luteum, Ulocladium sp., Pringsheimia smilacis, Hormonema sp., and Neofusicoccum australe) were used to pre-treat Eucalyptus globulus wood chips. After the fungal pre-treatment, chips were submitted to kraft or mechanical pulping. All the endophytic fungal strains provided higher delignification during kraft pulping than control sample. The highest increase was achieved by Hormonema sp. (26.7%), which also reduced the NaOH consumption by 11.6% and increased mechanical strength (increases in tensile, tear and burst indices of 28.4%, 15.6% and 43.9%, respectively). Regarding mechanical pulping, only N. australe was able to reduce the energy consumed during the process (8.4%). However, all pulps from fungal pre-treated chips showed higher refining degree and mechanical properties than the control pulp, which would probably allow a lower consumption of energy during mechanical pulping to achieve a specific refining degree. The best mechanical properties and the lowest kappa number were also found when Hormonema sp. was applied. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

19389,Endophytes and their potential in biotic stress management and crop production.,"Biotic stress is caused by harmful microbes that prevent plants from growing normally and also having numerous negative effects on agriculture crops globally. Many biotic factors such as bacteria, fungi, virus, weeds, insects, and nematodes are the major constrains of stress that tends to increase the reactive oxygen species that affect the physiological and molecular functioning of plants and also led to the decrease in crop productivity. Bacterial and fungal endophytes are the solution to overcome the tasks faced with conventional farming, and these are environment friendly microbial commodities that colonize in plant tissues without causing any damage. Endophytes play an important role in host fitness, uptake of nutrients, synthesis of phytohormone and diminish the injury triggered by pathogens via antibiosis, production of lytic enzymes, secondary metabolites, and hormone activation. They are also reported to help plants in coping with biotic stress, improving crops and soil health, respectively. Therefore, usage of endophytes as biofertilizers and biocontrol agent have developed an eco-friendly substitute to destructive chemicals for plant development and also in mitigation of biotic stress.

The effect of mycorrhizal inoculation, calculated as the ratio of the areas enclosed by the effectiveness curve of G. aggregatum to that enclosed by the effectiveness curves of test soils, was found to be a good indicator of the response of L. leucocephala to inoculation of soils with G. aggregatum © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Habte M.; Fox R.L.,Biology and Fertility of Soils,1989,10.1007/BF00257753,0.834153694902967,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.933512733739013,0.0664872662609873,0.999989591431645,1.04085683546584e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15251,Effects of Organic Management Mode on Soil Fungal Community Structure and Functions in Tea Gardens; [有机管理模式对茶园土壤真菌群落结构及功能的影响],"To study the soil fungal community compositions and functional groups under different management practices and slope positions, soil samples derived from the topsoil (0-20 cm) were collected from the upper, middle, and lower slope positions of conventional and organic tea gardens. High-throughput sequencing, functional predictions and the molecular ecological network analysis were performed to investigate the community structures, functional groups and ecological network of soil fungi, respectively. The two-way ANOVA including management practices and slope positions showed that the two-way interaction had no effect on the soil fungal community α-diversity. Regardless of the management practices and the slope positions, the predominant fungal phyla were Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota. Management practices did not change the compositions of dominant fungal species, but affected their relative abundance. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) shows that the soil fungal community structures differed significantly among different management practices. The community structures of soil fungi at different slope positions were noticeably different under the conventional planting pattern (P<0.05), but were similar under the organic planting pattern (P>0.05). The linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis shows that 37 biomarkers were very sensitive to the changes in the management, with different management practices enriching for different fungal populations. The numbers of degree, clustering, edges, degree centrality and closeness centrality of the fungal interaction network under the organic planting pattern were all higher than those under the conventional planting pattern, indicating that the fungal networks were more complex in the organic tea garden. Saprotrophic fungi were the dominant fungal group across all tea gardens (66.67%~70.18%). The effects of the management practices on soil fungal functions were obvious. Compared to those under the conventional planting pattern, the average abundance of endophyte-litter saprotroph-soil saprotroph, wood saprotroph and animal pathogen-endophyte-plant pathogen-undefined saprotroph significantly increased, but the average abundance of undefined saprotroph, plant pathogen and animal pathogen-plant pathogen-undefined saprotroph remarkably decreased. The spearman correlation analysis and the redundancy analysis (RDA) show that soil total phosphorus, available phosphorus, total potassium, organic matter, cation exchange capacity and pH were the main factors affecting the abundance and diversity of the soil fungal community. Organic planting drastically changes the structure and the compositions of the soil fungal community, enhances fungal network complexity and stability, and thus is beneficial to maintain the sustainable ecosystem in tea garden soil. © 2019 Editorial Office of Journal of Tea science.

1267,Management practice and soil properties affect plant productivity and root biomass in endophyte-symbiotic and endophyte-free meadow fescue grasses,"IntroductionPesticides are increasingly used in intensely managed agro-environments, with an increasingly acknowledged impact on crop production, root establishment and plant resilience. At the same time management practices are intensified with the goal to maximize productivity.Materials and MethodsIn a greenhouse, we studied the effects of three mowing regimes (uncut, and cutting 5 or 15 cm) employed three times during the season on root and shoot biomass and chlorophyll content of the cool-season grass Festuca pratensis (meadow fescue) growing in soil with a history of glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) use, the corresponding control soil, and sterilized control soil. Half of the plants hosted a systemic and vertically transmitted fungal endophyte, Epichlo & euml; uncinata, which is known to promote host grass growth.ResultsEndophyte symbiosis did not affect any tested plant parameters. Cutting the plants to 5 cm decreased both root and cumulative shoot biomass. Herbicide soil history, together with intense cutting (5 cm), caused a decrease in shoot biomass and lowered the chlorophyll content. Surprisingly, soil sterilization boosted shoot biomass and chlorophyll concentrations during less intense cutting (15 cm) and noncutting when compared to the control soil. Root biomass reduced in uncut plants when growing in soil with a history of glyphosate use.ConclusionOur results indicate that GBH residues in the soil can diminish shoot biomass when grass is frequently cut. Decreased root biomass caused by soil glyphosate history goes together with a reduction of carbon allocation belowground, which decreases grassland resilience to climate warming, increasingly occurring droughts and extreme weather events. Mowing practices can determine the biomass of grasses above and below ground. Interactions with additional stressors, such as long-term herbicide use, inhibits plant biomass productivity above and below ground, which counteracts sustainable development goals in agricultural practices. image","Keronen, S; Helander, M; Saikkonen, K; Fuchs, B",JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT,2023,10.1002/sae2.12035,0.900098658947074,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998498779537462,0.00150122046253801,0.999999999988458,1.15415454970957e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The results showed that 21 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated from Ligularia sagitta, which belonged to 3 classes, 3 orders, 7 families, and 9 genera. They were mainly divided into group I (the representative of Podospora sp.) and group II (the representative of Alternaria sp.) according to their phylogenetic relationship. Among them, Alternaria sp. and Podospora sp. were the dominant species, which were accounted for 19.05% of the isolated strains and mainly distributed in flowers and leaves. Endophytic fungi were most commonly distributed in flowers of Ligularia sagitta (accounting for 42.86% of the isolates), followed by leaves (38.10%), stems (14.29%) and roots (4.76%). The results indicated that the distribution of endophytic fungi existed obvious differences in various tissues of Ligularia sagitta. © 2021 China Agricultural University.

6800,Characterisation and dynamics of the fungal communities of Avena fatua and Echinochloa crus-galli seeds in soil seed bank,"Survival in the soil seed bank is critical to a weed maintaining populations in arable lands. The role of the seed-borne fungi in seed decay or survival needs to be determined to find solutions for reducing the weed seed banks in environmentally friendly ways. In this study, changes of the fungal microbiome after seed burial were determined in two economically important weed species, wild oat and barnyard grass. Seeds collected in different populations were buried in two sites and exhumed at intervals over the period of 1.5 years to test the seed fate. Epiphytic and endophytic fungal microbiota of seeds was characterised using both culture-based approach and NGS of ITS1 region. The proportion of visually intact seeds and decayed seeds was different between the two burial sites. The observed species richness of the isolated epiphytic fungi was higher in the fresh compared to the buried seeds. Fungal taxa determined by NGS amplicon sequencing only partly coincided with the isolated fungi, revealing higher diversity in buried seeds. The dynamic of taxonomic structure of the fungal community was less pronounced in wild oat seeds compared to the barnyard grass seeds, where both endophytic and epiphytic communities were significantly different in the buried seeds and differed between the burial sites. It can be concluded that the epiphytic fungal communities change after seed burial in both plant species, while endophytic communities are more stable in the intact seeds and changes of the fungal community in the seed endosphere may be associated with seed decay.","Necajeva, J; Boroduske, A; Nikolajeva, V; Senkovs, M; Fiipovics, M; Jakobija, I; Kalnina, I; Roga, A; Skinderskis, E; Gudra, D; Fridmanis, D",WEED RESEARCH,2024,10.1111/wre.12651,0.983127064641072,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.95074937760861,0.0492506223913896,0.99999853451324,1.46548675994396e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
13141,Laboratory evaluation of grain protectant efficacy of different foliar extracts against maize weevil - Sitophilus zeamais (Motschulsky),"The present study was aimed to evaluate six indigenous plant extracts for their ability to protect maize from infestation by maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais (M). The plant extracts were tested for its toxicity by fumigation and grain surface coating methods. Further, the effects of botanical treatments on F1 progeny, seed emergence and antifungal activities were studied. The results indicated that the extracts of Eicchornia crassipes controlled the test insect in grain surface coating method (100%, P = 0.05). Further, the same plant extract had significantly reduced the development of F1 progeny (97 ± 0.7%). In germination experiments, T + UEx samples showed normal seed germination of maize. However, in T + Ex samples, the seed germination depended on the grain protectant efficacy of the tested botanical extracts. Always higher percantage seed germination was recorded in those treatments where there was less infestation. Extracts of Carica papaya had significantly reduced the incidence of seed-borne fungus Aspergillus flavus (4 ± 2.4%) and did not affect the seed germination when compared to other treatments and untreated control. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",Chakradhar D.; Narendra A.; Nagaraju K.,Archives of Phytopathology and Plant Protection,2010,10.1080/03235400902753758,0.971096978326861,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.973651157164911,0.0263488428350895,0.999974811178325,2.51888216751261e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

2087,Changes in Neotyphodium coenophialum infestation levels in tall fescue pastures due to different grazing pressures,"Infection of tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb,) with the mutualistic fungal endophyte Neotyphodium coenophialum (Morgan-Jones & Gems) Glenn, Bacon & Hanlin results in numerous biochemical and physiological changes that increase host persistence. This study was conducted to determine effects of steer (Bos taurus L.) grazing on changes in endophyte infestation levels of tall fescue pastures, Eighteen 1.2-ha pastures were seeded in 1992 in 20-cm drill rows involving combinations of high, medium, or low grazing pressure and 'Ky 31' tall fescue infested with N. coenophialum at four levels ranging from endophyte-free (E-) to 80% infestation (E+), Pastures were grazed for about 10 mo. each year from fall 1993 until summer 1996, although animals on some of the high grazing pressure pastures occasionally had to be removed because of insufficient forage, Endophyte levels were monitored yearly with protein-A sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PAS ELISA). Stand density of tall fescue remained satisfactory throughout the study, After 2 yr, endophyte infestation levels in low grazing pressure pastures were at the same level as at the beginning of the study, and E+ levels remained constant in all pastures that started at high E+, regardless of grazing pressure. However, in high and medium grazing pressure pastures, E+ levels increased by 20 to 30%. Based on these data, we conclude that moderate and high grazing pressures influence endophyte infestation level of pastures and must be taken into account when designing pasture management systems.","Gwinn, KD; Fribourg, HA; Waller, JC; Saxton, AM; Smith, MC",CROP SCIENCE,1998,10.2135/cropsci1998.0011183X003800010033x,0.958769288294072,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.960617997182357,0.0393820028176434,0.999998884409019,1.11559098103786e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15652,Geographic distribution and ecological functions of Tetraplosphaeriaceae; [四绺孢球腔菌科真菌地理分布及其生态学功能],"Based on the multigenetic phylogenetic analysis of ITS, LSU, rpb2, tef1 and tub2, seven endophytic fungi of Pleosporales in plants of Poaceae in Yunnan Province were identified as Tetraploa and Pseudotetraploa of Tetraplosphaeriaceae and a taxonomically uncertain genus of Pleosporales. Two endophytes of Tetraploa and Pseudotetraploa were found to have stronger activities of cellulase and laccase, while the isolates of genera incertae sedis displayed comparatively weak cellulase activities and without laccase activity on sodium carboxymethyl cellulose medium and guaiacol medium, indicating that the activities of cellulose and lignin degradation abilities were different between taxa. Multiple correspondence analysis showed that the colonization of genera of Tetraplosphaeriaceae were correlated with host, isolated source and geographical location. Tetraploa and Pseudotetraploa can survive as endophytes in living healthy plants, and they also can be isolated from litter and soil. It is suggested that Tetraploa and Pseudotetraploa are endophytic and saprophytic dual-niche fungi. Further investigation of Tetraplosphaeriaceae participating in decomposition of grass plant litter is necessary for enriching our understanding of the diversity and ecological function of endophytic fungi in plants of Poaceae.

8788,ENDOGLUCANASE PRODUCTION BY ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI ISOLATED FROM Vitis labrusca L. WITH PEANUT HULL AND SAWDUST AS SUBSTRATES,"Endoglucanases are enzymes widely employed in different industrial fields, albeit with high production costs. Studies on new microbial sources and low-cost substrates are highly relevant, including those on agro-industrial. Current analysis evaluates peanut hull (PH) and sawdust (SD) as substrates for submerged cultures of 14 endophytic fungi isolated from grapevine (Vitis labrusca L.) cultivars Bordo and Concord. Endophytes were grown on a carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) medium and the cup plate assay showed that eight strains (belonging to genera Cochliobolus, Diaporthe, Fusarium and Phoma) had positive results: enzymatic halos ranged from 10.8 +/- 0.02 to 15.5 +/- 0.07 mm in diameter. Diaporthe sp. strains (GenBank accession codes KM362392, KM362368 and KM362378) and Fusarium culmorum KM362384 were highlighted as the most promising sources. Further, PH and SD as substrates for the fermentation of these fungi were evaluated by the cup plate assay and endoglucanase activity assay. Highest halo diameters were obtained for Diaporthe sp. KM362392: 16.1 +/- 0.01 mm (CMC), 14.5 +/- 0.01 mm (PH) and 14.7 +/- 0.03 mm (SD). The fungus also presented the highest levels of endoglucanase activity: analysis of variance revealed that CMC (3.52 +/- 0.98 mu mol/min), PH (2.93 +/- 0.23 mu mol/min) and SD (3.26 +/- 0.38 mu mol/min) were similarly efficient as substrates. Results deepen knowledge on V. labrusca endophytes that may be endoglucanase sources, even though further optimizations in submerged cultures with PH and SD should be undertaken to increase the enzymatic production from these wastes.","Felber, AC; Specian, V; Orlandelli, RC; Costa, AT; Polonio, JC; Mourao, KSM; Pamphile, JA",BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL,2019,10.14393/BJ-v35n3a2019-42403,0.969920468171149,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.982542704737167,0.0174572952628333,0.999998063707869,1.93629213118829e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Recently, we have explored endophyte assemblages of understory plants commonly occurring with pine. Here we report for the first time the production of the potent antifungal compound griseofulvin by a fungal endophyte isolated from eastern white pine (Pinus strobus) needles and lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium angustifolium) stems from the Acadian forest of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis has placed the endophyte strains as an undescribed Xylaria sp. Our study highlights the complexity of endophyte-host lifecycles and points to the existence of a pine-blueberry ecotype. Aside from griseofulvin, piliformic acid was isolated from one of the pine endophytes. This compound has been reported from Xylaria and related species but not from Penicillium species known to produce griseofulvin. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

38,Endophytic Fungal Community of Pinus densiflora Infected by Different Incidences of Sphaeropsis sapinea in a Mixed Coniferous Forest,"Shoot blight of pine caused by Sphaeropsis sapinea is a serious threat to the health of Pinus densiflora. However, little is known about the effect of S. sapinea on the structure of endophytic fungal communities in needles of P. densiflora. In this study, the diversity and structure of the endophytic fungal communities associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic needles of P. densiflora were investigated. Needles of P. densiflora were sampled from mixed coniferous forests, and high through-put sequencing was used to determine the diversity and community structure of endophytic fungi. The results demonstrated that endophytic fungal abundance increased when the lesion length was longer, and the endophytic fungal diversity showed an upward trend as the infection of S. sapinea worsened. The dominant genera of endophytic fungi in asymptomatic needles of P. densiflora in mixed coniferous forest was Paraconiothyrium and Selenophoma. Cenangium is considered to have a certain association with S. sapinea infection in the endophytic fungal community. The results showed that S. sapinea infection affected the endophytic fungal community in needles of P. densiflora in a mixed coniferous forest.

18298,Seed Endophyte Microbiome of Crotalaria pumila Unpeeled: Identification of Plant-Beneficial Methylobacteria.,"Metal contaminated soils are increasing worldwide. Metal-tolerant plants growing on metalliferous soils are fascinating genetic and microbial resources. Seeds can vertically transmit endophytic microorganisms that can assist next generations to cope with environmental stresses, through yet poorly understood mechanisms. The aims of this study were to identify the core seed endophyte microbiome of the pioneer metallophyte Crotalaria pumila throughout three generations, and to better understand the plant colonisation of the seed endophyte Methylobacterium sp. Cp3. Strain Cp3 was detected in C. pumila seeds across three successive generations and showed the most dominant community member. When inoculated in the soil at the time of flowering, strain Cp3 migrated from soil to seeds. Using confocal microscopy, Cp3-mCherry was demonstrated to colonise the root cortex cells and xylem vessels of the stem under metal stress. Moreover, strain Cp3 showed genetic and in planta potential to promote seed germination and seedling development. We revealed, for the first time, that the seed microbiome of a pioneer plant growing in its natural environment, and the colonisation behaviour of an important plant growth promoting systemic seed endophyte.

10151,"Palatability, digestibility and intake of endophyte free and infected tall fescue hay.","This paper aims to clarify the potential effect of the endophytic fungus, Acremonium coenophialum, on the feeding value of tall fescue hay under climatic conditions and usual management in France. Two batches of hay were harvested from two fields sown with seeds of the same variety either totally infested (E+) or free (E-) of endophyte. Presence of the endophyte had no effect on the chemical composition or in vitro digestibility in hay nor on the dry matter in situ degradation kinetic assessed following the nylon bag procedure. In vivo digestibility of both hays, assessed on sheep in individual crates, was quite similar (E+: 57.0%; E-: 57.9%). However, the E- hay was clearly preferred by sheep during the palatability test (53.1 vs 15.7% rate of consumption) and was more ingested (54.7 vs 50.1 g/kg animal metabolic weight). The results showed, therefore, that the endophyte can induce some negative effects on palatability and volontary intake of tall fescue but without altering the potential digestibility of infested hay. Regarding further investigations on the effect of infested grass forages on animal productions, it appears that emphasis should be on the level of toxicity rather than on feeding value.","Emile, JC; Ghesquiere, M; Traineau, R",ANNALES DE ZOOTECHNIE,1996,10.1051/animres:19960502,0.9575855216455,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999998795774291,1.20422570876698e-6,0.999993509580697,6.49041930345096e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19194,Cactus Endophytic Fungi and Bioprospecting for their Enzymes and Bioactive Molecules: A Systematic Review.,"Endophytic fungi are associated with plant health and represent a remarkable source of potential of enzymes and bioactive compounds, but the diversity of endophytes remains uncertain and poorly explored, especially in Cactaceae, one of the most species-rich families adapted to growing in arid and semi-arid regions. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the diversity and bioprospecting of endophytic fungi from Cactaceae. We analysed peer-reviewed articles from seven databases using PRISMA guidelines. The results showed that the Cactaceae family is a source of new taxa, but the diversity of endophytic fungi of Cactaceae is little explored, mainly the diversity among tissues and by metagenomics. Bioprospecting studies have shown that these microorganisms can be used in the production of enzymes and larvicidal and antifungal compounds. Our results are relevant as a starting point for researchers to develop studies that expand the knowledge of plant mycobiota in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, as well as comprising a remarkable source of fungal compounds with several biotechnological applications.",de Menezes Souza J; de Menezes Fonseca D; Pinheiro de Souza J; Cordeiro do Nascimento L; Mendes Hughes F; Pereira Bezerra JD; Góes-Neto A; Ferreira-Silva A,Chemistry & biodiversity,2023,10.1002/cbdv.202301413,0.895143866147633,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.98276421945351,0.0172357805464903,0.999998963203299,1.03679670060419e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19095,Roles of endophytic fungi in medicinal plant abiotic stress response and TCM quality development.,"Medicinal plants, as medicinal materials and important drug components, have been used in traditional and folk medicine for ages. However, being sessile organisms, they are seriously affected by extreme environmental conditions and abiotic stresses such as salt, heavy metal, temperature, and water stresses. Medicinal plants usually produce specific secondary metabolites to survive such stresses, and these metabolites can often be used for treating human diseases. Recently, medicinal plants have been found to partner with endophytic fungi to form a long-term, stable, and win-win symbiotic relationship. Endophytic fungi can promote secondary metabolite accumulation in medicinal plants. The close relationship can improve host plant resistance to the abiotic stresses of soil salinity, drought, and extreme temperatures. Their symbiosis also sheds light on plant growth and active compound production. Here, we show that endophytic fungi can improve the host medicinal plant resistance to abiotic stress by regulating active compounds, reducing oxidative stress, and regulating the cell ion balance. We also identify the deficiencies and burning issues of available studies and present promising research topics for the future. This review provides guidance for endophytic fungi research to improve the ability of medicinal plants to resist abiotic stress. It also suggests ideas and methods for active compound accumulation in medicinal plants and medicinal material development during the response to abiotic stress.",Zhang J; Lu J; Zhu Y; Shen X; Zhu B; Qin L,Chinese herbal medicines,2024,10.1016/j.chmed.2023.02.006,0.958783829526844,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.997501043234106,0.00249895676589351,0.999999999966996,3.3003932919939397e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
53,The Relationship between Endophytic Fungi of Chimonanthus praecox and Volatile Metabolites under Different Circadian Rhythms and Blooming Stages,"Chimonanthus praecox is an aromatic plant that flowers in winter. The composition of the floral volatiles of C. praecox is influenced by different blooming stages, circadian rhythms and species. However, the relationship between floral volatiles and plant endophytic fungi has not received much research attention. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing technology to compare and analyze the changes in the structure and diversity of the endophytic fungal communities in C. praecox under different circadian rhythms (7:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., and 7:00 p.m.) and in different blooming stages (unopened flowers and opened flowers). The endophytic fungi of C. praecox consisted of nine phyla, 34 classes, 79 orders, 181 families, 293 genera, and 397 species, and Ascomycota was the dominant phylum. Under a diurnal rhythm, the diversity (Chao1 and Shannon indices) of endophytic fungi gradually decreased in the unopened flowers, while an increasing and then decreasing trend was found for the opened flowers. In the different blooming stages, the endophytic fungal diversity was significantly higher at 7:00 a.m. in the unopened flowers compared to the opened flowers. Humidity was the key factors that significantly affected the endophytic fungal diversity and community. Moreover, 11 endophytic fungi were significantly positively or negatively correlated with seven floral volatiles. In conclusion, the community structure and diversity of endophytic fungi in C. praecox were affected by the different blooming stages and circadian rhythms, and a correlation effect related to floral volatiles was found, but there are other possible reasons that were not tested. This study provides a theoretical basis for elucidating the interrelationships between endophytic fungi, floral volatiles, and environmental factors in C. praecox.","Li, Y; Hei, JY; He, XH; Rui, R; Wang, S",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2024,10.3390/jof10020145,0.963387320288656,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999913687173071,8.63128269290676e-5,0.999999451838385,5.48161614655207e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
5864,Microbiomes across root compartments are shaped by inoculation with a fungal biological control agent,"While the endosphere is a hotspot for close interactions between plants and microbes, the influence of different components of the root endosphere on microbiome composition are seldom explored. This study used the fleshy taprooted plant, American Ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) and the recently discovered beneficial microbe, Trichoderma atroviride strain HB20111, to provide insights into microbiome shifts across plant-soil compartment niches including the bulk soil, rhizosphere, epidermis, cortex and vascular tissue. Trichoderma impacted both plant growth and microbiome composition. The survival rate of ginseng plants significantly increased from 70.8% to 85.4%, following Trichoderma treatment while root biomass production increased by 1.2 to 1.5 times compared with the uninoculated control. Microbiome diversity gradually decreased in niches from the bulk soil outside the root toward the vascular tissue, indicating increased selection and suggesting the possibility of a Trichoderma-driven induced systemic or localized resistance. The significant reduction (P < 0.05) in relative abundance of ginseng bacterial pathogens at the cortex confirmed the biocontrol capability of strain HB20111. We conclude that application of Trichoderma can improve growth of American Ginseng and mediate endosphere microbiome composition, resulting in plant pathogen inhibition.","Li, HM; Toh, R; Wei, YL; Wang, YL; Hu, JD; An, SH; Yang, K; Wu, YZ; Li, JS; Philp, J; Ryder, M; Zhou, Y; Denton, MD",APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,2022,10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.104230,0.977610655206004,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991503566972395,0.00849643302760532,0.999998901465733,1.09853426721873e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1045,Characterisation of novel perennial ryegrass host-Neotyphodium endophyte associations,"The temperate pasture grass Lolium perenne L. is commonly found in symbiotic association with the asexual fungal endophyte Neotyphodium lolii. Levels of endophyte colonisation and alkaloid content were evaluated in associations formed by plant genotypes from cv. Bronsyn with the standard endophyte (SE) and five distinct commercial endophyte strains. Bronsyn-SE produced all of the measured alkaloids (lolitrem B, peramine, and ergovaline). Bronsyn-AR1 produced only peramine, while Bronsyn-AR37 produced none of the tested alkaloids. Bronsyn-NEA2, Bronsyn-NEA3, and Bronsyn-NEA6 produced both ergovaline and peramine. Both endophyte strain and host genotype exerted significant effects on alkaloid production. Analysis of endophyte colonisation using qPCR revealed differences between each association. With the exception of Bronsyn-AR1 and Bronsyn-NEA3, host genotype also significantly affected colonisation levels. Phenotypic performance of each association was also assessed, based on measurement of morphological traits under glasshouse conditions in hydroponic culture. Significant variation due to different endophyte and host genotypes was observed. Collectively, these studies confirm that differences in both endophyte and host genotypes contribute to host-endophyte performance in a complex interactive manner.","Tian, P; Le, TN; Ludlow, EJ; Smith, KF; Forster, JW; Guthridge, KM; Spangenberg, GC",CROP & PASTURE SCIENCE,2013,10.1071/CP13067,0.837918729446153,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99999997897267,2.10273300513482e-8,1,0,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
763,Mutualism effectiveness of a fungal endophyte in an annual grass is impaired by ozone,"Ozone is an increasing tropospheric contaminant of climate change. Exposure to ozone may affect the symbiotic relationship between plants and beneficial microorganisms. In particular, the herbivore resistance mechanism conferred by fungal endophytes (defensive mutualism) may be affected, as any of the ozone-triggered effects (such as elicitation of defence mechanisms against biotrophic fungi or oxidative stress in the apoplastic space) may target the symbiont. Symbiotic and non-symbiotic Lolium multiflorum plants were exposed to ozone for two consecutive days (2h per day), after which half were infested with 10 aphids (Rhopalosiphum padi). We measured variables related to performance of plants, the endophyte symbiont (alkaloids) and the herbivores. Aphid populations were smaller on symbiotic plants than in non-symbiotic plants in low-ozone conditions. However, this difference disappeared in exposed plants to high-ozone conditions. Under low-ozone conditions, structure of aphid populations on endophyte-symbiotic plants was characterized by a low number of nymphs and a high number of adults. This pattern was not observed with high-ozone exposure. Level of fungal alkaloids (lolines) was not affected by either ozone or herbivory. Results indicate that ozone impairs the grass-endophyte symbiosis without affecting production of alkaloids generally linked with aphids' response to endophyte presence. Since neither plant biomass nor alkaloid level were affected by ozone, other ozone-mediated mechanisms at molecular or biochemical level may underlie plant-herbivore interaction mediated by fungal endophytes. Thus, the mechanism behind this effect must be determined in future experiments.","Ueno, AC; Gundel, PE; Omacini, M; Ghersa, CM; Bush, LP; Martínez-Ghersa, MA",FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY,2016,10.1111/1365-2435.12519,0.980667899395685,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.993388132500201,0.006611867499799,0.999970716049544,2.92839504559828e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
20936,"Endophytic fungi in Quercus cerris: Isolation frequency in relation to phenological phase, tree health and the organ affected","The isolation frequency of endophytic fungi in Quercus cerris was determined in relation to sampling data, the health state of the tree, and the tree organ affected. Sampling was carried out at three times, in April (budbreak), June (full vegetation) and October (leaf fall), on trees that were either healthy or in decline, and on three organs: current-year twigs, with a diameter less than 2 cm, buds, and leaves. The experiment was done in an approximately 20-year-old oak forest at an altitude of 350-400 m above sea level. Three healthy and three declining trees were sampled annually in 1999 and 2000. From each tree 20 current-year twigs, 20 buds and 10 leaves were harvested. Tissue fragments, after sterilization with 10% H2O2, were incubated on potato-dextrose-agar amended with streptomycin, at 20°C in the dark for 7 days, and the isolated mycelia maintained at 4°C on malt-extract agar. A total of 15 fungal species were isolated. All organs yielded fungal species but the greatest number of endophytic species came from current year twigs. Individual species were isolated more often from declining trees than from healthy trees, and more fungi were isolated in June (full vegetation) than in April or October. Diplodia mutila, Discula quercina and Phomopsis quercina, which are known to be pathogenetic on oaks, were present on oaks for a large part of the year. These fungi are both saprophytes (as endophytes) and parasites and are, therefore, probably a serious contributing and inciting factor in the oak decline syndrome.",Ragazzi A.; Moricca S.; Capretti P.; Dellavalle I.; Mancini F.; Turco E.,Phytopathologia Mediterranea,2001,NA,0.924221447328306,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.701264668376183,0.298735331623817,0.999962813022315,3.71869776848444e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
9043,Composition and Assembly of the Endophytic Fungal Community of Alpine Rhododendron Hosts Along Elevation Gradients,"Alpine mountain ecosystems are highly sensitive to global warming and threatened by climate change. Elevation gradients are frequently used as space-for-time surrogates for climate change in mountain ecosystems due to their correspondence with climate variables over short geographic distances. However, the distribution patterns of fungal communities in perennial woody plants along elevations in this ecosystem and how elevation and host identity affect them remain unclear. In this work, we used Illumina MiSeq DNA sequencing technology to study the rhizosphere soil fungal community and root and leaf endophytic fungal community assembly of alpine Rhododendron communities across a 3,100- to 4,100-m elevation gradient on Jiaozi Mountain, Southwest China. The abundance and diversity of fungi in different compartments varied among elevation gradients and hosts. The fungal community assembly in each compartment was mainly influenced by stochastic processes. However, the contribution of homogeneous selection, dispersal limitation, and drift varied among host identities and elevations in different compartments. The diversity and composition of rhizosphere soil, root, and leaf guilds and the overall abundance of fungal functional groups tracked the Rhododendron host identity more closely than elevation did. Most indicator taxa of fungi were putative saprotrophs. These findings will improve our understanding of the maintenance of alpine Rhododendron communities along elevation gradients.

5693,"Streptomyces typhae sp. nov., a novel endophytic actinomycete with antifungal activity isolated the root of cattail (Typha angustifolia L.)","A novel endophytic actinomycete with antagonistic activity against various phytopathogenic fungi, designated strain p1417(T), was isolated from the root of cattail (Typha angustifolia L.) collected from Yunnan Province, Southwest China. A polyphasic taxonomic study was carried out to establish the taxonomic status of this strain. Strain p1417(T) was found to have morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics typical of the genus Streptomyces. The diamino acid present in the cell wall was LL-diaminopimelic acid. Xylose and arabinose occurred in whole cell hydrolysates. The menaquinones were identified as MK-9(H-8), MK-9(H-6) and MK-9(H-4). The polar lipid profile was found to contain diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol mannoside. The major fatty acids were found to be iso-C-16:0, anteiso-C(15:0,)iso-C-15:0 and C-16:0. The genomic DNA G + C content of strain p1417(T) based on the genome sequence was 72.0 mol%. Based on 16 S rRNA gene, five housekeeping genes and whole genome sequences analysis, strain p1417(T) was most closely related to Streptomyces flavofungini JCM 4753(T) (99.4% 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity), Streptomyces alboflavus JCM 4615(T) (98.8%) and Streptomyces aureoverticillatus JCM 4347(T) (98.2%). However, the average nucleotide identity values, the digital DNA-DNA hybridization values and the multilocus sequence analysis evolutionary distances between this strain and its closely related strains showed that it belonged to one distinct species. In addition, these results were also supported by differences in the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics between strain p1417(T) and three closely related type strains. Therefore, it is concluded that strain p1417(T) represents a novel species of the genus of Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces typhae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is p1417(T) (= CCTCC AA 2019091(T) = DSM 110636(T)).","Peng, CH; Zhuang, XX; Gao, CT; Wang, ZY; Zhao, JW; Huang, SX; Liu, CX; Xiang, WS",ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GENERAL AND MOLECULAR MICROBIOLOGY,2021,10.1007/s10482-021-01561-3,0.99094883242058,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991887473011034,0.00811252698896594,0.999994104668717,5.89533128292352e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

19737,Effects of Tall Fescue Endophyte Type and Dopamine Receptor D2 Genotype on Cow-Calf Performance during Late Gestation and Early Lactation.,"Grazing endophyte-infected, toxic tall fescue reduces cow/calf production; therefore, this study examines alternate strategies such as use of novel endophyte fescue varieties during late gestation and early lactation or genetic selection of resistant cows. Pregnant cows (n = 75) were randomly assigned to fescue endophyte type: 1) endophyte-infected ergot alkaloid producing tall fescue (E+) or 2) novel endophyte-infected, non-toxic tall fescue (NOV) within maternal (A|A, n = 38 and G|G, n = 37) DRD2 genotype to examine changes in cow/calf performance and milk production during late gestation and early lactation. Grazing E+ fescue pastures during late gestation reduced cow body weight gain but did not alter calf birth weight compared to NOV. Milk production and calf ADG during the first 30 day of lactation were lower for E+ than NOV. The calving rate was reduced, but not calving interval for E+ cows. The adjusted 205-day weight of calves was lower in those grazing E+ with their dams compared to NOV. There were no interactions between DRD2 genotype and fescue endophyte type indicating that genotype was not associated with response to E+ fescue in this study.

14441,Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate fungi in plants associated with aquatic environments,"Th ere have been several reports of symbionts in the roots of plants that live in aquatic environments.

Furthermore, the presence of other groups of fungi, such as dark septate fungi (DSF), with functions supposedly analogous to those of mycorrhizal fungi, has also been reported. Th e present work provides a compilation of data regarding the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizae in plants from, or under the infl uence of, aquatic environments, and co-colonization by AMF and DSF. Forty species of non-vascular plants, ferns, fern allies, and gymnosperms from 15 families, and 659 species of angiosperms from 87 families were investigated.

Several previous studies have found a positive correlation between total antioxidant capacity (TAQ and total phenolic content (TPC) of many medicinal plant extracts. However, no information is available on whether such a relationship also exists in their endophytic fungal metabolites. We investigated the relationship between TAC and TPC for 292 morphologically distinct enclophytic fungi isolated from 29 traditional Chinese medicinal plants. The antioxidant capacities of the enclophytic fungal cultures were significantly correlated with their total phenolic contents, suggesting that phenolics were also the major antioxidant constituents of the endophytes. Some of the endophytes were found to produce metabolites possessing strong antioxiclant activities. Several bioactive constituents from the fungal cultures and host plant extracts were identified. This investigation reveals that the metabolites produced by a wide diversity of enclophytic fungi in culture can be a potential source of novel natural antioxidants.","Huang, WY; Cai, YZ; Xing, J; Corke, H; Sun, M",ECONOMIC BOTANY,2007,10.1663/0013-0001(2007)61[14:APAREF]2.0.CO;2,0.728102998576255,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991729878548442,0.00827012145155808,0.999999999986859,1.31411548309757e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

18879,Comprehensive Biotechnological Strategies for Podophyllotoxin Production from Plant and Microbial Sources.,"Podophyllotoxin is derived from plant sources and exhibits strong anticancer activity. However, limited natural availability and environmental impacts from traditional extraction methods drive the search for alternative production approaches. This review explores diverse strategies for sustainable podophyllotoxin synthesis, including biosynthesis, semi-synthesis, and biotransformation. Biosynthetic methods involve metabolic pathway engineering in plant or microbial cells, enabling increased yields by manipulating precursor availability and gene expression. Semi-synthetic approaches modify podophyllotoxin precursors or intermediates to enhance therapeutic effects, with derivatives like etoposide and teniposide showing clinical efficacy. Biotransformation, utilising organisms such as endophytic fungi or human hepatic enzymes, enables the transformation of substrates like deoxypodophyllotoxin into podophyllotoxin or its derivatives, yielding compounds with reduced environmental impact and improved purity. The anticancer efficacy of podophyllotoxin and its derivatives stems from multiple mechanisms. These compounds disrupt cell mitosis by inhibiting microtubule assembly, impairing nucleoside transport, and blocking topoisomerase II activity, leading to DNA cleavage and cancer cell apoptosis. Podophyllotoxin and its derivatives also exhibit anti-angiogenesis and anti-metastatic effects through signalling pathway modulation. Notably, derivatives like deoxypodophyllotoxin utilise advanced delivery systems, enhancing targeted efficacy and reducing side effects. Given the varied mechanisms and growing therapeutic applications, optimising biotransformation and delivery techniques remains essential for advancing podophyllotoxin-based therapies. This comprehensive review underscores the compound's potential as a robust anticancer agent and the need for continued research to maximise its production and clinical effectiveness.",Anviksha A; Reddy MS,Planta medica,2025,10.1055/a-2504-3069,0.945744789755603,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99309428648918,0.00690571351082041,0.999981832478188,1.81675218117183e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3386,"Growth, compatible solute and salt accumulation of five mycorrhizal fungal species grown over a range of NaCl concentrations","The oil sand industry in northeastern Alberta produces vast areas of severely disturbed land. The sodicity of these anthropic soils is one of the principal constraints that impede their revegetation. Previous in vitro studies have shown that the ectomycorrhizal fungi Laccaria bicolor (Maire) Orton UAMH 8232 and Hebeloma crustuliniforme (Bull) Quel. UAMH 5247 have certain salt-resistant traits and thus are candidate species for the inoculation of tree seedlings to be outplanted on salt-affected soil. In this study, the in vitro development of these fungi was compared to that of three mycorrhizal fungi [Suillus tomentosus (Kauff.) Sing., Snell and Dick; Hymenoscyphus sp. and Phialocephala sp.] isolated from a sodic site created by Syncrude Canada Ltd. Their growth, osmotica and Na/Cl contents were assessed over a range (0, 50, 100, 200 mM) of NaCl concentrations. After 21 days, the two ascomycetes (Hymenoscyphus sp. and Phialocephala sp.) were shown to be more resistant to the NaCl treatments than the three basidiomycete species. Of the basidiomycetes, L. bicolor was the most sensitive to NaCl stress, while H. crustuliniforme showed greater water stress resistance, and the S. tomentosus isolate exhibited greater Na and Cl filtering capacities and had a better biomass yield over the NaCl gradient tested. Both ascomycetes used mechanisms other than carbohydrate accumulation to palliate NaCl stress. While the Hymenoscyphus isolate accumulated proline in response to NaCl treatments, the darker Phialocephala isolate may have used compounds such as melanin. The basidiomycete species accumulated mainly mannitol and/or proline in response to increasing concentrations of NaCl.","Bois, G; Bertrand, A; Piché, Y; Fung, M; Khasa, DP",MYCORRHIZA,2006,10.1007/s00572-005-0020-y,0.985771631922398,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998252949481596,0.00174705051840366,0.999999880616476,1.19383523622396e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
9529,Endophytic Fungi Inoculation Reduces Ramulosis Severity in Gossypium hirsutum Plants,"Biotic stress in cotton plants caused by the phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum gossypii var. cephalosporioides triggers symptoms of ramulosis, a disease characterized by necrotic spots on young leaves, followed by death of the affected branch's apical meristem, plant growth paralysis, and stimulation of lateral bud production. Severe cases of ramulosis can cause up to 85% yield losses in cotton plantations. Currently, this disease is controlled exclusively by using fungicides. However, few studies have focused on biological alternatives for mitigating the effects of contamination by C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides on cotton plants. Thus, the hypothesis raised is that endophytic fungi isolated from an Arecaceae species (Butia purpurascens), endemic to the Cerrado biome, have the potential to reduce physiological damage caused by ramulosis, decreasing its severity in these plants. This hypothesis was tested using plants grown from seeds contaminated with the pathogen and inoculated with strains of Gibberella moniliformis (BP10EF), Hamigera insecticola (BP33EF), Codinaeopsis sp. (BP328EF), G. moniliformis (BP335EF), and Aspergillus sp. (BP340EF). C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides is a leaf pathogen; thus, the evaluations were focused on leaf parameters: gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and oxidative metabolism. The hypothesis that inoculation with endophytic strains can mitigate physiological and photochemical damage caused by ramulosis in cotton was confirmed, as the fungi improved plant growth and stomatal index and density, increased net photosynthetic rate (A) and carboxylation efficiency (A/Ci), and decreased photochemical stress (ABS/RC and DI0/RC) and oxidative stress by reducing enzyme activity (CAT, SOD, and APX) and the synthesis of malondialdehyde (MDA). Control plants developed leaves with a low adaxial stomatal index and density to reduce colonization of leaf tissues by C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides due to the absence of fungal antagonism. The Codinaeopsis sp. strain BP328EF can efficiently inhibit C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides in vitro (81.11% relative inhibition), improve gas exchange parameters, reduce photochemical stress of chlorophyll-a, and decrease lipid peroxidation in attacked leaves. Thus, BP328EF should be further evaluated for its potential effect as a biological alternative for enhancing the resistance of G. hirsutum plants and minimizing yield losses caused by C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides.","Silva, ID; Bessa, LA; Reis, MNO; Augusto, DSS; Roweder, C; Souchie, EL; Vitorino, LC",MICROORGANISMS,2024,10.3390/microorganisms12061124,0.97789224351321,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.976610038517601,0.0233899614823985,0.999999977429763,2.25702366796199e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

In addition to their pathogenicity to arthropods, they have many other important effects that favor their use in biological control. They live in plants as endophytes and have an inhibitory effect on plant pathogens. They inhabit the rhizosphere of many plants in natural and agricultural ecosystems and have a stimulatory effect on their growth and development. These recently acquired ecological functions are not yet fully understood, but point to the broader potential of using entomopathogenic endophytic fungi in crop production, not only as biopesticides but also as mycofungicides and growth stimulants (biostimulants). To achieve the full potential of entomopathogenic endophytic fungi in daily agricultural practice, practical application should be considered in the development of commercial products and the application techniques of entomopathogenic endophytic fungi that allow successful colonization of plants should be considered. © 2021 University of Ljubljana.

1893,Change of microbial communities in heavy metals-contaminated rhizosphere soil with ectomycorrhizal fungi Suillus luteus inoculation,"Ectomycorrhizal fungus Suillus luteus has been recognized to harbor the ability of improving rhizosphere soil nutrients and absorbing heavy metals (HMs), but effects of S. luteus inoculation on microbial communities in HMcontaminated rhizosphere soil remain unclear. A comprehensive study involving physicochemical analysis and comparative metagenomics was employed to determine the differences in soil properties, structure and function of microbial communities between inoculation and non-inoculation groups. Results showed that the concentrations of soil organic carbon, total carbon, and total nitrogen of rhizosphere soil in inoculation group were 2.1, 1.7, and 1.3 times as high as that in uninoculated group. Besides, concentrations of Cd, Pb, As, Cu, and Zn in inoculation soil were 79 %, 33 %, 65 %, 14 %, and 51 % lower than that in uninoculated soil. Metagenomic study indicated that S. luteus inoculation had no strong effect on diversity and richness of microbial communities in rhizosphere soil, but increased the relative abundance of certain HM-resistant microorganisms such as phylum Actinobacteria and genus Streptomyces. Metabolism-oriented functional annotation further revealed that in inoculation group the abundance of coding sequences related to nutrients metabolism (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolism) and HMs resistance (e.g., HMs transformation and efflux) distinctly differed from that in uninoculated group. In short, our findings may elucidate the potential contribution of S. luteus inoculation that affects the structure composition and metabolic functions of microbial communities to mediate the concentration variation of nutrients and HMs in rhizosphere ecosystem.","Yin, SQ; Zhang, X; Xie, JQ; Ye, XY; Zhang, X",APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,2023,10.1016/j.apsoil.2023.105019,0.633424119894768,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999999546251608,4.53748391521442e-7,0.999999999999284,7.15760783975838e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

4732,Endophytic Beauvea bassiana increases galling of 'Rutgers' tomato roots with Meloidogyne incognita,"Beauveria bassiana is endophytic in many plant species and has been shown to protect host plants against insect pests and plant pathogens. However, less is known about its activity against plant-parasitic nematodes. In vitro and plant assays were conducted to determine the effect of B. bassiana 11-98 (Bb) on Meloidogyne incognita (root-knot nematode; RKN). Beauveria bassiana was confirmed as an endophyte in 'Rutgers' tomato and colonization patterns of Bb in 'Rutgers' (highly susceptible to RKN) were compared with those in 'Mountain Spring' (less susceptible to RKN). In greenhouse tests with 'Rutgers' at 30 and 60 days after treatment (DAT) with RKN and Bb, there were few differences in plant growth variables among treatments in repeated trials. However, RKN root galling and egg count/root system were enhanced in plants treated with Bb at 60 DAT. In an in vitro assay with egg masses from greenhouse tests, the percentages of hatched eggs, and mobile and immobile nematodes did not differ significantly for RKN and RKN+Bb treatments. The presence of viable Bb from roots was confirmed by collecting egg suspensions from root galls and plating them on selective medium. Colonies of Bb were verified on agar medium, but no parasitism of RKN eggs was observed. Research is needed to investigate factors responsible for increased galling by RKN in the presence of endophytic Bb in 'Rutgers' tomato.","Yerukala, S; Bernard, EC; Gwinn, KD; Butler, DM; Grewal, PS; Ownley, BH",JOURNAL OF NEMATOLOGY,2021,10.21307/jofnem-2021-072,0.949742589597548,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999555949505058,4.4405049494191e-4,0.999999999940612,5.93879390109464e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1447,DIFFERENTIAL PLANT-RESPONSE TO INOCULATION WITH 2 VA MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI ISOLATED FROM A LOW-PH SOIL,"Sericea lespedeza [Lespedeza cuneata] and Ladino clover [trifolium repens] were inoculated with Acaulospora laevis and Gigaspora margarita VA mycorrhizal fungi, both isolated from a local soil having a pH of 4.4. Plants were grown in a greenhouse in fumigated (methyl bromide) soil with four rates of applied P. This soil had a pH of 5.1 for the G. margarita experiment and a 5.8 for the A. laevis experiment. Neither plant species responded to the G. margarita isolate in terms of myocorrhizal infection of roots, top growth, or elemental uptake. The A. laevis isolate caused increased growth of Ladino clover at the lowest rate of P application and increased growth of sericea lespedeza at the two lowest P application rates. Shoot tissue concentrations of P for both plant species were greater at the two lowest rates of P application when inoculated with A. laevis. Inoculation with A. laevis also resulted in different VAM fungal root colonization patterns between the two plant species as a function of P application rate. Roots of both plants had high infection rates (near 70%) for the two lowest P application rates but sericea lespedeza declined to 40 and 6% at the next two P application rates, respectively, whereas infection in Ladino clover was 74 and 41% at the next two P application rates, respectively. The results of this study support the concept that plant host-VAM fungal endophyte interactions are extremely variable and that characterization of individual combinations must be done if types and magnitudes of responses are to be defined.","WILSON, DO",PLANT AND SOIL,1988,10.1007/BF02143541,0.98003461478552,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99895943565023,0.00104056434977017,0.999950970366552,4.90296334484386e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6967,"Zn tolerance in the evergreen shrub, Aucuba japonica, naturally growing at a mine site: Cell wall immobilization, aucubin production, and Zn adsorption on fungal mycelia","Aucuba japonica Thunb. is an evergreen understory shrub that grows naturally at a mine site. The mine soil contains high concentrations of heavy metals, and A. japonica appears to maintain detoxification mechanisms against heavy metals in the study site's understory. This study aimed to investigate the heavy metal tolerance mechanisms in A. japonica, considering the possible roles of arbuscular mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi. We conducted fieldwork in summer (canopy-foliation season) and winter (canopy-defoliation season) to measure the heavy metal concentrations in leaves, branches, and roots and analyze possible detoxicants in the roots. The infection rates of arbuscular mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi were evaluated via microscopic observation, and heavy metal (Zn) localization in A. japonica roots was observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Field analysis showed that A. japonica accumulated excessive Zn and produced aucubin and citric acid in the roots in both summer and winter. Zn localization observations clarified that Zn was distributed in thickened epidermal and cortical cell walls, suggesting that the cell walls functioned as Zn deposition sites, reducing Zn toxicity. It was further clarified that Zn was contained within cortical cells, indicating that Zn might be detoxified by aucubin and citric acid. Arbuscular mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi within cortical cells adsorbed Zn on fungal cell walls, indicating that these fungi would reduce Zn content within root cells and might alleviate Zn toxicity. Our results indicated that A. japonica would maintain Zn tolerance in both summer and winter via Zn immobilization in the cell walls and production of aucubin and citric acid, and that arbuscular mycorrhizal and root-endophytic fungi might play important roles in the Zn tolerance of A. japonica.","Doyama, K; Yamaji, K; Haruma, T; Ishida, A; Mori, S; Kurosawa, Y",PLOS ONE,2021,10.1371/journal.pone.0257690,0.870282129459672,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999151834181451,8.4816581854855e-4,0.999999999638317,3.61683238914168e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2642,"Inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhiza did not affect growth, root traits or gas exchange of grafted almond saplings when exposed to drought stress","Very little is known about potential benefits of using AM inoculation as a tool to alleviate drought stress of trees grown under nursery conditions. There is some evidence that benefits of mycorrhiza on gas exchange parameters and growth of trees are proportionally greater when trees are subjected to drought stress. We hypothesized that inoculation with mycorrhiza would increase growth, nutrition, stem water potential and gas exchange of containerized almond (Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb) when young trees are grown under low water availability. In the spring of 2015 and 2016, forty containerized almond trees (Nonpareil scion grafted on Hansen 536, a peach/almond hybrid rootstock) were either inoculated or not with a commercially available arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculum and kept well-watered for 60 days in 2015 and 54 days in 2016, after which half of the plants were exposed to gradually reduced water availability over 38 days in 2015 and 61 days in 2016. Measurements included growth metrics, stem water potential, stomatal density, leaf NPK concentration, light saturated photosynthesis, and parameters calculated from CO2 response curves (Vcmax, J, TPU, Rd, gm, and stomatal limitation).The low-water treatment decreased stem water potential and reduced trunk diameter growth, light saturated photosynthesis (A), stomatal conductance (gs), Vcmax, J, TPU, gm, specific root length, leaf N and K concentration and total leaf N, P, and K content. Inoculation decreased root mass, increased leaf mass fraction, and decreased root mass fraction in 2015, but not in 2016. Neither stem water potential nor gas exchange were significantly altered by inoculation. Inoculation decreased leaf stomatal density, and slightly elevated leaf N and P concentrations in the low water treatments, although not consistently across years. Contrary to expectations we did not find substantially greater benefits from mycorrhizal inoculation in young drought stressed almond trees and conclude that the potential for mycorrhizal inoculant to alleviate drought stress in containerized trees is minimal.","McClung, TN; Lampinen, BD; Gaudin, AC; Volder, A",PLANT STRESS,2024,10.1016/j.stress.2024.100475,0.991354091886725,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999998433359113,1.56664088695868e-6,0.999999955262857,4.47371426570697e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3809,Filamentous fungi from Plantago lanceolata L. leaves: Contribution to the pattern and stability of bioactive metabolites,"The aim of this study was to test contribution of plant-associated microorganism (PAMs) to metabolite stability/instability in a medicinal plant matrix. Therefore, PAM strains were isolated and identified based on relevant DNA sequences from Plantago lanceolata leaves. Sterile water extracts of P. lanceolata were incubated with the isolated strains and antioxidants (ascorbic acid (AA), and EDTA) for 15 days, and changes in the concentrations of chief bioactive constituents (aucubin, catalpol, acteoside (=verbascoside)) were quantified by capillary electrophoresis. Phenolic breakdown-products were identified by GC-MS. PAMs were identified from the genera Epicoccum, Bipolaris, Cladosporium, Leptosphaerulina, Aspergillus, Eurotium and Penicillium (pathongens, endophytes, and other species). Some fungi caused significant decomposition of the chief constituents (p < 0.001). Surprisingly, some strains inhibited breakdown of acteoside (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, concentration of several phenolic acids increased in fungi-infested extracts (p < 0.001). Gentisic acid, 4-hydroxyphenyl acetic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and hydroxytyrosol were only present when the extract was infested with a PAM. The products are powerful antioxidants and chelators. Concentrations of phenolic acids influenced acteoside stability significantly (p < 0.01), as shown by basic data-mining techniques. AA and EDTA also significantly inhibited acteoside breakdown in sterile model solutions (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that the phenolic acid mixture (produced during the fungal proliferation) protected acteoside from breakdown, possibly via its antioxidant activity and metal complexing ability. It was shown that PAMs can increase or decrease the stability of chief metabolites in herbal matrices, and can significantly alter the chemical pattern of the plant matrix. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

9750,Gene flow in the endophyte Neotyphodium and implications for coevolution with Festuca arizonica,"Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica) often harbours asymptomatic, asexual endophytic fungi from the genus Neotyphodium. In agronomic grasses, Neotyphodium endophytes are often credited with a wide range of mutualistic benefits to its host many of which are related to fungal production of alkaloids for herbivore deterrence. Neotyphodium in the native grass Arizona fescue, however, usually produces alkaloids at levels too low to deter herbivores, and in general, does not behave mutualistically. This study uses microsatellite markers to examine rates of gene flow among four Arizona populations of Neotyphodium. Haplotypic diversity was generally low; only one population contained more than two haplotypes. Haplotypes carrying multiple loci for some or all of the microsatellite loci were also found, indicating a vegetative hybridization event between Neotyphodium and the grass choke pathogen from the genus Epichloe. Gene flow between Neotyphodium populations is very low, and likely much lower than the pollen mediated gene flow of its host. These differing rates of gene flow are predicted to create trait mismatching between endophyte and host and may explain the low, or lack of, alkaloid production by Neotyphodium in Arizona fescue and other native grass species.","Sullivan, TJ; Faeth, SH",MOLECULAR ECOLOGY,2004,10.1046/j.1365-294X.2004.02091.x,0.988678506007003,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999981143600488,1.88563995115899e-5,0.999999989484378,1.05156220397973e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The number of bacterial sequence reads obtained from 18 rose samples ranged from 63,951 to 114,833, and reads were allocated to 1982 OTUs based on sequences of the V3-V4 region. The highest Shannon Index was found in Luogang rose (1.93), while the lowest was found in Grasse rose (0.35). The bacterial sequence reads were grouped into three different phyla: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. At the genus level, Bacillus and Staphylococcus had the highest abundance across all 18 samples; Bacillus was particularly abundant in Daguo rose (99.09%), Rosa damascena (99.65%), and Fenghua rose (99.58%).

8868,"Molecular Characterization of Potential Crop Pathogens Associated with Weeds as Endophytes in Uniilorin Plantations, Nigeria","Crop diseases are usually caused by inoculum of pathogens which might exist on alternate hosts or weeds as endophytes. These endophytes, cum pathogens, usually confer some beneficial attributes to these weeds or alternate hosts from protection against herbivores, disease resistance, stress tolerance to secondary metabolites production. This study was therefore carried out to isolate potential crop pathogens which exist as endophytes on weed species in the University of Ilorin plantations. Green asymptomatic leaves were collected from 10 weed species across the plantations, and processed for their endophytic fungi isolation. Isolates were purified into pure cultures and used for molecular identification using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal DNA. Phylogenetic analysis of the fungal sequences using MEGA software revealed 9 fungal genera belonging to 13 species, with species in the genera Curvularia, Epicoccum and Daldinia occurring in more than one weed species, while other genera such as Alternaria, Fusarium, Chaetomium, Macrophomina, Arthrinium and Phomopsis occurred in just one weed species each. Daldinia eschscholtzii was isolated in this study as an endophyte from Loudetia arundinacea for the first time. This plant is very abundant in Nigeria and Africa where it is used majorly for thatching and feeding livestocks. This also represents the first endophytic fungi from the genus Loudetia. Potential relationship between the occurrences of these fungi as endophytes and as pathogens are discussed. These discoveries represent the first large-scale molecular identification and several first reports of endophytes from these weed species. These results also represent the first records of some of these fungi in Nigeria.","Lateef, A; Garuba, T; Abdulkareem, KA; Olayinka, BU; Olahan, GS; Adeyemi, SB; AbdulRahaman, AA",BAGHDAD SCIENCE JOURNAL,2022,10.21123/bsj.2022.5999,0.991551014462999,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.971983713608783,0.0280162863912169,0.999977971097322,2.20289026778842e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18834,Exploration of endophytic and rhizospheric bacteria of invasive plant Xanthium strumarium L. reveals their potential in plant growth promotion and bacterial wilt suppression.,"Plant-associated microbiome plays important role in maintaining overall health of the host plant. Xanthium strumarium displaying resilience to various environmental fluctuations may harbor some bacterial isolates which can help this plant to grow worldwide. The present study aims to isolate endophytic and rhizospheric bacteria from X. strumarium and assess their plant growth-promoting and Ralstonia solanacearum antagonism activity. From a total of 148 isolated bacteria, 7 endophytic and 2 rhizospheric bacterial isolates were found to endow with significant in vitro plant growth promotion activities. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of the 7 endophytic isolates has revealed these bacteria belonging to 5 genera viz. Curtobacterium, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Microbacterium and Paracoccus whereas, the two rhizospheric isolates were identified as species of Ralstonia pickettii and Priestia megaterium. Maximum growth promotion was observed using the strains Pseudomonas fluorescens XSS6 and Microbacterium hydrothermale XSS20 in the assay conducted on tomato plants. In the in planta inhibition assay of R. solanacearum carried out in tomato seedlings using root bacterization method, Pseudomonas fluorescens XSS6 and Panotea vagans XSS3 showed antagonistic activity with biocontrol efficacy of 94.83% and 83.96%, respectively. GC-MS analysis detected several known antimicrobial compounds in the extract of the culture supernatant of Pseudomonas fluorescens XSS6 and Panotea vagans XSS3 strains, which may contribute to the inhibition of R. solanacearum by these strains. The results of our study indicated that the bacteria associated with X. strumarium exhibit multiple plant-beneficial effects.

2823,Rhizospheric streptomycetes as potential biocontrol agents of Fusarium and Armillaria pine rot and as PGPR for Pinus taeda,"Pinus taeda is one of the main timber trees in Brazil, occupying 1.8 million ha with an annual productivity of 25-30 m(3) ha(-1). Another important species is Araucaria angustifolia, belonging to the fragile Rainforest biome, which for decades has been a major source of timber in Brazil. Some diseases that affect the roots and/or the stem of these trees and cause ""damping-off"" of the seedlings, with economic and environmental losses for the forest sector, are caused by the plant pathogenic fungi Fusarium sp. or Armillaria sp. This research project intended to isolate actinobacteria from the Araucaria rhizosphere, which present an antagonistic effect against these fungi. After the selection of the best pathogen inhibitors, morphologic characteristics, enzyme production, and their effect on the growth of Pinus taeda were studied. The actinobacteria were tested for their antagonistic capacity against Fusarium sp. in Petri plates with PDA as substrate. The inhibition zone was measured after 3, 5, 7, and 10 days. Of all the isolates tested, only two of them maintained inhibition zones up to 4 mm for 10 days. The inhibition of Armillaria sp. was tested in liquid medium and also in Petri dishes through the evaluation of the number of the fungal rhizomorphs in dual culture with the actinobacteria. It was found that all five isolates were able to inhibit the rhizomorph production, with the best performance of the isolate A43, which was capable of inhibiting both fungi, Fusarium and Armillaria. In a greenhouse experiment, the effect of five isolates on the growth of Pinus taeda seedlings was tested. Plant height, stem diameter, root and shoot dry matter were determined. The Streptomyces isolate A43 doubled plant growth. These results may lead to the development of new technologies in the identification of still unknown bacterial metabolites and new management techniques to control forest plant diseases.","de Vasconcellos, RLF; Cardoso, EJBN",BIOCONTROL,2009,10.1007/s10526-009-9226-9,0.563601046346786,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.842051212899301,0.157948787100699,0.999995989818062,4.01018193807445e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
3941,VARIATION IN DISEASE INCIDENCE IN GRAZED AND UNGRAZED SITES FOR THE SYSTEM PULSATILLA-PRATENSIS PUCCINIA-PULSATILLAE,"We have studied the interaction between the perennial host Pulsatilla pratensis and the systemic rust fungus Puccinia pulsatillae. The disease sterilizes plants by inhibiting the production of flowers. Diseased plants were also vegetatively more vigorous, producing more leaves than healthy ones. This enhanced growth of diseased plants is interpreted as being due to a trade-off between loss of reproductive capacity and vegetative growth. A 3-yr demographic study detected a tendency for greater survivorship among diseased P. pratensis plants. This may be due to the increased vigour of infected plants. No herbivore (leaf eating insects or cattle) was observed to consume P. pratensis, but disease levels varied greatly between localities that had been grazed and ungrazed by cattle. On grazed localities low disease levels prevailed while at ungrazed localities disease levels were high. This pattern appears to be due to greater survivorship among diseased plants and the failure of seedlings to establish in ungrazed localities.","WENNSTROM, A; ERICSON, L",OIKOS,1991,10.2307/3544989,0.856670076114134,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.72610697067282,0.27389302932718,0.999597498331534,4.0250166846556e-4,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
5447,Bacterial endophytes as indicators of susceptibility to Cercospora Leaf Spot (CLS) disease in Beta vulgaris L.,"The fungus Cercospora beticola causes Cercospora Leaf Spot (CLS) of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.). Despite the global importance of this disease, durable resistance to CLS has still not been obtained. Therefore, the breeding of tolerant hybrids is a major goal for the sugar beet sector. Although recent studies have suggested that the leaf microbiome composition can offer useful predictors to assist plant breeders, this is an untapped resource in sugar beet breeding efforts. Using Ion GeneStudio S5 technology to sequence amplicons from seven 16S rRNA hypervariable regions, the most recurring endophytes discriminating CLS-symptomatic and symptomless sea beets (Beta vulgaris L.ssp. maritima) were identified. This allowed the design of taxon-specific primer pairs to quantify the abundance of the most representative endophytic species in large naturally occurring populations of sea beet and subsequently in sugar beet breeding genotypes under either CLS symptomless or infection stages using qPCR. Among the screened bacterial genera, Methylobacterium and Mucilaginibacter were found to be significantly (p < 0.05) more abundant in symptomatic sea beets with respect to symptomless. In cultivated sugar beet material under CLS infection, the comparison between resistant and susceptible genotypes confirmed that the susceptible genotypes hosted higher contents of the above-mentioned bacterial genera. These results suggest that the abundance of these species can be correlated with increased sensitivity to CLS disease. This evidence can further prompt novel protocols to assist plant breeding of sugar beet in the pursuit of improved pathogen resistance.","Broccanello, C; Ravi, S; Deb, S; Bolton, M; Secor, G; Richards, C; Maretto, L; Della Lucia, MC; Bertoldo, G; Orsini, E; Ronquillo-Lopez, MG; Concheri, G; Campagna, G; Squartini, A; Stevanato, P",SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,2022,10.1038/s41598-022-14769-8,0.965364679613423,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.959283459979933,0.0407165400200669,0.999999990436448,9.5635516172976e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
8072,Daldinone derivatives from the mangrove-derived endophytic fungus Annulohypoxylon sp.,"Two new benzo[j] fluoranthene metabolites, daldinones H, J (1 and 3), and the likewise undescribed artefact, daldinone I (2), along with six known compounds (4-9) were isolated from the endophytic fungus Annulohypoxylon sp. that was obtained from the Mangrove plant Rhizophora racemosa collected in Cameroon. The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by 1D and 2D NMR as well as by HRESIMS and ECD spectra analysis. Co-cultivation of this fungus with the actinomycetes Streptomyces lividans or with Streptomyces coelicolor resulted in an up to 38-fold increase of 1-hydroxy-8-methoxynaphthalene (9), while no significant induction was detected when the fungus was co-cultivated either with Bacillus subtilis or with Bacillus cereus. Compound 2 exhibited strong to moderate cytotoxicity against Ramos and Jurkat J16 cells with IC50 values of 6.6 and 14.1 mu M, respectively. Mechanistic studies indicated that compound 2 induces apoptotic cell death caused by induction of intrinsic apoptosis. Moreover, 2 potently blocks autophagy, a potential pro-survival pathway for cancer cells. Feeding experiments with 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DHN) led to an enhanced accumulation of daldinone B (6), which supported the proposed biogenetic pathway.","Liu, Y; Stuhldreier, F; Kurtán, T; Mándi, A; Arumugam, S; Lin, W; Stork, B; Wesselborg, S; Weber, H; Henrich, B; Daletos, G; Proksch, P",RSC ADVANCES,2017,10.1039/c6ra27306h,0.512499445664545,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99899216625461,0.00100783374539012,0.999999310215215,6.89784784735359e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

17810,Tapping into the maize root microbiome to identify bacteria that promote growth under chilling conditions.,"When maize (Zea mays L.) is grown in the Northern hemisphere, its development is heavily arrested by chilling temperatures, especially at the juvenile phase. As some endophytes are beneficial for plants under stress conditions, we analyzed the impact of chilling temperatures on the root microbiome and examined whether microbiome-based analysis might help to identify bacterial strains that could promote growth under these temperatures. We investigated how the maize root microbiome composition changed by means of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing when maize was grown at chilling temperatures in comparison to ambient temperatures by repeatedly cultivating maize in field soil. We identified 12 abundant and enriched bacterial families that colonize maize roots, consisting of bacteria recruited from the soil, whereas seed-derived endophytes were lowly represented. Chilling temperatures modified the root microbiome composition only slightly, but significantly. An enrichment of several chilling-responsive families was detected, of which the Comamonadaceae and the Pseudomonadaceae were the most abundant in the root endosphere of maize grown under chilling conditions, whereas only three were strongly depleted, among which the Streptomycetaceae. Additionally, a collection of bacterial strains isolated from maize roots was established and a selection was screened for growth-promoting effects on juvenile maize grown under chilling temperatures. Two promising strains that promoted maize growth under chilling conditions were identified that belonged to the root endophytic bacterial families, from which the relative abundance remained unchanged by variations in the growth temperature. Our analyses indicate that chilling temperatures affect the bacterial community composition within the maize root endosphere. We further identified two bacterial strains that boost maize growth under chilling conditions. Their identity revealed that analyzing the chilling-responsive families did not help for their identification. As both strains belong to root endosphere enriched families, visualizing and comparing the bacterial diversity in these communities might still help to identify new PGPR strains. Additionally, a strain does not necessarely need to belong to a high abundant family in the root endosphere to provoke a growth-promoting effect in chilling conditions.

14369,A split-root system to assess biocontrol effectiveness and defense-related genetic responses in above-ground tissues during the tripartite interaction Verticillium dahliae-olive-Pseudomonas fluorescens PICF7 in roots,"Background and aims: The olive root endophyte Pseudomonas fluorescens PICF7 is an effective biocontrol agent of Verticillium wilt of olive (VWO). Colonization of olive roots either by strain PICF7 or by Verticillium dahliae triggers differential systemic transcriptomic responses, many of them related with defense-related genes. The aims were to develop an olive split-root system for assessing VWO development and biocontrol effectiveness of strain PICF7 in plants with a divided root architecture, and for evaluating systemic defense responses during this tripartite interaction when strain PICF7 and V. dahliae are spatially separated. Methods: An olive split-root system was generated and disease development, biocontrol effectiveness and systemic genetic responses in these plants upon strain PICF7 and V. dahliae colonization were compared to those reported and observed in olive plants grown under standard conditions (single pots). Specific defense-related genes, previously identified during PICF7- and/or V. dahliae-olive root interactions were selected and their expression patterns assessed in above-ground tissues by real-time qPCR analyses. Results: Symptoms of VWO developed similarly both in split-root and single-root plants. However, even though PICF7 triggered systemic defense responses in aerial tissues prior to the infection by V. dahliae, effective biocontrol was not observed under these experimental conditions. While most of studied genes showed similar expression patterns along time in both systems (i.e. split root and single pot), some of them (e.g. the caffeoyl-O-methyltransferase coding gene) varied depending on whether strain PICF7 and V. dahliae were spatially separated or shared the same compartment. Conclusions: A successful split-root system was generated to investigate genetic events taking place during the tripartite interaction olive-V. dahliae-P. fluorescens PICF7. VWO biocontrol by strain PICF7 must rely on mechanisms other than induction of systemic resistance responses. The expression pattern of specific defense-related olive genes depended on whether or not the biocontrol agent and the pathogen share the same root/soil region. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Cabanás C.G.-L.; Sesmero R.; Valverde-Corredor A.; Javier López-Escudero F.; Mercado-Blanco J.,Plant and Soil,2017,10.1007/s11104-017-3269-y,0.881702431524322,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.986013887279449,0.0139861127205513,0.997429468465787,0.00257053153421272,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2495,Incorporating the process of vertical transmission into understanding of host-symbiont dynamics,"Variation exists in the frequency of obligate, vertically transmitted symbiotic organisms within and among host populations; however, these patterns have not been adequately explained by variable fitness effects of symbionts on their hosts. In this forum, we call attention to another equally important, but overlooked mechanism to maintain variation in the frequency of symbioses in nature: the rate of vertical transmission. On ecological time scales, vertical transmission can affect the equilibrium frequencies of symbionts in host populations, with potential consequences for population and community dynamics. In addition, vertical transmission has the potential to influence the evolution of symbiosis, by affecting the probability of fixation of symbiosis (and therefore the evolution of complexity) and by allowing hosts to sanction against costly symbionts. Here we use grass-epichloae symbioses as a model system to explore the causes and consequences of variation in vertical transmission rates. We identify critical points for symbiont transmission that emerge from considering the host growth cycle devoted to reproduction (asexual vs sexual) and the host capability to maintain homeostasis. We also use information on the process of transmission to predict the environmental factors that would most likely affect transmission rates. Altogether, we aim to highlight the vertical transmission rate as an important process for understanding the ecology and evolution of symbiosis, using grass-epichloae interactions as a case study.","Gundel, PE; Rudgers, JA; Ghersa, CM",OIKOS,2011,10.1111/j.1600-0706.2011.19299.x,0.587318617872027,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999347555759964,6.5244424003547e-4,0.999999999901329,9.867051620204849e-11,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

[Methodology] The development of five strains was compared under both optimal and high-temperature conditions (up to 35 degrees C) regarding the production of conidia, mycelium growth, and germination. Subsequently, the effect of the strain with the highest yield on the growth of seedlings of S. lycopersicum, cultivar'Gladiator', was assessed under the same temperature conditions. Furthermore, each strain was identified using PCR amplification of the nuclear intergenic region Bloc and elongation factor EF1-alpha. [Results] Strains were identified as Beauveria bassiana of neotropical lineage. No significant differences were found in the conidia production between treatments (p-value > 0.05), as opposed to mycelial growth. Minor but significant changes were observed in root-to-surface ratios but not in any other evaluated variables, and only for seedlings treated with strain H-31.

2707,Analysis of Stored Wheat Grain-Associated Microbiota Reveals Biocontrol Activity among Microorganisms against Mycotoxigenic Fungi,"Wheat grains are colonized by complex microbial communities that have the potential to affect seed quality and susceptibility to disease. Some of the beneficial microbes in these communities have been shown to protect plants against pathogens through antagonism. We evaluated the role of the microbiome in seed health: in particular, against mycotoxin-producing fungi. Amplicon sequencing was used to characterize the seed microbiome and determine if epiphytes and endophytes differ in their fungal and bacterial diversity and community composition. We then isolated culturable fungal and bacterial species and evaluated their antagonistic activity against mycotoxigenic fungi. The most prevalent taxa were found to be shared between the epiphytic and endophytic microbiota of stored wheat seeds. Among the isolated bacteria, Bacillus strains exhibited strong antagonistic properties against fungal pathogens with noteworthy fungal load reduction in wheat grain samples of up to a 3.59 log(10) CFU/g compared to untreated controls. We also found that a strain of the yeast, Rhodotorula glutinis, isolated from wheat grains, degrades and/or metabolizes aflatoxin B-1, one of the most dangerous mycotoxins that negatively affects physiological processes in animals and humans. The mycotoxin level in grain samples was significantly reduced up to 65% in the presence of the yeast strain, compared to the untreated control. Our study demonstrates that stored wheat grains are a rich source of bacterial and yeast antagonists with strong inhibitory and biodegradation potential against mycotoxigenic fungi and the mycotoxins they produce, respectively. Utilization of these antagonistic microorganisms may help reduce fungal and mycotoxin contamination, and potentially replace traditionally used synthetic chemicals.","Solanki, MK; Abdelfattah, A; Sadhasivam, S; Zakin, V; Wisniewski, M; Droby, S; Sionov, E",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2021,10.3390/jof7090781,0.984345540693626,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.983120960031315,0.0168790399686845,0.999999830054502,1.69945497896506e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

19758,Structural basis for a bacterial Pip system plant effector recognition protein.,"A number of plant-associated proteobacteria have LuxR family transcription factors that we refer to as PipR subfamily members. PipR proteins play roles in interactions between bacteria and their plant hosts, and some are important for bacterial virulence of plants. We identified an ethanolamine derivative, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-(2-hydroxyethylamino) acetamide (HEHEAA), as a potent effector of PipR-mediated gene regulation in the plant endophyte Pseudomonas GM79. HEHEAA-dependent PipR activity requires an ATP-binding cassette-type active transport system, and the periplasmic substrate-binding protein (SBP) of that system binds HEHEAA. To begin to understand the molecular basis of PipR system responses to plant factors we crystallized a HEHEAA-responsive SBP in the free- and HEHEAA-bound forms. The SBP, which is similar to peptide-binding SBPs, was in a closed conformation. A narrow cavity at the interface of its two lobes is wide enough to bind HEHEAA, but it cannot accommodate peptides with side chains. The polar atoms of HEHEAA are recognized by hydrogen-bonding interactions, and additional SBP residues contribute to the binding site. This binding mode was confirmed by a structure-based mutational analysis. We also show that a closely related SBP from the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 does not recognize HEHEAA. However, a single amino acid substitution in the presumed effector-binding pocket of the P. syringae SBP converted it to a weak HEHEAA-binding protein. The P. syringae PipR depends on a plant effector for activity, and our findings imply that different PipR-associated SBPs bind different effectors.",Luo S; Coutinho BG; Dadhwal P; Oda Y; Ren J; Schaefer AL; Greenberg EP; Harwood CS; Tong L,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2021,10.1073/pnas.2019462118,0.775461705365493,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.904669612237649,0.0953303877623514,0.999971513756911,2.84862430893762e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance

10689,Conformational dimorphism of isochroman-1-ones in the solid state,"Isochroman-1-one derivatives, which are relatives of coumarins, display a broad spectrum of biological activity; therefore, these derivatives attract the attention of chemists. A series of new isochroman-1-ones were prepared by the reaction of benzyl-derived Grignard reagents with acyl chlorides. All of the prepared compounds were characterized using single-crystal X-ray diffraction as well as FT-IR, NMR and MS techniques. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the isochromanones can adopt two distinct conformations in the solid state. For one of the compounds, two polymorphs with unique forms crystallized separately under different temperatures. The packing of all of the examined crystals is stabilized via weak intramolecular C-H center dot center dot center dot pi and/or C-H center dot center dot center dot O interactions. Although the closed conformer was predominantly found in the actual crystals, the open conformer is thermochemically more stable for all of the examined compounds according to DFT calculations.

9636,A New Approach to Produce Resveratrol by Enzymatic Bioconversion,"An enzymatic reaction system was developed and optimized for bioconversion of resveratrol from glucose. Liquid enzyme extracts were prepared from Alternaria sp. MG1, an endophytic fungus from grape, and used directly or after immobilization with sodium alginate. When the enzyme solution was used, efficient production of resveratrol was found within 120 min in a manner that was pH-, reaction time-, enzyme amount-, substrate type-, and substrate concentration-dependent. After the optimization experiments using the response surface methodology, the highest value of resveratrol production (224.40. g/l) was found under the conditions of pH 6.84, 0.35 g/l glucose, 0.02 mg/l coenzyme A, and 0.02 mg/l ATP. Immobilized enzyme extracts could keep high production of resveratrol during recycling use for two to five times. The developed system indicated a potential approach to resveratrol biosynthesis independent of plants and fungal cell growth, and provided a possible way to produce resveratrol within 2 h, the shortest period needed for biosynthesis of resveratrol so far.","Che, JX; Shi, JL; Gao, ZH; Zhang, Y",JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY,2016,10.4014/jmb.1512.12084,0.99488091559311,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.797636857184959,0.202363142815041,0.999999994079597,5.92040305669173e-9,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

5773,Biological management of rhizome rot in ginger ( Zingiber officinale) plants and stored ginger seeds,"Two endospore-forming endophytic bacteria (EEB1 A8 and EEB2 B13) were isolated from ginger rhizome collected from the fields of College of Agriculture, Vellayani and identified as Bacillus spp. Their antagonistic potential against Pythium myriotylum, the soft rot pathogen of ginger, was analyzed in vitro by dual culture plate assay and the agar well diffusion method. They tested positive for biocontrol traits such as the production of hydrogen cyanide, siderophore and volatile organic compounds. The bacterial isolates were applied to ginger plants to test biocontrol efficiency against P. myriotylum, individually and in combination with Piriformospora indica, a fungal root endophyte capable of promoting plant growth and enhancing plant defense. A lesser percent disease index (PDI) was observed in plants where the combination of EEB1 A8 and P. indica was applied. The activity of enzymes pertinent to protective mechanisms against pathogens, like peroxidase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, super oxide dismutase (SOD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) in the plants were analyzed before challenging, 1st, 3 rd and 5 th day after challenging with pathogen. The values followed the same trend in all treatments as it increased after inoculation up to 3 rd day and then decreased for peroxidase (PO) and SOD. The plants treated with EEB1 A8 and combination of EEB1 A8 and P. indica showed the highest values for the level of defense enzyme production. In a storage study, when ginger seed rhizomes were treated with individual bacterial isolates and as a consortium of both, followed by inoculation with the pathogen P. myriotylum, rhizomes treated with consortium were more tolerant to rhizome rot. Applying endospore-forming bacteria with biocontrol properties is a propitious method for controlling rhizome rot in ginger, in the field and during seed storage.","Nandana, MS; Anith, KN",PLANT SCIENCE TODAY,2024,10.14719/pst.4288,0.99231693024511,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99909432452603,9.0567547396978e-4,0.999999999566464,4.33536317956396e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana was inoculated six weeks after seedling emergence by spraying onto leaves and pouring onto soil for root infection, and the same amount of distilled water was applied to non-inoculated (B-) treatments. Two weeks after pathogen inoculation, disease incidence, AM colonization, chlorophyll content, photosynthetic indexes and P content, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 concentration of the perennial ryegrass host plants were measured to determine the growth, physiological and biochemical impacts of the pathogen on perennial ryegrass. It was found that the disease incidence of perennial ryegrass inoculated with pathogen ranged from 2.50%-31.25% in leaves. Both AM fungus and grass endophyte reduced the disease incidence, and also promoted P absorption and photosynthesis, and increased the biomass accumulation to some degree. Compared with control treatments, infected with grass endophyte and inoculated with AM fungus decreased disease incidence of perennial ryegrass that inoculated with pathogen in leaves by 32.00%-92.00%. In the all treatments with plants that were infected by pathogen in leaves and roots; the co-colonization of AM fungus and grass endophyte increased net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, chlorophyll content, total P content and SOD enzyme activity by 132.25% and 132.17%, 56.00% and 134.48%, 37.69% and 40.77%, 41.51% and 38.17%, 95.65% and 11.72% (P<0.05), as well as decreased MDA and H2O2 concentration by 31.36% and 24.45%, 58.62% and 22.22%, respectively.

10361,Relation of the soil microbiota of cork oak groves and surrounding grasslands to tree decline,"Cork oak (Quercus suber L.) form low-density silvopastoral systems of great ecosystemic and socioeconomic importance in the Mediterranean Basin, as they provide bark of great industrial value. Since the 1950s, these trees have been increasingly suffering from a deadly disorder known as decline, due to different biotic and abiotic factors. Associated with these forests, grasslands of great pastoral value and as carbon sequestrators develop. The aim of this work was to study the bacterial and fungal diversity present in the soils of healthy and diseased cork oaks (due to decline) and their associated grasslands, an ecosystem whose microbiome has not been studied so far by metagenomics. Soil samples were collected from cork oak forests in southern Spain and their microbial diversity was analyzed by metabarcoding with Illumina MiSeq. With respect to bacterial families, no differences were reported between cork oak forest soils and their associated grasslands, possibly due to the presence of endemic bacteria and similar environmental conditions. However, there were differences in fungal diversity between healthy cork oak forests and their associated grasslands. In the healthy cork oak soils, the families Gemmatimonadaceae and Nocardioidaceae were massively present, while in the diseased soils the fungal genus Geminibasidium was found. Regarding the functional niche, healthy cork oaks presented mainly ectomycorrhizae in their soils, while their associated grasslands presented fungal endophytes, less present in areas with diseased trees. Therefore, fungi, but not bacteria, present in the soils of cork oaks and associated grasslands could play a key role in the presence/absence of decline in cork oaks.","Marcos-Romero, JC; Poveda, J; Diez, JJ",APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY,2025,10.1016/j.apsoil.2025.106165,0.901543293106566,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.847300766747533,0.152699233252467,0.999988979958498,1.10200415024408e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
12140,Seed biopriming with potential bioagents influences physiological processes and plant defense enzymes to ameliorate sheath blight induced yield loss in rice (Oryza sativa L.),"Disease management with the use of conventional pesticides has emerged as a major threat to the environment and human health. Moreover, the increasing cost of pesticides and their use in staple crops such as rice is not economically sustainable. The present study utilized a combination of two commercial powder formulations of biocontrol agents, Trichoderma harzianum (Th38) and Pseudomonas fluorescens (Pf28) to induce resistance against sheath blight disease via seed biopriming in basmati rice variety Vasumati and compared the performance with systemic fungicide carbendazim. Sheath blight infection significantly increased the levels of stress indicators such as proline (0.8 to 4.25 folds), hydrogen peroxide (0.89 to 1.61 folds), and lipid peroxidation (2.4 to 2.6 folds) in the infected tissues as compared to the healthy control. On the contrary, biopriming with biocontrol formulation (BCF) significantly reduced the level of stress markers, and substantially enhanced the levels of defense enzymes such as peroxidase (1.04 to 1.18 folds), phenylalanine ammonia lyase (1.02 to 1.17 folds), lipoxygenase (1.2 to 1.6 folds), and total phenolics (74% to 83%) as compared to the infected control. Besides, improved photosynthesis (48% to 59%) and nitrate reductase activity (21% to 42%) showed a positive effect on yield and biomass, which compensated disease induced losses in bio-primed plants. Conversely, the comparative analysis of the efficacy levels of BCF with carbendazim revealed BCF as a potential and eco-friendly alternative for reducing disease impact and maintaining higher yield in rice under sheath blight infection.","Das, S; Kundu, S; Meena, K; Jha, RK; Varma, A; Bahuguna, RN; Tripathi, S",WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY,2023,10.1007/s11274-023-03576-6,0.832860763168518,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.887170888294614,0.112829111705386,0.999992162824927,7.83717507346626e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
10994,Production of methyl oleate by direct addition of fermented solid Penicillium sumatrense and Aspergillus fumigatus,"This work objective was to use different lipases in the methyl oleate synthesis. Endophytic fungi strains of Penicillium sumatrense and Aspergillus fumigatus were isolated from castor leaves (Ricinus communis L.) in order to acquire lipases through solid-state fermentation, using sunflower seeds as substrate. Following this, the fermented solid went through the process of obtaining the crude extract, drying or immobilization. From the enzymatic preparations, esterification reactions were performed, using oleic acid as a substrate. The enzyme immobilization and extraction resulted in loss of hydrolytic activity and reduction of esterification efficiency, showing about 70-80% of maximum conversion in 12 h of reaction. The fermented solid showed 90% conversion after 8 h reaction and after conditions optimization, it resulted in 100% conversion. The produced enzymes presented themselves to be suitable for reutilization, the A. fumigatus enzyme showed a half-life of 14 reuse cycles.

13907,SPECIFICITY OF MYCORRHIZAL ASSOCIATION IN SOME AUSTRALIAN TERRESTRIAL ORCHIDS,"Many isolations from roots of Caladenia and allied genera (Glossodia, Elythranthera and Eriochilus) from southern Australia show that these orchids are closely associated with the endophytic fungus Sebacina vermifera, and that species of Diuris are associated with Tulasnella calospora (Rhisoctonia repens). Back‐inoculation experiments with sterilized orchid seed on a medium with cellulose as the carbon source showed that Tulasnella calospora greatly stimulated germination of species of Diuris, whereas Sebacina vermifera and other species of Tulasnella from orchids had little effect. Results with Sebacina vermifera and seed of species of Caladenia have generally been less successful, but in one test the fungus greatly stimulated germination of seed of C. cornea.

11996,Marvellous Muscodor spp.: Update on Their Biology and Applications,"Nearly 20 years ago, the first report appeared on the discovery of a novel genus-Muscodor. This organism was isolated as an endophyte from a cinnamon tree that had been introduced to Honduras from Sri Lanka in the early part of the last century. Characteristically, the original Muscodor albus, and all of its species isolated since that time are non-spore producers and each one exudes a characteristic spectrum of volatile bioactive compounds. The majority have a whitish mycelium, which is sometimes coiling, intertwined and decorated with variously shaped structures. Presently, there are at least 22 type species known/documented and each has been described as an endophyte from various plant families with widely varying habitats. An enormous variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are produced by Muscodor spp. and some of these include esters, acids, aldehydes, ketones, aromatics, alkanes, alcohols, nitrosamides and terpenoids. The VOCs are both inhibitory and lethal to a wide variety of fungi and bacteria including some major pathogens of plants and humans. Interestingly, in almost all cases studied, no one compound by itself can mimic the bioactivity of the complete gas mixture, suggesting that the volatiles are acting in a synergistic manner and this has been tested with individual as well as the VOCs in various mixtures and concentrations. This review will discuss some of the recent findings in all aspects of this unique fungal genus whilst at the same time pointing out some of the major questions that remain about its biology, ecology and its applications in agriculture, medicine and other sectors. Most importantly, the authors provide arguments supporting the claim that Muscodor is taxonomically distinct from Induratia, a recently proposed change to its nomenclature.","Saxena, S; Strobel, GA",MICROBIAL ECOLOGY,2021,10.1007/s00248-020-01644-0,0.982454333008915,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996694122317385,0.00330587768261548,0.999999917293933,8.27060668839863e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16272,"Endophytic fungi from Dichrocephala integrifolia: Diversity, antifungal properties, enzymatic activities, and plant growth promotion","Dichrocephala integrifolia is a wild medicinal plant utilised in traditional healing and Ayurveda to cope up with several health issues by various groups of people around the world. Medicinal plants are associated with diverse fungal endophytes with potential bioactive properties. In this investigation, 26 fungal endophytes were isolated from D. integrifolia and three sterile forms using the Petri plate culture method. The endophytic isolation rate was highest for inflorescence (35.97%) and lowest for stem (15.61%). The highest colonization frequency was shown by F. solani (8.37%) and the lowest by Sterile morphotype 3 (1.36%). Out of the four plant parts, inflorescence was found to be highly infected, displaying an infection rate of 93.43% and the least infection occurred in the stem with 45%. The maximum number of isolated endophytic fungi belongs to the class Sordariomycetes, with a relative occurrence (%) of 71.72%. The Simpson’s diversity index reveals that the leaf endophytes were more diverse (0.94). Qualitative antifungal activity of the sporulating isolates against Curvularia lunata has shown that the maximum number of endophytes possessed Class 3 antagonism. Four isolates were selected based on screening of their antagonistic activity and their antifungal inhibition was calculated against nine fungal phytopathogens. Maximum inhibition (100%) was shown by Trichoderma sp. 2 (S2B2) against Alternaria alternata, A. brassicicola, Colletotrichum capsici, C. lunata, and Ustilaginoidea virens and least inhibition by Gliocladium sp. 1 (19.78%) against C. lunata. The four isolates were found to produce protease, lipase, amylase and cellulase enzymes. The isolates produced ammonia and hydrogen cyanide, but none of the isolates could solubilize phosphate.

At present, there are no studies that have assessed the relationship between alkaloid production and elevation or climatic factors in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. To address this knowledge gap, we explored ergot alkaloid and peramine production in Epichloe-infected (E+) Elymus tangutorum collected from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau and assessed the relationship between the concentration of these alkaloids and elevation. The effects of temperature and precipitation on these relationships were also investigated. The concentrations of ergonovine, ergine, and peramine ranged from 0.47-0.84, 0.35-1.72 and 9.18-13.00 mu g center dot g(-1), respectively. Fitted cubic regression curves describing an arc-pattern across the elevational series were statistically significant for ergine and peramine concentrations. The elevational trend in peramine concentration was linked to mean daily temperature, while the ergine elevational trend was linked to mean precipitation.

14302,Characterization of Bioactive Metabolites of Endophytic Fusarium solani Isolated from Withania somnifera,"This study was conducted to characterize and explore the endophytic fungi of Withania somnifera plant for their bioactive potential. A total of 70 segments of W. somnifera were screened and the highest species richness, as well as frequency of colonization was found in root determined as 25%. Endophytic fungi shown significant antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, E.coli, Proteus sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas sp. and were identified as Corynespora cassicola, Fusarium solani and Penicillium chrysogenum. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by the micro dilution broth was in the range of 21-82 μg/mL. Isolates revealed the presence of different phytochemicals, which includes, terpenoids, tannins, alkaloids and flavonoids. Based on its antibacterial, antioxidant and cytotoxic potential, Fusarium solani was selected, characterized genotypically by 28S rDNA typing and the sequence was deposited in NCBI database under accession number KJ193849. Fusarium solani was found to possess higher relative percentage reducing power of about 90.62% than that of Corynespora cassicola (57.47%) and Penicillium chrysogenum (52.37%) and the absorbance value obtained is comparable with the control. Percentage cell viability on cultured HeLa cell lines was determined as 6.25 μg/mL (64.74%), 12.5 μg/mL (61.08%), 25 μg/mL (58.68%), 50 μg/mL (53.24%), and 100 μg/mL (49.94%).There was significant reduction in the viability of cancer cells at 100 μg/mL.

6893,"Benefits of Endophytic Fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris Inoculation for Improving Mineral Nutrition, Quality, and Yield of Rice Grains Under Low Nitrogen and Phosphorus Condition","The deficiency of N-P availability in soil is a primary cause for crop yield and nutrient loss. Since plant-beneficial microbial symbiosis is an eco-friendly method for compensating this negative effect, understanding the interconnection between endophytic fungus colonization and mineral nutrient accumulation in edible parts of crop is important in agricultural production. In this study, we focused on the effects of endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambaris on the absorption and distribution of 14 essential mineral elements in vegetative organs (root and shoot) and reproductive organs (grain) of rice during its growing period with reduced N-P fertilizer application, as well as the changes in yield, quality, and mineral nutrition of rice grains. The possible mechanisms including the transcriptional level of the transport-related genes and the structure of endophytic community were also investigated. The results indicated that the P. liquidambaris significantly increased the accumulation of N, P, Fe, Mn, Zn, Mo, and Se in rice grains by 20.5%, 18.9%, 18.2%, 9.5%, 17.9%, 13.3%, and 17.1%, respectively, accompanied by the significant increase in yield (23.8%) and protein content (17.3%). These beneficial effects were attributed to the enhancement formation of iron plaque, the upregulation of nutrient transporters genes, and the altered endophyte community by P. liquidambaris symbiosis. In conclusion, P. liquidambaris could promote the partition of nutrients to the grains by increasing the efficiency of nutrient uptake and remobilization. Our results suggest P. liquidambaris symbiosis as a useful candidate for improving the mineral nutrition, quality, and yield of rice grains under N-P-deficient field condition.","Tang, MJ; Lu, F; Yang, Y; Sun, K; Zhu, Q; Xu, FJ; Zhang, W; Dai, CC",JOURNAL OF PLANT GROWTH REGULATION,2022,10.1007/s00344-021-10462-8,0.990834486170133,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.99978712745991,2.1287254008957e-4,0.999999982408473,1.75915265687721e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The aerial and underground parts of the plant are transcriptionally distinct and known to produce distinct spectrum of terpenoid indole alkaloids. Production of a plant-based natural drug is not always up to the desired level. Considering the limitations associated with the productivity, microorganisms serve as the ultimate and inexhaustible source of novel structures bearing pharmaceutical potential. Endophytes, the microorganisms residing inside the healthy tissues of the host plant are relatively unstudied and offer potential sources of novel natural products for exploitation in medicine, agriculture and the pharmaceutical industry. The present study was carried out to examine the localization and distribution of endophytic fungi present inside the healthy plants tissues of C. roseus (purple and white) variety. The endophytic fungi were detected by incubating the sterilized explants of C. roseus in PDA plates to promote the growth of mycelia. To locate the distribution, fungal endophytes were stained with Lactophenol cotton blue. Dense fungal colony and hyphae were observed in the xylem, phloem, and pith region of both leaf and stem tissues. Dense colonies of endophytes were also observed in cortex of root tissue.

11993,Endosphere Microbiome and Metabolic Differences Between the Spots and Green Parts of Tricyrtis macropoda Leaves,"Background Plant leaves are important organs for photosynthesis and biological energy production. The leaves of Tricyrtis macropoda have an unusual spotted pattern. However, whether the spots of T. macropoda affect the plant microbiome and metabolites is unclear. In this study, we compared differences in the endosphere microbiome and plant metabolites in green parts and spots and the effects of spots on the photosynthesis of leaves. Methods 16S/ITS sequences and metabolite spectra were obtained by high-throughput amplicon sequencing and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry, respectively. Changes in the diversity of the endophytic microbial community and metabolites were studied, and the effect of T. macropoda leaf spots on photosynthesis was examined by chlorophyll fluorescence. Results The results showed that the relative abundance of Cercospora fungi in the leaf spots of T. macropoda was significantly higher than that in the green parts (P < 0.05) while Colletotrichum fungi showed low abundance in the spots. Alkaloid and ketone metabolites were decreased in the green parts compared with the spots, and amino acids, organic acids, lipids, and other compounds were increased in the green parts compared with the spots. A combined analysis of microbial communities and metabolites showed a significant correlation between the endophytic fungal communities and metabolite production. The changes in these metabolites may cause changes in local leaf color. In addition, we found that the spot areas of T. macropoda can be photosynthetically normal. Conclusion This research showed the relationship between endophytic microorganisms and metabolites, and the findings advance our understanding of endophyte-plant interactions and provide a new direction for investigating the relationship between endophytes and phenotypes.","Wang, Y; Cheng, HY; Chang, F; Zhao, L; Wang, B; Wan, Y; Yue, M",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2021,10.3389/fmicb.2020.599829,0.941263614065455,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.627226059054765,0.372773940945235,0.999995169067863,4.83093213676788e-6,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
13887,Experiments with some of the newer systemic fungicides on apple and marrow,"In field trials against apple scab (caused by Venturia inaequalis) and powdery mildew (caused by Podosphaera leucotricha), improved control of one or other disease has been given by the newer systemic fungicides benomyl, triarimol and the thiophanates. However, in tests on apple seedlings in the greenhouse, biological evidence of translocation from individual deposits was generally limited to movement within the treated leaf. In greenhouse tests with cucumbers and marrows, using Oidium sp., there was again little evidence for movement of toxicant from a treated leaf, although effective disease control was readily obtained by root application of several compounds at low dosage. These results suggest that the systemic properties of the compounds evident when used as soil or seed treatments are of little account when they are applied as foliar sprays.

17858,Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium 14028s Genomic Regions Required for Colonization of Lettuce Leaves.,"Contamination of edible produce leaves with human bacterial pathogens has been associated with serious disease outbreaks and has become a major public health concern affecting all aspects of the market, from farmers to consumers. While pathogen populations residing on the surface of ready-to-eat produce can be potentially removed through thorough washing, there is no disinfection technology available that effectively eliminates internal bacterial populations. By screening 303 multi-gene deletion (MGD) mutants of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STm) 14028s, we were able to identify ten genomic regions that play a role in opening the stomatal pore of lettuce leaves. The major metabolic functions of the deleted regions are associated with sensing the environment, bacterium movement, transport through the bacterial membrane, and biosynthesis of surface appendages. Interestingly, at 21 days post inoculation, seven of these mutants showed increased population titers inside the leaf, two mutants showed similar titers as the wild type bacterium, whereas one mutant with a large deletion that includes the Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) showed significantly impaired persistence in the leaf apoplast. These findings suggest that not all the genomic regions required for initiation of leaf colonization (i.e., epiphytic behavior and tissue penetration) are essential for continuing bacterial survival as an endophyte. We also observed that mutants lacking either SPI-1 (Mut3) or SPI-2 (Mut9) induce callose deposition levels comparable to those of the wild type STm 14028s; therefore, these islands do not seem to affect this lettuce defense mechanism. However, the growth of Mut9, but not Mut3, was significantly impaired in the leaf apoplastic wash fluid (AWF) suggesting that the STm persistence in the apoplast may be linked to nutrient acquisition capabilities or overall bacterial fitness in this niche, which are dependent on the gene(s) deleted in the Mut9 strain.

In total 45 strains were obtained from 4 halotolerant plants and 23 representative isolates were selected to detect their tolerance against NaCl and heavy metals of Cu2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Hg2+; plant growth promoting index of nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, indoleacetic acid (IAA) production and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase. Most of the isolates could grow under high consistency of Cu2+ and Pb2+. Of the bacteria 26.1% had the ability of nitrogen fixation, 21.7% of phosphate solubilization, 60.9% of IAA production and 39.1% of ACC deaminase activity. The results of 16S rRNA sequencing show that they belonged to the genera of Bacillus, Halobacillus, Oceanobacillus, Exiguobacterium, Serratia, Brevundimonas, Vibrio and Staphylococcus.

Investigation of the growth medium EtOAc extract produced by the endophytic fungus Aspergillus terreus P63 collected from roots of the grass Axonopus leptostachyus, yielded the prenylated indole alkaloid, giluterrin, bearing an unprecedented carbon skeleton. The structure of giluterrin was established by analysis of spectroscopic data and HRMS. The absolute configuration of giluterrin was determined by combination of electronic and vibrational circular dichroism analyses.

9875,Genomic landscape of a relict fir-associated fungus reveals rapid convergent adaptation towards endophytism,"Comparative and pan-genomic analyses of the endophytic fungus Pezicula neosporulosa (Helotiales, Ascomycota) from needles of the relict fir, Abies beshanzuensis, showed expansions of carbohydrate metabolism and secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes characteristic for unrelated plant-beneficial helotialean, such as dark septate endophytes and ericoid mycorrhizal fungi. The current species within the relatively young Pliocene genus Pezicula are predominantly saprotrophic, while P. neosporulosa lacks such features. To understand the genomic background of this putatively convergent evolution, we performed population analyses of 77 P. neosporulosa isolates. This revealed a mosaic structure of a dozen non-recombining and highly genetically polymorphic subpopulations with a unique mating system structure. We found that one idiomorph of a probably duplicated mat1-2 gene was found in putatively heterothallic isolates, while the other co-occurred with mat1-1 locus suggesting homothallic reproduction for these strains. Moreover, 24 and 81 genes implicated in plant cell-wall degradation and secondary metabolite biosynthesis, respectively, showed signatures of the balancing selection. These findings highlight the evolutionary pattern of the two gene families for allowing the fungus a rapid adaptation towards endophytism and facilitating diverse symbiotic interactions.","Yuan, ZL; Wu, Q; Xu, LX; Druzhinina, IS; Stukenbrock, EH; Nieuwenhuis, BPS; Zhong, ZH; Liu, ZJ; Wang, XY; Cai, F; Kubicek, CP; Shan, XL; Wang, JY; Shi, GH; Peng, L; Martin, FM",ISME JOURNAL,2022,10.1038/s41396-021-01176-6,0.959301236580305,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.995982767898332,0.00401723210166808,0.999999996994275,3.00572489120299e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
4409,Genomic Insights into Pseudomonas protegens E1BL2 from Giant Jala Maize: A Novel Bioresource for Sustainable Agriculture and Efficient Management of Fungal Phytopathogens,"The relationships between plants and bacteria are essential in agroecosystems and bioinoculant development. The leaf endophytic Pseudomonas protegens E1BL2 was previously isolated from giant Jala maize, which is a native Zea mays landrace of Nayarit, Mexico. Using different Mexican maize landraces, this work evaluated the strain's plant growth promotion and biocontrol against eight phytopathogenic fungi in vitro and greenhouse conditions. Also, a plant field trial was conducted on irrigated fields using the hybrid maize Supremo. The grain productivity in this assay increased compared with the control treatment. The genome analysis of P. protegens E1BL2 showed putative genes involved in metabolite synthesis that facilitated its beneficial roles in plant health and environmental adaptation (bdhA, acoR, trpE, speE, potA); siderophores (ptaA, pchC); and extracellular enzymes relevant for PGPB mechanisms (cel3, chi14), protection against oxidative stress (hscA, htpG), nitrogen metabolism (nirD, nit1, hmpA), inductors of plant-induced systemic resistance (ISR) (flaA, flaG, rffA, rfaP), fungal biocontrol (phlD, prtD, prnD, hcnA-1), pest control (vgrG-1, higB-2, aprE, pslA, ppkA), and the establishment of plant-bacteria symbiosis (pgaA, pgaB, pgaC, exbD). Our findings suggest that P. protegens E1BL2 significantly promotes maize growth and offers biocontrol benefits, which highlights its potential as a bioinoculant.","de la Vega-camarillo, E; Sotelo-Aguilar, J; González-Silva, A; Hernández-García, JA; Mercado-Flores, Y; Villa-Tanaca, L; Hernandez-Rodríguez, C",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES,2024,10.3390/ijms25179508,0.908836151092683,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.976425661108405,0.0235743388915946,0.9999813212331,1.86787668999822e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The shaking extraction method with isopropanol/water was superior to the other methods due to its high sensitivity, high accuracy (recovery within or close to the range of 80-120%), and high precision (coefficient of variation of <10%). Seven loline alkaloids were identified and quantified using our newly established LC-MS/MS methods, and N-formylloline was the most abundant (5 mg/g dry matter), followed by N-acetylloline. These LC-MS/MS methods used the shortest sample handling time and the fewest sample preparation steps and proved to be good alternatives to existing GC and GC-MS analytical methods without compromising analytical efficiency. In conclusion, we developed for the first time a highly sensitive quantitative LC-MS/MS analytical method for the accurate and reproducible quantification and a LightSight-assisted LC-QTRAP/MS qualitative method for the tentative identification of loline-type alkaloids in endophyte-infected grasses.","Adhikari, KB; Boelt, B; Fomsgaard, IS",JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY,2016,10.1021/acs.jafc.6b02616,0.909891537502673,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.976183987171546,0.0238160128284542,0.999998767663408,1.23233659232724e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
8209,Metabolomics-based chemotaxonomy of root endophytic fungi for natural products discovery,"Fungi are prolific producers of natural products routinely screened for biotechnological applications, and those living endophytically within plants attract particular attention because of their purported chemical diversity. However, the harnessing of their biosynthetic potential is hampered by a large and often cryptic phylogenetic and ecological diversity, coupled with a lack of large-scale natural products' dereplication studies. To guide efforts to discover new chemistries among root-endophytic fungi, we analyzed the natural products produced by 822 strains using an untargeted UPLC-ESI-MS/MS-based approach and linked the patterns of chemical features to fungal lineages. We detected 17809 compounds of which 7951 were classified in 1992 molecular families, whereas the remaining were considered unique chemistries. Our approach allowed to annotate 1191 compounds with different degrees of accuracy, many of which had known fungal origins. Approximately 61% of the compounds were specific of a fungal order, and differences were observed across lineages in the diversity and characteristics of their chemistries. Chemical profiles also showed variable chemosystematic values across lineages, ranging from relative homogeneity to high heterogeneity among related fungi.

11392,Effect of fungal endophytes on plant growth and nutrient uptake in Trifolium subterraneum and Poa pratensis as affected by plant host specificity,"The introduction of well-adapted species, such as Trifolium subterraneum (subclover) and Poa pratensis (Kentucky bluegrass), might enhance the forage yield and quality of dehesa pastures for feeding livestock. However, the climatic hardness and poor soils in these agrosystems may limit plant establishment and development. Since fungal endophytes have been found to alleviate the environmental stresses of their host, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of five isolates on forage yield, nutritive value, and plant mineral uptake after their inoculation in the two abovementioned plant species. Two experiments were established (under greenhouse and field conditions) using plants inoculated with two isolates in 2012/2013 (Epicoccum nigrum, Sporormiella intermedia) and three isolates in 2013/2014 (Mucor hiemalis, Fusarium equiseti, Byssochlamys spectabilis). Fusarium equiseti (E346) increased the herbage yield of T. subterraneum under greenhouse conditions, and B. spectabilis improved the forage quality of T. subterraneum by reducing fiber content and of P. pratensis by increasing crude protein. S. intermedia increased the mineral uptake of Ca, Cu, Mn, Pb, Tl, and Zn in subclover, and M. hiemalis increased the uptake of K and Sr in Kentucky bluegrass. These results evidence the potential of the studied fungal endophytes to enhance herbage yield and nutritional value of forage, although further studies should include all of the target forage species as certain host specificity in the effect was observed.","García-Latorre, C; Rodrigo, S; Santamaria, O",MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS,2021,10.1007/s11557-021-01732-6,0.978588329811966,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.989846834932707,0.0101531650672925,0.999999687813617,3.12186382744883e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Concentrated crude extract thus obtained was tested against the bacterial strains by agar diffusion solid plate assay and turbidometric liquid broth assay. Antibacterial activity was further confirmed by biofilm inhibition studied by microtitre plate assay. The present findings clearly reveals tested bacterial strains were susceptible to ethyl acetate extract which were all studied by agar diffusion, turbidometric and biofilm inhibition assays.

7500,Endophytic fungi from the medicinal herb Euphorbia geniculata as a potential source for bioactive metabolites,"Many researchers proved that plant endophytes manage successful issues to synthesize active chemicals within plant cells. These bioactive compounds might support a range of plant defense mechanism against many pathogenic microorganisms. In this study, a total of 22 isolates representing 21 fungal species belonging to 15 fungal genera in addition to one variety were isolated and identified for the first time from Euphorbia geniculate plants. The genus Aspergillus was the most common fungus isolated from the studied plant. The fungus Isaria feline was recorded in both leaves and stem, while Aspergillus flavus, A. ochraceus, A. terreus var. terreus, Emercilla nidulans var. acristata, Macrophomina phaseolina colonized both stem and root. The isolated fungi showed antagonistic activities against six strains of plant pathogenic fungi viz., Eupenicillium brefeldianum, Penicillium echinulatum, Alternaria phragmospora, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium verticilloid, and Alternaria alternata in dual culture assay. The highest antagonistic activity fungal species (Aspergillus flavus, A. fumigatus, and Fusarium lateritium) and the lowest (Cladosprium herbarum, F. culomrum, and Sporotrichum thermophile) showed twining in their secondary metabolites especially terpens and alkaloids with that of their host E. geniculata. Three concentrations of (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml) of these secondary metabolites extracted by ethyl acetate and n-butanol from the above six endophytic fungal species were tested against three pathogenic fungi isolated from infected tomato plant (E. brefeldianum-EBT-1, P. echinulatum-PET-2, and A. phragmospora-APT-3), whereas these pathogens showed promising sensitivity to these fungal secondary metabolites.

12148,Fungal Diversity in Fire-Affected Pine Forest Soils at the Upper Tree Line,"Forest fires represent a significant ecological disturbance in ecosystems that increasingly affects Pinus heldreichii H. Christ forests at the upper tree line in Montenegro, due to climate change and anthropogenic factors. Soil samples were collected from five high-altitude sites in the Ku & ccaron;i Mountains, including three post-fire sites (2-, 4-, and 6-years post-fire) and two unburned control sites. High-throughput sequencing and soil chemical analyses were conducted to assess fungal diversity, community composition, and soil nutrient properties. The results showed that fungal diversity was significantly higher in unburned soils compared to post-fire soils, with the most prominent changes in ectomycorrhizal fungi, which are crucial for pine regeneration. The fungal community composition differed markedly between the post-fire and unburned sites, with specific taxa such as Hygrocybe conica (Schaeff.) P. Kumm. and Solicoccozyma aeria (Saito) Yurkov dominating the post-fire environments. Despite this, the fungal richness did not significantly change over time (2-, 4-, or 6-years post-fire), suggesting the slow recovery of fungal communities in high-altitude environments. In addition to shifts in fungal biodiversity, the post-fire soils exhibited higher levels of available phosphorus, likely due to the conversion of organic phosphorus into soluble forms during combustion. However, the organic matter content remained unchanged. This study provided important insights into the long-term ecological impacts of forest fires on high-altitude P. heldreichii forests and underlined the importance of preserving unburned forest areas to maintain fungal biodiversity and support natural regeneration, as well as the potential need for active restoration strategies in fire-affected regions.","Lazarevic, J; Topalovic, A; Menkis, A",FORESTS,2024,10.3390/f15112012,0.899472759819862,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998376200549612,0.0016237994503882,0.999999985581977,1.44180228867086e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16957,"Molecular Detection of Plasmodiophora brassicae, Causal Agent of Clubroot of Crucifers, in Plant and Soil.","Clubroot of crucifers, caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, recently has been identified in canola (Brassica napus) fields in Alberta, Canada. An effective strategy for managing the disease is to avoid planting cruciferous crops in P. brassicae-infested soil, because the pathogen produces resting spores that can remain infectious for many years. A simple, one-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol was developed to detect the pathogen in plant and soil samples. The primers TC1F and TC1R, based on a P. brassicae partial 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequence from GenBank, yielded a 548-bp product in the optimized PCR. A second pair of primers, TC2F and TC2R, which amplified a fragment of the 18S and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 regions of the rDNA repeat, also was tested and produced a 519-bp product. Neither set of primers amplified any DNA fragment from noninfected plant hosts, noninfested soil, or common soil fungi and bacteria tested in this study. Quantities of 100 fg or less of total P. brassicae DNA, or 1 × 103 resting spores per gram of soil, could be detected consistently using these primers and PCR protocol, corresponding to an index of disease of 11% or lower when the soil was bioassayed. The protocol also enabled detection of P. brassicae in symptomless root tissue 3 days after inoculation with the pathogen.

2914,Associations between Ectomycorrhizal Fungi and Bacterial Needle Endophytes in Pinus radiata: Implications for Biotic Selection of Microbial Communities,"Studies of the ecological and evolutionary relationships between plants and their associated microbes have long been focused on single microbes, or single microbial guilds, but in reality, plants associate with a diverse array of microbes from a varied set of guilds. As such, multitrophic interactions among plant-associated microbes from multiple guilds represent an area of developing research, and can reveal how complex microbial communities are structured around plants. Interactions between coniferous plants and their associated microbes provide a good model system for such studies, as conifers host a suite of microorganisms including mutualistic ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi and foliar bacterial endophytes. To investigate the potential role ECM fungi play in structuring foliar bacterial endophyte communities, we sampled three isolated, native populations of Monterey pine (Pious radiata), and used constrained analysis of principal coordinates to relate the community matrices of the ECM fungi and bacterial endophytes. Our results suggest that ECM fungi may be important factors for explaining variation in bacterial endophyte communities but this effect is influenced by population and environmental characteristics, emphasizing the potential importance of other factors biotic or abiotic in determining the composition of bacterial communities. We also classified ECM fungi into categories based on known fungal traits associated with substrate exploration and nutrient mobilization strategies since variation in these traits allows the fungi to acquire nutrients across a wide range of abiotic conditions and may influence the outcome of multi-species interactions. Across populations and environmental factors, none of the traits associated with fungal foraging strategy types significantly structured bacterial assemblages, suggesting these ECM fungal traits are not important for understanding endophyte-ECM interactions. Overall, our results suggest that both biotic species interactions and environmental filtering are important for structuring microbial communities but emphasize the need for more research into these interactions.","Rúa, MA; Wilson, EC; Steele, S; Munters, AR; Hoeksema, JD; Frank, AC",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2016,10.3389/fmicb.2016.00399,0.977957124025219,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.95039495608161,0.0496050439183902,0.999999994273666,5.7263340735858e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

18256,"Differential Modulation of Endophytic Microbiome of Ginger in the Presence of Beneficial Organisms, Pathogens and Both as Identified by DGGE Analysis.","Endophytic microorganisms play a significant role in plants response to beneficial organisms and pathogens. In the current study, endophytic microorganisms from Zingiber officinale were screened for in vitro inhibition against Pythium myriotylum.

Further, the study focussed on analysis of in vivo changes in endophytic bacterial community of Z. officinale in presence of selected organisms and the pathogen P. myriotylum by PCR-DGGE. 16S rDNA sequencing of bacterial community after DGGE has resulted in the identification of a group of uncultured bacteria as the predominant microbial community of rhizome under various conditions of treatment.

6107,Histopathology of Corn Plants Infected by Endophytic Fungi,"Simple Summary Endophytic fungi are fungi that live all or part of their life cycles within the tissues of their hosts. Although several endophyte-plant interactions are non-pathogenic in nature, it has been reported that upon infection, some endophytic fungi are able to adopt a pathogenic status resulting in disease symptoms in their host plants, ranging in severity from mild to severe. In the present study, light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to investigate the tissue colonization and cell damage of corn plants by three endophytic fungi, Fusarium verticillioides, Fusarium sacchari, and Penicillium citrinum, causing disease symptoms in the roots, stems, and leaves of infected corn plants. Tissue deterioration and cell collapse were produced by endophytic F. verticillioides, while significant cell proliferation and wall thickening were observed in corn plants infected by endophytic F. sacchari. Corn plants infected by P. citrinum showed reductions in cell diameter of the vascular bundles of infected corn tissues. The ability of endophytic fungi recovered from healthy corn plants to cause disease when inoculated in healthy tissues of other corn plants signifies their importance as determinants of corn health and productivity. Endophytic fungi inhabiting plant tissues show extensive functional diversity, ranging from mutualism to pathogenicity. The present study evaluated the histological responses of corn plants to colonization by three species of endophytic fungi isolated from corn. Corn seedlings were inoculated with 1 x 10(6) conidia per mL spore suspensions of endophytic Fusarium verticillioides, Fusarium sacchari, and Penicillium citrinum and observed for 14 days for the emergence of disease symptoms. Histological examination of diseased root, stem, and leaf tissues was conducted using light and transmission electron microscopy. The results indicated that the mean diameters of root phloem, stem vascular bundles, and leaf vascular bundles, of corn plants infected with endophytic P. citrinum (18.91 mu m, 146.96 mu m, and 107.86 mu m, respectively), F. verticillioides (18.75 mu m, 85.45 mu m, and 118.24 mu m, respectively), and F. sacchari (24.15 mu m root phloem, and 98.90 mu m stem vascular bundle diameters), were significantly lower than the root phloem (33.68 mu m), stem vascular bundle (186.77 mu m), and leaf vascular bundle (155.88 mu m) of the uninfected corn plants (p <= 0.05). Endophytic F. verticillioides was the most virulent, resulting in severe degradation and the eventual collapse of infected plant tissues. The study showed that endophytic fungi recovered from corn plants are capable of initiating significant disease responses in infected corn tissues.","Terna, TP; Nor, NMIM; Zakaria, L",BIOLOGY-BASEL,2022,10.3390/biology11050641,0.982605050723983,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.865515582520123,0.134484417479877,0.998734790999429,0.00126520900057114,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
20739,Isolation and biological activity of endophytic fungi from Withania somnifera,"Virtually all plants are hosts to bacteria and fungi that can be classified as endophytes. Endophytes are 'microbes that colonize living internal tissues of plants without causing any immediate, overt negative effects'. Many endophytes produce a variety of bioactive molecules, which is currently attracting worldwide scientific investigations towards isolation and exploration of their biotechnological promise. In the present study, Withania somnifera (F: Solanaceae) which produces withanine and withanolides used to cure various diseases was selected for exploring the endophytes associated with it. A total 15 endophytic fungi were isolated from different parts of plant like root, stem and leaf. Surface sterilization of plant material was achieved using sodium hypochlorite (10% or 20% v/v) for 10 min. The fungi were isolated by incubating the plant material on potato dextrose agar supplemented with streptomycin (250 mgl-1) at 27°. The fungal strains were identified by studying their morphological and microscopical characteristics. The fungi were fermented as static cultures in potato dextrose broth for 21 day at 27°C. The culture broth and mycelium were extracted with ethyl acetate and acetone respectively. The combined extracts were tested for antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. Aspergillus sp. (WSF-6) and Mycelia sterilia (WSF-14) showed maximum activity against bacteria B. subtilis, S. aureus, E. coli while Cladosporium sp. (WSF-15) was most active against fungi A. niger and C. albicans.

1810,"Effects of nutrient addition on endophyte-associated grass invasion in a long-term, old-field community experiment","Strictly vertically transmitted (hereditary) Epichloe spp. fungal endophytes are symbionts with cool-season pooid host grasses. Such endophytes may increase host invasiveness in the non-native, introduced ranges. However, because costs and benefits for the host can vary with the growing conditions, the endophyte may become locally or temporally extinct when costs outweigh benefits. Our long-term field experiment involved the introduction of seven Schedonorus pratensis (meadow fescue) cultivars hosting Epichloe uncinata endophyte, which represent host-grass populations differing in genetic backgrounds and Epichloe infection frequencies, to an unmanaged old field. In the first 6 years, the host grasses persisted but did not become invasive in the plant community, regardless of their endophyte infection frequency. Subsequently, we hypothesized that increasing nutrient availability would decrease endophyte costs and thus increase the host's success and abundance. We fertilized half of the plots for four additional years and re-examined S. pratensis invasiveness. We predicted that increased nutrient availability would increase S. pratensis abundance and E. uncinata frequency and concentration, as well as decrease plant community diversity, relative to unfertilized plots. Fertilization increased endophyte concentrations in three low-endophyte host populations. However, E. uncinata did not enable S. pratensis populations to achieve high abundance or to reduce plant community diversity in the old field, with or without fertilization. Thus, nutrient availabililty and host invasiveness appear to be decoupled in this study system.","Hager, HA; Roloson, JL; Shukla, K; Yurkonis, KA; Newman, JA",OECOLOGIA,2021,10.1007/s00442-021-04933-8,0.974310884761854,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.955327092564139,0.0446729074358608,0.999984844659977,1.51553400231652e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

4488,18S rDNA gene metabarcoding of microeukaryotes and epi-endophytes in the holobiome of seven species of large brown algae,"Brown algae (Phaeophyceae) are habitat-forming species in coastal ecosystems and include kelp forests and seaweed beds that support a wide diversity of marine life. Host-associated microbial communities are an integral part of phaeophyte biology, and whereas the bacterial microbial partners have received considerable attention, the microbial eukaryotes associated with brown algae have hardly been studied. Here, we used broadly targeted ""pan-eukaryotic"" primers (metabarcoding) to investigate brown algal-associated eukaryotes (the eukaryome). Using this approach, we aimed to investigate the eukaryome of seven large brown algae that are important and common species in coastal ecosystems. We also aimed to assess whether these macroalgae harbor novel eukaryotic diversity and to ascribe putative functional roles to the host-associated eukaryome based on taxonomic affiliation and phylogenetic placement. We detected a significant diversity of microeukaryotic and algal lineages associated with the brown algal species investigated. The operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were taxonomically assigned to 10 of the eukaryotic major supergroups, including taxonomic groups known to be associated with seaweeds as epibionts, endobionts, parasites, and commensals. Additionally, we revealed previously unrecorded sequence types, including novel phaeophyte OTUs, particularly in the Fucus spp. samples, that may represent fucoid genomic variants, sequencing artifacts, or undescribed epi-/endophytes. Our results provide baseline data and technical insights that will be useful for more comprehensive seaweed eukaryome studies investigating the evidently lineage-rich and functionally diverse symbionts of brown algae.","Bjorbaekmo, MFM; Brodie, J; Krabberod, AK; Logares, R; Fuss, J; Fredriksen, S; Wold-Dobbe, A; Shalchian-Tabrizi, K; Bass, D",JOURNAL OF PHYCOLOGY,2023,10.1111/jpy.13377,0.983022090874475,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.996732512358116,0.00326748764188425,0.999999991191466,8.808534457394051e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
10432,INFECTION BY PATHOGENS AND POPULATION AGE OF HOST PLANTS,"(1) The incidence of disease caused by host-specific systemic fungal pathogens was compared in populations of three host plants, Valeriana sambucifolia, Trientalis europaea and Silene dioica. (2) The study was conducted in an archipelago area in the Gulf of Bothnia, Sweden, subject to isostatic readjustment (land uplift). In this area primary succession is in strikingly different phases on different islands. The height above sea level of an island is correlated with island age and the time since it was first colonized by plants. Approximate ages of host-plant populations could thus be estimated. (3) In all three systems, disease incidence peaks during an early-intermediate phase of population development. In V. sambucifolia maximum disease (84%) occurs in forty to forty-five-year-old populations, in T. europaea in fifty to 100-year-old populations (approximately 45%), and in S. dioica in fifty to 120-year-old populations (approximately 60%). Populations with an estimated age of greater than fifty years for V. sambucifolia, > 400 years for T. europaea and > 300 years for S. dioica show low disease incidences (< 10%). (4) A significant positive correlation between disease incidence and mean host population density was detected only for the Valeriana-Uromyces system, where the pathogen has an annual cycle, in contrast to the other two pathogens, which are perennial. (5) Three hypotheses could account for the observed population age-disease incidence pattern: (i) host population size and density effects, (ii) founder effects and selection for resistance, and (iii) changes in the environment during primary succession.","CARLSSON, U; ELMQVIST, T; WENNSTROM, A; ERICSON, L",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY,1990,10.2307/2260954,0.921852109860346,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.984465539677077,0.0155344603229229,0.999998698618355,1.30138164466942e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

4496,Endophytes infection increased the disease resistance of host Achnatherum sibiricum and non-symbiotic neighbours to pathogenic fungi,"Epichloe<spacing diaeresis> infection can affect the fungal disease resistance of host grasses. However, few studies have been reported on the effects of endophyte infection on non-symbiotic neighbours. We surveyed the plant diseases in natural grassland, and compared differences of total disease index between neighboring and non-neighboring plants of Achnatherum sibiricum. Then laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of endophyte on the growth of four pathogen species as well as the brown patch of the host and its neighboring plants. The results of plant disease investigation in natural grassland showed that the major epidemic diseases of grasses were spot blight, rust disease and powdery mildew in Hulunbuir natural grassland. Among common herbages, the total disease index of endophyte-infected A. sibiricum was the lowest. Compared with nonneighboring plants, the brown patch disease index of Leymus chinensis, Stipa baicalensis and Agropyron cristatum was significantly reduced when neighbouring with A. sibiricum. The laboratory experiments results showed that the culture filtration of both Epichloe<spacing diaeresis> gansuensis and Epichloe<spacing diaeresis> sibiricum significantly restrained the growth of Curvularia lunata, Bipolaris sorokiniana, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Sclerotinia trifoliorum. The two species of endophytes could reduce lesion area of detached host leaves. In vivo plant experiments, the endophyte reduced the disease resistance of both the host and its neighbor grasses L. chinensis to C. lunata and B. sorokiniana. This study first verified that the endophytes in A. sibiricum have a positive effect on disease resistance of neighbor grasses to brown patch. The study contributes to the understanding of endophyte-host interactions and suggests potential applications of endophytes in biological control strategies for grassland management.","Shi, XJ; Zhang, JX; Qin, TZ; Liu, JM; Gao, YB; Ren, AZ",ENVIRONMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY,2024,10.1016/j.envexpbot.2024.105952,0.970771557623237,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999922110975644,7.78890243558635e-5,0.999999838596384,1.61403616250055e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Copper sulfide-sepiolite composite (SP-CuS NC) nanoplatform was developed as seed treatment agent to control seed borne fungal pathogen as well to increase the seed quality parameters after application during storage. Copper sulfide-sepiolite nanocomposite (SP-CuS NC) was prepared sonochemically by in situ synthesis of copper sulfide in aqueous media containing dispersed activated sepiolite.

Still, it is largely unknown what microbes and potential functions are involved in sustaining turfgrass, the major component of urban/suburban landscapes, under drought. We examined microbial responses to water deficits in bulk soil, rhizosphere, and root endosphere of bermudagrass by applying evapotranspiration (ET)-based dynamic irrigation twice per week during the growing season to create six treatments (0%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100%, and 120% ET) and respective drought-stressed soil conditions. Bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed via marker gene amplicon sequencing and thereafter drought-reshaped potential functions of the bacterial community were projected. Slight yet significant microbial responses to irrigation treatments were observed in all three microhabitats. The root endophytic bacterial community was most responsive to water stress. No-irrigation primarily increased the relative abundance of root endophytic Actinobacteria, especially the genus Streptomyces. Irrigation at =40% ET increased the relative abundances of PICRUSt2-predicted functional genes encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase, superoxide dismutase, and chitinase in root endosphere. Our data suggest that the root endophytic Actinobacteria are likely the key players to improve bermudagrass fitness under drought by modulating phytohormone ethylene production, scavenging reactive oxygen species, or ameliorating nutrient acquisition.","Hu, JL; Cyle, KT; Miller, G; Shi, W",FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY,2023,10.1093/femsec/fiad036,0.980839271565661,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.990833474379566,0.00916652562043433,0.99999999979363,2.06370254218768e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

The bioassay on the NCI-H1975 cell model showed that two compounds had good cytotoxic activities, and the most significant activate compound 13 had an IC50 value of 4.24 +/- 0.13 mu M, more than the positive control drug (12.99 +/- 0.13 mu M).","Wu, WY; Wei, X; Liao, Q; Fu, YF; Wu, LM; Li, L; Wu, SQ; Lu, QR; Yuan, FY; Huang, D; Sun, ZH; Yuan, T; Tang, GH",NATURAL PRODUCTS AND BIOPROSPECTING,2025,10.1007/s13659-025-00503-0,0.787688752036159,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999996937847402,3.06215259785093e-6,0.999999999999881,1.19015908239817e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
19092,Effects of sertraline hydrochloride with As(III) or Cd on rhizosphere micro-environment and root endophytes in rice.,"This study investigated the effects of the antidepressant sertraline hydrochloride (Ser-HCI) on rice physiology when combined with arsenic (III) or cadmium. Hydroponic experiments revealed that combined lower concentrations (0.2 and 0.6 mg L-1) of Ser-HCl and As (III) or Cd increased rice biomass and reduced pH and low molecular weight organic acids. The fluorescence intensity was enhanced with Ser-HCl and As-only treatments, with a significant difference (p < 0.05) in the dissolved organic matter index. There was a decrease in endophyte-specific operational taxonomic units, with proteobacteria dominating the rice root endophytes. The addition of Ser-HCl resulted in the Verrucomicrobiota increasing by 6.4 times, which was positively correlated with malic acid and negatively correlated with pH. Functional annotation highlighted alterations in carbohydrate metabolism pathways. This study provides insights into the interactive effects of Ser-HCl on rice when combined with As (III) or Cd, addressing gaps in our understanding of the impact of antidepressants on plant systems.",Gao M; Deng H; Dong Y; Qiu W; Song Z,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2024,10.1016/j.envpol.2024.124149,0.937363458061015,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.935170055842047,0.0648299441579533,0.999999680716599,3.19283401051251e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
17628,Living inside plants: bacterial endophytes.,"As current research activities have focused on symbiotic or parasitic plant-microbe interactions, other types of associations between plants and microorganisms are often overlooked. Endophytic bacteria colonize inner host tissues, sometimes in high numbers, without damaging the host or eliciting strong defense responses. Unlike endosymbionts they are not residing in living plant cells or surrounded by a membrane compartment. The molecular basis of endophytic interactions is still not well understood. Several traits involved in the establishment of endophytes have been elucidated. Culture-independent methods for community analysis and functional genomic as well as comparative genomic analyses will provide a better understanding of community dynamics, signaling, and functions in endophyte-plant associations.",Reinhold-Hurek B; Hurek T,Current opinion in plant biology,2011,10.1016/j.pbi.2011.04.004,0.749788030007787,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.78551568612946,0.21448431387054,0.999942531497524,5.74685024758992e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain_Relevance
7430,Identification and characterization of type III polyketide synthase genes from culturable endophytes of ethnomedicinal plants,"Endophytic fungi provide benefits to host plants by producing a diverse class of secondary metabolites (natural products). Arrays of polyketide natural products are synthesized by specific classes of polyketide synthases (PKS I, II and III) in host organisms. In the present study, we attempt to screen and identify type HI PKSs in culturable fungal endophytes isolated from the ethno medicinal plants including Arbus precatorius, Bacopa monnieri,Citrus aurantifolia and Datura metel to detect the genetic potential of endophytic fungi in producing bioactive compounds. A total of seventeen endophytic fungal strains belonging to eight genera were identified using fungal morphology and rDNA-ITS phylogenetic analyses. A CODEHOP-PCR based strategy was followed to design degenerate primers for the screening of type III PKS genes from fungal endophytes. We had successfully amplified partial PKS genes from eight endophytes. The amplified PKS sequences showed 60-99% identity to already characterized/putative PKS genes. From the partial sequence of FiPKS from Fusarium incarnatum BMER1, a full-length gene was amplified, cloned and characterized. FiPKScDNA was cloned and expressed in E. coil Lemo21 (DE3) and the purified protein was shown to produce pyrones and resorcinols using acyl-CoA thioesters as substrates. FiPKS showed the highest catalytic efficiency of 7.6 x 10(4) s(-1) M-1 with stearoyl CoA as a starter unit. This study reports the identification and characterization of type III PKS from endophytes of medicinal plants by CODEHOP PCR.","Manoharan, G; Sairam, T; Thangamani, R; Ramakrishnan, D; Tiwari, MK; Lee, JK; Marimuthu, J",ENZYME AND MICROBIAL TECHNOLOGY,2019,10.1016/j.enzmictec.2019.10939,0.996353732630645,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.788140521895237,0.211859478104763,0.999279015404919,7.2098459508074e-4,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
18697,Genomics of plant-associated fungi: Research progress and highlights in forage crops.,"Plant-associated fungi are fungal groups that exhibit different interactions with plants such as symbiosis (mycorrhizae), antagonistic (pathogenic) and beneficial (biocontrol), and commensal relationships. Since the publication of the first fungal genome sequence of the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe grisea in 2005, a new chapter in the genome exploration of plant-associated fungi has been initiated. Research in past decades showed about 1385 sequenced fungal genomes associated with plants. These genomes are linked with grain crops (e.g., wheat, rice), cash crops (e.g., soybean, cotton), and forage crops (e.g., alfalfa). The reported functional groups associated with plants include pathogens, endophytes, mycorrhizal fungi and saprotrophs. For the categories of plant-associated fungi based on functional groups, pathogenic fungi were the dominant group with a distribution of 96 %, followed by endophytes (2 %) and other fungi with unclear roles (2 %). For the categories of plant-associated fungi based on crop host, only 3.5 % of sequenced genomes is associated with forage crops compared with 67 % for food and cash crops. Based on the number of sequenced genomes, Fusarium belongs to the top one ranked fungal genus with wheat as the top one ranked crop host. This study reviewed the progress related to genomics studies of plant-associated fungi and highlights the need to accelerate genomic research on fungi asscoaited with forage crops.",Akber MA; Cui Y; Zhang J; Fang X,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,2025,10.1016/j.plantsci.2025.112624,0.864609866441344,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.908388450993284,0.0916115490067155,0.999983793056835,1.62069431646206e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3819,Assessing Genotypic and Environmental Effects on Endophyte Communities of Fraxinus (Ash) Using Culture Dependent and Independent DNA Sequencing,"Fraxinus excelsior populations are in decline due to the ash dieback disease Hymenoscyphus fraxineus. It is important to understand genotypic and environmental effects on its fungal microbiome to develop disease management strategies. To do this, we used culture dependent and culture independent approaches to characterize endophyte material from contrasting ash provenances, environments, and tissues (leaves, roots, seeds). Endophytes were isolated and identified using nrITS, LSU, or tef DNA loci in the culture dependent assessments, which were mostly Ascomycota and assigned to 37 families. Few taxa were shared between roots and leaves. The culture independent approach used high throughput sequencing (HTS) of nrITS amplicons directly from plant DNA and detected 35 families. Large differences were found in OTU diversity and community composition estimated by the contrasting approaches and these data need to be combined for estimations of the core endophyte communities. Species richness and Shannon index values were highest for the leaf material and the French population. Few species were shared between seed and leaf tissue. PCoA and NMDS of the HTS data showed that seed and leaf microbiome communities were highly distinct and that there was a strong influence of Fraxinus species identity on their fungal community composition. The results will facilitate a better understanding of ash fungal ecology and are a step toward identifying microbial biocontrol systems to minimize the impact of the disease.","Lahiri, A; Murphy, BR; Hodkinson, TR",JOURNAL OF FUNGI,2021,10.3390/jof7070565,0.992037475918278,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.902005000348717,0.0979949996512831,0.999279911885555,7.2008811444479e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
