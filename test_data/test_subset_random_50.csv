6565,Elucidating the endophytic bacterial and fungal community composition and diversity in the tree fern Alsophila spinulosa through meta-amplicon sequencing,"Plant tissues harbor abundant endophytes, which are crucial for plant growth. Endophytes present in Alsophila spinulosa, which is enriched with medicinal components, have not been isolated and characterized yet. Here we employed meta-amplicon sequencing to identify endophytic species and examined their diversity in the leaves, petioles, roots and stems of A. spinulosa. Our findings revealed 1,247 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for endophytic bacteria across 210 species and 476 OTUs for endophytic fungi across 222 species. Alpha diversity analysis showed the highest endophytic bacterial diversity in A. spinulosa roots, whereas fungal diversity was similar across the leaf, petiole and root tissues. Fungal diversity in the leaves and petioles was markedly higher than that in the stems. Furthermore, beta diversity analysis revealed similarities in the endophytic bacterial and fungal compositions between the leaves and petioles, whereas the compositions in roots and stems considerably differed from those in the leaves and petioles. At the genus level, the predominant endophytic bacteria were Methylobacterium-Methylorubrum and Pseudomonas, whereas the predominant endophytic fungi were Cutaneotrichosporon and Pseudofabraea. Linear discriminant analysis effect size revealed characteristic endophytic bacterial genera specific to each tissue type and characteristic endophytic fungal genera specifically in the leaves, petioles and roots. The co-occurrence network analysis indicated that the complexity of endophyte networks was the highest in the leaves and the lowest in the stems of A. spinulosa. Overall, this study elucidates the distribution patterns of endophytes in A. spinulosa across various tissues, offering valuable microbial resources for the development of natural products for medicinal application.","Chen, XH; Dou, MK; Li, YH; Su, JL; Zhao, AJ; Huang, X",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2024,10.3389/fmicb.2024.1445315,0.996689166685609,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999571944064105,4.2805593589473e-4,0.999999997616147,2.38385311490674e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
15326,Isolation and Characterization of Phosphate Solubilizing Activity of Endophytic Fungi from Zingiberaceous Species,"Phosphorus (P), which is one of the less available soil macronutrients, is important for plant growth and metabolism. A promising strategy to increase the P uptake by plants is by introducing Phosphate-Solubilizing Microorganisms (PSM) into the P-deficient regions, to convert P into soluble forms through organic acids secreted by the PSMs. The aim of this study was to characterize the phosphate solubilizing activity of endophytic fungi in wild Zingiberaceous species which is still underexplored followed by the evaluation of their organic acids production. Out of 35 endophytic fungal isolates, 4 Phosphate-Solubilizing Fungi (PSF), namely, Pestalotiopsis thailandica He06, Trichoderma atroviride El01, Trichoderma brevicrassum Am08 and Trichoderma scalesiae Al01, displayed the highest solubilization index (SI >1.0) based on plate assay. The highest amount of solubilized P in Pikovskaya broth was detected from the culture filtrate of P. thailandica (4.61 mg/L), followed by T. scalesiae (1.85 mg/L), T. brevicrassum (1.38 mg/L) and T. atroviride (1.33 mg/L) based on molybdate blue colorimetric method. The culture filtrate of P. thailandica was profiled using Gas-Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS), which revealed most of the organic acids, such as butyric, glutamic, lauric, margaric, oleic, palmitic, phthalic, propionic and stearic acid at their lowest pH (<4.0) at the end of incubation. Of the acids, phthalic acid (pKa = 2.76) was in the largest amount based on the GC-MS analysis revealing its possible contribution in P solubilization. The study then promoted P. thailandica He06 as potential P solubilizing agent for the future in planta test to assess its efficacy in the field trial. © 2022 Erman Munir, Yurnaliza, Anisa Lutfia and Adrian Hartanto.",Munir E.; Yurnaliza; Lutfia A.; Hartanto A.,OnLine Journal of Biological Sciences,2022,10.3844/ojbsci.2022.149.156,0.944447921712253,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.858252141837281,0.141747858162718,0.999999229055124,7.70944875605473e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

In this work, we analyzed the diversity of fifty strains isolated from Trifolium sp. nodules growing on Pb-Zn mine soil, in the Northeastern of Algeria and highlighted their potential symbiotic traits. The phylogeny of the 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed a high bacterial diversity with a predominance of non-rhizobial endophytes.

21427,"A Comparative biochemical study on two marine endophytes, Bacterium SRCnm and Bacillus sp. JS, Isolated from red sea algae.","Two marine endophytic bacteria were isolated from the Red Sea algae; a red alga; Acanthophora dendroides and the brown alga Sargassum sabrepandum. The isolates were identified based on their 16SrRNA sequences as Bacterium SRCnm and Bacillus sp. JS. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential anti-microbial and antioxidant activities of the extracts of the isolated bacteria grown in different nutrient conditions. Compared to amoxicillin (25μg/disk) and erythromycin (15μg/disk), the extracts of Bacterium SRCn min media II, III, IV and V were potent inhibitors of the gram-positive bacterium Sarcina maxima even at low concentrations. Also, the multidrug resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) was more sensitive to the metabolites produced in medium (II) of the same endophyte than erythromycin (15μg/disk). A moderate activity of the Bacillus sp. JS extracts of media I and II was obtained against the same pathogen. The total compounds (500ug/ml) of both isolated endophytes showed moderate antioxidant activities (48.9% and 46.1%, respectively). LC/MS analysis of the bacterial extracts was carried out to investigate the likely natural products produced. Cyclo(D-cis-Hyp-L-Leu), dihydrosphingosine and 2-Amino-1,3-hexadecanediol were identified in the fermentation medium of Bacterium SRCnm, whereas cyclo (D-Pro-L-Tyr) and cyclo (L-Leu-L-Pro) were the suggested compounds of Bacillus sp.

13698,Lichens to Gunnera - with emphasis on Azolla,"N2-fixing cyanobacteria occur in symbiotic associations with fungi (ascomycetes) as lichens and with a few green plants. The associated cyanobacterium is always a species of Nostoc or Anabaena. Only a small number of plant genera are involved but there is a remarkable range of host diversity. Associations occur with several bryophytes (e.g. Anthoceros, Blasia, Cavicularia), a pteridophyte (Azolla), cycads (nine genera including Macrozamia and Encephalartos) and an angiosperm (Gunnera). Except for Gunnera, where the cyanobacterium penetrates the plant cells, the cyanobacteria are extracellular with specialized morphological modifications and/or structures of the host plant organs providing an environment which facilitates interaction with the prokaryote. Salient aspects of current knowledge pertaining to the establishment, perpetuation, and functioning of the individual symbioses are summarized. Where possible this includes information concerning recognition and specificity, mode(s) of infection, morphological modifications/adaptations of the host plant and a synopsis of morphological, physiological and biochemical changes common to the symbiotic cyanobacteria. The latter encompasses heterocyst frequencies, enzymes involved in ammonia assimilation, photosynthetic capability and metabolic interaction with the host. The Azolla-Anabaena symbioses, which have potential agronomic significance as an alternative nitrogen source and maintain continuity with the endophyte through the sexual cycle, are emphasized. © 1986 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.",Peters G.A.; Toia Jr. R.E.; Calvert H.E.; Marsh B.H.,Plant and Soil,1986,10.1007/BF02277384,0.979135058953599,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999735633315931,2.643666840687e-4,0.999999999558435,4.4156522882588004e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
8310,Enhancement of Palmarumycins C12 and C13 Production in Liquid Culture of Endophytic Fungus Berkleasmium sp Dzf12 after Treatments with Metal Ions,"The influences of eight metal ions (i.e., Na+, Ca2+, Ag+, Co2+, Cu2+, Al3+, Zn2+, and Mn4+) on mycelia growth and palmarumycins C-12 and C-13 production in liquid culture of the endophytic fungus Berkleasmium sp. Dzf12 were investigated. Three metal ions, Ca2+, Cu2+ and Al3+ were exhibited as the most effective to enhance mycelia growth and palmarumycin production. When calcium ion (Ca2+) was applied to the medium at 10.0 mmol/L on day 3, copper ion (Cu2+) to the medium at 1.0 mmol/L on day 3, aluminum ion (Al3+) to the medium at 2.0 mmol/L on day 6, the maximal yields of palmarumycins C-12 plus C-13 were obtained as 137.57 mg/L, 146.28 mg/L and 156.77 mg/L, which were 3.94-fold, 4.19-fold and 4.49-fold in comparison with that (34.91 mg/L) of the control, respectively. Al3+ favored palmarumycin C-12 production when its concentration was higher than 4 mmol/L. Ca2+ had an improving effect on mycelia growth of Berkleasmium sp. Dzf12. The combination effects of Ca2+, Cu2+ and Al3+ on palmarumycin C-13 production were further studied by employing a statistical method based on the central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM). By solving the quadratic regression equation between palmarumycin C-13 and three metal ions, the optimal concentrations of Ca2+, Cu2+ and Al3+ in medium for palmarumycin C-13 production were determined as 7.58, 1.36 and 2.05 mmol/L, respectively. Under the optimum conditions, the predicted maximum palmarumycin C-13 yield reached 208.49 mg/L. By optimizing the combination of Ca2+, Cu2+ and Al3+ in medium, palmarumycin C-13 yield was increased to 203.85 mg/L, which was 6.00-fold in comparison with that (33.98 mg/L) in the original basal medium. The results indicate that appropriate metal ions (i.e., Ca2+, Cu2+ and Al3+) could enhance palmarumycin production. Application of the metal ions should be an effective strategy for palmarumycin production in liquid culture of the endophytic fungus Berkleasmium sp.

16893,Properties of bacterial endophytes and their proposed role in plant growth.,"Bacterial endophytes live inside plants for at least part of their life cycle. Studies of the interaction of endophytes with their host plants and their function within their hosts are important to address the ecological relevance of endophytes. The modulation of ethylene levels in plants by bacterially produced 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase is a key trait that enables interference with the physiology of the host plant. Endophytes with this capacity might profit from association with the plant, because colonization is enhanced. In turn, host plants benefit by stress reduction and increased root growth. This mechanism leads to the concept of 'competent' endophytes, defined as endophytes that are equipped with genes important for maintenance of plant-endophyte associations. The ecological role of these endophytes and their relevance for plant growth are discussed here.",Hardoim PR; van Overbeek LS; Elsas JD,Trends in microbiology,2008,10.1016/j.tim.2008.07.008,0.819641938581015,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.666743828025202,0.333256171974798,0.99999926833586406,7.31664135611432e-7,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain

Urb. leaves followed by fermentation and extraction of fungal endophytes with non-polar solvents such as chloroform, ethyl acetate and n-butanol. Preliminary phytochemical investigation of endophytic crude fractions of plant was determined to detect the presence of primary/secondary metabolites. Based on the report of our earlier studies in in vitro antioxidant activity, endophytic crude fractions of plant ethyl acetate and n-butanol exhibited potential antioxidant activity. Therefore, potential endophytic fractions were further screened for nootropic activity, using various animal models such as Elevated plus maze, Morris water maze and Passive avoidance paradigm. To know the probable mode of action in these models, estimation of whole brain acetylcholinesterase and monoamines such as nor-adrenalin (NA), and dopamine (DA) was carried out. The pretreatment of ethylacetate fungal endophytic fractions (50 mg and 100 mg/kg, p.o) exhibited significant (p<0.01) improvement in learning and memory and also revealed significant (p<0.01) decrease in whole brain Ache activity as compared to n-butanol fraction. Results were further supported by histopathological studies of young mice brain. Further, investigations are required to isolate and characterize the potential metabolites from endophytic fungal fractions of C. asiatica leaves responsible for the anti-Alzheimer's activity.","Shastry, RA; Habbu, PV; Smita, DM; Chetan, S; Kulkarni, VH",ANNALS OF PHYTOMEDICINE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL,2020,10.21276/ap.2020.9.1.22,0.996117745208112,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.86189754239196,0.13810245760804,0.999993510800906,6.48919909385093e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

2231,Reduced seed viability in exchange for transgenerational plant protection in an endophyte-symbiotic grass: does the defensive mutualism concept pass the fitness test?,"Background and Aims Epichlo & euml; endophytes are vertically transmitted via grass seeds and chemically defend their hosts against herbivory. Endophyte-conferred plant defence via alkaloid biosynthesis might occur independently of costs for host plant growth. However, fitness consequences of endophyte-conferred defence and transgenerational effects on herbivore resistance of progeny plants are rarely studied. The aim of this study was to test whether severe defoliation in mother plants affects their seed production, seed germination rate and the endophyte-conferred resistance of progeny plants.Methods In a field study, we tested the effects of defoliation and endophyte symbiosis (Epichlo & euml; uncinata) on host plant (Festuca pratensis) performance, loline alkaloid concentrations in leaves and seeds, seed biomass and seed germination rates. In a subsequent greenhouse study, we challenged the progeny of the plants from the field study to aphid herbivory and tested whether defoliation of mother plants affects endophyte-conferred resistance against aphids in progeny plants.Key Results Defoliation of the mother plants resulted in a reduction of alkaloid concentrations in leaves and elevated the alkaloid concentrations in seeds when compared with non-defoliated endophyte-symbiotic plants. Viability and germination rate of seeds of defoliated endophyte-symbiotic plants were significantly lower compared with those of non-defoliated endophyte-symbiotic plants and endophyte-free (defoliated and non-defoliated) plants. During 6 weeks of growth, seedlings of defoliated endophyte-symbiotic mother plants had elevated alkaloid concentrations, which was negatively correlated with aphid performance.Conclusions Endophyte-conferred investment in higher alkaloid levels in seeds, elicited by defoliation, provided protection from herbivores in progenies during the first weeks of plant establishment. Better protection of seeds via high alkaloid concentrations was negatively correlated with seed germination, indicating a trade-off between protection and viability.","Fuchs, B; Damerau, A; Yang, BR; Muola, A",ANNALS OF BOTANY,2024,10.1093/aob/mcae133,0.938738297086278,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991059182078915,0.00894081792108459,0.999999103832036,8.96167963948535e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
1087,Hormonal and physiological changes driven by fungal endophytes increase Antarctic plant performance under UV-B radiation,"Antarctic environments are amongst the most stressful habitats for life on Earth, with high intensities of solar UV-B radiation reaching the land surface. In this study, we evaluated how the photochemical efficiency, cell damage and reproductive biomass of Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis) were affected by different intensities of UV-B radiation in the absence and presence of fungal endophytes. In addition, we evaluated the hormonal content of plants at different UV-B radiation intensities and how hormonal content was affected by endophytes. Overall, plants exposed to UV-B radiation showed higher numbers of flowers, higher total biomass and lower lipid peroxidation in the presence of endophytes compared with plants without endophytes. Photochemical efficiency was unaffected. Fungal endophytes affected the content of salicylic acid, jasmonate, indole-3-acetate and abscisic acid in shoot tissue of plants exposed to UV-B radiation. These results suggest that endophytes could modulate the hormonal content of C quitensis to improve its ecophysiological performance under high UV-B radiation.

9288,Biotransformation of Host Plant Flavonoids by the Fungal Endophyte Epicoccum nigrum,"Fermentation of the fungus Epicoccum nigrum isolated from leaves of Salix sp. on green lentil solid medium yielded the flavonol kaempferol (3) as well as two kaempferol O-diglyco-sides (1 and 2) including the new compound 1. The fungal flavonoids bear strong structural similarities to kaempferol derivatives such as kaempferol O-glycoside (4) being present in green lentils. Furthermore, feeding experiments were conducted by adding flavonoids (kaempferol and rutin) as precursors to solid rice media followed by HPLC and LC-MS analyses. Fermentation of the fungus on flavonoid free solid rice medium afforded flavonoid free extracts indicating that the fungal flavonoids originate through hydrolytic cleavage of kaempferol glycosides such as 4 followed by glycosylation and acetylation. This study suggests that E. nigrum is capable of biotransformation reactions of plant derived flavonoids whereas de novo biosynthesis of flavonoids is less likely.","Harwoko, H; Hartmann, R; Daletos, G; Ancheeva, E; Frank, M; Liu, Z; Proksch, P",CHEMISTRYSELECT,2019,10.1002/slct.201903168,0.897202507089134,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999920883438621,7.91165613791166e-5,0.999999999830445,1.69554925655291e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
19752,Soybean Root Nodule and Rhizosphere Microbiome: Distribution of Rhizobial and Nonrhizobial Endophytes.,"Soybean root nodules are known to contain a high diversity of both rhizobial endophytes and nonrhizobial endophytes (NREs). Nevertheless, the variation of these bacteria among different root nodules within single plants has not been reported. So far, it is unclear whether the selection of NREs among different root nodules within single plants is a random process or is strictly controlled by the host plant to favor a few specific NREs based on their beneficial influence on plant growth. As well, it is also unknown if the relative frequency of NREs within different root nodules is consistent or if it varies based on the location or size of a root nodule. We assessed the microbiomes of 193 individual soybean root nodules from nine plants using high-throughput DNA sequencing. Bradyrhizobium japonicum strains occurred in high abundance in all root nodules despite the presence of other soybean-compatible rhizobia, such as Ensifer, Mesorhizobium, and other species of Bradyrhizobium in soil. Nitrobacter and Tardiphaga were the two nonrhizobial genera that were uniformly detected within almost all root nodules, though they were in low abundance. DNA sequences related to other NREs that have frequently been reported, such as Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium, and Variovorax species, were detected in a few nodules. Unlike for Bradyrhizobium, the low abundance and inconsistent occurrence of previously reported NREs among different root nodules within single plants suggest that these microbes are not preferentially selected as endophytes by host plants and most likely play a limited part in plant growth as endophytes.IMPORTANCE Soybean (Glycine max L.) is a valuable food crop that also contributes significantly to soil nitrogen by developing a symbiotic association with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. Bacterial endophytes (both rhizobial and nonrhizobial) are considered critical for the growth and resilience of the legume host. In the past, several studies have suggested that the selection of bacterial endophytes within root nodules can be influenced by factors such as soil pH, nutrient availability, host plant genotype, and bacterial diversity in soil. However, the influence of size or location of root nodules on the selection of bacterial endophytes within soybean roots is unknown. It is also unclear whether the selection of nonrhizobial endophytes within different root nodules of a single plant is a random process or is strictly regulated by the host. This information can be useful in identifying potential bacterial species for developing bioinoculants that can enhance plant growth and soil nitrogen.",Mayhood P; Mirza BS,Applied and environmental microbiology,2021,10.1128/AEM.02884-20,0.968962146171726,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.945516711285099,0.0544832887149013,0.99999802413271,1.97586729022703e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

8876,Biocontrol of Pythium root rot on lisianthus using a new dark septate endophytic fungus Hyaloscypha variabilis J1PC1,"Pythium root rot is one of the most destructive diseases on lisianthus in Japan. Current management strategies against Pythium root rot are insufficient in controlling the disease especially on hydroponically grown lisianthus. This study aimed to explore the potential of dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungi to suppress the root rot disease caused by Pythium irregulare. Among the 10 DSE screened for their pathogenicity on lisianthus, seven DSE produced a positive effect on shoot growth and were thus selected for the first screening in an axenic dual-plate assay. Accordingly, the isolate J1PC1 displayed consistent disease suppression and was thus selected as a final candidate for evaluation in small- and large-scale hydroponic experiments as well as a pot experiment using commercial soil. Shoot disease severity and disease incidence were significantly reduced by J1PC1 treatment compared with that in the untreated control. The control efficacy of J1PC1 reached 50-70%, consequently producing highly marketable lisianthus plants. J1PC1 showed no signs of direct antagonism nor parasitism on P. irregulare, suggesting that other mechanisms might be involved. Real-time PCR using species-specific primers successfully detected J1PC1 from the root tissues even after 3 months of plant treatment. Using cultural, morphological, and internal transcribed spacer-based molecular analysis, J1PC1 was identified as Hyaloscypha variabilis. Collectively, our results strongly indicate that J1PC1 is a promising biocontrol agent for Pythium root rot.","Marian, M; Takashima, Y; Harsonowati, W; Murota, H; Narisawa, K",EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY,2022,10.1007/s10658-022-02459-0,0.935864512026191,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.991542777798042,0.00845722220195823,0.999999999515234,4.84766449204699e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
2671,Endophytic Communities of Transgenic Poplar Were Determined by the Environment and Niche Rather Than by Transgenic Events,"Microbial communities associated with plants represent key determinants of plant health, survival, and growth. However, a good understanding of the structural composition of the bacterial and fungal microbiome present in different plant tissues and growing environments, especially in transgenic woody plants, is required. In the present study, we hypothesized that environmental conditions, ecological niches, and transgenic events could influence the community structure of plant-associated microorganisms (bacterial and fungal endophytes). We sampled the root and stem endospheres of field-grown transgenic and non-transgenic poplar trees (Populus alba x P. berolinensis) and applied 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer amplicon Illumina MiSeq sequencing to determine the bacterial and fungal communities associated with the different plant habitats and tissues. We found that actinobacteria, proteobacteria, bacteroidetes, and firmicutes were the dominant endophytic bacteria, and the fungal community was dominated by dothideomycetes, agaricomycetes, leotiomycetes, and sordariomycetes. In conclusion, transgenic events did not affect the endophytic bacterial and fungal diversity of poplar trees. The bacterial and fungal community structure depends on the pH and the soil organic matter content. Each plant tissue represents a unique ecological niche for the microbial communities. Finally, we identified the indicator operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and core microbiome associated with the different plant tissues of Populus and different environmental conditions. The results provide a basis for further study of host-microbial interactions with the identified abundant OTUs of Populus.","Wang, YB; Zhang, WX; Ding, CJ; Zhang, BY; Huang, QJ; Huang, RF; Su, XH",FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY,2019,10.3389/fmicb.2019.00588,0.960293607081293,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999725293947383,2.747060526171e-4,0.999999197641747,8.02358252949276e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18212,Bioprospecting of South African Plants as a Unique Resource for Bioactive Endophytic Microbes.,"South Africa has a long history and strong belief in traditional herbal medicines. Using ethnobotanical knowledge as a lead, a large number of South African medicinal plants have been discovered to possess a wide spectrum of pharmacological properties. In this review, bioprospecting of endophytes is highlighted by following the advantages of the ethnomedicinal approach together with identifying unique medicinal plants where biological activity may be due to endophytes. This review focuses on the current status of South African medicinal plants to motivate the research community to harness the benefits of ethnobotanical knowledge to investigate the presence of endophytic microbes from the most potent South African medicinal plants. The potential chemical diversity and subsequent putative medicinal value of endophytes is deserving of further research. A timely and comprehensive review of literature on recently isolated endophytes and their metabolites was conducted. Worldwide literature from the last 2 years demonstrating the importance of ethnobotanical knowledge as a useful approach to discover endophytic microbes was documented. Information was obtained from scientific databases such as Pubmed, Scopus, Scirus, Google Scholar, Dictionary of Natural Products, Chemical Abstracts Services, official websites, and scientific databases on ethnomedicines. Primary sources such as books, reports, dissertations, and thesises were accessed where available. Recently published information on isolated endophytes with promising bioactivity and their bioactive natural products worldwide (2015-2017) was summarized. The potential value of South African medicinal plants as sources of endophytes is discussed. The insights provided through this study indicate that medicinal plants in South Africa are highly under-investigated sources of potentially useful endophytic microbes. New approaches may be used by medicinal plant scientists for further exploration of natural products from endophytic fungi and bacteria in southern Africa.",Abdalla MA; McGaw LJ,Frontiers in pharmacology,2018,10.3389/fphar.2018.00456,0.993101495586523,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.754608982145887,0.245391017854113,0.99998343599827,1.65640017295576e-5,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
17227,First Report of Powdery Mildew Caused by Podosphaera xanthii on Verbena brasiliensis in Korea.,"Verbena brasiliensis Vell., commonly known as Brazilian verbena, is native to South America and has been introduced into North America, coastal Europe, southern Africa, and Australasia. Though partly cultivated for garden use, it is invasive in riverine areas and also on roadsides, forest margins, pastures, and waste areas (4). In Korea, this plant was first reported in 1998 in Jeju Island and has become widely naturalized by replacing indigenous plants and disrupting native ecosystems in most of southern part of Korea (3). Since 2009, powdery mildew on Brazilian verbena has been consistently found in several locations of Busan City, Korea. Symptoms appeared as circular to irregular white patches, which subsequently showed abundant hyphal growth on both sides of the leaves and on stems. High disease severity caused poor growth of the plants, resulting in premature senescence and reduced flowering. Specimens (n = 5) were deposited in the Korea University Herbarium (KUS). Appressoria on the mycelium were nipple-shaped or nearly absent. Conidiophores were 140 to 190 × 11 to 12.5 μm and produced 2 to 7 immature conidia in chains with a crenate outline. Foot-cells in conidiophores were straight, cylindric, relatively short, 50 to 65 μm long, and constricted at the very base of branching point from the hypha. Conidia were hyaline, ellipsoid to ovate, measured 28 to 38 × 18.5 to 22 μm (length/width ratio of 1.2 to 1.8), and contained distinct fibrosin bodies. Germ tubes were produced from the lateral position of conidia. No chasmothecia were observed. These structures are typical of the powdery mildew Euoidium anamorph of the genus Podosphaera. The morphological characteristics and measurements were consistent with those of P. xanthii (Castagne) U. Braun & Shishkoff (1). To confirm the identity, the complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA of the isolate KUS-F27220 was amplified with primers ITS1/ITS4, and sequenced. The resulting 477-bp sequence was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. KJ472787). A GenBank BLAST search of this sequence revealed 100% identity with Podosphaera sp. on V. bonariensis and V.× hybrida from Japan (AB462804 and AB040347). The Podosphaera sp. isolates listed above are now placed in P. xanthii (1). Pathogenicity was confirmed through inoculation by gently pressing a diseased leaf onto leaves of three healthy, potted 2-month-old Brazilian verbena plants. Three non-inoculated plants served as controls. Inoculated plants developed signs and symptoms after 6 days, whereas the control plants remained symptomless. The fungus present on the inoculated leaves was identical morphologically to that originally observed on diseased plants. Powdery mildew of Verbena spp. associated with Podosphaera sp. (including Sphaerotheca sp.) has been globally reported, but not on V. brasiliensis (1,2). To our knowledge, this is the first report of powdery mildew disease caused by P. xanthii on V. brasiliensis globally. Our field observations suggest that the powdery mildew could limit expansion of V. brasiliensis in Korea. References: (1) U. Braun and R. T. A. Cook.

12020,Biocontrol activity of an endophytic Alternaria alternata Aa-Lcht against apple Valsa canker,"Apple Valsa canker (AVC), caused by Valsa mali, is the most serious branch disease for apples in East Asia. Biocontrol constitutes a desirable alternative strategy to alleviate the problems of orchard environment pollution and pathogen resistance risk. It is particularly important to explore efficient biocontrol microorganism resources to develop new biocontrol technologies and products. In this study, an endophytic fungus, which results in the specific inhibition of the growth of V. mali, was isolated from the twig tissue of Malus micromalus with a good tolerance to AVC. The fungus was identified as Alternaria alternata, based on morphological observations and phylogenetic analysis, and was named Aa-Lcht. Aa-Lcht showed a strong preventive effect against AVC, as determined with an in vitro twig evaluation method. When V. mali was inhibited by Aa-Lcht, according to morphological and cytological observations, the hyphae was deformed and it had more branches, a degradation in protoplasm, breakages in cell walls, and then finally died completely due to mycelium cells. Transcriptome analysis indicated that Aa-Lcht could suppress the growth of V. mali by inhibiting the activity of various hydrolases, destroying carbohydrate metabolic processes, and damaging the pathogen membrane system. It was further demonstrated that Aa-Lcht could colonize apple twig tissues without damaging the tissue's integrity. More importantly, Aa-Lcht could also stimulate the up-regulated expression of defense-related genes in apples together with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and callose deposition in apple leaf cells. Summarizing the above, one endophytic biocontrol resource was isolated, and it can colonize apple twig tissue and play a biocontrol role through both pathogen inhibition and resistance inducement.","He, YT; Tian, RZ; Gao, CY; Ji, L; Liu, X; Feng, H; Huang, LL",PESTICIDE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY,2024,10.1016/j.pestbp.2024.105813,0.91815526446992,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.962963539293514,0.0370364607064863,0.999999998862814,1.1371864561127202e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
3015,Wood-rotting basidiomycetes are a minor component of fungal communities associated with Acacia hybrid trees grown for sawlogs in South Vietnam,"Acacia hybrid (Acacia mangium x Acacia auriculiformis) clones are widely planted in Vietnam with a total of approximately 400,000ha to meet the demand for pulpwood, sawn timber and wood chip exports. Silvicultural techniques such as pruning and thinning have been applied to improve productivity and sawlog quality of Acacia hybrid plantations. However, those techniques may also create opportunities for wood decay fungi to enter the Acacia hybrid stems through wounds and cause stem defects that reduce sawlog quality and the value of the plantation. The presence of fungal decay agents in Acacia hybrid trees was examined in two Vietnamese plantations. In July 2011, just prior to a second thinning, discoloured wood samples were taken from a three-year-old Acacia hybrid plantation at Phan Truong Hai for the isolation of fungi. In July 2012, approximately 18months after pruning and thinning treatments, discoloured wood samples were taken from a three-year-old Acacia hybrid plantation at Nghia Trung for the isolation of fungi. DNA sequencing of the rDNA ITS identified the isolates. In May 2015, approximately 4years after thinning and fertilizer treatments, discoloured and decayed wood samples were taken from the above (7-year-old) Acacia hybrid plantation at Phan Truong Hai for fungal identification. DNA was extracted directly from discoloured and decayed wood samples and fungal rDNA ITS amplicons sequenced on a Roche 454 sequencer. The results showed that silvicultural treatments did not affect the fungal communities associated with discoloured and decayed wood of Acacia hybrid plantation at Phan Truong Hai. A total of 135 fungal species or OTUs (operational taxonomic units) were identified, including 82 members of Ascomycota and 52 Basidiomycota.","Tran, TT; Glen, M; Beadle, C; Ratkowsky, D; Mohammed, C",FOREST PATHOLOGY,2019,10.1111/efp.12498,0.894487104444273,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.951530376503378,0.0484696234966218,0.99961003922246106,3.8996077753927e-4,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
16938,First Report of Myrothecium roridum Causing Myrothecium Leaf Spot on Salvia spp. in the United States.,"The genus Salvia includes at least 900 species distributed worldwide. Wild species are found in South America, southern Europe, northern Africa, and North America. Salvia, commonly referred to as sage, is grown commercially as a landscape plant. In August 2006, pale-to-dark brown, circular leaf spots 5 to 20 mm in diameter with concentric rings were observed on Salvia farinacea 'Victoria Blue'. Approximately 5% of the plants in a central Florida nursery were affected. Lesions were visible on both leaf surfaces, and black sporodochia with white, marginal hyphal tuffs were present mostly on the lower surface in older lesions. Symptoms were consistent with those of Myrothecium leaf spot described on other ornamentals such as gardenia, begonia, and New Guinea impatiens (4). Isolations from lesions on potato dextrose agar produced white, floccose colonies with sporodochia in dark green-to-black concentric rings. Conidia were hyaline and cylindrical with rounded ends and averaged 7.4 × 2.0 μm. All characteristics were consistent with the description of Myrothecium roridum Tode ex Fr. (2,3). The internal transcribed spacer regions ITS1, ITS2, and the 5.8s rRNA genomic region of one isolate were sequenced (Accession No. EF151002) and compared with sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. Deposited sequences from M. roridum were 96.3 to 98.8% homologous to the isolate from salvia. To confirm pathogenicity, three salvia plants were inoculated by spraying with a conidial suspension of M. roridum (1 × 105 conidia per ml). Plants were covered with plastic bags and incubated in a growth chamber at 28°C for 7 days. Three plants were sprayed with sterile, distilled water as a control and incubated similarly. The symptoms described above were observed in all inoculated plants after 7 days, while control plants remained symptomless. M. roridum was reisolated consistently from symptomatic tissue. There are more than 150 hosts of M. roridum, including one report on Salvia spp. in Brunei (1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of Myrothecium leaf spot caused by M. roridum on Salvia spp. in the United States. Even the moderate level disease present caused damage to the foliage and reduced the marketability of salvia plants. Therefore, control measures may need to be implemented for production of this species in ornamental nurseries. References: (1) D. F. Farr et al. Fungal Databases.

Incidence and intensity were low during summer, increased to a maximum in winter, and then declined in spring. A second endophyte, Acremonium lolii Latch, Christensen and Samuels was also present in most plants, but its incidence and intensity became greatest as the Gliocladium-like endophyte declined. Hyphae of the Gliocladium-like endophyte occurred in intercellular spaces of the leaf sheath, and less profusely of the leaf blade, assuming swollen or contorted forms during the period of highest intensity of infection in winter. At this time, sporodochia of the Gliocladium-like endophyte protruded through the stomata of leaf blades whose tissues were beginning to degenerate.

18577,Hypericin in the Light and in the Dark: Two Sides of the Same Coin.,"Hypericin (4,5,7,4',5',7'-hexahydroxy-2,2'-dimethylnaphtodianthrone) is a naturally occurring chromophore found in some species of the genus Hypericum, especially Hypericum perforatum L. (St. John's wort), and in some basidiomycetes (Dermocybe spp.) or endophytic fungi (Thielavia subthermophila). In recent decades, hypericin has been intensively studied for its broad pharmacological spectrum. Among its antidepressant and light-dependent antiviral actions, hypericin is a powerful natural photosensitizer that is applicable in the photodynamic therapy (PDT) of various oncological diseases. As the accumulation of hypericin is significantly higher in neoplastic tissue than in normal tissue, it can be used in photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) as an effective fluorescence marker for tumor detection and visualization. In addition, light-activated hypericin acts as a strong pro-oxidant agent with antineoplastic and antiangiogenic properties, since it effectively induces the apoptosis, necrosis or autophagy of cancer cells. Moreover, a strong affinity of hypericin for necrotic tissue was discovered. Thus, hypericin and its radiolabeled derivatives have been recently investigated as potential biomarkers for the non-invasive targeting of tissue necrosis in numerous disorders, including solid tumors. On the other hand, several light-independent actions of hypericin have also been described, even though its effects in the dark have not been studied as intensively as those of photoactivated hypericin. Various experimental studies have revealed no cytotoxicity of hypericin in the dark; however, it can serve as a potential antimetastatic and antiangiogenic agent. On the contrary, hypericin can induce the expression of some ABC transporters, which are often associated with the multidrug resistance (MDR) of cancer cells. Moreover, the hypericin-mediated attenuation of the cytotoxicity of some chemotherapeutics was revealed. Therefore, hypericin might represent another St. John's wort metabolite that is potentially responsible for negative herb-drug interactions. The main aim of this review is to summarize the benefits of photoactivated and non-activated hypericin, mainly in preclinical and clinical applications, and to uncover the ""dark side"" of this secondary metabolite, focusing on MDR mechanisms.",Jendželovská Z; Jendželovský R; Kuchárová B; Fedoročko P,Frontiers in plant science,2016,10.3389/fpls.2016.00560,0.957387020946291,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.880580471810365,0.119419528189635,0.999975461104564,2.45388954356329e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

8580,Enhanced nitrogen and phosphorus activation with an optimized bacterial community by endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambari in paddy soil,"The endophytic fungus Phomopsis liquidambari play a key role in habitat adaptation of rice (Oryza saliva L.) with potential multiple beneficial. However, our previous published work on this subject remains incomplete. Here, we performed a soil nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) transformation with related functional genes and elucidated how rhizosphere microbiota vary their response to P. liquidambari interaction throughout the plant's life cycle under field conditions by Illumina Miseq sequencing platforms in a nutrient-limited paddy soil. Our results showed that P. liquidambari symbiosis decreased the nitrogen and phosphorus loss by 24.59% and 17.46% per pot, respectively. Additionally, we suggest that the application of P. liquidambari altered the activation of soil nitrogen and phosphorus functional genes to accelerate nutrient turnover in the rice rhizosphere. High-throughput sequencing with co-occurrence network and species-related network analysis further revealed that P. liquidambari colonization influenced the patterns of microbiota shift in the rhizosphere, especially during the heading stages. This led to an optimized microbial community through the promotion and inhibition of indigenous soil microbes with a higher level of available nutrient supplies. Our study strongly proposes rice-P. liquidambari symbiosis as a useful candidate for improving N and P acquisition and utilization.","Tang, MJ; Zhu, Q; Zhang, FM; Zhang, W; Yuan, J; Sun, K; Xu, FJ; Dai, CC",MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH,2019,10.1016/j.micres.2019.02.005,0.975144387432783,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.998540635230277,0.00145936476972291,0.999999990308445,9.691554780921761e-9,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
12656,"Rapid temporal changes in root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and fine root endophytes, not dark septate endophytes, track plant activity and environment in an alpine ecosystem","Fungal root endophytes play an important role in plant nutrition, helping plants acquire nutrients in exchange for photosynthates. We sought to characterize the progression of root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), dark septate endophytes (DSE), and fine root endophytes (FRE) over an alpine growing season, and to understand the role of the host plant and environment in driving colonization levels. We sampled four forbs on a regular schedule from June 26th-September 11th from a moist meadow (3535 m a.s.l) on Niwot Ridge, Rocky Mountain Front Range, CO, USA. We quantified the degree of root colonization by storage structures, exchange structures, and hyphae of all three groups of fungi. AMF and FRE percent colonization fluctuated significantly over time, while DSE did not. All AMF structures changed over time, and the degree of change in vesicles differed by plant species. FRE hyphae, AMF arbuscules and AMF vesicles peaked late in the season as plants produced seeds. AMF hyphae levels started high, decreased, and then increased within 20 days, highlighting the dynamic nature of plant-fungal interactions. Overall, our results show that AMF and FRE, not DSE, root colonization rapidly changes over the course of a growing season and these changes are driven by plant phenology and seasonal changes in the environment.","de Mesquita, CPB; del Río, CMM; Suding, KN; Schmidt, SK",MYCORRHIZA,2018,10.1007/s00572-018-0863-7,0.945937628599604,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999913799885097,8.62001149029019e-5,0.999999999999465,5.349054532643999e-13,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
18907,Wild again: recovery of a beneficial Cannabis seed endophyte from low domestication genotypes.,"Beyond carrying the plant embryo, seeds harbour intricate microbial communities whose transmission across successive plant generations can significantly influence the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of plant-microbe symbioses. The process of plant domestication has potential repercussions in genes involved in plant-microbiome interactions. However, the extent to which breeding can impact the seed microbiome is sparsely explored. Cannabis is a high-value crop but sparsely subjected to agricultural innovations established in other crop species during the last century. Here, we conduct a large-scale analysis of the bacterial seed microbiome of Cannabis across different domestication grades and investigate the potential of seed-associated endophytes as plant growth-promoting agents under both controlled and field conditions. Analysis of Cannabis seed endophyte composition and diversity across 46 plant genotypes revealed 813 different bacterial genera with a predominance of Gammaproteobacteria, Bacilli, Actinobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria but a genotype-specific microbiome. The assessment of domestication and breeding on microbial assembly revealed a higher bacterial diversity in low domestication genotypes (Shannon index, H': 1.21 vs. 1.05) and a higher homogeneity in bacterial composition caused by line development. Further, a seed bacterial isolate (Bacillus frigoritolerans C1141) associated with low domestication genotypes, and with genes associated with bio-fertilization, bioremediation and phytohormone production, increased plant growth by 42.3% at the time of harvest, under field conditions. This study addresses critical knowledge gaps related to the assembly of the Cannabis seed-endophytic microbiome.

10306,The interplay of symbiotic beings in the Pampa: the encounter between an alien grass and leaf-cutting ants,"Symbiotic relationships across trophic levels influence invasions. Although Epichlo & euml; endophytes are often linked to forage grasses spread through alkaloid-mediated herbivore resistance, this link oversimplifies a complex, multifactorial process. We investigate whether this fungal endophyte interacts with the fungus garden of the native leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex ambiguus by inducing the release of a widespread green leaf volatile, thereby altering its foraging behavior. We conducted 5-d choice experiments to assess ant preferences for leaves and seeds of Lolium multiflorum plants, either infected (E+) or uninfected (E-) with Epichlo & euml; occultans, along with a Petri dish assay to evaluate the effects of (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate (Z3-HAC) on the growth of Leucoagaricus gongylophorus, ants' mutualistic fungi. Ants exhibited delayed rejection for E+ plants while showing no preference for seeds. In vitro, Z3-HAC promoted fungal growth away from volatile sources. These findings suggest that mutualistic fungi of a grass (alien) and its herbivore (native) shape their defense strategies in Pampean grasslands. Z3-HAC's effects extend beyond direct plant-herbivore interactions, signaling antagonistic fungi within the fungal garden without acting as a novel weapon. This study highlights the importance of integrating microbial networks into invasion ecology frameworks to understand the consequences of co-introduced plants and symbionts.","Fernández, PC; Minás, A; Omacini, M",NEW PHYTOLOGIST,2025,10.1111/nph.70333,0.8696053577119,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.89279866996772,0.10720133003228,0.999987715197479,1.22848025210232e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
1246,Are endophytes an important link between airborne spores and allergen exposure?,"Grasses represent one of the Earth's most common plant groups, and natural and cultivated habitats dominated by grasses cover about 40% of the land surface. In turn, each grass species hosts multiple fungal species which can behave as endophytes. An analysis of the endophytic taxa identified in surveys conducted in 14 grass species showed that some of the most frequent taxa on each grass were also present across several host grasses. These taxa were Alternaria, Epicoccum, Cladosporium, Fusarium, and a few others. A similar analysis of airborne fungi surveyed at 41 different locations throughout the world showed that some of the most geographically widespread, and most locally frequent airborne fungi belonged to the same genera that are dominant endophytes in grasses (i.e. Cladosporium, Alternaria, Fusarium, etc.). Therefore, airborne spores of genera that are ubiquitous in grasses are common worldwide and attain high atmospheric concentrations. In addition, spores of the above mentioned fungi are also important respiratory allergens. Direct observation indicates that saprobic colonization and sporulation of non-systemic grass endophytes could become unrestrained when their host plant tissue dies. Subsequently, when appropriate environmental conditions favour sporulation on grass host surfaces, the natural cycle for airborne conidia initiates, and large numbers of these conidia disperse as inoculum for new endophytic infections. Therefore, the cycle of endophytism may be an important link between climate, plant biology and public health.","de Aldana, BRV; Bills, G; Zabalgogeazcoa, I",FUNGAL DIVERSITY,2013,10.1007/s13225-013-0223-z,0.953083448385368,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.987431465619461,0.0125685343805389,0.999999999651108,3.48891693313647e-10,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
6419,Chemical analysis and anticancer activity of sesterterpenoid from an endophytic fungus Hypomontagnella monticulosa Zg15SU and its host Zingiber griffithii Baker,"Zingiber griffithii Baker is one of the native Zingiberaceous species in a tropical forest of North Sumatra, Indonesia. Zingiberaceous species have been intensively studied and reported as herbal ingredients in ethnomedicine and currently their endophytic fungal associates were studied for pharmacological importance. Fifteen endophytic fungi were isolated from Zingiber griffithii following morphological and molecular characterization. All isolates exhibited antibacterial properties to at least one of the tested pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Methicilin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). The isolate, identified as Hypomontagnella monticulosa strain Zg15SU (syn. Hypoxylon monticulosum Mont.) based on its rDNA/ITS sequence, displayed antibacterial activities to all tested pathogens. The EtOAc extract of the H. monticulosum Zg15SU showed the highest activity for gram-negative bacteria, the E. coli and EPEC, while the extract of Z. griffithii rhizome displayed activity only for E. coli. The gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (GC-MS) indicated a major portion of similar compounds found in both the endophytic fungus and plant extract, revealing the compounds of oleic acid, cyclononasiloxane, octadecamethyl, and eicosanoic acid Furthermore, purification and structural elucidation on the EtOAc extract of both Z. griffithii rhizome and H. monticulosa Zg15SU yielded two bioactive compounds: a novel compound, griffithiiene, a terpenoid-alkaloid bearing the skeleton of a scalarane (1) and scalaradial (2) which were confirmed by H-1- (500 MHz) and C-13- NMR (125 MHz) spectroscopy. Importantly, the elucidated compounds showed a cytotoxicity activity against cancer cell lines, the Panc-1, NBT-T2, and HCT116 based on in vitro MTT proliferation assay. This is the first report of Z. griffithii harboring an endophytic fungus, H. monticulosa, which produced potential antibacterial and anticancer metabolites along with its host to be utilized for future prospects.","Lutfia, A; Munir, E; Yurnaliza, Y; Basyuni, M",HELIYON,2021,10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06292,0.979741924348107,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.999586344427333,4.1365557266697e-4,0.999999999999953,4.6518344731794103e-14,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence

Four common species of seed-borne fungi namely, Penicillium decumbens, Penicillium namyslowskii, Lichtheimia corymbifera, and Aspergillus niger were found to grow in choy sum in southern China. A novel finding was that P. decumbens had the greatest inhibition of the germination of Choy sum seeds, resulting in a non- germination rate exceeding 62.8%. The existing standardized seed sterilization treatment failed to completely kill P. decumbens, so a way to nondestructively identify and filter out P. decumbens-infected seeds wereevolved is urgently needed. Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy-based partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model achieved a discrimination accuracy of 95% in on-line nondestructive detection of P. decumbens-infected choy sum seeds.

12856,Unraveling the role of dark septate endophytes and extracellular polymeric substances in soil aggregate formation and alfalfa growth enhancement,"The ecological restoration of mining regions presents significant scientific challenges, particularly concerning poor soil structure and the difficulty of retaining water and nutrients. Dark septate endophytes (DSE) are known to improve soil structure and promote plant growth, yet the precise mechanisms which they operate remain inadequately understood. In this study, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) were extracted from the metabolites of the DSE (Alternaria sp. 17,463) to evaluate their synergistic impact on plant growth when applied as a soil amendment in conjunction with the DSE strain. The application of 0.25 % EPS increased soil water retention by 11.02 % and stimulated root development by enhancing soil enzyme activity, overall soil metabolism, and nutrient availability. Particularly, the alterations in enzyme activities and nutrient availability within small macro-aggregates were crucial in supporting alfalfa growth. The combined effect of DSE and EPS significantly enhanced soil structure and alfalfa root development, resulting in a remarkable 4.04-fold increase in total biomass. Therefore, these findings provided a theoretical basis for the large-scale application of ecological restoration and microbial technologies.","Bi, YL; Tan, H; Zhang, SS; Zhao, J",RHIZOSPHERE,2025,10.1016/j.rhisph.2025.101093,0.803287305388682,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.832973894009777,0.167026105990223,0.999999884150174,1.15849825510494e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
8712,The Effect of Mycorrhizal Inoculum and Phosphorus Treatment on Growth and Flowering of Ajania (Ajania pacifica (Nakai) Bremer et Humphries) Plant,"The influence of mycorrhizal inoculum in combination with different phosphorus treatments on growth and flowering parameters of Ajania (Ajania pacifica (Nakai) Bremer et Humphries) plants was investigated in two growing seasons (2015 and 2016). Plants of the cultivar 'Silver and Gold' were transplanted into pots either with added mycorrhizal inoculum or without inoculum and assigned to four phosphorus treatments. Mycorrhizal colonization was assessed by evaluating the frequency of colonization, intensity of colonization and density of fungal structures (arbuscules, vesicles, coils and microsclerotia) in the roots. During the growing season, the content of plant available phosphorus in the soil was analyzed, and shoot length, number of shoots, number of inflorescences, number of flowers and flowering time were evaluated. Inoculated Ajania plants were successfully colonized with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophytic fungi. In the root segments, hyphae were mainly observed, as well as vesicles, coils, arbuscules and microsclerotia, but in lower density. The density of fungal structures did not differ among phosphorus treatments, but did differ between years, with a higher density of fungal structures in 2016. Mycorrhizal plants developed higher number of shoots in 2016, higher number of inflorescences, higher number of flowers, and they flowered longer compared to uninoculated plants.","Vosnjak, M; Likar, M; Osterc, G",HORTICULTURAE,2021,10.3390/horticulturae7070178,0.972166715546989,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.865206837926723,0.134793162073277,0.999999872272611,1.27727388776755e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
934,Fungal root endophyte associations of medicinal plants,"Fungal root endophytes were examined in 25 medicinal plant species from 24 genera and 14 families. Arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) was found in 15 species. In roots of these plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM F) with coarse hyphae were dominant. The intensity of AMF colonization varied with particular species, ranging from 1.2% (Cannabis sativa) to 78.8% (Salvia przewalskii). The fine AM endophyte (Glomus tenue) hyphae were found only in 3 species. The AM morphology of 12 species was of the Arum-type, while 3 plants of the Apiaceae and Cannabaceae families revealed intermediate AM types. The mycelium of dark septate endophytes (DSE) was observed in 17 plant species; however, both the frequency of their occurrence in roots and the intensity of root colonization were low. The sporadic occurrence of Olpidium spp. sporangia was also observed in 5 plant species. Spores of 6 AMF species (Glomeromycota) were isolated from trap cultures established with soils collected from beneath the plants under study, namely Albahypha drummondii, Claroideoglomus claroideum, Funneliformis caledonius, Funneliformis mosseae, Paraglomus majewskii, and Septoglomus constriction. The fungus most frequently found was F. mosseae, which also sporulated most abundantly in the cultures. In contrast, A. drummondii and F. caledonius were detected only in single cultures. Additionally, one morphotype with glomoid spores resembling those of Diversispora spp. was isolated from a single culture. The results constitute the first detailed report of the root endophyte associations of these plant species.

18470,A Review of Perennial Ryegrass Endophytes and Their Potential Use in the Management of African Black Beetle in Perennial Grazing Systems in Australia.,"The major insect pest of Australian cool temperate pastures is the root-feeding insect Heteronychus arator (African black beetle, ABB). Significant pasture damage can occur even at low ABB densities (11 individuals per square meter), and often re-sowing of the whole paddock is required. Mitigation of the effects of pasture pests, and in particular subterranean species such as the larval form of ABB, can be challenging. Early detection is limited by the ability to visualize above-ground symptoms, and chemical control of insects in soil is often ineffective. This review takes a look at the historical events that molded the pastoral landscape in Australia. The importation route, changes in land management and pasture composition by European settlers may have aided the establishment of ABB in Australia. Perennial ryegrass Lolium perenne is discussed as it is one of the most important perennial agricultural grasses and is widely-sown in moderate-to-high-rainfall temperate zones of the world. Endophytic fungi from the genus Epichloë form symbiotic relationships with cool season grasses such as Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass). They have been studied extensively and are well documented for enhancing persistence in pasture via a suite of bioactive secondary metabolites produced by the fungal symbionts. Several well-characterized secondary metabolites are discussed. Some can have negative effects on cattle (e.g., ergovaline and lolitrems) while others have been shown to benefit the host plant through deterrence of insect pests from feeding and by insecticidal activity (e.g., peramine, lolines, ergopeptines). Various control methods for ABB are also discussed, with a focus on the potential role of asexual Epichloë endophytes.",Karpyn Esqueda M; Yen AL; Rochfort S; Guthridge KM; Powell KS; Edwards J; Spangenberg GC,Frontiers in plant science,2017,10.3389/fpls.2017.00003,0.991066090071403,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.82395601111359,0.17604398888641,0.999983765336997,1.62346630028232e-5,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence

3552,Deciphering the relative importance of soil and plant traits on the development of rhizosphere microbial communities,"Rhizosphere microbes are critical for plant growth and vitality, but the structure of the root-associated microbial community varies due to site-specific soil factors and plant traits. Here, we investigated how soil type and plant species affect the rhizosphere microbial community. Soil types were collected from a rice field or a secondary forest. Each soil was planted with either pathogen-inoculated or un-inoculated seeds of Fusarium wilt-susceptible (watermelon and cucumber) or Fusarium wilt-resistant (celery) crops. Analysis of the rhizosphere microbial communities revealed differences in the same crop that was planted on different soil types, as well as between crops grown on the same soil type. Thus, there are soil-specific and plant species-specific factors that determine the rhizosphere microbial community structure. However, we found that the plant species effect on microbial community structure (explaining 18.1% of the variance in bacterial species and 13.3% of variance in fungal species) was less than the soil type effect (variance explained: 47.1% for bacteria, 29.2% for fungi). Notably, soil NF4+-N concentration was the most influential soil-specific factor affecting rhizosphere microbial community composition. The rhizosphere of each plant species harbored core and unique microbes that were different in their relative abundance and composition. The pathogen-inoculated plants had a similar rhizosphere microbial community as those that were not inoculated with Fusarium wilt-causing fungus, although there was an increase in the relative abundances of microbial genera associated with biological disease control and maintenance of plant health. We conclude that the rhizosphere microbial community structure is determined more by soil type than the plant species cultivated in that soil.","Liu, LL; Huang, XQ; Zhang, JB; Cai, ZC; Jiang, K; Chang, YY",SOIL BIOLOGY & BIOCHEMISTRY,2020,10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.107909,0.974467743002944,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.97511268939659,0.0248873106034104,0.999999813427015,1.86572985061417e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
21253,Antimicrobial Activity of Endophytic Fungi Isolated from a Traditionally Important Plant of NE India–Litsea chinensis Lam,"Finding new and effective antimicrobial metabolites has become more important as bacterial pathogens have developed a major resistance to antibiotics. Several active metabolites and their antimicrobial properties have been reported from endophytes isolated from medicinal plants. The goal of the current study was to isolate endophytes from the leaves of Litsea chinensis and assess the antibacterial activity of the crude metabolites produced by these endophytes. The endophytes were isolated from surface-sterilized healthy leaves inoculated on different mycological media – Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA), Host extract+Agar (HEA) and Water Agar (WA). A total of 27 endophytes were isolated from the three distinct media with the highest colonization frequency in WA (50%) media followed by HEA (20%) and PDA (20%) media. The highest fungal colonies were recovered from WA media, whereas more yeast colonies were isolated from PDA and HEA media. The pure cultures of the isolated endophytes were cultured on Potato Dextrose Broth (PDB) and five different isolates were obtained. The crude metabolites of only one of the isolates (LCEA1) showed promising antimicrobial activity against all the test organisms. The isolate LCEA1 was again tested for antimicrobial activity at 14 and 21 days of incubation, with the maximum antibacterial activity reported at 21 days. However, the highest zone of inhibition (18 mm) was observed against MTCC-737 (Staphylococcus aureus) followed by MTCC-736 (Bacillus subtilis) (12 mm) and MTCC-424 (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) (11 mm).

Only the growth of isolate 14E increased at three levels of salinity compared with control. Some isolates, i.e. 7E, 14E, 19E and 26E had higher colony diameter at 45 °C after 48 h of incubation compared to the growth at 30 and 40 °C.

15500,Bacteria associated with wood tissues of Esca-diseased grapevines: functional diversity and synergy with Fomitiporia mediterranea to degrade wood components,"Fungi are considered to cause grapevine trunk diseases such as esca that result in wood degradation. For instance, the basidiomycete Fomitiporia mediterranea (Fmed) is overabundant in white rot, a key type of wood-necrosis associated with esca. However, many bacteria colonize the grapevine wood too, including the white rot. In this study, we hypothesized that bacteria colonizing grapevine wood interact, possibly synergistically, with Fmed and enhance the fungal ability to degrade wood. We isolated 237 bacterial strains from esca-affected grapevine wood. Most of them belonged to the families Xanthomonadaceae and Pseudomonadaceae. Some bacterial strains that degrade grapevine-wood components such as cellulose and hemicellulose did not inhibit Fmed growth in vitro. We proved that the fungal ability to degrade wood can be strongly influenced by bacteria inhabiting the wood. This was shown with a cellulolytic and xylanolytic strain of the Paenibacillus genus, which displays synergistic interaction with Fmed by enhancing the degradation of wood structures. Genome analysis of this Paenibacillus strain revealed several gene clusters such as those involved in the expression of carbohydrate-active enzymes, xylose utilization and vitamin metabolism. In addition, certain other genetic characteristics of the strain allow it to thrive as an endophyte in grapevine and influence the wood degradation by Fmed. This suggests that there might exist a synergistic interaction between the fungus Fmed and the bacterial strain mentioned above, enhancing grapevine wood degradation. Further step would be to point out its occurrence in mature grapevines to promote esca disease development. © 2021 The Authors.

6647,Hydrolytic enzyme production from acai palm (Euterpe precatoria) endophytic fungi and characterization of the amylolytic and cellulolytic extracts,"Enzymes are biocatalysts that are widely used in different industries and generate billions of dollars annually. With the advancement of biotechnology, new enzymatic sources are being evaluated, especially microbial ones, in order to find efficient producers. Endophytic fungi are promising sources of biomolecules; however, Amazonian species are still poorly studied as to their enzymatic production potential. In this sense, the production of hydrolases (amylases, lipases, cellulases and pectinases) was evaluated in endophytic fungi isolated from the leaves, roots and stems of acai palms (Euterpe precatoria). A qualitative test was carried out to detect the enzymatic synthesis in each isolate, and the most promising ones were cultivated using submerged fermentation. The enzyme extracts were quantified to determine those with the greatest activity. Cellulolytic and amylolytic extracts showed the highest enzymatic activities and were partially characterized. Among 50 isolates, 82.9% produced pectinase, 58.5% produced cellulase, 31.7% produced amylase, and 12.2% produced lipase. Penicillium sp. L3 was the best producer of amylase and Colletotrichum sp. S1 was the best producer of cellulase in liquid medium cultivation. The amylolytic extract showed the highest enzymatic activity at pH 8.0 and 45 degrees C, and the cellulolytic extract at pH 5.0 and 35 degrees C. The cellulase and amylase produced by the endophytes had their molecular masses estimated between 38 and 76 kDa. These results indicate that endophytic fungi from the acai palm can be used as a new source of hydrolytic enzymes, which can be applied in numerous biotechnological processes.","Batista, BN; Matias, RR; Oliveira, RLE; Albuquerque, PM",WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY,2022,10.1007/s11274-021-03217-w,0.977118100622982,Relevant,Absence,Presence,Presence,Absence,0.285245891952452,0.714754108047548,0.999993307872821,6.69212717874235e-6,Absence,Absence,Uncertain,Uncertain,Presence,Uncertain
1990,"Root environment is a key determinant of fungal entomopathogen endophytism following seed treatment in the common bean, Phaseolus vulgaris","The common bean is the most important food legume in the world. We examined the potential of the fungal entomopathogens Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae applied as seed treatments for their endophytic establishment in the common bean. Endophytic colonization in sterile sand: peat averaged ca. 40% higher for fungus treatments and ca. six times higher for volunteer fungi (other fungal endophytes naturally occurring in our samples), relative to sterile vermiculite. Colonization by B. bassiana and M. anisopliae was least variable in sterile vermiculite and most variable in sterile soil: sand: peat. The impact of soil sterilization on endophytic colonization was assessed in a separate experiment using six different field-collected soils. Soil sterilization was the variable with the largest impact on colonization (70.8% of its total variance), while the fungal isolate used to inoculate seeds explained 8.4% of the variance. Under natural microbial soil conditions experienced by common bean farmers, seed inoculations with B. bassiana and M. anisopliae are unlikely to yield predictable levels of endophytic colonization.

774,The Co-occurrence and Morphological Continuum Between Ericoid Mycorrhiza and Dark Septate Endophytes in Roots of Six European Rhododendron Species,"Ericaceae associate with a wide spectrum of root mycobionts, but the most common are ascomycetous ericoid mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophytes (DSE), followed by basidiomycetous fungi and glomeracean arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. We investigated distribution and morphological diversity of ericoid mycorrhizae (ErM), DSE associations, ectomycorrhizae (EcM) and arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) in hair roots of six European native Rhododendron species and found that i) while EcM and AM were absent, ErM and DSE associations were simultaneously present in all screened plants; ii) their levels were negatively correlated, suggesting Ericaceae preference for certain root-fungus association in certain habitats; iii) the highest ErM colonization occurred at sites in southern and central Europe, while the highest DSE colonization was found in a subarctic site in northern Finland and in a subalpine site in the Carpathians, suggesting a latitudinal/altitudinal shift in Ericaceae root-fungus associations; iv) some mycelia could simultaneously form structures corresponding to ErM and DSE association, which occasionally resulted in a unique ectendomycorrhizal colonization comprising an intercellular parenchymatous net and intracellular hyphal coils. These results indicate frequent interactions between ErM fungi and DSE in roots of European rhododendrons and a morphological continuum between ErM and DSE associations. The new ectendomycorrhizal type deserves further investigation.","Vohník, M; Albrechtová, J",FOLIA GEOBOTANICA,2011,10.1007/s12224-011-9098-5,0.957256258883249,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.994884771230903,0.0051152287690972,0.999999972260325,2.77396748904479e-8,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence
17011,Transgenic banana plants expressing Xanthomonas wilt resistance genes revealed a stable non-target bacterial colonization structure.,"Africa is among the continents where the battle over genetically modified crops is currently being played out. The impact of GM in Africa could potentially be very positive. In Uganda, researchers have developed transgenic banana lines resistant to banana Xanthomonas wilt. The transgenic lines expressing hrap and pflp can provide a timely solution to the pandemic. However, the impact of the transgenes expression on non-target microorganisms has not yet been investigated. To study this effect, transgenic and control lines were grown under field conditions and their associated microbiome was investigated by 16S rRNA gene profiling combining amplicon sequencing and molecular fingerprinting. Three years after sucker planting, no statistically significant differences between transgenic lines and their non-modified predecessors were detected for their associated bacterial communities. The overall gammaproteobacterial rhizosphere microbiome was highly dominated by Xanthomonadales, while Pseudomonadales and Enterobacteriales were accumulated in the pseudostem. Shannon indices revealed much higher diversity in the rhizosphere than in the pseudostem endosphere. However, the expression of the transgenes did not result in changes in the diversity of Gammaproteobacteria, the closest relatives of the target pathogen. In this field experiment, the expression of the resistance genes appears to have no consequences for non-target rhizobacteria and endophytes.",Nimusiima J; Köberl M; Tumuhairwe JB; Kubiriba J; Staver C; Berg G,Scientific reports,2015,10.1038/srep18078,0.903055587624632,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.819951977400414,0.180048022599586,0.99999432045834,5.6795416604194e-6,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
18831,"Role of metabolism, resistance, and/or antagonism as drivers of endomicrobiomes assemblage in Origanum heracleoticum L.","The understanding of selective forces driving the compartmentalization of microbiota in plants remains limited. In this study, we performed a phenotypic characterization of bacterial endophytes isolated from the medicinal plant Origanum heracleoticum, together with the determination of the antibiotic resistance profiles and the antagonistic interactions of communities within and across different plant organs. Results revealed organ-related differences in the metabolic capabilities of bacteria, with those associated with stems displaying the highest metabolic activity for carbon sources. Contrarily, the patterns of antibiotic resistance appeared closely aligned with the taxonomical classification of the endophytes. The presence of antagonistic interactions, likely spurred by resource limitations, favor bacteria exhibiting greater metabolic plasticity. In conclusion, this research advances our comprehension of the intricate dynamics between plants and their associated microbiota, indicating that its composition is mainly influenced by forces contributing to the selection of distinct functions and phenotypic traits.",Semenzato G; Vitali F; Frascella A; Lollini L; Mocali S; Papini A; Fani R; Emiliani G,Communications biology,2025,10.1038/s42003-025-07527-9,0.996241556465758,Relevant,Presence,Presence,Presence,Presence,0.820747651171765,0.179252348828235,0.999999801366446,1.98633553827321e-7,Presence,Presence,Presence,Uncertain,Presence,Presence
