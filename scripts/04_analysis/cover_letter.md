Dear Dr. [Editor],

Please consider our manuscript, "The Sparsely Sampled Ubiquity of Global Fungal Endophytes," for publication as an Article in Nature.

Our study provides the first large-scale, computational test of a foundational paradigm in ecology: that all plants host fungal endophytes. This assumption underpins decades of research in ecology, agriculture, and biotechnology.

Using a machine learning pipeline to analyze over 19,000 abstracts, we reveal a critical paradox: while the published literature confirms this paradigm (we found zero verifiable examples of an endophyte-free plant taxon), we show this "ubiquity" is a generalization from an extraordinarily biased sample, with only 0.8% of known plant species ever having been studied.

This finding is of immediate importance because we show this 77% Global North sampling bias acts as a critical bottleneck in biodiversity research. It limits our ability to discover novel biotechnologies and climate-resilient symbioses from the world's most threatened ecosystems. This work has direct implications for ecology, climate science, and food security.

We believe these findings will be of great interest to the broad readership of Nature. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

B. Bock (on behalf of all authors)
