10.3390/jof9090905,Maehara_2023.pdf,Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Agents in Artemisia Endophytic Fungi and Their Abundance in Artemisia vulgaris Tissue,To Search,"Coronavirus disease 2019 is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Therapeutic agents for the disease are being developed. Endophytes are diverse and produce various secondary metabolites and bioactive substances. We isolated 13 endophytes from the leaves and stems of Artemisia vulgaris. Antiviral testing using the culture extracts of these endophytic fungi revealed that five isolates effectively inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV-2. These extracts were used to study the inhibitory effect of SARS-CoV-2 on 3C-like protease, and two isolates proved useful. Both isolates were from the genus Colletotrichum; therefore, the percentage of Artemisia endophytic fungi in the plant tissue was observed to be an important factor in plant site selection. Thus, we conducted a macroanalysis using next-generation sequencing to analyze the percentage of endophytes in the stems (whole, skin, and inner), leaves, roots, and cultivating soil, as well as to determine the location of each genus. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report that Colletotrichum spp. are abundant in stems and that stem-based methods are the most efficient for isolating endophytes targeting Colletotrichum spp.",leaf; stem; root,molecular; culture_based; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

In our study, we isolated seven endophytic fungal strains from Calea pinnatifida, which were identified as Hypomontagnella barbarensis, Neopestalotiopsis clavispora, Nigrospora sacchari-officinarum, Annulohypoxylon moriforme, Colletotrichum siamense, and Colletotrichum karstii (with two isolates from the same species). Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of the extracts was assessed, revealing that the extract from Hypomontagnella barbarensis demonstrated activity against Staphylococcus aureus. Further investigation of secondary metabolites, employing UHPLC-HR-ESI-MS/MS in combination with molecular networking, facilitated annotation of the nine compounds. Of these, five were identified based on matches with the GNPS spectral library, and four were predicted based on the molecular network. Notably, from the extract of Hypomontagnella barbarensis, two pairs of diastereoisomeric acyl-tetronic acid derivatives were isolated and characterized using MS and NMR spectroscopy. This study highlights the potential of endophytic fungi as a valuable source of novel antimicrobial agents.",NA,culture_based; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

We report on the isolation of seed-borne fungal endophytes from Phragmites australis (common reed) that were ascribed to the genus Stagonospora. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays revealed that a Stagonospora sp. regularly colonized reed as shown for a period of three years. In spring, it was only detected in roots, whereas in autumn, it could frequently be found in all organs, including seeds. Microcosm experiments revealed that seeds harbored viable propagules of the fungus that colonized the developing germling, indicating vertical transmission. Endophytic growth was confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy, reisolation of the fungus after surface sterilization, and PCR. Aseptic microcosms were established for studying fungal contributions towards host vitality. Several Stagonospora isolates enhanced reed biomass. Seed-borne endophytic Stagonospora spp. thus can provide improved vigor to common reed, which could be most important when seed-derived germlings establish new reed stands.",seed; root,culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; surface_sterilization,NA,NA,NA,NA
10.2989/10220119.2013.792632,Salomón_2013.pdf,"Occurrence of dark septate endophytes in Nothofagus seedlings from Patagonia, Argentina",To Search,"Temperate forests of southern Argentina and Chile cover a wide latitudinal and altitudinal range on both sides of the Andes, with Nothofagus species being one of the main tree species. Most of the larger remnants are protected within the limits of national parks and forest reserves. However, some of these are invaded by exotic conifers such as Pseudotsuga menziesii. In order to better understand the mycorrhizal condition within the Nothofagus-P. menziesii interaction, transects were established at six study sites along the effective recruitment area. Three treatments were established: Nothofagus forest without P. menziesii invasion (Forest), Nothofagus-P. menziesii matrix (Interface) and P. menziesii plantation lacking Nothofagus specimens (Plantation). A 2 kg mixed soil sample was taken at each treatment site and kept in brand-new plastic bags. A soil bioassay with Nothofagus seedlings acting as baits was set to evaluate the mycorrhizal inoculum potential and soil-fungi composition at each sampling treatment. Forty percent of the evaluated seedlings were found to be colonised by dark septate endophytes (DSE) fungi. Ectomycorrhizal colonisation percentage was significantly higher in plants growing in Forest soils (mean = 57.77%) when compared with Interface (mean = 42.53%) and Plantation (mean = 44.65%). The high incidence of DSE in young roots of Nothofagus seedlings in this study supports the hypothesis that DSE might be pioneering colonisers of young tree seedlings in secondary successional environments. For future interventions in the forest, either with productive or protective intentions, it should be taken into account the incidence of these fungi, which may have an important positive role in Nothofagus forest post-invasion recovery.",mycorrhizal; root,inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

A total of 153 endophytic fungi, classified into 6 genera, were isolated from C. cajan. Among them, only one strain, endophyte G6 identified as Fusarium solani, was found to produce vitexin. After the optimization of fermentation conditions, the highest vitexin yield (18.72 mg/L) for the strain was observed in PDB liquid medium containing 20.54 g/L of glucose and 8.90 g/L of ammonium sulfate, at an initial medium pH of 5.1 and at 28 degrees C for 6 days of cultivation. Moreover, the fungal vitexin exhibited notable osteoblastic proliferation stimulating activity. A novel vitexin-producing endophytic fungus F. solani G6 was characterized from C. cajan for the first time.

A total of 38 endophytic fungal strains were isolated from aquatic plants native to the Daepyeong wetland, and 27 strains were isolated from the Jilnal wetland. The internal transcribed spacer regions of fungal isolates were sequenced and a phylogenetic analysis was performed. In addition, endophytic fungal diversity from each wetland and host plant species was deduced. A total of 25 fungal genera were purely isolated, and 16 fungal genera were isolated from each of the two wetlands. Commonly isolated genera from both wetlands were Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Clonostachys, Fusarium, Leptosphaeria, Penicillium, and Talaromyces.

We collected American ginseng of one-, two-, three- and four-year-old plants cultivated in a forest reserve and identified the endophytic fungal isolates using traditional methods. The colonization frequency and the dominant endophytic fungal species were investigated. Endophytic fungal diversity indices and similarity coefficient were also assessed and all age groups of American ginseng studied were colonized by endophytic fungal assemblages; 134 fungal isolates were assigned to 27 taxa. The infection frequencies varied with the host age and tissue. The dominant endophytic fungi were recorded for each tissue and age of host. The roots of two- and four-year-old American ginseng exhibited the highest and the lowest Shannon-Wiener index respectively. Four-year-old American ginseng had a low similarity coefficient when compared with each of the other three ages classes.

10.1016/j.apsoil.2021.103993,He_2021.pdf,Colonization by dark septate endophytes improves the growth and rhizosphere soil microbiome of licorice plants under different water treatments,To Search,"Dark septate endophytes (DSE) are facultative biotrophic ascomycetes that colonize plant roots. DSE may provide nutrients to their plant hosts and help them adapt to various abiotic and biotic stresses. However, their effects on the microbiome composition in plant rhizosphere need further clarification. Here, we conducted a pot experiment to establish whether the responses of licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis) to DSE (Acrocalymma vagum, Paraboeremia putaminum) inoculation under different water treatments are caused by changes in the rhizosphere microbiome. Rhizosphere microbiome compositions were measured by Illumina MiSeq sequencing of the 16S and ITS2 rRNA genes. The inoculation with DSE strains had a positive effect on plant growth of licorice depending on DSE species and water treatments. Subsequently, a total of 1278 fungal and 1583 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OUTs) were obtained at a 97% sequence similarity level. Ascomycota were the predominant fungi and Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi and Firmicutes were the predominant bacteria. DSE inoculation and water regime significantly influenced the microbiome composition. However, the effects of DSE on the fungal community were greater than those on the bacterial community. P. putaminum exerted a stronger impact on the licorice rhizosphere microbiome than A. vagum under drought stress. The observed changes in edaphic factors (water condition, soil organic matter, available nitrogen, available phosphorus, and available potassium) caused by DSE inoculation could be explained by the variations in microbiome composition. A network analysis indicated that DSE inoculation augmented the relative abundance of beneficial symbiotrophic fungi and growth-promoting bacteria but diminished the relative abundance of pathogens in the licorice rhizosphere. The present study showed that the licorice rhizosphere microbial community differed between the DSE-inoculated and uninoculated plants. DSE had a stronger influence on the fungal than on the bacterial rhizosphere community under drought stress. These give us the guidance to develop biofertilizers with DSE consortia to enhance the cultivation of medicinal plants by shaping soil microbial community structure and soil nutrient status in dryland agriculture.",root,molecular; culture_based; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA
10.1016/j.funeco.2014.10.004,Nascimento_2015.pdf,Biodiversity of endophytic fungi in different leaf ages of Calotropis procera and their antimicrobial activity,To Search,"Calotropis procera has many important medicinal properties with proven pharmacological potential. Some of these properties may be mediated by its fungal endophytes. This study analyzed, for the first time, the community of endophytic fungi of C. procera outside its region of origin. A total of 156 fungal isolates distributed across 19 taxa were obtained from 468 fragments of C. procera leaves at different stages of maturation. The rate of endophyte colonization increased with the leaf age/development. The dominant species of endophytic fungi of C. procera introduced in Northeast Brazil were different from those found in studies on the same species and other species of the same genus in native regions. The dominant endophyte was Phaeoramularia calotropidis (63.5 %), followed by Guignardia bidwellii (21.1 %). Six isolates of endophytic fungi showed antimicrobial activity against human pathogenic micro-organisms and one plant pathogenic fungus. The antibacterial activity was more intense than the antifungal activity. The endophytic Curuularia pallescens (URM 6048) stood out inhibited Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyo genes, the plant pathogenic fungus Colletotrichum dematium.

In grasses, infection with fungal endophytes can also have strong effects on insects, potentially modifying the effects of plant genetic diversity. We manipulated the genetic diversity and endophyte infection of a grass in a field experiment. We show that diversity of primary parasitoids (3rd trophic level) and, especially, secondary parasitoids (4th trophic level) increases with grass genetic diversity while there was no effect of endophyte infection. The increase in insect diversity appeared to be due to a complementarity effect rather than a sampling effect. The higher parasitoid diversity could not be explained by a cascading diversity effect because herbivore diversity was not affected and the same herbivore species were present in all treatments. The effects on the higher trophic levels must therefore be due to a direct response to plant traits or mediated by effects on traits at intermediate trophic levels.",NA,culture_based; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the interactions between Salvia miltiorrhiza and its endophytes are largely unknown. The current study aimed at identifying its endophytic fungi and examining their inhibitory effects on anti-pathogenic fungus. Materials and Methods: Distinct species of endophytic fungi were isolated from the roots of Salvia miltiorrhiza, cultured, sequenced, aiming to predict their taxonomical structures. Meanwhile, extracts from each endophytic fungus fermentations were isolated, compared and evaluated on the inhibitory efficacies on five pathological fungi, Cercospora nicotianae, Phoma arachnidicola, Staphylococcus, Phytophthora eggplant, and Rhizoctonia cerealis. Results: A total of 34 strains of endophytic fungi were obtained from Salvia miltiorrhiza. Among them, SX19 and C. Gloeosporioids exhibited the most effective inhibitions on five pathogenic fungi. Conclusion: The anti-fungal activities of the endophytic fungus from Salvia miltiorrhiza were confirmed for the first time, and this may benefit crop quality and production in the future.",root,molecular; culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, change in AMF community structure with soil depth and vertical distributions of the other root-associated microorganisms are unclear. Here, we examined colonization by AMF and dark septate fungi (DSF), as well as the community structure of AMF and endophytic fungi (EF) and endophytic bacteria (EB) in association with soil depth in a semiarid desert with shallow groundwater. Roots of Sabina vulgaris and soils were collected from surface to groundwater level at 20-cm intervals. Soil chemistry (water content, total N, and available P) and colonization of AMF and DSF were measured. Community structures of AMF, EF, and EB were examined by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. AMF colonization decreased with soil depth, although it was mostly higher than 50%. Number of AMF phylotypes decreased with soil depth, but more than five phylotypes were observed at depths up to 100 cm. Number of AMF phylotypes had a significant and positive relationship with soil moisture level within 0-15% of soil water content. DSF colonization was high but limited to soil surface. Number of phylotypes of EF and EB were diverse even in deep soil layers, and the community composition was associated with the colonization and community composition of AMF. This study indicates that AMF species richness in roots decreases but is maintained in deep soil layers in semiarid regions, and change in AMF colonization and community structure associates with community structure of the other root-associated microorganisms.",mycorrhizal; root,molecular; microscopy; inoculation; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA
10.1029/2025GB008513,Luo_2025.pdf,Global Distribution and Influencing Factors of Plant-Available Phosphorus in (Semi-)Natural Soils,To Search,"Phosphorus (P) is frequently a limiting nutrient for plant growth in natural ecosystems. Determining plant-available P concentration in soil is essential for pinpointing areas where P availability might restrict plant growth and terrestrial carbon sequestration. However, the worldwide distribution and factors influencing plant-available P in (semi-)natural soils are not well understood. Here, we have developed a comprehensive global database that compiles plant-available P measurements using five prevalent analytical methods: Olsen, Bray-1, Mehlich III, Colwell, and AB-DTPA. The data set encompasses 6,253 plant-available P measurements in (semi-)natural soils (under natural ecosystems and >10 years since anthropogenic activities) at 3,353 globally distributed sites. Leveraging this extensive database, we initially examined the global distribution and influencing factors of plant-available soil P. Subsequently, we utilized a random forest model to delineate a detailed global map of plant-available soil P patterns. Globally, plant-available P varied over four orders of magnitude, from 0.01 to 99.2 mg kg(-1). The variation was best explained by parent material types and total soil P concentration. Random forest predicted plant-available P increased significantly with latitude in both hemispheres, though with large longitudinal variations. Global stock of plant-available P was estimated to be 0.73 Pg and 1.59 Pg at 0-30 cm and 30-100 cm soil depths. Our analysis provides insight into the underlying drivers of plant-available P in (semi-)natural soils, presents a spatially explicit assessment of plant-available soil P, which can provide a basis for assessing, predicting, and understanding global patterns of terrestrial P limitation and the functioning of the Earth system.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Its production is seriously affected by the bean stem maggot (BSM), Ophiomyia spp., which attacks seedlings. We evaluated the ability of eleven fungal isolates to colonize bean plants and the effects of inoculation on BSM feeding and oviposition, pupation, and adult emergence. All fungal isolates were able to colonize different bean plant parts (root, stem, and leaves), except isolates of Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana isolate ICIPE 273. Colonization was generally higher on the roots than on the stem and leaves and varied significantly between the fungal isolates. BSM feeding and oviposition were significantly reduced in all the fungus-inoculated bean plants which in turn affected pupation and adult emergence as compared to the control. Metarhizium anisopliae ICIPE 20 outperformed the other isolates in interfering with BSM lifecycle. Although M. anisopliae ICIPE 78 recorded a high number of punctures similar to the control, a significant reduction in the number of pupae and adult emergence was observed, suggesting possible BSM growth inhibition. This study clearly demonstrates that fungal endophytes can be considered as promising tools for the management of BSM in East Africa.",stem; root; leaf,culture_based; microscopy; inoculation,NA,NA,NA,NA

Endophytic fungi might be a new tool to safeguard crops against the perilous effects of global warming In this context, we isolated a thermal stress mitigating endophytic fungus from the fern Dryopteris filix L. The phylogenetic study and 18S rRNA sequence similarity confirmed the potential strain as Aspergillus violaceofuscus. The culture filtrate of A. violaceofuscus exhibited higher concentration of secondary metabolites that enhanced the total chlorophyll content, plant height and biomass of sunflower and soybean seedlings under heat stress. Conversely, the A. violaceofuscus associated plants achieved low levels of reactive oxygen species, abscisic acid, catalase, ascorbic acid oxidase, proline and an overall improved the nutritional value. The current study suggests that A. violaceofuscus can be used as heat stress adaptive tool in crops to achieve sustainable agriculture.",NA,molecular; culture_based; inoculation; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

In a previous study, we found consistent associations between trees in the pine family and acetic acid bacteria (AAB) occurring at high relative abundance inside their needles. Our objective here was to determine if that pattern may be general to conifers, or alternatively, is more likely restricted to pines or conifers growing in nutrient limited and exposed environments. We used 16S rRNA pyrosequencing to characterize the foliar endophyte communities of two conifers in the Cupressaceae family: Two coast redwood (CR; Sequoia sempervirens) populations and one giant sequoia (GS; Sequoiadendron giganteum) population were sampled. Similar to the pines, the endophyte communities of the giant trees were dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, and Actinobacteria. However, although some major operational taxonomic units (OTUs) occurred at a high relative abundance of 10-40% in multiple samples, no specific group of bacteria dominated the endophyte community to the extent previously observed in high-elevation pines. Several of the dominating bacterial groups in the CR and GS foliage (e.g., Bacillus, Burkholderia, Actinomycetes) are known for disease- and pest suppression, raising the possibility that the endophytic microbiome protects the giant trees against biotic stress. Many of the most common and abundant OTUs in our dataset were most similar to 16S rRNA sequences from bacteria found in lichens or arctic plants. For example, an OTU belonging to the uncultured Rhizobiales LAR1 lineage, which is commonly associated with lichens, was observed at high relative abundance in many of the CR samples. The taxa shared between the giant trees, arctic plants, and lichens may be part of a broadly defined endophyte microbiome common to temperate, boreal, and tundra ecosystems.",foliage,molecular; culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

It confers enhanced growth, improves resistance against biotic and tolerance to abiotic stress, and enhances grain yield in barley. To analyze mechanisms underlying P. indica-induced improved grain yield in a crop plant, the influence of different soil nutrient levels and enhanced biotic stress were tested under outdoor conditions. Higher grain yield was induced by the fungus independent of different phosphate and nitrogen fertilization levels. In plants challenged with the root rot-causing fungus Fusarium graminearum, P. indica was able to induce a similar magnitude of yield increase as in unchallenged plants. In contrast to the arbuscular mycorrhiza fungus Glomus mosseae, total phosphate contents of host plant roots and shoots were not significantly affected by P. indica. On the other hand, barley plants colonised with the endophyte developed faster, and were characterized by a higher photosynthetic activity at low light intensities. Together with the increased root formation early in development these factors contribute to faster development of ears as well as the production of more tillers per plant. The results indicate that the positive effect of P. indica on grain yield is due to accelerated growth of barley plants early in development, while improved phosphate supply-a central mechanism of host plant fortification by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-was not observed in the P. indica-barley symbiosis.",root; mycorrhiza; shoot; mycorrhizal; cotyledon,plant_microbe_interaction,NA,NA,NA,NA

The presence of the Epichloe endophytes is generally beneficial to the hosts due to enhanced tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses conferred by the endophytes. Many Epichloe spp. are asexual, and those infections always remain asymptomatic. However, some Epichloe spp. have a sexual stage and produce a macroscopic fruiting body, a stroma, that envelops the developing inflorescence causing a syndrome termed ""choke disease"". Here, we report a fungal and plant gene expression analysis of choke stroma tissue and asymptomatic inflorescence tissue of Epichloefestucae-infected strong creeping red fescue (Festuca rubra subsp. rubra). Hundreds of fungal genes and over 10% of the plant genes were differentially expressed when comparing the two tissue types. The differentially expressed fungal genes in the choke stroma tissue indicated a change in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, as well as a change in expression of numerous genes for candidate effector proteins. Plant stress-related genes were up-regulated in the stroma tissue, suggesting the plant host was responding to the epiphytic stage of E. festucae as a pathogen.",intercellular space; inflorescence,microscopy; plant_microbe_interaction,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study aimed to determine whether typical glyphosate residues observed in fields affect growth, plant metabolite composition and fungal root endophyte colonisation of wheat (Triticum aestivum).MethodsGlyphosate was applied to a sandy soil at 0, 0.33, 1, 3, 9 and 27 times a recommended label rate (LR) to establish soil glyphosate concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.4, 1, 4.7 and 14.8mgkg(-1) in topsoil (0-100mm) after a 28 d plant-free incubation. Wheat plants were then grown to establish thresholds of soilborne glyphosate on seedling emergence, major alterations to plant metabolic responses and fungal root endophyte colonisation.ResultsSeedling emergence was unaffected by soil residual glyphosate treatments. Shoot biomass was significantly higher at 1mgkg(-1) compared to the control treatments (P<0.05) and root biomass followed a similar trend. Leaf metabolite profiles of plants growing in soil containing 4.7-14.8mgkg(-1) glyphosate could be discriminated from the 0-0.4mgkg(-1) treatments due to significant (P<0.05) effects on the relative concentrations of metabolites. Fungal root endophyte colonisation was significantly reduced to 10% at 14.8mgkg(-1) (P<0.05) whereas shoot and root biomass remained unaffected.ConclusionsOur study highlights differences in glyphosate sensitivity thresholds between plants and fungal symbionts. Sub-lethal concentrations of residual soilborne glyphosate can alter wheat metabolism and impair fungal root endophyte colonisation. Effect thresholds for glyphosate may be lower for fungal symbionts than for host plants. However, the soil glyphosate residue levels required to reach such thresholds are high and would only be approached in commercial fields with a history of repeated glyphosate application.",root; shoot; leaf,culture_based; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Based on morphological and molecular identification, the endophytic fungi isolated were classified into seven genera (Hypocrea, Penicillium, Tolypocladium, Chaetomium, Xylaria, Nemania, and Creosphaeria), all belonging to one family (Xylariaceae). By screening with the 2,2'-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) decolorization assay, the ethyl acetate extracts of five endophytic fungi (T7, T21, T24, T32, and T38 strains), which exhibited remarkable Trolox equivalent (TE) antioxidant capacity (ranging from 997.06 to 1248.10 mu mol TE/g extract), were selected and their antioxidant capacity was further evaluated by assays for 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, hydroxyl radical scavenging, reducing power, and ferrous ion chelating. The ethyl acetate extracts of two endophytic fungi (T24 and T38) were found to have comparable scavenging abilities on both DPPH-free radicals (93.9 and 88.7%, respectively, at 50 mu g/mL) and hydroxyl radicals (97.1 and 89.4%, respectively, at 2 mg/mL) when compared with those of the positive controls (ascorbic acid and butylated hydroxytoluene, respectively). Although their reducing powers were similar to that of butylated hydroxytoluene, as indicated by absorbance (0.35 and 0.30 at 50 mu g/mL, respectively), only the T38 strain's ethyl acetate extract showed ferrous ion chelating ability (92.9% at 1 mg/mL) comparable to that of the EDTA-2Na control.

Within the tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus) - fungal endophyte (Neotyphodium coenophialum) symbiosis, fungal produced alkaloids are often invoked as the putative mechanism driving these ecological responses. Yet few measurements of alkaloids exist in the ecological literature. In this study, we quantified alkaloid levels in live, standing dead and decomposing endophyte-infected (E+) and -free (E-) plant material and simultaneously evaluated the direct and indirect effects of endophyte presence on tall fescue decomposition. Loline and ergot alkaloid levels were consistently high in live E+ (common toxic strain of N. coenophialum) tall fescue biomass throughout the sampling period (May-November 2007), whereas, E- live and standing dead material had non-detectable alkaloid concentrations. Standing dead E+ biomass had significantly reduced alkaloid levels (6-19x lower than the levels measured in the corresponding live E+ biomass) that were equivalent to E- live and dead for loline but were still somewhat higher than E- material for ergots. In an effort to test the role of alkaloids in directly inhibiting decomposition, as has been suggested by previous studies, we conducted a litter bag experiment using green, alkaloid-laden E+ and alkaloid-free E- tall fescue plant material. We incubated E+ and E- litter bags in both E+ and E- tall fescue stands for 170 days, and measured mass loss, carbon and nitrogen content, and ergot and loline alkaloid concentrations over the incubation period. Consistent with previous reports, both direct and indirect effects of endophyte presence on litter decomposition were observed: endophyte presence in the litter and surrounding microenvironment significantly reduced decomposition rates. Surprisingly, despite large differences in alkaloid content between E+ and E- litter from Day 0-Day 21 of the incubation, direct effects of the endophyte on litter decomposition, while significant, were relatively small (differences in mass loss between E+ and E- litter were never > 3%). Alkaloids were gone from E+ material by day 56. We propose that results from this study indicating alkaloids are largely absent in standing dead material (the typical input to the decomposition process), and that despite being present in our litter bag experiment, failed to produce large differences in mass loss between E+ and E- material questions the supposition that fungal produced alkaloids directly inhibit decomposition. Additional studies exploring the mechanisms behind the direct and indirect effects of endophytes on this ecosystem process are needed.",NA,culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the present study, 64 endophytic fungi were isolated from Malaysian marine plants and seaweeds. The endophyte extracts were tested for cytotoxic (seven cancer cell lines) and antimicrobial (against four bacteria and two fungi) activities. Out of 64 extracts tested, 49 (77%) were able to inhibit cancer cell lines. Eight of the endophyte extracts that were potent (IC50 <= 0.1 mu g ml(-1)) against colon and lung cancer cell lines were further compared for their effects on a normal human fibroblast cell line. The marine endophytic fungal extracts showed stronger antimicrobial activity against bacteria (72%) than fungi (16%). The bioactivity of a few selected marine endophytic fungal extracts was comparable to a number of current commercial anticancer, antibacterial and antifungal agents.

Although a large amount of evidence suggests a mutualistic role for vertically transmitted endophytic fungi in agronomic grasses, the role of horizontally transmitted endophytic fungi as mutualists has been challenged. Recent studies, however, have shown that horizontally transmitted endophytic fungi can act as mutualists to their plant hosts by providing defense against pathogens and defoliators. In particular, several experimental studies have shown that endophytic fungi interact negatively with leaf-cutting ants and their fungal cultivar, but these studies were performed under laboratory conditions. Using field colonies of Atta colombica in Central Panama, we measured the fungal endophyte content in the forage material of leaf-cutting ants and compared it to ambient endophyte levels. We then used the collected data to model the area of plant material containing endophytes that enters a mature colony daily. We found that mature colonies collect leaf material that is 20% lower in endophyte abundance than surrounding leaves. A similar pattern was observed for newly emerged colonies. Our model suggests that via ant foraging preferences, leaf-cutting ants reduce the possible area of material containing endophytes entering the colony by 33%. Our results provide further evidence for a negative interaction between leaf-cutting ants and horizontally transmitted endophytes, suggesting that fungal endophytes have a defensive role in tropical plants by influencing leaf-cutting ant foraging preferences.",leaf,culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

The experimental design was completely randomized with six treatments ( control, native microbial inoculant, and four arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi isolates: UFLA05 - Gigaspora albida, UFLA351 - Rhizoglomus clarum, UFLA372 - Claroideoglomus etunicatum, and UFLA401 - Acaulospora morrowiae), with four replicates. The parameters evaluated were: height plant, the number of branches, shoot and root dry mass matter, root length and volume, leaf phosphorus, mycorrhizal colonization, the number of spores of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, the number of nodules of nitrogen fixing bacteria, and the presence of endophytic dark septate fungi, after 95 days of inoculation. The high mycorrhizal colonization of gliricidia does not guarantee an increase in biomass, which depends on the interaction of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, the endophytic dark septate fungi, the nitrogen fixing bacteria, and the endophytic bacteria. Gliricidia was responsive to the inoculation of the native microbiota, UFLA372 and UFLA401. Mycorrhizal colonization by UFLA401 was influenced by the presence of nitrogen fixing bacteria. Gliricidia was not responsive to the inoculation of UFLA05 and UFLA351.

This measure has become a suitable and safe alternative for chemical fungicides in plant disease management. Endophytic fungi have received much attention as biological control agents against many plant pathogens through antibiosis, parasitism, invading spores, mycelium, and cells of the pathogen, and secreting bioactive metabolites. While the therapeutic properties of Garcinia atroviridis have been studied, the existence of microbial endophytes and their properties is still less documented. In this research, G. atroviridis endophytic fungi were isolated and identified by fungal colony morphology observation combined with the PCR-amplified fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analyses. Fungal endophytes were assessed for their biocontrol potential against Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. In total, 111 endophytic fungal isolates harboring inside the leaf, branch, and fruit of G. atroviridis belonged to 5 different species with 3 different genera and two unidentified genera. All the endophytic fungal species isolated were evaluated using an in vitro dual culture assay against C. gloeosporioides, a common pathogen that causes anthracnose disease. The results of the present study clearly showed that seven species of isolated fungal endophytes were capable of inhibiting the mycelial colony growth of C. gloeosporioides with an inhibition percentage between 54.67% to 87.94%. Among these species, Nigrospora sphaerica recorded the highest PIRG with 87.94%.

A total of 9 498 Galerina and 5 731 Mycena reads were mapped to branches broadly distributed throughout backbone trees, reflecting no obvious evolutionary specialization of particular fungal lineages to moss hosts/substrata. Although a few OTUs occurred with equal frequency across the hosts, most exhibited some degree of specialization to one or more bryophytes, indicating that the quality of different mosses as substratum varies between species. With one exception, all Galerina and Mycena OTUs were more frequent and abundant in senescent than photosynthetic tissues, likely reflecting saprotrophic nutritional modes in the fungi. A single Mycena OTU showed considerable colonization of both tissues, which may reflect an opportunistic parasitic or endophytic lifestyle. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

Here, we investigated the diversity of endophytic fungi from Huperzia serrata and the potential for discovering novel fungal natural products. One hundred and fifty-five endophytic fungi isolates obtained from H. serrata, belonging to four classes Dothideomycetes (47.3 %), Sordariomycetes (36.8 %), Eurotiomycetes (10.6 %) and an undefined class (5.3 %, Mucoraceae), were grouped into nine genera based on morphological and molecular identification. Colletotrichum, Cladosporium, Sordariomycetes and Guignardia were the dominant genera, whereas the remaining genera were infrequent groups. To our knowledge, the fungal genera Mucor and Neurospora were first reported in Huperzia plant. Among these endophytic fungi isolates, strain B14, belonging to Penicillium oxalicum, gave a gray precipitate with Dragendorff's reagent. A new pentapeptide was isolated from the culture of strain B14, and its chemical structure was elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic data from H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR and ESI-MS/MS.

RKNs induce root galls by altering growth pattern in the cell elongation zone, thereby obstructing nutrient transport to various parts of the plant. This project was designed to control RKN infestation in Solanum melongena by utilizing plant-friendly endophytic fungi. Garlic plants were used to isolate endophytic fungi which were then screened for their potential to inhibit RKN in S. melongena. Based on its namatocidal potential, the endophyte strain, named GR was selected and identified to be Aspergillus fumigatus with the help of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) segment of the rRNA genes. The fungus had the ability to release indole acetic acid (IAA), salicylic acid (SA), phenols and flavonoids. The potential endophytes were assessed for the biocontrol of RKN in S. melongena seedlings grown in pots. The isolated strain conferred resistance to RKN penetration, leading to a substantial reduction in the frequency of root galls by 6.8-fold than the control. In comparison to control, endophyte-associated seedlings exhibited a 50 % increase in SA levels, indicating a SA-dependent defense against RKN. The activity of catalase and ascorbic acid was also boosted to suppress ROS generated in the RKN infested seedlings. The culture of the endophytic isolate contained nematicidal phenol (p-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, Calycosin) and an alkaloid (Cyclopenin). These findings suggest that the isolated endophyte confers resistance to RKN in Solanum melongena by modulating host physiology and releasing nematicidal substances.",root; gall,molecular; culture_based; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

The assumption is these pathways have adaptive value to the organism but often the evidence to support this role is lacking. We provide the first genetic evidence that the fungal produced secondary metabolite, peramine, protects a host plant from insect herbivory. Peramine is a potent insect feeding deterrent synthesized by Epichloe/Neotyphodium mutualistic endophytes in association with their grass hosts. The structure of peramine, a pyrrolopyrazine, suggests that it is the product of a reaction catalysed by a two-module non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS). Candidate sequences for a peramine synthetase were amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Four unique NRPS products were identified, two of which were preferentially expressed in planta. One of these hybridized to known peramine producing strains. This clone was used to isolate an Epichloe festucae cosmid that contained a two-module NRPS, designated perA. Nine additional genes, which show striking conservation of microsynteny with Fusarium graminearum and other fungal genomes, were identified on the perA-containing cosmid. Associations between perennial ryegrass and an E. festucae mutant deleted for perA lack detectable levels of peramine. A wild-type copy of perA complemented the deletion mutant, confirming that perA is a NRPS required for peramine biosynthesis. In a choice bioassay, plant material containing the perA mutant was as susceptible to Argentine stem weevil (ASW) (Listronotus bonariensis) feeding damage as endophyte-free plants confirming that peramine is the E. festucae metabolite responsible for ASW feeding deterrent activity.",stem,molecular; culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Plant-microbe symbiotic associations have evolved regulatory mechanisms to adapt to environmental stress conditions. However, the interactive effects of different fungi on host growth and stress tolerance under drought conditions remain unclear. Objective: This study explored the effects of varying polyethylene glycol (PEG-6000) concentrations (0%, 15%, 25%, and 35%) on the growth and physiological responses of two ectomycorrhizal fungi (Suillus granulatus (Sg) and Pisolithus tinctorius (Pt)) and two dark septate endophytes (Pleotrichocladium opacum (Po) and Pseudopyrenochaeta sp. (Ps)) isolated from the root system of Pinus tabuliformis. Specifically, the study aimed to evaluate six inoculation treatments, including no inoculation (CK), single inoculations with Sg, Pt, Po, Ps, and a mixed inoculation (Sg: Pt : Po: Ps = 1:1:1:1), on the growth and physiological characteristics of P. tabuliformis seedlings under different water regimes: well-watered at 70% +/- 5%, light drought at 50% +/- 5%, and severe drought at 30% +/- 5% of the maximum field water holding capacity. Results: All four fungi exhibited the capacity to cope with drought stress by enhancing antioxidant activities and regulating osmotic balance. Upon successful root colonization, they increased plant height, shoot biomass, root biomass, total biomass, and mycorrhizal growth response in P. tabuliformis seedlings. Under drought stress conditions, fungal inoculation improved seedling drought resistance by increasing superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, free proline and soluble protein contents, and promoting nitrogen and phosphorus uptake. Notably, mixed inoculation treatments significantly enhanced antioxidant capacity, osmotic adjustment, and nutrient acquisition abilities, leading to superior growth promotion effects under drought stress compared to single inoculation treatments. Conclusion: All four fungi tolerated PEG-induced drought stress, with increased antioxidant enzyme activities and osmotic adjustment substances and they promoted the growth and enhanced drought resistance of P. tabuliformis seedlings.",root; shoot; mycorrhizal,culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

This project investigated seed germination, physiological characteristics and antioxidant enzyme activities of Achnatherum inebrians in order to better understand the adaptation to saline soil environments exhibited by this species and provide information to aid future breeding selection and cultivation. A set of 20 different alkali-saline stress conditions were stimulated by mixing two neutral (NaCl and Na2SO4) and two alkaline (NaHCO3 and Na2CO3) salts with soil in different proportions (A: NaCl: Na2SO4=1: 1; B: NaCl: Na2SO4: NaHCO3=1: 2: 1; C: NaCl: Na2SO4: NaHCO3: Na2CO3=1: 9: 9: 1; D: NaCl: Na2SO4: NaHCO3: Na2CO3=1: 1: 1: 1; E: NaCl: Na2SO4: NaHCO3: Na2CO3 = 9: 1: 1: 9) and at concentrations of 50, 100, 150, and 200 mmol•L-1. These soil mixtures were used to grow seedlings of endophyte-infected (E+) and endophyte-free (E-) drunken horse grass, and analyze the general salt tolerance of drunken horse grass accessions at the germination and seedling growth stages were analyzed. The seed germination rate, germination vigor, germination index, energy index and shoot length, root length, root-shoot ratio, and shoot tissue antioxidant enzymes peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA) and proline were evaluated and analyzed data explored by subordinate function analysis. It was found that the germination rate, germination potential, germination index and vigor index of both E+ and E- drunken horse grass were decreased under the five different saline-alkali stresses. Germination was significantly inhibited with increase in saline-alkali stress concentration (P< 0.05). The radicle length and root-shoot ratio were also significantly decreased with increased salt concentration. Except for treatments C and E, physiological indexes (POD, SOD and CAT activities, MDA and proline levels in shoot tissue) of drunken horse grass were reduced at higher salt concentrations. Subordinate function analysis and the multivariate analysis of salt tolerance indicated that the order of salt tolerance across treatments was A> D> B> C> E. In conclusion, saline-alkali stress significantly inhibited seed germination and seedling growth of drunken horse grass (P< 0.05). Among the alkaline salts tested (NaHCO3 and Na2CO3), Na2CO3, especially, had a stronger inhibitory effect on seed germination and growth. Vigor index, root length, POD, SOD, and proline were found to be the most useful indicators to evaluate the salt tolerance of drunken horse grass. The salt tolerance of E+ drunken horse grass was found to be better than that of E-. Epichloë endophytic fungi can improve the osmotic adjustment and scavenging of reactive oxygen species of drunken horse grass, thus reducing the membrane lipid peroxidation, and improving the salt tolerance of A. inebrians. © 2021, Editorial Office of Acta Prataculturae Sinica.

Some of the structures likely were produced by some fungal group, and may represent (resting) spores, microsclerotia, and conidiophores. The affinities of the others, and sometimes even their biological nature, remain difficult to determine. Nevertheless, documenting these structures is important because it provides the first indication for vascular plant leaves that were colonized by different types of organisms in a late Paleozoic ecosystem.

The morphology, the interaction with nematodes and plants and the phylogenetic relationships of these strains originating from a broad geographic range covering Western Europe to Asia Minor were studied. Phylogenetic analyses using five genomic loci including ITSrDNA, LSUrDNA, SSUrDNA, rpb2 and tef1-alpha were carried out. The strains were found to represent a distinct phylogenetic lineage most closely related to Equiseticola and Ophiosphaerella, and Polydomus karssenii (Phaeosphaeriaceae, Pleosporales) is introduced here as a new species representing a monotypic genus. The pathogenicity tests against nematode eggs fulfilled Koch's postulates using in vitro nematode bioassays and showed that the fungus could parasitise its original nematode host H. filipjevi as well as the sugar beet cyst nematode H. schachtii, and colonise cysts and eggs of its hosts by forming highly melanised moniliform hyphae. Light microscopic observations on fungus-root interactions in an axenic system revealed the capacity of the same fungal strain to colonise the roots of wheat and produce melanised hyphae and microsclerotia-like structure typical for dark septate endophytes. Confocal laser scanning microscopy further demonstrated that the fungus colonised the root cells by predominant intercellular growth of hyphae, and frequent formation of appressorium-like as well as penetration peg-like structures through internal cell walls surrounded by callosic papilla-like structures. Different strains of the new fungus produced a nearly identical set of secondary metabolites with various biological activities including nematicidal effects irrespective of their origin from plants or nematodes.",root; cell wall; papilla,molecular; culture_based; microscopy; plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

For the first time, we investigated the culturable endophytic actinobacteria associated with ten epiphytic orchid species of Assam, India. 51 morphologically distinct actinobacteria were recovered from surface sterilized roots and leaves of orchids and characterized based on different PGP and antifungal traits. According to the 16S rRNA gene sequence, these isolates were divided into six families and eight genera, where Streptomyces was most abundant (n=29, 56.86%), followed by Actinomadura, Nocardia, Nocardiopsis, Nocardioides, Pseudonocardia, Microbacterium, and Mycolicibacterium. Regarding PGP characteristics, 25 (49.01%) isolates demonstrated phosphate solubilization in the range of 61.1 +/- 4.4 - 289.7 +/- 11.9 mu g/ml, whereas 27 (52.94%) isolates biosynthesized IAA in the range of 4.0 +/- 0.08 - 43.8 +/- 0.2 mu g/ml, and 35 (68.62%) isolates generated ammonia in the range of 0.9 +/- 0.1 - 5.9 +/- 0.2 mu mol/ml. These isolates also produced extracellular enzymes, viz. protease (43.13%), cellulase (23.52%), pectinase (21.56%), ACC deaminase (27.45%), and chitinase (37.25%). Out of 51 isolates, 27 (52.94%) showed antagonism against at least one test phytopathogen. In molecular screening, most isolates with antifungal and chitinase producing traits revealed the presence of 18 family chitinase genes. Two actinobacterial endophytes, Streptomyces sp. VCLA3 and Streptomyces sp. RVRA7 were ranked as the best strains based on PGP and antifungal activity on bonitur scale. GC-MS examination of ethyl acetate extract of these potent strains displayed antimicrobial compound phenol, 2,4-bis-(1,1-dimethylethyl) as the major metabolite along with other antifungal and plant growth beneficial bioactive chemicals. SEM analysis of fungal pathogen F. oxysporum (MTCC 4633) affected by Streptomyces sp. VCLA3 revealed significant destruction in the spore structure. An in vivo plant growth promotion experiment with VCLA3 and RVRA7 on chili plants exhibited statistically significant (p<0.05) improvements in all of the evaluated vegetative parameters compared to the control. Our research thus gives insight into the diversity, composition, and functional significance of endophytic actinobacteria associated with orchids. This research demonstrates that isolates with multiple plant development and broad-spectrum antifungal properties are beneficial for plant growth.

Evidence from a transcriptional analysis of gibberellin and carbohydrate metabolic genes after defoliation,To Search,"Global meat and milk production depends to a large extent on grazed pastures, with Loliurn perenne being the major forage grass in temperate regions. Defoliation and subsequent regrowth of leaf blades is a major and essential event with respect to L. perenne growth and productivity. Following defoliation, carbohydrates (mainly fructans and sucrose) have to be mobilized from heterotrophic tissues to provide energy and carbon for regrowth of photosynthetic tissues. This mobilization of reserve carbohydrates requires a substantial change in the expression of genes coding for enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. Here we tested the hypothesis that gibberellins (GA) are at the core of the processes regulating the expression of these genes. Thus, we examined the transcript profiles of genes involved in carbohydrate and GA metabolic pathways across a time course regrowth experiment. Our results show that following defoliation, the immediate reduction of carbohydrate concentrations in growing tissues is associated with a concomitant increase in the expression of genes encoding carbohydrate mobilizing invertases, and was also associated with a strong decrease in the expression of fructan synthesizing fructosyltransferase genes. We also show that the decrease in fructan levels is preceded by increased expression of the GA activating gene GA(3)-oxidase and decreased expression of the GA inactivating gene GA(2)-oxidase in sheaths. GA(3)-oxidase expression was negatively, while GA(2)-oxidase positively linked to sucrose concentrations. This study provides indicative evidence that gibberellins might play a role in L. perenne regrowth following defoliation and we hypothesize that there is a link between gibberellin regulation and sugar metabolism in L. perenne.",leaf; blade; sheath; leaf blade; leaf blades,culture_based; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although DSE active metabolites have been investigated there have been few studies on the role of DSE extracellular metabolites as plant biostimulants. The purpose of the current study was to (i) determine the changes in growth, nutrient uptake, and root development of maize exposed to DSE extracellular metabolites at different incubation times, and (ii) determine the effects of DSE extracellular metabolites on maize root exudation at different incubation times. Maize seedlings were exposed to DSE extracellular metabolites for different incubation times. Maize seedling growth, nutrition and root structure indicators were determined, and maize root exudates were extracted for non-targeted metabolomic analysis. The addition of DSE extracellular metabolites cultured for 12 days had the best effect on biomass and chlorophyll content increase, root devel-opment and nutrient uptake in maize. Metabolomic analysis of maize root exudates identified a total of 94 metabolites belonging to different chemical groups. Among them, the contents of lipids and lipid-like molecules in maize root exudates accounted for the largest proportion. The proportion of lipids and lipid-like molecules in maize root exudates treated with DSE extracellular metabolites increased. Compared with other treatments, the contents of organic acids and derivatives in maize root exudates with DSE extracellular metabolites cultured for 12 days accounted for the largest proportion. Pathway analysis shows that root exudates had a greater influence on glycerophospholipid metabolism and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. These findings clearly indicate that DSE extracellular metabolites have the potential to be developed as plant growth stimulators and that the addition of DSE extracellular metabolites may affect many metabolic processes in maize roots.",seed; root,culture_based; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Though their origin and evolution is enigmatic, they are known to play an important role in plant growth and development. Here we explore the endophytic fungal diversity of a perennial creeping vine, Ipomea pes-caprae (family Convolulaceae), occurring naturally in the coastal sand dunes of peninsular India. Of the ten endophytes isolated from the plant, Fusarium oxysporum (MH511104) was found to grow even at 2 M NaCl in potato dextrose agar medium. The fungus was able to successfully colonize and impart salinity tolerance to salt-sensitive paddy variety, IR-64.

Surface sterilization is an indispensable process before high-throughput sequencing (HTS) and tissue separation of plant endophytes, but its potential impact on the composition and diversity of endophytes has rarely been investigated. In the present work, the influence of sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) on the diversity of endophytic bacteria and fungi in leaves and stems of tea plants was investigated. We found that the diversity of bacterial endophytes was significantly affected by the concentration of NaClO as well as the pretreatment time. Pretreatment with 0.5% NaClO for 8 min and 2.0% NaClO for 3 min were suitable for the tea plant leaves and stems, respectively, but the effects of NaClO on the diversity of fungal endophytes were limited according to the results from HTS. Regardless of NaClO sterilization, most of the endophytes in tissues, such as the dominant taxa, could not be Isolated by using the regular culture-dependent approaches. Collectively, our results demonstrated that the pretreatment with NaClO should be modified to precisely understand the diversity of endophytes from different tissues of tea plants and also indicate that more attention should be paid to establish specific culture-dependent protocols for the isolation of plant endophytes.",leaf; stem,molecular; culture_based; ecological_studies; surface_sterilization,NA,NA,NA,NA

Populations from regions with different environmental conditions are considered as ecotypes and are associated with different seedborne Epichloe fungal endophytes. Association with Epichloe provides B. auleticus with increased growth capacity and resistance against pathogens. The seeds mature at the end of spring and germinate in autumn, remaining dormant during wet and warm summer. As the persistence of Epichloe endophytes in the seed is highly sensitive to temperature and humidity, we studied how the endophytes modulate seed germination in response to these factors in two B. auleticus ecotypes named La Pampa (LP) and El Palmar (EP). We also studied how environmental factors during germination affect endophyte survival. In the LP ecotype, adapted to coldest temperatures in autumn, Epichloe improved final germination under alternating temperatures, but had no effects on germination inhibition imposed by low water availability. In the EP ecotype, adapted to warm humid summer and autumn, the endophyte promoted germination at constant 25 degrees C and alternating 15/25 degrees C temperatures, and prevented germination at low water potentials. At 30 degrees C, seed germination was inhibited and whereas seeds remained viable, endophyte survival was significantly lowered. The effect of Epichloe on B. auleticus seed germination was ecotype-specific: promoting germination at alternating temperatures in La Pampa ecotype or at high temperatures in El Palmar ecotype, while inhibiting it at low water availabilities, could be an endophyte-mediated ecotypic strategy minimising endophyte mortality and increasing seedling establishment.",seed,culture_based; bioactivity_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this work, the role of host genetics in plant-microbiome assembly was studied in a full-sibling family of apple (Malus x domestica) trees infected with the fungal pathogen Neonectria ditissima. A Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis showed that there are multiple loci which influence the abundance of individual endophytic taxa, with the majority of QTL having a moderate to large effect (20-40%) on endophyte abundance. QTL regions on LG 1, 3, 4, 5, 10, 12, 13, 14 and 15 were shown to affect multiple taxa. Only a small proportion of the variation in overall taxonomic composition was affected by host genotype, with significant QTL hits for principal components explaining <8% and <7.4% of the total variance in bacterial and fungal composition, respectively. Four of the identified QTL colocalised with previously identified regions associated with tolerance to Neonectria ditissima.

Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) have become a crucial area of research aimed at addressing these challenges. However, a knowledge gap exists regarding how PGPR impacts the microenvironments surrounding plant roots. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the effects of two distinct PGPR strains, Streptomyces griseorubiginosus BTU6 (known for its resistance to smut disease) and S. chartreusis WZS021, on sugarcane roots. Additionally, we compare the resultant modifications in the physicochemical characteristics of the rhizospheric soil and root architecture. The results reveal that following the inoculation of S. chartreusis WZS021, there was a significant increase in the active chemicals associated with nitrogen metabolism in sugarcane roots. This enhancement led to a substantial enrichment of nitrogen-cycling microbes like Pseudomonas and Gemmatimona. This finding supports earlier research indicating that S. chartreusis WZS021 enhances sugarcane's capacity to utilize nitrogen effectively. Furthermore, after treatment with S. chartreusis, Aspergillus became the predominant strain among endophytic fungi, resulting in alterations to their community structure that conferred drought resistance. In contrast, the relative abundance of Xanthomonas in the root environment decreased following inoculation with S. griseorubiginosus. Instead, Gemmatimona became more prevalent, creating a favorable environment for plants to bolster their resistance against disease. Notably, inoculations with S. chartreusis WZS021 and S. griseorubiginosus BTU6 led to substantial changes in the chemical composition, enzymatic activity, and microbial community composition in the soil surrounding sugarcane roots. However, there were distinct differences in the specific alterations induced by each strain.

Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is the causal agent of anthracnose in acai palms (Euterpe precatoria Mart.), affecting severely the leaflets of this plant. Here, we report the first investigation on the fungal endophytic community associated with the leaflets of E. precatoria in native and cultivated habitats in the Western Amazonia, using culture-dependent method. We also identified potential C. gloeosporioides-antagonist foliar endophytic fungi using dual culture and acai leaflets detached assays. Our data revealed that the composition of the fungal community in E. precatoria was influenced by cultivation system of these plants, and the native plants sampled exhibited higher levels of fungal diversity compared to the cultivated plants. The morphotype Colletotrichum sp. 11, probably a latent pathogen (C. gloeosporioides), was the most abundant endophyte species and was obtained from all samples of planted acai palms. A total of 151 endophytes were able to inhibit in vitro growth of C. gloeosporioides, indicating different kinds of antagonism such as competition, mycoparasitism and antibiosis. Among the endophytic fungi tested in the detached leaflet assay, Ramichloridium sp., recovered from native E. precatoria, showed a greater ability in the control of anthracnose. Altogether, this study suggests that the Ramichloridium sp. isolate can be a promising candidate for the biological control of C. gloeosporioides and that E. precatoria can host endophytic fungi that help in the defense against phytopathogenic fungi.",leaflet,culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

These soils contain a large number of endemic plants. Limited information is available about the microbial symbionts of these plants. We collected eight endemic gypsophilous flowering plant species in New Mexico and characterized their root-and leaf-associated fungi using molecular, microscopic, and culture techniques. Dominant culturable fungi were identified by analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA region. Microscopic analysis of roots indicated that gypsophilous plants are colonized primarily by arbuscular mycorrhizal and dark septate fungi. Sporobolus nealleyi Vasey (a gypsophilous grass) showed the greatest percentages of fungal colonization. All fungal isolates belonged to the Ascomycota, dominated by the orders Pleosporales and Sordariales. Isolates in the Alternaria complex were the dominant fungi recovered from leaves, and Monosporascus was the dominant genus recovered from roots. The dominant genera show low plant specificity and wide distribution as plant symbionts in arid regions. The generalist nature of gypsophilous plants with respect to their fungal symbionts could be advantageous for their successful establishment and survival. A common cohort of fungal symbionts could facilitate efficient transfer of nutrients and water in these plants that are restricted to a specific substrate in an environment dominated by extreme conditions.",root; leaf; mycorrhizal,molecular; culture_based; microscopy; inoculation,NA,NA,NA,NA

Currently, there are no effective, environmentally friendly control methods available. RNA interference technology has been extensively utilized to screen functional genes in eukaryotes and to explore sustainable pest management approaches through genetic engineering. In this study, we identified 353 predicted lethal genes in PWN by comparing its genome with those of lethal genes from Caenorhabditis elegans. We selected five predicted lethal genes (Bxy1177, Bxy1239, Bxy1104, Bxy667, and BxyAK1) with identification values exceeding 60% to evaluate their nematicidal effects on PWN. We tested the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) of these genes using two methods: first, soaking in a synthesized dsRNA solution in vitro, and second, feeding on a dsRNA-engineered endophytic fungus, Fusarium babinda. Following dsRNA ingestion, either through soaking or fungal feeding, the expression of genes Bxy1177, Bxy667, Bxy1104, and BxyAK1 was significantly suppressed. Notably, nematode populations that consumed fungi expressing dsL1177 and dsAK1 showed substantial declines over time.

A comprehensive understanding of the temporal changes in symbiotic fungal colonisation of sugarcane roots following ratooning is currently lacking, therefore limiting our ability to accurately assess the role of root-associated fungi on soil nutrition and crop productivity. This field study investigated the colonisation dynamics of native populations of AM/DSE in the root systems of 1st and 2nd racoon phase sugarcane at two proximal sites where crops had previously been grown for either 1 or 2 years. Total percent colonisation of AM/DSE in two sugarcane root types (sett roots/shoot roots) was quantified over 28 weeks of crop development. Relevant AM functional structures (arbuscules, hyphae, spores and vesicles) were also delineated and quantified at each observation for both root types. Significant differences (P < 0.05) in total root colonisation over time for both fungal types and between sett roots and shoot roots were observed. At each site, a variety of AM morphologies were observed in both root types. Maximum sett root colonisation for both fungal types was observed at 5 weeks in the 1st ratoon and at 7 weeks in the 2nd ratoon crop, which may be due to difference in the racoon year, but differences in field history between the sites cannot be ruled out as a contributing factor. Significantly lower levels of DSE sett root colonisation were observed in the 2nd ratoon compared to the 1st ratoon crop. Maximum AM shoot root colonisation occurred at 7 weeks in the 1st ratoon and 11 weeks in the 2nd ratoon crop. In shoot roots, significantly lower levels of DSE compared to AM colonisation were observed at both sites. For both fungal types, sett root colonisation was significantly higher than for shoot roots at both sites. There were no differences in total AM sett root colonisation between sites. For both fungal types, there were no differences in total shoot root colonisation between sites. Maximum levels of AM/DSE sett root colonisation occurred between 5-7 weeks, prior to shoot root establishment and rapid growth period of 1st and 2nd ratoon crops. While AM colonisation of sett roots was maintained across racoon phases, there is a need to account for apparent differences in DSE sett root colonisation between 1st and 2nd ratoon crops.

From the Mexican maize landrace ""Raza conico"" (red and blue varieties), we identified yeasts and evaluated in vitro their ability to promote plant growth. Auxin production was detected from yeast isolates and confirmed using Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Inoculation tests were performed on maize, and morphological parameters were measured. Eighty-seven yeast strains were obtained (50 from blue corn and 37 from red corn). These were associated with three families of Ascomycota (Dothideaceae, Debaryomycetaceae, and Metschnikowiaceae) and five families of Basidiomycota (Sporidiobolaceae, Filobasidiaceae, Piskurozymaceae, Tremellaceae, and Rhynchogastremataceae), and, in turn, distributed in 10 genera (Clavispora, Rhodotorula, Papiliotrema, Candida, Suhomyces, Soliccocozyma, Saitozyma Holtermaniella, Naganishia, and Aeurobasidium).

RY31, C. lusitaniae Y11, R. glutinis Y23, and Naganishia sp. Y52 produced auxins from L-Trp (11.9-52 mu g/mL) and root exudates (1.3-22.5 mu g/mL). Furthermore, they stimulated the root development of A. thaliana. Inoculation of auxin-producing yeasts caused a 1.5-fold increase in maize plant height, fresh weight, and root length compared to uninoculated controls.

This study aimed to determine the efficiency of B. bassiana colonization of tomato plants using different inoculation methods, and how colonization of the host plant affects the key pest of tomato, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci. To confirm fungal colonization efficiency, nested PCR technique was used to detect B. bassiana sequences in Solanum lycopersicum. Distribution of the fungus within the plant parts was determined by selective medium. Tomato growth parameters were determined with plants that had been inoculated using direct spraying or irrigation of the rhizosphere. B. tabaci performance assays were carried out in a cage, and preference to treatments was determined using Y-tube olfactometer studies. Results show that B. bassiana can effectively colonize tomato, with colonization rate using leaf spraying reaching 100% within 14 days. Fungal presence was not uniformly distributed among plant parts, but was biased towards the inoculation sites. For inoculation, conidial suspension sprayed at 1 x 10(8) conidia/ml resulted in the highest number of isolated colonies in leaf tissue, 8.5 +/- 2.02 colonies per 2 g of fresh tissue (F-4,F-19 = 2.779, P = 0.045), and reached the lowest with root treatment. Although only small differences were observed among the growth indicators, leaf spray inoculation resulted in a significant positive influence on plant growth (PC1 55.7% contributions scores = 2.645) in further Principal component analysis. As for the feeding selectivity, B. tabaci preferred uninoculated plants. In Y-tube olfactometer assay, 80.5% of adults selected uninoculated plants.

Unfertilized soil was used as a control (CF), and the experiment was set up at two distinct sites. All fertilization treatments significantly altered the prokaryotic and fungal communities in soil, whereas the influence of fertilization on the community of endophytes differed for each site. At the site with cambisol, prokaryotic and fungal endophytes were significantly shifted by MF and SF3 treatments. At the site with chernozem, neither the prokaryotic nor fungal endophytic communities were significantly associated with fertilization treatments. Fertilization significantly increased the relative abundance of the plant-beneficial bacteriaStenotrophomonas,Sphingomonasand the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In tubers, the relative abundance ofFusariumwas lower in MF-treated soil compared to CF.

To experimentally study the interactive effects of the fungal endophyte Epichloe coenophiala on salt tolerance and intraspecific competition of its host plant, tall fescue Festuca arundinacea, we subjected 15 maternal lines of each Epichloe associated (E+) and Epichloe free (E-) tall fescue to salt treatment and competition in the greenhouse and common garden. Then, to explore variation in endophyte incidence in natural populations of tall fescue, we surveyed 23 natural populations occurring on or near the Baltic Sea coast in Aland islands in southwestern Finland for endophyte incidence, distance to shore, and competitive environment. Under salinity in the greenhouse, E- plants grew larger than E+ plants, but there was no size difference in the control treatment. E- plants grew taller and were more likely to flower than E+ plants when grown in benign conditions in the common garden but not with salinity or competition. The frequency of Epichloe incidence was high (90%) in natural populations, and it decreased towards the shore and risk of salt exposure.

Red rot which is caused by Colletotrichum falcatum is the most devastating disease of sugarcane because its infestation results in significant sugarcane yield loss. The intra- and inter-specific genetic diversity, population structure and phylogenetic relationship amongst C. falcatum isolates from Bangladesh remain unclear. This information is essential for the effective management of red rot and to also develop resistant sugarcane varieties through plant breeding programmes. This paper demonstrates the phylogenetic relationship and genetic diversity of C. falcatum isolates from Bangladesh. Also, it provides baseline information that can be used to establish red rot disease management strategies for future application. Colletotrichum falcatum Went causes red rot disease in sugarcane farming in the tropical and sub-tropical regions. This disease causes significant economic loss to the sugarcane production industry. Successful disease management strategies depend on understanding the evolutionary relationship between pathogens, genetic diversity, and population structure, particularly at the intra-specific level. Forty-one isolates of C. falcatum were collected from different sugarcane farms across Bangladesh for molecular identification, phylogeny and genetic diversity study. The four genes namely, ITS-rDNA, beta-tubulin, Actin and GAPDH sequences were conducted. All the 41 C. falcatum isolates showed a 99-100% similarity index to the conserved gene sequences in the GenBank database. The phylogram of the four genes revealed that C. falcatum isolates of Bangladesh clustered in the same clade and no distinct geographical structuring were evident within the clade. The four gene sequences revealed that C. falcatum isolates from Bangladesh differed from other countries ' isolates because of nucleotides substitution at different loci. The genetic structure of C. falcatum isolates were determined using ISSR marker generated 404 polymorphic loci from 10 selected markers. The percentage of polymorphic loci was 99.01. The genetic variability at species level was slightly higher than at population level. Total mean gene diversity at the species level was 0.1732 whereas at population level it was 0.1521. The cluster analysis divided 41 isolates into four main genetic groups and the principal component analysis was consistent with cluster analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first finding on characterizing C. falcatum isolates infesting sugarcane in Bangladesh. The results of this present study provide important baseline information vis a vis C. falcatum phylogeny analysis and genetic diversity study.",NA,molecular; culture_based; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study examines the diversity and functional roles of endophytic fungi naturally colonizing the roots of an artificially established Populus yunnanensis forest and the naturally reclaimed pioneer species Coriaria sinica on an abandoned tailing dam in southwest China. Culture-independent analyses revealed that the root systems of both plant species were abundantly colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and endophytic fungi, forming rich and diverse endophytic fungal communities predominantly represented by the genera Ilyonectria, Tetracladium, Auricularia, and unclassified members of Helotiales. However, the composition of root endophytic fungal communities differed significantly between the two plant species. Using a culture-dependent approach, a total of 192 culturable endophytic fungal strains were isolated from the roots. The dominant genera included Cadophora, Cladosporium, Cyphellophora, and Paraphoma, most of which were previously identified as dark septate endophytes (DSE). Six representative DSE strains were selected for further study, and significant cadmium tolerance and various plant growth-promoting traits were observed, including the solubilization of insoluble inorganic and organic phosphorus, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production, and siderophore synthesis. In greenhouse experiments, inoculating two DSE strains mitigated the inhibitory effects of metal-polluted tailing soil on the growth of P. yunnanensis. This was achieved by reducing heavy metal uptake in roots and limiting metal translocation to the above-ground tissues, thereby promoting plant growth and adaptability. Our findings suggest that as plants reclaim metal-polluted tailings, root-associated endophytic fungal communities also undergo natural succession, playing a critical role in enhancing the host plant's tolerance to stress. Therefore, these restored root-associated fungi, particularly DSE, are essential functional components of the root systems in plants used for tailing reclamation.",root; mycorrhizal; ground tissue; ground tissues,culture_based; inoculation; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we investigated the interactions of a native grass, Achnatherum sibiricum, with both endophytic and AM fungi (Glomus mosseae, GM and Glomus etunicatum, GE) at different nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) levels. The results showed that endophyte infection significantly suppressed the colonization rates and spore density of GE, but had no effect on those of GM. Endophyte infection increased shoot biomass regardless of the nutrient conditions. The effects of AM fungi on host growth were dependent on mycorrhizal species. There was no significant interaction between endophytic fungi and GE on host growth; however, a significant interaction between endophytic fungi and GE occurred in total phenolic concentrations and P uptake. As for GM, a significant interaction among endophytic fungi, AM fungi and nutrient availability occurred in shoot growth. Under sufficient N and P conditions, endophyte infection alleviated the detrimental effects of GM colonization on host growth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

The composition of the floral volatiles of C. praecox is influenced by different blooming stages, circadian rhythms and species. However, the relationship between floral volatiles and plant endophytic fungi has not received much research attention. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing technology to compare and analyze the changes in the structure and diversity of the endophytic fungal communities in C. praecox under different circadian rhythms (7:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., and 7:00 p.m.) and in different blooming stages (unopened flowers and opened flowers). The endophytic fungi of C. praecox consisted of nine phyla, 34 classes, 79 orders, 181 families, 293 genera, and 397 species, and Ascomycota was the dominant phylum. Under a diurnal rhythm, the diversity (Chao1 and Shannon indices) of endophytic fungi gradually decreased in the unopened flowers, while an increasing and then decreasing trend was found for the opened flowers. In the different blooming stages, the endophytic fungal diversity was significantly higher at 7:00 a.m. in the unopened flowers compared to the opened flowers. Humidity was the key factors that significantly affected the endophytic fungal diversity and community. Moreover, 11 endophytic fungi were significantly positively or negatively correlated with seven floral volatiles. In conclusion, the community structure and diversity of endophytic fungi in C. praecox were affected by the different blooming stages and circadian rhythms, and a correlation effect related to floral volatiles was found, but there are other possible reasons that were not tested. This study provides a theoretical basis for elucidating the interrelationships between endophytic fungi, floral volatiles, and environmental factors in C. praecox.",flower,molecular; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is mainly produced by two endangered and overharvested Camptotheca acuminata and Nothapodytes nimmoniana plants. Endophytic fungi are promising alternative sources for CPT production. In the present study, fungi residing within explants of Ixora chinensis were isolated and their CPT-producing capability of their endophytes was verified via thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, liquid chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance analyses and compared with standards. In addition, MTT and sulforhodamine B assays were selected to test the anticancer effect. The endophytic fungi collection of 62 isolates were assigned to 11 genera, with four common genera (Diaporthe, Phyllosticta, Colletotrichum, and Phomopsis) and seven less common genera (Penicillium, Botryosphaeria, Fusarium, Pestalotiopsis, Aspergillus, and Didymella). Moreover, the anticancer activity of extracts was assessed against human lung carcinoma (A549). Among eight potential extracts, only Penicillium sp.

However, it is facing increasing endangerment due to habitat destruction and illegal collection. Therefore, the conservation of Cypripedium is becoming increasingly important. Fungi are involved in the entire life cycle of Cypripedium plants. A growing number of experiments have shown that the mycorrhizal communities of Cypripedium have also diversified under different growth environments, and most of such studies have explored the relationship between endophytic fungi in the root and the environment. Fourteen fungal and 34 bacterial phyla were detected in roots and rhizosphere samples. Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Mortierellomycota, and Chytridiomycota content were higher in endophytic fungi. Cadophora was detected in four species of Cypripedium and was dominant among the endophytic fungi, the content was up to 80.81% +/- 9.84%. Cadophora had the function of altering the structure of endophytic fungi of Cypripedium. Endophytic bacteria were mainly detected with high abundance of Pseudomonadaceae, Rhizobiaceae, Streptomycetaceae, Burkholderiaceae, and Rickettsiacea, which were endophytic in different Cypripedium plants. The diversity of rhizosphere fungi was higher than the diversity of endophytic fungi, C. shanxiense had the highest fungal community richness within four Cypripedium species and predicted that endophytic bacteria had reductive citrate cycle, 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle, and other functions. These endophytes comprise unique Cypripedium plants' microbial community structure in Changbai Mountain (China), providing a direction for further protecting wild Cypripedium resources. Understanding the structural characteristics of the endophytic fungal community of Cypripedium under the environment of Changbai Mountain provides a direction for further conservation of Cypripedium in Changbai Mountain, and exploring the functions of different types of fungi during the growth process of Cypripedium provides a theoretical basis for the subsequent exploration of the species of Cypripedium endophytes in different habitats as well as the effects on the root and soil endophytes of Cypripedium plants.",mycorrhizal; root,ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

These endophytes enhance resistance of host plant against insect herbivores mainly by productions of various alkaloid based defensive compounds in the plant tissue or through alterations of plant nutritional quality. Two endophytic fungi, i.e., Nigrospora sp. and Cladosporium sp., were isolated from Tinospora cordifolia (Thunb.) Miers, a traditional indian medicinal plant. Cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L.) plants were inoculated with these two endophytic fungi. The effect of endophyte infected and uninfected cauliflower plants were measured on the survival and development of Spodoptera litura (Fab.), a polyphagous pest. Endophyte infected cauliflower plants showed resistance to S. litura in the form of significant increase in larval and pupal mortality in both the fungi. Inhibitory effects of endophytic fungi also were observed on adult emergence, longevity, reproductive potential, as well as hatchability of eggs. Thus, it is concluded that antibiosis to S. litura could be imparted by artificial inoculation of endophytes and this could be used to develop alternative ecologically safe control strategies.",NA,culture_based; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Taxonomy of these pathogens is difficult due to their uninformative descriptions and similar asexual morphology. Based on molecular phylogenies, many species of this group were placed in various families of Diaporthales. In this study, eight species of melanconis-like fungi were isolated from Betula albosinensis, B. platyphylla (Betulaceae), Cornus controversa (Cornaceae), Corylus mandshurica (Betulaceae) and Juglans regia (Juglan-daceae) in China. These species were phylogenetically placed in three families of Diaporhthales, i.e. Juglanconis juglandina, J. oblonga (Juglanconidaceae), Melanconiella betulicola sp. nov., M. corylina sp. nov.

The endophyte was resistant to many fungicides, and only propiconazole (Tilt) reduced the level of endophyte after foliar application. In culture, the fungus was most sensitive to prochloraz (Sportak), but showed some sensitivity to propiconazole and imazalil (Fungaflor). Prochloraz completely controlled the fungus in seed, and propiconazole gave good, but not complete, control. Both chemicals produced some phytotoxic effects.

We used amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers to analyse the genetic polymorphism existing in two natural populations of Epichloe festucae. Linkage disequilibrium and the presence of clonal lineages indicated that nonrecombinant asexual reproduction predominates in both populations. However, most genetic variation detected was found to occur within populations, with only a moderate amount of genetic differentiation between populations (F-ST: 0.197).

Withania somnifera, source of pharmaceutically important withanolides biosynthesizes withaferin-A in leaves and withanolide-A in roots. To increase the in planta withanolides production, a sustainable approach needs to be explored. Here, we isolated endophytes from different parts of W. somnifera plants and their promising role in in planta withanolide biosynthesis was established in both in-vivo grown as well in in-vitro raised composite W. somnifera plants. Overall, the fungal endophytes improved photosynthesis, plant growth and biomass, and the root-associated bacterial endophytes enhanced the withanolide content in both in-vivo and in-vitro grown plants by modulating the expression of withanolide biosynthesis genes in leaves and roots. Surprisingly, a few indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-producing and nitrogen-fixing root-associated endophytes could induce the biosynthesis of withaferin-A in roots by inducing in planta IAA-production and upregulating the expression of withanolide biosynthesis genes especially MEP-pathway genes (DXS and DXR) in roots as well. Results indicate the role of endophytes in modulating the synthesis and site of withanolides production and the selected endophytes can be used for enhancing the in planta withanolide production and enriching roots with pharmaceutically important withaferin-A which is generally absent in roots.",leaf; root,culture_based; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we identified the endophytic symbiont yeasts associated with leaves of the angiosperms Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus quitensis living on King George Island, Antarctica using a culture-based approach. One hundred and twelve yeast isolates were obtained from the tissue of the different plants sampled. These yeasts were identified using sequencing of the D1/D2 domains of the LSU region of the rRNA gene as Cryptococcus victoriae, Cystobasidium laryngis, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Sporidiobolus ruineniae and Leucosporidium aff. golubevii. The psychrophilic yeast C. victoriae was the most abundant species associated with the two angiosperms. Cystobasidium laryngis occurs only in the leaves of D. antarctica. In contrast, R. mucilaginosa, S. ruineniae and L. aff. golubevii occurred only in C. quitensis. Phylogenetic analysis indicates the Antarctic endophytic yeast strains are closely related to taxa obtained from substrates located in different habitats of the world. However, the endophytic yeast C. victoriae was closely related to psychrophilic taxa isolated from Antarctica, but also from the Arctic, Alpine and Himalayan environments. The abundance of endophytic yeasts associated with Antarctic angiosperms suggests a possible symbiotic relationship with their plant hosts, which may provide shelter and growing conditions suitable for the yeasts' survival, dispersal and colonization other Antarctic environments.

However, the factors shaping their compositions are largely unknown. To elucidate the impact of various factors, 10 independent replicates of DNA extracts from each of 17 surface-sterilized leaf and stem samples were analyzed by pyrosequencing of fungal ITS1 rRNA gene amplicons. Altogether, 154 fungal OTUs (operational taxonomic units), represented by 953,385 sequences, were found in at least 2 samples from Viscum album ssp. austriacum and/or its host Pinus sylvestris. Deviating from earlier, cultivation-based assessments, the communities were dominated by OTUs related to the genus Mortierella and OTUs not assignable to a certain fungal phylum. However, Ascomycota were still the most diverse group in terms of OTU richness and already hypothesized organ and host preferences of certain endophytic Xylariaceae isolated from the Pinus-Viscum-system could be confirmed. Host species and organ type were also the major factors shaping the detected fungal communities. The two plant species clearly differed according to the endophytic fungal communities, but only stems and needles of Pinus were inhabited by significantly different fungal assemblages. Interestingly, only the 1 and 3 year old stem sections differed according to the endophytic fungal community, while differently aged leaves of both plants were indistinguishable in this regard. Size of the organs had no impact on fungal communities in Pinus, but shorter internodes and smaller leaves showed at least a tendency to differ from the corresponding larger organs in Viscum. Fungal communities also differed slightly between the two sampling sites, lying 200 km apart, and between the three sampling campaigns. Because the samples were drawn within 15 days, this finding indicates that seasonal shifts clearly outweigh aging effects in host plant with perennial leaves. The results therefore provide strong evidence against a linear development of the endophytic fungal communities in Pinus sylvestris and Viscum album over the years. The communities seem to establish themselves already in the year the respective organs emerge. Further study is required to clarify whether they predominantly establish anew each year, or if the core community persists throughout subsequent years. The most abundant endophytic OTUs are known from soil and/or dead plant material and are supposed to represent latent decomposers. The study reveals for the first time that host and/or organ preferences of putatively saprotrophic fungi are predominantly responsible for compositional differences in the endophytic fungal communities between host plants and organs. While the analyses are shown to provide rather robust results, the significance of genetic abundance, as revealed by high-throughput sequencing analyses, remains an unsettled issue. This is discussed in detail, as well as the challenges in assigning taxonomic names to OTUs.",leaf; stem; internode,molecular; culture_based; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our objectives were to compare endophyte-infected (E +) and endophyte-free (E -) tall fescue for (i) forage yield and tiller response at different cutting frequencies and heights and (ii) competition with no-till seeded alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.). Factorialized combinations of 3-wk and hay-stage harvest intervals with clipping heights of 3.8 cm (low) and 7.6 cm (high) were used with E + and E - tall fescue in a 4-yr study.

Forage yield of E + and E - Kentucky 31 was similar (P > 0.05) within a cutting treatment. When cut at 3-wk intervals, a low as compared with a high clipping height had no effect (P > 0.05) on total forage yield of E + Kentucky 31 tall fescue, but forage yield of E - Kentucky 31 and E - AU Triumph were reduced by 23 and 28%, respectively, in the fourth year.

The influence of season (rainy or dry) on the endophytic fungal community was also analyzed. Overall, 318 fungal isolates were obtained from 972 coconut leaf fragments. The rDNA ITS region was sequenced from representative species of the isolated endophytic fungi and the most common species identified were Nigrospora oryzae, Pestalotiopsis sp., and Zasmidium musae. The alpha diversity of the endophytic fungi was also calculated. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination and permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) revealed significant seasonal effects on the composition of the endophyte community. However, practically no influence was observed on the fungal communities for the different cultivars of coconut.",leaf,molecular; culture_based; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

In degenerated grasslands of northwest China endophyte (Epichlo. gansuensis) infected Achnatherum inebrians (drunken horse grass) is becoming widely distributed because of its toxicity to livestock. In this study, we investigated the ecological consequences of endophyte toxicity in this native grass, at three sites in northwest China, by comparing seed production of plant species and arthropod abundance in overgrazed grasslands with and without the presence of A. inebrians. Our findings demonstrate that the presence of endophyte infected A. inebrians reduces the loss of plant and arthropod biodiversity by providing a protected nursery free of animal grazing. Therefore, A. inebrians, typically regarded as an unwanted toxic invader by pastoralists, should be viewed as beneficial for grasslands as its presence maintains plant and arthropod biodiversity, and provides a foundation stone in the reconstruction and restoration of these grassland ecosystems.",seed,molecular; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Calanthe sieboldii Decne. is listed in the Chinese National Key Protected Wild Plants as a class I protected wild plant. To understand the community characteristics of root and soil fungi of the orchid during its reproductive seasons, we investigated the community composition, spatial and temporal dynamics, and functional characteristics of the orchid microhabitat fungi by using diversity and ecological functional analyses.Results: We discovered that there were three, seven, and four dominant fungal families in the orchid's roots, rhizoplane soil, and rhizosphere soil, respectively. Tulasnellaceae, Aspergillaceae, and Tricholomataceae were the dominant fungi in this endangered orchid's microhabitats. The closer the fungal community was to the orchid, the more stable and the less likely the community composition to change significantly over time. The fungal communities of this orchid's roots and rhizoplane soil varied seasonally, while those of the rhizosphere soil varied interannually. Saprophytic fungi were the most abundant in the orchid's fungal community, and the closer the distance to the orchid, the more symbiotic fungi were present.Conclusions: The fungi in different parts of the root microhabitat of C. sieboldii showed different spatiotemporal dynamic patterns. The fungal community near the orchid roots was relatively stable and displayed seasonal variation, while the community further away from the roots showed greater variation. In addition, compared with the soil fungi, the dominant endophytic fungi were more stable, and these may be key fungi influencing orchid growth and development. Our study on the spatiotemporal dynamics and functions of fungi provides a basis for the comprehensive understanding and utilization of orchid endophytic fungi.",root,plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

We measured growth analysis parameters, leaf net photosynthesis (P-n) chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, conductance to water vapor (g(1)) and water potential (Psi), to provide explanations for differences in biomass production under these treatments. Under high water availability, E- plants produced more biomass and had greater relative growth rates (RGR; rate of biomass gain per biomass); higher RGR of E- plants was correlated with higher P-n as well as production of less dense, presumably thinner leaves, which provided more leaf area per leaf biomass, and greater LAR (leaf area ratio; leaf area per total plant biomass). Under low water availability, E+ plants produced more aboveground biomass and had greater RGR; higher RGR of E+ plants was correlated with higher net assimilation rates, as well as production of less dense leaves and greater LAR. Infected plants tended to have lower midday P-n and g(1) in both water availability regimes. Lower P-n in E+ plants appeared primarily due to stomatal, rather than biochemical, limitations to photosynthesis. When a more severe water stress was imposed in the low water availability treatment over the last 61 days of the experiment, E+ plants tended to have higher midday P-n and g(1). Infected plants also tended to have less negative leaf Psi regardless of water availability regime. Lower g(1) and transpirational losses of E+ plants probably conserved soil moisture, such that when a more severe water stress was subsequently imposed, higher soil moisture availability allowed E+ plants to maintain higher P-n and g(1). Neotyphodium infection appears beneficial to Arizona fescue performance under low water availability and detrimental under ample water availability. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, little is known about the identities and communities of endophytic fungi inhabiting cultivated medicinal plants in the farmland ecosystem. The diversity and community composition of the endophytic fungi of cultivated medicinal plants in different hosts, tissue niches, and seasonal effects in the farmland of Northern China were examined using the next-generation sequencing technique. In addition, the ecological functions of the endophytic fungal communities were investigated by combining the sequence classification information and fungal taxonomic function annotation. A total of 1025 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of endophytic fungi were obtained at a 97% sequence similarity level; they were dominated by Dothideomycetes and Pleosporales. Host factors (species identities and tissue niches) and season had significant effects on the community composition of endophytic fungi, and endophytic fungi assembly was shaped more strongly by host than by season. In summer, endophytic fungal diversity was higher in the root than in the leaf, whereas opposite trends were observed in winter. Network analysis showed that network connectivity was more complex in the leaf than in the root, and the interspecific relationship between endophytic fungal OTUs in the network structure was mainly positive rather than negative. The functional predications of fungi revealed that the pathotrophic types of endophytic fungi decreased and the saprotrophic types increased from summer to winter in the root, while both pathotrophic and saprotrophic types of endophytic fungi increased in the leaf. This study improves our understanding of the community composition and ecological distribution of endophytic fungi inhabiting scattered niches in the farmland ecosystem. In addition, the study provides insight into the biodiversity assessment and management of cultivated medicinal plants.",root; leaf,molecular; culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Keng under high nitrogen availability,To Search,"Research on the interaction of endophytes and native grasses normally takes infection status into account, but less often considers the species of endophyte involved in the interaction. Here, we examined the effect of endophyte infection, endophyte species, nitrogen availability, and plant maternal genotype on the performance of a wild grass, Achnatherum sibiricum. Six different Epichloe-infected maternal lines of A. sibiricum were used in the study; three lines harbored Epichloe gansuensis (Eg), while three lines harbored Epichloe sibirica (Es). These endophytes are vertically transmitted, while Eg also occasionally produces stromata on host tillers. We experimentally removed the endophyte from some ramets of the six lines, with the infected (E+) and uninfected (E-) plants grown under varying levels of nitrogen availability. Eg hosts produced more aboveground biomass than Es hosts only under high nitrogen supply. Endophyte species did not show any influence on the maximum net photosynthetic rate (P-max), photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency, or total phenolics of A. sibiricum under all nitrogen conditions. However, the plant maternal genotype did influence the P-max and shoot biomass of A. sibiricum. Our results show that endophyte species influenced the shoot biomass of A. sibiricum, and this effect was dependent on nitrogen supply. As with most coevolutionary interactions, A. sibiricum that harbored Eg and Es may show pronounced geographic variation in natural habitats with increased nitrogen deposition. In addition, stroma-bearing endophyte (Eg) provides positive effects (e.g., higher biomass production) to A. sibiricum plants during the vegetative growth stage.",shoot,plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

To achieve this, we aligned mycoviral gene sequences with genomes of previously sequenced Antarctic endophytic fungi, made available by our research group and accessible via Joint Genome Institute. Our findings reveal that the most prevalent genetic regions in all endophytic fungi are homologous to Partitiviruses, Baculoviridae, and Phycodnaviridae. These regions display evidence of positive selection pressure, suggesting genetic diversity and the accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations. This phenomenon implies a crucial role for these regions in the adaptation and survival of these fungi in the challenging Antarctic ecosystems. The presence of mycoviruses in Antarctic endophytic fungi may indicate shared survival strategies between the virus and its host, shedding light on their evolutionary dynamics. This study underscores the significance of exploring mycoviruses within endophytic fungi and their contributions to genetic diversity. Future research avenues could delve into the functional implications of these conserved mycoviral genetic regions in Antarctic endophytic fungi, providing a comprehensive understanding of this intriguing association and genomic retention of viral region in fungi.",NA,molecular; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

We totally isolated 302 endophytic fungal strains, of which 215 strains are isolated from the wild soybeans and 87 are identified from cultivated soybeans. Among these endophytic fungal strains, in the roots, stems, and leaves, 24.17% were isolated from roots, 28.8% were isolated from stems, and 47.01% were isolated from leaves, respectively. Most endophytic fungal strains isolated from the wild soybean roots were the species of Fusarium genus, and the fungal strains in the stems were the species of ascomycetes and Fusarium fungi, whereas most strains in the leaves were Alternaria fungi. To analyze the taxonomy of the obtained samples, we sequenced and compared their rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. The data showed that 6 strains are putatively novel strains exhibiting <= 97% homology with the known strains. We next measured the secondary metabolites produced by the different strains and we found 11 strains exhibited high-performance synthesis of triterpenoids, phenols, and polysaccharides. Furthermore, we characterized their tolerance to abiotic stresses. The results indicated that 4 strains exhibited high tolerance to cadmium, and some strains exhibited resistance to acid, and alkali. The results of the study could facilitate the further exploration of the diversity of plant endophytic fungi and the potential applications of the fungi to practical agriculture and medicine industries.",scale; root; stem; leaf,molecular; culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Biotic and abiotic controls underlying its distribution patterns have been difficult to establish, but might be related to a greater capacity of infected plants to deal with drought and herbivory. In this study we examined the relationship between grazing intensity and symbiosis frequency in plant species differentially preferred by herbivores. In all the grass species found in the studied Patagonian steppe, we determined the infection frequency along a grazing gradient by sheep (ungrazed, moderate- and intense-grazing). Three out of five preferred species and one out of four non-preferred species presented the symbiosis. Within the group of species having the symbiosis, intense grazing decreased the infection frequency of the preferred species while the frequency of the non-preferred species remained constant. These changes of infection frequency were correlated with changes in tiller biomass of hosts suggesting that symbiosis frequency could depend on overall plant performance. Our results suggest that high grazing intensity could weaken the relationship between these endophytes and their palatable hosts, eventually making them even more vulnerable to further grazing.

The purpose of this study was to produce C. roseus callus and suspension cell biomass of good quality and quantity to improve the total alkaloids and bis-indole alkaloids. The young stem derived-callus of C. roseus variety Quang Ninh (QN) was grown on MS medium supplemented with 1.5 mg/L 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) plus 1.5 mg/L kinetin, and the growth rate increased by 67-fold after 20 days. The optimal conditions for maintaining the cell suspension culture were 150 mg/50 mL cell inoculum, a medium pH of 5.5 and a culture temperature of 25 degrees C. The low alkaloid content in the culture was compensated for by using endophytic fungi isolated from local C. roseus. Cell extracts of endophytic fungi-identified as Fusarium solani RN1 and Chaetomium funicola RN3-were found to significantly promote alkaloid accumulation. This elicitation also stimulated the accumulation of a tested bis-indole alkaloid, vinblastine. The findings are important for investigating the effects of fungal elicitors on the biosynthesis of vinblastine and vincristine, as well as other terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs), in C. roseus QN cell suspension cultures.",callus; stem,culture_based; inoculation; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Endophyte EF0801 significantly promoted growth and improved its saline-alkali resistance. We investigated growth parameters and physiological indices of endophyte EF0801-infected and control rice seedlings under sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) stress. The results showed that endophyte-infected rice seedlings showed plant height increase by 1.25-fold, root length shortening by 0.79-fold, sucrose synthase (SS), sucrose phosphosynthase (SPS), hexokinase (HXK), and alpha-glucosidase (alpha-GC) activities increased by 0.15-fold, 0.29-fold, 0.06-fold, and 1.45-fold, respectively, and beta-glucosidase (beta-GC) activity decreased by 0.12-fold. Utilizing gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technology and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology, we identified 419 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 37 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs). Comprehensive enrichment analysis of DAMs and DEGs showed that 6 DEGs and 6 DAMs were strongly correlated with the mitigating effects of endophytes on rice leaves under Na2CO3 treatment, highlighting the co-enrichment in starch and sucrose metabolism, as well as alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. The gene encoding HXK was found to be upregulated in endophyte-infected rice seedlings under Na2CO3 stress. HXK plays a key role in the conversion of fructose and glucose to fructose 6-phosphate (F-6-P) and glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P), which are important intermediates in cellular energy metabolism and glycolytic pathways, providing energy and biosynthesis of precursor substances. Our findings provide a potential perspective for unraveling the molecular response of endophyte-mediated saline-alkali resistance in rice leaves and a theoretical rationale for exploring the mechanisms of growth-promoting effects by endophytes.",root; leaf,molecular; culture_based; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Dark septate endophytes (DSE) are competent in enhancing plants' resistance to stressed environments. Nevertheless, little is known about the role of DSE in enhancing plant tolerance to Na2SO4. This study examined DSE growth and its impacts on alfalfa plants exposed to varying Na2SO4 concentrations (0%, 0.15%, 0.3%, and 0.45% (w/w)). Our findings revealed that DSE can thrive even in salt-stress environments. On the 8th day of cultivation, their biomass reached the highest level under 0.45% salt concentration. Moreover, DSE successfully colonized alfalfa roots and significantly enhanced plant growth and development across the various salt gradients. Notably, DSE made the highest contribution 68% to the total biomass of alfalfa at 0.45% salt concentration. Meanwhile, DSE significantly decreased the presence of root's Na+ across varying salt gradients. Additionally, DSE significantly increased catalase (CAT) activity at salt concentrations of 0.3% and 0.45%. Our study also revealed strong positive correlations of plant biomass with the root index, root's K+ content, and K+/ Na+ ratio, and strong negative correlations of plant biomass with root's Na+ content and soil's Na+ and SO42- contents. Structural equation modeling (SEM) demonstrated that DSE indirectly enhanced plant's shoot biomass under various salt stresses via increasing root length, decreasing root's Na+ content, and raising CAT activity, while salt indirectly reduced plant's shoot weight via reducing root length or increasing root's Na+ content or exerted a direct negative effect on plant shoot biomass. Thus, DSE are instrumental in bolstering the salt tolerance of plants, which holds strategic importance for the management of saline-alkali soils.",root; shoot,culture_based; inoculation; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

S. frugiperda larvae hide in the leaf midrib all day. To overcome the hidden larvae, pathogenic endophytic fungi are needed. The objective of this research was to molecularly identify the endophytic fungal species from South Sumatra and determine the most pathogenic species against S. frugiperda larvae. Endophytic fungal identification was based on morphological and molecular characteristics. The molecular identification was based on gene sequential analysis of Intergenic Transcribed Spacer (ITS) 1 and ITS 4. Bioassay of the endophytic fungal species was treated against the 2(nd) larval instar of S. frugiperda. Result: The results of molecular identification revealed endophytic fungal species consisted of Chaetomium sp. (GaTpeOi, JgTjPr, PiCrPga, and CaCjPga isolates), Aspergillus niger (L.) Van Tieghem (PsgTjPr, JgByU, and JaBuBys), Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (JgSPK, JaGiP, JaSpkPGA(2), JgCrJr, and JaTpOi (1) isolates), Curvularia lunata (Wakker) Boed.

In this study, we investigated the responses of major soil biological traits to both the short- and long-term effects of pesticide inputs in golf turfgrass. Overall, golf course fairways receiving regular, high-rate pesticide inputs exhibited suppression in soil biological traits involved in litter decomposition/nutrient mineralization (decomposer arthropod abundance and acid phosphatase activity), and plant nutrient uptake/plant protection (mycorrhizal fungi). In contrast, most beneficial soil biota appeared to tolerate a low level of pesticide input. In a short-term manipulative experiment we observed that monthly applications of chlorothalonil and a single application of imidacloprid, both at a medium label rate, consistently suppressed decomposer microarthropods over a 4-month period. The imidacloprid application also reduced the total infection of mycorrhizae and dark septate endophytes in roots. These results suggest that the use of pesticides as a whole does not always result in negative impacts on soil biota, but rather that the pesticide effects vary among functional groups of soil biota and are contingent upon long-term patterns of pesticide input intensity, and short-term differences in active ingredient and application program (application rate and frequency).

The root microbiome, consisting of diverse microbes, plays a crucial role in enhancing plant resilience to abiotic stressors. However, the effects of foot traffic on these microbes and the mechanisms they employ to help plant survival remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated how foot traffic affected microbial communities of the root endosphere, rhizosphere, and bulk soil in Bermudagrass (Cynodon spp.) and Zoysiagrass (Zoysia spp.) turfs. Foot traffic was simulated to mimic six professional football games per week using a modified Baldree traffic simulator. High-throughput amplicon sequencing targeting 16S rRNA for bacteria and ITS for fungi was employed to analyze microbial communities. Foot traffic slightly and significantly reduced soil moisture and inorganic nitrogen, likely due to soil compaction and associated impairment on microbial activity. Microbial alpha diversity varied across microhabitats, with no discernible effect of foot traffic. However, microbial community composition was impacted by foot traffic, being more pronounced on bacteria of the root endosphere and on fungi of the bulk soil. In light of the genetic potential predicted by PICRUSt2, foot traffic enriched a few pathways of the endophytic bacteriome, including nitrifier denitrification (PWY7084) and mannosylglycerate biosynthesis (PWY5656). This indicated that root endophytes could help turfgrass to tolerate foot traffic via controls on the concentration of nitric oxide, the signaling molecule for root growth, and mannosylglycerate, the compatible solute for protecting enzymes against osmotic stress. Foot traffic also enhanced degradation pathways of carbohydrates and 4-coumarate, the constituent of turfgrass cell walls (PWY-3801, PWY-2221, PWY-7046), indicating the faster turnover of root tissues. Along the root-rhizosphere-bulk soil continuum, the bacteriome varied substantially in composition and also exhibited contrasting genetic potentials from stress alleviation to nutrient supply in coping with grass growth. But foot traffic had little effect on the genetic potential of bacteriome in rhizosphere and bulk soil. Our findings indicated that the endophytic bacteriome was more sensitive to foot traffic than the bacteriome in the rhizosphere and bulk soil and could potentially help turf survival via influences on plant signal molecules and compatible solutes.",root; cell wall,molecular; plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

The underlying mechanisms are only partially understood and likely involve very different activities of the endophyte in different plant tissues and responses of the plant to these. We analyzed the transcriptomes of Epichloe festucae and its host, Lolium perenne, in host tissues of different function and developmental stages. The endophyte contributed approximately 10x more to the transcriptomes than to the biomass of infected tissues. Proliferating mycelium in growing host tissues highly expressed genes involved in hyphal growth. Nonproliferating mycelium in mature plant tissues, transcriptionally equally active, highly expressed genes involved in synthesizing antiherbivore compounds. Transcripts from the latter accounted for 4 % of fungal transcripts. Endophyte infection systemically but moderately increased transcription of L perenne genes with roles in hormone biosynthesis and perception as well as stress and pathogen resistance while reducing expression of genes involved in photosynthesis. There was a good correlation between transcriptome-based observations and physiological observations.

Plants have evolved intricate relationships with a diverse array of microorganisms inhabiting their roots, leaves, and other plant tissues. This microbiota mainly includes bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoans, and viruses, forming a dynamic and interconnected network within and around the plant. Through mutualistic or cooperative interactions, these microbes contribute to various aspects of plant health and development. The direct mechanisms of the plant microbiome include the enhancement of plant growth and development through nutrient acquisition. Microbes have the ability to solubilize essential minerals, fix atmospheric nitrogen, and convert organic matter into accessible forms, thereby augmenting the nutrient pool available to the plant. Additionally, the microbiome helps plants to withstand biotic and abiotic stresses, such as pathogen attacks and adverse environmental conditions, by priming the plant's immune responses, antagonizing phytopathogens, and improving stress tolerance. Furthermore, the plant microbiome plays a vital role in phytohormone regulation, facilitating hormonal balance within the plant. This regulation influences various growth processes, including root development, flowering, and fruiting. Microbial communities can also produce secondary metabolites, which directly or indirectly promote plant growth, development, and health. Understanding the functional potential of the plant microbiome has led to innovative agricultural practices, such as microbiome-based biofertilizers and biopesticides, which harness the power of beneficial microorganisms to enhance crop yields while reducing the dependency on chemical inputs.

Recent studies on endophytes have shown the beneficial roles of host-endophyte associations as protection against insect herbivores in agriculturally important grasses. However, large-scale screenings are crucial to identify animal friendly strains suitable for agricultural use. In this study we analyzed collected populations of meadow fescue (Schedonorus pratensis) from 135 different locations across Europe, 255 accessions from the United States Department of Agriculture and 96 accessions from The Nordic Genetic Resource Centre. The analysis also included representatives of S. arundinaceus, S. giganteus, and Lolium perenne. All plants were screened for the presence of Epichloe endophytes, resulting in a nursery of about 2500 infected plants from 176 different locations. Genetic diversity was investigated on 250 isolates using a microsatellite-based PCR fingerprinting assay at 7 loci, 5 of which were uncharacterized for these species. Phylogenetic and principal components analysis showed a strong interspecific genetic differentiation among isolates, and, with E. uncinata isolates, a small but significant correlation between genetic diversity and geographical effect (r = 0.227) was detected. Concentrations of loline alkaloids were measured in 218 infected meadow fescue plants. Average amount of total loline and the proportions of the single loline alkaloids differed significantly among endophyte haplotypes (P < 0.005). This study provides insight into endophyte genetic diversity and geographic variation in Europe and a reference database of allele sizes for fast discrimination of isolates. We also discuss the possibility of multiple hybridization events as a source of genetic and alkaloid variation observed in E. uncinata.",scale,molecular; culture_based; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA
10.1111/oik.03648,BellDereske_2017.pdf,Plant-fungal symbiosis affects litter decomposition during primary succession,To Search,"Microbial symbionts of plants can affect decomposition by altering the quality or quantity of host plant tissue (substrate) or the micro-environment where decomposition occurs (conditioning). In C-3 grasses, foliar fungal endophytes (Clavicipitaceae) can increase plant resistance to drought and/or produce alkaloids that reduce herbivory - effects that may also influence host litter composition and subsequent litter decomposition. We studied the effect of the endophyte Epichloe sp. on litter decomposition in the Great Lakes dunes (USA) using a reciprocal design altering endophyte presence/absence in both American beachgrass Ammophila breviligulata substrate (litter bags) and its conditioning of the decomposition microenvironment. Symbiont treatments were crossed with rain-out shelters that altered growing season precipitation. The first year of decomposition, senesced leaf substrate from A. breviligulata with Epichloe decomposed 21% faster than endophyte-free substrate. By the third year, conditioning by live symbiotic plants reduced cumulative decomposition by 33% compared to plots planted with endophyte-free plants. Of the traits we examined - litter quantity, C:N ratio, mineral composition, fungal colonization, and carbon chemistry - increased litter quantity via greater tiller production was the primary trait shift associated with endophyte symbiosis. Epichloe in A. breviligulata litter also altered litter nitrogen decomposition dynamics, as evidenced by lower nitrogen and protein content in decomposed tissue from plants that hosted the endophyte. Differences in initial litter quality and subsequent colonization by saprotrophic fungi were ruled out as key drivers. Altered precipitation had negligible effects on decomposing processes in the dunes. Grass-Epichloe symbiosis altered nutrient cycling through increasing the rate of litter decomposition when present in the litter and through reducing litter decomposition by conditioning the decomposition microenvironment. Epichloe are widespread symbionts of grasses. Thus, their effects on decomposition could be an important, but often overlooked, driver of nutrient cycling in grass-dominated ecosystems.",leaf,microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

QGS 01, an endophytic fungus isolated from the stem of Quercus gilva Blume showed high alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. alpha-Glucosidase inhibitor have the role as one of carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes to postpone absorption of glucose in the digestive organs. The alpha-glucosidase inhibitor constituents were isolated from the ethyl acetate extract of the mycellium of endophytic fungi Xylariaceae sp. QGS 01 using a bioassay-guided fractionation technique. Further separation and purification of the active fraction led to the isolation of constituents with strong inhibitory activities against alpha-glucosidase: 8-hydroxy-6,7-dimethoxy-3-methylisocoumarine (1) with inhibitory concentration (IC50) values against alpha-glucosidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae of 41.75 mu g/mL, while quercetin as the standard had an IC50 value of 4.80 mu g/mL.

10.1007/s11104-021-05235-x,Song_2022.pdf,Effects of Epichloe endophytes on litter decomposition--depending on different host species,To Search,"Aims Grass fungal endophyte symbioses are widespread in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau grasslands. The symbioses with fungal endophytes would likely have an important role in affecting ecosystem functioning (e.g., carbon and nutrients cycling, and primary productivity) It is necessary to understand the role of fungal endophytes in the litter decomposition as well as the nutrient transition of ecosystem in which endophyte host species are abundant. Methods Taking Festuca sinensis, Stipa purpurea and Achnatherum inebrians as study objects, litterbag method was used to compare the litter decomposition of these species with / without endophyte (E+ and E-). The changes in litter weight, total nitrogen, lignin and cellulose contents and their residual rate during the decomposition process were estimated in this study. The microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen of soil under litters were also compared. Results The litter from E+ F. sinensis and S. purpurea decomposed more quickly along with the cellulose compared with E-. The contents and residual rates of nitrogen and lignin in the F. sinensis and S. purpurea litters had no apparent trend of change. The microbial biomass nitrogen of soil under the E+ F. sinensis and S. purpurea litters was higher than that of the E- litters. Alternatively, the rates of decomposition and degradation of lignin were lower in the E+ A. inebrians litter than those of the E- litter. The endophyte decreased the microbial biomass carbon of soil under A. inebrians litter. Conclusions Endophytes will affect litter decomposition of host plants. Different grass-endophyte symbioses had different decomposition rates.

Here, we sequenced the genomes of Curvularia trifolii and Leptosphaerulina chartarum isolated from tobacco plants. Finally, 41.68 Mb and 37.95 Mb nuclear genomes were sequenced for C. trifolii and L. chartarum with the scaffold N50, accounting for 638.94 Kb and 284.12 Kb, respectively. Meanwhile, we obtained 68,926 bp and 59,100 bp for their mitochondrial genomes. To more accurately classify C. trifolii and L. chartarum, we extracted seven nuclear genes and 12 mitochondrial genes from these two genomes and their closely related species. The genes were then used for calculation of evolutionary rates and for phylogenetic analysis. Results showed that it was difficult to achieve consistent results using a single gene due to their different evolutionary rates, while the phylogenetic trees obtained by combining datasets showed stable topologies. It is, therefore, more accurate to construct phylogenetic relationships for endophytic fungi based on multi-gene datasets.

I.M. Johnst (Rubiaceae) is a traditional medicinal plant used in Sri Lanka for the treatment of bacterial infections. Due to its rich endophytic fungi content, it was postulated that endophytically-produced specialized metabolites may be responsible for its purported antibacterial effects. To test this hypothesis, eight pure endophytic fungal cultures were isolated from G. repens then extracted and screened for antibacterial activity in a disc diffusion assay against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Large scale culturing, extraction, and purification of the most active fungal extract, obtained from Xylaria feejeensis, led to the isolation of 6 ',7 '-didehydrointegric acid (1), 13-carboxyintegric acid (2), and four known compounds including integric acid (3). Compound 3 was isolated as the key antibacterial component (MIC = 16 mu g/mL against Bacillus subtilis, 64 mu g/mL against Methicillin-Resistant S. aureus). Compound 3 and its analogues were devoid of hemolytic activity up to the highest tested concentration of 45 mu g/mL. This study demonstrates that specialized metabolites produced by endophytic fungi may contribute to the biological activity of some medicinal plants.

Understanding factors that generate context-dependency in protection symbioses will improve predictions on when and where symbionts are most likely to affect the ecology and evolution of host species and their associated communities. Of particular relevance are changes in abiotic contexts that are projected to accompany global warming. For example, increased drought stress can enhance the benefits of fungal symbiosis in plants, which may have multi-trophic consequences for plant-associated arthropods. Here, we tracked colonization of fungal endophyte-symbiotic and aposymbiotic Poa autumnalis (autumn bluegrass) by Rhopalosiphum padi (bird-cherry-oat aphids) and their parasitoids (Aphelinus sp.) following manipulations of soil water levels. Endophyte symbiosis significantly reduced plant colonization by aphids. Under low water, symbiotic plants also supported a significantly higher proportion of aphids that were parasitized by Aphelinus and had higher above-ground biomass than aposymbiotic plants, but these endophyte-mediated effects disappeared under high water. Thus, the multi-trophic consequences of plant-endophyte symbiosis were contingent on the abiotic context, suggesting the potential for complex responses in the arthropod community under future climate shifts.",NA,molecular; culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

To bypass limitations of the culturing methods and provide a more realistic diversity estimate, we employed and assessed a PCR-DGGE based method coupled with rDNA phylogenetic sequence analyses to characterize fungal taxa associated with pine needles. Fresh (living) and decayed needles from three hosts of the Pinaceae (Keteleeria fortunei, Pinus elliottii and P. massoniana) were examined. Morphological studies reveal that the most abundant species associated with decayed needles were Cladosporium cladosporioides and an unidentified Trichoderma species followed by Gliocephalotrichum sp., Gliocladium sp., Lophodermium pinastri, Paecilomyces varioti, Phaeostalagmus cyclosporus and a Phoma sp, which are commonly occurring fungi. Community genomic data from freshly collected and decayed pine needles recovered 40 operational taxonomic units, which appear to be mostly undetected members of the natural fungal consortium. Sequence analyses revealed a number of phylotypes or ""species"" that were not recovered using traditional morphological and cultural approaches previously used. Phylogenetic data from partial 18S rDNA sequence data reveal that most phylotypes represent potential novel phylogenetic fungal lineages with affinities to the Dothideomycetes, Leotiomycetes, Lecanoromycetes and Sordariomycetes and were not identical to previously known endophytes or saprobes. Although the major ecological roles of these phylotypes in pine needles are still enigmatic, this study provides new insights in hidden fungal diversity that mycologists are possibly ignoring given the discrepancies associated with available methods. To what extent do previously recovered identified species (either as saprobes or endophytes) from morphological or culturing studies act as pioneer decomposers or constitute an integral part of endophytic community warrants further investigation.",NA,molecular; culture_based; microscopy; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Kuntze is a fungus which induces strip-cankers on beech, commonly referred to as charcoal canker. The symptoms of infection are visible on the host tree's bark as elongated, blackish bark lesions on the trunk and branches. Recent years have shown that, due to climate change causing local epidemics, the species is increasing its economic impact in Mediterranean regions. Until recently, B. nummularia was considered rare and uncommon in central Europe. However, in the last few years it has been noticed more often, mostly in coniferous trees, which are out of B. nummularia's host range. A similar situation has been observed with the closely related species Biscogniauxia mediterranea (De Not.) Kuntze, which prior to 2017 had not been observed in central Europe at all. This study shows the genetic diversity of mid-European strains of Biscogniauxia spp. (based on the ITS, TEF1, TUB2 and ACT regions) and, as the first in Europe, presents a molecular investigation of this species isolated from coniferous trees.

Endophytes can contribute in providing plant supplements, conflicting with pathogens, or directly influencing the growth and development of plants through synthesis of phytohormones. The present study aimed to explore the diversity of endophytic fungi from different parts of the three healthy halophytic plants i.e., Solanum surattense Burm. f., Chenopodium album L. and Zizyphus nummularia (Burm. f). As sa result, twenty-two endophytic fungi mostly belonging to ascomycetes were isolated from 92 samples with an overall colonization frequency of 23.02%. The endophytic fungi showed a relatively high percentage of colonization frequency (25%) in roots as compared to other parts. The isolated fungal strains were tested for salt tolerance and for their ability to produce plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Out of 12 different strains, five strains have salt tolerance potential and eight strains have shown to produce IAA in culture media. Further the isolated strains were also screened for their growth promoting activities such as 1-aminocyclopropane1-carboxylate deaminase, flavonoids, phenol, solubilize phosphate and to produce siderophores.",root,culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the degree of genetic diversity of endophytic Diaporthe has not yet been fully investigated. In this paper, a survey of endophytes from 28 plants in southeast China yielded 116 Diaporthe isolates, out of which 64 haplotypes were determined using DnaSP ver. 5.1 based on alignment result of internal transcribed spacer of ribosomal nucleotide sequences (ITS rDNA). Many haplotypes turned out to be quite different from known species and displayed high diversity. Among them, 14 strains from 5 discriminating terminal clades were selected to go through further analysis according to partial sequence of translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1-alpha) and again they got separated from others. The following multi-gene phylogenetic analysis based on ITS rDNA, tef1-alpha, beta tubulin and calmodulin grouped eight most discrepant strains into three distinctive clusters, cluster 1 (Rc001, Eu004 and Eu009), cluster 2 (ZJWCF252, Sjm001 and Ac001) and cluster 3 (Pcs013 and Sfp005) respectively with high support values. These clusters above represent three potentially novel species.

Unlike other fungi, Pc is resistant to chitosan, a deacetylated form of chitin, used in agriculture as a biopesticide to control plant pathogens. In the present work, we show that chitosan increases Meloidogyne javanica egg parasitism by P. chlamydosporia. Using antibodies specific to the Pc enzymes VCP1 (a subtilisin), and SCP1 (a serine carboxypeptidase), we demonstrate chitosan elicitation of the fungal proteases during the parasitic process. Chitosan increases VCP1 immuno-labelling in the cell wall of Pc conidia, hyphal tips of germinating spores, and in appressoria on infected M. javanica eggs. These results support the role of proteases in egg parasitism by the fungus and their activation by chitosan. Phylogenetic analysis of the Pc genome reveals a large diversity of subtilisins (S8) and serine carboxypeptidases (S10). The VCP1 group in the S8 tree shows evidence of gene duplication indicating recent adaptations to nutrient sources. Our results demonstrate that chitosan enhances Pc infectivity of nematode eggs through increased proteolytic activities and appressoria formation and might be used to improve the efficacy of M. javanica biocontrol.

However, most previous research has focused on Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae, and there are few reports on whether other EPF can enhance resistance against pests via endogenous colonization. Herein, an EPF strain was isolated from diseased larvae of Spodoptera litura in a soybean field, and subjected to genome-wide sequencing at the chromosomal level. The pathogenicity of the isolate toward various pest insects was evaluated, and the ability to colonize plants and induce resistance against phytopathogens and insect pests was tested. RESULTS: The purified isolate was identified as M. rileyi and designated MrS1Gz1-1. Biological assays revealed its strong pathogenicity toward five insect pests belonging to Lepidoptera and Hemiptera. Furthermore, the strain inhibited the growth of soil-borne plant disease caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in vitro. It colonized plants as an endophyte via soil application, thereby inducing plant resistance-related genes against phytopathogen infection, and it disrupted the feeding selectivity of S. litura larvae. CONCLUSION: M. rileyi MrS1Gz1-1 has potential as a broad-spectrum microbial control agent that can induce resistance against phytopathogens and insect pests feeding as an endotype.

Evidence for the distribution and ecological role of these fungal alkaloids, however, is lacking or incomplete for many host species and growth forms. Here we report on the identity of the fungal endophytes and quantities of alkaloids present in the leaves and seeds of the arborescent morning glory, Ipomoea murucoides (Convolvulaceae). Young folded leaf samples taken from the wild, harbored mycelium of one of two fungal taxa wrapped around the leaves' glandular trichomes. Most trees harbored the swainsonine producing Ceramothyrium (Chaetothyriales) fungi while a few trees were found to harbor a Truncatella (Xylariales) species, suggesting endophyte replacement. Seeds had higher concentrations of the indolizidine alkaloid swainsonine than leaves. Additionally, seeds from trees harboring Ceramothyrium fungi exhibited less bruchid damage and had higher concentrations of swainsonine than seeds from trees harboring Truncatella fungi. Five sesquiterpenes were detected in the leaf trichomes in both Ceramothyrium and Truncatella colonized trees. The seed content of the tropane alkaloids, tropine and tropinone, did not differ significantly among the two fungal symbionts. It is likely that the host allocates the defensive chemicals from leaves to seeds, protecting them from seed predators such as bruchid beetles. Overall, our field data show that Ipomoea species provides an interesting opportunity to study vertical and horizontal fungal symbiont transmissions.",leaf; seed; glandular trichome; trichome; leaf trichome; leaf trichomes,inoculation; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the effect of sex on plant-endophyte interactions in response to environmental stressors remains unknown. RNA-seq integrated with ITS analysis was applied to reveal the potential mechanisms underlying the sex-specific responses of Taxus mairei to ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation. Results Enrichment analysis suggested that sex influenced the expression of several genes related to the oxidation-reduction system, which might play potential roles in sex-mediated responses to UV-B radiations. ITS-seq analysis clarified the effects of UV-B radiation and sex on the composition of endophytic fungal communities. Sex influenced various secondary metabolic pathways, thereby providing chemicals for T. mairei host to produce attractants and/or inhibitors to filter microbial taxa. Analysis of fungal biomarkers suggested that UV-B radiation reduced the effect of sex on fungal communities. Moreover, Guignardia isolate #1 was purified to investigate the role of endophytic fungi in sex-mediated responses to UV-B radiation. Inoculation with spores produced by isolate #1 significantly altered various oxidation-reduction systems of the host by regulating the expression of APX2, GST7 NCED1, ZE1, CS1, and CM1.

Twenty pairs of mature CD-1 mice were allocated to dietary treatments containing 50% (wt/wt) rodent chow plus either 50% endophyte-infected tall fescue seed or seed that was not infected. At parturition, six pups of approximately equal BW and sex ratio were selected from each litter and fostered to each of the dams for suckling, resulting in four suckling groups. Pups born to dams fed the infected diet weighed less at birth and experienced developmental delays in BW gain and in eye opening (16.7 vs. 13.7 d) regardless of the foster dam's diet. Pups born of dams fed the diet that was not infected attained the greatest growth rates and weaning weights; those suckling dams fed the diet that was not infected demonstrated the largest gains. Pups born of and suckled by dams fed the infected diet demonstrated greatly reduced growth rates and weaning weights compared with the other groups. Results suggest that the congenital effect on pups born of dams fed an infected diet was significant in lowering the growth rate of the pups during suckling. The dam's ability to provide nourishment to the pups also was lowered when fed this diet.

Gentiana straminea Maxim. is an important traditional Tibetan herb used to treat a range of diseases in the Qinghai-Tibetan region. However, the diversity and community structure of endophytic fungi in the species remain poorly understood. In this study, a total of 944 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated from the roots, stems, and leaves of G. straminea from four different altitudes. A total of 87 OTUs were identified through sequence alignment, comprising 6 classes, 15 orders, 25 families, and 44 genera. The colonization rate and diversity of endophytic fungi were affected by tissue type and altitude. With the exception of Xining, the endophytic fungi colonization rate of tissues was roots>leaves>stems. Moreover, the alpha-diversity of endophytic fungi among different tissues was leaves>stems>roots. Notably, the phylogenetic diversity index in leaves was significantly higher than that in roots. In addition, the colonization rate and diversity of endophytic fungi in leaves and stems demonstrated a decline with the increasing altitude. The beta-diversity analysis revealed significant differences in the endophytic fungi of G. straminea at varying altitudes. In roots, geographical factors, such as latitude and longitude, were the primary drivers of variation, whereas environmental factors, including temperature and precipitation, had a greater influence on endophytes in leaves and stems. In addition, the results of the endophytic fungi association preference, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), and co-network analysis indicated that these differential endophytic fungi may play a significant role in the authenticity and stress resistance of G. straminea.",root; stem; leaf,molecular; culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA
10.7717/peerj.9514,Roodi_2020.pdf,"Methylobacterium, a major component of the culturable bacterial endophyte community of wild Brassica seed",To Search,"Background: Plants are commonly colonized by a wide diversity of microbial species and the relationships created can range from mutnalistic through to parasitic. Microorganisms that typically form symptomless associations with internal plant tissues are termed endophytes. Endophytes associate with most plant species found in natural and managed ecosystems. They are extremely important plant partners that provide improved stress tolerance to the host compared with plants that lack this symbiosis. Plant domestication has reduced endophyte diversity and therefore the wild relatives of many crop species remain untapped reservoirs of beneficial microbes. Brassica species display immense diversity and consequently provide the greatest assortment of products used by humans from a single plant genus important for agriculture, horticulture, bioremediation, medicine, soil conditioners, composting crops, and in the production of edible and industrial oils. Many endophytes are horizontally transmitted, but some can colonize the plant's reproductive tissues, and this gives these symbionts an efficient mechanism of propagation via plant seed (termed vertical transmission). Methods: This study surveyed 83 wild and landrace Brassica accessions composed of 14 different species with a worldwide distribution for seed-originating bacterial endophytes. Seed was stringently disinfected, sown within sterile tissue culture pots within a sterile environment and incubated. After approximately 1-month, direct isolation techniques were used to recover bacterial endophytes from roots and shoots of symptomless plants. Bacteria were identified based on the PCR amplification of partial 16S rDNA gene sequences and annotated using the BLASTn program against the NCBI rRNA database. A diversity index was used as a quantitative measure to reflect how many different bacterial species there were in the seed-originating microbial community of the Brassica accessions sampled. Results: Bacterial endophytes were recovered from the majority of the Brassica accessions screened. 16S rDNA gene sequencing identified 19 different bacterial species belonging to three phyla, namely Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria with the most frequently isolated species being Methylobacterium fujisawaense, Stenotrophomonas rhizophila and Pseudomonas lactis. Methylobacterium was the dominant genus composing 56% of the culturable isolated bacterial community and was common in 77% of accessions possessing culturable bacterial endophytes. Two selected isolates of Methylobacterium significantly promoted plant growth when inoculated into a cultivar of oilseed rape and inhibited the growth of the pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans in dual culture. This is the first report that investigates the seed-originating endophytic microorganisms of wild Brassica species and highlights the Brassica microbiome as a resource for plant growth promoting bacteria and biological control agents.",seed; root; shoot,molecular; culture_based; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

The family Bromeliaceae is a monophyletic group of plants native to the Neotropics. Epiphytic bromeliads form associations with distinct groups of organisms but their relationship with foliar fungal endophytes remain underexplored. In this study we examined the relationship of foliar fungal endophytes to host photosynthetic pathways and associated ecophysiological traits. We sampled the fungal endophyte communities of 67 host individuals in six epiphytic bromeliad species differing in C-3 and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) photosynthetic pathways. We tested whether endophyte assemblages were associated with ecophysiological leaf traits related to host photosynthetic pathways. Our results indicate that (1) C-3 and CAM bromeliads host dissimilar endophyte assemblages, (2) endophyte communities in C-3 bromeliads are characterized by variable relative abundances of fungal orders; conversely, CAM associated endophyte communities were characterized by consistent relative abundances of fungal orders, and (3) endophyte communities in bromeliads are distributed along a continuum of leaf toughness and leaf water content. Taken together, our study suggests that host physiology and associated ecophysiological traits of epiphytic bromeliads may represent biotic filters for communities of fungal endophytes in the tropics.",leaf,ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here we characterize Epichloe canadensis sp. nov., a hybrid species inhabiting the grass species Elymus canadensis native to North America. Three distinct morphotypes were identified that were separated into two groups by molecular phylogenetic analysis. Sequence analysis of the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tefA) and beta-tubulin (tubB) genes revealed two copies in all isolates examined. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that allele 1 of each gene was derived from Epichloe amarillans and allele 2 from Epichloe elymi. This is the first documentation of an interspecific hybrid endophyte derived from parents of strictly North American origins. Alkaloid gene profiling using primers specific to genes in the peramine, loline, indole-diterpene and ergot alkaloid pathways may indicate chemotypic variation in the ergot alkaloid and loline pathways between the assigned morphotypes. All isolates have the gene enabling the production of peramine but lack genes in the indole-diterpene biosynthesis pathway.

10.1890/06-1958.1,Koh_2007.pdf,Herbivory mediates grass-endophyte relationships,To Search,"Endophytic fungi are plant symbionts living asymptomatically within plant tissues. Neotyphodium spp., which are asexual vertically transmitted systemic fungal endophytes of cool-season grasses, are predicted to be plant mutualists. These endophytes increase host plant resistance to environmental stresses and/or increase the production of alkaloid-based herbivore deterrents. The ubiquity of this defense mutualism is unclear, and a variety of alternative mechanisms may explain the observed variation in infection rates, levels of deterrence, and the maintenance of asexual endophytes in grass populations. We found that grass-endophyte interactions are variable and ordered along an herbivory gradient in an undisturbed subarctic alpine ecosystem. Native grass populations in grazed sites had significantly greater frequency of Neotyphodium infection compared to ungrazed sites. Tillers from grazed sites had significantly higher hyphal densities compared to ungrazed sites. The ability of grass-Neotyphodium constituents to deter vertebrate herbivory in natural systems is thought to be rare. In grazed meadows, we showed that endophyte infection resulted in the deterrence of grazing by native vertebrate herbivores. However, the same herbivores did not distinguish between infected and uninfected grass harvested from ungrazed areas. These results demonstrate that the relationship between vertically transmitted endophytes and grasses in the alpine tundra vary greatly within populations. This may be based in part on defense mutualism and is consistent, under varying levels of herbivory, with the predictions of optimal defense theory.",NA,inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we analyzed the effects of S. indica inoculation on root colonization rate, growth rate, photosynthetic parameters, mineral element concentrations and related gene expression, and sugar concentrations and expression of their transporter genes in four-year-old C. oleifera trees in the field. The results showed that the root colonization rate of C. oleifera increased from 3.37% to 9.42% following being inoculated with S. indica. Inoculation with S. indica significantly increased the plant height (46.81%), net photosynthetic rate (69.16%), nitrogen balance index (14.44%), chlorophyll index (21.08%), leaf K (7.4%), leaf Ca (13.52%), root P (17.75%), root K (12.80%), soil NH4+-N (17.78%), available K (26.66%), Olsen-P (184.30%), easily extractable glomalin-related soil protein (39.26%), and soil organic carbon (16.25%) concentrations compared to the uninoculated treatment. Inoculation with S. indica also significantly up-regulated the expression of CoHKT1;1 and CoCAX1;2 in the leaves and roots and CoPht1;1, CoPht1;2, and CoPht1;3 in the leaves. Plants inoculated with S. indica also presented significantly higher leaf glucose, fructose, and sucrose concentrations, accompanied by up-regulated expression of CoSWEET2a, CoSWEET7, CoSWEET9b, CoSWEET17a, and CoSWEET17b.

With the important role of stoichiometry in many ecological processes, this study investigated the effect of an asexual EpichloA << endophyte on the nutrient stoichiometry of wild barley (Hordeum brevisubulatum) under salt stress. Plants with (E+) and without endophyte (E-) were subjected to different NaCl treatments (0, 150, 300, 450 and 600 mM). After 15 days, the dry weight as well as the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) contents in the plants were determined. Salt stress significantly reduced the growth and nutrient absorption of wild barley. The biomass as well as the N, P and K+ contents were higher while the Na+ content was lower in E+ plants than in E- plants. However, there was no significant effect on C content between E+ and E- plants. The findings also showed that E+ plants had lower ratios of C:N, C:P, Na+:K+ and a higher ratio of N:P than E- plants. The EpichloA << endophyte played an important role in maintaining the growth of the host plants by promoting nutrient absorption and adjusting the ionic balance.

However, the relationship between DSE resources and medicinal plants is still unclear. Here, we investigated DSE colonisation and species composition associated with roots of 25 medicinal plants collected from Anguo Medicine Planting Site in the farmland habitat, northern China in May 2017 using morphological characteristics and ITS sequencing. Typical DSE colonisation structures were observed in the roots of 25 medicinal plants. Total DSE colonisation was in the range of 2.22-100% and was significantly and positively correlated with soil organic matter, urease, and phosphatase. Host species purely explained 80.8%, 74.0%, and 79.0% of the observed variation in hyphal, microsclerotial, and total DSE colonisation, respectively. Of the 14 DSE taxa isolated from all 25 medicinal plant roots, six species were reported here for the first time in medicinal plants. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that DSE colonisation and species composition significantly differed between different plant species. The DSE colonisation and species composition were predominately affected by plant identity than by soil factors. We conclude that the dynamics of DSE in the roots of medicinal plants exhibited a highly correlated plant species pattern, which further correlated with soil nutrient availability and enzymatic activity. This research provides a basis for further understanding of the ecological functions of DSE and their roles in the promotion of yield and quality of medicinal plants in the farmland ecosystems.",root,molecular; culture_based; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods and ResultsConclusionsEndophytic fungi isolated from T. ammi were screened for alpha glucosidase inhibitory activity. Maximum inhibition (96%) was observed in an isolate AZ-9, identified to be Exophiala spinifera on morphological and molecular basis. Production of fungal metabolites was carried out in malt extract broth followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. Brown coloured gummy residue obtained after evaporation of ethyl acetate was partially soluble in water yielding white precipitates. The precipitate exhibiting -glucosidase inhibitory activity was purified by repeated washing and centrifugation. The insecticidal activity of inhibitor was evaluated on Spodoptera litura (Fab.) by feeding this pest on diet amended with inhibitor. It resulted in significant larval mortality as well as deformities in emerging adults. A reduction invivo digestive enzyme activity was also observed. Nutritional analysis revealed the toxic effect of AZ-9 inhibitor on various food utilization parameters of S. litura. A significant reduction was recorded in relative growth and consumption rate of S. litura. This is the first report on production of an alpha glucosidase inhibitor from E. spinifera with insecticidal activity.

The aim of this study was to increase the speed and accuracy of Cladosporium spp. spore counting using UV-visible spectrophotometry based on the regression model in a water suspension. Spores of C. ramotenellum AM55, C. limoniforme Br15, C. tenuissimum K15 and C. cladosporioides Ld13 fungi were diluted in sterile distilled water several times. Spore concentration/ml (SC) was counted with a hemocytometer. The spectrophotometer visible light absorption (ABS) was measured under 14 wavelengths from 300 to 950 nm for each dilution. The results showed that the morphological variation of the spores greatly affect the determination of the suitable wavelength. 650, 750, 500 and 400 nm wavelengths had the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) values respectively for C. ramotenellum AM55, C. limoniforme Br15, C. tenuissimum K15 and C. cladosporioides Ld13 on the linear regression model. R-2 values were 0.9874, 0.9647, 0.8856 and 0.9711 respectively, for the 650, 750, 500 and 400 nm wavelengths. The linear equation of SC = 10(7) x ABS-133,040 with the highest R-2 value of 0.9532 had the best fit under a combinatorial regression model where SC and ABS of all Cladosporium spp. were presented. The proposed linear regression models can be used under in vivo and in vitro conditions for medicine or plant pathology studies which certainly increase the accuracy and speed of the future experiments compared to the hemocytometer method.

In October 2023, the foliage of G. biloba on the campus of Nanjing Forestry University exhibited leaf blight. Black-brown necrotic spots were observed on a large number of leaves, with a disease incidence of 86%. After isolating a fungus from symptomatic leaves, pathogenicity was tested to satisfy Koch's postulates. Using morphological features and multi-gene phylogenetic analyses of an internal transcribed spacer (ITS), elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-alpha), and beta-tubulin (beta-tub), the isolates YKB1-1 and YKB1-2 were identified as Nigrospora oryzae. N. oryzae was previously reported as an endophyte of G. biloba. However, this study shows it to be pathogenic to G. biloba, causing leaf spots. Two endophytic bacteria were isolated from asymptomatic leaves of diseased G. biloba trees, and their molecular identification was performed using 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA). GBB1-2 was identified as Bacillus altitudinis, while GBB1-5 was identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens.

However, the response of bacterial and fungal communities interacting with plants to an increase in the water regime in natural ecosystems has yet to be extensively studied. To address this matter, we studied the response of rhizospheric and root endophytic microbial communities to simulated intense precipitation in a natural desert environment. We used amplicon sequencing to identify bacterial (16S) and fungal (ITS) communities of Haloxylon salicornicum (Moq) Bunge ex Boiss., a pivotal plant species in natural ecosystems with a high potential for land restauration. Bacterial community composition included mostly Actinobacteriota in roots and Chloroflexi in rhizospheres, whereas fungal communities were mostly represented by Ascomycota. The decomposition of beta diversity revealed a significant share of i) turnover for bacteria between compartments, ii) nestedness for fungi according to compartments, and iii) nestedness for bacteria in both rhizosphere and roots according to watering. Differential abundances analyses between watering conditions identified respectively i) 29 and 37 differentially abundant bacterial families, and ii) 7 and 6 differentially abundant fungal families for rhizosphere and roots. Watering induced a rapid response from little characterized microbiota potentially involved in nutrient recycling, such as rhizobia and dark septate endophytes. These results provided evidence of the fundamental role of rare and intense precipitation in modifying the microbial composition of roots and rhizosphere of one desert plant species. Moreover, little studied taxa potentially crucial to the plant health in desert environments such as dark septate endophytes and Planctomycetota were identified as pioneer taxa colonizing freshly emitted roots.

An objective of this study was to investigate the contribution of the mutualistic fungal endophyte Epichloe gansuensis to leaf cuticular wax of Achnatherum inebrians under different soil moisture availability. Through a pot experiment and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, our results indicated that the hydrocarbons were the dominant components of leaf cuticular wax, and the proportion of alcohols, aldehydes, amines, and ethers varied with the presence or absence of E. gansuensis and different soil moisture availability. Amines and ethers are unique in endophyte-free (EF) A. inebrians plants and endophyte-infected (EI) A. inebrians plants, respectively. By transcriptome analysis, we found a total of 13 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to cuticular biosynthesis, including FabG, desB, SSI2, fadD, BiP, KCS, KAR, FAR, and ABCB1. A model is proposed which provides insights for understanding cuticular wax biosynthesis in the association of A. inebrians plants with E. gansuensis.

Human-induced nitrogen input leads to a high NH4+/ NO3- ratio in soil. However, relatively few studies have investigated the effects of different nitrogen sources on forest plant-microbial symbionts. In this study, the effects of four nitrogen sources, N free, NH4Cl, L-glutamic acid, and Na(NO3)2 (N-, NH4+-N, Org-N, and NO3--N) on four fungal species, Suillus granulatus (Sg), Pisolithus tinctorius (Pt), Pleotrichocladium opacum (Po), and Pseudopyrenochaeta sp. (Ps), which were isolated from the roots of Pinus tabulaeformis, were studied in vitro. The effects of inoculation with the four fungi on the growth performance, nutrient uptake and nitrogen metabolism-related enzymes of Pinus tabuliformis under different nitrogen source conditions were subsequently studied.ResultsThe biomass and N concentration of the Sg and Po strains were the highest under the NO3--N treatment, while the biomass and N concentration of the Pt and Ps strains were significantly greater under the NH4+-N and NO3--N treatments than under the Org-N and N- treatments. All four fungi could effectively colonize the roots of P. tabuliformis and formed a symbiotic relationship with it. Under all nitrogen conditions, the inoculation of the four fungi had positive effects on the growth, root development and nutrient concentration of the P. tabuliformis seedlings. Under the Org-N and NO3--N treatments, the nitrate reductase (NR) activity of the inoculated plants was significantly greater than that of the noninoculated control (CK) plants. Under all nitrogen conditions, the glutamine synthetase (GS) activity of the inoculated plants was significantly greater than that of the CK plants.ConclusionsThe four fungi can establish good symbiotic relationships with P. tabuliformis seedlings and promote their growth and development under different nitrogen source treatments.",root,culture_based; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Inoculation of crop plants with fungal endophytes is a cost-effective way to improve salt tolerance. We used metabolomics to study how Trichoderma harzianum T-22 alleviates NaCl-induced stress in two barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars, Gairdner and Vlamingh, with contrasting salinity tolerance. GC-MS was used to analyse polar metabolites and LC-MS to analyse lipids in roots during the early stages of interaction with Trichoderma. Inoculation reversed the severe effects of salt on root length in sensitive cv. Gairdner and, to a lesser extent, improved root growth in more tolerance cv. Vlamingh. Biochemical changes showed a similar pattern in inoculated roots after salt treatment. Sugars increased in both cultivars, with ribulose, ribose, and rhamnose specifically increased by inoculation. Salt stress caused large changes in lipids in roots but inoculation with fungus greatly reduced the extent of these changes. Many of the metabolic changes in inoculated cv. Gairdner after salt treatment mirror the response of uninoculated cv. Vlamingh, but there are some metabolites that changed in both cultivars only after fungal inoculation. Further study is required to determine how these metabolic changes are induced by fungal inoculation.",root,inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

As yet only one seagrass has been shown to form a specific root-fungus symbiosis that resembles those occurring in terrestrial plants, namely the dominant long-lived Mediterranean species Posidonia oceanica (Alismatales: Posidoniaceae) forming a dark septate (DS) endophytic association with the ascomycete Posidoniomyces atricolor (Pleosporales: Aigialaceae). Using stereomicroscopy, light and scanning electron microscopy, and DNA cloning, here we describe a novel root-fungus symbiosis in the Indo-Pacific seagrass Thalassodendron ciliatum (Alismatales: Cymodoceaceae) from a site in the Gulf of Aqaba in the Red Sea. Similarly to P. oceanica, the mycobiont of T. ciliatum occurs more frequently in thinner roots that engage in nutrient uptake from the seabed and forms extensive hyphal mantles composed of DS hyphae on the root surface. Contrary to P. oceanica, the mycobiont occurs on the roots with root hairs and does not colonize its host intraradically. While the cloning revealed a relatively rich spectrum of fungi, they were mostly parasites or saprobes of uncertain origin and the identity of the mycobiont thus remains unknown. Symbioses of seagrasses with fungi are probably more frequent than previously thought, but their functioning and significance are unknown. Melanin present in DS hyphae slows down their decomposition and so is true for the colonized roots. DS fungi may in this way conserve organic detritus in the seagrasses' rhizosphere, thus contributing to blue carbon sequestration in seagrass meadows.",root; hair; root hair,molecular; microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, information regarding naturally occurring P. tenuiflorus plant associated endophytes among different organs of host is limited. Endophytic bacteria were isolated from root, stem, and leaves of P. tenuiflorus plant. Among 28 endophytic bacterial isolates from different organs of P. tenuiflorus plant, 8 isolates were identified by partial sequencing of their 16S rRNA gene. The isolated endophytic bacteria were Bacillus sp., Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus licheniformis, Micrococcus luteus, Paenibacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. The most isolates that exhibited extracellular enzymatic activity were belonged to the genus Bacillus. Furthermore, Bacillus sp. (HE613660) exhibited the stronger activities in extracellular enzymes such as amylase, esterase, lipase, protease, pectinase, xylanase, and cellulase than other strains. Considerable antimicrobial activities against a panel of human pathogenic microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Proteus mirabilis, and Candida albicans) were recorded using crude extracts of the collected endophytic strains.",root; stem; leaf,molecular; culture_based; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Dark septate endophytes (DSEs) are a group of root-associated fungi known to enhance plant stress tolerance. This study aimed to explore the role of DSE fungus S16 in improving drought tolerance in sweet cherry seedlings and to reveal the underlying molecular and microbial mechanisms through a multi-omics approach. Physiological analysis showed that S16 inoculation improved plant growth, increased relative water content, photosynthetic rate, and antioxidant enzyme activities, while reducing ion leakage and oxidative damage under drought conditions. Metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses identified key metabolic pathways, particularly flavonoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, as being significantly activated, with upregulation of genes such as PAL, 4CL and CHS, and increased accumulation of metabolites like cinnamic acid (CA) and flavonoid derivatives. Exogenous application of CA at 0.5 mM further enhanced drought resistance by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, increasing proline accumulation, and boosting antioxidant enzyme activities. Rhizosphere microbiota analysis revealed that S16 symbiosis and CA treatment under drought conditions increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria, such as members of Sphingomonas, Stenotrophobacter and Parcubacteria, while promoting the dominance of Humicola and Fusarium fungi. These findings provide multi-omics evidence for the role of S16 in enhancing drought tolerance in sweet cherry, offering a theoretical basis for the application of DSE fungi in sustainable fruit tree production.",root; fruit,molecular; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Unfortunately, a side effect of endophyte infection can be the production of alkaloids, including Lolitrem B and ergovaline, that produce toxic effects in animals. A significant 4.6 litre decrease in milk production in a herd of Holstein-Friesian dairy cows was associated with high concentrations of ergovaline in ryegrass silage. Simultaneously, milk SCC increased significantly over a comparable period and reproductive performance declined. Body condition score and coat condition of cows were adversely affected. Unique aspects of this Case report include; very stable production of the herd over a period of years before and after cessation of feeding silage containing high concentrations of ergovaline; the presence of high concentrations of ergovaline in the silage; and a controlled diet that reduced the risks of variation in feed availability and other sources of toxins.

A total of 233 endophytic fungal isolates were obtained and classified into 42 different taxa of 16 genera, of which Alternaria alternata, Colletotrichum dematium, and Stagonosporopsis sp. 2 are the most frequent colonizers. The extracts of 29 endophytic fungi displayed activities against important phytopathogenic fungi. Eight antifungal extracts were selected for chemical analysis. Forty fatty acids were identified by gas chromatography-flame-ionization detection (GC-FID) analysis. The compounds (-)-5-methylmellein and (-)(3R)-8-hydroxy-6-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-3,4-dihydroisocoumarin were isolated from Biscogniauxia mediterranea EPU38CA crude extract. (-)-5-Methylmellein showed weak activity against Phomopsis obscurans, P. viticola, and Fusarium oxysporum, and caused growth stimulation of C. fragariae, C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and Botrytis cinerea. (-)-(3R)-8-Hydroxy-6-methoxy-3,5-dimethyl-3,4-dihydroisocoumarin appeared slightly more active in the microtiter environment than 5-methylmellein. Our results indicate that E. purpurea lives symbiotically with different endophytic fungi, which are able to produce bioactive fatty acids and aromatic compounds active against important phytopathogenic fungi. The detection of the different fatty acids and aromatic compounds produced by the endophytic community associated with wild E. purpurea suggests that it may have intrinsic mutualistic resistance against phytopathogen attacks in its natural environment.",NA,culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Parthenium is a very aggressive and fast-spreading weed in Pakistan. The endophytes of Parthenium made it superior over other weeds. Those endophytes can be isolated, identified, and incorporated in sustainable agriculture to biologically control other severe weeds. Main body The present study was conducted to isolate and identify the endophytic fungi from the roots of Parthenium hysterophorus (Family: Asteraceae) and evaluate their cultural filtrate against the growth of three selected weed species, i.e., Chenopodium album, Avena fatua, and Convolvulus arvensis. Moreover, pot experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of cultural filtrates of these endophytic fungi against the germination, growth, and other physiological parameters (cellular contents, respiration, and cellular leakage) of the abovementioned three weed species. Three endophytic fungi, i.e., Alternaria, Aspergillus, and Drechslera spp., were isolated from the roots of P. hysterophorus. Among these endophytic fungi, cultural (hyphal) filtrate of Alternaria spp. exhibited the strongest phytotoxic effect, followed by Drechslera spp. and Aspergillus spp. against the selected weeds. Moreover, all the three endophytic fungi showed significant reduction in the germination as well as other physiological parameters of the weed species.

Phenotype MicroArray (PM) techniques provide a semi-high throughput assay for characterization and monitoring the microbial cellular phenotypes. Here, we present detailed descriptions of two different PM protocols used in our recent studies on fungal endophytes of forest trees, and highlight the benefits and limitations of this technique. We found that the PM approach enables effective screening of substrate utilization by endophytes. However, the technical limitations are multifaceted and the interpretation of the PM data challenging. For the best result, we recommend that the growth conditions for the fungi are carefully standardized. In addition, rigorous replication and control strategies should be employed whether using pre-configured, commercial microwell-plates or in-house designed PM plates for targeted substrate analyses. With these precautions, the PM technique is a valuable tool to characterize the metabolic capabilities of individual endophyte isolates, or successional endophyte communities identified by NGS, allowing a functional interpretation of the taxonomic data. Thus, PM approaches can provide valuable complementary information for NGS studies of fungal endophytes in forest trees.",NA,molecular; culture_based; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

(saffron) is a scarce plant that has been used as food flavoring agent, coloring agent, and traditional herbal medicine. Methods: The bioactivity of exopolysaccharide (EPS) extracted from an endophytic fungus of C. sativus was examined for the first time by antioxidative, antitumor, and antibacterial assays. The extraction conditions for EPS were optimized by combining the response surface methodology with Box-Behnken design. Results: EPS exhibited excellent scavenging activities against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl, hydroxyl and superoxide anion radicals, and moderate cytotoxicities against K562, A549, HL-60, and HeLa cells. The optimum extraction conditions for EPS were as follows: precipitation time of 16 h, precipitation temperature of 3.7 degrees C, pH 7.2, and ratio of ethanol to fermented broth of 5: 1 (L/L). Under the optimized conditions, the yield of EPS reached 162 +/- 6 mu g/L which was close to the predicted one (165 mu g/L). Moreover, high-performance liquid chromatography of monosaccharide composition showed that EPS comprised mannose, glucose, galactose xylose, and arabinose in a molar ratio of 25.6: 16.5: 1.0: 3.8: 5.4.

However, a seasonal succession of endophytes and the association with active ingredients is still unclear. In this study, we used high-throughput sequencing methods to compare the endophyte diversity of Rheum palmatum under different seasons and analyze the association between endophytes and five active ingredients. The results show that the diversity of endophytic fungi increased and then decreased, while bacterial diversity increased with the change of season. Community composition showed that the dominant genera of endophytic fungi were different under the different seasons, while the dominant genera of endophytic bacteria were Delftia. Analysis of co-occurrence network maps showed that the connectivity and complexity of endophytic fungi and bacterial networks decreased with the change of season. Spearman analysis indicated that the active ingredients of R. palmatum were significantly positive correlation with genera of endophytic fungi (Chalara).

This study was conducted to isolate L-asparaginase-producing endophytic fungi from medicinal plants of family Asteraceae. Seven healthy medicinal plants from family Asteraceae were selected for the isolation of endophytic fungi using standard surface sterilization techniques. A total of 837 isolates belonging to 84 species were comprised of the stem (55.6%), leaf (31.1%), root (10.6%) and flower (2.7%). Initial screening of L-asparaginase-producing endophytes was performed by qualitative plate assay on modified Czapex dox's agar medium. L-asparaginase activity of fungal endophytes was quantified by the nesslerization method. Identification of endophytic fungi was performed using both morphological characteristics and phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data including ribosomal DNA regions of ITS (Internal transcribed spacer) and LSU (partial large subunit rDNA), TEF1 (Translation Elongation Factor) and TUB (beta-tubulin). Of the 84 isolates, 38 were able to produce L-asparaginase and their L-asparaginase activities were between 0.019 and 0.492 unit/mL with Fusarium proliferatum being the most potent. L-asparaginase-producing endophytes were identified as species of Plectosphaerella, Fusarium, Stemphylium, Septoria, Alternaria, Didymella, Phoma, Chaetosphaeronema, Sarocladium, Nemania, Epicoccum, Ulocladium and Cladosporium.

The present project was undertaken to get fungi from indigenous sources might have higher enzyme activities as well as non-phytopathogenic for fast degradation of organic wastes for the purpose of soil health improvement and reduction of fertilizers load for crop production as safe food approach. Methods Accordingly, eight organic wastes were used for fungal species isolation and evaluated it in production of extracellular enzymes activities (amylase, cellulase, lipase and protease) and three crops seeds (mustard, mung bean and barley) germination. Results Thirty-nine distinct fungal isolates were tested against extracellular enzymes activities and the isolates of 2(1), 2(4), 2(6), 3(1), 3(7), 4(1), 4(2), 4(4) and 6(5) exhibited remarkable positive response to amylase, cellulase, lipase and protease enzymes activities. Subsequently, five fungal isolates [2(4): Trichoderma sp., 2(6): Trichoderma sp., 3(7): Aspergillus sp., 4(4): Trichoderma sp., and 6(5): Penicillium sp.] were selected based on superior performance in enzyme activities and used for seeds germination. Applied fungal suspension significantly (P <= 0.05) increased percent germination, radicle and plumule length but in most of the cases those values were insignificant to the results obtained in control treatment (tap water). The germination indices were higher at the treatments of 2(6), 3(7) and 6(5) isolates to mustard, mung bean and barley, respectively but closer to control treatment. Moreover, none of the applied fungi induced any pathogenic symptoms to any seeds.

This study developed techniques to visualize early infection of kauri by PTA in deliberately inoculated seedlings. Conventional light microscopy was carried out on cleared and stained roots using trypan blue to observe PTA structures. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the PTA root structures at a higher resolution. A fluorescent in situ hybridization assay (FISH) was developed using a PTA-specific probe to label PTA structures in planta. Infection progression in roots of 2-year-old kauri inoculated with PTA at 5, 10, 16 and 20 days post-inoculation (d.p.i.) was compared using these three approaches. Light microscopy identified no Phytophthora-like structures in the control treatments. In PTA-inoculated plants, lignitubers were produced 5 d.p.i. in cortical cells. Infection was localized after 5 days, but as the infection progressed (up to 20 d.p.i.), the 'degree' of root infection increased, as did the number of replicates in which structures were observed. SEM provided higher resolution images; again, no PTA structures were observed in the negative control material examined. The slide-based FISH-specificity assay successfully hybridized with PTA hyphae. Fluorescence was observed using 330-380 nm excitation and an emission filter at 420 nm (DAPI), with PTA nuclei fluorescing a bright greenish-yellow. Cross-reactivity was not observed when the assay was applied to six other non-target Phytophthora species. Successful hybridization reactions occurred between the primer and PTA structures in planta. Applying this FISH assay has allowed clear differentiation of the intracellular and intercellular structures of PTA. The technique can be applied to longer term studies or analysis of ex situ inoculation studies aiming to elucidate differential host-responses to the pathogen. Additionally, the technique could be applied to study the interactions with other fungal endophytes (e.g. mycorrhizal fungi), which could be assessed for biocontrol potential as part of the integrated management of the disease.",root; mycorrhizal,molecular; microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; surface_sterilization,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, it remains unclear whether this assembly is pathogen-specific and how regulatory pathways are coordinated in multi-pathogens. In order to investigate the effects of infection with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Cg treatment) and Fusarium proliferatum (Fp treatment) on walnut leaf endophytic microbiome in their assembly, co-occurrence pattern, and on comprehensive chemical function of the internal environment of leaf, an interaction system of the walnut-pathogenic fungi was constructed using seed embryo tissue culture technology. The study showed differences in the assembly of endophytic microbial communities in walnut trees across three groups (control group, Ck; Cg; Fp) after Cg and Fp treatments. Despite changes in relative abundances, the dominant communities in phyla and genera remained comparable during the infection of the two pathogens. Endophyte fungi were more sensitive to the pathogen challenge than endophyte bacteria. Both promoted the enrichment of beneficial bacteria such as Bacillus and Pseudomonas, changed the modularity of the community, and reduced the stability and complexity of the endophyte community. Pathogenic fungi infection mainly affects the metabolism of porphyrin and chlorophyll, purine metabolism, phenylpropane metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. However, there was no significant difference in the secondary metabolites for the different susceptible plants. By screening endogenous antagonistic bacteria, we further verified that Pseudomonas psychrotolerans and Bacillus subtilis had inhibitory effects on the two pathogenic fungi and participated in the interaction between the leaves and pathogenic fungi.

The metabolic shaping of endophytes on grape cells was reported previously. However, there are no reports on the interactions and metabolic impact of endophyte symbiosis onin vitrovine leaves, which may be examined under well-controlled conditions that are more representative of the natural situation of endophytes within grapevines. The present study used anin vitroleaf method to establish endophyte symbiosis of grapevines and analyze the effects on the metabolic profiles of grape leaves from two different cultivars, 'Rose honey' (RH) and 'Cabernet sauvignon' (CS). The effects of endophytic fungi on the metabolic profiles of grape leaves exhibited host selectivity and fungal strain specificity. Most of the endophytic fungal strains introduced novel metabolites into the two varieties of grape leaves according to the contents of the detected metabolites and composition of metabolites. Strains RH49 and MDR36, with high or moderate symbiosis rates, triggered an increased response in terms of the detected metabolites, and the strains MDR1 and MDR33 suppressed the detected metabolites in CS and RH leaves despite having strong or moderate symbiosis ability. However, the strain RH12 significantly induced the production of novel metabolites in RH leaves due to its high symbiosis ability and suppression of metabolites in CS leaves.",leaf,plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

We used a culture-based approach coupled with phylogenetic analyses to characterize the incidence, diversity and composition of fungal endophyte assemblages in ferns, with a focus on healthy aboveground tissues of seven species of eupolypods at La Selva, Costa Rica. Endophytes were isolated from every individual plant and were similarly abundant and diverse in frond blades and stalks, in different vegetation types, in epiphytic vs. terrestrial species, and between sampling years. However, abundance, diversity and community structure differed significantly among fern species, and composition differed markedly between sampling years. Phylogenetic classification using separate and combined datasets revealed that as for many Neotropical angiosperms, the majority (95%) of endophyte taxa were Ascomycota, with particular dominance by Sordariomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and Dothideomycetes. However, our data suggest higher phylogenetic richness and stronger host affinities in fern associated endophytes relative to those studied in angiosperms thus far.",blade; ground tissue; ground tissues,molecular; culture_based; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, the endophytes associated with Dysosma difformis-an ethnomedicinal plant species were isolated to explore novel sources of podophyllotoxin. Fifty-three endophytic fungi were isolated and identified by morphological observation and ITS-based rDNA sequencing, assigning them to 27 genera in 3 divisions. Fusarium was found the most prevalent genus with a colonization frequency of 11.11%, followed by Trametes (9.26%) and Penicillium (7.41%). Phylogenetic trees were constructed for the endophytic fungi community in two collection sites, Ha Giang and Lai Chau, revealing the adaptation of the species to the specific tissues and habitats. Cytotoxic activity of endophytic fungal extracts was investigated on cancer cell lines such as SK-LU-1, HL-60, and HepG2, demonstrating strong anti-cancer activity of six isolates belonging to Penicillium, Trametes, Purpureocillium, Aspergillus, and Ganoderma with IC50 value of lower than 10 mu g/mL. The presence of podophyllotoxin was indicated in Penicillium, Trametes, Aspergillus and for the first time in Purpureocillium and Ganoderma via high-performance liquid chromatography, which implied them as a potential source of this anti-cancer compound.",NA,molecular; culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, we determined the biomass production and growth parameters endophyte infected (E+) and endophyte uninfected (E-) Elymus dahuricus plants under high water (HW) and low water (LW) treatment for 8 weeks in a controlled-environment condition experiment. We also determined the changes in the activities of the anti-oxidative enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and content of H2O2, as well as levels of proline and chlorophyll a + b were examined in the leaves of E+ and E- plants. Under low water treatment, E+ plants produced more biomass and had higher values in plant height and tiller numbers, but no influence by the fungus were observed in high water treatment. Anti-oxidative enzyme (include SOD, POD, CAT and APX) activities and contents of proline and chlorophyll a + b increased and H2O2 concentration declined in the E+ plants compared with E- plants under low water treatment. Therefore, endophyte infection was a benefit to growth and anti-oxidative affection E. dahuricus under low water treatment.",pod; leaf,physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many studies indicated that nanoparticles can boost the production of secondary metabolites. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of eco-friendly silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on the growth and productivity of Peucedanum praeruptorum Dunn. Initially, the AgNPs were synthesized by an endophytic fungus Diaporthe zaofenghuang from P. praeruptorum and their physicochemical attributes were identified, including their spherical shape, size ranging from 40 to 80 nm in diameter, and the presence of reducing-capping groups such as hydroxyl, carbonyl and phenolic. Following this, six-week-old P. praeruptorum seedlings were sprayed with AgNPs at 0, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mg L-1 for 50 days. Compared with untreated and higher dose AgNPs-treated seedlings, the application of 12.5 mg L-1 AgNPs significantly improved plant performance (chlorophyll contents, root/shoot length, and the fresh/dry weights), and increased antioxidant enzyme activities and accumulation of nonenzymatic antioxidants (total phenols, flavonoids, and praeruptorin A and B). Further, metabolomic analysis unveiled that the AgNPs induced metabolic reprogramming in P. praeruptorum . Among these changes, tyrosine exhibited a significant down-regulation, likely influencing the synthesis of imperatorin which has been shown to be an important coumarin marker in P. praeruptorum . The findings suggest the usefulness of AgNPs in the breeding of P. praeruptorum can regulate the production of bioactive compounds, which can enhance the medicinal quality of crude drugs derived from P. praeruptorum .",root; shoot,physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Epichloe-infected grass varieties are commonly used in areas with high pest pressure due to their better performances compared to endophyte-free varieties. The insect resistance of Epichloe-infected grasses has been associated with four main groups of endophyte secondary metabolites: ergot alkaloids, indole-diterpenes, lolines and peramine. Concentrations of these alkaloids are usually measured with high performance liquid chromatography or gas chromatography analysis, which are accurate methods but relatively expensive and laborious. In this paper, we developed a rapid method based on NIRS to detect and quantify loline alkaloids in wild accessions of Schedonorus pratensis infected with the fungal endophyte Epichloe uncinata. The quantitative NIR equations obtained by modified partial least squares algorithm had coefficients of correlation of 0.90, 0.78, 0.85, 0.90 for N-acetylloline, N-acetylnorloline and N-formylloline and the sum of the three, respectively. The acquired NIR spectra were also used for developing an equation to predict in planta fungal biomass with a coefficient of correlation of 0.75. These results showed that the use of NIRS and chemometrics allows the quantification of loline alkaloids and mycelial biomass in a heterogeneous set of endophyte-infected meadow fescue samples.",NA,physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Fungal symbionts can mediate plant drought response by enhancing drought tolerance and avoidance, but these effects have not been quantified across grass species. We performed a factorial meta-analysis of previously published studies to determine how arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and endophytic fungal symbionts affect growth of grasses under drought. We then examined how the effect of fungal symbionts on plant growth was influenced by biotic (plant photosynthetic pathway) and abiotic (level of drought) factors. We also measured the phylogenetic signal of fungal symbionts on grass growth under control and drought conditions. Under drought conditions, grasses colonized by AM fungi grew larger than those without mycorrhizal symbionts. The increased growth of grasses conferred from fungal symbionts was greatest at the lowest soil moisture levels. Furthermore, under both drought and control conditions, C3 grasses colonized by AM fungi grew larger than C3 grasses without symbionts, but the biomass of C4 grasses was not affected by AM fungi. Endophytes did not increase plant biomass overall under any treatment. However, there was a phylogenetically conserved increase in plant biomass in grasses colonized by endophytes. Grasses and their fungal symbionts seem to interact within a context-dependent symbiosis, varying with biotic and abiotic conditions. Because plant-fungal symbioses significantly alter plant drought response, including these responses could improve our ability to predict grassland functioning under global change.",mycorrhizal,molecular; culture_based; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

The litter decomposition ratio was closely correlated with lignin degradation. The soil phenol concentration increased with the acceleration of litter decomposition after the first 30 days and later decreased to below the initial level. Based on denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis, soil bacteria, especially gram-negative bacteria that have the potential to degrade aromatic compounds, were found in high abundance when the soil phenol concentration was high. When the phenolic concentration decreased, soil fungi increased in abundance. With fungal application, seed germination significantly increased to 69.87% and seedling growth was enhanced. Rapid litter decomposition by Pho. liquidambari initially led to higher releases of phenolic allelochemicals, which led to the enrichment of soil gram-negative bacteria. In addition, increased soil nutrients and temporarily higher concentrations of phenolics from litter decomposition strengthen seedling growth, suggesting that the endophytic fungus Pho. liquidambari is a suitable candidate for remediation of long-term cropping soil.

However, little is known about the effect of S. sapinea on the structure of endophytic fungal communities in needles of P. densiflora. In this study, the diversity and structure of the endophytic fungal communities associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic needles of P. densiflora were investigated. Needles of P. densiflora were sampled from mixed coniferous forests, and high through-put sequencing was used to determine the diversity and community structure of endophytic fungi. The results demonstrated that endophytic fungal abundance increased when the lesion length was longer, and the endophytic fungal diversity showed an upward trend as the infection of S. sapinea worsened. The dominant genera of endophytic fungi in asymptomatic needles of P. densiflora in mixed coniferous forest was Paraconiothyrium and Selenophoma. Cenangium is considered to have a certain association with S. sapinea infection in the endophytic fungal community.

Quantitative PCR results showed that fungi and bacteria were ubiquitous and variable among different host plants. Scaevola sericea showed the lowest absolute abundance and highest diversity of fungi and bacteria, while Cocos nucifera had the lowest abundance and the highest diversity of diazotrophs compare to the other four plants. There was a small proportion of shared microorganisms among the five different plants, while unique fungi, bacteria and diazotrophs were significantly enriched for different host plant species in this study (p < 0.05).

Changes in fungal communities were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing (HTS), and decay and fruit quality were monitored during storage. The results showed that HA treatment effectively maintains fruit quality and the richness and diversity of fungal communities. Heat treatment inhibited decay development and reduced the growth of fungi in the genera Botryotinia spp., Davidiella spp., Hanseniaspora spp., and Candida spp. Canonical correspondence analysis further revealed that Botryotinia spp. and Davidiella spp. were positively correlated with fruit decay and weight loss. FUNGuild analysis demonstrated that HA-treated bayberries had a lower relative abundance within the plant pathogen guild, but higher relative abundance within the endophyte guild.

In this study, the effects of single- and co-inoculation of Lactuca serriola with an arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus, Rhizoglomus intraradices, and endophytic fungi, Mucor sp. or Trichoderma asperellum, on plant growth, vitality, toxic metal accumulation, sesquiterpene lactone production and flavonoid concentration in the presence of toxic metals were evaluated. Inoculation with the AM fungus increased biomass yield of the plants grown on non-polluted and polluted substrate. Co-inoculation with the AM fungus and Mucor sp. resulted in increased biomass yield of plants cultivated on the polluted substrate, whereas co-inoculation with T. asperellum and the AM fungus increased plant biomass on the non-polluted substrate. In the presence of Mucor sp., mycorrhizal colonization and arbuscule richness were increased in the non-polluted substrate. Co-inoculation with the AM fungus and Mucor sp. increased Zn concentration in leaves and roots. The concentration of sesquiterpene lactones in plant leaves was decreased by AM fungus inoculation in both substrates. Despite enhanced host plant costs caused by maintaining symbiosis with numerous microorganisms, interaction of wild lettuce with both mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi was more beneficial than that with a single fungus.

The UNR (teleomorph Ceratobasidium bicorne) causes root dieback in conifer seedlings following invasion of the vascular cylinder via root apex and destroying apical meristems whilst the BNR, representing anastomosis group AG-I of genus Ceratobasidium, is primarily restricted to the cortex in basal root regions. In the experiment 1 the fungi were simultaneously inoculated on roots, while in experiment 2, BNR was pre-inoculated 168 h before inoculation with UNR. Nucleic acids were extracted from infected roots at intervals up to 192 h post-infection (hpi), and the genomic DNA levels of the host and fungi and the transcript levels of a house-keeping gene (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and nine putative defence genes were quantified. In simultaneous inoculation UNR was more competitive than BNR whereas pre-inoculation of BNR suppressed but did not completely prevent root colonization by UNR. Stilbene synthase (STS) transcription was significantly up-regulated in single-inoculations with both fungi and in dual inoculation in both experiments. Maximum STS transcript levels were observed in roots single-inoculated with UNR; the peak level at 48 hpi in experiment 2 was significantly higher than in seedlings single-inoculated with BNR or co-inoculated with both fungi, the latter two treatments showing relatively similar STS transcript levels. Similarly, transcript levels of phenylalanine ammonia lyase at 48 hpi in experiment 2 were significantly higher in roots single-inoculated with UNR compared with BNR or in UNR+BNR co-inoculations. The other seven putative defence genes monitored did not show any clear-cut up-regulation following fungal inoculation. We conclude that BNR suppresses UNR in Scots pine roots via direct competition for infection sites, since the studied transcripts showed no evidence of BNR induced resistance against UNR. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",root; meristem; cortex,microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

A screening of fungal isolates for biologically active secondary metabolites (antibacterial, antifungal, herbicidal) showed that the proportion of endophytic isolates that produced herbicidally active substances was three times that of the soil isolates and twice that of the phytopathogenic fungi. As markers for the plant defence reaction, the concentrations of certain phenolic metabolites were chosen. Those that differed in concentration were higher in the roots of plants infected with an endophyte than in those infected with a pathogen. The results presented here were regarded together with previous studies on other aspects of the plant defence response using dual cultures of plant host calli and endophytes, and of cell suspension cultures following endophytic as compared to pathogenic: elicitation. The following hypothesis was developed I both the pathogen-host and the endophyte-host interactions involve constant mutual antagonisms at least in part based on the secondary metabolites the partners produce.

The composition and structure of endophytes vary in different plant tissues, which are specific habitats for endophyte colonization. To analyze the diversity and structural composition of endophytic fungi from toothed clubmoss (Huperzia serrata) that was artificially cultivated for 3 years, we investigated endophytic fungi from the roots, stems and leaves using comparative sequence analysis of the ITS2 region of the fungal rRNA genes sequenced with high-throughput sequencing technology. Seven fungal phyla were identified, and fungal diversity and structure varied across different tissues, with the most distinctive community features found in the roots. A total of 555 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected, and 198 were common to all samples, and 43, 16, 16 OTUs were unique to the root, stem, leaf samples, respectively. Taxonomic classification showed that Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were dominant phyla, and Cladosporium, Oidiodendron, Phyllosticta, Sebacina and Ilyonectria were dominant genera. The relative abundance heat map at the genus level suggested that H. serrata had characteristic endophytic fungal microbiomes. Line discriminant analysis effect size analysis and principal coordinate analysis demonstrated that fungal communities were tissue-type and tissue-site specific.

To enhance plant productivity and health, and to translate lab- and greenhouse-based phytobiome research to field applications, the academic community and end-users need to address a variety of scientific, practical, and social challenges. Prior discussion of phytobiomes has focused heavily on plant-associated bacterial and fungal assemblages, but the phytobiomes concept covers all factors that influence plant function. Here we discuss various management considerations, including abiotic conditions (e.g., soil and nutrient applications), microorganisms (e.g., bacterial and fungal assemblages, bacterial and fungal inoculants, and viruses), macroorganisms (e.g., arthropods and plant genetics), and societal factors (e.g., communication approaches and technology diffusion). An important near-term goal for this field should be to estimate the potential relative contribution of different components of the phytobiome to plant health, as well as the potential and risk of modifying each in the near future.",NA,inoculation,NA,NA,NA,NA

Recognition of the deleterious effects of the endophytic fungus Acremonium coenophialum has resulted in substantial acceptance of new endophyte‐free cultivars. Destruction of old pastures and the concomitant loss of potentially valuable adapted germplasm could be a valid cause for concern. The objectives of this study were to evaluate genetic variation for maturity and plant morphological traits, both among and within tall fescue cv. ‘Kentucky 31’ populations from 18 to 38 year‐old pastures in Alabama. Ten populations of approximately 50 plants each were collected from old Alabama tall fescue pastures. Two pastures were sampled in each of five counties, representing the five major land use areas of the state. In 1990, spaced plants of all populations were evaluated at heading time for maturity, morphological, and disease traits at two locations in central Alabama. Endophyte infection level of the populations ranged from 2 to 100 %. Maturity was highly correlated with tiller length and flag leaf width and was used as a covariate for these traits in the analysis of variance. Leaf rust and net blotch ratings were negatively correlated. Significant variation among populations was observed for maturity and flag leaf dimensions, most variation being due to differences among source counties. Significant variation was observed within all populations for maturity and morphological traits, but only in seven populations for leaf rust. No within‐population variation was detected for net blotch. The average precipitation for the month of May explained 81 % of the variation among populations for maturity. Age of the pasture sampled had a significant effect on tiller diameter (r2= 0.55), and latitude of the pasture sampled was the best individual predictor of leaf width (r2= 0.42).

Remarkably, Rhizopus oryzae at a concentration of 5 mg/mL efficiently restricted the growth of ATCC strain of E. coli in comparison with positive control ciprofloxacin. Rhizopus oryzae and F. fujikuroi at a concentration of 1000 mu g/ml exhibited maximum antioxidant activity of 45% and 44%, respectively. They also showed antifungal activity ranging from 60 to 75% against Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. Our analysis of the fungal extracts through GC-MS indicated the presence of 21 compounds of diverse nature and structure. In conclusion, our study highlighted the potential of D. salicifolia to host a plethora of fungal endophytes that secrete potentially therapeutic bioactive metabolites",NA,molecular; culture_based; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

The full mass spectra can be analysed by multivariate statistics to determine discriminating ions, and the fragmentation data allows rapid classification or identification of these ions. The methodology was used to screen a wide range of strains of endophytic fungi in perennial ryegrass seeds for differences in metabolic profiles. The results show that this newly developed methodology is able to determine discriminating ions that can be present in very low concentrations. It also yielded sufficient fragmentation data to classify or identify the discriminating ions. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",seed,culture_based; surface_sterilization,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, current knowledge regarding the successive changes in fungal communities during litter decomposition is limited. Here we explored the development of the fungal community over 24 months of litter decomposition in a temperate forest with dominant Quercus petraea using 454-pyrosequencing of the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and cellobiohydrolase I (cbhI) genes, which encode exocellulases, to specifically address cellulose decomposers. To quantify the involvement of phyllosphere fungi in litter decomposition, the fungal communities in live leaves and leaves immediately before abscission were also analysed. The results showed rapid succession of fungi with dramatic changes in the composition of the fungal community. Furthermore, most of the abundant taxa only temporarily dominated in the substrate. Fungal diversity was lowest at leaf senescence, increased until month 4 and did not significantly change during subsequent decomposition. Highly diverse community of phyllosphere fungi inhabits live oak leaves 2 months before abscission, and these phyllosphere taxa comprise a significant share of the fungal community during early decomposition up to the fourth month. Sequences assigned to the Ascomycota showed highest relative abundances in live leaves and during the early stages of decomposition. In contrast, the relative abundance of sequences assigned to the Basidiomycota phylum, particularly basidiomycetous yeasts, increased with time. Although cellulose was available in the litter during all stages of decomposition, the community of cellulolytic fungi changed substantially over time. The results indicate that litter decomposition is a highly complex process mediated by various fungal taxa.

They were allowed to grow to sixth instar when survivors were collected. First, by using 3-yr old trees, a comparison was made of budworm growth on infected and uninfected trees. A second experiment used 4-yr old trees to study the effect of rugulosin content in the needle on growth. This permitted an examination of a dose response in relation to growth, and allowed us to eliminate the potential for differences in environment or foliar chemistry affecting the results. At sixth instar, budworms feeding on infected trees that contained rugulosin were smaller than those on uninfected trees. At needle concentrations above the dietary low observed effect level of rugulosin for C. fumerana > 0.5 mu g g(-1), a dose response was seen. For the first time, this demonstrates an inverse effect in outdoor nursery experiments between budworm weight and rugulosin concentration.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods and Results Thirty-seven endophytic bacteria were isolated from peanut seeds, six of which exhibited stronger antagonistic activities against S. rolfsii (inhibition rate, IR of hyphae growth >= 70%). Strain LHSB1, the strongest antagonistic strain, was identified as Bacillus velezensis. LHSB1 showed 93 center dot 8% of radial growth inhibition of S. rolfsii hyphae and exhibited obvious antagonistic activity against another six pathogenic fungi of peanut. Pot experiments showed two different LHSB1 treatments both significantly reduced the disease incidence and severity of stem rot (P < 0 center dot 05) compared to the controls, and the biocontrol efficacy reached 62 center dot 6-70 center dot 8%, significantly higher than that of Carbendazim control (P < 0 center dot 05). Further analyses revealed LHSB1 culture filtrate significantly inhibited sclerotia formation and germination, caused the abnormalities and membrane integrity damage of S. rolfsii hyphae, which might be the possible mode of action of LHSB1 against S. rolfsii. Three antifungal lipopeptides bacillomycin A, surfactin A and fengycin A, were detected in LHSB1 culture extracts by UPLC-ESI-MS, which could be responsible for the biocontrol activity of LHSB1 against S. rolfsii. Conclusion Our results suggested that the seed-borne endophytic B. velezensis LHSB1 would be a tremendous potential agent for the biocontrol of peanut stem rot caused by S. rolfsii. Significance and Impact of the Study This comprehensive study provides a candidate endophytic biocontrol strain and reveals its antifungal mechanism against S. rolfsi. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that seed-borne endophytic B. velezensis was used as the biocontrol agent to control peanut stem rot.",seed; stem,culture_based; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Using the ""Tissue Planting"" method, 19 endophytic fungi were isolated from the leaves and stem of those plants and subsequently identified through morphological characteristics and molecular approaches. From all plants employed in this investigation, Aspergillus flavus, A. niger (Type I), A. niger (Type II), A. terreus, Colletotrichum sp., Penicillium sp.1, Pestalotiopsis mangiferae, and white sterile mycelium were isolated. To delve deeper, ten of these isolates underwent characterization via internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region amplification, and the sequence results obtained utilizing the ITS1 and ITS4 primers were cross-referenced with NCBI GenBank database system through BLAST analysis. The phylogenetic tree generated by the UPGMA method grouped the endophytic fungi into different clades on the basis of genetic distances. Cladosporium xanthochromaticum, Colletotrichum siamense, Fusarium incarnatum, and Talaromyces pinophilus have been recorded for the first time from Bangladesh.

The purpose of this study was to characterize sporidial (T) and mycelial (M-T) strains of U. esculenta isolated from sporulating and non-sporulating galls on plants growing in Zhejiang province, China. Morphological comparisons of the T strain and M-T strain were made by optical and scanning electron microscope observation. Genetic differences were examined by sequencing the ITS region of the fungus and examining differential protein expression by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF-MS/MS. The sporidial (T) and mycelial (M-T) strains differed in morphological characteristics of their in vitro single colony formations and in cell shape. Alignment of ITS sequences of the T strain and M-T strain revealed a single mutation between the T strain and M-T strain, but the sequences were the same within strains. A total of 146 proteins were only expressed in the M-T strain, and 242 proteins were only expressed in the T strain isolated from infected plants. A total of 222 proteins were up-regulated or down-regulated in the T strain when compared with the M-T strain. Of these, 18 proteins were identified and eight were associated with processes involving energy metabolism and the cytoskeleton. Two morphology-related proteins, MAP kinase kinase and actin, were differentially expressed. The differences noted in the T strain and M-T strain may lead to a better understanding of the life cycle and morphogenesis in U. esculenta.",gall,molecular; culture_based; microscopy,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hence, knowledge of mycorrhizal fungi associated with orchids inhabiting different ecosystems is essential to designing recovery strategies for threatened species. This study analyzes the mycorrhizal associations of terrestrial orchids colonizing grassland and understory in native ecosystems of the region of La Araucania in southern Chile. Mycorrhizal fungi were isolated from peloton-containing roots and identified based on the sequence of the ITS region. Their capacities for seed germination were also investigated. We detectedTulasnellaspp. andCeratobasidiumspp. in the pelotons of the analyzed orchids. Additionally, we showed that someCeratobasidiumisolates effectively induce seed germination to differing degrees, unlikeTulasnellaspp., which, in most cases, fail to achieve protocorm growth. This process may underline a critical step in the life cycle ofTulasnella-associated orchids, whereas theCeratobasidium-associated orchids were less specific for fungi and were effectively germinated with mycorrhizal fungi isolated from adult roots.",mycorrhizal; root; seed,molecular; culture_based; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

While ordination of the DGGE data suggested that the assemblages did not differ significantly between the two plant taxa, T-RFLP data provided marginal statistical support for the presence of different assemblages. Fungi isolated from roots of both plants were identified by ITS sequence comparisons largely as ascomycetes, several of which had close sequence identity to Helotiales ericoid mycorrhizal (ERM) fungi. One isolate morphotype from E. pulchella had close sequence similarity to ectomycorrhizal fungi in the Cenococcum geophilum complex, and neighbour-joining analysis grouped this strongly with other Australian C. geophilum-like sequences. Distribution of genotypes of an ERM Helotiales ascomycete in root systems of the two plant taxa was also investigated using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR)-PCR. Nineteen ISSR genotypes were identified, two of which were present in roots of both plant taxa.

However, current understanding of host responses upon Xf-infection is limited to allow early disease prediction, diagnosis, and sustainable strategies for breeding on plant tolerance. Recently, we identified a major complex trait for early de novo programming, named CoV-MAC-TED, by comparing early transcriptome data during plant cell survival with SARS-CoV-2-infected human cells. This trait linked ROS/RNS balancing during first hours of stress perception with increased aerobic fermentation connected to alpha-tubulin-based cell restructuration and control of cell cycle progression. Furthermore, our group had advanced concepts and strategies for breeding on plant holobionts. Here, we studied tolerance against Xf-infection by applying a CoV-MAC-TED-related gene set to (1) progress proof-of-principles, (2) highlight the importance of individual host responses for knowledge gain, (3) benefit sustainable production of Xf-threatened olive, (4) stimulate new thinking on principle roles of secondary metabolite synthesis and microbiota for system equilibration and, (5) advance functional marker development for resilience prediction including tolerance to Xf-infections. We performed hypothesis-driven complex analyses in an open access transcriptome of primary target xylem tissues of naturally Xf-infected olive trees of the Xf-tolerant cv. Leccino and the Xf-susceptible cv. Ogliarola. The results indicated that cyanide-mediated equilibration of oxygen-dependent respiration and carbon-stress alleviation by the help of increased glycolysis-driven aerobic fermentation paths and phenolic metabolism associate to tolerance against Xf. Furthermore, enhanced alternative oxidase (AOX) transcript levels through transcription Gleichschaltung linked to quinic acid synthesis appeared as promising trait for functional marker development. Moreover, the results support the idea that fungal endophytes strengthen Xf-susceptible genotypes, which lack efficient AOX functionality. Overall, this proof-of-principles approach supports the idea that efficient regulation of the multi-functional AOX gene family can assist selection on multiple-resilience, which integrates Xf-tolerance, and stimulates future validation across diverse systems.",xylem,molecular; culture_based; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

The mycobiome of this non-mycorhizal plant and its capacity to adapt to TM-contaminated environments remains unknown. This study aimed at characterizing the mycobiome associated with nettle and poplar roots co-occurring at a TM-contaminated site. Plant root barcoding using the fungi-specific ITS1F-ITS2 primers and Illumina MiSeq technology revealed that nettle and poplar had distinct root fungal communities. The nettle mycobiome was dominated by Pezizomycetes from known endophytic taxa and from the supposedly saprotrophic genus Kotlabaea (which was the most abundant). Several ectomycorrhizal fungi such as Inocybe (Agaricomycetes) and Tuber (Pezizomycetes) species were associated with the poplar roots. Most of the Pezizomycetes taxa were present in the highly TM-contaminated area whereas Agaricomycetes tended to be reduced. Despite being a known non-mycorrhizal plant, nettle was associated with a significant proportion of ectomycorrhizal OTU (9.7%), suggesting some connexions between the poplar and the nettle root mycobiomes. Finally, our study raised the interest in reconsidering the fungal networking beyond known mycorrhizal interactions. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

Usually considered for their mechanical role, roots of bromeliads may also play a role in resource use that we expect to differ between ontogenetic stages, namely nutrient pulse-supplied atmospherics (young stage) and continuously-supplied tanks (later stage). On a selection of adventitious roots of the heteroblastic epiphyte Lutheria splendens, we explored 1) ontogenetic variations in morphological and anatomical root traits, namely the number of adventitious roots and tips, total root length, average root diameter, root tissue density, specific root length and root tissue areas, and 2) ontogenetic changes in the composition of the root-associated fungal communities using ITS1 region-based high-throughput sequencing. Plant size, taken as an indicator of gradual ontogenetic variations, and plant stage had significant effects on root traits, unless for root tissue density. The number of adventitious roots and tips, the total root length, average root diameter and all root tissue areas (i.e. velamen, outer cortex, inner cortex, vascular cylinder) increased gradually with ontogeny while the specific root length decreased abruptly. The root-associated fungal communities varied with plant stage. The tank stage showed higher proportion of mycorrhizal fungi and a lower abundance of dark septate endophyte as compared to atmospheric stage. Overall, we demonstrated significant ontogenetic variations of root traits and fungal partners in bromeliad species that suggest important changes in the strategy for resource use as plants mature. We invite future root trait studies to better account for ontogenetic variations.",leaf; root; adventitious root; cortex; mycorrhizal,molecular; culture_based; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

In an attempt to populate the Fungal Tree of Life, fresh samples of 10 obscure genera of hyphomycetes were collected. These fungi were subsequently established in culture, and subjected to DNA sequence analysis of the ITS and LSU nrRNA genes to resolve species and generic questions related to these obscure genera. Brycekendrickomyces (Herpotrichiellaceae) is introduced as a new genus similar to, but distinct from Haplographium and Lauriomyces. Chalastospora is shown to be a genus in the Pleosporales, with two new species, C. ellipsoidea and C. obclavata, to which Alternaria malorum is added as an additional taxon under its oldest epithet, C. gossypii. Cyphellophora eugeniae is newly described in Cyphellophora (Herpotrichiellaceae), and distinguished from other taxa in the genus. Dictyosporium is placed in the Pleosporates, with one new species, D. streliziae. The genus Edenia, which was recently introduced for a sterile endophytic fungus isolated in Mexico, is shown to be a hyphomycete (Pleosporales) forming a pyronellea-like synanamorph in culture. Thedgionia is shown not to represent an anamorph of Mycosphaerella, but to belong to the Helotiales. Trochophora, however, clustered basal to the Pseudocercospora complex in the Mycosphaerellaceae, as did Verrucisporota. Vonarxia, a rather forgotten genus of hyphomycetes, is shown to belong to the Herpotrichiellaceae and Xenostigmina is confirmed as synanamorph of Mycopappus, and is shown to be allied to Seifertia in the Pleosporales.

In our previous study, endophytic fungi were isolated from mango trees ( Mangifera indica L.). The present study examined fifty endophytic fungal isolates for mineral solubilization activity, ammonia production, and siderophore production. It was shown that these isolates could produce phytohormones indole-3-acetic acid and gibberellic acid, as well as inhibit plant pathogens, specifically Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Lasiodiplodia theobromae. . The results showed that all the isolated fungal endophytes exhibited various activities. Based on the findings, two fungal endophytes- Aureobasidium pullulans CY.OS 13 and Aspergillus tamarii CY.OS 144-were selected for dual inoculation in chili plants under pot-scale conditions to investigate their potential to improve growth-related traits such as seed germination, shoot and root length, biomass, and chlorophyll content. Seed treated with A. pullulans CY.OS 13 and/or A. tamarii CY.OS 144 showed a significant (p p < 0.05) increase in seed germination and growth parameters of chili plants grown under pot-scale conditions. Particularly, chili plants whose seeds were injected with a combination of the two selected endophytic fungi showed the highest plant development traits. Therefore, the selected endophytic fungi have the potential to be used as biofertilizers, especially when combined.

During the rootless phase in summer, colonies of bulbs were removed and replanted after the soil around and below the bulb had been mixed (major disturbance) so as to disrupt the external mycelium of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. As a minor disturbance treatment, top soil was removed, bulbs were turned or not in their growth position with as little other disturbance as possible, and the top soil replaced. Control plants were left undisturbed. Half of the plants were harvested 3-4 weeks after the onset of root emergence. Populations of all AM fungi in roots were greatly reduced by major disturbance, whilst those in other treatments and controls were unaffected. At the second harvest, in spring, when shoots had emerged, root colonisation by fine endophytes and Scutellospora morphotypes developed in all treatments, whereas that of Acaulospora morphotypes remained low after major disturbance. Disturbance treatments delayed the appearance, at the second harvest, of mycorrhizas with degenerate arbuscules. Leaf phosphorus concentration was unaffected by soil disturbance, possibly due to partial recovery of AM fungal populations or buffering by resources stored in the bulb.",root; mycorrhizal; bulb; shoot; leaf,culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction,NA,NA,NA,NA

This association is important both ecologically and to the pasture and turf industries, as the endophytic fungi confer a multitude of benefits to their host plant that improve competitive ability and performance such as growth promotion, abiotic stress tolerance, pest deterrence and increased host disease resistance. Biotic stress tolerance conferred by the production of bioprotective metabolites has a critical role in an industry context. While the known antimammalian and insecticidal toxins are well characterized due to their impact on livestock welfare, antimicrobial metabolites are less studied. Both pasture and turf grasses are challenged by many phytopathogenic diseases that result in significant economic losses and impact livestock health. Further investigations of Epichloe endophytes as natural biocontrol agents can be conducted on strains that are safe for animals. With the additional benefits of possessing host disease resistance, these strains would increase their commercial importance. Field reports have indicated that pasture grasses associated with Epichloe endophytes are superior in resisting fungal pathogens. However, only a few antifungal compounds have been identified and chemically characterized, and these from sexual (pathogenic) Epichloe species, rather than those utilized to enhance performance in turf and pasture industries.

The objectives of this study were to understand the causes for the emerging target spot epidemics in the United States by comparing phylogenetic relationships of isolates from cotton, tomato, soybean, and other crop plants and ornamental hosts, and through the determination of the host range of isolates from emerging populations. Fifty-three isolates were sampled from plants in the southeastern United States and 1,380 nucleotides from four nuclear loci were sequenced. Additionally, sequences of the same loci from 23 isolates representing each of the distinct lineages of C. cassiicola described from previous studies were included. Isolates clustered based on host of origin, regardless of the geographic location of sampling. There was no genetic diversity detected among isolates from cotton, which were genetically distinct from isolates from other host species. Furthermore, pathogenicity and virulence assays of 40 isolates from various hosts onto cotton, soybean, tomato, and cucumber showed that isolates from cotton were more aggressive to cotton than those from other hosts. Soybean and tomato were most susceptible to isolates that originated from the same host, providing evidence of host specialization. These results suggest that emerging target spot epidemics in the United States are caused by either the introduction of host-specific isolates or the evolution of more aggressive strains on each host.",NA,molecular; culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we report the pleiotropic effects of the epigenetic regulator HdaA (histone deacetylase) on secondary metabolite production and the associated biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) expression in the plant endophytic fungusPenicillium chrysogenumFes1701. Deletion of thehdaAgene in strain Fes1701 induced a significant change of the secondary metabolite profile with the emergence of the bioactive indole alkaloid meleagrin. Simultaneously, more meleagrin/roquefortine-related compounds and less chrysogine were synthesized in the Delta hdaAstrain. Transcriptional analysis of relevant gene clusters in Delta hdaAand wild strains indicated that disruption ofhdaAhad different effects on the expression levels of two BGCs: the meleagrin/roquefortine BGC was upregulated, while the chrysogine BGC was downregulated. Interestingly, transcriptional analysis demonstrated that different functional genes in the same BGC had different responses to the disruption ofhdaA. Thereinto, theroqOgene, which encodes a key catalyzing enzyme in meleagrin biosynthesis, showed the highest upregulation in the Delta hdaAstrain (84.8-fold). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the upregulation of HdaA inactivation on meleagrin/roquefortine alkaloid production in the endophytic fungusP. chrysogenum. Our results suggest that genetic manipulation based on the epigenetic regulator HdaA is an important strategy for regulating the productions of secondary metabolites and expanding bioactive natural product resources in endophytic fungi.",NA,physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

By using molecular methods, we identified and classified the endophytic fungi obtained into 25 different taxa from the phyla Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. The most abundant species were closely related to Diaporthe phaseolorum, Pestalotiopsis sp. 1, and Preussia pseudominima. The differences observed in endophytic assemblages from different B. trimera specimens might be associated with their crude extract activities. Plants that had higher alpha-biodiversity were also those that contributed more to the regional (gamma) diversity. All fungal isolates were cultured and their crude extracts screened to examine the antimicrobial activities. Twenty-three extracts (12.8%) displayed antimicrobial activities against at least one target microorganism. Among these extracts, those obtained from Epicoccum sp., Pestalotiopsis sp. 1, Cochliobolus lunatus, and Nigrospora sp. presented the best minimum inhibitory concentration values. Our results show that the endophytic fungal community associated with the medicinal plant B. trimera included few dominant bioactive taxa, which may represent sources of compounds with antifungal activity. Additionally, the discovery of these bioactive fungi in association with B. trimera suggests that Brazilian plants used as folk medicine may shelter a rich fungal diversity as well as taxa able to produce bioactive metabolites with antimicrobial activities.",NA,culture_based; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

It is surmised that EPF colonizing plant roots have high diversity. This study aimed to alleviate the scarcity of information regarding EPF in tropical forests, by isolationg and identifying EPF from a tropical forests in Indonesia. Soils were collected from five forests: (1) Tectona grandis monoculture; (2) Swietenia macrophylla monoculture; (3) Gmelina sp., Artocarpus champeden, Dipterocarp mixed; (4) Dipterocarp primary; (5) Macaranga sp. secondary. Four trees (Calliandra calothyrsus, Paraserianthes falcataria, Sesbania grandiflora, and Cassia siamea) and three crops (Sorghum bicolor, Allium fistulosum, and Trifolium repens) were grown in the forest soils to trap EPF. EPF were isolated from roots and isolation rates were calculated. Based on the isolation rates, P. falcataria and S. bicolor were chosen and grown again in forest soils. EPF were isolated and identified by their rDNA ITS1 region. Twelve and 21 EPF were isolated from 250 roots of P. falcataria and 300 roots of S. bicolor, respectively. Identified EPF were from genera Acrocalymma, Fusarium, Tolypocladium, Penicillium, Talaromyces, Exophiala, Dictyosporium, Pseudochaetosphaeronema, Mariannaea, Trichoderma, and Mycoleptodiscus. Acrocalymma, Tolypocladium, Penicillium, Exophiala, Pseudochaetosphaeronema, Mariannaea, and Mycoleptodiscus spp. were isolated from only one forest. Fusarium, Talaromyces, and Trichoderma spp. were isolated from more than one forest. The numbers of EPF isolated from Gmelina sp., Artocarpus champeden, Dipterocarp mixed forest, and Macaranga sp. secondary forest were higher than those from other forests, suggesting that different plant species in forests affect the root EPF community.",root,culture_based; inoculation; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

In endophyte-infected A. inebrians and non-endophyte-infected A. inebrians, ‘Island’, and ‘Hound 6’ as the experimental material, the mass fractions of 0.1%, 0.3%, 0.5%, 0.7%, and 0.9% of the salt solution were used to process seeds, and germination rate, germination potential, vigor index and seedling height, and radicle length index, were measured to establish the related function equation to determine the tolerance values of four kinds of germplasms planted under saline conditions. The results showed that, compared with the control group, the germination rate, germination power, germination index, vigor index, seedling height, and radicle length decreased with increasing salt concentrations, whereas the root-cap ratio showed the opposite trend. Mild salt stress (0.1% and 0.3%) had a positive effect on seed germination and seedling growth (P < 0.05). In the germination stage, the appropriate salt tolerance concentrations of E + A. inebrians, E – A. inebrians, ‘Island’, and ‘Hound 6’ were 0.70%, 0.60%, 0.37%, and 0.49%, respectively.

Because flowering and fungal symbionts are supported by carbohydrates, we hypothesized that flowering modulates root-beneficial fungal associations through alterations in carbohydrate metabolism and transport. We monitored fungal colonization and soluble sugars in the roots of Arabidopsis thaliana following inoculation with a mutualistic fungus Phomopsis liquidambari across different plant developmental stages. Jasmonate signalling of wild-type plants, sugar transport, and root invertase of wild-type and jasmonate-insensitive plants were exploited to assess whether and how jasmonate-dependent sugar dynamics are involved in flowering-mediated fungal colonization alterations. We found that flowering restricts root-fungal colonization and activates root jasmonate signalling upon fungal inoculation. Jasmonates reduce the constitutive and fungus-induced accumulation of root glucose and fructose at the flowering stage. Further experiments with sugar transport and metabolism mutant lines revealed that root glucose and fructose positively influence fungal colonization. Diurnal, jasmonate-dependent inhibitions of sugar transport and soluble invertase activity were identified as likely mechanisms for flowering-mediated root sugar depletion upon fungal inoculation. Collectively, our results reveal that flowering drives root-fungus cooperation loss, which is related to jasmonate-dependent root soluble sugar depletion. Limiting the spread of root-fungal colonization may direct more resources to flower development.",root; flower,culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction,NA,NA,NA,NA

Data generated in vineyards have furthermore highlighted significant regional differences in vineyard biodiversity, hinting at the possibility that such differences might be responsible for regional differences in wine style and character, a hypothesis referred to as ""microbial terroir,"" The current study further contributes to this body of work by comparing the mycobiome associated with South African (SA) Cabernet Sauvignon grapes in three neighboring vineyards that employ different agronomic approaches, and comparing the outcome with similar data sets from Californian vineyards. The aim of this study was to fully characterize the mycobiomes associated with the grapes from these vineyards. The data revealed approximately 10 times more fungal diversity than what is typically retrieved from culture-based studies. The Biodynamic vineyard was found to harbor a more diverse fungal community (H = 2.6) than the conventional (H = 2.1) and integrated (H = 1.8) vineyards. The data show that ascomycota are the most abundant phylum in the three vineyards, with Aureobasidium pullulans and its close relative Kabatiella microsticta being the most dominant fungi. This is the first report to reveal a high incidence of K. microsticta in the grape/wine ecosystem. Different common wine yeast species, such as Metschnikowia pulcherrima and Starmerella bad/fans dominated the mycobiome in the three vineyards. The data show that the filamentous fungi are the most abundant community in grape must although they are not regarded as relevant during wine fermentation. Comparison of metagenomic datasets from the three SA vineyards and previously published data from Californian vineyards revealed only 25% of the fungi in the SA dataset was also present in the Californian dataset, with greater variation evident amongst ubiquitous epiphytic fungi.",style,molecular; culture_based; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

The BAPT gene (C-13 phenylpropanoid side chain-CoA acetyl transferase) involved in the taxol biosynthetic pathway was used as a molecular marker to screen taxol-producing endophytic fungi. Taxol extracted from fungal strain TBPJ-B was identified by HPLC and MS analysis. Strain TBPJ-B was identified as Fusarium redolens based on the morphology and internal transcribed spacer region of nrDNA analysis. HPLC quantification of fungal taxol showed that F. redolens was capable of producing 66 mu g/l of taxol in fermentation broth. The antitumour activity of the fungal taxol was tested by potato disc tumor induction assay using Agrobacterium tumefaciens as the tumor induction agent. The present study results showed that PCR amplification of genes involved in taxol biosynthesis is an efficient and reliable method for prescreening taxol-producing fungi. We are reporting for the first time the production of taxol by F. redolens from Taxus baccata L. subsp. wallichiana (Zucc.) Pilger.

Protection against herbivores has been generally associated with alkaloids produced in the grass-endophyte symbiosis. However, many other changes occur in host metabolism like the release of VOCs. We aimed at characterizing the profile of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) induced by simultaneous fungal endophyte symbiosis and defoliation during the entire life cycle of the annual host grass and the asexual symbiont. We designed an outdoor factorial experiment with plots dominated by intact and damaged Lolium multiflorum plants with high and low infection levels with Epichloe occultans. After exploring the entire VOC profile, the green leaf volatile (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate (Z3-HAC) was found as the main compound emitted by the plants under field conditions. While in low-infected patches there were no differences in volatile emission during the plant life cycle, highly infected patches emitted more Z3-HAC in seedling and vegetative phases than in the reproductive phase. The role of Z3-HAC provided by symbiotic to neighbouring non-symbiotic plants in the associational protection against herbivores and fungal pathogens is discussed.

To improve understanding of the diversity of fungi in the rhizobiome of Populus deltoides, Populus trichocarpa and co-occurring plant hosts Quercus alba and Pinus taeda, we conducted field and greenhouse studies and sampled, isolated, and characterized the diversity of culturable root-associated fungi on these hosts. Using both general and selective isolation media we obtained more than 1800 fungal isolates from individual surface sterilized root tips. Sequences from the ITS and/or D1-D2 regions of the LSU rDNA were obtained from 1042 of the >1800 pure culture isolates and were compared to accessions in the NCBI nucleotide database and analyzed through phylogenetics for preliminary taxonomic identification. Sequences from these isolates were also compared to 454 sequence datasets obtained directly from the Populus rhizosphere and endosphere. Although most of the ectomycorrhizal taxa known to associate with Populus evaded isolation, many of the abundant sequence types from rhizosphere and endosphere 454 datasets were isolated, including novel species belonging to the Atractiellales. Isolation and identification of key endorrhizal fungi will enable more targeted study of plant-fungal interactions. Genome sequencing is currently underway for a subset of our culture library with the aim of understanding the mechanisms involved in host-endophyte establishment and function.

However, the role of endophytic fungi in the response of horticultural plants to plant stress remains largely unknown. Here, we addressed the role of the endophytic fungus Falciphora oryzae in enhancing salt tolerance in pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) by inoculation with the endophyte in the rhizosphere. F. oryzae could indeed colonize the roots of pepper and significantly improved the tolerance of pepper to salt stress. This resulted in increased plant growth and photosynthetic performance compared with control plants, which was accompanied by increases in indole acetic acid and abscisic acid biosynthesis and signaling. Furthermore, inoculation with F. oryzae significantly upregulated a subset of transcripts involved in Na+ homeostasis (NHX3, NHX6, NHX8, HKT2-1, and SOS1) and the high-affinity K+ transporter protein-related gene HAK1 in the leaves to maintain Na+/K+ homeostasis. Moreover, the activity of antioxidant enzymes (catalase, peroxidase, glutathione, and ascorbate peroxidase), the content of glutathione, the transcript level of genes related to antioxidants (catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, peroxidase, glutamate-cysteine ligase, and glutamine synthetase) in the leaves were significantly upregulated after inoculation with F. oryzae, which led to decreased levels of lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde) and reactive oxygen species.

Studying how the soil microbial community responds to these climatic changes will improve our understanding of the impacts of climate changes on arid environments. Therefore, we conducted a field experiment in the Gurbantunggut Desert, applying phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis to assess the responses of soil microbial community to climate change. We found that in years with normal precipitation, increased precipitation promoted soil bacterial growth, whereas in drought years, increased N deposition promoted soil bacterial growth more effectively. Although soil microbial diversity did not change significantly overall, it decreased with increasing N deposition. Random forest analysis and linear regression analysis indicated that soil pH and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) were the main drivers for the changes in soil microbial community. Structural equation modeling (SEM) further revealed that increased precipitation increased soil Gram-positive bacteria (G+) by raising soil MBC, while decreasing soil Actinomycetes (Act), fungi, and Dark Septate Endophyte (DSE). In contrast, increased N deposition affected soil microbial community by altering soil pH and MBC. Our results highlight the synergistic effects of increased precipitation and N deposition on soil microbial community structure.

These bioactive compounds might support a range of plant defense mechanism against many pathogenic microorganisms. In this study, a total of 22 isolates representing 21 fungal species belonging to 15 fungal genera in addition to one variety were isolated and identified for the first time from Euphorbia geniculate plants. The genus Aspergillus was the most common fungus isolated from the studied plant. The fungus Isaria feline was recorded in both leaves and stem, while Aspergillus flavus, A. ochraceus, A. terreus var. terreus, Emercilla nidulans var. acristata, Macrophomina phaseolina colonized both stem and root.

The presence of endophytes in grasses can confer resistance to insect pests, enhance growth, and improve tall fescue persistence under high temperature and drought stress. Most tall fescue is infected with Acremonium cenophialum Morgan-Jones & Gams, a fungal endophyte. Our objectives were to determine the effects of endophyte infection on water relations and survival of water stressed (i.e., drought-stressed) tall fescue under greenhouse conditions. Endophyte-free and infected plants of three tall fescue selections were vegetatively propagated and grown together in 38-L weighing lysimeters to allow interplant competition for available soil moisture. Irrigation water and fertilizer were applied for 12 wk after planting before irrigation water was withheld for 8 wk. Water-relation characteristics including full-turgor osmotic potential (psi(pi100)), water potential at zero turgor (psi(L0)), relative water content at zero turgor (RWC0), apoplastic water fraction (beta), bulk modulus of tissue elasticity (epsilon), and the turgid weight to dry weight ratio (TW/DW) were determined before and after water stress. Osmotic adjustment (DELTApsi(pi)) was also determined. Endophyte infection did not affect psi(pi100), psi(L0), RWC0, and beta either before or after water stress and did not affect DELTApsi(pi). Endophyte infection did affect epsilon and the TW/DW ratio, but this effect was not sufficient to alter psi(L0). Total tillers, tiller survival, plant survival, and recovery weights were similar for endophyte-free and - infected plants.

We isolated 69 phylotypes of endophytic fungi in at least 39 genera, including 26 that have not previously been reported in P. monticola. Principal components analysis revealed that endophyte communities differed between browsed seedlings, unbrowsed seedlings, and unbrowsed adult trees. Sulfur, nitrate and calcium concentrations correlated with endophyte community differences among tree groups based on a distance-based redundancy analysis.

Using biochemical and cytological approaches we show that one of these lectins, SiWSC3 with three WSC domains, is an integral fungal cell wall component that binds to long-chain beta 1-3-glucan but has no affinity for shorter beta 1-3- or beta 1-6-linked glucose oligomers. Comparative analysis with the previously identified beta-glucan-binding lectin SiFGB1 demonstrated that whereas SiWSC3 does not require beta 1-6-linked glucose for efficient binding to branched beta 1-3-glucan, SiFGB1 does. In contrast to SiFGB1, the multivalent SiWSC3 lectin can efficiently agglutinate fungal cells and is additionally induced during fungus-fungus confrontation, suggesting different functions for these two beta-glucan-binding lectins.

I-62, three were pre-selected. To improve sugar production, an autohydrolysis pretreatment was performed before or after fungal treatment. Pretreatment increased sugar production 2.7 times compared to non-pretreated wood. When fungal and autohydrolysis pretreatments were combined, a synergistic increase in saccharification was observed in all cases. Endophytic fungi Ulocladium sp. and Hormonema sp. produced greater enhancements in saccharification than Trametes sp. I-62 (increase in sugar yields of 8.5, 8.0 and 6.0 times, respectively), demonstrating the high potential of these new endophytic fungi for saccharification enhancement. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

10.1007/s00442-002-0966-9,Gilbert_2002.pdf,Fungal diversity and plant disease in mangrove forests:: salt excretion as a possible defense mechanism,To Search,"Salt excretion in leaves of some mangrove species may serve as an important defense against fungal attack, reducing the vulnerability of typically high-density, monospecific forest stands to severe disease pressure. In field surveys of a Caribbean mangrove forest in Panama, Avicennia germinans suffered much less damage from foliar diseases than did Laguncularia racemosa or Rhizophora mangle. Similarly, Avicennia leaves supported the least superficial fungal growth, endophytic colonization, and diversity, followed by Laguncularia and Rhizophora. Host specificity of leaf-colonizing fungi was greater than expected at random. We hypothesize that the different salt tolerance mechanisms in the three mangrove species may differentially regulate fungal colonization. The mangroves differ in their salt tolerance mechanisms such that Avicennia (which excretes salt through leaf glands) has the highest salinity of residual rain water on leaves, Laguncularia (which accumulates salt in the leaves) has the greatest bulk salt concentration, and Rhizophora (which excludes salt at the roots) has little salt associated with leaves. The high salt concentrations associated with leaves of Avicennia and Laguncularia, but not the low salinity of Rhizophora, were sufficient to inhibit the germination of many fungi associated with mangrove forests.",leaf; root,microscopy; inoculation; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, a collection of 56 strains of endophytic fungi were isolated from different organs of cultivated Panax ginseng, of which seven strains can be symbiotically co-cultured with the hairy roots of P. ginseng. Further experiments observed that strain 3R-2, identified as endophytic fungus Schizophyllum commune, can not only infect hairy roots but also promote the accumulation of specific ginsenosides. This was further verified because S. commune colonization significantly affected the overall metabolic profile of ginseng hairy roots. By comparing the effects of S. commune mycelia and its mycelia extract (EM) on ginsenoside production in P. ginseng hairy roots, the EM was confirmed to be a relatively better stimulus elicitor. Additionally, the introduction of EM elicitor can significantly enhance the expressions of key enzyme genes of pgHMGR, pgSS, pgSE, and pgSD involved in the biosynthetic pathway of ginsenosides, which was deemed the most relevant factor for promoting ginsenosides production during the elicitation period. In conclusion, this study is the first to show that the EM of endophytic fungus S. commune can be considered as an effective endophytic fungal elicitor for increasing the biosynthesis of ginsenosides in hairy root cultures of P. ginseng.",root,culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

A 100-mu M Cd application to host, Sitiens and Rhe reduced the shoot growth, chlorophyll content and stomatal conductance. However, these parameters were significantly (P < 0.0011) higher (1.0- to 2.6-folds) in host, Sitiens and Rhe under endophytic association than in non-endophyte infected plants (control) under Cd stress. Furthermore, endophytic association minimized the Cd-induced membrane injury and oxidative stress to host, Sitiens and Rhe plants by reducing electrolytes and lipid peroxidation while increasing the content of reduced glutathione and catalase activities as compared to non-endophyte-infected plants. Stress-responsive ABA content significantly increased (similar to 2-folds) in Sitiens and Rhe under endophyte association, while in host plants it was decreased under Cd stress. Salicylic acid content was similar to aEuro parts per thousand 1.7-fold higher in host, Sitiens and Rhe plants under Cd stress and endophyte association than in the control. Besides gibberellins production, the endophyte has the potential to solubilize phosphates (12.73 +/- 0.24 mg/l) since higher P was observed in the roots of Sitiens, Rhe and host plants. Similarly, nutrients like sulfur and calcium were more efficiently assimilated in roots of endophyte-associated plants than control under Cd stress. Conversely, Cd accumulation was significantly decreased (P < 0.001) in the roots of endophyte-inoculated host, Sitiens and Rhe than control. In conclusion, endophyte symbiosis can counteract heavy metal stress which can exert negative effects on plant growth.",shoot; stomatal; root; stoma,inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA
10.3389/fmicb.2021.756991,von_2021.pdf,Genetic Diversity of the Symbiotic Fungus Epichloe festucae in Naturally Occurring Host Grass Populations,To Search,"Epichloe festucae is a common symbiont of the perennial and widely distributed cool season grass, Festuca rubra. The symbiosis is highly integrated involving systemic growth of the fungus throughout above-ground host parts and vertical transmission from plant to its offspring via host seeds. However, the nature of symbiosis is labile ranging from antagonistic to mutualistic depending on prevailing selection pressures. Both the loss of fungus in the maternal host lineage and horizontal transmission through sexual spores within the host population may partly explain the detected variation in symbiosis in wild grass populations. Epichloe species are commonly considered as pathogens when they produce sexual spores and partly castrate their host plant. This is the pathogenic end of the continuum from antagonistic to mutualistic interactions. Here we examined the population genetic structure of E. festucae to reveal the gene flow, importance of reproduction modes, and alkaloid potential of the symbiotic fungus in Europe. Epichloe-species are highly dependent on the host in survival and reproduction whilst benefits to the host are largely linked to defensive mutualism attributable to fungal-origin bioactive alkaloids that negatively affect vertebrate and/or invertebrate herbivores. We detected decreased genetic diversity in previously glaciated areas compared to non-glaciated regions during the last glacial maximum period and found three major genetic clusters in E. festucae populations: southern, northeastern and northwestern Europe. Sexual reproduction may have a higher role than expected in Spanish E. festucae populations due to the predominance of unique genotypes and presence of both mating types in the region. In contrast, asexual reproduction via host seeds predominates in the Faroe Island and Finland in northern Europe due to the presence of biased mating-type ratios and large dominant genotypes in the E. festucae populations within the region. A substantially larger variation of alkaloid genotypes was observed in the fungal populations than expected, although the variability of the alkaloid genotypes within populations is considerably lower in northern than Spanish populations in southern Europe. E. festucae populations consist of different combinations of alkaloid classes from the gene clusters of ergot alkaloid and indole-terpenes, and from pyrrolopyrazine alkaloid gene. We suggest that the postglacial distribution history of the host grass, prevailing reproduction strategies of E. festucae, and local selection pressures likely explain a large part of the genetic variation observed in fungal populations among geographic regions. The identified alkaloid genotypes can be used by turfgrass breeders to improve resistance against herbivores in red fescue varieties and to develop new sustainable cultivars in Europe.",seed,plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, its study is currently limited because of its relative shortage of natural abundance. The objective of this work was to find an alternative resource from this plant that could produce its bioactive ingredients. Methods and Results We isolated endophytic fungi from the twigs of Loranthus tanakae Franch. & Sav and eight flavonoid-producing endophytic fungi were selected. The eight endophytic fungi meeting the criteria were identified as Alternaria tenuissima, Dothiorella gregaria, Penicillium aethiopicum, Nothophoma quercina and Hypoxylon perforatum by morphological and molecular methods. The antioxidant and antibacterial activities of the flavonoid-producing endophytic fungi were investigated in vitro, where Alternaria tenuissima ZP28 and ZM148 demonstrated greater activities than the other six strains. Flavonoids of ZP28 and ZM148 were preliminarily identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Conclusion After screening the flavonoid-producing endophytic fungi, Alternaria tenuissima ZP28 and ZM148 were found to have good antioxidant and antibacterial activities. Overall, this study provided new direction and resources for the acquisition of flavonoids. Significance and impact of the study Endophytic fungi are a promising alternative approach for the large-scale production of flavonoids from Loranthus tanakae Franch. & Sav.",twig; scale,molecular; culture_based; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, we investigated the growth of Paraboeremia selaginellae strains and their enhancing of cadmium (Cd) tolerance and growth in Salvia miltiorrhiza in Cd-contaminated soil.Methods First, we tested the Cd resistance of P. selaginellae by in vitro culture. Then, we studied the performance of S. miltiorrhiza inoculated with P. selaginellae in Cd-contaminated soil.Results It was found that P. selaginellae possessed a capacity to accumulate Cd in its mycelium. The Cd-contaminated environment increased the content of melanin and osmotic substances and reduced the proportion of the highly toxic chemical form of Cd in the mycelium of P. selaginellae. In Cd-contaminated soil, P. selaginellae effectively colonized plant roots and improved soil nutrients and the growth of S. miltiorrhiza. The P. selaginellae-inoculated treatment significantly increased the contents of effective nitrogen (37.74%), urease (31.55%), and alkaline phosphatase (29.82%) in 10 mg Cd/kg soil, compared with the non-inoculated treatment. More importantly, P. selaginellae inoculation increased root biomass for 5 and 10 mg Cd/kg soil by 42.35% and 30.21%, respectively, in comparison to non-inoculated control. Inoculation with P. selaginellae reduced the proportion of the highly toxic chemical form of soil Cd, and reduced the accumulation of Cd in plants, especially in the roots.Discussion These results indicated that DSEs have a positive influence on the growth and Cd tolerance of S. miltiorrhiza, and reduce the biological toxicity of soil Cd. Therefore, exploitation and utilization of DSEs resources might be a new method for improving the cultivation of medicinal plants and soil microenvironment in heavy metal-contaminated areas.",root,culture_based; inoculation,NA,NA,NA,NA

Darbysh.] often benefits in terms of productivity and persistence when infected with Neotyphodium coenophialum ([Morgan-Jones and Gams], Glenn, Bacon, and Hanlin) endophyte, but the influence of novel non-ergogenic endophytes is unclear. We conducted a field experiment using container-grown tall fescue plants to determine how plants allocated resources when clipped repeatedly in microsites differing in the amount of available light associated with open (full sun), and partially shaded (about 20 or 40% of full sun) conditions. Plants of the same tall fescue cultivar (Jesup) were host to either a native or novel non-ergogenic fungal endophyte (MaxQ (TM)), or were devoid of endophyte. Seedlings of plants infected with the novel endophyte had slower germination, germinated later, and allocated more photosynthate to shoots than roots, when compared to J- or J+ plants. Herbage production of undisturbed canopies was not influenced by host-endophyte association within a microsite, with more herbage produced at the open than at the heavily shaded site. Clipping plants to a 5- or a 10-cm residue height tended to accentuate differences, with diminished productivity and greater variability occurring when plants were maintained at 5 cm. This trend was supported by allometric resource allocation patterns, and in terms of vegetative propagule mass relative to the number of propagules. Tall fescue, irrespective of host-endophyte association, grown as forage in silvopastoral situations should be managed to maintain no less than a 10-cm residual plant height. Trends in photosynthate allocation and plant size might influence persistence and should be investigated for more than two growing seasons. Published by Elsevier B.V.",shoot; root,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These pathogens genetically transform the host plant and thus form an ecological niche (galls) in which specific metabolites (i.e., opines) are produced. Opines provide the pathogen with multiple competitive advantages, but they can also be utilized by other bacteria colonizing galls. To gain a thorough understanding of disease processes and ecology, it is necessary to consider the pathogen in the context of its microbial environment within the diseased plant (i.e., the pathobiome). Therefore, in this study, we investigated the bacterial pathobiome associated with aerial crown gall tumors (gallobiome) on rhododendron. For this purpose, a combination of cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent approaches were applied, which also involved development of a novel amplicon sequencing approach targeting the recA housekeeping gene. The 16S rRNA and recA gene amplicon sequencing clearly indicated that Rhizobium rhododendri and the group of Agrobacterium spp. primarily belonging to the so-called ""rubi"" clade were the dominant members of bacterial microbiota in rhododendron galls. While the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid-harboring R. rhododendri strains are causative agents of crown gall disease, Agrobacterium spp. strains isolated in this study were nonpathogenic and carried genes for the catabolism of opines, enabling these bacteria to efficiently colonize tumor tissue. Taken together, our results clearly showed that the tumorigenic R. rhododendri and nonpathogenic opine-catabolizing Agrobacterium spp. were the key players within the bacterial microbiota associated with aerial crown gall tumors on rhododendron.Copyright (c) 2024 The Author(s).

So far, people have discovered more than 130 small molecule compounds of natural origin for anti-tumor, of which approximately 50% are of microbial origin. The Acanthus ilicifolius L. species is primarily distributed in the Guangdong, Hainan, and Guangxi regions of China and grows in tidally accessible coastal areas. Recent studies have revealed that Acanthus ilicifolius L. extracts are endowed with a range of pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, antioxidant, and antitumor activities. Endophytic fungi are commonly found in the healthy tissue and organs of medicinal plants. These fungi and the plants they inhabit form mutually beneficial symbiotic relationships. Endophytic fungi produce a series of secondary metabolites, with active substances having shown great economic value and applications prospects in drug research and development as well as for the biological control of plant diseases. Secondary metabolites production by endophytic fungi is regulated by specific gene clusters, and several techniques have been used to stimulate the secondary metabolic processes of fungi, including epigenetic-modification and OSMAC (one strain many compounds) strategies, co-culturing, and gene modification. Among these, epigenetic modification has been shown to be effective; this strategy involves the addition of small-molecule epigenetic modifiers to the culture medium, thereby activating silenced biosynthetic gene clusters without altering the DNA sequences of the fungi. This approach facilitates the expression of silenced genes in endophytic fungi, thereby increasing the number and diversity of secondary metabolites. Furthermore, it assists in overcoming the inhibition of microbial secondary-metabolite synthesis under laboratory conditions, and enhances silenced-gene expressions. The advent of novel analytical techniques and bioinformatics has provided a comprehensive, multifaceted, and holistic understanding of fungal metabolism through the development of metabolomics as a research platform. However, few studies have combined anti-ovarian cancer-activity screening with metabolomic approaches in the search for activity-differentiating metabolites from endophytic fungi under the intervention of epigenetic modifiers. Herein, we investigated the impact of epigenetic modifiers on the secondary metabolites of the endophytic Diaporthe goulteri fungus from Acanthus ilicifolius L. to determine their potential anti-ovarian cancer activities. Crude extracts were obtained by controlling three variables: the number of fermentation days, the type of epigenetic modifier, and its concentration, with activities screened using the CCK-8 (cell counting kit-8) method. Ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was subsequently employed for non-targeted metabolomic analysis. A multivariate statistical analysis model was constructed using principal component analysis and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis, which combines model and variable importance projection, with qualitative screening performed and significant changes (variable importance in the projection (VIP)>= 1; P<0. 05) determined. Fifteen differential metabolites were identified in the fungal and epigenetic modification group, primarily comprising polyketides, amino acids, derivatives, alkaloids, and organic acids, including prenderol, glycine, valine, 2-ethylcaproic acid, rubratoxin B, finasteride, 6-silaspiro[5. 5]undecane, 1-(2-nitrophenoxy)octane, heptadecene, 1-pentadecene, 11-ketoetiocholanolone, 3-(1-ethyl-1,3,3-trimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-5-yl)butanal, N-2-benzoylarginine, tabutrex, (3aR,6S,6aS)-6-(4-hydroxy-2-methoxy-2-butanyl)-4,4-dimethylhexahydro-1(2H)-pentalenone, and 8-aminoquinoline. The expressions of prenderol, 1-(2-nitrophenoxy)octane, 3-(1-ethyl-1,3,3-trimethyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-5-yl)butanal, N-2-benzoylarginine, and 8-aminoquinoline were downregulated, whereas the expressions of the remaining 10 substances were upregulated. Polyketides were the main components that exhibited higher expressions. This study showed that latent active differential metabolites can be searched by combining anti-ovarian cancer-activity screening with metabolomics analysis, thereby providing a reference for the further development of Acanthus ilicifolius L. resources and the subsequent targeted isolation of active compounds.",tumor,molecular; culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many of these endophytes produce alkaloids that enhance their hosts' resistance to insects or are toxic to grazing mammals. The goals of eliminating from forage grasses factors such as ergot alkaloids that are responsible for livestock disorders, while retaining pasture sustainability, and of developing resistant turf grasses, require better understanding of how particular alkaloids affect insect herbivores. We used perennial ryegrass Lolium perenne L. (Poaceae) symbiotic with Neotyphodium lolii x Epichloe typhina isolate Lp1 (a natural interspecific hybrid), as well as with genetically modified strains of Lp1 with altered ergot alkaloid profiles, to test effects of ergot alkaloids on feeding, growth, and survival of the black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a generalist grass-feeding caterpillar. Neonates or late instars were provided clippings from glasshouse-grown plants in choice and rearing trials. Wild-type endophytic grass showed strong antixenosis and antibiosis, especially to neonates. Plant-endophyte symbiota from which complex ergot alkaloids (ergovaline and lysergic acid amides such as ergine) or all ergot alkaloids were eliminated by endophyte gene knockout retained significant resistance against neonates. However, this activity was reduced compared to that of wild-type Lp1, providing the first direct genetic evidence that ergot alkaloids contribute to insect resistance of endophytic grasses. Similarity of larval response to the two mutants suggested that ergovaline and/or ergine account for the somewhat greater potency of wild-type Lp1 compared to the knockouts, whereas simpler ergot alkaloids contribute little to that added resistance. All of the endophyte strains also produced peramine, which was probably their primary resistance component. This study suggests that ergot alkaloids can be eliminated from an endophyte of perennial ryegrass while retaining significant insect resistance.",NA,culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

The recently described nematode Litylenchus crenatae subsp. mccannii was detected in BLD-affected foliage and may be associated with the disease. However, speculation on the direct role of the nematode in infection still remains. In this study, we profiled the microbial communities associated with asymptomatic, symptomatic, and naive (control) American beech foliage by using a high-throughput sequence-based metabarcoding analysis of fungi, bacteria, phytoplasmas, and nematodes. We then used both a differential abundance analysis and indicator species analysis as well as several diversity metrics to try and discover microbes associated only with symptomatic foliage. To do so, we amplified the organism-specific phylogenetic informative regions of the 16S, 18S, and internal transcribed spacer (ITS)1 regions using Illumina MiSeq. Our results detected the amplicon sequence variant (ASV) associated with the nematode L. crenatae subsp. mccannii but in all symptom types. However, four ASVs associated with the bacterial genera Wolbachia, Erwinia, Paenibacillus, and Pseudomonas and one ASV associated with the fungal genus Paraphaeosphaeria were detected only in symptomatic samples. In addition, we identified significant differences based on symptom type in both the alpha- and beta-diversity indices for the bacterial and fungal communities. These results suggest that L. crenatae subsp. mccannii may not be fully responsible for BLD but, rather, that other microbes may be contributing to the syndrome, including the putative nematode endosymbiont Wolbachia sp.",leaf; foliage,molecular; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Endophytic fungi were isolated from the leaves of C. roseus, identified as Curvularia verruculosa by molecular techniques, and the sequence was deposited in NCBI (MK995628). Vinblastine producing endophytic fungus was grown in 1L Vinca medium for 21 days. The extract was examined for vinblastine by chromatographic techniques. TLC plates showed purple colour spot co-migrated with authentic vinblastine and R-f was calculated by HPTLC (Vin 1 vinblastine - 0.75; authentic vinblastine-0.78), these results confirmed vinblastine presence in the Vin1 extract. Further, the TLC purified fungal extract was examined by LC-MS, which revealed the exact mass of vinblastine ([M + H](+) m/z 811.51). The most important of the study is high yield production of vinblastine; hence, the extract analysed by HPLC revealed 182 mu g/L vinblastine. The TLC purified fungal vinblastine was analysed for the cytotoxicity effect on HeLa cell line and it depicted a higher activity with IC50 -8.5 mu g/mL and apoptotic morphological changes were analysed.

The effects of this symbiosis can be both negative and positive. The negative effect may be due to alkaloids produced by endophytes that in higher concentrations are toxic to animals. The most common alkaloids produced by Neotyphodium fungi are ergovaline and lolitrem B. The current state of knowledge on the settlement of grasses by these fungi in Poland is rather small. It has been observed that fungi from the genus Neotyphodium occurring in a pasture sward can produce alkaloids. The average ergovaline content in grass from the permanent pasture in some areas exceeded the threshold level above which disease symptoms in animals may occur. The aim of this paper was to present a clinical case of ergovaline intoxication in a herd of 30 dairy cows. Out of the 30 animals, in 10 self amputation of the tails and visual disturbances were observed. Ergovaline poisoning was diagnosed on the basis of the results of analysis of the sera of infected animals by mass spectrometer. It enabled detecting a specific fraction in the serum of sick cows that was identified as ergovaline. The case of ergovaline poisoning confirmed by laboratory tests indicates that in some areas poisoning with this alkaloid may be a significant problem in the breeding of ruminant animals, which should be considered in the differential diagnosis of diseases with necrosis of the terminal parts of the body and decreased milk production.",NA,plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Dwarf Cavendish) root endophytome comparing two phenological plant stages: mother plants and suckers. Moreover, a collection of culturable root endophytes (>1000) was also generated from Canary Islands. In vitro antagonism assays against Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense (Foc) races STR4 and TR4 enabled the identification and characterization of potential biocontrol agents (BCA). Eventually, three of them were selected and evaluated against Fusarium wilt of banana (FWB) together with the well-known BCA Pseudomonas simiae PICF7 under controlled conditions. Culturable and non-culturable (high-throughput sequencing) approaches provided concordant information and showed low microbial diversity within the banana root endosphere. Pseudomonas appeared as the dominant genus and seemed to play an important role in the banana root endophytic microbiome according to co-occurrence networks. Fungal communities were dominated by the genera Ophioceras, Cyphellophora, Plecosphaerella, and Fusarium. Overall, significant differences were found between mother plants and suckers, suggesting that the phenological stage determines the recruitment and organization of the endophytic microbiome. While selected native banana endophytes showed clear antagonism against Foc strains, their biocontrol performance against FWB did not improve the outcome observed for a non-indigenous reference BCA (strain PICF7).",root,molecular; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of mixed inoculation with native mycorrhizae, two yeasts and one endophytic bacterium, on the growth of two poplar clones commonly used in Patagonia, Argentina. Yeasts and bacteria were selected base on their ability to produce IAA and siderophores, as well as P solubilization in-vitro. A greenhouse trial was performed using hardwood cuttings of Populus nigra 'Italica' and Populus trichocarpa 'SP1456'. Only yeasts modified growth traits, in a host-related response: Tausonia pullulans reduced the root/shoot ratio in P. nigra, and Candida saitoana and increased shoot dry biomass in P. trichocarpa. All plants presented arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization but ectomycorrhizae were absent. Two types of arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization were observed, one of them similar to Glomus tenue.

10.1111/ele.14073,Bastías_2022.pdf,Factors controlling the effects of mutualistic bacteria on plants associated with fungi,To Search,"Plants interacting with mutualistic fungi (MF) or antagonistic fungi (AF) can form associations with bacteria. We assessed whether the performance gain conferred by mutualistic bacteria to fungal-associated plants is affected by the interaction between symbiont traits, type of bacterial-protective traits against AF and abiotic/biotic stresses. Results showed that (A) performance gain conferred by bacteria to MF-associated plants was greater when symbionts promoted distinct rather than similar plant functions, (B) bacterial-based alleviation of the AF's negative effect on plants was independent of the type of protective trait, (C) bacteria promoted a greater performance of symbiotic plants in presence of biotic, but not abiotic, stress compared to stress-free situations. The plant performance gain was not affected by any fungal-bacterial trait combination but optimised when bacteria conferred resistance traits in biotic stress situations. The effects of bacteria on fungal-associated plants were controlled by the interaction between the symbionts' functional traits and the relationship between bacterial traits and abiotic/biotic stresses.",NA,plant_microbe_interaction,NA,NA,NA,NA

Undifilum. The ecological role of this endophyte across the mutualism-commensalism-parasitism continuum is unknown. We examined the fitness traits of Astragalus and Oxytropis species growing with and without the endophyte, in a 9-yr, common-garden experiment. Silky crazyweed (Oxytropis sericea Nutt.) and woolly loco (Astragalus mollissimus Torr.) plants germinated from seeds that naturally host the endophyte (E+) and with it mechanically removed (E-) were established in a common garden in southwest Montana. We measured mortality, gas exchange, flower and seed production, seed germination, and final biomass. Astragalus mollissimus plants grew as annuals under common-garden conditions regardless of endophyte status. Oxytropis sericea plants grew as perennials with survival unaffected by endophyte; however, E+ O. sericea plants produced slightly more reproductive stems, flowers per stem, and crown and stem biomass. Maternal effects detected in the parental generation disappeared in subsequent generations. Gas exchange, fecundity, and seed germination were unaffected by endophyte. Contrary to our initial hypothesis of mutualism, the endophyte did not improve host survival or fecundity, nor did we detect transgenerational effects. However, the endophyte did slightly increase the number of reproductive stems and flowers per stem and crown and stem mass in O. sericea, suggesting endophytic effects on carbohydrate biochemistry and pollination parameters should be examined. Lack of selection for or against endophyte-containing plants allows both nontoxic and toxic swainsonine-producing plants to persist in Astragalus and Oxytropis populations, posing a continued threat to grazing livestock.",seed; flower; stem; crown,plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Combining natural compounds with antimicrobial agents is an alternative approach to improve the antibacterial efficacy and safety of these agents. The strategy is to restore the effectiveness of existing antibiotics while minimizing the required concentrations of antibiotics or antimicrobial agents. This study aimed to isolate the endophytic fungi from medicinal plants, including Lantana camara, Orthosiphon aristatus, Mansonia gagei, Terminalia bellirica, Oroxylum indicum, Elaeagnus latifolia, Talinum paniculatum, and Capsicum annuum, and evaluate the combined antibacterial efficacy with selected antibiotics or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts was assessed using agar well diffusion and broth microdilution methods. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the extracts were 32-64 mu g/mL against Escherichia coli, and 512-2,048 mu g/mL against P. aeruginosa, respectively. Time-kill assays demonstrated the bacteriostatic effect of the extracts. The checkerboard microbroth dilution method was performed to determine the synergistic effect between endophytic fungal extracts and antibiotics or EDTA. The synergistic effect was observed in the extractions of endophytic fungi isolated from M. gagei, T. bellirica, O. indicum, E. latifolia, T. paniculatum, and C. annuum combined with EDTA against P. aeruginosa. Combinations of endophytic fungi with EDTA, which exhibited a synergistic effect, demonstrated bactericidal action against Gram-negative bacteria. The present study suggests that combining endophytic fungal extracts and EDTA could be an essential strategy for combating pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria.",NA,culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Therefore, the study was focussed to examine whether fungal endophyte colonisation and the accumulation of secondary metabolites, such as flavonoids and phenols, in the plants are related in any way. For this reason, the study aims to analyse phenols and flavonoids from the fronds of eleven pteridophytes along with the culture-dependent isolation of fungal endophytes from the host plants subsequently assigning them to morphological category and their quantitative analysis and further resolving its identities through molecular affiliation. The results revealed that nine morpho-categories of fungal endophytes were allotted based on culture attributes, hyphal patterns and reproductive structural characters. Highest numbers of species were isolated from Adiantum capillus-veneris and least was recorded from Pteris vittata and Dicranopteris linearis. Maximum phenol content was analysed from the fronds of P. vittata and lowest was recorded in A. capillus-veneris. Highest flavonoid content was measured in D. linearis and lowest was detected in Christella dentata. Significant negative correlation was observed between phenol content of ferns and species richness of fungi. Moreover, significant positive correlation was observed with the relative abundance of Chaetomium globosum and flavonoid content of ferns and negative significant relation was found between relative abundance of Pseudopestalotiopsis chinensis and phenol content of pteridophytes.

Dioscorea nipponica Makino accumulates abundant steroidal saponins, which can be hydrolyzed to produce diosgenin. However, our understanding of the associated endophytes and their contributions to plant growth and diosgenin production is limited. The present study aimed to assess the PGP ability and potential of diosgenin biotransformation by endophytes isolates associated with D. nipponica for the efficient improvement of plant growth and development of a clean and effective approach for producing the valuable drug diosgenin. Eighteen bacterial endophytes were classified into six genera through sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA gene. Similarly, 12 fungal endophytes were categorized into 5 genera based on sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the ITS rDNA gene. Pure culture experiments revealed that 30 isolated endophytic strains exhibited one or more PGP traits, such as nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, siderophore synthesis, and IAA production. One strain of endophytic bacteria, P. peoriae SYbr421, effectively directly biotransformed the saponin components in D. nipponica. Moreover, a high yield of diosgenin (3.50%) was obtained at an inoculum size of 4% after 6 days of fermentation. Thus, SYbr421 could be used for a cleaner and more eco-friendly diosgenin production process. In addition, based on the assessment of growth-promoting isolates and seed germination results, the strains SYbr421, SYfr1321, and SYfl221 were selected for greenhouse experiments. The results revealed that the inoculation of these promising isolates significantly increased the plant height and fresh weight of the leaves and roots compared to the control plants. These findings underscore the importance of preparing PGP bioinoculants from selected isolates as an additional option for sustainable diosgenin production.",seed; leaf; root,molecular; culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Endophytic fungi of three types of tree peonies were isolated and identified. The diversity was analyzed. Bayesian trees constructed by MrBayes 3.2.6 after phylogenetic analysis of the ITS sequences. The endophytic fungi potential for synthesis of natural products was assessed by means of detecting NRPS and PKS gene sequences. In total, 364 endophytic fungi isolates representing 26 genera were recovered from Paeonia ostii 'Feng Dan', Paeonia ostii 'Luoyang Feng Dan', and Paeonia suffruticosa 'Luoyang Hong'. More culturable endophytic fungi appeared in P. suffruticosa 'Luoyang Hong' (206) compared with P. ostii 'Feng Dan' (60) and P. ostii 'Luoyang Feng Dan' (98). The fungal community of P. ostii 'Feng Dan' had the highest richness and diversity. PKSs and NRPS detection rates of endophytic fungi from P. ostii 'Feng Dan' are both the highest among the three types of tree peonies. Results indicate that endophytic fungus is an important factor of Daodi Cortex Moutan forming, and endophytic fungi in peony are related to genuineness of Cortex Moutan.

However, how they are affected simultaneously by the host plant cultivar, local environment, and agricultural practices was not well understood. We used boxwood, an iconic landscape plant and a major evergreen shrub crop in the United States nursery industry, as a model plant and sequenced 16S rRNA and ITS amplicons to examine the assemblages of endophytic bacteria and fungi in the shoots of four cultivars representing three levels of boxwood blight resistance under two distinct climates and production systems in Oregon and Virginia. Cultivar and local environment were the two main drivers shaping the composition and structure of the boxwood endophytic microbial community, particularly the fungal community. Three bacterial and seven fungal genera were consistently identified with high prevalence and abundance as the core taxa from four cultivars and two locations across three sampling times. The microbial composition varied among the levels of boxwood blight resistance, and taxa specific to the tolerant cultivar were fewer compared to the susceptible one. Identification of these microbial indicators, along with the core taxa, is foundational for developing a microbiome-based plant breeding program and a systems approach to improve boxwood health and production under a changing climate.Copyright (c) 2024 The Author(s).

However, whether floral volatile organic compounds (VOCs) affect the composition and function of the endophytic fungal community remains unclear. Here, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-throughput sequencing were used to explore the relationship between floral VOCs and the endophytic fungal community during different flower development stages in Osmanthus fragrans 'Rixiang Gui'. The results showed that the composition of the endophytic fungal community and floral VOCs shifted along with flowering development. The highest and lowest alpha diversity of the endophytic fungal community occurred in the flower fading stage and full blooming stage, respectively. The dominant fungi, including Dothideomycetes (class), Pleosporales (order), and Neocladophialophora, Alternaria, and Setophoma (genera), were enriched in the flower fading stage and decreased in the full blooming stage, demonstrating the enrichment of the Pathotroph, Saprotroph, and Pathotroph-Saprotroph functions in the flower fading stage and their depletion in the full blooming stage. However, the total VOC and terpene contents were highest in the full blooming stage and lowest in the flower fading stage, which was opposite to the alpha diversity of the endophytic fungal community and the dominant fungi during flowering development. Linalool, dihydro-beta-ionone, and trans-linalool oxide(furan) were key factors affecting the endophytic fungal community composition. Furthermore, dihydro-beta-ionone played an extremely important role in inhibiting endophytic fungi in the full blooming stage. Based on the above results, it is believed that VOCs, especially terpenes, changed the endophytic fungal community composition in the flowers of O. fragrans 'Rixiang Gui'. These findings improve the understanding of the interaction between endophytic fungi and VOCs in flowers and provide new insight into the mechanism of flower development.",flower,molecular; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Natural products represent credible sources of new antiplasmodial agents for antimalarial drug development. Endophytes that widely colonize healthy tissues of plants have been shown to synthesize a great variety of secondary metabolites that might possess antiplasmodial benefits. The present study was carried out to evaluate the antiplasmodial potential of extracts from endophytic fungi isolated from Symphonia globulifera against a chloroquine-resistant strain of Plasmodium falciparum (PfINDO). Sixty-one fungal isolates with infection frequency of 67.77% were obtained from the bark of S. globulifera. Twelve selected isolates were classified into six different genera including Fusarium, Paecilomyces, Penicillium, Aspergillus, Mucor, and Bipolaris. Extracts from the 12 isolates were tested against PfINDO, and nine showed good activity (IC50 < 10 mu g.mL(-1)) with three fungi including Paecilomyces lilacinus (IC50 = 0.44 mu g.mL(-1)), Penicillium janthinellum (IC50 = 0.2 mu g.mL(-1)), and Paecilomyces sp. (IC50 = 0.55 mu g.mL(-1)) showing the highest promise. These three isolates were found to be less cytotoxic against the HEK293T cell line with selectivity indices ranging from 24.52 to 70.56.

The endophytic fungal assemblages from salt-tolerant wheat genotypes (KRL-213, KRL-210 and KRL-19) and from salt-sensitive wheat genotype (PBW-343) were characterized, identified and determined for the current study. Of the fifty fungal isolates collected from both the salt-tolerant and the salt-sensitive wheat genotypes, 8 isolates recovered from salt-tolerant varieties were found to be resistant at high salt concentrations. These 8 isolates were characterized through several biochemical tests, such as plant growth promoting assay, extracellular enzymatic assay, carbohydrate utilization assay, antagonism versus plants pathogens and capacity to promote wheat seedlings (pot experiments). All tests revealed the positive results for 4 fungal strains (K13TR/150, K19TR/200, K-19TL/150 and K-19TL/200). These 4 fungi were identified as Aspergillus medius (K19TR/200), Cladosporium parahalotolerant (K13TR/150), Aspergillus versicolor (K19TL/150) and Aspergillus nishimurae (K19TL/200) through 18 S rDNA sequencing. Out of these, C. parahalotolerant and A. medius showed the synergistic effect with each other, so these 2 isolates were used in further experiments. These 2 isolates were involved in increasing the root-shoot length, proline and MDA contents. SEM and fluorescence microscopy were used to detect endophytic fungal colonization in the root of seedlings. C. parahalotolerant and A. medius heavily colonized the roots and it was noticed on the 21st day of the growth phase. These findings imply that fungal isolates have the potential to confer stress tolerance to their respective hosts and may enhance the agricultural production in the future, especially considering the changes in climate.",root; shoot,molecular; culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

The efficacy of the PCR-detection method for G. citricarpa was approximately 60-70% for lesions without pycnidia, and approximately 90% for lesions with pycnidia. A reliability of 99% can be reached by analysing multiple lesions per sample. An internal control was developed to monitor DNA samples for PCR inhibition; samples with PCR inhibition should be re-examined. Detection by PCR is more rapid than the current five-day incubation method prescribed by the European Union for diagnosis of black spot lesions lacking the diagnostic pycnidia. The latter method had an efficacy of 40-50%, while culturing of suspected lesions had an efficacy of 10%. Species-specific primers and ITS sequence data showed that G. citricarpa can occur as a symptomless endophyte in leaves. This shows that wild and cultivated plants occurring in citrus groves are potential carriers of this quarantine fungus. Application of the presently developed PCR method for the detection of G. citricarpa will enable citrus producing as well as importing countries to prevent further spread of this harmful organism.",lesion; leaf,molecular; culture_based,NA,NA,NA,NA

Second-instar cutworm larvae were confined to greenhouse pots containing four different tall fescue Schedonorus phoenix (Scop.) Holub cultivars. After 1 wk, larvae were recovered from the pots, weighed, and individually exposed to 20 infective juvenile nematodes. Nematode-induced mortality was monitored for 72 h after exposure. Endophyte infection levels and ergot alkaloid concentrations varied between tall fescue cultivars, but endophyte infection level was not a significant predictor of ergot alkaloid concentrations in above-ground plant tissue. Larval survival also varied between cultivars, but neither endophyte infection level nor ergot alkaloid concentration was a significant covariate. Larval susceptibility to the entomopathogenic nematode varied between cultivars at 48 and 72 h after exposure. In all but one cultivar (Plantation), cumulative mortality at 72 h decreased significantly as ergot alkaloid concentrations increased. Neither larval biomass nor endophyte infection levels in tall fescue were significant predictors of larval susceptibility to the nematode. Results show that variation in endophyte-plant associations can influence black cutworm performance and susceptibility to entomopathogenic nematodes and that susceptibility to the nematode H. bacteriophora may be partially tied to ergot alkaloid levels in the insects' food. Findings further support the assertion that black cutworm may use certain endophyte-mediated toxins, particularly ergot alkaloids, as a form of acquired chemical defense against nematode-induced septicaemia.",NA,culture_based; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Overall, the experimental work revealed significant results where, 81% of the endophytic fungal isolates exhibited biocontrol potential against atleast one or more bacterial pathogens. The endophytic fungal isolate ARW2 (Clonostachys pseudochroleucha) was found to be highly effective against Gram positive bacteria whereas N4 (Parathyridaria percutanea) and H1B (Curvularia lunata) were effective against Gram negative bacteria. 52% of the endophytic fungal isolates were found to possess strong inhibition potential against fungal pathogens. H22 (F. proliferatum) and G8 (F. equiseti) demonstrated strong inhibition potential with percent inhibition ranging from 50 to 70%. The plant growth promoting activity of endophytic fungal isolates depicted that 52%, 27% and 2% isolates were capable of siderophore production, phosphate solubilisation and HCN production respectively. A quantitative estimation of IAA production revealed that almost all the isolates were producing IAA ranging from 1.2 to 200 & mu;g/mL.

Understanding the genetic structure of pathogen populations will provide insight into the life history of pathogens, including the evolutionary processes occurring in agrosystems. Tools for estimating the possible emergence of pathogen variants with altered pathogenicity, virulence, or aggressiveness, as well as resistance to systemic fungicides, can also be developed from such data. The objective of this study was to analyze the genetic diversity and population genetics of M. musicola in the main banana-producing regions in Brazil. A total of 83 isolates collected from different banana cultivars in the Brazilian states of Bahia, Rio Grande do Norte, and Minas Gerais were evaluated using inter-simple sequence repeat markers. High variability was detected between the isolates, and 85.5% of the haplotypes were singletons in the populations. The highest source of genetic diversity (97.22%) was attributed to variations within populations. Bayesian cluster analysis revealed the presence of 2 probable ancestral groups, however, showed no relationship to population structure in terms of collection site, state of origin, or cultivar. Similarly, we detected noevidence of genetic recombination between individuals within different states, indicating that asexual cycles play a major role in M. musicola reproduction and that long-distance dispersal of the pathogen is the main factor contributing to the lack of population structure in the fungus.",NA,molecular; culture_based; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Endophytic fungi serve as an alternative source to produce withanolides, like their host plant, Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal. The present study aimed to isolate endophytic fungi capable of producing withanolides, characterization and investigation of biological activities of these molecules. The methanolic fungal crude extract of one of the fungal isolates WSE16 showed maximum withanolide production (219 mg/L). The fungal isolate WSE16 was identified as Penicillium oxalicum based on its morphological and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analysis and submitted in NCBI (accession number OR888725). The methanolic crude extract of P. oxalicum was further purified by column chromatography, and collected fractions were assessed for the presence of withanolides. Fractions F3 and F4 showed a higher content of withanolides (51.8 and 59.1 mg/L, respectively) than other fractions. Fractions F3 and F4 exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus with an IC50 of 23.52 and 17.39 mu g/ml, respectively.

In each case, the host plant uses soil nutrients and host compounds to attract endophytic fungi; yet, it is still necessary to investigate how these factors affect the distribution of sample orchids and their associates. Therefore, we assessed the diverging role of phytohormones and soil nutrients in their host distribution. The root-associated fungi were investigated using the amplicon sequencing method and evaluated the host chemical profiles/soil nutrients associated with the roots of sample species using Gas Chromatography- Mass Spectrometry and High Performance-Liquid Chromatography. Finally, we used the correlation analysis method to examine their relationship with endophytic fungi. Using soil samples that were taken, we assessed nine soil nutrients along with soil pH. Likewise, 22 phytohormones were found in the roots of sample orchids. Where, both sample orchids ( Satyrium nepalense D. Don. and Satyrium yunnanense Rolfe.) were dominated by distinct endophytic fungal families (Unclassified_k_fungi and Hygrophoraceae) independently, and they showed either positive or negative correlation with phytohormones and soil nutrients based on the distribution pattern of host orchids. The narrowly-distributed orchid was rich by soil nutrients and endophytic fungi but the broadly- distributed orchid was rich by phytohormones and poor in fungi composition in local level So, the diversity and community composition of endophytic fungi was not related to phytohormones but positively related with soil nutrients in local level. Our limited data cannot provide strong evidence but this finding may open the door for further study over the distribution of orchids and their symbionts. Finally, our results help in ecological resilience and potential biotechnological application or conservation of orchids and their symbionts.",root,molecular; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the correlation between endophytic fungi and crocin production in Crocus sativus (CS) remains underexplored. Here, we explore the relationship between endophytic fungal diversity and crocin content among different CS tissues and field sites. Specifically, we isolated endophytic fungi from five different field sites (Shanghai, Jiande, Huzhou, Anhui, and Hebei) and five different tissues (corm, scape, leaf, petal, and stigma) and analyzed fungal community diversity, richness, and evenness. We identified a total of 32 endophytic fungal taxa, assigned to 7 orders within 4 classes (Eurotiomycetes, Agaricomycetes, Dothideomycetes, and Sordariomycetes). The most dominant order was Eurotiales, and the most dominant genera were Penicillium and Talaromyces. Species richness tended to be highest in belowgrown tissues, such as corm and scape. Additionally, several fungal taxa were found to be either site- or tissue-specific. Three genera in particular were correlated with crocin content: Penicillium, Sistotrema, and Bjerkandera. Given the fact that endophytic microorganisms can both promote the production of secondary metabolites in host plants and potentially produce secondary metabolites themselves, further study is required to understand the mechanistic relationship between these and other fungal genera and crocin production.",corm; leaf; petal; stigma,culture_based; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Alternariol, cyclopiazonic acid, and the total of ergot alkaloids were detected with a frequency of 52-100% in all species studied, representing 13 genera. The rest of the substances analyzed (i.e., fusariotoxins and metabolites peculiar to micromycetes of other taxa, including ochratoxin A, citrinin, sterigmatocystin, aflatoxin B-1, mycophenolic acid, emodin, PR toxin, and roridin A) were either absent or detected less frequently in quantities close to the detection limit of the method. In a number of plants, T-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, diacetoxyscirpenol, and other minor components were detected more frequently. Patterns determining the distribution of mycotoxins in vegetative and generative organs of the bird rape (Brassica campestris L.), winter cress (Barbarea arcuata (Opiz ex J. et C.

(BnRhizoctonia) and apple was investigated. Apple rootstock plantlets (Malling 9) were grown in BnRhizoctonia inoculated and non-inoculated soil after preliminary treatment with gamma-rays. A growth assay was performed in phytotron under two soil-water content regimes: an optimal one for plant growth and another inducing periodic plant water stress. At the end of the growth test, plant growth as fresh and dry weight of biomass produced over the trial period and fungal root colonization with culture-based methodology were estimated. Relative quantification of Rhizoctonia and soil fungi DNA using specific primers was performed. Overall, BnRhizoctonia inoculation gave a mean plant growth increase which accounted for 50% as compared to non-inoculated treatments. Although root colonization frequency did not differ between inoculated and uninoculated plants, the inoculated were highly colonised by BnRhizoctonia, whilst the others were colonized by a series of ascomycetes such as Fusarium spp., Alternaria sp. which quickly recolonized soil after preliminary soil treatment with gamma-rays acting soil microbial restoration. Water stress overall reduced plant growth; however, inoculation with BnRhizoctonia reduced this negative effect by about 30%. Findings of this study indicate that BnRhizoctonia acts as growth promoter; but this beneficial effect depends on its degree of root colonization and is affected by environmental interaction.",ray; root,molecular; culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

A 2-yr field study was conducted to assess the effects of A. coenophialum infection on the yield, digestibility, and chemical composition of tall fescue. Endophyte-free (EF) and endophyte-infected (EI) plots for each of two tall fescue cultivars (Kenhy and Kentucky 31) were established in August 1985 on a Maury slit loam (fine, mixed, mesic Typic Paleudalt) soil. Dry matter yields were determined for three harvests made in 1986 and 1987. Total N, fiber composition, and in vitro rate and extent of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestion were determined on samples of first and second harvest forage. Dry matter yields were not affected by infection status and averaged 0.80 and 0.83 Mg ha-1 in 1986 and 1.69 and 1.79 Mg ha-1 in 1987 for EF and EI tall fescue, respectively. Endophyte infection status had no effect on the rate or extent of NDF digestion. Rate of NDF digestion averaged 0.056 and 0.055 h-1 for EF and EI tall fescue, respectively. Endophytic infection also had no influence on the N concentration or fiber composition of tall fescue.

Seedlings received irrigation with simulated acid rain at pH 3, with water of pH 6, or no irrigation, during and after the inoculation treatments. The severity of the symptoms caused by G. abietina, and the isolation frequency of endophytic (symptomless) G. abietina and the saprophytes, were measured 11 months after G. abietina inoculation. The isolation frequencies of the two Hormonema species increased significantly in the seedlings inoculated three times with saprophyte conidia. Irrigation treatments did not affect the saprophytes. The disease symptoms caused by G. abietina were positively correlated with tree density. Symptomless G. abietina was isolated most often from the seedlings that had received irrigation at pH 6.

(RGT) is a medicinal plant of the genus Rumex, family Polygonaceae. Our research group isolated an endophytic fungus, Plectosphaerella cucumerina (Strain J-G) from RGT, which could significantly promote host growth when co-cultured with host seedlings. In this study, we used transcriptome analysis and verification experiments to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying this growth-promoting effect. We found that, during co-culture with Strain J-G, the expression of genes encoding key enzymes in amino acid metabolism and carbohydrate synthesis and metabolism were up-regulated in RGT tissue culture seedlings, providing additional substrate and energy for plant growth. In addition, the expression of genes encoding the responser of RGT seedlings to hormones, including auxin and cytokinin, were significantly enhanced, promoting plant growth and development. Furthermore, RGT seedling defense systems were mobilized by Strain J-G; therefore, more secondary metabolites and substances involved in stress resistance were produced, ensuring normal plant growth and metabolism. The research showed Strain J-G significantly promote the accumulation of biomass and effective components of RGT, which provide basis for its application.

Two important variables are the soil quality and its bacterial/fungal community. However, the interaction of these factors is not well understood and remains problematic in producing healthy crops. Here, the effect of oak-bark compost, Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis, Trichoderma harzianum and two commercial products (FZB24 and FZB42) were investigated on tomato growth, production of metabolites and resistance under biotic stress condition (infection with Phytophthora infestans). Oak-bark compost, B. subtilis subsp. subtilis, and T. harzianum significantly enhanced plant growth and immunity when exposed to P. infestans. However, the commercial products were not as effective in promoting growth, with FZB42 having the weakest protection. Furthermore, elevated levels of anthocyanins did not correlate with enhanced plant resistance. Overall, the most effective and consistent plant protection was obtained when B. subtilis subsp. subtilis was combined with oak-bark compost. In contrast, the combination of T. harzianum and oak-bark compost resulted in increased disease severity. The use of compost in combination with bio-agents should, therefore, be evaluated carefully for a reliable and consistent tomato protection.",bark,plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA
10.3389/ffgc.2023.1179910,Liu_2023.pdf,Classification of tree symbiotic fungi based on hyperspectral imagery and hybrid convolutional neural networks,To Search,"Hyperspectral imagery and machine learning have proven to be powerful, non-invasive, and chemical-free tools for studying tree symbiotic fungi. However, traditional machine learning requires manual feature extraction (feature engineering) of spectral and spatial features of tree symbiotic fungi. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can extract self and robust features directly from the raw data. In the current study, a deep CNN architecture is proposed to recognize the isolates of dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungal in hyperspectral images. The performance of different CNN approaches (two-dimensional and three-dimensional CNNs) was compared and evaluated based on two independent datasets collected using visible-near-infrared (VNIR) and short-wave-infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral imaging systems. Moreover, the impact of different spectral pre-processing techniques was investigated. The results show that a hybrid CNN architecture (3D-2D CNN), which combines three and two-dimensional CNNs, achieved the best performance for the classification of fungal isolates on SWIR hyperspectral data compared to the same architecture on VNIR hyperspectral data. The best performance is 100% for precision, recall, and overall accuracy. The results also demonstrate that combining different pre-processing techniques on raw SWIR spectra can significantly improve the performance of the CNN models for fungal classification. The hybrid CNN approach with SWIR hyperspectral data provides an efficient method for classifying fungal isolates, which can contribute to the development of accurate and non-destructive tools for evaluating the occurrence of fungal isolates on trees. Such tools can be beneficial for both sustainable agriculture and preserving fungal diversity.",NA,culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Samples were taken from symptomatic tissue and isolations were made. The resulting isolates were identified based on DNA sequence data from the rDNA-ITS, translation elongation factor 1- and -tubulin loci. Two new species in the Botryosphaeriales, namely Neofusicoccum variabile sp. nov. and Pseudofusicoccum africanum sp. nov., were found together with an isolate of N. mangroviorum.

Historically, mutualisms have been considered to be less important than antagonisms in affecting the composition of ecological communities. In plant communities, beneficial microbes may feature as keystone mutualists in structuring community composition. Understanding the direction and magnitude of mutualist effects at the community scale may be critical for making accurate predictions on plant responses to climate change, particularly for mutualists that ameliorate climate-induced stressors. Such mitigation could shift outcomes between mutualist-enhanced species diversity and mutualist-reduced diversity, depending on whether a mutualist accelerates habitat modification or competitive exclusion by its partner species. 2. Here, we tested the relative importance and interactive effects of altered precipitation and symbiosis between an epichloid fungal endophyte and a dominant grass species for dune plant communities along the Great Lakes, USA. In 2010, we imposed field manipulations of endophyte presence in the foundation dune grass Ammophila breviligulata in combination with rainout shelters and rainfall additions. We monitored natural rates of colonization by new plant individuals over 3 years. 3. Under the current precipitation regime, endophyte symbiosis in A. breviligulata reduced colonizing plant diversity, species richness and evenness. This effect depended on the amount of precipitation, with the symbiosis having weaker effects on plant diversity under both augmented and reduced rainfall treatments. 4. Despite the overall negative effect of endophyte symbiosis on plant diversity, plant responses to the endophyte were species specific. A federally threatened forb, Cirsium pitcheri, increased in abundance when the symbiosis was present, regardless of precipitation regime. Endophyte symbiosis in A. breviligulata caused minor reductions in the abundance of other grass species; however, augmented precipitation benefited other grasses. 5. Synthesis. We show that microbial mutualisms can have strong effects on community structure in a native ecosystem and that the amount of precipitation has the potential to alter how these keystone species interactions affect community composition. Predictions on future plant community structure, for both restored and native dunes, can be improved by accounting for the presence of fungal symbionts in the foundation plant species.",scale,microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Species abundance data were collected for fungi isolated from surface sterilised root samples. Brillouin index of diversity, Twinspan and detrended correspondence analysis were applied to the community data. Quantitative ordination separated the samples by site showing that the communities differed in fields of contrasting management and this was supported by data from a microcosm experiment. Species presence and absence appeared to be affected seasonally; site differences were manifested in relative abundance. Diversity did not appear to vary by site, but a methodological explanation for this is proposed. Sterile dark septate endophytes were shown to be among the most abundant groups at all sites.

A root rot disease was observed on sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) at storage houses in different locations in South Korea during 2016-2017. The disease was characterized by circular lesions with dark and light brown concentric rings along with cavities in the inner part of the root. Seven isolates were recovered from diseased samples. Two representative isolates were cultured on potato dextrose agar and the morphology was studied. Macroconidia were cylindrical and slightly curved with blunt and rounded apical cells. The size of the macroconidia was 28.3 (15.0-44.3) x 5.8 (4.2-8.3) m. The microconidia were fusiform to ovoid, variable in size and aseptate or rarely with single septa. Microconidial size varied from 9.2 (5.2-16.1) x 3.6 (2.6-4.5) m. The fungal isolates were identified as Fusarium solani (Martius) Appel & Wollenweber emend. Snyder & Hansen on the basis of the morphological and cultural characteristics. The isolates were confirmed as F. solani on the basis of molecular identification by rDNA-ITS and translation elongation factor (EF 1-) gene sequence analysis.

This study investigates the production, purification, biochemical characterization, and potential applications of pectinase derived from the endophytic fungal strain Aspergillus sydowii EF 375, isolated from the mangrove plant Ceriops tagal. Pectinase production was optimized using Response Surface Methodology (RSM), resulting in a 2.2-fold enhancement in enzyme production. The enzyme was subsequently purified, achieving a recovery yield of 3.2% and a specific activity of 73.05 U/mg. Zymogram analysis confirmed the purified pectinase to have a molecular weight of approximately 43 kDa. Kinetic studies revealed a maximum reaction velocity (Vmax) of 161.29 mu mol/min and a Michaelis constant (Km) of 0.177 mg/ml, indicating high substrate affinity. The enzyme exhibited optimal catalytic efficiency at 50 degrees C and pH 5. The activity of the enzyme was notably enhanced by the presence of K+, Cu2(+), Fe2(+), Mg2(+), Mn2(+), Pb2(+), and Zn2(+) ions (at concentrations up to 10 mM), while Li+, Hg2(+), and Ni2(+) acted as inhibitors. Functional applications demonstrated that the purified pectinase significantly improved the clarity of fruit juices, including apple, grape, pineapple, and orange.

Seed-borne fungal pathogens are a major threat to black cumin production and cause considerable yield losses every year worldwide. The aim of this study was to identify seed-borne fungi, the effects of natural fungal infected seeds on some seed quality indicators, and also to investigate cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs), pathogenicity and aggressiveness of the isolates obtained from seeds. The constituents of essential oils (EOs) from seeds of Iranian and Syrian black cumin populations were identified and their effect on [isolated] seed-borne Fusarium isolates. A total of 17 isolates were identified based on morphological and molecular characteristics of Fusar- ium oxysporum and F. solani species. The results of the standard germination test showed that there was a significant difference between the studied seed populations in the germination and vigor indices. Our results indicated that most of the identified isolates were in the seed coat, while a few isolates of F. oxysporum were located in embryos. The results of the pathogenicity test showed that about 42% of the isolates were pathogenic and 58% of the isolates were non-pathogenic. Different levels of pathogenicity and aggressiveness were observed for various isolates of Fusarium species. All Fusarium isolates were not capable of producing CWDEs as pathogenicity factors. Analyzing the activity of CWDEs, including cellulase, pectinase, xylanase and lipase produced by the Fusarium isolates, revealed that activity levels of CWDEs are positive and are correlated with variations in pathogenicity and aggressiveness of seed-borne fungal isolates on seeds. The EOs were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and the major constituents were identified as rho-cymene, trans-anethole, thymoquinone, limonene, carvacrol and alpha-thujene. The results showed that the compounds rho-cymene, limonene, carvacrol, thymoquinone and transanethole had antifungal effects against F. oxysporum isolate. It seems that the percentage of carvacrol and limonene composition in the EOs components can affect the presence of the seed-borne Fusarium. This is the first report on the effect of EO compositions of black cumin seed populations on seed-borne Fusarium isolated from the same seeds. The findings of this research showed that the amounts and types of constituents of EOs of black cumin seed populations are different and they can affect the abundance of seed-borne fungi and their level of pathogenicity and aggressiveness.",seed; cell wall; embryo; seed coat,molecular; culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although trees are not killed, the vegetative phase of the disease impedes canopy development during vegetative phase of the host plant and floral phase dramatically reduces fruit yield with overwintering inoculums during dormant phase of the host plant. Environmental conditions and trend of spore liberation of its pathogenic fungus ""Fusarium mangiferae"" were recorded during flowering phase (Feb-April, 2014), fruit development phase (May-July, 2014), vegetative phase (Aug-Oct, 2014), and dormant phase (Nov-Jan, 2014-15), of the mango plants. Through installation of spore traps of various distance levels containing Nash-Synder media in petri plates. During these phases, different environmental variables including temperature (T), relative humidity (R.H) and wind speed (W.S) were observed. Maximum number of colonies were observed through the spores trapped from the centre of the experimental block (0m) while minimum numbers of colonies were developed from the spores trapped at 150 m distance. Amongst different phenological phases of mango, fruit development remained very much contaminated with spores of the fungus while minimum spore liberation was noted during flowering phase of mango indicating very rare infection during this phase. This study also reflected that maximum number of airborne macro conidia of F. mangiferae were recorded when R.H was below 55%. Low R.H appeared to be a major factor associated with the diurnal conidial dispersal of airborne pathogen. Hence primary infection of F. mangiferae starts from vegetative and floral buds differentiation and control strategy including spray of systemic fungicides should start at this stage of development. © 2017 Pak.

Endophytic fungi living in unique niches such as in endosymbiosis with plants are increasingly drawing attention as alternative sources of novel and chemically diverse compounds with unique mechanisms of action. Methods In the present study, ten endophytic fungi isolated from the medicinal plant, Sclerocarya birrea were screened for bioactivity against a panel of indicator bacteria. Three bioactive endophytic fungi (strains P02PL2, P02MS1, and P02MS2A) were selected and identified through ITS-rDNA sequencing. The whole broth extracts of the three selected isolates were further screened against contemporary drug-resistant bacterial pathogens. This was followed by partial purification by solid phase extraction and GC-MS analysis of bioactive fractions. Results The bioactive endophytic fungi were identified as Alternaria alternata species (strains P02PL2 and P02MS1) and Nigrospora oryzae (strain P02MS2A). The whole broth extracts from N. oryzae P02MS2A exhibited a MIC of one mu g/mL and 16 mu g/mL against gram-negative, MDR Pseudomonas 5625574 and gram-positive MRSA 25775 clinical isolates, respectively. After partial purification and GC-MS analysis of whole broth extract from A. alternaria PO2MS1, 2-fluorobenzoic acid heptadecyl was putatively identified as the active compound in fraction C of this extract. This compound was also putatively identified in fraction E of A. alternata P02PL2, fraction B of A. alternata P02MS1 and fraction B of N. oryzae P02MS2A, and interestingly, all these fractions retained activity against the two MDR clinical isolates. Conclusion The putative identification of 2-fluorobenzoic acid heptadecyl compound showing a broad-spectrum of activity, more especially against gram-negative MDR contemporary pathogens is highly encouraging in the initiative at developing novel drugs to combat multi-drug resistance.",NA,molecular; culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

The feasibility of enhancing production of an endophyte-derived beneficial alkaloid through introduction of an additional gene copy was assessed in a proof-of-concept study. Sexual and asexual Epichloe species that form symbiotic associations with cool-season grasses of the Poaceae sub-family Pooideae produce bioactive alkaloids that confer resistance to herbivory by a number of organisms. Of these, peramine is thought to be crucial for protection of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) from the Argentinian stem weevil, an economically important exotic pest in New Zealand, contributing significantly to pasture persistence. A single gene (perA) has been identified as solely responsible for peramine biosynthesis and is distributed widely across Epichloe taxa. In the present study, a functional copy of the perA gene was introduced into three recipient endophyte genomes by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. The target strains included some that do not produce peramine, and others containing different perA gene copies. Mitotically stable transformants generated from all three endophyte strains were able to produce peramine in culture and in planta at variable levels. In summary, this study provides an insight into the potential for artificial combinations of alkaloid biosynthesis in a single endophyte strain through transgenesis, as well as the possibility of using novel genome editing techniques to edit the perA gene of non-peramineproducing strains.",stem,molecular; culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Particularly in wetland plants, these associations are less understood. We analysed the role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate fungi (DSF) in the roots of Potentilla anserina (Rosaceae), an invasive species of Patagonia, widely distributed in wetlands. We tested three hypotheses: that fungi colonization varies according to soil moisture and nutrient content (nitrogen and phosphorus), that they enhance P. anserina nutrient content, and benefit plant growth. We measured the percentage of colonization in plants from five wetlands across a moisture gradient with different nutrient content, and performed a growth experiment with soil from these wetlands to evaluate changes in mycorrhizal and endophytic fungal colonization, aerial nutrient content and biomass production. In the field, root colonization by AMF was high in all sites (similar to 90%), whereas DSF was less abundant (similar to 20%), positively related to soil organic matter, and negatively related to soil phosphorus. In the experiment, DSF colonization was inversely related to increasing tissue N and P content. Potentilla anserina grew similarly in all the treatments, but biomass was positively related to DSF colonization. Our results provide evidence that DSF, rather than AMF, confer to this invasive species the ability to grow in soils with different water and nutrient content and may help to explain the wide distribution of this alien species in Patagonian wetlands.",mycorrhizal; root,microscopy; inoculation,NA,NA,NA,NA
10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.08.350,Rozek_2019.pdf,Associations of root-inhabiting fungi with herbaceous plant species o temperate forests in relation to soil chemical properties,To Search,"The overwhelming majority of research on fungal interactions with plants in the forest ecosystems of the temperate climate zone focuses on ectomycorrhizal associations and no studies so far have compared the occurrence of root-inhabiting fungi in herbaceous plant species. We thus studied arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and fungal root endophyte colonization rates as well as AMF species richness and composition under 19 herbaceous plant species in temperate forests (southeast Poland) in relation to soil chemical properties. Seventeen species formed arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM), while 2 were non-mycorrhizal. The intensity of AMF colonization varied between species. Relative mycorrhizal root length (M-AMF%) ranged from 0% to 100%. AMF spore abundance ranged from 0 to 11.4 in 1 g of soils. Sixteen AMF species were recorded, both widespread (e.g. Funneliformis constrictum, Claroideuglomus claroideum) and rare (Acaulospora cavernata, Entrophospora infrequens). The composition of AMF species related to the plants differed. Fungal root endophytes were recorded only in some plants; dark septate endophytes (DSE) in 13 species, while Olpidium spp. in 6 species. Moreover. DSE mycelia and Olpidium spp. sporangia were observed with low abundance, and their occurrence differed between particular plant species. Among soil chemical properties, only the concentration of available phosphorus was significantly negatively correlated with the M-AMF% parameter. In conclusion, several groups of root-inhabiting fungi were related to herbaceous plants; however, they occurred with varied frequency. AMF spore abundance and species richness differed as well; however, they persisted at a low level compared to other ecosystems. Nonetheless, we detected significant negative correlation between available P contents in soils and the intensity of mycorrhizal colonization, which suggests the importance of AM for the plants in sites with low P concentration.

Methods: Twenty one different endophytic fungal extracts were screened for presence of various phytochemicals, TPC and in vitro antioxidant activity. TPC was tested by Folin-Ciocalteau reagent based assay. DPPH free radical scavenging, hydrogen peroxide scavenging and reducing power assays were used to evaluate the antioxidant activity. Results: Alkaloids, phenols, flavonoids, saponins, and terpenes were the main phytochemicals presents in all 21 endophytes. A significant positive correlation was found between antioxidant activity and TPC in fungal extracts. There is 36% endophytic extracts having high phenolic content exhibited potent antioxidant activity. Chaetornium sp., Aspergillus sp., Aspergillas peyronelii and Aspergillus niger strain showed the highest antioxidant activity ranging from 50% to 80% having 58 mg/g to 60 mg/g GAE total phenolics.

Here, we compared the molecular response of Arabidopsis thaliana independently challenged with a Fusarium oxysporum endophyte Fo47 versus a pathogen Fo5176. These two F. oxysporum strains share a core genome of about 46 Mb, in addition to 1,229 and 5,415 unique accessory genes. Metatranscriptomic data reveal a shared pattern of expression for most plant genes (about 80%) in responding to both fungal inoculums at all timepoints from 12 to 96 h postinoculation (HPI). However, the distinct responding genes depict transcriptional plasticity, as the pathogenic interaction activates plant stress responses and suppresses functions related to plant growth and development, while the endophytic interaction attenuates host immunity but activates plant nitrogen assimilation. The differences in reprogramming of the plant transcriptome are most obvious in 12 HPI, the earliest timepoint sampled, and are linked to accessory genes in both fungal genomes. Collectively, our results indicate that the A. thaliana and F. oxysporum interaction displays both transcriptome conservation and plasticity in the early stages of infection, providing insights into the finetuning of gene regulation underlying plant differential responses to fungal endophytes and pathogens.",NA,molecular; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction,NA,NA,NA,NA

Among them, Stagonosporopsis oculihominis, Alternaria eichhorniae, Phyllosticta aristolochiicola, Aspergillus flavus and Fusarium lactis were the dominant genera. Further, the secondary metabolites produced by the dominant genera were screened for antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. The secondary metabolites of Stagonosporopsis oculihominis showed good inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus and the release of nitric oxide (NO). Three benzene ring derivatives were also identified using chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques, including (Z)-1- hydroxy-4-(2-nitroethenyl)-benzene (1), p-hydroxybenzaldehyde (2) and p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (3).

Zinc (Zn) is an intensively reported deficient nutrient for maize and wheat production in Brazilian Cerrado. It can be sustainably managed by inoculation with plant growth-promoting bacteria and their symbiotic association with other microorganisms such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE). The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of Azospirillum brasilense inoculation and residual Zn rates on root colonization and grain yield of maize and wheat in succession under the tropical conditions of Brazil. These experiments were conducted in a randomized block design with four replications and arranged in a 5 x 2 factorial scheme. The treatments consisted of five Zn rates (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 kg ha(-1)) applied from zinc sulfate in maize and residual on wheat and without and with seed inoculation of A. brasilense. The results indicated that root colonization by AMF and DSE in maize-wheat cropping system were significantly increased with interaction of Zn rates and inoculation treatments. Inoculation with A. brasilense at residual Zn rates of 4 kg ha(-1) increased root colonization by AMF under maize cultivation. Similarly, inoculation with A. brasilense at residual Zn rates of 2 and 4 kg ha(-1) reduced root colonization by DSE under wheat in succession. The leaf chlorophyll index and leaf Zn concentration were increased with inoculation of the A. brasilense and residual Zn rates. The inoculation did not influence AMF spore production and CO2-C in both crops. The grain yield and yield components of maize-wheat were increased with the inoculation of A. brasilense under residual Zn rates of 3 to 4 kg ha(-1) in tropical savannah conditions. Inoculation with A. brasilense under residual Zn rates up to 4 kg ha(-1) promoted root colonization by AMF and DSE in the maize cropping season. While the inoculation with A. brasilense under 2 and 4 kg ha(-1) residual Zn rates reduced root colonization by AMF and DSE in the wheat cropping season. Therefore, inoculation with A. brasilense in combination with Zn fertilization could consider a sustainable approach to increase the yield and performance of the maize-wheat cropping system in the tropical savannah conditions of Brazil.",root; mycorrhizal; seed; leaf,culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

10.1016/j.funbio.2015.07.003,Oono_2015.pdf,A comparison of the community diversity of foliar fungal endophytes between seedling and adult loblolly pines (Pinus taeda),To Search,"Fungal endophytes represent one of the most ubiquitous plant symbionts on Earth and are phylogenetically diverse. The structure and diversity of endophyte communities have been shown to depend on host taxa and climate, but there have been relatively few studies exploring endophyte communities throughout host maturity. We compared foliar fungal endophyte communities between seedlings and adult trees of loblolly pines (Pinus taeda) at the same seasons and locations by culturing and culture-independent methods. We sequenced the internal transcribed spacer region and adjacent partial large subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (ITS-LSU amplicon) to delimit operational taxonomic units and phylogenetically characterize the communities. Despite the lower infection frequency in seedlings compared to adult trees, seedling needles were receptive to a more diverse community of fungal endophytes. Culture-free method confirmed the presence of commonly cultured OTUs from adult needles but revealed several new OTUs from seedling needles that were not found with culturing methods. The two most commonly cultured OTUs in adults were rarely cultured from seedlings, suggesting that host age is correlated with a selective enrichment for specific endophytes. This shift in endophyte species dominance may be indicative of a functional change between these fungi and their loblolly pine hosts. (C) 2015 The British Mycological Society.

Yet despite rice being one of the most important cereal crops agriculturally and economically, knowledge of its microbiome, particularly core inhabitants and any functional properties bestowed is limited. In this study, the microbiome in rice seedlings derived directly from seeds was identified, characterized and compared to the microbiome of the seed. Rice seeds were sourced from two different locations in Arkansas, USA of two different rice genotypes (Katy, M202) from two different harvest years (2013, 2014). Seeds were planted in sterile media and bacterial as well as fungal communities were identified through 16S and ITS sequencing, respectively, for four seedling compartments (root surface, root endosphere, shoot surface, shoot endosphere). Overall, 966 bacterial and 280 fungal ASVs were found in seedlings. Greater abundance and diversity were detected for the microbiome associated with roots compared to shoots and with more epiphytes than endophytes. The seedling compartments were the driving factor for microbial community composition rather than other factors such as rice genotype, location and harvest year. Comparison with datasets from seeds revealed that 91 (out of 296) bacterial and 11 (out of 341) fungal ASVs were shared with seedlings with the majority being retained within root tissues. Core bacterial and fungal microbiome shared across seedling samples were identified. Core bacteria genera identified in this study such asRhizobium,Pantoea,Sphingomonas, andPaenibacillushave been reported as plant growth promoting bacteria while core fungi such as Pleosporales,AlternariaandOccultifurhave potential as biocontrol agents.",seed; root; shoot,molecular; culture_based; inoculation; bioactivity_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

This has narrowed genetic diversity, impacting traits essential for stress resilience and efficient nutrient and water acquisition-factors expected to become increasingly critical under climate change. In this study, we evaluated 36 primary synthetic (PS) hexaploid wheat lines developed by crossing Aegilops tauschii with the durum wheat cultivar Langdon (LNG) and compared them with LNG and the hexaploid variety Norin 61 (N61). We observed significant variation in root length, biomass, and associations with fungal endophytes, including beneficial Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi (AMF) and Serendipita indica, and pathogenic Alternaria sp. Clustering analysis based on these traits identified three distinct PS groups: (1) lines with greater root length and biomass, high AMF and S. indica colonization, and low Alternaria infection; (2) lines with intermediate traits; and (3) lines with reduced root traits and high Alternaria susceptibility. Notably, these phenotypic patterns corresponded closely with the soil classification of the Ae. tauschii progenitors' origin, such as Cambisols (supportive of root growth), and Gleysols and Calcisols (restrictive of root growth). This highlights the soil microenvironment as a key determinant of belowground trait expression. By comparing PS lines with domesticated tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, we identified and selected PS lines derived from diverse Ae. tauschii with enhanced root traits. Our study emphasizes the potential of wild D-genome diversity to restore critical root traits for breeding resilient wheat.",root; mycorrhizal,culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Undifilum. Swainsonine, the mycotoxin produced by the endophyte render the host plant toxic and this has been detrimental to grazing livestock in both China and U.S.A. Despite previous efforts, many questions remain to be solved, such as the transmission mode and life cycle of host–endophyte symbiont, the biosynthesis pathway of swainsonine, and in particular the ecological role and evolution of such symbiosis. In this review, we compile the literature to synthesize ideas on the diversity of the symbiosis and propagation of the endophyte. We further compare the previous work from both Alternaria sect. Undifilum and other swainsonine producing fungi to orchestrate a more comprehensive biosynthesis pathway of swainsonine. We also connect swainsonine biosynthesis pathway with that of its precursor, lysine, and link this to a potential role in modulating plant stress response. Based on this we hypothesize that this host–endophyte co-evolution originated from the needs for host plant to adapt for stress. Validation of this hypothesis will depend on future research on endophytic symbiosis in Oxytropis and help in better understanding the roles of plant–endophyte symbiosis in non-Poaceae species. © 2021 by the authors.

Its entomopathogenicity is a characteristic that was acquired during evolution from a plant endophyte ancestor. This transition provides a novel perspective on how new functional mechanisms important for host switching and virulence have evolved. From a random T-DNA insertion library, we obtained a pathogenicity defective mutant that resulted from the disruption of a sterol carrier gene (Mr-npc2a). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Metarhizium acquired Mr-npc2a from an insect by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Mr-NPC2a binds to cholesterol, an animal sterol, rather than the fungal sterol ergosterol, indicating it retains the specificity of insect NPC2 proteins. Mr-NPC2a is an intracellular protein and is exclusively expressed in the hemolymph of living insects. The disruption of Mr-npc2a reduced the amount of sterol in cell membranes of the yeast-like hyphal bodies that facilitate dispersal in the host body. These were consequently more susceptible to insect immune responses than the wild type. Transgenic expression of Mr-NPC2a increased the virulence of Beauveria bassiana, an endophytic insect-pathogenic fungus that lacks a Mr-NPC2a homolog.",root,molecular; microscopy; inoculation,NA,NA,NA,NA

Kudzu (Pueraria montana var. lobata) is a dominant, abundant, and highly aggressive invasive plant in the Southeast United States. Kudzu serves as a pathogen reservoir that impacts economically important leguminous crops. We conducted the first investigations on kudzu fungal endophytes (Illumina MiSeq-ITS2) to elucidate drivers of endophytic communities across the heart of the invasive range in the Southeast United States (TN, MS, AL, GA). We tested the impacts of multiple environmental parameters (Chlorophyll, NO3-, K+, soil pH, leaf area, host genotype, traffic intensity, and geographic location) on foliar endophyte communities. Endophytic communities were diverse and structured by many factors in our PerMANOVA analyses, but location, genotype, and traffic (proxy for pollution) were the strongest drivers of community composition (R-2 = 0.152, p < 0.001, R-2 = 0.129, p < 0.001, and R-2 = 0.126, p < 0.001, respectively).

We identify numerous OTUs that are positively and strongly associated with pathogen occurrence, largely within the families Montagnulaceae and Tremellales incertae sedis. Taken together, these data suggest location, host genetics and local pollution play instrumental roles in structuring communities, and integrative plant management must consider these factors when developing management strategies.",leaf,inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

LS-Y-1 was carried out. Five known compounds were separated from the fermentation product of LS-Y-1 by chromatographic separation techniques. Based on the results of H-1 NMR and C-13 NMR spectrometry, their structures were determined as 2,4-dimethyldodecan-1-ol (1), mannitol (2), 4-O-beta-D-gal-actopyranosyl-erythritol (3), alternariol 9-O-methyl ether (4), allantoin (5). Then, the contact toxicities and feeding deterrent activities of compounds 1-5 were evaluated, and the results of bioassays showed that 4-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-erythritol (3) exerted good feeding deterrent activities against T. castaneum. The feeding deterrence index (FDI) of 4-O-beta-D-galactopyranosyl-erythritol (3) can reach up to 84.62% when concentrations were 2 mg/mL, while contact toxicity assays showed that alternariol 9-O-methyl ether (4) exhibited most noticeable contact activity against the adults of T. castaneum (lethal dose 50 (LD50 = 38.26 mg/adult). Furthermore, mannitol (2) and 9-O-methyl ether (4) exhibited synergistic activity against T. castaneum at a 6:2 ratio. Altogether, the results demonstrated that plant endophytic fungi have great potential in the research of new anti-insect active substances and have certain research value in the green control of tradi-tional Chinese medicine pests.

WT Aiton,To Search,"Bacterial endophytes are beneficial to their hosts as they can fix nitrogen in the soil and make it available to the host. Endophytic bacteria also secrete plant growth-promoting hormones to support their host plants under normal as well as stress conditions. The current study aimed to isolate endophytic bacteria from different parts of Calotropis procera, i.e., roots, stem and leaves of Calotropis procera (Ait.) W.T. Aiton. Plants were collected from the Lundkhwar, district Mardan. A total of 12 bacterial strains, i.e., six from roots, three from the stem and three from the leaves were isolated. The strains were screened for their growth-promoting activity in rice plants because rice shows a quick and easy response to the bioactive compounds present in the culture filtrate (CF) of the potent endophytic strains. The rice plants were cultivated in pots containing 30 mL of 0.8% w/v water-agar medium. The pots were placed in a growth chamber, operated at 28 +/- 0.3 degrees C for 14 h (day); and 25 +/- 0.3 degrees C for 10 h (night), at 70% relative-humidity. Among the isolated strains, R1, S1, S3, L1, R5 and R6 showed visible growth promotion in rice plants. The biochemical analysis revealed that the strains were able to produce indole acetic acid (IAA) and flavonoids in higher quantities. Moreover, the strains also produced bioactive compounds that inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli and Aspergillus flavus using the well diffusion method. From the results, it was concluded that these strains can secrete potent compounds that can promote the host plant growth and inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms and, therefore, can be used as bio-fertilizer and bio-control agents.",root; stem; leaf,culture_based; inoculation; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

The seed-degrading potential of Fusarium isolated from the seeds was tested by inoculating seeds of E. crus-galli with spore suspension. Molecular identification of epiphytic and endophytic fungal genera was performed by sequencing the ITS region of rDNA. Endophytes comprised of significantly lower fungal richness compared to epiphytes. A significant taxonomic overlap was observed between the endosphere and seed surface. The most abundant genera were Alternaria, Fusarium, Cladosporium, and Sarocladium. Analysis of similarities and hierarchical clustering showed that microbial communities were more dissimilar between the two plant species than between the years.

Here, we comparatively examine the interactions between maize (Zea mays) and an endophytic fungal entomopathogen (Beauveria bassiana) in a typical agroecosystem under both ambient and elevated air temperatures. We found that under ambient temperature certain key biological characteristics in maize (i.e., height, relative growth rate, biomass, and defense enzymes) and B. bassiana (i.e., conidia yield, germination rate of conidia, and virulence) were positively related to each other. Under elevated air temperature, however, we only detected positive effects of maize on B. bassiana (i.e., conidia yield, germination rate of conidia, and virulence), but little effect of B. bassiana on maize. These observations suggest that elevated air temperature could shift the interactions between plants and the endophytic fungal entomopathogens, possibly even from mutualism to commensalism. Both the nature and strength of species interactions are important for better understanding and predicting structure and stability of ecological communities in agroecosystems under climate change.

10.3389/fpls.2024.1305376,Sun_2024.pdf,Identification and application of an endophytic fungus Arcopilus aureus from Panax notoginseng against crop fungal disease,To Search,"Endophytic fungi are important microbial resources for developing novel antibacterial and antifungal drugs to prevent and control crop diseases. Panax notoginseng has been used as a Chinese medicinal herb for a long time, as it has various bioactivities. However, information on endophytic fungi isolated from Panax notoginseng is rare. In this study, an endophytic fungus known as SQGX-6, which was later identified as the golden hair fungus Arcopilus aureus, was isolated from Panax notoginseng. SQGX-6 was extracted using ethyl acetate, and the active components of the fungus were identified using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). The antifungal and antioxidant activities of the extract were determined and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. SQGX-6 and its extract inhibited the growth of Corn stalk rot (Fusarium graminearum), Corn southern leaf blight (Helminthosporium maydis), and Tomato gray mold (Botrytis cinerea) in vitro. The free radical scavenging rates for 2,2-Diphenyl-1-pyridinyl hydrazide (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, 3-Ethylbenzothiazoline-6-Sulfonic Acid Radical scavenging (ABTS) activity were also downregulated by the SQGX-6 extract. In vivo, the SQGX-6 extract inhibited the mycelial growth rates of the three aforementioned fungi and downregulated malondialdehyde (MDA) content and upregulated peroxidase (POD) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) content in fruits, leading to significant reduction in damage to cherry tomatoes caused by Botrytis cinerea. UHPLC-MS was performed to identify various active substances, including Alkaloids, Azoles, Benzofurans, Coumarins, Flavonoids, Organic acids, Phenols, and plant growth regulators contained in the extract. These results suggested that the endophytic fungus SQGX-6 of Panax notoginseng and its extract have excellent antifungal and antioxidant activities, and thus, it is an important microbial resource for the developing novel drugs against plant fungal infections.",hair; leaf; pod; fruit,molecular; culture_based; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA
10.1111/jbi.14260,Rudgers_2022.pdf,Biogeography of root-associated fungi in foundation grasses of North American plains,To Search,"Aim Roots and rhizospheres host diverse microbial communities that can influence the fitness, phenotypes, and environmental tolerances of plants. Documenting the biogeography of these microbiomes can detect the potential for a changing environment to disrupt host-microbe interactions, particularly in cases where microbes buffer hosts against abiotic stressors. We evaluated whether root-associated fungi had poleward declines in diversity, tested whether fungal communities in roots shifted near host plant range edges, and determined the relative importance of environmental and host predictors of root fungal community structure. Location North American plains grasslands. Taxon Foundation grasses - Andropogon gerardii, Bouteloua dactyloides, B. eriopoda, B. gracilis, and Schizachyrium scoparium and root fungi. Methods At each of 24 sites representing three replicate 17 degrees-latitudinal gradients, we collected roots from 12 individuals per species along five transects spaced 10 m apart (40 m x 40 m grid). We used next-generation sequencing of ITS2, direct fungal culturing from roots, and microscopy to survey fungi associated with grass roots. Results Root-associated fungi did not follow the poleward declines in diversity documented for many animals and plants. Instead, host plant identity had the largest influence on fungal community structure. Edaphic factors outranked climate or host plant traits as correlates of fungal community structure; however, the relative importance of environmental predictors differed among plant species. As sampling approached host species range edges, fungal composition converged in similarity among individual plants of each grass species. Main conclusions Environmental predictors of root-associated fungi depended strongly on host plant species identity. Biogeographic patterns in fungal composition suggested a homogenizing influence of stressors at host plant range limits. Results predict that communities of non-mycorrhizal, root-associated fungi in the North American plains will be more sensitive to future changes in host plant ranges and edaphic factors than to the direct effects of climate.",root; mycorrhizal,molecular; culture_based; microscopy; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previously, we identified a griseofulvin-producing Xylaria species isolated from Vaccinium angustifolium, V. corymbosum, and Pinus strobus. Morphological and genomic analysis determined that it was a new species, described here as Xylaria ellisii. Untargeted high-resolution LC-MS metabolomic analysis of the extracted filtrates and mycelium from 15 blueberry isolates of this endophyte revealed differences in their metabolite profiles. Toxicity screening of the extracts showed that bioactivity was not linked to production of griseofulvin, indicating this species was making additional bioactive compounds. Multivariate statistical analysis of LC-MS data was used to identify key outlier features in the spectra. This allowed potentially new compounds to be targeted for isolation and characterization. This approach resulted in the discovery of eight new proline-containing cyclic nonribosomal peptides, which we have given the trivial names ellisiiamides A-H. Three of these peptides were purified and their structures elucidated by one and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1D and 2D NMR) and high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS) analysis. The remaining five new compounds were identified and annotated by high-resolution mass spectrometry. Ellisiiamide A demonstrated Gram-negative activity against Escherichia coli BW25113, which is the first reported for this scaffold.

Acephala applanata species complex (PAC) are presumed to be the most abundant root colonizing endophytes of conifers across the Northern hemisphere. To test the competitiveness of different PAC strains, PAC-free Picea abies saplings were inoculated with five different PAC strains by planting them in pre-colonized substrates. Saplings were left to grow for six weeks and then transplanted crosswise into a substrate colonized by one of the other four strains for a further two weeks. PAC were isolated and genotyped using microsatellite markers. The power of colonization, i.e. the ability of colonizing roots already colonized by another PAC strain, and the power of retention, i.e. the ability of a resident strain of not being suppressed by an invading PAC strain, were calculated for each strain in every combination. The experiment was run twice under two different climatic conditions. Our results show that PAC strains differ (1) in their ability to colonize PAC-free, non sterile roots, (2) in resistance against being suppressed by another PAC strain and (3) in their ability to invade roots already colonized by another PAC strain. In addition, both the PAC PAC and the PAC-host interactions depend on the climatic conditions. (C) 2018 British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Nuarimol and imazalil seed treatments increased emergence compared with that observed in uninoculated plots, whereas chloride fertilizers had no effect on plant emergence. Common root rot (CRR) was controlled only with fertilizers containing chloride, indicating that the chloride anion was the probable effective agent. Although most of the fungicides reduced disease ratings, only nuarimol was statistically significant in disease reduction. Significant disease control effected by chloride or naurimol use did not increase grain yield. Overall, the results suggest that healthy plants in a diseased plant population may compensate for stand reduction by an increase in other yield components.

In the present work, the antioxidant activity and phylogenetic diversity of endophytic fungi obtained from semi-arid terrestrial plants and the fungi obtained from the mangrove soil samples are investigated. The fungal isolates were identified by employing molecular characterisation and phylogenetic analysis by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. Fungi belonging to six taxonomic orders of Ascomycota associated with nine genera were identified, these being Diaporthales, Eurotiales, Hypocreales, Onygenales, Pleosporales and Xylariales. The antioxidant activity of the methanolic extracts of the fungal isolates was determined using modified 2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonicacid) (ABTS) methods.

The effects of Beauveria bassiana (Hypocreales) inoculation of grape plants on the infestation level of P. ficus, tissue nutrient contents, and growth and volatile constituents of potted grape plants were assessed. Grapevine plants were individually inoculated with a suspension of 1 x 10(8) conidia mL(-1) of B. bassiana by drenching before experimentally infesting each of them with thirty adult females of P. ficus. At four weeks post-treatment, the fungus was re-isolated from leaves of 50% of the fungus-exposed plants. However, no significant difference (p > 0.05) was observed in all the plant growth parameters measured in the fungus-treated and control plants. Plant tissue analysis revealed markedly higher contents of calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) in the leaf tissue of plants exposed to the B. bassiana relative to the control. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses showed that a significantly (X-2 = 5.1; p < 0.02) higher number of known anti-insect volatile compounds (nine) were present among fungus treated plants compared to the control plants (five). Naphthalene, which is toxic to insects and humans, was detected only in the volatiles of the fungus-exposed plants. B. bassiana did not have any significant effect on total polyphenol, alkaloid, and flavonoids. Overall, treatment with fungus did not inhibit the infestation by P. ficus.

Candelilla (Euphorbia antisyphilitica Zucc.) is a shrub that develops functionally in arid and semi-arid zones of Mexico; these conditions generate an association between the plant and the microorganisms, contributing to the production of enzymes as a defense mechanism for resistance to abiotic stress. The objective of this research was to isolate and identify endophyte fungi of candelilla and bioprospection of these endophytic fungi for enzyme production using candelilla by-products. Fungi were isolated and identified using ITS1/ITS4 sequencing. Their potency index (PI) was evaluated in producing endoglucanase, xylanase, amylase, and laccase. Fermentation was carried out at 30 degrees C for 8 days at 200 rpm, with measurements every 2 days, using candelilla by-products as substrate. All fungi exhibited higher cellulase, amylase, and laccase activities on the 2nd, 6th, and 8th day of fermentation, respectively, of fermentation. The fungus Aspergillus niger ITD-IN4.1 showed the highest amylase activity (246.84 U/mg), the genus Neurospora showed the highest cellulase activity, reaching up to 13.45 FPU/mg, and the strain Neurospora sp.

We have previously demonstrated the effectiveness of a new liquid formulation of AG3 phosphonate (Calirus 150, Bromine Compounds Ltd., Beer Sheva, Israel) in suppressing pythium damping-off of cucumbers and clubroot of bok choy and cabbage. In this study, the effectiveness of AG3 phosphonate formulation to suppress phytophthora damping-off and root rot of cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) seedlings or phytophthora blight of bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) plants was determined in a peat-based mix or sandy-loam soil artificially infested with soil inoculum of P. capsici under growth room conditions. In an infested peat-based mix, AG3 phosphonate preplanting amendment or postplanting drench treatments (0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2% a.i.) and a 10-min seed-soak treatment (10.45% a.i.) significantly increased the percentage of healthy cucumber seedlings and reduced damping-off and root rot severity. The seed-soak and 0.2% treatments were the most effective treatments that consistently suppressed damping-off and root rot of cucumber even in a peat-based mix infested with high inoculum levels of P. capsici. Disease severity on cucumber plants was also significantly less in the AG3 phosphonate treatments. The single drench applications of AG3 phosphonate (0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2% a.i.) significantly reduced the incidence and severity of phytophthora blight of bell pepper plants in an infested peat-based mix or a sandy-loam soil compared with the control plants receiving no treatment. The best control of phytophthora blight of bell pepper was achieved with the higher rate (0.2% a.i.) in both peat-based mix and soil with 90% of the plants remaining healthy compared with none in the control.

In the UK, the most important entry site for N. ditissima is leaf scar. Specific apple endophytes may contribute to cultivar resistance/tolerance to the pathogen. We assessed the relative effect of location, sampling time (season), and rootstock/scion genotype on bacterial and fungal endophyte communities in the apple leaf scar tissues of current-season extension shoots and identified Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with differential abundance between canker resistant and susceptible scions, and between rootstocks. Leaf scar tissues were sampled from two orchards at three times (10/2018, 06/2019 and 10/2019) for eight scion cultivars, each grafted onto two rootstocks, for profiling 16S and ITS rRNA regions. Endophyte composition was primarily affected by season (autumn vs. spring) and location (sites and blocks within site). There was a significant reduction in the community size in the spring, particularly for fungi, and species turnover between autumn and spring. This seasonal dynamics suggest that to protect leaf scars from N. ditissima infection in the autumn specific endophytes suppressing canker may have to be augmented annually around the leaf-fall time. Scion and rootstock genotypes had limited effects on the endophyte community. A group of resistant cultivars differed from a group of susceptible ones in the relative abundance of many bacterial and fungal OTUs, most of which had low reads numbers. Nevertheless, several OTUs with high reads numbers differed in their relative abundance between resistant and susceptible scions, including OTUs from Sphingomonas, Methylobacterium, Vishniacozyma and Rhodotorula babjevae, and warrant further investigation for their potential role in host resistance/tolerance against N. ditissima.",canker; leaf; shoot,ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

The surface-sterilized explants after staining with lactophenol cotton blue showed the presence of endophytic fungi in intercellular spaces of ground and dermal tissues. In transverse sections of leaf at 100x magnification, dense blue colonies of endophytic fungi in epidermis and mesophyll region were recorded, while sprinkled colonies were seen in vascular bundles. In transverse sections of stem at 100x magnification, dense colonies of endophytic fungi in phloem and slightly lesser in epidermal region were observed. Scattered colonies were also recorded in xylem and cortex tissues. The fungal colonies were also present in intracellular and extracellular regions of both explants. Further studies will be required to identify these fungal isolates through pure culture on PDA plates to explore their biosynthetic pathway.",leaf; stem; intercellular space; epidermis; vascular bundle; phloem; xylem; cortex; mesophyll,culture_based; microscopy,NA,NA,NA,NA

Little is currently known about the diversity of fungal populations in industrial streams. This study characterized the fungal diversity of different industrial effluents using a high-throughput sequencing approach. A total of 234617 quality filtered reads were obtained from the collected wastewater samples. Phylogenetic taxonomy revealed that resident fungal communities were classified as 6 phyla, 31 classes, 79 orders, 144 families, and 192 genera. Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the most dominant phyla whose relative abundance ranged from 23.29% to 38.31%, and 17.34% to 33.51%, respectively. Recovered operational taxonomic units (OTUs) ranged from 292 (Dixon) to 427 (Capegate). The existence of some fungal genera identified in the industrial wastewaters correlated to physicochemical variables and had the potential to play important roles in organic decomposition, pollutant degradation, and xenobiotic transformation. Meanwhile, the occurrence of unclassified fungal sequences (22.5% to 33.09%) suggests that these effluents are a potential reservoir of as-yet uncharacterized fungal species.",NA,molecular; culture_based; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

In recent field and laboratory studies, Pseudendoclonium submarinum grew normally in situ but declined in vitro. Microscopic examination showed the alga inoculum to be associated with a filamentous fungus, where the fungus grew in close association with the alga. Pseudendoclonium samples collected from Ipswich, MA during a two-year period were consistently associated with the fungus. In cultures with the fungus present, algal thalli declined and became necrotic, while the fungus produced hyphae and conidia. The fungus failed to grow in sterile algal medium in the absence of Pseudendoclonium but could be isolated and grown on standard mycological culture media. Light and scanning electron microscopy showed fungal hyphae infiltrated intercellular areas of the algal filaments but did not penetrate algal cell walls. Pathogenicity is apparently a result of the in vitro environment, and it is hypothesized that the fungus produces one or more secondary metabolites, which accumulate in culture. These metabolites produced by the fungus eventually killed algal cells. Fungal ribosomal DNA sequences were compared to Cladasporium sp. in GenBank, indicating that the fungus is Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fresenius) de Vries. Widely distributed, Cladosporium cladasporioides has been shown to be a facultative parasite, endophyte and saprophyte on terrestrial plants and some algae. The fungus has not been described in association with an ulvophyte, a green marine alga.",filament; cell wall,molecular; culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Traditionally studied in model plant species with controlled microbiota inoculation treatments, molecular plant-microbiome interactions can be functionally investigated via RNA-Seq. Complex, natural plant-microbiome studies are limited, typically focusing on microbial rRNA and omitting functional microbiome investigations, presenting a fundamental knowledge gap. Here, root and shoot meta-transcriptome analyses, in tandem with shoot elemental content and root staining, were employed to investigate transcriptome responses in the wild grass Holcus lanatus and its associated natural multi-species eukaryotic microbiome. A full factorial reciprocal soil transplant experiment was employed, using plant ecotypes from two widely contrasting natural habitats, acid bog and limestone quarry soil, to investigate naturally occurring, and ecologically meaningful, edaphically driven molecular plant-microbiome interactions. Results: Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and non-AM fungal colonization was detected in roots in both soils. Staining showed greater levels of non-AM fungi, and transcriptomics indicated a predominance of Ascomycota-annotated genes. Roots in acid bog soil were dominated by Phialocephala-annotated transcripts, a putative growth-promoting endophyte, potentially involved in N nutrition and ion homeostasis. Limestone roots in acid bog soil had greater expression of other Ascomycete genera and Oomycetes and lower expression of Phialocephala-annotated transcripts compared to acid ecotype roots, which corresponded with reduced induction of pathogen defense processes, particularly lignin biosynthesis in limestone ecotypes. Ascomycota dominated in shoots and limestone soil roots, but Phialocephala-annotated transcripts were insignificant, and no single Ascomycete genus dominated. Fusarium-annotated transcripts were the most common genus in shoots, with Colletotrichum and Rhizophagus (AM fungi) most numerous in limestone soil roots. The latter coincided with upregulation of plant genes involved in AM symbiosis initiation and AM-based P acquisition in an environment where P availability is low. Conclusions: Meta-transcriptome analyses provided novel insights into H. lanatus transcriptome responses, associated eukaryotic microbiota functions and taxonomic community composition. Significant edaphic and plant ecotype effects were identified, demonstrating that meta-transcriptome-based functional analysis is a powerful tool for the study of natural plant-microbiome interactions.",root; shoot; mycorrhizal,molecular; microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA
10.1007/s11427-017-9068-4,Zheng_2017.pdf,COP9 signalosome subunit PfCsnE regulates secondary metabolism and conidial formation in Pestalotiopsis fici,To Search,"The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is a highly conserved multiprotein complex in all eukaryotes and involved in regulation of organism development. In filamentous fungi, several lines of evidence indicate that fungal development and secondary metabolism (SM) are mediated by the fifth subunit of CSN, called CsnE. Here we uncover a connection with CsnE and conidial formation as well as SM regulation in the plant endophytic fungus Pestalotiopsis fici. A homology search of the P. fici genome with CsnE, involved in sexual development and SM in Aspergillus nidulans, identified PfCsnE. Deletion of PfcsnE resulted in a mutant that stopped conidial production, but the conidia are recovered in a PfcsnE complemented strain. This indicates that PfCsnE is required for the formation of conidia. Secondary metabolite analysis demonstrated that the Delta PfcsnE strain produced more chloroisosulochrin, less ficiolide A production in comparison to wild type (WT). Transcriptome analysis of WT and Delta PfcsnE strains indicated that PfcsnE impacts the expression levels of 8.37% of 14,797 annotated genes. Specifically, nine biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were up-regulated and three BGCs were down-regulated by PfCsnE. Our results suggest that PfCsnE plays major roles in SM regulation and conidial development in P. fici.",NA,molecular; culture_based; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Time of frond emergence in 1990 and 1991 was not significantly different between fronds in noninfected plots and fronds in infected plots. Initial P. aquilinum populations in noninfected plots were significantly higher than populations in infected plots (P = 0.01), but the fungus did not significantly reduce populations in infected plots during the study. Frequency of infected fronds increased in infected plots. In infected plots mean heights of noninfected fronds were not significantly different from infected fronds except in 1990 and 1992 (P = 0.05) at the Big Hill plot where potassium levels were limiting. Biomass from noninfected and infected plots, and biomass from noninfected and infected fronds in infected plots were not significantly different. Stipes of infected fronds were significantly thicker than stipes of noninfected fronds (P = 0.0001). Infected fronds were brittle. Brittle frond texture and fungal stromatal development were strongly correlated (r = 0.9295-0.9701). The fungus grew in and between mesophyll cells of pinnules and formed subepidermal stromata in substomatal cavities. The fungus was commonly found in the cortex of the stipe, rachises, and costae, and in vascular bundles of rhizomes. Cells not infected or adjacent to infected cells appeared normal. Macroconidia inoculated to transplanted bracken plants were not infective, but after ascospores were inoculated to fronds small necrotic lesions formed from which stromata and macroconidia developed. Infections remained localized and the systemic nature of naturally-infected bracken did not develop. Cryptomycina pteridis is compatible with its host and could be considered an endophyte of bracken. The fungus would not be an effective biocontrol agent for bracken.",cortex; vascular bundle; rhizome; lesion; stomatal; stoma; mesophyll,inoculation; bioactivity_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

The objectives were to determine whether endophytic fungi influence plastic responses of host genotypes to variable soil nutrients and whether or not endophyte infection and host genotype interact to determine the extent of this plasticity. Twelve infected genotypes were cloned into ramets: half the ramets were treated with the systemic fungicide Benomyl to reduce or eliminate the endophyte, while the other half were untreated. Ramets of each genotype were subjected to high, medium, or low levels of nutrients in the greenhouse for 11 wk. Tiller number, leaf area, and leaf mass were determined after 11 and 25 wk. The fungicide significantly reduced the level of endophyte infection. Responses to nutrient conditions in relation to fungicide treatment were genotype specific: for some genotypes, high levels of endophytic fungi appeared to reduce plasticity, while for other genotypes the endophyte had no effect. The potential for microscopic symbionts to affect phenotypic plasticity in genetically variable populations has not often been recognized. However, the clandestine effects of symbionts on the plasticity of host genotypes could impact microevolutionary processes occurring within plant populations that occupy heterogeneous environments.",leaf,molecular; culture_based; microscopy,NA,NA,NA,NA

In our study, we attempted to develop bioformulations of native, fungal endophytes of Coleus forskohlii to improve plant yield using two different carrier-based materials (talc and wheat bran). Initially, fungal endophytes (RF1, SF1, and SF2) were grown on sterilized wheat bran under solid state condition and their growth kinetics and pattern were analyzed by ergosterol content and scanning electron microscope, respectively. 10-day-grown fungal endophytic cultures were used for the development of two types of formulations (wheat bran and talc-based formulations) and tested for their efficacy on host plant, C. forskohlii under field conditions. Interestingly, application of wheat bran-based endophytic formulations significantly (p < 0.01) enhanced plant height (12-29%), number of branches (51-63%), root biomass (26-33%), photosynthetic pigments (32-101%), and forskohlii content (35-56%) compared to talc-based formulations under field conditions. Shelf life of endophytes (RF1, SF1, and SF2) in both formulations revealed spore viability in wheat bran-based formulations for 6 months storage period as compared to talc-based formulations. Overall, the present investigation envisages developing plant probiotic bioformulations of functional endophytes of C. forskohlii to enhance root biomass and in planta forskolin content.",branch; root,culture_based; microscopy,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most endophyte research has focused on agronomically important species, with less known about the ecological roles of native endophytes in native plants. In particular, whether genetic variation among endophyte symbionts affects herbivores of plant hosts remains unresolved for most native endophytes. Here, we investigate the importance of native isolates of the endophyte Epichloe elymi in affecting herbivory of the native grass host, Elymus hystrix. Experimental fungal isolate-plant genotype combinations and endophyte-free control plants were grown in a common garden and exposed to natural arthropod herbivory. Fungal isolates differed in their effects on two types of herbivory, chewing and scraping. Isolates exhibiting greater sexual reproduction were associated with greater herbivore damage than primarily asexual isolates. Endophyte infection also altered patterns of herbivory within plants, with stroma-bearing tillers experiencing up to 30% greater damage than nonstroma-bearing tillers. Results suggest that intraspecific genetic variation in endophytes, like plant genetic variation, can have important 'bottom-up' effects on herbivores in native systems.",NA,culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction,NA,NA,NA,NA

The studies were carried out in the Belarusian Polesia (Eastern Europe) in the zone of mixed coniferous-deciduous forests with a temperate continental climate. The intensity of formation of various structures of arbuscular mycorrhizae (arbuscule, vesicles, and hyphae), as well as root hairs, was determined microscopically in 19 alien and 25 native plant species collected in six different habitats. In each habitat, both alien and native plants were collected. In mycorrhizal alien plants, arbuscules were formed less frequently (28 +/- 6%) than in native plants (48 +/- 6%). Root hairs in alien species were laid more often (43 +/- 6%) than in native species (32 +/- 4%). In both native and alien plants, the mycorrhiza was more actively formed in disturbed habitats, but the interaction between the factors ""degree of naturalization"" and ""degree of habitat disturbance"" has not been established. Thus, arbuscular mycorrhizae function less effectively in alien plants of the Belarusian Polesia than in native plants.",mycorrhiza; root; hair; mycorrhizal; root hair,microscopy; plant_microbe_interaction,NA,NA,NA,NA

We show in in the present paper that clavicipitaccous fungi are associated with four different ergoline alkaloid-containing plant taxa of the family Convolvulaceae. These fungi are macroscopically visible on the adaxial surface when young leaf buds are opened or are detectable by molecular biological techniques in seeds. Detectability of the fungus correlates with the absence or presence of ergoline alkaloids within the respective plant organ. The fungi contain the gene (dmaW) responsible for the committed step in ergoline alkaloid biosynthesis.

Wheat was cultivated either from seeds coated with the spores of single pure actinobacterial endophytes of Microbispora sp. strain EN2, Streptomyces sp. strain EN27, and Nocardioides albus EN46 or from untreated seeds sown in soil with and without a commercial mixed microbial soil inoculant. The endophytic actinobacterial population within the roots of 6-week-old wheat plants was assessed by T-RFLP. Colonization of the wheat roots by the inoculated actinobacterial endophytes was detected by T-RFLP, as were 28 to 42 indigenous actinobacterial genera present in the inoculated and uninoculated plants. The presence of the commercial mixed inoculant in the soil reduced the endophytic actinobacterial diversity from 40 genera to 21 genera and reduced the detectable root colonization by approximately half. The results indicate that the addition of a nonadapted microbial inoculum to the soil disrupted the natural actinobacterial endophyte population, reducing diversity and colonization levels. This was in contrast to the addition of a single actinobacterial endophyte to the wheat plant, where the increase in colonization level could be confirmed even though the indigenous endophyte population was not adversely affected.",seed; root,molecular; culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, out of five isolates from Salacia species, two fungi Penicillium capsulatum and Aspergillus fumigatus have been evaluated and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification for their endophytic action to produce mangiferin. Mangiferin has been reported to possess protective properties, including antioxidant, antidiabetic and immunomodulatory. It has been reported that the content of mangiferin is 7-9% in Mangifera indica, and is also present in other plants like Swertia chirata, Salacia chinensis, and Hypericum aucheri. Therefore, an attempt was made to explore the biotechnological approach and regulation studies to increase the production of mangiferin in S. chinensis and S. oblonga. Endophytes were isolated, screened, and analyzed, to evaluate the mangiferin in fungal extracts in comparison with crude plant extracts. An HPLC analysis was used to determine the mangiferin content present in the fungal extract of S. chinensis stem (74.74 g/mL), followed by fungi extracts of S. oblonga root (33.75 g/mL) and S. chinensis root (30.50 g/mL), compared with the plant extracts.

This paper describes the fungal diversity of the above ground parts of a 61 year old Norway spruce tree lacking visible signs of damage or disease. The problem involved with identification of the fungi to named species was circumvented by classifying them into operational chemotaxonomic units (OCTUs) by using their combined fatty acid and sterol profiles (FAST-profiles). The variation of these units was chosen to correspond to a wit-hin-species-variation determined for several morphologically defined taxonomic species occurring on Norway spruce. Ninety-nine OCTUs were identified from 666 fungal isolates obtained. Bacteria were found only occasionally from the inner bark samples (three isolates) and from needles (five isolates). Models describing the accumulation of OCTUs against the number of samples taken were used for extrapolation of the total number of fungal OCTUs in the above ground parts of the tree. Our results suggest that an undamaged, apparently healthy Norway spruce, harbours in its above ground parts nearly two hundred fungal species. The majority were estimated to be needle epiphytes. At the large forest area scale, the species richness may be one order of magnitude higher.",bark; scale,culture_based; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Under several circumstances, the association between the grass and the fungus has been shown to be mutualistic. Here, we conducted an experiment to study the differences in seed germination and mortality between infected (E+) and endophyte-free plants (E-) at different temperatures (12 and 25°C) and water potentials (0 and -0.5 MPa). Three half-sib lines of F. rubra, each composed of E+ and E- seeds, and derived from infected plants from semiarid grasslands were used. Although the endophyte effect depended on the incubation condition, germination percentage was significantly greater for E- (52%) than for E+ seeds (41%). Seed germination was more inhibited by the low water potential (75 v. 24% for -0.5 and 0.0MPa, respectively), than by the high temperature (64 v. 35% for 25 and 12°C, respectively). However, mortality was highly dependent on the interaction between plant genotype and endophyte, and between temperature and water condition. It is remarkable that while highly dependent on the host genotype, there was a clear effect of endophyte increasing seed survival, especially in those treatments that were unfavourable for germination. For example, in the more restrictive treatment (25°C and -0.5MPa), seed survival was on average, 44 and 39% for E+ and E-, respectively. In general, the endophyte affected seed characteristics of F. rubra by reducing the percentage of germination, but simultaneously increasing seed survival. © CSIRO 2011.",seed,culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

The composition of the diverse fungal communities was shaped mainly by host identity, while abiotic factors had negligible effects. The communities associated with roots of Subularia aquatica, Isoetes echinospora and Isoetes lacustris were dominated by Ascomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Basidiomycota while Glomeromycota were infrequent and the proportion of unidentified fungal taxa was relatively high. In contrast, Lobelia dortmanna and Littorella uniflora roots associated mainly with Glomeromycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota. Chytridiomycota and unidentified fungi were rare. Glomeromycota comprised 39 phylotypes spanning nine families, with the second most abundant phylotype belonging to a yet undescribed sister lineage to the family Archaeosporaceae, repeatedly reported from aquatic environments.

10.1002/ps.8599,Qin_2025.pdf,Fungal endophytes enhanced insect resistance by improving the defenses of Achnatherum sibiricum before locust feeding,To Search,"BACKGROUNDEpichlo & euml; endophytes provide many benefits to host plants, including enhanced insect resistance. Fungal alkaloids are usually thought to be responsible for the endophyte-conferred herbivore resistance. Nonetheless, the fungal alkaloid profiles and concentrations may vary considerably among grass-endophyte systems. This indicates that apart from fungal alkaloids, additional mechanisms such as endophyte-mediated host defense are likely contributed to endophyte-grass-insect interactions. In this study, we addressed this issue by investigating the effect of Epichlo & euml; on the defense responses of Achnatherum sibiricum against locusts.RESULTSThe results showed that Epichlo & euml; endophytes increased locust resistance of A. sibiricum in both choice and non-choice feeding experiments. In no feeding groups, endophyte infection increased the content of jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET), chitinase activity, and the biosynthetic gene expression of the relevant pathways. Endophyte infection also increased the content of total phenolics and condensed tannins. These indicators were negatively correlated with leaf consumption. In locust feeding groups, endophyte infection increased trypsin inhibitor activity. Exogenous application of phytohormones further proved that JA and ET reduced the consumption of A. sibiricum by locusts.CONCLUSIONThe present study showed that endophyte-conferred host defense was mainly constitutive, that is, the defense characteristics of host plants were mainly manifested in no feeding groups. Endophyte presence enhanced locust resistance of the host by activating the JA/ET signaling pathway, elevating chitinase activity and phenolic compounds content, thereby improving the defense ability of host plants.

The orchard was sprayed with a mixture of a contact fungicide, Captan 50WP (active ingredient captan) and a systemic fungicide, Score 250 EC (active ingredient difenoconazole). The residues of fungicides in honey, pollen, and bee bread were then measured by gas chromatography. Honey had very low contamination - 0.0006 mg·kg-1 of difenoconazole and 0.009 mg·kg-1 of captan. Contamination of pollen was much higher - about 0.043 and 2.99 mg·kg-1 of difenoconazole and captan, respectively. The most contaminated was bee bread, 0.27 and 6.39 mg·kg-1 of difenoconazole and captan, respectively. This finding may be due to some chemical reactions between difenoconazole and some plant metabolites taking place in pollen and bee bread.

F. Muell. (Epacridaceae) plants collected from a field site in New South Wales, Australia. All isolates formed typical ericoid mycorrhizal structures when inoculated onto roots of Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait. (Ericaceae). Microsatellite-primed PCR fingerprints generated using the primers (GTG)(5) and (GACA)(4) indicated that considerable genetic diversity exists within the endophyte population. It was estimated that a minimum of 43 genetically distinct mycelial genets were present in the root systems of the sampled W. pungens population, with most genets confined to individual plants. Two genets, however, were present within the root systems of two adjacent plants. While most genets were represented by less than eight isolates, three genets contained up to 41 isolates, suggesting that root system colonization by some endophytic mycelia might be extensive.",root; mycorrhizal; mycorrhizal structure; mycorrhizal structures,molecular; culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

A great number of foliar endophytic fungi (FEFs) have been isolated from leaves of forest trees, and some metabolites are also isolated and characterized from the FEFs. These metabolites show strong potential to inhibit or kill insects and pathogenic fungi, especially those causing decline or damage of forest trees. In addition, FEFs can inhabit in leaf litter for a short or long period depending on endophytic species, thus they affect decomposition rate of leaf litter. Some FEFs can colonize in plant roots and promote plant growth. In the review, we provide an overview of the ecological roles of FEFs and hope the resources of FEFs can be developed and be used in forestry and agriculture to reduce use of insectcides and fungicides and in pharmacology to maintain human health.",mycorrhizal; leaf; root,culture_based; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study investigates potential adaptations of root architecture upon Metarhizium brunneum endophytism linked to improved plant growth and nutrition. Plants (Solanum tuberosum L.) were grown in the presence of M. brunneum applied either as non-formulated mycelium or as mycelium containing beads. After 35 days, fungal growth, root endophytism, plant biomass and nutrition as well as root attributes were determined. In response to endophytism promoted by bead application, plant P contents and biomass were significantly increased, while N contents and shoot allocation were also significantly increased in plants from the beads without mycelium group. Bead application resulted in a shift from fine to medium-sized roots and in an increase in the number of root forks, while root diameter, surface area and the number of root tips and crossings were independent of either bead or M. brunneum treatment. M. brunneum containing beads supported endophytism allowing for increases in plant P contents and biomass. However, root architecture was not strongly modulated by M. brunneum endophytism with N provision through bead application being more important than fungal P delivery.",root; shoot; root tip,culture_based,NA,NA,NA,NA

It promotes the growth and yield of the host plant and reduces the amount of nitrogen (N) fertilizer required for plant growth. However, the mechanisms responsible for the effects of the fungal endophyte on N use in rice are largely unknown. We conducted a hydroponic experiment to investigate the effects of P. liquidambari on N uptake and N metabolism in rice plants. Rice plants were cultivated in the presence or absence of P. liquidambari under three N levels. Under the low-N treatment, fungal infection significantly increased the biomass, and the total N, soluble protein, free amino acid, free NH4 (+), and chlorophyll contents of rice roots and shoots. The activities of nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase were increased in infected rice plants. Some genes related to N uptake (OsAMT1;1, OsAMT1;3, OsAMT2;2, OsAMT3;2, OsAMT3;3, OsNRT2;1) and N metabolism (OsNR1, OsGS1, OsGS2, OsNADH-GOGAT) were also up-regulated in infected plants under the low-N treatment. However, these effects gradually weakened as the N level increased. The colonization rate of the endophyte substantially decreased with increasing N levels. Taken together, these results suggest that low-N fertilization induces a physiological state in rice that is favorable for the P. liquidambari symbiosis. The greater extent of P. liquidambari colonization under low-N conditions stimulated the expression of several genes involved in N uptake and N metabolism in rice, thereby enhancing N utilization. These results have implications for enhancing plant growth in low-input systems at nutrient-poor sites.",root; shoot,culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction,NA,NA,NA,NA

Here, the functional characterization of two fungal Na+/H+ antiporters, SiNHA1 and SiNHX1 has been carried out to study their putative role in saline tolerance. Although their gene expression does not respond specifically to saline conditions, they could contribute, together with the previously characterized Na+ efflux systems SiENA1 and SiENA5, to relieve Na+ from the S. indica cytosol under this stressed condition. In parallel, an in-silico study has been carried out to define its complete transportome. To further investigate the repertoire of transporters expressed in free-living cells of S. indica and during plant infection under saline conditions, a comprehensive RNA-seq approach was taken. Interestingly, SiENA5 was the only gene significantly induced under free-living conditions in response to moderate salinity at all the tested time points, revealing that it is one of the main salt-responsive genes of S. indica. In addition, the symbiosis with Arabidopsis thaliana also induced SiENA5 gene expression, but significant changes were only detected after long periods of infection, indicating that the association with the plant somehow buffers and protects the fungus against the external stress. Moreover, the significant and strongest induction of the homologous gene SiENA1 occurred during symbiosis, regardless the exposure to salinity. The obtained results suggest a novel and relevant role of these two proteins during the establishment and maintenance of fungus-plant interaction.",root,plant_microbe_interaction,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, field studies on the combined impacts of natural herbivory, competition and soil fertility on root fungal symbionts are rare. We asked how mammalian herbivory, fertilization, liming and plant-plant competition affect the root colonization of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytic (DSE) fungi of the dicot herb, Solidago virgaurea. The 2-year full-factorial experiment was conducted in two contrasting habitats: non-acidic and acidic mountain tundra. We found that herbivory increased arbuscular colonization (i.e. the site of resource exchange) at fertile non-acidic sites, where vegetation was rich in species having AMF symbionts, whereas at infertile acidic sites, where plants having AMF symbiont are scarce, the response was the opposite. Herbivory of the host plant negatively affected DSE hyphal and sclerotial colonization in unfertilized plots, possibly due to reduced carbon flow from the host plant while there was no effect of herbivory in fertilized plots. DSE colonization was highest in unfertilized exclosures where soil nutrient concentrations were also lowest. Liming had a negative effect on DSE hyphal colonization, and its effect also interacted with herbivory and the habitat. Biomass removal of the neighboring plants did not affect the root colonization percent of either arbuscules or DSE. Our results show that the impacts of aboveground mammalian herbivory, soil nutrient availability and specific habitat conditions on belowground root fungal symbionts are highly dependent on each other. Arbuscule response to herbivory appeared to be regulated by specific habitat conditions possibly caused by differences in the AMF availability in the soil while DSE response was associated with availability of host-derived carbon. Our result of the relationship between herbivory and soil nutrients suggests an important role of DSE in ecosystem processes.",root; mycorrhizal,microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction,NA,NA,NA,NA

Many of these larvae are significant pests, causing damage to crops and grasslands. Damage by larvae of the greyback cane beetle (Dermolepida albohirtum), for example, can cause financial losses of up to AU$40 million annually to the Australian sugarcane industry. We review the ecology of some scarab larvae in Australasia, focusing on three subfamilies; Dynastinae. Rutelinae, and Melolonthinae, containing key pest species. Although considerable research on the control of some scarab pests has been carried out in Australasia, for some species, the basic biology and ecology remains largely unexplored. We synthesize what is known about these scarab larvae and outline key knowledge gaps to highlight future research directions with a view to improve pest management. We do this by presenting an overview of the scarab larval host plants and feeding behavior; the impacts of abiotic (temperature, moisture, and fertilization) and biotic (pathogens, natural enemies, and microbial symbionts) factors on scarab larvae and conclude with how abiotic and biotic factors can be applied in agriculture for improved pest management, suggesting future research directions. Several host plant microbial symbionts, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and endophytes, can improve plant tolerance to scarabs and reduce larval performance, which have shown promise for use in pest management. In addition to this, several microbial scarab pathogens have been isolated for commercial use in pest management with particularly promising results. The entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae caused a 50% reduction in cane beetle larvae while natural enemies such as entomopathogenic nematodes have also shown potential as a biocontrol. Key abiotic factors, such as soil water, play an important role in affecting both scarab larvae and these control agents and should therefore feature in future multi-factorial experiments. Continued research should focus on filling knowledge gaps including host plant preferences, attractive trap crops, and naturally occurring pathogens that are locally adapted, to achieve high efficacy in the field.",root; mycorrhizal,culture_based; bioactivity_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Dark septate endophytes can be symbionts of plants. In the present study, we evaluated the ability of dark septate endophytes isolates to reduce the effects of water stress in the rice varieties Nipponbare and Piaui. The experiments were performed under gnotobiotic conditions, and the water stress was induced with PEG. Four dark septate endophytes were isolated from the roots of wild rice (Oryza glumaepatula) collected from the Brazilian Amazon. Plant height as well as shoot and root fresh and dry matter were measured. Leaf protein concentrations and antioxidant enzyme activity were also estimated. The dark septate endophytes were grown in vitro in Petri dishes containing culture medium; they exhibited different levels of tolerance to salinity and water stress. The two rice varieties tested responded differently to inoculation with dark septate endophytes. Endophytes promoted rice plant growth both in the presence and in the absence of a water deficit. Decreased oxidative stress in plants in response to inoculation was observed in nearly all inoculated treatments, as indicated by the decrease in antioxidant enzyme activity. Dark septate endophytes fungi were shown to increase the tolerance of rice plants to stress caused by water deficiency. (C) 2016 Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.

Most Neotyphodium species analyzed so far are interspecific hybrids with combined or partial genomes of two or three ancestral species. In this study we characterized Neotyphodium isolates from Cinna arundinacea, a perennial cool-season grass from eastern North America. A total of 23 isolates grouping into two distinct morphotypes were obtained from five local populations of C. arundinacea. PCR amplification and cloning of translation-elongation factor 1-alpha (tefA) and beta-tubulin (tubB) genes of 10 isolates comprising both morphotypes (two isolates per location) revealed that all 10 contain two copies of tefA and tubB genes. Surprisingly phylogenetic analysis of mainly non-coding sequence from these genes revealed that both copies in each isolate were inherited from Epichloe typhina ancestors, indicating that the C. arundinacea endophytes arose through intraspecific hybridization between two E. typhina progenitors with extant relatives infecting hosts Poa nemoralis and Poa pratensis. Furthermore the tefA sequences were identical between isolates, as were tubB sequences, despite obvious morphological differences. Profiling of alkaloid biosynthetic genes from these isolates indicated the presence of the peramine biosynthetic gene (perA) and the absence of genes required for biosynthesis of lolines, and ergot alkaloids. Thus this endophyte is potentially capable of producing peramine in planta and providing protection to its host from insect pests. The absence of genes for indole-diterpenes and ergot alkaloid biosynthesis makes this endophyte a candidate for agricultural applications. Based on our phylogenetic analysis, alkaloid profiling and description of morphological characteristics, we propose the name Neotyphodium schardlii for these isolates from C. arundinacea, a new member of genus Neotyphodium and the first described to have arisen through intraspecific hybridization.",NA,molecular; culture_based; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

To determine the function of one such root-colonizing fungus, Chaetomium elatum, the infectivity and composition of inoculum containing C. elatum were varied independently of and in association with the known mutualist Glomus intraradices under two light intensities. Maximum plant benefit occurred with mixtures of both G. intraradices and C. elatum and under high light intensity. Under low light intensity and in monoculture, C. elatum functioned as a weak pathogen that was able to kill host plants. Here, maximum plant mortality was associated with the highest levels of C. elatum infectivity. When G. intraradices was present, no negative impact of C. elatum was detected. Intraspecific interactions were important in predicting sporulation rates for both fungi, whereas no interspecific fungal interactions were detected. In the presence of G. intraradices. C. elatum appears to function as a ""commensalistic associate,"" neither impacting plant growth nor sporulation bv G. intraradices. Overall, C. elatum appears to be multifunctional, serving as both a rhizoplane and rhizophere fungus, opportunistically colonizing plant roots and only becoming pathogenic when resources are severely limited and intraspecific competition is high.

The bulbus of Fritillaria unibracteata var. wabuerzsis (FUW) was officially recorded in the National Pharmacopoeia of China (2010 edition) as one of the sources of BFC because of its positive therapeutic effects and few side effects. The endophytic fungus strain 6WBY3 was isolated from the fresh bulbus of FUW that had been cultivated for six years. Based on morphological methods and the phylogenetic analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, this strain was identified as Fusarium redolens. Using color reaction analysis, high performance liquid chromatography with evaporative light scattering detection (HPLC-ELSD), and mass spectrometry (MS), it was demonstrated that F. redolens 6WBY3 could produce peimisine and imperialine-3 beta-D-glucoside, similar to its host plant. The yields of peimisine and imperialine-3 beta-D-glucoside were 16.0 mu g.I-1 and 18.8 mu g.I-1, respectively, in one week of culture. These results indicate that F. redolens 6WBY3 is a promising candidate for the large scale production of peimisine and imperialine-3 beta-D-glucoside.

Conyza blinii H. Lev is a medicinal plant that has a variety of pharmacological activities, but its study is at a standstill due to the shortage of resources. Method. This study utilized the surface sterilization method to isolate endophytic fungi, and they were preliminarily identified by morphology. Flavonoid-producing strains were screened by NaNO2-Al(NO)(3) colorimetry and further identified by the ITS sequence. Additionally, we used five antioxidant assays (DPPH, Hydroxyl radical, ABTS, FRAP and T-AOC assays) to systematically evaluate the antioxidant capacity of total flavonoids, and we also determined their antibacterial activity. Results. In this study, 21 endophytic fungi were isolated from wild Conyza blinii H. Lev for the first time. There were six flavonoid-producing strains, especially CBL11, whose total flavonoid content reached 50.78 +/- 2.4 mg/L. CBL12, CBL12-2 and CBL1-1 all exhibited excellent antioxidant activity. The effect of CBL12 was similar to that of ascorbic acid at low concentrations, and its radical scavenging rates for DPPH and ABTS were 94.56 +/- 0.29 % and 99.88 +/- 0.27%, respectively, while its IC50 values were only 0.11 +/- 0.01 mg/mL and 0.2 +/- 0.01 mg/mL. Through LC-MS, we found that CBL12 could produce many high-value flavonoids, such as 3-methoxyflavone, nobiletin, formononetin, scopoletin, and daidzein. Additionally, CBL9 had good antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Notably, we obtained the high-yield strains CBL12 and CBL9, which not only had high yields (10.64 +/- 1.01 mg/L and 10.17 +/- 0.11 mg/L, respectively) but also had excellent biological activity. Hence, the results of this study provide new ideas for endophytic fungi that can be exploited as a source of flavonoids and other medicinal components from Conyza blinii H. Lev.

Although playing essential roles in ecosystem functioning, our knowledge about the effects of multiple cropping regimes on the plant microbiome and their interactions is still limited. Here, we designed a pot experiment simulating different cropping regimes. For this purpose, wheat and faba bean plants were grown under controlled greenhouse conditions in monocultures and in two intercropping regimes: row and mixed intercropping. Bacterial and fungal communities in bulk and rhizosphere soils as well as in the roots and aerial plant parts were analyzed using large-scale metabarcoding. We detected differences in microbial richness and diversity between the cropping regimes. Generally, observed effects were attributed to differences between mixed and row intercropping or mixed intercropping and monoculture. Bacterial and fungal diversity were significantly higher in bulk soil samples of wheat and faba bean grown in mixed compared to row intercropping. Moreover, microbial communities varied between crop species and plant compartments resulting in different responses of these communities toward cropping regimes. Leaf endophytes were not affected by cropping regime but bacterial and fungal community structures in bulk and rhizosphere soil as well as fungal community structures in roots. We further recorded highly complex changes in microbial interactions. The number of negative inter-domain correlations between fungi and bacteria decreased in bulk and rhizosphere soil in intercropping regimes compared to monocultures due to beneficial effects. In addition, we observed plant species-dependent differences indicating that intra- and interspecific competition between plants had different effects on the plant species and thus on their associated microbial communities. To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating microbial communities in different plant compartments with respect to multiple cropping regimes using large-scale metabarcoding. Although a simple design simulating different cropping regimes was used, obtained results contribute to the understanding how cropping regimes affect bacterial and fungal communities and their interactions in different plant compartments.

Twenty-two Beauveria sp. isolates were simultaneously assessed for their pathogenicity and heat tolerance. The selected isolates were identified molecularly and characterized in terms of conidial germination rate, mycelial growth, conidial yield and endophytic activity. RESULTS Screening bioassays showed that the B. bassiana isolates B3, B7, B9 and B12 were the most toxic, inducing mortality equal to or slightly higher than the commercialized strain B. bassiana BNat (70.7%). Median lethal concentration (LC50) bioassays revealed that only isolate B12 had a significantly lower LC50 value (5.4 x 10(5) conidia ml(-1)) than strain BNat (5 x 10(6) conidia ml(-1)). The heat tolerance screening test (1 h of exposure to 45 degrees C) allowed us to select isolates B3, B7, B9 and B12 with germination rates of 57.5% to 80.1% after 24 h incubation at 25 degrees C, all significantly higher than strain BNat (22.1%). The germination rates of all isolates decreased significantly after 2 h of exposure to 45 degrees C, with the exception of isolate B12 which displayed the highest thermotolerance (72% germination). The four selected isolates were able to endophytically colonize cucumber leaves when applied to the foliage. Inoculation of cucumber plants with isolate B12 did not affect cucumber plant growth. However, several plant growth parameters were improved 5 weeks after root inoculation. CONCLUSION On the basis of its potent toxicity and thermotolerance, isolate B12 is a good candidate for further development as a biopesticide for use in integrated pest management strategies for aphid control.",leaf; foliage; root,culture_based; inoculation; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both species exhibited the highest mortality at the nymphal stage with an average total mortality across all endophyte treatments of 91% and 89% for D. noxia and A. lentisci respectively. Fecundity decreased significantly on all endophyte treatments with an average total reduction of 18% and 16% for D. noxia and A. lentisci respectively by comparison to non-infected plants. Overall, the bioassay proved to be a rapid method of evaluating the insecticidal activity of perennial ryegrass-endophyte symbiota on aphids (nymph mortality could be assessed in as little as 24 and 48 hours for D. noxia and A. lentisci respectively). This rapid and simple approach can be used to benchmark novel grass-endophyte symbiota on a range of aphid species that feed on leaves of plants, however we would caution that it may not be suitable for the assessment of root-feeding aphids, as this species exhibited relatively high mortality on the control as well.",leaf; root,culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

C and pH 5.5. Mycelial growth was strongly inhibited by benomyl, chloroneb and quintozene, less so by thiophanate methyl. The optimum temperature for inhibition was 25.degree. C for quintozene; the other 3 fungicides gave greatest inhibition at the lowest temperature tested (20.degree. C). Benomyl and thiophanate-methyl were most inhibitory at pH 7-8, chloroneb and quintozene at pH 5-6. In pot trials using mung bean, long melon, eggplant, common pea and sugar beet, R. solani caused maximum disease at 20.degree. C and in wet and alkaline soils. As seed treatments, benomyl and thiophanate methyl gave optimum control at 20.degree. C and pH 7.6; chloroneb and quintozene were most effective at 30.degree. C and pH 5.4. All 4 fungicides gave maximum control on plants growing in wet sandy loam. Comparisons of host effects showed that, on all the 4 hosts tested, thiophanate methyl wettable powder [w.p.] at 0.25% (0.175% a.i. [active ingredient]) gave 90% control; chloroneb w.p. at 0.3% (0.195%) a.i.) gave 80% control on mung bean and sugar beet; benomyl w.p. at 0.3% (0.15% a.i.) was satisfactory on mung bean, eggplant and sugar beet, but not on long melon; quintozene w.p. at 0.3% (0.225% a.i.) gave effective control on sugar beet only.",seed,culture_based; inoculation,NA,NA,NA,NA

Clarifying the efficacy and mechanism of endophytic fungi in improving crop resistance to pest offers the opportunity for biological control. In this study, changes in the transcriptome and defense compounds of wheat inoculated with endophytic fungal strains (i.e., YC and BB) were evaluated, and the efficacy of endophytic fungi in improving wheat resistance to Rhopalosiphum padi was studied. The results showed that the numbers of upregulated differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) in wheat plants inoculated with endophytic fungal strains YC and BB were higher than those of the downregulated DEGs, irrespective of R. padi infestation. Defense-related metabolic pathways, such as plant hormone signal transduction and secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathways were significantly enriched. Endophytic fungal strains YC and BB significantly increased jasmonic acid, DIMBOA (2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one), total flavone, and tannin contents in wheat plants (P < 0.05) but decreased salicylic acid content. Variations in the contents of defense compounds were significantly correlated with decreased feeding, development, and reproduction of R. padi fed on wheat plants inoculated with strains YC and BB (|r| = 0.68-0.91, P < 0.05). The results suggested that endophytic fungi significantly decreased the feeding efficiency and population fitness [YC: (-11.13%) - (-22.07%); BB: (-10.98%) - (-22.20%)] of R. padi by altering the phytohormone pathway and secondary metabolite biosynthesis in wheat plants. This study helps in understanding of the efficacy of endophytic fungi in improving wheat resistance to insect and will be conducive to integrated pest management.",NA,molecular; inoculation; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this work, we analyzed the composition and diversity of the culturable endophytic fungi in S. purpurea according to morphological and molecular identification. Then, we investigated the bioactivities of these fungi against plant pathogenic fungi and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACCD) deaminase activities. A total of 323 fungal isolates were first isolated from S. purpurea, and 33 fungal taxa were identified by internal transcribed spacer primers and grouped into Ascomycota. The diversity of endophytic fungi in S. purpurea was significantly higher in roots as compared to leaves. In addition, more than 40% of the endophytic fungi carried the gene encoding for the ACCD gene. The antibiosis assay demonstrated that 29, 35, 28, 37 and 34 isolates (43.9, 53.1, 42.4, 56.1, and 51.5%) were antagonistic to five plant pathogenic fungi, respectively.

Aspen genotyping showed that trees mostly originated from sexual reproduction on sites reclaimed with soil covers made of upland forest floor-mineral mix (FFMM) and lowland peat-mineral mix (PMM). In contrast, most individuals in mature and burned stands sampled as benchmarks for natural disturbances originated from vegetative reproduction. Nonetheless, aspen populations in the FFMM and PMM sites were not genetically different from those in mature and burned stands. DNA metabarcoding of bacteria and fungi in root and soil samples revealed that the diversity of the belowground microbiota associated with aspen and the relative abundance of putative symbiotic taxa in PMM were significantly lower than for FFMM and naturally disturbed sites. Despite similar aspen genetic diversity between FFMM and PMM sites, trees were not associated with the same belowground microbiota. Because the soil microbiome and more specifically the mycorrhizal communities are variable both in space and time, long-term monitoring is particularly important to better understand the ecological trajectory of these novel ecosystems.",root; mycorrhizal,molecular; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA
10.1086/597376,Faeth_2009.pdf,Asexual Fungal Symbionts Alter Reproductive Allocation and Herbivory over Time in Their Native Perennial Grass Hosts,To Search,"Although most plants harbor microbial symbionts, the temporal effects of symbionts on resource allocation and herbivore resistance of perennial hosts are unknown. Neotyphodium endophytes are asexual, vertically transmitted fungal symbionts of grasses that are thought to interact mutualistically with their hosts, mainly by deterring herbivores. To test age-specific effects of Neotyphodium infection and herbivory on resource allocation, I conducted a 4-year field experiment with four genotypes of an infected perennial native grass from which the endophyte was removed and for which herbivory and water availability were controlled. In the absence of herbivory, infection increased allocation to reproductive effort in the first two growing seasons. Infected plants also flowered earlier. Herbivory increased allocation to reproduction in the first year but much more so in infected than in uninfected plants. Infected plants also had greater herbivore loads in early stages, suggesting that infected plants are more tolerant to herbivory. Asexual fungal symbionts thus fundamentally alter host resource allocation and resistance and tolerance to herbivores over time. Increased reproductive effort in early host ontogeny should benefit the symbiont by increasing transmission but perhaps at the expense of lifetime host fitness. If so, then the conventional notion of asexual endophytes as mutualistic hostages of their hosts is incorrect.",NA,plant_microbe_interaction,NA,NA,NA,NA

This fungus has a symptomless endophytic life stage. Disease symptoms become visible when trees have been weakened by abiotic stress, usually related to warmer temperatures and drought. Currently, this disease is observed regularly in Scots pine (Pinus sylVestris) sites in parts of Europe, such as Germany, increasing dramatically in the last decade. Changes in climatic conditions will gradually increase the damage caused by this fungus, because it is favored by elevated temperature. Thus, host trees with reduced vitality due to climate change-related environmental stress are expected to be more susceptible to an outbreak of Diplodia Tip Blight disease. There is currently no established and effective method to control S. sapinea. This project aims to reveal the nature of the endophyte community of Scots pine. Utilizing the antagonistic core community of endophytes could serve as a novel tool for disease control. Results from this study provide a starting point for new solutions to improve forest health and counter S. sapinea disease outbreaks. We screened potential antagonistic endophytes against S. sapinea and infected Scots pine seedlings with the most common endophytes and S. sapinea alone and combination. The host was stressed by limiting access to water. The antagonism study revealed 13 possible fungi with the ability to inhibit the growth of S. sapinea in vitro, for example Sydowia polyspora. None of the tested co-infected fungi (Desmazierella acicola, Didymellaceae sp., Microsphaeropsis olivacea, Sydowia polyspora, and Truncatella conorum-piceae) showed strong necrosis development in vivo, even when host stress increased due to drought. However, the infection experiment demonstrated that drought conditions enhance the effect of the disease outbreak, triggering S. sapinea to cause more necrosis in the infected twigs.",twig,plant_microbe_interaction,NA,NA,NA,NA

The C:N hypothesis predicts that carbon or nitrogen constrains plant secondary metabolite production, but it does not consider compounds produced by plant symbionts. Locoweeds are legumes that can have fungal endophyte alkaloid (swainsonine [SWA]) production, which causes livestock poisoning. We studied four locoweed taxa to test whether average SWA concentrations influenced SWA positive dose responses to N fertilizer. Methods: We measured locoweed leaf SWA, pigment concentrations and photosynthetic activity, and plant biomass dose responses to N supplementation for 3 mo in two greenhouse experiments. Key Results: Leaf photosynthesis, leaf pigment concentrations, and plant biomass had positive, unsaturated dose responses across tested N doses. Although N enhanced primary growth, two moderate-SWA taxa (Astragalus mollissimus var. bigelovii and Oxytropis sericea) had negative SWA dose responses to increasing N, the high-SWA taxon (A. moll. var. mollissimus) had no SWA change, and the very low-SWA taxon (A. moll. var. matthewsii) had a transient positive dose response. Conclusions: Supplemented N led to positive dose responses for plant biomass and leaf photosynthesis and pigments, but SWA dose responses differed across locoweed taxa and time. At N levels that enhanced plant growth and reduced antioxidant protective systems, fungal endophyte alkaloid production was not strongly influenced. Production of SWA may be more strongly influenced by factors other than C:N supply (e.g., seasonality, plant age) in the locoweed-endophyte-Rhizobium complex.",leaf,plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Unlike pathogenic fungi, endophytic fungi enhance the growth of host plants through different mechanisms. Studying the genetic diversity of endophytic fungi can provide insights into their co- evolution with plants. In this research, the genetic diversity of A. alternata from different hosts was examined using ten pairs of ISSR primers. Seven of the ten primers generated scorable polymorphic bands (total of 65 bands with an average of 9.2 bands per primer) for molecular analysis. Genetic diversity parameters revealed that isolates from Gundelia tournefortii exhibited the highest genetic diversity (Na, Ne, I, and He values of 1.55, 1.45, 0.35, and 0.24, respectively), while isolates from Tamarix ramosissima showed lower diversity (Na, Ne, I, and He values of 1.18, 1.13, 0.11, and 0.07, respectively). Cluster analysis grouped the isolates into four clusters based on Jaccard similarity matrix and UPGMA method. Principal coordinate analysis (PCOA) supported the cluster analysis findings. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated a high level of genetic differentiation within populations (72 %), with only 28 % of diversity between populations. The genetic structure assessment revealed a relatively strong genetic structure among populations, suggesting the presence of a hidden sexual cycle or mitotic recombination as factors contributing to the high genetic differentiation among A. alternata populations.",NA,molecular; culture_based; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

It has been well established that seed-borne microbes can establish themselves in various plant parts and provide a range of benefits to their host plants. Previous studies have characterized the seed microbiomes of several agricultural crops, but the seed microbiomes of grassland species are still poorly defined. The aim of this study was to characterize the seed microbiomes of eight grassland species that are dominant among the alpine meadow grasslands of the Qinghai Tibetan Plateau (QTP) using Illumina MiSeq DNA sequencing. The results showed a diverse consortia of bacteria and fungi (115 bacterial genera and 135 fungal genera) that thrive inside the seeds of eight grassland species. The bacterial and fungal communities inside the seeds were significantly different among the eight grassland species. The dominant seed bacterial and fungal phyla of the eight grassland species were Proteobacteria and Ascomycota, respectively. The bacterial genera Pseudomonas, Pantoea, and Ochrobactrum, and the fungal genera Botrytis, Bullera, and Didymella were found in the seeds of all eight grassland species. There were also bacterial and fungal genera unique to each of the seeds of the eight grassland species. This study showed that plant identity is an important factor shaping the seed microbiome. Some of the microbes identified in this study have been previously identified as being beneficial to their host plants, hence the results of this study can be used for future studies on seed microbiome manipulations to ensure healthy and productive grasslands. © 2020 Editorial Office of Pratacultural Science.

We determined the dry matter (DM) and important nutritional indicators of E+ (infected by endophyte) and E- (not infected by endophyte) Festuca sinensis under the three-time repeated cutting. The results indicated that the total nitrogen, total phosphorus, crude protein (CP), crude fat (CF), crude ash (CA) contents, and DM of F. sinensis decreased with the repeated cutting increase and reached the minimum after the third time cut. The total organic carbon content of F. sinensis peaked at the second time cut. In addition, the DM of F. sinensis was significant (P < 0.05) positively correlated with its quality CP, CF, and CA contents, and the appropriate repeated cutting times of F. sinensis was 1-2 times. We concluded that the presence of endophyte and proper cutting frequency can increase the quality and biomass of F. sinensis in Western China.",NA,ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Blood vessel is known to perform a crucial role in development of tumor. Blocking of angiogenesis through the control over the action of the cytokine VEGF could be possible mechanism in cancer therapy. This is very important mechanism used to prevent the proliferation of blood vessels towards growth of tumors. It has proved to be potentially attractive approach in case of controlling dreadful disease like Cancer .Knowing the importance of this process, for the first time,the study was aimed to investigate the antiangiogenic potential of endophytic fungi from the medicinal plant Lawsonia inermis linn. We successfully isolated Alternaria alternate from the leaves of Lawsonia inermis Linn and identified microscopically as well as by 18srRNA and ITS sequence analysis. The GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of wide range of bioactive secondary metabolites showing significant antimicrobial property against four human bacterial pathogens .The ethyl acetate extract of Alternaria alternata showed maximum zone of inhibiton of 21.8 +/- 0.8mm against Pseudomonas aeroginosa.

The presence of Epichloe endophyte increased the Shannon and decreased Simpson diversity of bacterial and fungal communities. Sphingomonas and Hymenobacter bacteria and Filobasidium and Mycosphaerella fungi were growing largely epiphytically, whereas Methylobacterium, Escherichia-Shigella, and the fungus Blumeria were mostly found within leaves with the location of colonization influenced by the Epichloe endophyte.

However, our previous published work on this subject remains incomplete. Here, we performed a soil nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) transformation with related functional genes and elucidated how rhizosphere microbiota vary their response to P. liquidambari interaction throughout the plant's life cycle under field conditions by Illumina Miseq sequencing platforms in a nutrient-limited paddy soil. Our results showed that P. liquidambari symbiosis decreased the nitrogen and phosphorus loss by 24.59% and 17.46% per pot, respectively. Additionally, we suggest that the application of P. liquidambari altered the activation of soil nitrogen and phosphorus functional genes to accelerate nutrient turnover in the rice rhizosphere. High-throughput sequencing with co-occurrence network and species-related network analysis further revealed that P. liquidambari colonization influenced the patterns of microbiota shift in the rhizosphere, especially during the heading stages. This led to an optimized microbial community through the promotion and inhibition of indigenous soil microbes with a higher level of available nutrient supplies.

Research suggests that the specific subset is determined by plant genotype, environment, dispersal of locally available endophytes, and mycorrhizal associates. But, interactions among members of the endophyte community could also be important. In a sampling of 63 sites throughout the invaded range of B. tectorum, a fungivorous nematode, Paraphelenchus acontioides, and an endophyte, Fusarium cf. torulosum, were found together in two sites. This positive co-occurrence in the field led to an experimental investigation of their interaction and its effects on relative abundances within the endophyte community. In greenhouse and laboratory experiments, we determined first that P. acontioides preferred F. cf. torulosum to other endophytes, and secondly that the relative abundance of F. cf. torulosum within the endophyte community was increased by the nematode in experimental plants. Taken together our results suggest that the fungivorous P. acontioides uses living plants to cultivate or increase the relative abundance of its preferred fungus. Surprisingly, host plant growth was unaffected by this endophytic, cultivation-based mutualism between a nematode and a fungus. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.

Hence, we aimed to identify different endophytic fungal species from different parts of the plants and their bioactive compounds. Objective: The study includes identification and characterization of bioactive compounds in the extracts of endophytic fungal species of Calophyllum tomentosum. Methods: Different parts were used to assess the different endophytic fungi. Two different solvents were used: extracts and qualitative solvents. TLC and GC -MS were employed to identify the bioactive compounds. The bioactive compounds producing endophytes were identified by usingl 8S rRNA. Results: In total, 13 different fungal species were identified from different parts of the Calophyllum tomentosum. The C. tomentosum leaf part showed seven different fungal endophytes from the barks (four) and stems (two). The methanol extract of Fusarium species (stem), Cladosporium species (bark) and hexane extract of Alternaria species (bark) showed a higher amount of coumarins in qualitative methods and TLC. Based on the above results, for further GC -MS and molecular identification studies, we selected three endophytes. In the GC -MS analysis, the methanol extract of Fusarium species (stem) showed psoralen, and furocoumarin (imperatonin or ammidin); Cladosporium species (bark) showed coumarin (2H-1-benzopyran-2-one), coumaric acid (3-benzofurancarboxylic acid), hynecromone (coumarin 4), 4-hydroxy-9-(3 -methy1-2-butyl)furo(3,2-g)chloronen-7one; and hexane extract of Alternaria species (bark) showed coumaric acid (3-benzofurancarboxylic acid). The three fungal endophytes were identified as Fusarium equiseti, Cladosporium uredinicola and Alternaria alternata from 18S rRNA analysis. Conclusion: Based on the above results, the three endophytic fungal species confirm the presence of coumarins and therefore, can be used for the production of coumarins instead of the plant.",leaf; stem; bark,molecular; culture_based; physiological_assays; surface_sterilization,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study assessed the diversity of bacterial endophytes in King chilli, focusing on their biocontrol potential and plant growth-promoting (PGP) activities. The survey was carried out in King chilli-growing regions and identified anthracnose and fruit rot diseases as significant contributors to economic yield loss. A total of 20 bacterial endophytic isolates were obtained using the sterility check method and identified as Pseudomonas through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In in-vitro studies, isolates P. fluorescens KEB15, P. putida KEB5, and P. putida KEB7 exhibited notable mycelial growth inhibition rates of 66.67 %, 69.26 %, and 66.30 % against Pythium, Fusarium, and Colletotrichum, respectively. Of the 20 isolates, 5, 16, and 17 isolates demonstrated positive production of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), ammonia (NH3), and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), respectively. The efficacy of crude antibiotics from the best-performing antagonistic endophytes was tested against the linear growth of Fusarium, with KEB11 showing the largest inhibition area of 35.14 mm. Sequence analysis using the maximum likelihood method revealed close relationships among the potent Pseudomonas isolates, identifying KEB5 and KEB7 as P. putida and KEB15 as P. fluorescens. Field evaluations indicated that KEB7 was most effective in controlling bacterial wilt, anthracnose, and dieback diseases, achieving a maximum plant height of 85.10 cm and a yield of 3683.67 kg/ha.

Methods and ResultsFungal endophytes were isolated from flowers, leaves and roots of Rhoeo spathacea, revealing a community consisting of Colletotrichum sp., Fusarium sp., Guignardia sp., Phomopsis sp., Phoma sp. and Microdochium sp. Genetic screening showed that all isolates had polyketide synthase (PKS) genes and most had nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) genes. Ethyl acetate extracts of the fungal isolates exhibited antiproliferative activity against at least one of the seven bacterial and mycobacterial test strains. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance -guided fractionation of the crude extract from a Fusarium sp. strain which exhibited strong antiproliferative activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis resulted in the isolation of the polyketide javanicin. This compound was active against Myco.tuberculosis (MIC=25gml(-1)) and Mycobacterium phlei (MIC=50gml(-1)). ConclusionsThe medicinal plant R.spathacea hosts a variety of fungal endophytes capable of producing antibacterial and antimycobacterial compounds.

It is desirable to explore the species composition, diversity and tissue specificity of endophytic fungi that inhabit in different tissues of medicinal plants. In this study, a culture-independent survey of fungal diversity in the rhizosphere, leaves, stems and roots of a toxic medicinal plant, Stellera chamaejasme L., was conducted by sequence analysis of clone libraries of the partial internal transcribed spacer region. Altogether, 145 fungal OTUs (operational taxonomic units), represented by 464 sequences, were found in four samples, of these 109 OTUs (75.2 %) belonging to Ascomycota, 20 (13.8 %) to Basidiomycota, 14 (9.7 %) to Zygomycota, 1 (0.7 %) to Chytridiomycota, and 1 (0.7 %) to Glomeromycota. The richness and diversity of fungal communities were strongly influenced by plant tissue environments, and the roots are associated with a surprisingly rich endophyte community. The endophyte assemblages associated with S. chamaejasme were strongly shaped by plant tissue environments, and exhibited a certain degree of tissue specificity. Our results suggested that a wide variety of fungal assemblages inhabit in S. chamaejasme, and plant tissue environments conspicuously influence endophyte community structure.",leaf; stem; root,molecular; culture_based; inoculation; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

We aimed to verify the presence of endophytic and epiphytic fungi at each stage of the reproductive process and investigated how the breeding system may relate to genetic structure and diversity of populations. In this study we performed anatomical and ultrastructural analyses of the reproductive organs, field tests to confirm the breeding system, and molecular analysis to assess genetic diversity and structure of populations. Results During the development of the pollen grain, embryo sac and embryogenesis, no fungal infestation was observed. The presence of endophytic fungal hyphae was observed just within floral stems and indehiscent fruit. Beyond assuring the presence of fungus that promote seed germination, specific fungi hyphae in the fruit may affect other process, such as fruit ripening. As other mycoheterotrophic orchids, P. schenckii is autogamous, which may explain the low genetic diversity and high genetic structure in populations. Conclusions We discuss an interesting interaction: fungal hyphae in the indehiscent fruit. These fungal hyphae seem to play different roles inside fruit tissues, such as acting in the fruit maturation process and increasing the proximity between fungi and plant seeds even before dispersion occurs. As other mycoheterotrophic orchids, P. schenckii is autogamous, which may explain the low genetic diversity and high genetic structure in populations. Altogether, our findings provide important novel information about the mechanisms shaping ecology and evolution of fragmented populations of mycoheterotrophic plant.",pollen grain; embryo; stem; fruit; seed; fruit tissue; fruit tissues,plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Twenty-nine endophytic fungi were isolated from the stem and root parts of Bryophyllum pinnatum. Based on the presence of phytoconstituents, 16 endophytic isolates were tested for the inhibition of & alpha;-amylase enzyme and free radicals. Thirteen isolates showed significant inhibition of & alpha;-amylase enzyme (18.8 & PLUSMN; 0.8 to 62.5 & PLUSMN; 0.4%) and free radicals (15.3 & PLUSMN; 0.2 to 87.4 & PLUSMN; 0.8%). Good inhibitions were found in six isolates, which was further tested to validates its anti-diabetic activity by glucose uptake in yeast cell and glucose diffusion inhibition studies. The most active isolates were identified as Daldinia eschscholtzii (BPS17) and Phomopsis mangiferae (BPK9) by microscopic and molecular identification method. Identified fungal isolates were tested for glucose uptake using 3T3 cell lines (100 & mu;g/mL) and the result showed effective glucose utilization.

Therefore, the establishment of a mutualism with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi can increase the plant's reproductive success. Acaena elongata is a native weed and a plant species indicator of anthropogenic perturbations in the understory of Abies religiosa forests of the Magdalena river basin in Mexico City. The aim of this work was to assess whether: i) there are temporal and spatial variations in AM fungal root colonization in A. elongata, ii) AM fungal root colonization is linked to A. elongata flower and fruit production patterns, and iii) AM fungal root colonization, spore abundance and richness, and A. elongata reproductive phenology are related to soil variables. Eight plots were established with five randomly selected individuals of A. elongata. Over the course of 1 year, the A. elongata reproductive phenology, environmental temperature, and relative soil moisture were registered monthly. Additionally, root samplings for AM fungal colonization and soil for determining the AM fungal spore abundance and richness were carried out during the rainy and dry seasons. The mean total AM fungal root colonization percentage was higher in the dry season (78 +/- S.E. 11.09%) than in the rainy season (71 +/- S.E. 13.2%); A. elongata showed reproductive structures throughout the year, with negative significant correlations between colonization and some phenological phases during the rainy season. Flower and fruit production as well as AM fungal root colonization were related to variations in the abiotic variables in each season and population. This study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between AM fungi and a plant species indicator of anthropogenic perturbations.",flower; fruit; mycorrhizal; root,microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Traditionally, the milpa system does not require the application of chemicals, and so pest attacks and poor growth in poor soils can have adverse effects on its production. Therefore, the application of bioinoculants could be a strategy for improving crop growth and health; however, the effect of external inoculant agents on the endemic microbiota associated with corn has not been extensively studied. Here, the objective of this work was to fertilize a maize crop under a milpa agrosystem with the PGPR Pseudomonas fluorescens UM270, evaluating its impact on the diversity of the rhizosphere (rhizobiome) and root endophytic (root endobiome) microbiomes of maize plants. The endobiome of maize roots was evaluated by 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) sequencing, and the rhizobiome was assessed by metagenomic sequencing upon inoculation with the strain UM270. The results showed that UM270 inoculation of the rhizosphere of P. fluorescens UM270 did not increase alpha diversity in either the monoculture or milpa, but it did alter the endophytic microbiome of maize plant roots by stimulating the presence of bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of the genera Burkholderia and Pseudomonas (in a monoculture), whereas, in the milpa system, the PGPR stimulated greater endophytic diversity and the presence of genera such as Burkholderia, Variovorax, and N-fixing rhizobia genera, including Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, and Bradyrhizobium. No clear association was found between fungal diversity and the presence of strain UM270, but beneficial fungi, such as Rizophagus irregularis and Exophiala pisciphila, were detected in the Milpa system. In addition, network analysis revealed unique interactions with species such as Stenotrophomonas sp., Burkholderia xenovorans, and Sphingobium yanoikuyae, which could potentially play beneficial roles in the plant. Finally, the UM270 strain does not seem to have a strong impact on the microbial diversity of the rhizosphere, but it does have a strong impact on some functions, such as trehalose synthesis, ammonium assimilation, and polyamine metabolism. The inoculation of UM270 biofertilizer in maize plants modifies the rhizo- and endophytic microbiomes with a high potential for stimulating plant growth and health in agroecological crop models.",root,molecular; culture_based; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Wilson by Modulating Root Morphology, Ultrastructure, and the Ratio of Root Hormones",To Search,"Dark septate endophytes (DSEs) are known to help host plants survive drought stress; however, how DSEs enhance host plant drought resistance under water stress conditions remains unclear. The objective of this study was to inoculate Ormosia hosiei seedlings with a DSE strain (Acrocalymma vagum) to investigate the effects of DSE inoculation on root morphology, ultrastructure, and the endogenous hormone content under drought stress conditions and to elucidate the drought resistance mechanism involved in the DSE-host-plant association. The inoculated seedlings were grown under three different soil water conditions (well watered-75% field water capacity, moderate water-55% field water capacity, or low water-35% field water capacity) for 114 days. Fresh root weight, root volume, root surface area, root fork, and root tip number were significantly higher in inoculated seedlings than in noninoculated seedlings. Furthermore, the root architecture of the inoculated seedlings changed from herringbone branching to dichotomous branching. Mitochondria and other organelles in root cells of inoculated seedlings remained largely undamaged under water stress, whereas organelles in root cells of noninoculated seedlings were severely damaged. The abscisic acid (ABA) and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) content and IAA/ABA ratio of inoculated seedlings were significantly higher than those of noninoculated seedlings, whereas the content of gibberellic acid (GA) and the ratios of GA/ABA, zeatin riboside (ZR)/ABA, and ZR/IAA in inoculated seedlings were lower than those of noninoculated seedlings. DSE inoculation could help plants adapt to a drought stress environment by altering root morphology, reducing ultrastructural damage, and influencing the balance of endogenous hormones, which could be of great significance for the cultivation and preservation of the O. hosiei tree.",root; root tip,culture_based; inoculation,NA,NA,NA,NA

The oil-bearing seeds exhibited rich fungal diversity. High Shannon-Index H' was observed with pongamia seeds (2.847) while a low Index occurred for coconut kernel-associated mycoflora (1.018). Maximum Colonization Frequency (%) was observed for Lasiodiplodia theobromae (176). Dominance Index (expressed in terms of the Simpson's Index D) was high (0.581) for coconut kernel-associated fungi, and low for pongamia seed-borne fungi. Species Richness (Chao) of the fungal isolates was high (47.09) in the case of neem seeds, and low (16.6) for peanut seeds. All 1279 fungal isolates were screened for lipolytic activity employing a zymogram method using Tween-20 in agar. Forty isolates showed strong lipolytic activity, and were morphologically identified as belonging to 19 taxa (Alternaria, Aspergillus, Chalaropsis, Cladosporium, Colletotrichum, Curvularia, Drechslera, Fusarium, Lasiodiplodia, Mucor, Penicillium, Pestalotiopsis, Phoma, Phomopsis, Phyllosticta, Rhizopus, Sclerotinia, Stachybotrys and Trichoderma). These isolates also exhibited amylolytic, proteolytic and cellulolytic activities. Five fungal isolates (Aspergillus niger, Chalaropsis thielavioides, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Lasiodiplodia theobromae and Phoma glomerata) exhibited highest lipase activities, and the best producer was Lasiodiplodia theobromae (108 U/mL), which was characterized by genomic sequence analysis of the ITS region of 18S rDNA.",seed,molecular; culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this forum, we call attention to another equally important, but overlooked mechanism to maintain variation in the frequency of symbioses in nature: the rate of vertical transmission. On ecological time scales, vertical transmission can affect the equilibrium frequencies of symbionts in host populations, with potential consequences for population and community dynamics. In addition, vertical transmission has the potential to influence the evolution of symbiosis, by affecting the probability of fixation of symbiosis (and therefore the evolution of complexity) and by allowing hosts to sanction against costly symbionts. Here we use grass-epichloae symbioses as a model system to explore the causes and consequences of variation in vertical transmission rates. We identify critical points for symbiont transmission that emerge from considering the host growth cycle devoted to reproduction (asexual vs sexual) and the host capability to maintain homeostasis. We also use information on the process of transmission to predict the environmental factors that would most likely affect transmission rates. Altogether, we aim to highlight the vertical transmission rate as an important process for understanding the ecology and evolution of symbiosis, using grass-epichloae interactions as a case study.",scale,molecular; microscopy; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

The enormous biological diversity and the capability of producing bioactive secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, terpenoids, and polyketides have attracted the attention of different scientific communities, resulting in numerous investigations on these fungal endophytes. During our surveys of plant-root-based fungi in the mountain areas of Qingzhen, Guizhou Province, several isolates of endophytic fungi were identified. In this study, a novel endophytic fungus was discovered in the roots of a medicinal plant (Orixa japonica) in Southern China and introduced as a new species (Amphisphaeria orixae) based on morphological evidence and molecular phylogenetic analysis (combined ITS and LSU sequence data). To the best of our knowledge, A. orixae is the first reported endophyte as well as the first hyphomycetous asexual morph in Amphisphaeria. A new isocoumarin, (R)-4,6,8-trihydroxy-5-methylisochroman-1-one (1), and 12 known compounds (2-13) were isolated from the rice fermentation products of this fungus.

This study aimed to assess the antimalarial activity of the endophytic fungus derived from red ginger Zingiber officinale against Plasmodium berghei. Subsequently, the endophytic fungus was isolated from the sample using the dilution method, followed by evaporation. Nine isolates of endophytic fungi were successfully isolated that were assigned as JMR1, JMR2, JMR3, JMR5, JMB1, JMB2, JMB3, JMD1, and JMD2. The antimalarial efficacy showed that the JMR5 isolate exhibited significant activity in suppressing the proliferation of P. berghei. This activity was quantified by a per cent inhibition of 83.01% and an IC50value of 5.81 mu g/mL. The detected antimalarial activity of the JMR5 extract can be related to the presence of several phytochemicals, including alkaloids, flavonoids, and terpenoids. In addition, molecular identification was conducted using ITS primers on the JMR5 isolate, showing a complete genetic similarity of 100% withAspergillus flavus. GNPS analysis was conducted using LCMS-MS data on ethyl acetate extract. Surafactin c, surafactin c14 and erucamide were probably secondary metabolites in the JMR5 extract. Furthermore, drug-likeness and molecular docking analysis were conducted. The result showed that erucamide is a potential antimalarial due to the fulfil of Lipinski's rule of five and also the binding affinity (- 4.2 kcal/mol) against Plasmepsin I. Based on the results obtained, the development of secondary metabolites from Aspergillus flavus JMR5 as potential antimalarial compounds is important to carry out.",proliferation,molecular; culture_based; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Information on some of its actual effects on banana plants and pests has been scarce. A study was conducted to assess the effects of F. oxysporum V5w2 and mulch on R. similis and banana plants in the field. The experiment was a 3-factor (2 x 2 x 2) complete randomized block design with or without F. oxysporum V5w2, R. similis or mulch. Root damage was higher when plants were inoculated with R. similis compared to non inoculated plants, while plant height, leaf size, bunch size and banana yields were lower in R. similis-inoculated plants. Plant growth and bunch size were greater in mulched than in non-mulched plots, with banana yields on mulched plots increasing by 131% to reach 37 tonnes per hectare. F. oxysporum V5w2-inoculated plants were shorter, with fewer leaves that were smaller, and had shorter duration to harvest than non-inoculated ones. When R. similis-inoculated mulched plants received F. oxysporum V5w2 inoculum, plant toppling over occurred less frequently compared to plants that were not inoculated with the fungus, probably because the plants were smaller in size during growth. The benefits of mulching in banana production were evident, while the claimed enhancing effect of inoculating tissue culture plants with F. oxysporum V5w2 as a biological control agent could not be verified. I conclude by suggesting that, the use of F. oxysporum V5w2 as a biological control agent of R. similis and other pests should be reconsidered, because this fungal strain has the potential of invading xylem vessels and becoming pathogenic to banana plants.

Soils were used in a fresh state to maintain indigenous mycofloras and seedlings were raised from several seed-lots to include possible ecotypic variation. Infection (incidence and intensity) of both ''immature'' and ''mature'' mycorrhizas was estimated. Most plants were mycorrhizal, ectomycorrhizas occurring on Betula and vesicular-abuscular (VA) endophytes in Acer. Differences in the degree of infection between soils, but not between seed-lots, were highly significant. Infection of one or both species was highly correlated with several soil factors (pH, organic matter, phosphorus and iron), and with all the plant variables. In Betula, evidence for most of these relationships was obtained only from ''immature'' mycorrhizas, suggesting early physiological activity. Mycorrhizas accounted for a small but significant proportion of the variation in growth of both hosts, and soil properties accounted for a high proportion of the variation in both the plant growth and mycorrhizal infection, as shown by multiple regression analyses. Growth of Acer appeared to have a greater influence than soil factors on the variation in VA infection. ''Beading'' of Acer roots was negatively correlated with plant weight and soil phosphorus, suggesting a morphological response to P- deficiency.

In this paper, the characteristics, chemical composition, and changes in endophytic fungi of Qi-Nan agarwood induced after 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years were studied, and Qi-Nan white wood was used as the control. The results showed that the yield of Qi-Nan agarwood continued to increase with the induction time over a period of 3 years, while the content of alcohol extract from Qi-Nan agarwood reached its peak at two years. During the formation of agarwood, starch and soluble sugars in xylem rays and interxylary phloem are consumed and reduced. Most of the oily substances in agarwood were filled in xylem ray cells and interxylary phloem, and a small amount was filled in xylem vessels. The main components of Qi-Nan agarwood are also chromones and sesquiterpenes. With an increasing induction time, the content of sesquiterpenes increased, while the content of chromones decreased. The most abundant chromones in Qi-Nan agarwood were 2-(2-Phenethyl) chromone, 2-[2-(3-Methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyl) ethyl] chromone, and2-[2-(4-Methoxyphenyl) ethyl] chromone. Significant differences were observed in the species of the endophytic fungi found in Qi-Nan agarwood at different induction times. A total of 4 phyla, 73 orders, and 448 genera were found in Qi-Nan agarwood dominated by Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Different induction times had a significant effect on the diversity of the endophytic fungal community in Qi-Nan. After the induction of agarwood formation, the diversity of Qi-Nan endophytic fungi decreased. Correlation analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation between endophytic fungi and the yield, alcohol extract content, sesquiterpene content, and chromone content of Qi-Nan agarwood, which indicated that endophytic fungi play a role in promoting the formation of Qi-Nan agarwood. Qi-Nan agarwood produced at different induction times exhibited strong antioxidant capacity. DPPH free radical scavenging activity and reactive oxygen species clearance activity were significantly positively correlated with the content of sesquiterpenes and chromones in Qi-Nan agarwood.",wood; xylem; ray; phloem; vessel; xylem vessel; xylem vessels,culture_based; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Techniques used to chemically extract these compounds often neglect the intrinsic chemical characteristics of the molecules involved, such as the ability to form conjugate acids or bases and how they influence the solubilities of these molecules in organic solvents. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate how the pH of the fermented broth affects the process used to extract the secondary metabolites of the Diaporthe citri strain G-01 endophyte with ethyl acetate as the organic solvent. The analyzed samples, conducted by direct-infusion electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry, were grouped according to the pH of the fermented broth (i.e., <7 and >= 7). A more extreme pH (i.e., 2 or 12) was found to affect the chemical profile of the sample. Moreover, statistical analysis enabled us to determine the presence or absence of ions of high importance; for example, ions at 390.7 and 456.5 m/z were observed mainly at acidic pH, while 226.5, 298.3, and 430.1 m/z ions were observed at pH >= 7. Extraction at a pH between 4 and 9 may be of interest for exploring the differential secondary metabolites produced by endophytes. Furthermore, pH influences the chemical phenotype of the fungal metabolic extract.",NA,molecular; culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study focuses on the bacterial endophyte strain B.L.Ns.14, isolated from Nigella sativa leaves, which demonstrated multiple plant growth-promoting properties. In vitro tests showed that B.L.Ns.14 supports plant growth, colonization, and tolerance to abiotic stress. The strain also exhibited antifungal activity against phytopathogens such as Rhizoctonia solani, Colletotrichum acutatum, Verticillium dahliae, and Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici. Whole-genome analysis, supported by ANI and dDDH values, identified B.L.Ns.14 as Bacillus halotolerans. Genome mining revealed 128 active carbohydrate enzymes (Cazymes) related to endophytism and biocontrol functions, along with genes involved in phosphate solubilization, siderophore and IAA production, biofilm formation, and motility. Furthermore, genes for osmolyte metabolism, Na+/H+ antiporters, and stress response proteins were also identified. The genome harbors 12 secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, including those for surfactin, plipastatin mojavensin, rhizocticin A, and bacilysin, known for their antagonistic effects against fungi. Additionally, B.L.Ns.14 promoted Arabidopsis thaliana growth under both normal and saline conditions, and enhanced Solanum lycopersicum growth via seed biopriming and root irrigation. These findings suggest that Bacillus halotolerans B.L.Ns.14 holds potential as a biocontrol and plant productivity agent, warranting further field testing.",leaf; seed; root,culture_based; microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aims of our study were to describe the first report of sooty bark disease in Slovenia, to determine the pathogenicity of C. corticale, to confirm the optimum temperature for the growth of the fungus, and to determine the mass loss of Acer pseudoplatanus wood inoculated by C. corticale. We confirmed the presence of C. corticale on A. pseudoplatanus via morphological and molecular analysis. The optimal growth of C. corticale was measured in vitro on potato dextrose agar and was determined to occur at 25 degrees C. Pathogenicity tests were performed on 30 saplings of A. pseudoplatanus under two treatments, humid and drought stress, and the fungus was pathogenic in both treatments. The mean length of bark lesions and wood discoloration of the drought-stressed saplings was significantly greater than that in the humid treatment. Re-isolations of C. corticale were successful from all inoculated saplings, and thus Koch's postulates were confirmed. The mass loss of A. pseudoplatanus wood was determined by mini-block test in a period of 10 weeks and was observed as minimal. Based on the results, we conclude that C. corticale is a weak and opportunistic pathogen that most likely expresses itself intensively under hot and dry conditions.",bark; wood; lesion,culture_based; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction,NA,NA,NA,NA

Endophytic fungi can enhance host resistance to both biotic and abiotic stresses. Consequently, there is a need for further research on the biological characteristics of endophytic fungi. Such research can expand the existing endophytic fungal database and provide elite strains and effective strategies for the green remediation of saline-alkali soil and soil restoration. [Methods] The characteristics of the fungal strain were analyzed by plate culture under stress, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and multi-gene phylogenetic analysis. The colonization of the strain in rice roots was examined by GFP fluorescence labeling, trypan blue staining, SEM, and colonization curve plotting. Pot experiments under stress and non-stress conditions, the peroxidase activity assay, transcriptome analysis, and gene expression analysis were carried out to decipher the mechanism by which the strain enhanced the salt tolerance of rice plants. [Results] An endophytic fungal strain, LW2, capable of enhancing the salt tolerance of host rice plants, was obtained. The phylogenetic tree showed that LW2 clustered with Ophioceras leptosporum CBS 894.70 in the same minimal clade, and thus the strain was identified as O. leptosporum LW2. LW2 successfully colonized rice roots and promoted the growth of potted rice. The rice plants co-cultured with LW2 showed significant increases in the fresh weight, plant height, and stem width. The pot experiments under salt stress showed that LW2 improved the salt tolerance of rice by increasing the plant height and stem width under stress conditions while alleviating stress-induced wilting and yellowing. LW2 mitigated salt-induced damage of rice by increasing the peroxidase activity and promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging. In addition, LW2 regulated the expression of EIL1 and HKTs in the ethylene signaling pathway which affected ion transport, thereby enhancing rice salt tolerance. [Conclusion] This study identified an endophytic fungal strain, O. leptosporum LW2, capable of enhancing the salt tolerance of host rice. We preliminarily investigate the salt tolerance mechanism of this strain, providing scientific evidence and an elite strain for microbial remediation of saline-alkaline soil and the development of green agriculture. © 2025, Acta Microbiologica Sinica Editorial Office.

In order to select the best concentration of salicylic acid (SA) to promote seed germination and seedling growth of drunken horse grass (Achnatherum inebrians) under salt stress, six SA concentrations were selected to soak the seeds of infected endophytic fungus (E+) and uninfected endophytic fungus (E−) drunken horse grass under 200 mmol·L−1 NaCl stress. The germination rate, germination index, radicle length, germ length, bud water content, and other indicators were determined. The results showed that NaCl inhibited the germination of E+ and E− drunken horse grass seeds and seedling growth. Low concentration (0.05～0.5 mmol·L−1) SA was shown to promote seed germination and seedling growth, while high concentration (1 mmol·L−1) SA showed significant inhibition (P < 0.05). The comprehensive evaluation results of fuzzy mathematics membership function showed that 0.1 and 0.05 mmol·L−1 SA were the best concentrations to promote the seed germination and seedling growth of E+ and E− drunken horse grass, respectively. The main indices used to evaluate the effects of SA on alleviating salt damage in E+ and E− drunken horse grass seeds were radicle length, vigor index, dry weight, germination rate, germination potential, germination index, fresh weight, and seedling water content. © 2022 Editorial Office of Pratacultural Science.

Such associations are highly advantageous for the organisms involved, benefiting soil microbes by providing them access to plant metabolites, while plant growth and development are enhanced through the promotion of nutrient uptake and/or protection against (a)biotic stresses. While the establishment and maintenance of mutualistic associations have been shown to require genetic and epigenetic reprogramming, as well as an exchange of effector molecules between microbes and plants, whether short RNAs are able to effect such changes is currently unknown. Here, we established an interaction between the model grass species Brachypodium distachyon (Bd, Pooideae) and the beneficial fungal root endophyte Serendipita indica (Si, syn. Piriformospora indica, Sebacinales) to elucidate RNA interference-based regulatory changes in gene expression and small (s)RNA profiles that occurred during establishment of a Sebacinalean symbiosis.ResultsColonization of Bd roots with Si resulted in higher grain yield, confirming the mutualistic character of this interaction. Resequencing of the Si genome using the Oxford Nanopore technique, followed by de novo assembly yielded in 57 contigs and 9441 predicted genes, including putative members of several families involved in sRNA production. Transcriptome analysis at an early stage of the mutualistic interaction identified 2963 differentially expressed genes (DEG) in Si and 317 in Bd line 21-3. The fungal DEGs were largely associated with carbohydrate metabolism, cell wall degradation, and nutrient uptake, while plant DEGs indicated modulation of (a)biotic stress responses and defense pathways. Additionally, 10% of the upregulated fungal DEGs encode candidate protein effectors, including six DELD proteins typical for Sebacinales. Analysis of the global changes in the sRNA profiles of both associated organisms revealed several putative endogenous plant sRNAs expressed during colonization belonging to known micro (mi)RNA families involved in growth and developmental regulation. Among Bd- and Si-generated sRNAs with putative functions in the interacting organism, we identified transcripts for proteins involved in circadian clock and flowering regulation as well as immunity as potential targets of fungal sRNAs, reflecting the beneficial activity of Si.ConclusionsWe detected beneficial effects of Si colonization on Bd growth and development, and established a novel plant-mutualist interaction model between these organisms. Together, the changes in gene expression and identification of interaction-induced sRNAs in both organisms support sRNA-based regulation of defense responses and plant development in Bd, as well as nutrient acquisition and cell growth in Si. Our data suggests that a Sebacinalean symbiosis involves reciprocal sRNA targeting of genes during the interaction.",root; cell wall,molecular; microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both these isolates caused mortality in the greater wax moth, and hence can be considered entomopathogens. Spores of the isolates were also pathogenic to nymphs of the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae), with an LC50 value of 10(7) spores/mL 4 days after inoculation and an LT(50 )of 4.2 days with a dose of 10(8) spores/mL. in vitro antifungal assays also demonstrated a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of two fungi that are pathogenic to peppers, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Phytophthora capsici.

Frequency of incidence on different hosts varied between tree species, with the highest rate on oaks and the lowest on linden. The results also suggest the ubiquitous occurrence of T. dryina on oaks in Poland. This situation is in contrast to previous observations showing much lower frequency of this fungus in the past. A preliminary, ITS-based, analysis of genetic diversity among Polish isolates of T. dryina revealed the presence of two distinct haplotypes, both of which are widespread in Poland and occur on the same trees in most locations.

These endophytes are known to produce a range of alkaloids that enhance their host's resistance to insects or are toxic to grazing animals. Among the alkaloids, loline alkaloids (saturated 1-aminopyrrolizidines) are generally observed in the highest concentrations in many Neotyphodium-grass symbiotic associations, and are known to be toxic to insects but not to mammals. Some Neotyphodium-infected grasses have enhanced resistance to rice leaf bug, Trigonotylus caelestialium (Kirkaldy) (Heteroptera: Miridae), one of the major pests for rice production in Japan. Our laboratory experiments quantified the effects of purified loline (N-formylloline) and in planta synthesis of loline alkaloids by meadow fescue [Lolium pratense (Huds.) S.J. Darbyshire (syn. Festuca pratensis Huds.)]-Neotyphodium uncinatum (Gams, Petrini & Schmidt) Glenn, Bacon & Hanlin and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.)-Neotyphodium occultans Moon, Scott & Christensen associations on the development and survival of T. caelestialium. No-choice feeding assays with laboratory populations of the insect revealed that their growth was significantly decreased by the infected grasses, and the effect was greater for N. uncinatum than for N. occultans, in keeping with differences in N-formylloline concentrations in the plants. Artificial feeding of N-formylloline through feeding sachets indicated that the chemical has an adverse effect on survival of larvae, even at the lowest concentration tested (50 mu g/g), which was considerably lower than the typical concentrations in many Neotyphodium-grass associations. The results confirmed the ability of Neotyphodium-infected forage grasses to control T. caelestialium propagation in meadows, which may cause damages to nearby rice paddies.",leaf,plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, endophytic fungi were isolated from Eucalyptus camaldulensis trees, and their antifungal activity was evaluated against four significant plant pathogens namely Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, Macrophomina phaseolina, and Rhizoctonia solani. For this aim, 754 fungal isolates were obtained from 44 healthy fruit, leaf, and branch samples collected from five provinces of Iran. Subsequently, 27 fungal genera were identified based on morphological characteristics and molecular data of ITS region, with Neofusicoccum, Cladosporium, Didymosphaeria, and Chaetomium being the most commonly found genera. Based on the morphological characteristics, 170 isolates were chosen and their antifungal activities were assessed against the aforementioned pathogens in vitro through dual culture and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) tests. Based on the results, five isolates comprising Trichoderma sp. KL1, Trichoderma sp. 8S1, Chaetomium sp. DL4, Phaeophleospora sp. XL4, and Pseudosydowia sp. VL3 were selected for further investigation, which included examining their chitinase and cellulase secretion capabilities as potential antagonism mechanisms and their ability to solubilize phosphate as a growth-promoting mechanism. Furthermore, the antifungal activity of the selected isolates was evaluated against plant pathogens on tomato plants under greenhouse conditions. Their impact on plant growth parameters was also assessed. In vitro and greenhouse experiments demonstrated that each selected isolate exhibited varying levels of control against different pathogens. Among the isolates, Trichoderma sp. isolates KL1 and 8S1 consistently exhibited the strongest inhibition of disease severity for all four pathogens under greenhouse conditions. Lastly, the selected isolates were identified as Trichoderma longibrachiatum KL1, T. longibrachiatum 8S1, Chaetomium globosum DL4, Phaeophleospora eucalypticola XL4, and Pseudosydowia eucalypti VL3 based on their morphological features and molecular data of the ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 and tef-1 alpha genomic regions.",fruit; leaf; branch,culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the present study, roots, stems and leaves of H. muticus growing in Egypt were evaluated for the presence of associated fungal endophytes, and secondary metabolites produced from them especially the characteristic plant tropane alkaloid; hyoscyamine. Using culture-dependent approach, sixteen fungal endophytes belonging to five different genera were identified morphologically according to their culture appearance and detailed microscopic structures. The isolated endophytic fungi were cultured using three different media (PDB, RG and SDB) and each filtered broth was sequentially extracted with ethyl acetate. Crude extracts collected from different fungal isolates were subjected to phytochemical analysis using thin layer chromatography (TLC) which showed a distinct fingerprinting profile of several fungal secondary metabolites. The total secondary metabolite, phenolic compound, flavonoid, anthraquinone glycoside, coumarins and alkaloid content was investigated. Different activities of the used media were reported on the changing secondary metabolic profile of each fungus. Furthermore, the ability of the tested fungal endophytes to produce hyoscyamine, characteristic to H. muticus was tested by TLC analysis.

In microbial communities, the predominant focus has been on the well-touted ability of microbes to disperse and the environment acting as a selective filter to determine which species are present. In this study, we investigated the role of biotic interactions (e.g., competition, facilitation) in fungal endophyte community assembly by examining endophyte species co-occurrences within communities using null models. We used recombinant inbred lines (genotypes) of maize (Zea mays) to examine community assembly at multiple habitat levels, at the individual plant and host genotype levels. Both culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches were used to assess endophyte communities. Communities were analyzed using the complete fungal operational taxonomic unit (OTU) dataset or only the dominant (most abundant) OTUs in order to ascertain whether species co-occurrences were different for dominant members compared to when all members were included. In the culture-dependent approach, we found that for both datasets, OTUs co-occurred on maize genotypes more frequently than expected under the null model of random species co-occurrences. In the culture-independent approach, we found that OTUs negatively co-occurred at the individual plant level but were not significantly different from random at the genotype level for either the dominant or complete datasets. Our results showed that interspecific interactions can affect endophyte community assembly, but the effects can be complex and depend on host habitat level. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine endophyte community assembly in the same host species at multiple habitat levels. Understanding the processes and mechanisms that shape microbial communities will provide important insights into microbial community structure and the maintenance of microbial biodiversity.",NA,culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

We therefore hypothesized that wild plants have retained beneficial endophytes that are less abundant or not present in related crop plants. To test this hypothesis, we selected two endophytes that were found in Sharon goatgrass, an ancestor of wheat, and tested their effect on bread wheat. Both endophytes infected wheat and improved sustainability and performance under water-limited conditions. To determine how the endophytes modify plant development, we measured parameters of plant growth and physiological status and performed a comparative metabolomics analysis. Endophyte-treated wheat plants had reduced levels of stress damage markers and reduced accumulation of stress-adaptation metabolites. Metabolomics profiling revealed significant differences in the response to water stress of endophyte-treated plants compared with untreated plants. Our results demonstrate the potential of endophytes from wild plants for improvement of related crops and show that the beneficial effects of two endophytes are associated with alteration of physiological responses to water-limited conditions.",NA,physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

The objective of this study was to determine changes in ergovaline and total ergot alkaloid concentrations in tall fescue silage produced at high moisture (650 to 680 g H2O kg(-1)) and low moisture (340 to 400 g H2O kg(-1)). The study was conducted on endophyte-infected pastures of tall fescue in northern and southern Missouri. Tall fescue was clipped after seedhead emergence but before anthesis, wilted to high or low moisture, baled, and wrapped. After >100 d of ensiling, bales were cored and samples analyzed for ergovaline and total ergot alkaloid concentrations. Ergovaline concentration decreased (P < 0.05) during ensiling at both locations and moisture levels, and the decrease ranged from 24 to 58%. In contrast, total ergot alkaloid concentrations increased during ensiling in high moisture silage in northern (P < 0.10) and southern (P < 0.05) Missouri but did not change in low moisture silage. The opposing responses of ergovaline and total ergot alkaloids offer partial explanations for differences reported in studies involving tall fescue silage.

Gams) C. W. Bacon & Schardl, a fungal endophyte that infects tall fescue [Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh.] and causes fescue toxicosis in livestock. Previous studies have reported the distribution of ergovaline among anatomical parts during reproductive development. This study was conducted to determine the vertical distribution of ergovaline and total ergot alkaloids throughout the vegetative canopy of tall fescue. Between October 2012 and April 2014, whole tillers were harvested four times from a stand of Epichloe-infected 'Kentucky 31' tall fescue near Alton, MO. Harvests occurred in April before boot stage and in October before killing frost. Tillers were sliced into four segments: 0 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 15, and >15 cm, where 0 cm was the soil level, and >15 cm was the top of the canopy. Segments were analyzed for ergovaline and total ergot alkaloids. For tillers harvested in April, ergovaline concentration averaged 272 mu g kg(-1) dry matter (DM) in the 0- to 5-cm segment and decreased linearly upward through the canopy. In October, breakpoint regression indicated that ergovaline concentration averaged 1121 mu g kg(-1) DM in the 0- to 5-cm segment and >= 70% less above 5 cm. Total ergot alkaloid distribution patterns resembled ergovaline distribution in October; total ergot alkaloids averaged 2585 mu g kg(-1) DM in the 0- to 5-cm segment and >60% less in the upper portion of the canopy.

It was supposed that P. liquidambari B3 could enhance the efficiency of nodulation and nitrogen fixation by enriching the diversity of nodular endophytic bacteria under continous monocropping system. To verify this hypothesis, a pot experiment was conducted under natural conditions. Four treatments were set as follow: discontinuous cropping soil (NS), continuous cropping soil (CK), continuous cropping soil inoculate with actived P. liquidambari B3 (CSB3), and continuous cropping soil inoculate with sterilized P. liquidambari B3 (CSIB3). As a result, a total of 120 isolates were obtained. Our study clearly declared that the addition of fungal endophyte effectively enriched the genetic diversity and the community composition in CSB3. In contrast, a low genetic diversity level and simplex community structure were exhibited in CK and CSIB3.

Methods: NAF-1 an endophyte actinobacteria was isolated from leaves of medicinal plant Aloe vera collected in Marrakesh, Morocco using Bennett agar as selective medium. NAF-1 was tested for its antimicrobial activity against five pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus PIC 53156, Micrococcus luteus ATCC381, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 14579, Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 50090 and Escherichia coif ATCC 8739 and four human clinic fungi belonging to the Candida, Aspergillus and Microsporum genera. Several antioxidant activities were studied such as DPPH free radical scavenging, beta-carotene and linoleic acid and reducing power assays. The total of phenol and fiavonoid was also calculated. Using Artemia salina shrimp assay, the cytotoxicity of NAF-1 crude extract was determined. Results: The results revealed that the actinobacteria showed a high activity (>= 2 mm) against only Gram positive bacteria but it had a moderate activity (between 13 and 15 mm) against Human clinic fungi. The isolate also exhibited a LD50 of 14.20 mu g/mL in the cytotoxicity assay. The result showed that the crude extract presented an interesting free radical-scavenging activity with IC50 value of (5.58 +/- 0.26) mu g/mL and a high value of phenolic and flavonoid compounds with (15.41 +/- 0.18) mu g GAE/mg extract and (11.41 +/- 0.06) mu g QE/mg extract respectively. Moreover, the taxonomic position of our endophyte actinobacteria using the morphological and physiological criteria and using 16S rRNA gene sequence (polyphasic approach) showed that the NAF-1 isolate was similar to Streptomyces hydrogenans which was never described as an endophyte actinobacteria. Conclusions: This isolated strain appears promising resources of bioactive agents and can be exploited to produce therapeutic agents active against pathogenic disease.",leaf,molecular; culture_based; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Towards characterizing the endophytic population of Z. zerumbet rhizomes, experiments were carried out during two different growing seasons viz., early-June of 2013 and late-July of 2014. A total of 34 endophytes were isolated and categorized into 11 morphologically distinct groups. Fungi were observed to predominate bacterial species with colonization frequency values ranging from 12.5 to 50 %. Among the 11 endophyte groups isolated, molecular analyses based on ITS/16S rRNA gene sequences identified seven isolate groups as Fusarium solani, two as F. oxysporum and one as the bacterium Rhizobium spp. Phylogenetic tree clustered the ITS sequences from Z. zerumbet endophytes into distinct clades consistent with morphological and sequence analysis. Dual culture assays were carried out to determine antagonistic activity of the isolated endophytes against Pythium myriotylum, an economically significant soilborne phytopathogen of cultivated ginger. Experiments revealed significant P. myriotylum growth inhibition by F. solani and F. oxysporum isolates with percentage of inhibition (PoI) ranging from 45.17 +/- 0.29 to 62.2 +/- 2.58 with F. oxysporum exhibiting higher PoI values against P. myriotylum. Using ZzEF8 metabolite extract, concentration-dependent P. myriotylum hyphal growth inhibition was observed following radial diffusion assays. These observations were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy analysis wherein exposure to ZzEF8 metabolite extract induced hyphal deformities.

Relationships between hosts and fungal symbionts may change during deposition of anthmpogenic N and P. We studied the long-term effects of N and P addition on two ericaceous shrubs, Cantina vulgaris and Erica tetralix, at Whim Bog, Scotland by analyzing fungal colonization of roots, enzymatic activity, and fungal species composition. Unexpectedly, the frequency of typical ERM intracellular colonization did not change while the occurrence of ERM hyphae tended to increase and DSE hyphae to decrease. Our findings indicate that altered nutrient limitations shift root associated fungal colonization patterns as well as affect ericaceous root enzyme activity and thereby decomposition potential.

Serendipita indica is an endophytic fungus that establishes mutualistic relationships with many different plants including important crops as well as the model plant A. thaliana. Successful root colonization typically results in growth promotion and enhanced tolerance against various biotic and abiotic stresses. The fungus delivers phosphorus to the host and receives in exchange carbohydrates. There are hints that S. indica prefers hexoses, glucose, and fructose, products of saccharose cleavage driven by invertases (INVs) and sucrose synthases (SUSs). Carbohydrate metabolism in this interaction, however, remains still widely unexplored. Therefore, in this work, the sugar pools as well as the expression of SUSs and cytosolic INVs in plants colonized by S. indica were analyzed. Using sus1/2/3/4 and cinv1/2 mutants the importance of these genes for the induction of growth promotion and proper root colonization was demonstrated. Furthermore, the expression of several defense-related marker genes in both multiple mutants in comparison to the wild-type plants was determined. Our results show that in colonized A. thaliana plants S. indica manipulates the sugar metabolism by altering the expression of host's INV and SUS and modulates both the sugar pools and plant defense in its favor. We conclude that the interaction A. thaliana-S. indica is a balancing act between cooperation and exploitation, in which sugar metabolism plays a crucial role. Small changes in this mechanism can lead to severe disruption resulting in the lack of growth promotion or altered colonization rate.",root,microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Two field experiments were conducted on Cecil sandy-loam soils (clayey, kaolinitic, thermic Typic Kanhapuldults) to investigate the effects of endophyte infection on seed production and associated traits. The studies used endophyte-infected and uninfected clones of the same plant genotypes. In Exp. I and II, endophyte infection resulted in 79 and 32% more total seed by weight, 60 and 33% more seeds per plant, 20 and 34% more panicles per plant, and 32 and 4% more seeds per panicle, respectively. The 300-seed wt. was greater for infected plants in Exp. I but not in Exp. II. Plant genotype .times. fungal status interactions occurred for all traits except for seeds per plant and seeds per panicle to Exp. II. These interactions occurred largely because the effect of the endophyte varied from no or small increases to significant increases in trait expression for different plant genotypes. The results indicate that endophyte-infected tall fescue plants have much higher relative fitness for seed production than uninfected plants.

Genetic diversity of G. setacea was found to be very high: every isolate studied was a unique genotype, even within the same leaf.

The fungi co-inhabiting Cenococcum geophilum ectomycorrhizae (ECM) of Allies balsamea, Betula papyrifera and Picea glauca were studied at two boreal forest sites in Eastern Canada by direct PCR of ITS rDNA. 50 non-Cenococcum fungal sequence types were detected, including several potentially mycorrhizal species as well as fungal root endophytes. Non-melanized ascomycetes dominated, in contrast to the dark septate endophytes (DSE) reported in most culture dependent studies. The results demonstrate significant differences in root associated fungal assemblages among the host species studied. Fungal diversity was also host dependent, with P. glauca roots supporting a more diverse community than A. balsamea.

Beneficial interactions with microorganisms may be crucial for ameliorating these stressors and facilitating the ecosystem services host organisms provide. Foliar endophytes, microorganisms that reside within leaves, are found in essentially all plants and can provide important benefits (e.g., enhanced drought tolerance or resistance to herbivory). However, it remains unclear how important the legacy effects of the abiotic stressors that select on these microbiomes are for affecting the degree of stress amelioration provided to their hosts. To elucidate foliar endophytes' role in host-plant salt tolerance, especially if salinity experienced in the field selects for endophytes that are better suited to improve the salt tolerance of their hosts, we combined field collections of 90 endophyte communities from 30 sites across the coastal Everglades with a manipulative growth experiment assessing endophyte inoculation effects on host-plant performance. Specifically, we grew >350 red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) seedlings in a factorial design that manipulated the salinity environment the seedlings experienced (freshwater vs. saltwater), the introduction of field-collected endophytes (live vs. sterilized inoculum), and the legacy of salinity stress experienced by these introduced endophytes, ranging from no salt stress (0 parts per thousand [ppt] salinity) to high salt stress (40 ppt) environments. We found that inoculation with field-collected endophytes significantly increased mangrove performance across almost all metrics examined (15%-20% increase on average), and these beneficial effects typically occurred when the endophytes were grown in saltwater. Importantly, our study revealed the novel result that endophyte-conferred salinity tolerance depended on microbiome salinity legacy in a key coastal foundation species. Salt-stressed mangroves inoculated with endophyte microbiomes from high-salinity environments performed, on average, as well as plants grown in low-stress freshwater, while endophytes from freshwater environments did not relieve host salinity stress. Given the increasing salinity stress imposed by sea level rise and the importance of foundation species like mangroves for ecosystem services, our results indicate that consideration of endophytic associations and their salinity legacy may be critical for the successful restoration and management of coastal habitats.",leaf,culture_based; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Altogether, 12 different endophytic fungi were isolated from roots, stems, and leaves of V. cristata of which most species belonged to Ascomycota. Unidentified II fungi were found to be most effective for auxin synthesis and phosphate solubilization while Agaricus bisporous and Mycolepto discus were most effective for ammonia synthesis.

They exhibit a remarkable taxonomic diversity, extending to a broad spectrum of bacterial and fungal communities, with their distribution linked to several abiotic and biotic factors. Understanding mechanisms underlying endophyte colonization, establishment, and signalling pathways involved in endophyte-host interactions has become crucial in bioprospecting novel bioactive metabolites and biocontrol of pests and pathogens. This review aims to underscore the pivotal roles of medicinal plant endophytes in modulating plant growth dynamics and the biosynthesis of various classes of bioactive compounds with notable applications in the fields of pharmaceuticals, bioremediation and agriculture. The novelty of this review lies in its attempt to collate ethnobotanical knowledge of medicinal plants with the technicalities of modern OMICs technologies, such as metabolomics and metagenomics, which in recent years have been pivotal for screening and characterization of bioactive compounds and in understanding the mechanistic perspectives of intermolecular networking. These OMICs-based technologies also provide insights into the genes and metabolites synthesized by endophytes, offering an in-depth understanding of the various metabolic profiles and genomic characteristics of endophytic population dynamics. Coupling endophyte bioactive compound bioprospecting from various underexplored ecosystems with modern synthetic biology techniques could also potentially open up novel avenues leading to the development of ""Magic bullets"" to address the rising threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Although abundant and frequent in all plant organs, the role of endophytic fungi has been neglected in relation to orchid's early development. Pogoniopsis schenckii Cogn. is an aclorophyllated and mycoheterotrophic (MH) orchid.

Six genera of fungi were isolated and identified through the partial sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region, all belonging to the phylum Ascomycota. Also, Tulasnellaceae was identified through uncultured technique as potentially mycorrhizal in this MH orchid. Some isolates of the genera Trichoderma, Fusarium, and especially Clonostachys presented germinative potential on P. schenckii seeds, causing rupture of the external tegument. The protocorms showed complete absence of peloton formation, but fungal hyphae were clearly observed within living cells.

This study focused on the exploration and characterization of culturable endophytic fungi inhabiting the medicinal plant Dillenia indical. during four different seasons (summer, monsoon, autumn, and winter) from 2018 to 2019. A total of 2360 segments from different parts (leaves, fruits, and stem) were screened to isolate endophytic fungi. During the study, 25 species of fungi belonging to 20 genera were isolated from the selected plant. The identification of these fungi was validated at morphological, microscopic, and molecular levels. Results indicate the plant has the highest affinity for Daldinia eschscholtzii, followed by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Cladosporium cladosporioides. Further, the percent frequency was highest in leaves, followed by stem and fruits. The results were further supported by a similar trend of colonization rate for different plant parts. The monsoon season had the highest number of isolates (312), followed by summer (208), winter (164), and autumn (114). Species diversity was highest during the monsoon season and lowest during the winter. These fungi also produce amylase, lipase, protease, asparaginase, cellulase, and ligninolytic enzymes. This study focused only on culturable fungal endophytes, yet the scope can be extended for other non-culturable microbes and their interaction by using high-throughput genomics and novel next-generation sequencing (NGS) tools.

Sand-based, aseptic microlysimeter units were constructed for the collection of rhizodeposit solutions for chemical analyses from the roots of endophyte-free (E-) and endophyte-infected (E+) tall fescue plants. E+ plants were infected with Neotyphodium coenophialum, the most common endophyte found in tall fescue. Rhizodeposit solutions collected over nine weeks from E+ grass contained more organic carbon and carbohydrates than E-. These solutions were allowed to percolate through columns of plant-free soils to assess the response of the soil microbial communities. Soils to which solutions from E+ grass were applied had significantly higher respiration rates than those receiving solutions from E- grass, suggesting that microbial activity was stimulated by changes in the rhizodeposits. Culture-based assays of the soil microbial community (plate counts and community-level physiological profiling) suggest that the basic structure of the microbial community was not affected by application of rhizodeposit solutions from E+ plants as compared to E-. Our results indicate that the presence of a fungal endophyte may enhance rhizodeposition by tall fescue and could consequently influence microbial mineralization processes in the soil.

Fungal community composition was determined using both culture-based and molecular ap-proaches across two loci. Wood decay fungi, including those that cause heart rot, were detected in approximately 80% of all samples. Fungal community composition differed according to the survey approach (high throughput sequencing vs. isolation of fungi into culture) and between geographic location and individual trees, but no significant patterns were detected at different heights in individual trees or around their circumferences. ITS and LSU sequencing detected more distinct taxa than culturing. However, LSU primers yielded more OTUs than did ITS primers, though both identified unique OTUs.

Investigating endophytic bacterial plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits and co-inoculation effects on legumes' performance is a candidate. Endophytic bacteria were isolated from Vicia sativa root nodules. Such endophytes were screened for their PGP traits, hydrolytic enzymes, and antifungal activities. Sterilized Vicia faba and Pisum sativum seedlings were co-inoculated separately with seven different endophytic bacterial combinations before being planted under sterilized conditions. Later on, several growth-related traits were measured. Eleven endophytes (six rhizobia, two non-rhizobia, and three actinomycetes) could be isolated, and all of them were indole-acetic-acid (IAA) producers, while seven isolates could solubilize phosphorus, whereas three, five, five, and four isolates could produce protease, cellulase, amylase, and chitinase, respectively. Besides, some of these isolates possessed powerful antifungal abilities against six soil-borne pathogenic fungi. Co-inoculation of tested plants with endophytic bacterial mixes (Rhizobiamix+Actinomix+non-Rhizobiamix), (Rhizobiamix+Actinomix), or (Rhizobiamix+non-Rhizobiamix) significantly improved the studied growth parameters (shoot, root fresh and dry weights, length and yield traits) compared to controls, whereas co-inoculated plants with (Rhizobiaalone), (non-Rhizobiamix), or (Actinomix) significantly recorded lower growth parameters. Five efficient endophytes were identified: Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. Viciae, Rhizobium pusense, Brevibacterium frigoritolerans, Streptomyces variabilis, and Streptomyces tendae. Such results suggested that these isolates could be utilized as biocontrols and biofertilizers to improve legumes productivity.

Insoluble [14C]carbohydrate was provided at a point source available only to the external mycorrhizal mycelium of protocorms, plantlets (up to 50 mg w wt) or plants. Protocorms and plantlets obtained 14C via their external mycelium but plants did not, even when stressed for carbon by being kept in darkness for two weeks. There was no enhancement of growth of mycorrhizal plants when a carbon source was present in the substrate over an eight-week period. When 14CO2 was fed to plant shoots to monitor movement of carbon from plant to endophyte, there was no evidence of such movement over a 7 d period.

Among these isolates, ceriponol B possessed an unprecedent 12-nortremulane skeleton. The structures of all isolates were elucidated by spectroscopic methods, including MS and NMR (1D and 2D) spectroscopic techniques. The cytotoxic activities of ceriponols A-K were evaluated against three human tumor cell lines (HeLa, HepG2, and SGC 7901). Ceriponols F and K exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against all the tested human cancer cell lines with IC50 values ranging from 32.3 +/- 0.4 to 173.2 +/- 1.5 mu M, while ceriponol G showed slightly better cytotoxicity against a HeLa cell line.

Although fungal communities are widely distributed, relatively few studies have correlated agricultural production practices. We investigated the diversity, composition and ecological functionality of fungal communities in roots of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) growing in conventional and organic farming systems. Direct and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications spanning the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the rDNA from pooled fine root samples were performed with two different sets of fungal specific primers. Fungal identification was carried out through similarity searches against validated reference sequences (RefSeq). The R package 'picante' and FUNGuild were used to analyse fungal community composition and trophic mode, respectively. Either by direct or cloning sequencing, 130 complete ITS sequences were clustered into 39 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (25 singletons), belonging to the Ascomycota (24), the Basidiomycota (14) and to the Glomeromycota (1). Fungal communities from conventional farming sites are phylogenetically more related than expected by chance. Constrained ordination analysis identified total N, total S and Pcal that had a significant effect on the OTU's abundance and distribution, and a further correlation with the diversity of the co-occurring vegetation could be hypothesised. The functional predictions based on FUNGuild suggested that conventional farming increased the presence of plant pathogenic fungi compared with organic farming. Based on diversity, OTU distribution, nutrition mode and the significant phylogenetic clustering of fungal communities, this study shows that fungal communities differ across sampling sites, depending on agricultural practices. Although it is not fully clear which factors determine the fungal communities, our findings suggest that organic farming systems have a positive effect on fungal communities in winter wheat crops.",root,molecular; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

We examined the phylogenetic relationships among various genera of aquatic hyphomycetes belonging to the Leotiomycetes (Ascomycota) using sequences of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large subunit (LSU) regions of rDNA generated from 42 pure cultures including 19 ex-types. These new sequence data were analyzed together with additional sequences from 36 aquatic hyphomycetes and 60 related fungi obtained from GenBank. Aquatic hyphomycetes, characterized by their tetraradiate or sigmoid conidia, were scattered in nine supported clades within the Helotiales (Leotiomycetes). Tricladium, Lemonniera, Articulospora, Anguillospora, Varicosporium, Filosporella, and Flagellospora are not monophyletic, with species from the same genus distributed among several major clades. The Gyoerffyella clade and the Hymenoscyphus clade accommodated species from eight and six different genera, respectively. Thirteen aquatic hyphomycete taxa were grouped in the Leotia-Bulgaria clade while twelve species clustered within the Hymenoscyphus clade along with several amphibious ascomycetes. Species of Filosporella and some species from four other aquatic genera were placed in the Ascocoryne-Hydrocina clade. It is evident that many aquatic hyphomycetes have relatives of terrestrial origin. Adaptation to colonize the aquatic environment has evolved independently in multiple phylogenetic lineages within the Leotiomycetes. (C) 2013 The British Mycological Society.

Many endophytes were found to secrete specialized metabolites and/or emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which may be biologically active and assist fungal survival inside the plant as well as benefit their hosts. We report on the isolation and characterization of a VOCs-emitting endophytic fungus, isolated from an olive tree (Olea europaea L.) growing in Israel; the isolate was identified as Daldinia cf. concentrica. We found that the emitted VOCs were active against various fungi from diverse phyla. Results from postharvest experiments demonstrated that D. cf. concentrica prevented development of molds on organic dried fruits, and eliminated Aspergillus niger infection in peanuts. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the volatiles led to identification of 27 VOCs. On the basis of these VOCs we prepared two mixtures that displayed a broad spectrum of antifungal activity. In postharvest experiments these mixtures prevented development of molds on wheat grains, and fully eliminated A. niger infection in peanuts. In light of these findings, we suggest use of D. cf. concentrica and/or its volatiles as an alternative approach to controlling phytopathogenic fungi in the food industry and in agriculture.",fruit,molecular; culture_based; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

In recent years, there has been growing interest in endophytic fungi as valuable sources for drug discovery based on their rich metabolic profiles consisting of novel and bioactive compounds. Accordingly, our preliminary study demonstrated that an endophyte, namely Penicillium roseopurpureum isolated from Astragalus angustifolius, had high chemical diversity with an antiproliferative effect. Herein, fermentation of P. roseopurpureum resulted in the production of five new anthraquinone-type compounds (2, 4, 6, 7, 8) together with several known compounds [11-methoxycurvularin (1: epimeric mixture of 1a and 1b), carviolin (3), 11-hydroxycurvularin (5: diastereoisomeric mixture of 5a and 5b) and 1-O-methylemodin (9)]. The structures of the new compounds were established by NMR spectroscopy and HR-MS analysis. Cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that none of the compounds except for 1 and 5 had antiproliferative activity against prostate cancer cell lines. Interestingly, 1 was found as cytotoxic, whereas 5 exhibited cytostatic properties.

However, till now, no comprehensive study is available on the succession of endophytic fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) with roots of medicinal licorice plants and the effects of endophytic fungi and AMF on the secondary metabolite accumulation in licorice plant's root. Results In the current study, interaction between root and microbes in 1-3 years old medicinal licorice plant's root and rhizospheric soil was investigated. Secondary metabolites content in licorice root was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The composition and diversity of endophytic and AMF in the root and soil were deciphered using high-throughput sequencing technology. During the plant's growth period, as compared to AMF, time and species significantly affected the diversity and richness of endophytic fungi, such as Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Fusarium, Cladosporium, Sarocladium. The growth period also influenced the AMF diversity, evident by the significant increase in the relative abundance of Glomus and the significant decrease in the relative abundance of Diversispora. It indicated a different succession pattern between the endophytic fungal and AMF communities. Meanwhile, distance-based redundancy analysis and Mantel tests revealed root's water content and secondary metabolites (glycyrrhizic acid, liquiritin, and total flavonoids), which conferred endophytic fungi and AMF diversity. Additionally, plant growth significantly altered soil's physicochemical properties, which influenced the distribution of endophytic fungal and AMF communities. Conclusions This study indicated a different succession pattern between the endophytic fungal and AMF communities. During the plant's growth period, the contents of three secondary metabolites in roots increased per year, which contributed to the overall differences in composition and distribution of endophytic fungal and AMF communities. The endophytic fungal communities were more sensitive to secondary metabolites than AMF communities.

Of the nine described species, two (M. cannonballusandM. eutypoides) are important pathogens on the roots of members of Cucurbitaceae in agricultural settings. The remaining seven species are capable of colonizing roots from a diverse host range without causing obvious disease symptoms. Recent molecular and culture studies have shown that members of the genus are nearly ubiquitous as root endophytes in arid environments of the Southwestern United States. Isolates have been obtained from apparently healthy roots of grasses, shrubs and herbaceous plants located in central New Mexico and other regions of the Southwest. Phylogenetic and genomic analyses reveal substantial diversity in these isolates. The New Mexico isolates include close relatives ofM. cannonballusandM. ibericus, as well as isolates that represent previously unrecognized lineages. To explore evolutionary relationships within the genus and gain insights into potential ecological functions, we sequenced and assembled the genomes of threeM. cannonballusisolates, oneM. ibericusisolate, and six diverse New Mexico isolates. The assembled genomes were significantly larger than what is typical for the Sordariomycetes despite having predicted gene numbers similar to other members of the class. Differences in predicted genome content and organization were observed between endophytic and pathogenic lineages ofMonosporascus.

Our objective was to study the influence of drought on phytohormones and gas exchange parameters in Medicago saliva L. cv. Aragon associated with or in the absence of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and/or nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Four treatments were used: (1) plants inoculated with Glomus fasciculatum (Taxter sensu Gerd.) Gerdemann and Trappe and Rhizobium meliloti 102 F51 strain (MR); (2) plants inoculated with only Rhizobium (R); (3) plants inoculated with only mycorrhizae (M); and (4) non-inoculated plants (N). When endophytes were well established, treatments received different levels of phosphorus and nitrogen in the nutrient solution in order to obtain plants similar in size. Sixty days after planting, plants were subjected to two cycles of drought and recovery. Midday leaf water potential (Psi), CO2 exchange rate (CER), leaf conductance (g(w)) and transpiration (T), as well as leaf and root abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinin concentrations were measured after the second drought period. Gas exchange parameters were determined by infrared gas analysis. Cytokinins and ABA levels in tissues were analysed by ELISA and HPLC, respectively. Nodulated R and MR plants had the lowest ABA concentrations in roots under well-watered conditions. Water stress increased ABA concentrations in leaves of N, R and MR plants, while ABA concentration in M plants did not change. The highest production of ABA under water deficit was in the roots of non-mycorrhizal plants. The ratio of ABA to cytokinin concentration strongly increased in leaves and roots of non-mycorrhizal plants under drought. By contrast, this ratio was lowered in roots of M plants and remained unchanged in leaves and roots of MR plants when stress was imposed. The highest leaf conductances and transpirational fluxes under well-watered conditions were those of nitrogen-fixing R and MR plants, but these results were not impaired with increased CO2 exchange rates. Photosynthesis, leaf conductance and transpiration rates decreased in all treatments when stress was imposed, with the strongest decrease occurring in non-mycorrhizal plants. The relationships found between these gas exchange parameters and the hormone concentrations in stressed alfalfa tissues suggest that microsymbionts have an important role in the control of gas exchange of the host plant through hormone production in roots and the ABA/cytokinin balance in leaves.

We studied the relationship between forest fragment size and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) colonization, and the AMF spore communities in the rhizosphere of two congeneric Euphorbia species (native and exotic/invasive). We hypothesized that these fungal variables will differ with fragment size and species status, and predicted that (a) AMF and DSE colonization together with AMF spore abundance and diversity would be positively related to forest fragment size; (b) these relationships will differ between the exotic and the native species; and (c) there will be a negative relationship between forest fragment size and the availability of soil nutrients (NH4+, NO3-, and phosphorus). This study was performed in the eight randomly selected forest fragments (0.86-1000 ha), immersed in an agricultural matrix from the Chaquean region in central Argentina. AMF root colonization in the native and exotic species was similar, and was positively related with forest fragment size. Likewise, AMF spore diversity and spore abundance were higher in the larger fragments. While DSE root colonization in the native host was positively related with forest fragment size, DSE colonization in the exotic host showed no relationship. Soil nutrients contents were negatively related with forest fragment size. In addition, NH4+ and NO3- were negatively correlated with AMF spores abundance and root colonization and with DSE colonization in the native species. The results observed in this study show how habitat fragmentation might affect the interaction between key soil components, such as rhizospheric plant-fungal symbiosis and nutrient availability.

Their ecological importance is partly driven by their inherent patchiness. We used epifoliar fungi, a guild of common, benign, obligate, fungal symbionts of plants, as a model system to evaluate the relative importance of host phylogeny, host relative abundance, and microclimate on the three-dimensional distribution of plant-fungus symbioses. In parallel studies in rainforests in Panama and Australia, most epifoliar fungi were able to colonize several plant lineages but showed significant host preferences within the local plant community. More closely related plant species were not more likely to share fungal symbionts. Instead, fungal species were more likely to be shared by more abundant hosts, which supported a greater number and diversity of fungi. Environmental conditions strongly affected spatial distributions, with sites in the dark understory 2.5- to fourfold more likely to have epifoliar fungi than in the exposed forest canopy. In the understory, fungal incidence increased with canopy openness. Canopy trees supported only a subset of the fungal symbionts found in the understory, suggesting that adult trees are not reservoirs of these fungal symbionts for understory juveniles.",canopy,molecular; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Until now, there are few studies on the effects of diazotroph application on microbial communities of major crops. In this study, the diazotrophic and endospore-forming Paenibacillus triticisoli BJ-18 was inoculated into maize soils containing different N levels. The effects of inoculation on the composition and abundance of the bacterial, diazotrophic and fungal communities in the rhizosphere and root/shoot endosphere of maize were evaluated by sequencing the 16S rRNA, nifH gene and ITS (Inter Transcribed Spacer) region. P. triticisoli BJ-18 survived and propagated in all the compartments of the maize rhizosphere, root and shoot. The abundances and diversities of the bacterial and diazotrophic communities in the rhizosphere were significantly higher than in both root and shoot endospheres. Each compartment of the rhizosphere, root and shoot had its specific bacterial and diazotrophic communities. Our results showed that inoculation reshaped the structures of the bacterial, diazotrophic and fungal communities in the maize rhizosphere and endosphere. Inoculation reduced the interactions of the bacteria and diazotrophs in the rhizosphere and endosphere, while it increased the fungal interactions. After inoculation, the abundances of Pseudomonas, Bacillus and Paenibacillus in all three compartments, Klebsiella in the rhizosphere and Paenibacillus in the root and shoot were significantly increased, while the abundances of Fusarium and Giberella were greatly reduced.

Plants growing in biodiversity hotspots and having ethnobotanical utility are often explored for the presence of endophytic fungi with bioactive potential. Western Ghat mountains of India are one of the ten famous biodiversity hotspots in the world. Hence, in the present study, we investigated the diversity of endophytic fungi associated with tissues of Nothapodytes foetida (a tree), Hypericum mysorense (a shrub) and Hypericum japonicum (a herb) collected from forests of Western Ghats with emphasis on diversity of endophytic fungi harbored in different tissues of three plants and their antimicrobial and free radical scavenging activities. A total of 298 isolates belonging to 31 genera were isolated along with dark septate and sterile fungi. All isolates belonged to Dothidiomycetes, Eurotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes of the phylum Ascomycota. Most frequent colonizers were Penicillium, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Gliocladium, Cladosporium, Trichoderma, Colletotrichum, and Pestalotiopsis. Endophytes showed neither any host preference nor any dominance of a single species.

The disease is rapidly increasing and is observed regularly in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) forests in Europe. Changes in climatic conditions will gradually increase the damage of this pathogen, because it is favored by elevated temperatures and additionally the host trees will be more susceptible due to related environmental stress. Diplodia tip blight is emerging towards Northern latitudes, thus, actions to monitor the spread of S. sapinea in pine-dominated forests should be undertaken in Finland. Our aim was to search for S. sapinea in Scots pine along a transect in Finland. Branch samples were collected from healthy Scots pine, fungal endophytes were isolated and morphologically identified.

This interaction has been considered as mutualistic leading to growth promotion of the host. So far, only indolic glucosinolates and phytohormones have been identified as key players. In a comprehensive non-targeted metabolite profiling study, we analyzed Arabidopsis thaliana's roots, root exudates, and leaves of inoculated and non-inoculated plants by ultra performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/(ESI)-QTOFMS) and gas chromatography/electron ionization quadrupole mass spectrometry (GC/EI-QMS), and identified further biomarkers. Among them, the concentration of nucleosides, dipeptides, oligolignols, and glucosinolate degradation products was affected in the exudates. In the root profiles, nearly all metabolite levels increased upon co-cultivation, like carbohydrates, organic acids, amino acids, glucosinolates, oligolignols, and flavonoids. In the leaf profiles, we detected by far less significant changes. We only observed an increased concentration of organic acids, carbohydrates, ascorbate, glucosinolates and hydroxycinnamic acids, and a decreased concentration of nitrogen-rich amino acids in inoculated plants. These findings contribute to the understanding of symbiotic interactions between plant roots and fungi of the order of Sebacinales and are a valid source for follow-up mechanistic studies, because these symbioses are particular and clearly different from interactions of roots with mycorrhizal fungi or dark septate endophytes",root; leaf; mycorrhizal,molecular; culture_based; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

There are few control options other than insecticides. Epichloe endophytes that produce loline alkaloids in their hosts provide a possible mechanism of control, with both meadow fescue and tall fescue naturally infected with loline-producing endophytes showing a resistance to Rhopalosiphum padi. We screened Elymus spp. naturally infected with endophytes that produced loline alkaloids at concentrations known to affect aphids on fescue but found no effect on these insects infesting Elymus. A synthetic loline-producing endophyte association with rye also had no effect on the aphids. After hypothesizing that the lolines were being translocated in the xylem in Elymus and rye rather than the phloem, we tested the rye and meadow fescue infected with loline-producing endophytes against a xylem feeding spittlebug. The endophyte in rye inhibited the feeding of the insect and reduced its survival, whereas the endophyte-infected meadow fescue had no effect on the spittlebug but reduced the number of aphids. Lolines applied to the potting medium of endophyte-free and endophyte-infected rye, ryegrass, and tall fescue resulted in a decrease in the aphid populations on the endophyte-free pasture grasses relative to the untreated controls but had no effect on aphid numbers on the rye. We tentatively conclude that lolines, produced in both natural and synthetic association with Elymus and rye, are partitioned in the xylem rather than the phloem, where they are inaccessible to aphids.",xylem; phloem,molecular; culture_based; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

(Neottieae tribe), which harbours green and achlorophyllous individuals (=aalbinos), to understand albino survival and compare mycorrhizal associates, development, and nutrition of the two phenotypes. Albinos never changed phenotype over 14ayears and had development similar to green individuals; their chlorophyll content was reduced by 99.4%, making them heterotrophic. Molecular typing by polymerase chain reaction amplification of fungal intergenic transcribed spacer and microscopic analyses showed that Thelephoraceae (Basidiomycetes, usually forming ectomycorrhizae with trees) were mycorrhizal on both phenotypes. Molecular typing also demonstrated that additional fungi were present on roots, including many endophytes (such as Helotiales) and various ectomycorrhizal taxa, whose role and pattern of colonization remained unclear. Mycorrhizal colonization was increased in albinos by about twofold, but no obvious difference in fungal partners compared with green individuals was demonstrated. Analysis of stable isotope composition (N and C) showed that albinos were dependent on their fungi for carbon (mycoheterotrophy), while green individuals recovered 33% of their carbon from fungi (mixotrophy). Surrounding trees, which formed ectomycorrhizae with at least one Thelephoraceae found in orchids, were likely the ultimate carbon source. These data are discussed in the framework of evolution of mycoheterotrophy in orchids, especially in Neottieae.",mycorrhizal; root; anther,molecular; microscopy; inoculation,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this study, the role of inorganic plant nutrition fertilizer (IPN), organic fertilizer (OF) and bio-organic fertilizer (BOF) in avoiding monoculture-related production constraints was evaluated. We conducted a series of greenhouse experiments and studied the growth of chrysanthemum and changes in rhizosphere soil microflora and function. BOF application reduced the incidence of Fusarium wilt by 82.8% and increased the chrysanthemum shoot height and flower ray floret number by 31.4% and 26.1%, respectively. High-throughput Illumina HiSeq2500 sequencing results indicated that BOF and OF treatments increased the values of alpha-diversity indices of bacteria and fungi. In addition, significant alterations in microbe community structures were found in response to IPN, OF or BOF application. Among the major genera detected after BOF treatments, the levels of Fusarium and Glycomyces decreased while Cladosporium, arbuscular mycorrhizal and endophyte groups increased. In particular, the abundance of Mariniflexile had a positive relationship (R = 0.693, p < 0.05) with the incidence of Fusarium wilt, while Cladosporium showed a significant negative relationship (R = -0.586, p < 0.05). Interestingly, an analysis of microbiomes based on 16S rRNA sequences revealed that the functions of signal transduction, bacterial secretion system, oxidative phosphorylation and the metabolism of carbohydrate, nitrogen and amino acids all increased in both BOF and OF treatments. The results suggested that BOF could be effective for chrysanthemum monoculture soil restoration, potentially by altering the microbial community structures and functions, which affect the physiological and morphological attributes of chrysanthemum in monoculture.",shoot; flower; ray; mycorrhizal,molecular; culture_based; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

It might have effects on the plant's stress tolerance and endophytic community. Inoculation experiments were carried out on the roots of Asparagus with normal and inactivated Sj18, and the diversity and community structure of endophytes in the root of inoculated Asparagus were studied. It was found that Sj18 fungi affected the endophytic community of Asparagus roots. From being a low-abundance genus, the salt-tolerant bacterium Halomonas became the dominant genus. In order to verify that Sj18 can improve salt tolerance, Arabidopsis thaliana was inoculated with Sj18 in a salt tolerance test. The result showed that A. thaliana grew better in a high salt environment after inoculation with Sj18. Sj18 changed the microbe diversity, community composition and structure of endophytes in the roots of Asparagus, which increased the bacterial diversity.

The fungi were isolated and obtained previously from plant species of Cerrado and Atlantic Forest located in areas of environmental preservation in the State of Sao Paulo / Brazil, as part of the project ""Chemical and biological prospecting endophytic fungi associated to plant species of Cerrado and Atlantic Forest"". The compounds ethyl butyrate, ethyl acetate and methyl propionate were used as standards esters which were hydrolyzed by extracellular enzyme from endophytic fungi (EC. 3.1.1.1 - carboxylesterases) for production of carboxylic acids. Thus, the reduction of the pH increases the protonated indicator concentration (bromothymol blue), changing the color of the reaction medium (from blue to yellow), that can be observed and measured by spectrophotometry at 616 nm. The methodology with acid-base indicator was performed on 13 microorganisms, aiming Periconia atropurpurea as a potential source of esterase for biotransformation of short chain esters. The results also evidenced that this methodology showed to be efficient, fast, cheap, having low consumption of reagents and easy development, and can be applied to screen carboxylic-ester hydrolases in a large number of microorganisms.",NA,molecular; culture_based; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this respect, they have been attracting growing interest in the past few years. Endophytes are defined as microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi which have a mutualistic relationship with their host plants without causing any harm to their host. In this study, we isolated and identified bacterial endophytes from Centella asiatica collected in Western Cape, South Africa. Results Twenty bacterial endophytes were isolated from Centella asiatica and characterized by using morphological and molecular techniques. Based on molecular traits, the isolates were identified as Pseudomonas sp. strain SGM1, Pseudomonas sp. strain SGM2, Pseudomonas sp. strain SGM3, Pseudomonas sp. strain SGM4, Pseudomonas sp. strain SGM5, Pseudomonas sp. strain SGM6, Pseudomonas sp. strain SGM7, Novosphingobium sp. strain SGM8, Pseudomonas sp. strain SGM9, Pseudomonas sp. strain SGM10, Chryseobacterium sp. strain SGM11, Enterobacter sp. strain SGM12, Enterobacter sp. strain SGM13, Pseudomonas sp. strain SGM14, Enterobacter sp. strain SGM15, Enterobacter sp. strain SGM16, Agrobacterium sp. strain SGM17, Pantoea sp. strain SGM18, Paraburkholderia sp. strain SGM19, and Pseudomonas sp. strain SGM20. Pseudomonas genus was dominant with eleven isolates. Morphological trait results showed that all isolates were gram-negative rod-shaped bacteria. Conclusion According to our understanding, this study revealed the first twenty endophytic bacteria isolated from Centella asiatica growing in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Data obtained in the current study will increase the knowledge of the already existing microbial diversity associated with Centella asiatica.

We investigated the fungal community succession across a gradient from bulk soil to the plant endosphere of diseased and healthy lisianthus plants using quantitative real-time PCR, amplicon sequencing, and metabolomics. Fungal diversity and richness gradually decreased from the bulk soil to root endosphere, and there were fewer fungi in the rhizosphere soil of diseased plants than healthy plants. While the rhizosphere fungal communities developed to be similar with that of the endosphere in both diseased and healthy plants from flowering to harvesting, the rhizosphere fungal community developed more quickly in diseased plants than healthy plants. More potential antifungal members were present in the bulk soil and rhizosphere of healthy plants, while potential pathogens were more prevalent in the diseased samples. There were significantly more F. oxysporum in the rhizosphere than the bulk soil, and the enrichment of F. oxysporum (i.e. Fusarium wilt pathogen) occurred more quickly in the rhizosphere of diseased plants than healthy plants. More importantly, the root relative electrical conductivity, the concentration of secreted short-chain organic acids like succinic and malic acids, and sugar alcohols were greater in diseased plants than healthy plants. These changes in plant physiology were associated with the faster development of the fungal community and more rapid increase in the pathogen population in the diseased rhizosphere. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of plant pathological condition for the assembly and development of fungal communities in plant-soil systems.",root,molecular; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Azúcar in Colombia,To Search,"The role of some Colletotrichum species is uncertain in crops of economic importance for Colombia such as mango (Mangifera indica L.) cv. Az & uacute;car. Eight Colletotrichum isolates from asymptomatic plant tissues were characterized by their pathogenicity on fruits and identified by phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of the ITS, GADPH, Tub2, CHs-1 and Act genomic regions. Colletotrichum asianum, C. gloeosporioides and C. tropicale of the C. gloeosporioides species complex and C. karstii of the C. boninense species complex were identified. The highest virulence was observed for isolates of C. asianum, that was the most prevalent species, and for C. tropicale, that showed high and intermediate virulence levels, indicating diversity in pathogenicity within the same species. The isolate of C. karstii, which displayed intermediate virulence, is the first report on mango in Colombia. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides presented intermediate virulence and was isolated at a low frequency in the present research. The mycelial growth rate did not show differences between species and ranged between 6.1 and 8.3 mm per day. Colletotrichum asianum recorded higher values of conidia germination and appressoria formation than other species, at 77% and 79%, respectively (p < 0.001). The shape and size of conidia did not vary between species. Appressoria exhibited different shapes between isolates and the largest average diameter was for C. karstii with 7.6 <mu>m (p < 0.001).

Tul. & C. Tul. fungal endophytes is often desirable because it confers enhanced insect tolerance to these plants. Determination of the viability of the endophytes in seed lots is important for commercial producers and consumers of seed. A current method of determining viability relies on staining leaf sheath epidermal peels for the presence of endophyte hyphae. It is difficult to obtain an epidermal peel from a young seedling, so plants must often be grown for several months before checking for viability. The objective of this study was to develop a method of screening very young seedlings for endophyte viability. Here it is reported that endophyte viability could be determined within 2 to 3 wk of germination by staining intact leaf sheath tissue with an alkaline rose bengal stain. This method of endophyte detection allows a more rapid assessment of percentage of viable endophyte in a seed lot.",seed; leaf; sheath; leaf sheath,culture_based; microscopy,NA,NA,NA,NA

We examined whether systemic fungal endophytes modulate recycling of nutrients directly by altering litter decomposition. We studied litter decomposition mediated by Epichloe endophytes in litter-bag experiments. We examined direct endophyte effects on litter decomposition in wild populations and cultivars of Schedonorus phoenix and Schedonorus pratensis. In the first experiment, endophyte presence tended to increase litter decomposition rate in cultivars of the two grass species (S. phoenix and S. pratensis). However, in the second experiment plant origin had a stronger influence than endophyte symbiosis in S. phoenix. Interestingly, the initial level of alkaloids was associated positively with decomposition in S. phoenix populations. Characteristics associated with litter quality were not clearly related to either endophytes or decomposition rate. Our results suggest that endophytes can enhance litter breakdown but their role in nutrient cycling is far more complex depending on plant population origin.

Some strains produce the ergopeptine alkaloid ergovaline, which is implicated in livestock toxicoses caused by ingestion of endophyte-infected grasses. Cloning and analysis of a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) gene from Neotyphodium lolii revealed a putative gene cluster for ergovaline biosynthesis containing a single-module NRPS gene, lpsB, and other genes orthologous to genes in the ergopeptine gene cluster of Claviceps purpurea and the clavine cluster of Aspergillus fumigatus. Despite conservation of gene sequence, gene order is substantially different between the N. lolii, C. purpurea, and A. fumigatus ergot alkaloid gene clusters. Southern analysis indicated that the N. lolii cluster was linked with previously identified ergovaline biosynthetic genes dmaW and lpsA. The ergovaline genes are closely associated with transposon relics, including retrotransposons and autonomous and nonautonomous DNA transposons. All genes in the cluster were highly expressed in planta, but expression was very low or undetectable in mycelia from axenic culture.

Their diversity in symbiotic association with traditionally utilized medicinal plants of northeast India is scantly available. The present investigation assessed the genetic diversity of endophytic actinobacteria (n = 120) distributed around the root, stem, and leaf tissues of six selected medicinal plants (Emblica officinalis, Terminalia chebula, T. arjuna, Murraya koenigii, Rauwolfia serpentina, and Azadirachta indica) from three different protected areas of evergreen forest—the Gibbon Wildlife Sanctuary (GWS), the Kaziranga National Park (KNP), and the North East Ecological Park (NEEP) of Assam, India. The samples were collected in two seasons (summer and winter). The overall phylogenetic analysis showed significant genetic diversity with 18 distinct genera belonging to 12 families. Overall, the occurrence of Streptomyces genus was predominant across all three sampling sites (76.66%), in both the sampling season (summer and winter). Shannon’s and Simpson’s diversity estimates showed their presence at A. indica (1.496, 0.778), R. serpentina (1.470, 0.858), and E. officinalis (0.975, 0.353). Among the site sampled, GWS had the most diverse community of actinobacteria (Shannon = 0.86 and Simpson = 0.557). The isolates were antagonistically more active against the investigated plant pathogenic bacteria than fungal pathogens. Further analysis revealed the prevalence of polyketide synthase genes (PKS) type II (84%) and PKS type I (16%) in the genome of the antimicrobial isolates.

Husn.] crop is smaller than that provided by pea (Pisum sativum L.) in the Great Plains of America. Rotation crops and the specific cropping practices associated with them may impact soil fungal communities, which in turn could affect the productivity of subsequent crops. Two separate field experiments were carried out to test the effect of pea and chickpea crops and of foliar fungicide use in chickpea on the community of fungi hosted in the roots of a subsequent durum wheat crop. The fungal communities in the healthy and diseased roots of durum wheat at maturity were characterized using plate culture and PCR-based identification. The effect of cropping practices on root-associated fungal communities depended on root type and varied with year. Functionally important fungal taxa were affected by specific cropping practices. Endophytic fungal antagonists were less abundant after chickpea than after pea and after fungicide-treated chickpea than after untreated chickpea. The chickpea cultivar CDC Vanguard increased the abundance of highly virulent pathogens in durum wheat roots in comparison with the chickpea cultivar CDC Luna and pea. We conclude that the negative impact of chickpea on durum wheat yield could be due in part to an increase in fungal pathogens resulting from the suppression of endophytic fungal antagonists by chickpea.

Both positive and negative growth effects of endophytes have been documented in some forage crop cultivars. Because they utilize host photosynthates, it is hypothesized that endophytes would impart a growth cost to infected plants under extreme resource limitation. The potential costs of infection by the fungal endophyte Neotyphodium lolii to its host grass, L. perenne, were investigated in accessions from Italy, Turkey, Morocco and Tunisia, the native part of the host's range. Four to five infected (+E) genotypes of L. perenne per accession were cloned into ramets, and the endophyte exterminated from half of the ramets (-E). Six +E and six -E ramets per genotype were grown for 5 months in a nutrient-poor substrate (vermiculite) within temperature- and light-controlled growth chambers. Accession and genotype within accession affected dry mass. Endophyte infection significantly reduced root:shoot ratio and the proportion of the shoot that was alive and photosynthetic. Relative interaction intensity indexes were negative for most genotypes, indicating host-endophyte associations were mostly parasitic. However, there were significant infection by genotype interactions; thus, endophyte-mediated effects depend on particular host genotype-endophyte combinations. This research is one of the few that have documented costs to endophyte infection in a grass-endophyte symbiosis. This cost, manifested as reduced root:shoot ratio and photosynthetic shoot fraction, was evident for infected L. perenne growing under conditions of extremely poor substrate nutrient availability.

Underground processes are mainly altered through litter decomposition dynamics and roots exuding organic compounds that influence the underground biological processes. The effect of grass-endophyte symbiosis on soil physical, chemical, and biological properties and processes varies depending on the type of grass, endophyte strain, and soil type. The effects on the physical properties of soil mainly relate to soil structure, and the effects on soil chemical composition are mainly reflected in the changes to soil carbon and nitrogen. The effects on soil biology were mainly observed in soil fungi, gram-negative bacteria, and nematodes. In this paper we reviewed the responses of grass-endophyte symbiosis on soil properties and functions to elucidate the mechanisms of interactions between grasses and microorganisms in the host soil habitat and their functions, to generate new knowledge for the discovery and development of novel endophytic grass cultivars. The aims are to (1) elucidate the mechanism and function of interaction between symbionts and microorganisms in host soil habitats, (2) to identify and develop novel grass-endophytic fungi symbionts and (3) to utilize these to alter the soil microenvironment, providing a theoretical basis for the discovery and development of new grass-endophytic fungal symbionts and the use of new grass-endophytic fungi symbiosis to change the soil microenvironment. © 2019 Editorial Office of Pratacultural Science.

Both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and microbial seed endophytes have been demonstrated to influence, directly or indirectly, biotic or abiotic soil properties, thus affecting subsequent plant growth, and community structure. However, little is known about how plant endophyte communities, individually or in interaction with AMF, affect plant-soil feedback processes. Here, we investigated, through a manipulative experiment, the behavior of endophyte-free and endophyte-associated Trifolium repens plants grown in soils previously conditioned by conspecific endophyte-free and endophyte-associated plants, inoculated or not by Rhizophagus intraradices. Furthermore, we identified microbial endophytes directly from the inner tissues of seeds by high-throughput sequencing, to compare seed fungal and bacterial endophyte composition. Results demonstrated that the outcome of simultaneous occurrence of seed endophytes and AMF on plant behavior depended on matching the endophytic status, i.e., either the presence or absence of seed microbial endophytes, of the conditioning and response phase. Seed fungal endophytes generated strong conspecific negative feedback, while seed bacterial endophytes proved to shift the feedback from negative to positive. Moreover, the simultaneous occurrence of both seed endophytes with AMF could either generate or expand negative plant-soil feedback effects. Our results show that seed and root symbionts can play a significant role on setting conspecific plant-soil feedback.",mycorrhizal; seed; root,molecular; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

We investigated the potential consequences of these ecological interactions on the assembly process of root-associated fungi by examining the co-occurrence of pairs of fungi in host-plant individuals. Based on massively-parallel pyrosequencing, we analyzed the root-associated fungal community composition for each of the 249 Quercus serrata and 188 Quercus glauca seedlings sampled in a warm-temperate secondary forest in Japan. Pairs of fungi that co-occurred more or less often than expected by chance were identified based on randomization tests. The pyrosequencing analysis revealed that not only ectomycorrhizal fungi but also endophytic fungi were common in the root-associated fungal community. Intriguingly, specific pairs of these ectomycorrhizal and endophytic fungi showed spatially aggregated patterns, suggesting the existence of facilitative interactions between fungi in different functional groups. Due to the large number of fungal pairs examined, many of the observed aggregated/segregated patterns with very low P values (e.g., < 0.005) turned non-significant after the application of a multiple comparison method. However, our overall results imply that the community structures of ectomycorrhizal and endophytic fungi could influence each other through interspecific competitive/facilitative interactions in root. To test the potential of host-plants' control of fungus-fungus ecological interactions in roots, we further examined whether the aggregated/segregated patterns could vary depending on the identity of host plant species. Potentially due to the physiological properties shared between the congeneric host plant species, the sign of hosts' control was not detected in the present study. The pyrosequencing-based randomization analyses shown in this study provide a platform of the high-throughput investigation of fungus-fungus interactions in plant root systems.",mycorrhizal; root,molecular; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this context, the current study was designed to evaluate the bioactive properties of endophytic fungi from the Mokrza & nacute;ski forest in Wroc & lstrok;aw, Poland that have not yet been fully researched. Forty-three endophytic fungi were isolated from twelve distinct plants. Following their cultivation, fungal extracts were separately prepared from biomass and cell-free filtrates, and their antibacterial, antifungal (against human and plant pathogens), and antioxidant properties were examined. Five promising fungi after screening were identified to possess all of these activities. These strains and their respective plant hosts were Trichoderma harzianum BUK-T (Fagus sylvatica), Aspergillus ochraceus ROB-L1 (Robinia pseudoacacia), Chaetomium cochliodes KLON-L1, Fusarium tricinctum KLON-L2 (Acer platanoides), and Penicillium chrysogenum SOS-B2 (Pinus sylvestris). Moreover, gamma irradiation at several doses (Gy) was separately applied to the fungal cultures to study their effects on the recorded activities.

Sorokin can grow endophytically in crops such as tomato, often inhibiting the growth of pests and diseases. Different isolates of M. anisopliae vary in their protective properties and require careful assessment prior to their use in any application. We evaluated isolates WEU01 and WEU02 of M. anisopliae for their ability to colonize tomato plants, promote plant growth, suppress spider mites, and inhibit black spot infections caused by Alternaria alternata. Both fungal isolates grew systemically within tomato plants, persisted in plant vegetative tissues for up to eight weeks, reduced spider mite populations, and were antagonistic to A. alternata in vitro and in planta. After four weeks, endophytic M. anisopliae positively affected leaf area, leaf number, stem length, stem diameter, dry weight, and chlorophyl content. These results illustrate the potential benefits of endophytic M. anisopliae for biological control of pests and diseases on tomato. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",leaf; stem,culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

AM fungal diversity was also compared among the different sites. Forty-four of the 50 grasses examined had AM association and dual association with DSE fungi occurred in 25 grasses. We report for the first time AM and DSE fungal status in 23 and 27 grasses respectively. Arum-type AM morphology was the dominant occurring in 21 grasses with typical Paris-type colonization occurring in 6 grasses. AM morphology is reported for the first time in 35 grasses. Over the different sites, spore density in the soil ranged from 5-22 per 100 g air-dried soil. Spores of 11 AM fungal taxa were isolated from the soil samples of grasses of which nine belonged to Glomus, one to Acaulospora and one to Scutellospora. No significant relationship existed between AM fungal colonization and spore numbers. Species richness was high in site II and Glomus aggregatum, Glomus viscosum and Glomus mosseae were most frequent species at different sites.

A Mycena in the citrinomarginata complex was observed to tightly co-occur with bunchgrasses at several prairie study sites. Mapping and spatial statistics showed that it was strongly and significantly associated with Festuca roemeri tussocks. We further found that this fungus is attached to F. roemeri roots (17/17 examined) and both specific primers and next-generation DNA sequencing established that the fungus is in the roots, suggesting that M. citrinomarginata may be endophytic or biotrophic in some contexts, and not simply saprotrophic. These results combined with a literature review indicate that Mycena species are often found as endophytes in grass roots.

In low-nutrient, primary successional systems such as sand dunes, N enrichment may alter the trajectory of plant community assembly or the dominance of foundational, ecosystem-engineering plants. Predicting the consequences of N enrichment may be complicated by plant interactions with microbial symbionts because increases in a limiting resource, such as N, could alter the costs and benefits of symbiosis. To evaluate the direct and interactive effects of microbial symbiosis and N addition on plant succession, we established a long-term field experiment in Michigan, USA, manipulating the presence of the symbiotic fungal endophyte Epichloe amarillans in Ammophila breviligulata, a dominant ecosystem-engineering dune grass species. From 2016 to 2020, we implemented N fertilization treatments (control, low, high) in a subset of the long-term experiment. N addition suppressed the accumulation of plant diversity over time mainly by reducing species richness of colonizing plants. However, this suppression occurred only when the endophyte was present in Ammophila. Although Epichloe enhanced Ammophila tiller density over time, N addition did not strongly interact with Epichloe symbiosis to influence vegetative growth of Ammophila. Instead, N addition directly altered plant community composition by increasing the abundance of efficient colonizers, especially C-4 grasses. In conclusion, hidden microbial symbionts can alter the consequences of N enrichment on plant primary succession.",NA,molecular; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

We analysed Illumina-generated ITS1 sequences from the needle mycobiome of white spruce (Picea glauca) at the northern treeline in Alaska (USA). Sequences were obtained from the same DNA that was used for tree genotyping. In the present study, fungal metabarcoding and tree microsatellite data were compared for the first time. In general, neighbouring trees shared more fungal taxa with each other than trees growing in further distance. Mycobiomes correlated strongly with phenological host traits and local habitat characteristics contrasting a dense forest stand with an open treeline site. Genetic similarity between trees did not influence fungal composition and no significant correlation existed between needle mycobiome and tree genotype. Our results suggest the pronounced influence of local habitat conditions and phenotypic tree traits on needle-inhabiting fungi. By contrast, the tree genetic identity cannot be benchmarked as a dominant driver for needle-inhabiting mycobiomes, at least not for white spruce in this extreme environment.",NA,molecular; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Phyllosphere interactions are known to influence a variety of tree canopy community members, but less frequently have they been shown to affect processes across ecosystem boundaries. Here, we show that a fungal endophyte (Rhytisma punctatum) slows leaf litter decomposition of a dominant riparian tree species (Acer macrophyllum) in an adjacent stream ecosystem. 2. Patches of leaf tissue infected by R. punctatum show significantly slower decomposition compared to both nearby uninfected tissue from the same leaf, and completely uninfected leaves. These reduced rates of decomposition existed despite 50% greater nitrogen in infected tissues and may be driven by slower rates of decomposition for fungal tissues themselves or by endophyte-hyphomycete interactions. 3. Across a temperate forest in the Pacific Northwest, approximately 72% of all A. macrophyllum leaves were infected by R. punctatum. Since R. punctatum infection can influence leaf tissue on entire trees and large quantities of leaf litter at the landscape scale, this infection could potentially result in a mosaic of 'cold spots' of litter decomposition and altered nutrient cycling in riparian zones where this infection is prevalent.",canopy; leaf; scale,plant_microbe_interaction,NA,NA,NA,NA

Effects of particular species of endophytic fungi on adaptation of N. caerulescens to excess Ni were tested by co-cultivation with single strains of the fungi. Seven of these had a positive effect on plant biomass production, whereas two of the tested species inhibited plant growth: biomass production of inoculated plants was significantly different compared to non-inoculated control. Inoculation with six fungal strains: Embellisia thlaspis, Pyrenochaeta cam Phomopsis columnaris, Plectosphaerella cucumerina, Cladosporium cladosporioides and Alternaria sp. stimulated the plant to uptake and accumulate more Ni in both roots and shoots, compared to non-inoculated control. P. columnaris was isolated from all plant species sampled. Strains isolated from Noccaea caerulescens and Noccaea goesingensis increased Ni root and shoot accumulation of their native hosts (compared to non-inoculated control). Inoculation of different populations of Noccaea with P. columnaris of foreign origin did not cause its host to accumulate more Ni, with the exception of the Ni-unadapted ecotype of N. goesingensis. Inoculation with P. columnaris from N. caerulescens significantly improved Ni uptake, but the effect of the fungus was not as prominent as in the case of N. caerulescens. By comparing the transcriptomes of N. caerulescens and N. goesingensis from Flatz inoculated with P. columnaris, we showed that enhanced uptake and accumulation of Ni in the plants is accompanied by an upregulation of several genes mainly involved in plant stress protection and metal uptake and compartmentation.

Their content in potentially toxic elements (PTE) represents an environmental risk. In the tailings, pioneer plant communities are established, associated with a determined diversity of fungi; plants, and fungi are fundamental in the natural rehabilitation of mining wastes. The objective was to evaluate the impact of the natural establishment of two plant species on the microbial activity, on the composition of the fungal community, and on the mitigation of the effect of PTE in a contaminated mine tailing. In a tailing, we selected three sites: one non-vegetated; one vegetated by Reseda luteola, and one vegetated by Asphodelus fistulosus. In the substrates, we conducted a physical and chemical characterization; we evaluated the enzymatic activity, the mineralization of the carbon, and the concentration of PTE. We also determined the fungal diversity in the substrates and in the interior of the roots, and estimated the accumulation of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and PTE in plant tissues. The tailings had a high percentage of sand; the non-vegetated site presented the highest electric conductivity, and the plant cover reduced the concentration of PTE in the substrates. Plants increased the carbon content in tailings. The enzymatic activities of beta-glucosidase and dehydrogenase, and the mineralization of carbon were highest at the site vegetated with A. fistulosus. Both plant species accumulated PTE in their tissues and exhibited potential in the phytoremediation of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and copper (Cu). Fungal diversity was more elevated at the vegetated sites than in the bare substrate. Ascomycota prevailed in the substrates; the substrates and the plants shared some fungal taxa, but other taxa were specific. The plant coverage and the rhizosphere promoted the natural attenuation and a rehabilitation of the extreme conditions of the mining wastes, modulated by the plant species. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

E. Br,To Search,"Endophytes are primarily endosymbiotic bacteria and fungi that colonize the interior tissues of their host plant. They enhance the host plant's growth and attenuate adverse effects of biological stress. Endophytic species of many indigenous plants are an untapped resource of plant growth-promoting microorganisms that can mitigate abiotic stress effects. Thus, this study aimed to isolate endophytes from the roots and leaves of the medicinal plant Endostemon obtusifolius to evaluate their in vitro growth-promoting capacities and drought tolerance and to characterize the most promising species. Twenty-six endophytes (fourteen bacteria and twelve fungi) were isolated and cultured from the roots and leaves of E. obtusifolius. All 26 endophytes produced flavonoids, and 14 strains produced phenolic compounds. Of the 11 strains that displayed good free radical scavenging capability (low IC50) in the 1-1-diphenyl-1-picryhydrazyl radical scavenging assay, only three strains could not survive the highest drought stress treatment (40% polyethylene glycol). These 11 strains were all positive for ammonia and siderophore production and only one strain failed to produce hydrogen cyanide and solubilize phosphate. Seven isolates showed aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase activity and differentially synthesized indole-3-acetic acid. Using molecular tools, two promising symbiotic, drought stress tolerant, and plant growth-enhancing endophytic species (EORB-2 and EOLF-5) were identified as Paenibacillus polymyxa and Fusarium oxysporum. The results of this study demonstrate that P. polymyxa and F. oxysporum should be further investigated for their drought stress mitigation and plant growth enhancement effects as they have the potential to be developed for use in sustainable agricultural practices.",root; leaf,culture_based; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Currently, increasing anthropogenic disturbances and improper forest management are affecting subtropical forests of China where these native species located. These activities not only affect plant communities above-ground, but also impose pressures on microbial communities below- ground. In this study, root-associated fungal communities of Rhododendron simsii in four forest types under different anthropogenic disturbances were identified using an Illumina Miseq platform, i.e., old growth forests, secondary forests with one cutting (SEC I), secondary forests with two cuttings (SEC II), and Chinese-fir plantations (PLF). Intra- and inter-annual variations were analyzed by comparing samples taken in different seasons and years. The results show that: (1) over 1000 OTUs were found in hair roots with most from the division Ascomycota and Basidiomycota belonging to different functional groups; (2) while there were a few indicator OTUs specific to different forest types, seasons and years, the proportion of shared taxa was quite large, accounting for 44.9-79.4% of the total OTUs; (3) significantly positive correlations were found between disturbance sensitivity and temporal variations in common fungal orders, and both in major fungal orders were significantly different among fungal functional groups in which putative and possible ERM fungi were highly resistant to disturbances and low temporal variations.

Many fungal endophytes produce secondary metabolites and some of these compounds exhibit antifungal and antibacterial activity that strongly inhibits the growth of other microorganisms. Antimicrobial strains are widely distributed among endophytic fungi and do not cause any obvious symptoms on host plants. Infected hosts usually grow quickly, have strong resistance to adverse conditions and diseases, and are immune to herbivory in comparison with uninfected plants. Endophyte-infected plants thus have competitive advantage. Endophytes act as biological control agents by inhibiting pathogen growth by the production of antibiotics, hydrolases, plant growth regulators and alkaloids. They also compete with pathogens for nutrition, enhancing resistance of host plants to diseases and inducing systemic resistance. Endophytic fungi are therefore biological control agents with great potential for applied use. We investigated the antimicrobial properties of an endophytic fungus Chaetomium globosum L18 from a traditional Chinese medicinal plant Curcuma wenyujin Y. H. Chen et C. Ling (Zingiberaceae), on several conventional plant pathogens, using in vitro culturing methods. We thus present a preliminary discussion of the antimicrobial spectrum and antagonistic mechanisms of Chaetomium globosum L18. This fungus had different inhibitory actions on plant pathogenic fungi and bacteria, and wide-ranging inhibitory effects. There was significant difference (P<0. 05) on inhibition of different plant pathogenic bacteria; and the inhibition rate was up to 92. 9%. Our inhibition experiment showed that competition and mycoparasitism were the main antagonistic mechanisms. When two strains intersected with pathogenic fungi on co-culturing plates, plant pathogens were surrounded, and the margins of colonies gradually collapsed and shriveled. The pathogens stopped growing and began to die; and Chaetomium globosum L18 colonized the nutritious space. Chaetomium globosum L18 parasitized pathogens by parallel intergrowth, intertwining, and even penetrating their mycelia. Our fermented product test showed that Chaetomium globosum L18 was able to strongly inhibit mycelial growth and spore germination. Its presence resulted in mycelia that were twisted and inflated, with increased abnormal branching, broken mycelial walls, and cell contents released. Spores were reduced in number and deformed; germination rate and germination tube length were decreased.",NA,culture_based; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; physiological_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Our objective was to determine the effect of endophyte infection on the competitive ability of Festuca rubra in binary mixtures against other grassland species. In two glasshouse experiments, endophyte-infected (E+) and non-infected (E-) plants of two half-sib lines (PEN, RAB) of Festuca rubra were grown in monocultures and in binary mixtures against five grassland species: Trifolium repens, Trifolium pratense, Trifolium subterraneum, Lotus corniculatus and Plantago lanceolata. Biomass production of F.rubra was affected by endophyte infection and plant line but not by competition with T.pratense. In the PEN line E+ plants produced less root biomass than E-; and in the RAB line E+ plants produced less shoot biomass than E-. In spite of these differences shoot and root biomass production of Trifolium pratense were more inhibited when growing with endophyte-infected plants of Festuca rubra than with E- plants, regardless of the plant line. In both F.rubra lines, the endophyte increased the phosphorus concentration in shoots. Regardless of F.rubra plant line, root biomass of the five target species was more inhibited when growing with endophyte-infected than with endophyte-free plants. Irrespective of F.rubra line, endophyte-infected plants had a better competitive ability than non-infected plants, as indicated by the lower relative yield of companion plants when growing in mixture with E+ plants.

An exudate fraction from the fungus induces rapid and transient cytoplasmic Ca2+ elevation in the roots. The Ca2+ response does not require the well-characterized (co)receptors BAK1, CERK1, and FLS2 for pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and the Ca2+ channels GLR-2.4, GLR-2.5, and GLR-3.3 or the vacuolar TWO PORE CHANNEL1, which might be involved in cytoplasmic Ca2+ elevation. We isolated an ethyl-methane-sulfonate-induced Arabidopsis mutant that is impaired in this Ca2+ response. The roots of the mutant are impaired in M. hyalina-mediated suppression of immune responses after Alternaria brassicae infection, i.e., jasmonate accumulation, generation of reactive oxygen species, as well as the activation of jasmonate-related defense genes. Furthermore, they are more colonized by M. hyalina than wild-type roots.

The antifungal activities of the endophytes towards Ganoderma boninense (GB) were first established using the dual culture test, revealing antagonistic nature of endophytes via production of nonvolatiles, volatiles and competitive exclusion. Endophyte-host compatibility was then assessed using a simple but rapid endophyte-calli dual-culture assay, and results validated using endophyte-ramet test. Results revealed that endophytes elicited different responses in oil palm calli. BTF08 had growth promoting effects towards the host tissues with the highest calli weight (1013 mg) obtained, while BTF07 appeared to inhibit calli (1006 mg) leading to browning and necrosis. This endophyte-calli test also revealed the influence of calli on endophyte growth. Isolates BTF08 and GB benefited from host association, with increased radial growth (2.36 cm and 2.31 cm, respectively) compared to growth in the absence of calli (2.10 cm and 2.15 cm, respectively). Endophytes and GB were also isolated from host tissues, suggesting compatibility and ability to colonize host tissues (root, stem, leaf). This suggested the reliability of the endophyte-calli test as a rapid assay to provide an insight on the endophyte-host compatibility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Although Mongolia is rich in medicinal plants, due to climatic and anthropogenic reasons, the resources are being depleted, and many species are under threat of gradual extinction, while the endophytic fungi of Mongolian plants are largely unknown. In this study, a total of 24 culturable endophytic fungal strains were isolated from Cynomorium songaricum (Rupr.), a medicinal and vulnerable plant species of Mongolia. Based on the morphological characteristics and the sequences of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the isolates were identified into six genera: Fusarium (8), Clonostachys (7), Penicillium (6), Alternaria (1), Aspergillus (1), and Madurella (1).

Bacterial blight and panicle blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (KACC 10208) and Burkholderia glumae (KACC 44022), respectively, were also suppressed effectively by drenching a bacterial suspension (10(7) cfu/ml) of strain YC7007 on the rhizosphere of rice. Additionally, strain YC7007 promoted the growth of rice seedlings with higher germination rates and more tillers than the untreated control. The taxonomic position of the strains was also investigated. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that both strains belong to the genus Bacillus, with high similarity to the closely related strains, Bacillus siamensis KACC 15859(T) (99.67%), Bacillus methylotrophicus KACC 13105(T) (99.65%), Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum KACC 17177(T) (99.60%), and Bacillus tequilensis KACC 15944(T) (99.45%). The DNA-DNA relatedness value between strain YC7010T and the most closely related strain, B. siamensis KACC 15859(T) was 50.4 +/- 3.5%, but it was 91.5 +/- 11.0% between two strains YC7007 and YC7010T, indicating the same species. The major fatty acids of two strains were anteiso-C-15:0 and iso C-15:0. Both strains contained MK-7 as a major respiratory quinone system. The G+C contents of the genomic DNA of two strains were 50.5 mol% and 51.2 mol%, respectively. Based on these polyphasic studies, the two strains YC7007 and YC7010T represent novel species of the genus Bacillus, for which the name Bacillus oryzicola sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is YC7010(T) (= KACC 18228(T)). Taken together, our findings suggest that novel endophytic Bacillus strains can be used for the biological control of rice diseases.",root; panicle,molecular; culture_based; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

We investigate the beneficial interaction between the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica. Recently, we showed that ET signalling and ETH YLENE RESPON SE FACTOR (ERF)1 are important to balance beneficial and nonbeneficial traits in this symbiosis. 147 ERF genes in Arabidopsis encode transcriptional regulators with a variety of functions involved in development, physiological processes as well as plant/ microbe interactions. In the beneficial symbiosis between Arabidopsis and P. indica, overexpression of ERF1 activates defence responses, strongly reduces root colonization and thus abolishes the benefits for the plants. Here we show that additional transcription factors of the ERF family, the ERF DOM AIN PROT EIN 9 (ERF9) and the ETH YLENE-RESPON SIVE ELEMENT BIN DIN G FACTOR 14 (ERF14) are involved in the interaction between the two symbionts and are required for growth promotion of the host plant. Expression of these genes is upregulated in colonized wild-type roots. Insertional inactivation of ERF9 and ERF14 diminishes the P. indica-induced growth promotion and activates the expression of the PATHOGENESIS-RELATED (PR)-1 and PR-2 genes. We propose that ERF9 and ERF14 repress PR gene expression in colonized Arabidopsis roots and thus contribute to the establishment of a beneficial interaction. © 2010 Landes Bioscience.",root,microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays,NA,NA,NA,NA

Their vertical transmission (seed-plant-seed) has been well described and documented. However, horizontal transmission (plant-plant) needs more clarification. The aim of this study was to assess the extent to which endophytes move vertically in ecotypes of perennial ryegrass and whether there is evidence for the horizontal transmission of endophytes. Ecotypes from grasslands in Poland were collected in the form of living plants and used for vertical transmission analysis. Plants, the seed collected from these plants and plants grown from this collected seed were tested for endophytic infection. Provided that all produced seeds were viable and able to germinate and produce seedlings, the vertical transmission of Neotyphodium endophytes in perennial ryegrass ecotypes was nearly complete. For the horizontal transmission experiment, endophyte-hosting plants (E+) and endophyte-free plants (E-) of four cultivars were planted in the field in close proximity on small plots that were frequently mown. These studies revealed that after 7 months of growth next to E+ plants, the characteristic Neotyphodium spp. mycelia were found in E- plants, which was especially true for plants growing in close proximity to the infected plants. The occurrence of horizontal transmission of endophytes has not been previously demonstrated.",seed,culture_based; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study explored the isolation and identification of fungal endophytes, and investigated the antibacterial and antimycobacterial activity of their crude extracts. Fungal endophytes were isolated from Solanum mauritianum, identified using morphological traits and internal transcribed spacer ribosomal-deoxyribonucleic acid (ITS-rDNA) sequence analysis. Eight fungal endophytes were identified as Aureobasidium pullulans, Paracamarosporium leucadendri, Cladosporium sp., Collectotrichum boninense, Fusarium sp., Hyalodendriella sp., and Talaromyces sp., while Penicillium chrysogenum was isolated from the leaves and unripe fruits. Good activity was observed for the crude extracts of Paracamarosporium leucadendri inhibiting Mycobacterium bovis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 6 mu g/mL. Crude extracts of Fusarium sp., showed activity at 9 mu g/mL against M. bovis, M. smegmatis and K. pneumonia. In general, the crude extracts showed great activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and novel results for two mycobacteria species M. bovis and M. smegmatis.

Predicting fungal symbiont distributions under future climates first requires knowledge of current distributions and their potential drivers. LocationWe documented colonization by fungal symbionts in perennial, cool-season grasses along altitudinal gradients in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA. MethodsAcross seven replicate altitudinal gradients, spanning c.1400 vertical meters, we scored fungal colonization for 46 grass species. We documented altitudinal clines in colonization by both above-ground and below-ground fungal symbionts for the first time, including localized foliar endophytes (LFE) and systemic endophytes (epichloae) in leaves and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) in roots. For a subset of 16 well-sampled grass species, we used model selection procedures to evaluate the relative importance of geography, edaphic factors and host plant identity. We also assessed the influence of host phylogenetic relatedness and colonization by co-infecting fungi. ResultsLevels of fungal colonization varied strongly with host plant identity, but the effects of particular host species were not consistent across fungal groups. In addition to the influence of host identity, epichloae colonization declined with elevation and varied with geography (latitude/longitude) and edaphic factors. Geography and collection date were important predictors of LFE colonization, with higher colonization later in the growing season. Colonization estimates for the obligately plant-associated fungi (epichloae, AMF) were phylogenetically conserved across the grass supertree. Positive correlations between AMF and DSE, which remained even after accounting for host plant relatedness, suggested possible synergisms between these fungal groups. Main conclusionsOur survey showed greater host specificity in patterns of fungal colonization than prior reports and revealed that different fungal symbiont groups do not share similar drivers. Conserving plant-fungal symbioses under future climates may require unique strategies for different plant species and fungal symbiont types.",leaf; mycorrhizal; root,molecular; microscopy; inoculation; plant_microbe_interaction; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

To characterize the fungal communities that inhabit the tissues of this species, a total of 550 endophytic fungi were isolated, of which 212 were from native trees located in the state of Acre and 338 in the state of Amazonas. These fungi were grouped into 115 OTUs. The phylum Ascomycota was dominant (93%) and the most abundant isolates belonged to the families Glomerallaceae (genusColletotrichum), Diaporthaceae (genusDiaporthe), Nectriaceae (genusFusarium), Hypocreaceae (genusTrichoderma), and Trichocomaceae (genusPenicillium). The diversity and richness of fungi in the state of Acre did not differ significantly between leaves, stems, and roots; however, in the state of Amazonas, the diversity was greater in the stems and roots than in the leaves. In general, the diversity of endophytic fungi was greater in the state of Acre. Comparisons between communities of fungi showed more differences between those that inhabit different tissues than in different states. Furthermore, the fungal communities of roots and stems were similar, and both these were dissimilar from leaves.

In our study, we focused on the detailed characterization of multiple isolates tentatively placed into the genera Nothophaeocryptopus and Rhizosphaera that were obtained from needles of Sitka spruce and co-occurring Norway spruce (Picea abies) and Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) at four sites in Scotland and Wales. After a thorough analysis of their phenotype and analysis of two nuclear regions (ITS rDNA and gene for beta-tubulin), we propose two species new to science and one new combination. Nothophaeocryptopus piceae was isolated from healthy green or brown needles from spruces and is currently known only as a sterile culture, but the taxonomic novelty is well supported by host affinity and results of molecular data analysis. Rhizosphaera minteri may also be distinguished based on the combination of host and molecular data, but morphologically, it is similar to R. pini. Finally, Hormonema merioides and R. pseudotsugae are found to be conspecific and a new combination R. merioides is proposed following the phylogenetic placement of this species. Our study highlights the importance of multiple approaches used in the identification of microfungi associated with coniferous needles.

Therefore, the present study aims to identify secondary metabolites, produced by the endophytic fungi isolated from the roots of Taxus wallichiana. Additionally, biological activities, namely antioxidant and antibacterial activity, are also evaluated. Five endophytic fungi i.e., GBPITWR_F1 (Penicillium sp.), GBPITWR_F1 (P. daleae), GBPITWR_F1 (Penicillium sp.), GBPITWR_F1 (Aspergillus versicolor), and GBPITWR_F1 (Aspergillus sp.), isolated from T. wallichiana roots, were used. Extraction of bioactive metabolites was done by maceration methods in four different solvents- hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol in sequential manner. These crude organic extracts were tested for phytochemicals and antioxidant and antibacterial activity. Results revealed the tendency of endophytic fungi to accumulate various bioactive compounds. Gallic acid was found maximum in GBPITWR_F5 (18.35 +/- 2.65 mg/g), quercetin higher in GBPITWR_F1 (15.24 +/- 2.28 mg/g); taxol content was present in two of the endophytes i.e., GBPITWR_F1 (0.31 +/- 0.00 mg/g) and GBPITWR_F (5 0.68 +/- 0.00 mg/g). All the endophytes exhibited production of seven important organic acids i.e., ascorbic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, mallic acid, oxalic acid, pyruvic acid, and succinic acid.

However, several pests affect this crop, and one of the primary control strategies is the symbiotic relationships between ryegrass endophyte fungi. This fungus produces alkaloids that exhibit toxic activity against arthropods. Furthermore, the effect of fungi may extend to higher trophic levels, including predators (spiders and/or insects), decreasing their abundance and diversity. Given the importance of spiders and insects as predators, whether the symbiotic interaction between perennial ryegrass and endophyte fungus reduces the abundance and diversity of predators pose an important question. To address this question, natural enemies in perennial ryegrass were collected and analyzed over a year, and the percentage of endophyte fungus was evaluated by the presence of hyphae from two ryegrass cultivars, Jumbo (E-) and Alto AR1 (E+). We observed an 80% endophyte infection rate for (E+) and 0% for (E-). Moreover, 222 individual spiders corresponding to 10 families were identified in both perennial ryegrasses, including 209 individuals for (E-) and 13 for (E+). The most abundant spider family was Lycosidae, representing 71.17% of the total spiders. In addition, 65 insects were collected, corresponding to 6 families, with Carabidae being the most abundant. Furthermore, the Simpson index indicated the dominance of the family Lycosidae.

Development of a specific, rapid and sensitive technique that allows accurately determining the process and factors leading to the establishment of this strain in opium poppy plants would be essential to achieve its efficient control in a large field scale. For that purpose in the present study, species-specific primers that can be used in conventional or quantitative PCR protocols were developed for specifically identification and detection of B. bassiana in plant tissues. The combination of the designed BB.fw/BB.rv primer set with the universal ITS1-F/ITS4 primer set in a two-step nested-PCR approach, has allowed the amplification of up to 10 fg of B. bassiana. This represented an increase in sensitivity of 10000- and 1000-fold of detection than when using the BB.fw/BB.rv primers in a single or single-tube semi-nested PCR approaches, respectively. The BB.fw and BB.rv primer set were subsequently optimized to be used in real time quantitative PCR assays and allowed to accurately quantify B. bassiana DNA in different plant DNA backgrounds (leaves and seeds) without losing accuracy and efficiency. The qPCR protocol was used to monitor the endophytic colonization of opium poppy leaves byB. bassiana after inoculation with the strain EABb 04/01-Tip, detecting as low as 26 fg of target DNA in leaves and a decrease in fungal biomass over time. PCR quantification data were supported in parallel with CLMS by the monitoring of spatial and temporal patterns of leaf and stem colonization using a GFP-tagged transformant of the B. bassiana EABb 04/01-Tip strain, which enabled to demonstrate that B. bassiana effectively colonizes aerial tissues of opium poppy plants mainly through intercellular spaces and even leaf trichomes. A decline in endophytic colonization was also observed by the last sampling times, i.e. from 10 to 15 days after inoculation, although fungal structures still remained present in the leaf tissues. These newly developed molecular protocols should facilitate the detection, quantification and monitoring of endophytic B. bassiana strains in different tissues and host plants and would help to unravel the factors and process governing the specific endophytic association between opium poppy and strain EABb 04/01-Tip providing key insights to formulate a sustainable strategy for I. luteipes management in the host.

Endophytes are recognised as a rich source of secondary metabolites with potentially useful pharmacological properties. Many South African medicinal plants are highly under-investigated sources of potentially useful endophytic microbes. In this report six endophytic fungi were obtained from the leaves, stems and roots of South African medicinal plants which are known for their traditional uses and pharmacological properties. The endophytic fungi were isolated from Cotyledon orbiculata L., Psychotria zombamontana (Kuntze) Petit, Tecomaria capensis (Thunb.) Lindl., Catha edulis (Vahl) Endl. and Melianthus comosus Vahl. The crude extracts of the isolated endophytic fungi were investigated for their antimicrobial potential, extracellular enzymatic activity and phosphate solubilization. Additionally, the present study used genetic screening to assess the ability of the endophytic fungi to synthesize bioactive compounds, indicated by the presence of the polyketide synthase type 1 (PKS 1) gene. In preliminary microbial inhibition screening the fungal extracts had promising antifungal activity against Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans. Furthermore, the endophytic fungus Talaromyces funiculosus displayed extracellular enzymatic activity, namely xylanase and cellulase. Five fungal strains demonstrated ability to solubilize phosphate and three strains demonstrated the presence of polyketide synthase type 1 (PKS 1) gene.

CWRs have been recognised as potential reservoirs of beneficial traits for our domesticated crops, and with mounting evidence of the importance of the microbiome to organismal health, it follows that the microbial communities of wild relatives could also be a valuable resource for crop resilience to environmental and pathogenic threats. Endophytic fungi reside asymptomatically inside all plant tissues and have been found to confer advantages to their plant host. Preserving the natural microbial diversity of plants could therefore represent an important secondary conservation role of seed banks. At the same time, species that are reported as endophytes may also be latent pathogens. We explored the potential of the MSB as an incidental fungal endophyte bank by assessing diversity of fungi inside stored seeds. Using banana CWRs in the genus Musa as a case-study, we sequenced an extended ITS-LSU fragment in order to delimit operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and used a similarity and phylogenetics approach for classification. Fungi were successfully detected inside just under one third of the seeds, with a few genera accounting for most of the OTUs-primarily Lasiodiplodia, Fusarium, and Aspergillus-while a large variety of rare OTUs from across the Ascomycota were isolated only once. Fusarium species were notably abundant-of significance in light of Fusarium wilt, a disease threatening global banana crops-and so were targeted for additional sequencing with the marker EF1 alpha in order to delimit species and place them in a phylogeny of the genus. Endophyte community composition, diversity and abundance was significantly different across habitats, and we explored the relationship between community differences and seed germination/viability. Our results show that there is a previously neglected invisible fungal dimension to seed banking that could well have implications for the seed collection and storage procedures, and that collections such as the MSB are indeed a novel source of potentially useful fungal strains.",seed,molecular; culture_based; microscopy; bioactivity_assays; ecological_studies,NA,NA,NA,NA

Antifungal activities of common thyme (Thymus vulgaris) essential oil were tested against endophytic fungi grown from wheat (Triticum aestivum) grain, molecularly identifi ed as Alternaria alternata, Alternaria infectoria, Aspergillus fl avus, Epicoccum nigrum and Fusarium poae. Their susceptibility to thyme essential oil was tested in vitro, and ranged from fungicidal to fungistatic. Treatment combinations of prior grain surface sterilization with hypochlorite and direct/indirect treatment with the essential oil were used, which showed strong effects on infection incidence and germination. Direct soaking of the wheat grain in the essential oil was particularly effective, but inhibited both fungal growth and seed germination. In contrast, indirect treatment of the grain with the essential oil (i.e., fumigation) inhibited fungal growth without negative effects on seed germination. In combination with grain surface sterilization with hypochlorite, indirect treatment with thyme essential oil reduced these fungal infections even more. Since thyme essential oil is safe for plants and consumers, in the form of fumigation it could be used as a protectant of storage containers for wheat grain intended for sowing and for food production.",seed,culture_based; bioactivity_assays; ecological_studies; surface_sterilization,NA,NA,NA,NA

The study concludes that agarwood is the product of persistent interaction between endogenous fungi and the plant, which triggers at early stage of its growth and the resin production probably is visible at onset of maturity.",stem; leaf,culture_based; microscopy; plant_microbe_interaction; bioactivity_assays; surface_sterilization,NA,NA,NA,NA
10.1016/j.foreco.2004.04.003,Püttsepp_2004.pdf,Ectomycorrhizal fungal communities associated with Salix viminalis L. and S. dasyclados Wimm. clones in a short-rotation forestry plantation,To Search,"Two willow clones, Salix viminalis L. and S. dasyclados Wimm., growing in separate blocks in mineral soil in one short-rotation forestry (SRF) plantation in Estonia, were analysed to compare the frequency, structure and species composition of ectomycorrhizal (EM) colonisation on their fine roots. Salix dasyclados had significantly greater EM colonisation on root tips (94%) than S. viminalis (75%). The development of EM and associated fungal structures in fine roots (Hartig net, mantle, Hartig net and mantle combined. surface hyphae, endophyte) was similar for both Salix clones. Nine groups of ectomycorrhizal tips were distinguished on the basis of morphological characterisation. Due to high variability among samples, no significant differences between the Salix clones could be found with respect to the abundance of these morphological groups. In total, nine fungal taxa were identified as fungal associates of the two Salix clones. Identification was based upon amplifying and sequencing the rDNA-ITS region of the fungal associates of the root tips. Phialophora finlandia was the most common fungal associate. Morphological groups with well-defined features (e.g., Tomentella sp.) showed limited taxonomic variation, while groups with ill-defined features contained wider taxonomic variation, including unrelated species (e.g., Laccaria sp., Hebeloma helodes). EM fungal diversity was low and largely comprised species considered as pioneer or early stage fungi. A tendency towards higher EM levels with higher N and organic matter concentrations, and low pH, P and K concentrations were observed when the mean levels of EM colonisation were compared with soil variables. It is suggested that EM colonisation level may be primarily determined by the tree species but that local soil nutrient status also influences colonisation. The quality of root litter produced by the Salix clones is known to differ and this may have a role in determining EM colonisation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.
