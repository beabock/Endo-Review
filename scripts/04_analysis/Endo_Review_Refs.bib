	abstract = {Plant-microbial interactions may play a key role in plant invasions. One common microbial interaction takes place between plants and fungal endophytes when fungi asymptomatically colonize host plant tissues. The objectives of this study were to isolate and sequence fungal endophytes colonizing non-native Phragmites australis in the Great Lakes region to evaluate variation in endophyte community composition among three host tissue types and three geographical regions. We collected entire ramets from multiple clones and populations, surface sterilized plant tissues, and plated replicate tissue samples from leaves, stems, and rhizomes on corn meal agar plates to culture and isolate fungal endophytes. Isolates were then subjected to Sanger sequencing of the {ITS} region of the nuclear ribosomal {DNA}. Sequences were compared to fungal databases to define operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}) that were analyzed statistically for community composition. In total, we obtained 173 endophyte isolates corresponding to 55 {OTUs}, 39 of which were isolated only a single time. The most common {OTU} corresponded most closely to Sarocladium strictum and comprised 25 \% of all fungal isolates. More {OTUs} were found in stem tissues, but endophyte diversity was greatest in rhizome tissues. {PERMANOVA} analyses indicated significant differences in endophyte communities among tissue types, geographical regions, and the interaction between those factors, but no differences among individual ramets were detected. The functional role of the isolated endophytes is not yet known, but one genus isolated here (Stagonospora) has been reported to enhance Phragmites growth. Understanding the diversity and functions of Phragmites endophytes may provide targets for control measures based on disrupting host plant/endophyte interactions.},

	abstract = {Fungal endophytes are ubiquitous fungi that inhabit healthy plant tissues without causing disease. Endophytes have been found in every plant species examined to date and may be important, but often overlooked, components of fungal biodiversity. In two sites in a lowland, moist tropical forest of central Panama, we quantified endophyte colonization patterns, richness, host preference, and spatial variation in healthy leaves of two co-occurring, understory tree species [Heisteria concinna (Olacaceae) and Ouratea lucens (Ochnaceae)]. From 83 leaves, all of which were colonized by endophytes, we isolated 418 endophyte morphospecies (estimated 347 genetically distinct taxa), most of which were represented by only a single isolate (59\%). Among morphospecies encountered in more than one leaf (nonsingletons), we found evidence of host preference and spatial heterogeneity using both morphospecies frequencies and presence/absence records. Based on these data, we postulate that tropical endophytes themselves may be hyperdiverse and suggest that extrapolative estimates that exclude them will markedly underestimate fungal species diversity.},

Over the past decades, rapid development and affordability of molecular tools have tremendously improved insights of the fungal diversity in all ecosystems and habitats. Yet, in spite of the progress of molecular methods, knowledge about functional properties of the fungal taxa is vague and interpretation of environmental studies in an ecologically meaningful manner remains challenging. In order to facilitate functional assignments and ecological interpretation of environmental studies we introduce a user friendly traits and character database {FungalTraits} operating at genus and species hypothesis levels. Combining the information from previous efforts such as {FUNGuild} and {FunFun} together with involvement of expert knowledge, we reannotated 10,210 and 151 fungal and Stramenopila genera, respectively. This resulted in a stand-alone spreadsheet dataset covering 17 lifestyle related traits of fungal and Stramenopila genera, designed for rapid functional assignments of environmental studies.},

	abstract = {The {GBIF} Backbone Taxonomy is a single, synthetic management classification with the goal of covering all names {GBIF} is dealing with. It's the taxonomic backbone that allows {GBIF} to integrate name based information from different resources, no matter if these are occurrence datasets, species pages, names from nomenclators or external sources like {EOL}, Genbank or {IUCN}. This backbone allows taxonomic search, browse and reporting operations across all those resources in a consistent way and to provide means to crosswalk names from one source to another. It is updated regulary through an automated process in which the Catalogue of Life acts as a starting point also providing the complete higher classification above families. Additional scientific names only found in other authoritative nomenclatural and taxonomic datasets are then merged into the tree, thus extending the original catalogue and broadening the backbones name coverage. The {GBIF} Backbone taxonomy also includes identifiers for Operational Taxonomic Units ({OTUs}) drawn from the barcoding resources {iBOL} and {UNITE}. International Barcode of Life project ({iBOL}), Barcode Index Numbers ({BINs}). {BINs} are connected to a taxon name and its classification by taking into account all names applied to the {BIN} and picking names with at least 80\% consensus. If there is no consensus of name at the species level, the selection process is repeated moving up the major Linnaean ranks until consensus is achieved. {UNITE} - Unified system for the {DNA} based fungal species, Species Hypotheses ({SHs}). {SHs} are connected to a taxon name and its classification based on the determination of the {RefS} (reference sequence) if present or the {RepS} (representative sequence). In the latter case, if there is no match in the {UNITE} taxonomy, the lowest rank with 100\% consensus within the {SH} will be used.

	abstract = {Fungi play major roles in ecosystem processes, but the determinants of fungal diversity and biogeographic patterns remain poorly understood. Using {DNA} metabarcoding data from hundreds of globally distributed soil samples, we demonstrate that fungal richness is decoupled from plant diversity. The plant-to-fungus richness ratio declines exponentially toward the poles. Climatic factors, followed by edaphic and spatial variables, constitute the best predictors of fungal richness and community composition at the global scale. Fungi show similar latitudinal diversity gradients to other organisms, with several notable exceptions. These findings advance our understanding of global fungal diversity patterns and permit integration of fungi into a general macroecological framework.

              Global metagenomics detects hotspots of fungal diversity and macroecological patterns and indicates that plant and fungal diversity are uncoupled.

            Assessing fungal diversity worldwide
            
              Fungi are hyperdiverse but poorly known, despite their ecological and economic impacts. Tedersoo
              et al.
              collected nearly 15,000 topsoil samples from 365 sites worldwide and sequenced their genomes (see the Perspective by Wardle and Lindahl). Overall, they found a striking decline in fungal species richness with distance from the equator. For some specialist groups though, diversity depended more on the abundance of host plants than host diversity or geography. The findings reveal a huge gap between known and described species and the actual numbers of distinct fungi in the world's soils.

              The question of how many species of
              Fungi
              there are has occasioned much speculation, with figures mostly posited from around half a million to 10 million, and in one extreme case even a sizable portion of the spectacular number of 1 trillion. Here we examine new evidence from various sources to derive an updated estimate of global fungal diversity. The rates and patterns in the description of new species from the 1750s show no sign of approaching an asymptote and even accelerated in the 2010s after the advent of molecular approaches to species delimitation. Species recognition studies of (semi-)cryptic species hidden in morpho-species complexes suggest a weighted average ratio of about an order of magnitude for the number of species recognized after and before such studies. New evidence also comes from extrapolations of plant:fungus ratios, with information now being generated from environmental sequence studies, including comparisons of molecular and fieldwork data from the same sites. We further draw attention to undescribed species awaiting discovery in biodiversity hot spots in the tropics, little-explored habitats (such as lichen-inhabiting fungi), and material in collections awaiting study. We conclude that the commonly cited estimate of 1.5 million species is conservative and that the actual range is properly estimated at 2.2 to 3.8 million. With 120,000 currently accepted species, it appears that at best just 8\%, and in the worst case scenario just 3\%, are named so far. Improved estimates hinge particularly on reliable statistical and phylogenetic approaches to analyze the rapidly increasing amount of environmental sequence data.},

Fossils preserved under exceptional conditions provide tantalizing glimpses into the evolutionary history of mycorrhizas, showing the extent of their occurrence and aspects of their evolution in extinct plants. The fossil record has important roles to play in establishing a chronology of when key fungal associations evolved and in understanding their importance in ecosystems through time. Together with calibrated phylogenetic trees, these approaches extend our understanding of when and how groups evolved in the context of major environmental change on a global scale. Phylogenomics furthers this understanding into the evolution of different types of mycorrhizal associations, and genomic studies of both plants and fungi are shedding light on how the complex set of symbiotic traits evolved. Here we present a review of the main phases of the evolution of mycorrhizal interactions from palaeontological, phylogenetic and genomic perspectives, with the aim of highlighting the potential of fossil material and a geological perspective in a cross‐disciplinary approach.},

              Ever since plants colonized land, they have evolved a range of mutualistic associations with bacteria and fungi. Indeed, such associations were probably required for plants to grow on harsh, nutrient-poor surfaces. Martin

Surprisingly, diverse functional plant-microbial symbioses have several common conserved features, including signaling pathways, immune evasion, and root development.

              {BACKGROUND}
              Among the extensive cortège of plant-associated microorganisms (the so-called plant microbiota), mutualistic fungal and bacterial symbionts are striking examples of soil microorganisms that have successfully coevolved with their hosts since plants adapted to terrestrial ecosystems. They promote plant growth by facilitating the acquisition of scarce nutrients. In these associations, plant root colonization requires complex molecular cross-talk between symbiotic partners to activate a variety of host developmental pathways and specialized symbiotic tissues and organs. Despite the evolutionary distances that separate mycorrhizal and nitrogen-fixing symbioses, recent research has identified certain highly conserved features associated with early stages of root colonization. We focus on recent and emerging areas of investigation concerning these major mutualistic symbioses and discuss some of the molecular pathways and cellular mechanisms involved in their evolution and development.
            
            
              {ADVANCES}
              Phylogenomic analyses and divergence time estimates based on symbiotic plant fossils are shedding light on the evolution of mutualistic symbioses. The earliest land plants [{\textasciitilde}407 million years ago (Ma)] were associated with fungi producing mycorrhiza-like intracellular structures similar to extant symbioses involving Glomeromycotina and Mucoromycotina. Arbuscular mycorrhizal endosymbioses then diversified by the Late Carboniferous. Pinaceae species from the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous ({\textasciitilde}180 Ma) formed the first ectomycorrhizal associations involving Dikarya. More recently, certain angiosperms evolved a “predisposition” for the evolution of nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbioses ({\textasciitilde}100 Ma) with bacteria.
              A conserved core module of the “common symbiotic signaling pathway” ({CSSP}) is shared by all host plants that establish endosymbioses, including arbuscular mycorrhizal, rhizobial, and actinorhizal associations. This striking conservation among widely divergent host species underlines the shared evolutionary origin for this ancient symbiotic signaling pathway. Furthermore, chitin-based signaling molecules secreted by both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia activate the host {CSSP} after perception by related receptor-like kinases. Downstream signal transduction pathways then lead to the apoplastic intracellular infection modes that characterize the majority of these associations and, finally, to the coordinated development of sophisticated bidirectional symbiotic interfaces found in both arbuscules and nitrogen-fixing nodules. A common feature of all these mutualistic associations is phytohormone-associated modifications of root development, which lead to an increase in potential colonization sites as well as major structural and functional changes to the root during the establishment of symbiotic tissues.
            
            
              {OUTLOOK}
              Although we are at last beginning to understand how mutualistic microorganisms communicate with plants, how associated root developmental pathways are modulated, and how plant immune responses are successfully circumvented, many important questions remain. For example, little is currently known about more primitive modes of intercellular apoplastic colonization, whether for ectomycorrhizal fungi or for certain nitrogen-fixing symbioses. Neither do we know whether the {CSSP} has a key role in ectomycorrhizal associations, nor how host plants distinguish between structurally similar chitin-based “symbiotic” and “pathogenic” microbial signals. Answering these questions should contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that govern the relationships between plants and their entire microbiota. On a broader level, improved understanding of how environmental and genetic cues, together with plant metabolism, modulate microbial colonization will be crucial for the future exploitation of the microbiota for the benefit of sustainable plant growth.
              
                
                  The major root symbioses established by land plants with soil microorganisms are arbuscular mycorrhizal, ectomycorrhizal, and nitrogen-fixing associations.

            Within the plant microbiota, mutualistic fungal and bacterial symbionts are striking examples of microorganisms playing crucial roles in nutrient acquisition. They have coevolved with their hosts since initial plant adaptation to land. Despite the evolutionary distances that separate mycorrhizal and nitrogen-fixing symbioses, these associations share a number of highly conserved features, including specific plant symbiotic signaling pathways, root colonization strategies that circumvent plant immune responses, functional host-microbe interface formation, and the central role of phytohormones in symbiosis-associated root developmental pathways. We highlight recent and emerging areas of investigation relating to these evolutionarily conserved mechanisms, with an emphasis on the more ancestral mycorrhizal associations, and consider to what extent this knowledge can contribute to an understanding of plant-microbiota associations as a whole.},
